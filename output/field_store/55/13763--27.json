[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#2)"],[1,"beautifully the sweet poet consoles us for these  misfortunes!\"  Oh, can these men love, my Clodius?  Scarcely even with  the senses.  How rarely a Roman has a heart!  He is but the mechanism of  genius--he wants its bones and flesh.'    Though Clodius was secretly a little sore at these remarks on his  countrymen, he affected to sympathize with his friend, partly because he  was by nature a parasite, and partly because it was the fashion among  the dissolute young Romans to affect a little contempt for the very  birth which, in reality, made them so arrogant; it was the mode to  imitate the Greeks, and yet to laugh at their own clumsy imitation.    Thus conversing, their steps were arrested by a crowd gathered round an  open space where three streets met; and, just where the porticoes of a  light and graceful temple threw their shade, there stood a young girl,  with a flower-basket on her right arm, and a small three-stringed  instrument of music in the left hand, to whose low and soft tones she  was modulating a wild and half-barbaric air.  At every pause in the  music she gracefully waved her flower-basket round, inviting the  loiterers to buy; and many a sesterce was showered into the basket,  either in compliment to the music or in compassion to the  songstress--for she was blind.    'It is my poor Thessalian,' said Glaucus, stopping; 'I have not seen her  since my return to Pompeii.  Hush! her voice is sweet; let us listen.'              THE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL'S SONG                        I.             Buy my flowers--O buy--I pray!             The blind girl comes from afar;           If the earth be as fair as I hear them say,             These flowers her children are!           Do they her beauty keep?             They are fresh from her lap, I know;           For I caught them fast asleep             In her arms an hour ago.             With the air which is her breath--            Her soft and delicate breath--            Over them murmuring low!            On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet,          And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet.          For she weeps--that gentle mother weeps--         (As morn and night her watch she keeps,          With a yearning heart and a passionate care)          To see the young things grow so fair;             She weeps--for love she weeps;             And the dews are the tears she weeps             From the well of a mother's love!                        II.             Ye have a world of light,             Where love in the loved rejoices;           But the blind girl's home is the House of Night,             And its beings are empty voices.               As one in the realm below,             I stand by the streams of woe!             I hear the vain shadows glide,             I feel their soft breath at my side.               And I thirst the loved forms to see,             And I stretch my fond arms around,             And I catch but a shapeless sound,             For the living are ghosts to me.                Come buy--come buy?--            (Hark! how the sweet things sigh             For they have a voice like ours),             `The breath of the blind girl closes             The leaves of the saddening roses--            We are tender, we sons of light,             We shrink from this child of night;             From the grasp of the blind girl free us--            We yearn for the eyes that see us--           We are for night too gay,             In your eyes we behold the day--               O buy--O buy the flowers!'    'I must have yon bunch of violets, sweet Nydia,' said Glaucus, pressing  through the crowd, and dropping a handful of small coins into the  basket; 'your voice is more charming than ever.'    The blind girl started forward as she heard the Athenian's voice; then  as suddenly paused, while the blood rushed violently over neck, cheek,  and temples.    'So you are returned!' said she, in a low voice; and then repeated half  to herself, 'Glaucus is returned!'    'Yes, child, I have not been at Pompeii above a few days.  My garden  wants your care, as before; you will visit it, I trust, to-morrow.  And  mind, no garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands but those of  the pretty Nydia.'    Nydia smiled joyously, but did not answer; and Glaucus, placing in his  breast the violets he had selected, turned gaily and carelessly from the  crowd.    'So she is a sort of client of yours, this child?' said Clodius.    'Ay--does she not sing prettily?  She interests me, the poor slave!  Besides, she is from the land of the Gods' hill--Olympus frowned upon  her cradle--she is of Thessaly.'    'The witches' country.'    'True: but for my part I find every woman a witch; and at Pompeii, by  Venus! the very air seems to have taken a love-philtre, so handsome does  every face without a beard seem in my eyes.'    'And lo! one of the handsomest in Pompeii, old Diomed's daughter, the  rich Julia!' said Clodius, as a young lady, her face covered by her  veil, and attended by two female slaves, approached them, in her way to  the baths.    'Fair Julia, we salute thee!' said Clodius.    Julia partly raised her veil, so as with some coquetry to display a bold  Roman profile, a full dark bright eye, and a cheek over whose natural  olive art shed a fairer and softer rose.    'And Glaucus, too, is returned!' said she, glancing meaningly at the  Athenian.  'Has he forgotten,' she added, in a half-whisper, 'his  friends of the last year?'    'Beautiful Julia! even Lethe itself, if it disappear in one part of the  earth, rises again in another.  Jupiter does not allow us ever to forget  for more than a moment: but Venus, more harsh still, vouchsafes not even  a moment's oblivion.'    'Glaucus is never at a loss for fair words.'    'Who is, when the object of them is so fair?'    'We shall see you both at my father's villa soon,' said Julia, turning  to Clodius.    'We will mark the day in which we visit you with a white stone,'  answered the gamester.    Julia dropped her veil, but slowly, so that her last glance rested on  the Athenian with affected timidity and real boldness; the glance  bespoke tenderness and reproach.    The friends passed on.    'Julia is certainly handsome,' said Glaucus.    'And last year you would have made that confession in a warmer tone.'    'True; I was dazzled at the first sight, and mistook for a gem that  which was but an artful imitation.'    'Nay,' returned Clodius, 'all women are the same at heart.  Happy he who  weds a handsome face and a large dower.  What more can he desire?'    Glaucus sighed.    They were now in a street less crowded than the rest, at the end of  which they beheld that broad and most lovely sea, which upon those  delicious coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative of terror--so  soft are the crisping winds that hover around its bosom, so glowing and  so various are the hues which it takes from the rosy clouds, so fragrant  are the perfumes which the breezes from the land scatter over its  depths.  From such a sea might you well believe that Aphrodite rose to  take the empire of the earth.    'It is still early for the bath,' said the Greek, who was the creature  of every poetical impulse; 'let us wander from the crowded city, and  look upon the sea while the noon yet laughs along its billows.'    'With all my heart,' said Clodius; 'and the bay, too, is always the most  animated part of the city.'    Pompeii was the miniature of the civilization of that age. Within the  narrow compass of its walls was contained, as it were, a specimen of  every gift which luxury offered to power.  In its minute but glittering  shops, its tiny palaces, its baths, its forum, its theatre, its  circus--in the energy yet corruption, in the refinement yet the vice, of  its people, you beheld a model of the whole empire. It was a toy, a  plaything, a showbox, in which the gods seemed pleased to keep the  representation of the great monarchy of earth, and which they afterwards  hid from time, to give to the wonder of posterity--the moral of the  maxim, that under the sun there is nothing new.    Crowded in the glassy bay were the vessels of commerce and the gilded  galleys for the pleasures of the rich citizens.  The boats of the  fishermen glided rapidly to and fro; and afar off you saw the tall masts  of the fleet under the command of Pliny.  Upon the shore sat a Sicilian  who, with vehement gestures and flexile features, was narrating to a  group of fishermen and peasants a strange tale of shipwrecked mariners  and friendly dolphins--just as at this day, in the modern neighborhood,  you may hear upon the Mole of Naples.    Drawing his comrade from the crowd, the Greek bent his steps towards a  solitary part of the beach, and the two friends, seated on a small crag  which rose amidst the smooth pebbles, inhaled the voluptuous and cooling  breeze, which dancing over the waters, kept music with its invisible  feet. There was, perhaps, something in the scene that invited them to  silence and reverie.  Clodius, shading his eyes from the burning sky,  was calculating the gains of the last week; and the Greek, leaning upon  his hand, and shrinking not from that sun--his nation's tutelary  deity--with whose fluent light of poesy, and joy, and love, his own  veins were filled, gazed upon the broad expanse, and envied, perhaps,  every wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece.    'Tell me, Clodius,' said the Greek at last, 'hast thou ever been in  love?'    'Yes, very often.'    'He who has loved often,' answered Glaucus, 'has loved never. There is  but one Eros, though there are many counterfeits of him.'    'The counterfeits are not bad little gods, upon the whole,' answered  Clodius.    'I agree with you,' returned the Greek.  'I adore even the shadow of  Love; but I adore himself yet more.'    'Art thou, then, soberly and honestly in love?  Hast thou that feeling  which the poets describe--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#2)"],[1,"\"Open the door for me, my dear  children. I am your mother.\"    But the oldest little goat thought of what his mother had said.    \"If you are our mother, put your foot on the window sill, that we may  see it.\"    When the wolf had done this, all the little goats cried out, \"No, you  are not our mother. We shall not open the door. Our mother's feet, are  white and yours are black. Go away; you are the wolf.\"    [Illustration]    Then the wolf went to the miller's, and said to him, \"Mr. Miller, put  some flour on my foot, for I have hurt it.\"    The miller was so afraid of the wolf that he did as he was told.    Then the wicked wolf went to the goat's house again and said, \"Open the  door, dear children, for I am your mother.\"    \"Show us your foot,\" said the little kids.    So the wolf put his one white foot on the window sill.    When the little kids saw that it was white, they thought this was really  their mother, and they opened the door.    In jumped the ugly old wolf, and all the little kids ran to hide  themselves.    The first hid under the table, the second in the bed, the third in the  oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth  under the washtub, and the seventh, who was the smallest of all, in the  tall clock.    The wolf quickly found and gobbled up all but the youngest, who was in  the clock.    Then the wolf, who felt sleepy, went out and lay down on the green  grass.    Soon he was fast asleep.      THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN YOUNG KIDS--II    Not long after this the old goat came home from the woods.    Ah, what did she see! The house door was wide open; the tables and  chairs were upset.    The washtub was broken in pieces, and the bed was tipped over.    \"Where are my dear children?\" cried the poor goat.    At last she heard a little voice crying, \"Dear mother, here I am in the  tall clock.\"    The old goat helped the little goat out.    Soon she learned how the wolf had eaten her dear children.    Then she went out of the hut, and there on the grass lay the wolf sound  asleep.    As the goat looked at the wicked old wolf, she thought she saw something  jumping about inside him.    \"Ah,\" she said, \"it may be that my poor children are still alive.\"    So she sent the little kid into the house for a pair of scissors and a  needle and some thread.    She quickly cut a hole in the side of the wicked old wolf.    At the first snip of the scissors, one of the kids stuck out his head.    As the old goat cut, more and more heads popped out.    At last all six of the kids jumped out upon the grass.    They went hopping and skipping about their mother.    Then the old goat said to them, \"Go and bring me some large stones from  the brook.\"    The seven little kids ran off to the brook and soon came back with seven  large stones.    They put these stones inside the wicked old wolf.    [Illustration]    The old goat sewed up the wolf's side so gently and quietly that he did  not wake up nor move.    When at last the wicked wolf did wake up, the great stones inside him  made him feel very heavy.    He was thirsty, too, so he walked down to the brook to drink.    The stones were so heavy that they tipped him over the edge of the bank  into the deep water, and he was drowned.    WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM              THEY DIDN'T THINK        danger  folks  seized          Once a trap was baited        With a piece of cheese;      It tickled so a little mouse,        It almost made him sneeze.      An old rat said, \"There's danger,        Be careful where you go!\"      \"Nonsense!\" said the other,        \"I don't think you know!\"      So he walked in boldly--        Nobody in sight--      First he took a nibble,        Then he took a bite;      Close the trap together        Snapped as quick as wink,      Catching mousey fast there,        'Cause he didn't think.        Once there was a robin,        Lived outside the door,      Who wanted to go inside        And hop upon the floor.      \"No, no,\" said the mother,        \"You must stay with me;      Little birds are safest        Sitting in a tree.\"      \"I don't care,\" said Robin,        And gave his tail a fling,      \"I don't think the old folks        Know quite everything.\"      Down he flew, and kitty seized him        Before he'd time to blink;      \"Oh,\" he cried, \"I'm sorry,        But I didn't think.\"        PHOEBE CARY    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    TOM THUMB--I    thumb  people  suit  reins  fought  frightened  brought  thistledown      In the days of King Arthur, there lived a wise man named Merlin.    He knew all the fairies and where they lived.    Even the fairy queen was a friend of his.    Once, while he was traveling, night overtook him in a deep forest.    He rapped at the door of a small cottage and asked for some food.    Merlin looked so hungry and poor that the farmer and his wife took pity  on him.    They not only gave him a bowl of milk with some brown bread, but they  said he might stay through the night.    Merlin saw that, in spite of their pleasant cottage, both the farmer and  his wife were very sad.    \"Why are you sad?\" asked Merlin.    \"You seem to have a good farm, a pleasant cottage, and many things to  make you happy.\"    \"Ah!\" said the woman, \"we are unhappy because we have no child.    I should be the happiest woman in the world if I had a son.    Why, even if he were no bigger than my husband's thumb, we should love  him dearly.\"    \"That would be indeed a very strange kind of child,\" said Merlin, \"but  I hope you may have your wish.\"    Now Merlin was on his way to call on the queen of the fairies.    When he came to her castle the next day, he told the fairy queen the  wish of the farmer's wife.    The queen of the fairies said, \"The good woman shall have her wish. I  will give her a son no larger than her husband's thumb.\"      TOM THUMB--II    Soon after this the good farmer's wife had a son. He was, indeed, just  the size of his father's thumb.    People came from far and wide to see the tiny boy.    One day the fairy queen and some other fairies came to see him.    The queen kissed the little boy and named him Tom Thumb.    [Illustration]    Each of the other fairies made Tom a gift.    He had a shirt made of silk from a spider's web, a coat of thistledown,  a hat made from the leaf of an oak, tiny shoes made from a mouse's skin,  and many other gifts besides.    Tom never grew any larger than a man's thumb, but he could do many  clever tricks.    One day his mother was mixing a pudding.    Tom leaned over the edge of the bowl to see how it was made.    He slipped, and in he went, head first.    His mother did not see him fall, and kept stirring and stirring the  pudding.    Tom could not see nor hear, but he kicked and kicked inside the pudding.    The pudding moved and tossed about.    His mother was afraid.    She did not know what to think.    \"There must be witches in it,\" she said.    She went to the window to throw the pudding out.    Just then a poor beggar was passing by the house.    \"Here is a pudding you may have, if you like,\" said Tom's mother.    The beggar thanked her and put it into his basket.    He had not gone very far, when Tom got his head out of the pudding and  shouted in a shrill voice:    \"Take me out! take me out!\"    The poor beggar was so frightened that he dropped his basket, pudding  and all, and ran off as fast as he could.    Tom crawled out of the pudding, climbed out of the basket, and ran home.    His mother washed him and put him to bed.      TOM THUMB--III    Not long after this Tom's mother took him with her when she went to milk  the cow.    That he might not get lost, she tied him to a wisp of hay.    When Tom's mother was not looking, the cow took the wisp of hay into her  mouth.    She began to chew and chew.    Tom began to jump about and shout.    He frightened the cow so that she opened her great mouth and out Tom  jumped.    Then Tom's mother took him in her apron and ran with him to the house,  but he was not hurt in the least.    [Illustration]    One day Tom was in the field helping his father.    \"Let me drive the horse home,\" said Tom \"You drive the horse!\" said his  father.    \"How could you hold the reins?\"    \"I could stand in the horse's ear and tell him which way to go,\" said  Tom.    So his father put him in the horse's ear, and he drove safely home.    \"Mother! mother!\" cried Tom.    But when Tom's mother came out, she could see no one.    She began to be afraid.    \"Where are you, Tom?\" she cried.    \"Here I am in the horse's ear. Please take me down,\" said Tom.    His mother lifted him gently down, kissed him, and gave him a blackberry  for his supper.    Tom's father made him a whip out of a straw.    Tom tried to drive the cows, but he fell into a deep ditch.    There a great bird saw him and thought he was a mouse.    The bird seized Tom in her claws and carried him toward her nest.    As they were passing over the sea, Tom got away and fell into the water,  where a great fish swallowed him at one mouthful.    Soon after this the fish was caught, and it was such a big one that it  was sent at once to King Arthur.    When the cook cut open the fish, out jumped Tom Thumb. Tom was brought  before the king, and his story was told.      TOM THUMB--IV    The king grew very fond of Tom and his wise sayings. He took Tom with  him wherever he went.    If it began to rain, Tom would creep into the king's pocket and sleep  until the rain was over.    The king had a new suit made for Tom, and gave him a needle for a sword.    A mouse was trained for Tom to ride.    The king and queen never tired of seeing him ride his queer little horse  and bravely wave his sword.    One day, as they were going hunting, a cat jumped out and caught Tom's  mouse.    [Illustration]    Tom drew his sword and tried to drive the cat away.    The king ran to help poor Tom, but the little mouse was dead, and Tom  was scratched and bitten.    Tom was "]]]
