[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#2)"],[1,"periods I read an  original document relating to the events at the beginning of the war.  This was a typewritten letter signed by the Director of the Post and  Telegraph.  Because I was always watched by a soldier escort, I could  never copy it.  But after reading it scores of times I soon memorised  everything, including the periods.    This document was as follows:        Office of the Imperial Post & Telegraph          August 2nd, 1914.      Announcement No. 3.    To the Chief Telegraph Office:    From to-day on, the Post and Telegraph communications between Germany  on the one hand and:      1. England,    2. France,    3. Russia,    4. Japan,    5. Belgium,    6. Italy,    7. Montenegro,    8. Servia,    9. Portugal;    on the other hand are interrupted because Germany finds herself in a  state of war.    (Signed) Director of the Post and Telegraph.      This notice, which was never published, shows that the man who directed  the Post and Telegraph Service of the Imperial Government knew on the  2nd of August, 1914, who Germany's enemies would be.  Of the eleven  enemies of Germany to-day only Roumania and the United States were not  included.  If the Director of the Post and Telegraph knew what to  expect, it is certain that the Imperial Government knew.  This  announcement shows that Germany expected war with nine different  nations, but at the time it was posted on the bulletin board of the  Haupttelegraphenamt, neither Italy, Japan, Belgium nor Portugal had  declared war.  Italy did not declare war until nearly a year and a half  afterwards, Portugal nearly two years afterward and Japan not until  December, 1914.    This document throws an interesting light upon the preparations Germany  made for a world war.    The White, Yellow, Grey and Blue Books, which all of the belligerents  published after the beginning of the war, dealt only with the attempts  of these nations to prevent the war.  None of the nations has as yet  published white books to show how it prepared for war, and still, every  nation in Europe had been expecting and preparing for a European  conflagration.  Winston Churchill, when he was First Lord of the  Admiralty, stated at the beginning of the war that England's fleet was  mobilised.  France had contributed millions of francs to fortify the  Russian border in Poland, although Germany had made most of the guns.  Belgium had what the Kaiser called, \"a contemptible little army\" but  the soldiers knew how to fight when the invaders came.  Germany had new  42 cm. guns and a network of railroads which operated like shuttles  between the Russian and French and Belgian frontiers.  Ever since 1870  Europe had been talking war.  Children were brought up and educated  into the belief that some day war would come.  Most people considered  it inevitable, although not every one wanted it.    During the exciting days of August, 1914, I was calling at the  belligerent embassies and legations in Washington.  Neither M.  Jusserand, the French Ambassador, nor Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the  British Ambassador, nor Count von Bernstorff, the Kaiser's  representative, were in Washington then.  But it was not many weeks  until all three had hastened to this country from Europe.  Almost the  first act of the belligerents was to send their envoys to Washington.    As I met these men I was in a sense an agent of public opinion who  called each day to report the opinions of the belligerents to the  readers of American newspapers.  One day at the British Embassy I was  given copies of the White Book and of many other documents which Great  Britain had issued to show how she tried to avoid the war.  In  conversations later with Ambassador von Bernstorff, I was given the  German viewpoint.    The thing which impressed me at the time was the desire of these  officials to get their opinions before the American people.  But why  did these ambassadors want the standpoints of their governments  understood over here?  Why was the United States singled out of all  other neutrals?  If all the belligerents really wanted to avoid war,  why did they not begin twenty years before, to prevent it, instead of,  to prepare for it?    All the powers issued their official documents for one primary  purpose--to win public opinion.  First, it was necessary for each  country to convince its own people that their country was being  attacked and that their leaders had done everything possible to avoid  war.  Even in Europe people would not fight without a reason.  The  German Government told the people that unless the army was mobilised  immediately Russia would invade and seize East Prussia.  England,  France and Belgium explained to their people that Germany was out to  conquer the world by way of Belgium and France.  But White Books were  not circulated alone in Europe; they were sent by the hundreds of  thousands into the United States and translated into every known  language so that the people of the whole world could read them.    Then the word battles between the Allies and the Central Powers began  in the United States.  While the soldiers fought on the battlefields of  Belgium, France, East Prussia and Poland, an equally bitter struggle  was carried on in the United States.  In Europe the object was to stop  the invaders.  In America the goal was public opinion.    It was not until several months after the beginning of the war that Sir  Edward Grey and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg began to discuss what  the two countries had done before the war, to avoid it.  The only thing  either nation could refer to was the 1912 Conference between Lord  Haldane and the Chancellor.  This was the only real attempt made by the  two leading belligerents to come to an understanding to avoid  inevitable bloodshed.  Discussions of these conferences were soon  hushed up in Europe because of the bitterness of the people against  each other.  The Hymn of Hate had stirred the German people and the  Zeppelin raids were beginning to sow the seeds of determination in the  hearts of the British.  It was too late to talk about why the war was  not prevented.  So each set of belligerents had to rely upon the  official documents at the beginning of the war to show what was done to  avoid it.    These White Books were written to win public opinion.  But why were the  people _suddenly_ taken into the confidence of their governments?  Why  had the governments of England, France, Germany and Russia not been so  frank before 1914?  Why had they all been interested in making the  people speculate as to what would come, and how it would come about?  Why were all the nations encouraging suspicion?  Why did they always  question the motives, as well as the acts, of each other?  Is it  possible that the world progressed faster than the governments and that  the governments suddenly realised that public opinion was the biggest  factor in the world?  Each one knew that a war could not be waged  without public support and each one knew that the sympathy of the  outside world depended more upon public opinion than upon business or  military relations.      II    How America Was Shocked by the War    Previous to July, 1914, the American people had thought very little  about a European war.  While the war parties and financiers of Europe  had been preparing a long time for the conflict, people over here had  been thinking about peace.  Americans discussed more of the  possibilities of international peace and arbitration than war.  Europeans lived through nothing except an expectancy of war.  Even the  people knew who the enemies might be.  The German government, as the  announcement of the Post and Telegraph Director shows, knew nine of its  possible enemies before war had been declared.  So it was but natural,  when the first reports reached the United States saying that the  greatest powers of Europe were engaged in a death struggle, that people  were shocked and horrified.  And it was but natural for thousands of  them to besiege President Wilson with requests for him to offer his  services as a mediator.    The war came, too, during the holiday season in Europe.  Over 90,000  Americans were in the war zones.  The State Department was flooded with  telegrams.  Senators and Congressmen were urged to use their influence  to get money to stranded Americans to help them home.  The 235 U.S.  diplomatic and consular representatives were asked to locate Americans  and see to their comfort and safety.  Not until Americans realised how  closely they were related to Europe could they picture themselves as  having a direct interest in the war.  Then the stock market began to  tumble.  The New York Stock Exchange was closed.  South America asked  New York for credit and supplies, and neutral Europe, as well as China  in the Far East, looked to the United States to keep the war within  bounds.  Uncle Sam became the Atlas of the world and nearly every  belligerent requested this government to take over its diplomatic and  consular interests in enemy countries.  Diplomacy, commerce, finance  and shipping suddenly became dependent upon this country.  Not only the  belligerents but the neutrals sought the leadership of a nation which  could look after all the interests, except those of purely military and  naval operations.  The eyes of the world centred upon Washington.  President Wilson, as the official head of the government, was signalled  out as the one man to help them in their suffering and to listen to  their appeals.  The belligerent governments addressed their protests  and their notes to Wilson.  Belgium sent a special commission to gain  the President's ear.  The peace friends throughout the world, even  those in the belligerent countries, looked to Wilson for guidance and  help.    In August, 1914, Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, the President's wife, was  dangerously ill.  I was at the White House every day to report the  developments there for the United Press.

Two days after, they  discovered another that was high, with a plain on the top. This is probably  the same that Captain Carteret calls Pitcairn's Island.    After leaving these islands, Quiros seems to have directed his course to  W.N.W. and N.W. to 10 deg. or 11 deg. S. latitude, and then westward, till he  arrived at the Bay of St Philip and Jago, in the Island of Tierra del  Espirito Santo. In this route be discovered several islands; probably some  of those that have been seen by later navigators.    On leaving the bay of St Philip and St Jago, the two ships were separated.  Quiros, with the Capitana, stood to the north, and returned to New Spain,  after having suffered greatly for want of provisions and water. Torres,  with the Almiranta and the tender, steered to the west, and seems to have  been the first who sailed between New Holland and New Guinea.    1615. Le Maire and Schouten    The next attempt to make discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, was  conducted by Le Maire and Schouten. They sailed from the Texel, on the 14th  of June, 1615, with the ships Concord and Horn. The latter was burnt by  accident in Port Desire. With the other they discovered the straits that  bear the name of Le Maire, and were the first who ever entered the Pacific  Ocean, by the way of Cape Horn.    They discovered the island of Dogs, in latitude 15 deg. 15' S., longitude 136 deg.  30' W.; Sondre Grondt in 15 deg. S. latitude, and 143 deg. 10' W. longitude;  Waterland in 14 deg. 46' S., and 144 deg. 10' W.; and twenty-five leagues westward  of this, Fly Island, in latitude 15 deg. 20'; Traitor's and Coco's Islands, in  latitude 15 deg. 43' S., longitude 173 deg. 13' W.; two degrees more to the  westward, the isle of Hope; and in the latitude of 14 deg. 56' S., longitude  179 deg. 30' E., Horn Island.    They next coasted the north side of New Britain and New Guinea, and arrived  at Batavia in October, 1616.    1642 Tasman.    Except some discoveries on the western and northern coasts of New Holland,  no important voyage to the Pacific Ocean was undertaken till 1642, when  Captain Tasman sailed from Batavia, with two ships belonging to the Dutch  East India Company, and discovered Van Diemen's Land; a small part of the  western coast of New Zealand; the Friendly Isles; and those called Prince  William's.    1594 Sir Richard Hawkins.    Thus far I have thought it best not to interrupt the progress of discovery  in the South Pacific Ocean, otherwise I should before have mentioned, that  Sir Richard Hawkins in 1594, being about fifty leagues to the eastward of  the river Plate, was driven by a storm to the eastward of his intended  course, and when the weather grew moderate, steering towards the Straits of  Magalhaens, he unexpectedly fell in with land, about sixty leagues of which  he coasted, and has very particularly described. This he named Hawkins's  Maiden Land, in honour of his royal mistress, Queen Elizabeth, and says it  lies some threescore leagues from the nearest part of South America.    1689 Strong.    This land was afterwards discovered to be two large islands, by Captain  John Strong, of the Farewell, from London, who, in 1689, passed through the  strait which divides the eastern from the western of those islands. To this  strait he gave the name of Falkland's Sound, in honour of his patron Lord  Falkland; and the name has since been extended, through inadvertency, to  the two islands it separates.    Having mentioned these islands, I will add, that future navigators will  mis-spend their time, if they look for Pepy's Island in 47 deg. S.; it being  now certain, that Pepy's Island is no other than these islands of  Falkland.    1675 La Roche.    In April, 1675, Anthony la Roche, an English merchant, in his return from  the South Pacific Ocean, where he had been on a trading voyage, being  carried by the winds and currents, far to the east of Strait Le Maire, fell  in with a coast, which may possibly be the same with that which I visited  during this voyage, and have called the Island of Georgia.    Leaving this land, and sailing to the north, La Roche, in the latitude of  45 deg. S., discovered a large island, with a good port towards the eastern  part, where he found wood, water, and fish.    1699 Halley.    In 1699, that celebrated astronomer, Dr Edmund Halley, was appointed to the  command of his majesty's ship the Paramour Pink, on an expedition for  improving the knowledge of the longitude, and of the variation of the  compass; and for discovering the unknown lands supposed to lie in the  southern part of the Atlantic Ocean. In this voyage he determined the  longitude of several places; and, after his return, constructed his  variation-chart, and proposed a method of observing the longitude at sea,  by means of the appulses and occultations of the fixed stars. But, though  he so successfully attended to the two first articles of his instructions,  he did not find any unknown southern land.    1721 Roggewein.    The Dutch, in 1721, fitted out three ships to make discoveries in the South  Pacific Ocean, under the command of Admiral Roggewein. He left the Texel on  the 21st of August, and arriving in that ocean, by going round Cape Horn,  discovered Easter Island, probably seen before, though not visited, by  Davis;* then between 14 deg. 41' and 15 deg. 47' S. latitude, and between the  longitude of 142 deg. and 150 deg. W., fell in with several other islands, which I  take to be some of those seen by the late English navigators. He next  discovered two islands in latitude 15 deg. S., longitude 170 deg. W., which he  called Baumen's Islands; and, lastly, Single Island, in latitude 13 deg. 41'  S., longitude 171 deg. 30' W. These three islands are, undoubtedly, the same  that Bougainville calls the Isles of Navigators.    [* See Waser's description of the Isthmus of Darien.]    1738 Bouvet.    In 1738, the French East India Company sent Lozier Bouvet with two ships,  the Eagle and Mary, to make discoveries in the South Atlantic Ocean. He  sailed from Port L'Orient on the 19th of July in that year; touched at the  island of St Catherine; and from thence shaped his course towards the  south-east.    On the 1st of January, 1739, he discovered land, or what he judged to be  land, in latitude 54 deg. S., longitude 11 deg. E. It will appear in the course of  the following narrative, that we made several attempts to find this land  without success. It is, therefore, very probable, that what Bouvet saw was  nothing more than a large ice-island. From hence he stood to the east, in  51 deg. of latitude to 35 deg. of E. longitude: After which the two ships  separated, one going to the island of Mauritius, and the other returning to  France.    After this voyage of Bouvet, the spirit of discovery ceased, till his  present majesty formed a design of making discoveries, and exploring the  southern hemisphere; and, in the year 1764, directed it to be put in  execution.    1764 Byron.    Accordingly Commodore Byron, having under his command the Dolphin and  Tamer, sailed from the Downs on the 21st of June the same year; and having  visited the Falkland Islands, passed through the Straits of Magalhaens into  the Pacific Ocean, where he discovered the islands of Disappointment,  George's, Prince of Wales's, the isles of Danger, York Island, and Byron  Island.    1766 Wallis.    He returned to England the 9th of May, 1766, and, in the month of August  following, the Dolphin was again sent out under the command of Captain  Wallis, with the Swallow, commanded by Captain Carteret.    They proceeded together, till they came to the west end of the Straits of  Magalhaens, and the Great South Sea in sight, where they were separated.    Captain Wallis directed his course more westerly than any navigator had  done before him in so high a latitude; but met with no land till he got  within the tropic, where he discovered the islands of Whitsunday, Queen  Charlotte, Egmont, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Cumberland, Maitea,  Otaheite, Eimeo, Tapamanou, How, Scilly, Boscawen, Keppel, and Wallis; and  returned to England in May, 1768.    Carteret.    His companion Captain Carteret kept a different route, in which he  discovered the islands of Osnaburg, Gloucester, Queen Charlotte's Isles,  Carteret's, Gower's, and the strait between New Britain and New Ireland;  and returned to England in March, 1769.    1766 Bougainville.    In November, 1766, Commodore Bougainville sailed from France in the frigate  La Boudeuse, with the store-ship L'Etoile. After spending some time on the  coast of Brazil, and at Falkland's Islands, he got into the Pacific Sea by  the Straits of Magalhaens, in January, 1768.    In this ocean he discovered the Four Facardines, the isle of Lanciers, and  Harp Island, which I take to be the same that I afterwards named Lagoon,  Thrum Cap, and Bow Island. About twenty leagues farther to the west he  discovered four other islands; afterwards fell in with Maitea, Otaheite,  isles of Navigators, and Forlorn Hope, which to him were new discoveries.  He then passed through between the Hebrides, discovered the Shoal of Diana,  and some others, the land of Cape Deliverance, several islands more to the  north, passed the north of New Ireland, touched at Batavia, and arrived in  France in March, 1769.    This year was rendered remarkable by the transit of the planet Venus over  the sun's disk, a phenomenon of great importance to astronomy; and which  every-where engaged the attention of the learned in that science.    In the beginning of the 1768, the Royal Society presented a memorial to his  majesty, setting forth the advantages to be derived from accurate  observations of this transit in different parts of the world; particularly  from a set of such observations made in a southern latitude, between the  140th and 130th degrees of longitude, west from the Royal Observatory at  Greenwich; and that vessels, properly equipped,"]]]
