The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it--and  the chalk-quarry on one side and the gravel-pit on the other. Down at  the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white  buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other  houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting,  the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the  limekilns and hop-drying houses glimmered and glittered till they were  like an enchanted city out of the _Arabian Nights_.    Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could  go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the  ordinary things that the children did,--just the kind of things you do  yourself, you know, and you would believe every word of it; and when I  told about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your  aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, \"How  true!\" or \"How like life!\" and you would see it and would very likely be  annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that  happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts  and uncles either are likely to write \"How true!\" on the edge of the  story. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really  wonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children  will believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they  tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see  perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the  earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the  sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as  it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet  I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so  you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and  the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At  least they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and  of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever  saw or heard of or read about.    It was at the gravel-pits. Father had to go away suddenly on business,  and mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very well.  They both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house  seemed dreadfully quiet and empty, and the children wandered from one  room to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors  left over from the packing, and not yet cleared up, and wished they had  something to do. It was Cyril who said--    \"I say, let's take our spades and dig in the gravel-pits. We can pretend  it's seaside.\"    \"Father says it was once,\" Anthea said; \"he says there are shells there  thousands of years old.\"    So they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the gravel-pit and  looked over, but they had not gone down into it for fear father should  say they mustn't play there, and it was the same with the chalk-quarry.  The gravel-pit is not really dangerous if you don't try to climb down  the edges, but go the slow safe way round by the road, as if you were a  cart.    Each of the children carried its own spade, and took it in turns to  carry the Lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because \"Baa\"  was the first thing he ever said. They called Anthea \"Panther,\" which  seems silly when you read it, but when you say it it sounds a little  like her name.    The gravel-pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round the  edges at the top, and dry stringy wildflowers, purple and yellow. It is  like a giant's washbowl. And there are mounds of gravel, and holes in  the sides of the bowl where gravel has been taken out, and high up in  the steep sides there are the little holes that are the little front  doors of the little bank-martins' little houses.    The children built a castle, of course, but castle-building is rather  poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in to  fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and, at the happy last,  to wet everybody up to the waist at least.    Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in, but the others  thought it might bury them alive, so it ended in all spades going to  work to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. These children, you  see, believed that the world was round, and that on the other side the  little Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like  flies on the ceiling, with their heads hanging down into the air.    The children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy  and hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The Lamb had tried  to eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not,  as he had supposed, brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was  lying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the half-finished  castle. This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and  the hole that was to come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane,  who was called Pussy for short, begged the others to stop.    \"Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly,\" said she, \"and you  tumbled out among the little Australians, all the sand would get in  their eyes.\"    \"Yes,\" said Robert; \"and they would hate us, and throw stones at us, and  not let us see the kangaroos, or opossums, or bluegums, or Emu Brand  birds, or anything.\"    Cyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that,  but they agreed to stop using the spades and to go on with their hands.  This was quite easy, because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very  soft and fine and dry, like sea-sand. And there were little shells in  it.    \"Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and shiny,\" said  Jane, \"with fishes and conger-eels and coral and mermaids.\"    \"And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure. I wish we could find a  gold doubloon, or something,\" Cyril said.    \"How did the sea get carried away?\" Robert asked.    \"Not in a pail, silly,\" said his brother.    \"Father says the earth got too hot underneath, as you do in bed  sometimes, so it just hunched up its shoulders, and the sea had to slip  off, like the blankets do us, and the shoulder was left sticking out,  and turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells; I think that  little cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a  bit of wrecked ship's anchor, and it's beastly hot in the Australian  hole.\"    The others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to  finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a  disgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia.    The cave was disappointing, because there were no shells, and the  wrecked ship's anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pick-axe  handle, and the cave party were just making up their minds that sand  makes you thirstier when it is not by the seaside, and someone had  suggested that they all go home for lemonade, when Anthea suddenly  screamed--    \"Cyril! Come here! Oh, come quick--It's alive! It'll get away! Quick!\"    They all hurried back.    \"It's a rat, I shouldn't wonder,\" said Robert. \"Father says they infest  old places--and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of  years ago\"--    \"Perhaps it is a snake,\" said Jane, shuddering.    \"Let's look,\" said Cyril, jumping into the hole. \"I'm not afraid of  snakes. I like them. If it is a snake I'll tame it, and it will follow  me everywhere, and I'll let it sleep round my neck at night.\"    \"No, you won't,\" said Robert firmly. He shared Cyril's bedroom. \"But  you may if it's a rat.\"    [Illustration: Anthea suddenly screamed, \"It's alive!\"]    \"Oh, don't be silly!\" said Anthea; \"it's not a rat, it's _much_ bigger.  And it's not a snake. It's got feet; I saw them; and fur! No--not the  spade. You'll hurt it! Dig with your hands.\"    \"And let _it_ hurt _me_ instead! That's so likely, isn't it?\" said  Cyril, seizing a spade.    \"Oh, don't!\" said Anthea. \"Squirrel, _don't_. I--it sounds silly, but it  said something. It really and truly did\"--    \"What?\"    \"It said, 'You let me alone.'\"    But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her head,  and he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the  hole, jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully,  and presently everyone could see that there really was something moving  in the bottom of the Australian hole.    Then Anthea cried out, \"_I'm_ not afraid. Let me dig,\" and fell on her  knees and began to scratch like a dog does when he has suddenly  remembered where it was that he buried his bone.    \"Oh, I felt fur,\" she cried, half laughing and half crying. \"I did  indeed! I did!\" when suddenly a dry husky voice in the sand made them  all jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did.    \"Let me alone,\" it said. And now everyone heard the voice and looked at  the others to see if they had heard it too.    \"But we want to see you,\" said Robert bravely.    \"I wish you'd come out,\" said Anthea, also taking courage.    \"Oh, well--if that's your wish,\" the voice said, and the sand stirred  and spun and scattered, and something brown and furry and fat came  rolling out into the hole, and the sand fell off it, and it sat there  yawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands.    \"I believe I must have dropped asleep,\" it said, stretching itself.    The children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature  they had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns  like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes;  it had ears like a bat's ears, and its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17321"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent (#2)"],[1,"own  day, and have yielded up to us the facts from which we have derived our  knowledge of prehistoric Egypt. Thus it is that we know so much of the  Egyptians of the Stone Age, while of their contemporaries in Mesopotamia  we know nothing, nor is anything further likely to be discovered.    But these desert cemeteries, with their crowds of oval shallow graves,  covered by only a few inches of surface soil, in which the Neolithic  Egyptians lie crouched up with their flint implements and polished  pottery beside them, are but monuments of the later age of prehistoric  Egypt. Long before the Neolithic Egyptian hunted his game in the  marshes, and here and there essayed the work of reclamation for the  purposes of an incipient agriculture, a far older race inhabited the  valley of the Nile. The written records of Egyptian civilization go back  four thousand years before Christ, or earlier, and the Neolithic Age of  Egypt must go back to a period several thousand years before that. But  we can now go back much further still, to the Palaeolithic Age of Egypt.  At a time when Europe was still covered by the ice and snows of the  Glacial Period, and man fought as an equal, hardly yet as a superior,  with cave-bear and mammoth, the Palaeolithic Egyptians lived on the  banks of the Nile. Their habitat was doubtless the desert slopes, often,  too, the plateaus themselves; but that they lived entirely upon the  plateaus, high up above the Nile marsh, is improbable. There, it is  true, we find their flint implements, the great pear-shaped weapons of  the types of Chelles, St. Acheul, and Le Moustier, types well known  to all who are acquainted with the flint implements of the \"Drift\" in  Europe. And it is there that the theory, generally accepted hitherto,  has placed the habitat of the makers and users of these implements.    The idea was that in Palaeolithic days, contemporary with the Glacial  Age of Northern Europe and America, the climate of Egypt was entirely  different from that of later times and of to-day. Instead of dry desert,  the mountain plateaus bordering the Nile valley were supposed to have  been then covered with forest, through which flowed countless streams  to feed the river below. It was suggested that remains of these streams  were to be seen in the side ravines, or wadis, of the Nile valley, which  run up from the low desert on the river level into the hills on either  hand. These wadis undoubtedly show extensive traces of strong water  action; they curve and twist as the streams found their easiest way  to the level through the softer strata, they are heaped up with great  water-worn boulders, they are hollowed out where waterfalls once fell.  They have the appearance of dry watercourses, exactly what any mountain  burns would be were the water-supply suddenly cut off for ever, the  climate altered from rainy to eternal sun-glare, and every plant and  tree blasted, never to grow again. Acting on the supposition that this  idea was a correct one, most observers have concluded that the climate  of Egypt in remote periods was very different from the dry, rainless one  now obtaining. To provide the water for the wadi streams, heavy  rainfall and forests are desiderated. They were easily supplied, on the  hypothesis. Forests clothed the mountain plateaus, heavy rains fell, and  the water rushed down to the Nile, carving out the great watercourses  which remain to this day, bearing testimony to the truth. And the  flints, which the Palaeolithic inhabitants of the plateau-forests made  and used, still lie on the now treeless and sun-baked desert surface.    [Illustration: 007.jpg THE BED OF AN ANCIENT WATERCOURSE IN THE WADIYEN,  THEBES.]    This is certainly a very weak conclusion. In fact, it seriously damages  the whole argument, the water-courses to the contrary notwithstanding.  The palaeoliths are there. They can be picked up by any visitor. There  they lie, great flints of the Drift types, just like those found in the  gravel-beds of England and Belgium, on the desert surface where they  were made. Undoubtedly where they were made, for the places where  they lie are the actual ancient flint workshops, where the flints were  chipped. Everywhere around are innumerable flint chips and perfect  weapons, burnt black and patinated by ages of sunlight. We are taking  one particular spot in the hills of Western Thebes as an example, but  there are plenty of others, such as the Wadi esh-Shekh on the right bank  of the Nile opposite Maghagha, whence Mr. H. Seton-Karr has brought  back specimens of flint tools of all ages from the Palaeolithic to the  Neolithic periods.    The Palaeolithic flint workshops on the Theban hills have been visited of  late years by Mr. Seton-Karr, by Prof. Schweinfurth, Mr. Allen Sturge,  and Dr. Blanckenhorn, by Mr. Portch, Mr. Ayrton, and Mr. Hall. The  weapons illustrated here were found by Messrs. Hall and Ayrton, and are  now preserved in the British Museum. Among these flints shown we notice  two fine specimens of the pear-shaped type of St. Acheul, with curious  adze-shaped implements of primitive type to left and right. Below, to  the right, is a very primitive instrument of Chellean type, being merely  a sharpened pebble. Above, to left and right, are two specimens of the  curious half-moon-shaped instruments which are characteristic of  the Theban flint field and are hardly known elsewhere. All have the  beautiful brown patina, which only ages of sunburn can give. The  \"poignard\" type to the left, at the bottom of the plate, is broken off  short.    [Illustration: 008.jpg Palaeolithic Implements of the Quaternary Period.  From the desert plateau and slopes west of Thebes.]    In the smaller illustration we see some remarkable types: two scrapers  or knives with strongly marked \"bulb of percussion\" (the spot where the  flint-knapper struck and from which the flakes flew off), a very regular  _coup-de-poing_ which looks almost like a large arrowhead, and on the  right a much weathered and patinated scraper which must be of immemorial  age.    [Illustration: 009.jpg (right): PALAEOLITHIC IMPLEMENTS. From Man,  March, 1905.]    This came from the top plateau, not from the slopes (or subsidiary  plateaus at the head of the _wadis_), as did the great St. Acheulian  weapons. The circular object is very remarkable: it is the half of the  ring of a \"morpholith \"(a round flinty accretion often found in the  Theban limestone) which has been split, and the split (flat) side  carefully bevelled. Several of these interesting objects have been  found in conjunction with Palaeolithic implements at Thebes. No doubt the  flints lie on the actual surface where they were made. No later water  action has swept them away and covered them with gravel, no later human  habitation has hidden them with successive deposits of soil, no gradual  deposit of dust and rubbish has buried them deep. They lie as they were  left in the far-away Palaeolithic Age, and they have lain there till  taken away by the modern explorer.    But this is not the case with all the Palaeolithic flints of Thebes. In  the year 1882 Maj.-Gen. Pitt-Rivers discovered Palaeolithic flints in the  deposit of diluvial detritus which lies between the cultivation and the  mountains on the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor. Many of these are  of the same type as those found on the surface of the mountain plateau  which lies at the head of the great _wadi_ of the Tombs of the Kings,  while the diluvial deposit is at its mouth. The stuff of which the  detritus is composed evidently came originally from the high plateau,  and was washed down, with the flints, in ancient times.    This is quite conceivable, but how is it that the flints left behind  on the plateau remain on the original ancient surface? How is it  conceivable that if (on the old theory) these plateaus were in  Palaeolithic days clothed with forest, the Palaeolithic flints could even  in a single instance remain undisturbed from Palaeolithic times to the  present day, when the forest in which they were made and the forest soil  on which they reposed have entirely disappeared? If there were woods and  forests On the heights, it would seem impossible that we should find,  as we do, Palaeolithic implements lying in situ on the desert surface,  around the actual manufactories where they were made. Yet if the  constant rainfall and the vegetation of the Libyan desert area in  Palaeolithic days is all a myth (as it most probably is), how came the  embedded palaeoliths, found by Gen. Pitt-Rivers, in the bed of diluvial  detritus which is apparently _debris_ from the plateau brought down by  the Palaeolithic _wadi_ streams?    Water erosion has certainly formed the Theban _wadis_. But this water  erosion was probably not that which would be the result of perennial  streams flowing down from wooded heights, but of torrents like those  of to-day, which fill the _wadis_ once in three years or so after heavy  rain, but repeated at much closer intervals. We may in fact suppose  just so much difference in meteorological conditions as would make it  possible for sudden rain-storms to occur over the desert at far more  frequent intervals than at present. That would account for the detritus  bed at the mouth of the _wadi_, and its embedded flints, and at the  same time maintain the general probability of the idea that the desert  plateaus were desert in Palaeolithic days as now, and that early man only  knapped his flints up there because he found the flint there. He himself  lived on the slopes and nearer the marsh.    This new view seems to be much sounder and more probable than the old  one, maintained by Flinders Petrie and Blanckenhorn, according to which  the high plateau was the home of man in Palaeolithic times, when the  rainfall, as shown by the valley erosion and waterfalls, must have  caused an abundant vegetation on the plateau, where man could live and  hunt his"]]]
