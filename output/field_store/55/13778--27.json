WRITING MATERIALS, ETC.      The Literature of ancient Egypt is the product of a period of about four  thousand years, and it was written in three kinds of writing, which are  called hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic. In the first of these the  characters were pictures of objects, in the second the forms of the  characters were made as simple as possible so that they might be written  quickly, and in the third many of them lost their picture form  altogether and became mere symbols. Egyptian writing was believed to  have been invented by the god Tehuti, or Thoth, and as this god was  thought to be a form of the mind and intellect and wisdom of the God who  created the heavens and the earth, the picture characters, or  hieroglyphs as they are called, were held to be holy, or divine, or  sacred. Certain religious texts were thought to possess special virtue  when written in hieroglyphs, and the chapters and sections of books that  were considered to have been composed by Thoth himself were believed to  possess very great power, and to be of the utmost benefit to the dead  when they were written out for them in hieroglyphs, and buried with them  in their coffins. Thoth also invented the science of numbers, and as he  fixed the courses of the sun, moon, and stars, and ordered the seasons,  he was thought to be the first astronomer. He was the lord of wisdom,  and the possessor of all knowledge, both heavenly and earthly, divine  and human; and he was the author of every attempt made by man to draw,  paint, and carve. As the lord and maker of books, and as the skilled  scribe, he was the clerk of the gods, and kept the registers wherein the  deeds of men were written down. The deep knowledge of Thoth enabled him  to find out the truth at all times, and this ability caused the  Egyptians to assign to him the position of Chief Judge of the dead. A  very ancient legend states that Thoth acted in this capacity in the  great trial that took place in heaven when Osiris was accused of certain  crimes by his twin-brother Set, the god of evil. Thoth examined the  evidence, and proved to the gods that the charges made by Set were  untrue, and that Osiris had spoken the truth and that Set was a liar.  For this reason every Egyptian prayed that Thoth might act for him as he  did for Osiris, and that on the day of the Great Judgment Thoth might  preside over the weighing of his heart in the Balance. All the important  religious works in all periods were believed to have been composed  either by himself, or by holy scribes who were inspired by him. They  were believed to be sources of the deepest wisdom, the like of which  existed in no other books in the world. And it is probably to these  books that Egypt owed her fame for learning and wisdom, which spread  throughout all the civilised world. The \"Books of Thoth,\" which late  popular tradition in Egypt declared to be as many as 36,525 in number,  were revered by both natives and foreigners in a way which it is  difficult for us in these days to realise. The scribes who studied and  copied these books were also specially honoured, for it was believed  that the spirit of Thoth, the twice-great and thrice-great god, dwelt in  them. The profession of the scribe was considered to be most honourable,  and its rewards were great, for no rank and no dignity were too high for  the educated scribe. Thoth appears in the papyri and on the monuments as  an ibis-headed man, and his companion is usually a dog-headed ape called  \"Asten.\" In the Hall of the Great Judgment he is seen holding in one  hand a reed with which he is writing on a palette the result of the  weighing of the heart of the dead man in the Balance. The gods accepted  the report of Thoth without question, and rewarded the good soul and  punished the bad according to his statement. From the beginning to the  end of the history of Egypt the position of Thoth as the \"righteous  judge,\" and framer of the laws by which heaven and earth, and men and  gods were governed, remained unchanged.    [Illustration: Thoth, the Scribe of the Gods.]    The substances used by the Egyptians for writing upon were very  numerous, but the commonest were stone of various kinds, wood, skin, and  papyrus. The earliest writings were probably traced upon these  substances with some fluid, coloured black or red, which served as ink.  When the Egyptians became acquainted with the use of the metals they  began to cut their writings in stone. The text of one of the oldest  chapters of the Book of the Dead (LXIV) is said in the Rubric to the  chapter to have been \"found\" cut upon a block of \"alabaster of the  south\" during the reign of Menkaura, a king of the fourth dynasty, about  3700 B.C. As time went on and men wanted to write long texts or  inscriptions, they made great use of wood as a writing material, partly  on account of the labour and expense of cutting in stone. In the British  Museum many wooden coffins may be seen with their insides covered with  religious texts, which were written with ink as on paper. Sheepskin, or  goatskin, was used as a writing material, but its use was never general;  ancient Egyptian documents written on skin or, as we should say, on  parchment, are very few. At a very early period the Egyptians learned  how to make a sort of paper, which is now universally known by the name  of \"papyrus.\" When they made this discovery cannot be said, but the  hieroglyphic inscriptions of the early dynasties contain the picture of  a roll of papyrus, and the antiquity of the use of papyrus must  therefore be very great. Among the oldest dated examples of inscribed  papyrus may be noted some accounts which were written in the reign of  King Assa (fourth dynasty, 3400 B.C.), and which were found at Sakkarah,  about 20 miles to the south of Cairo.    Papyrus was made from the papyrus plant that grew and flourished in the  swamps and marshes of Lower Egypt, and in the shallow pools that were  formed by the annual Nile flood. It no longer grows in Egypt, but it is  found in the swamps of the Egyptian Sudan, where it grows sometimes to  a height of 25 feet. The roots and the stem, which is often thicker than  a man's arm, are used as fuel, and the head, which is large and rounded,  is in some districts boiled and eaten as a vegetable. The Egyptian  variety of the papyrus plant was smaller than that found in the Sudan,  and the Egyptians made their paper from it by cutting the inner part of  the stem into thin strips, the width of which depended upon the  thickness of the stem; the length"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#2)"],[1," up to me, but left a clear space for the  frightened, crowding animals behind. The swiftest shot ahead to the  lead; the great herd lengthened out from its compact mass; swerved  easily to the left, as at a word of command; crashed through the  fringe of evergreen in which I had been hiding,--out into the open  again with a wild plunge and a loud cracking of hoofs, where they all  settled into their wonderful trot again, and kept on steadily across  the barren below.    That was the sight of a lifetime. One who saw it could never again  think of caribou as ungainly animals.    Megaleep belongs to the tribe of Ishmael. Indeed, his Latin name, as  well as his Indian one, signifies The Wanderer; and if you watch him a  little while you will understand perfectly why he is called so. The  first time I ever met him in summer, in strong contrast to the winter  herd, made his name clear in a moment. It was twilight on a wilderness  lake. I was sitting in my canoe by the inlet, wondering what kind of  bait to use for a big trout which lived in an eddy behind a rock, and  which disdained everything I offered him. The swallows were busy,  skimming low, and taking the young mosquitoes as they rose from the  water. One dipped to the surface near the eddy. As he came down I saw  a swift gleam in the depths below. He touched the water; there was a  swirl, a splash--and the swallow was gone. The trout had him.    Then a cow caribou came out of the woods onto the grassy point above  me to drink. First she wandered all over the point, making it look  afterwards as if a herd had passed. Then she took a sip of water by a  rock, crossed to my side of the point, and took a sip there; then to  the end of the point, and another sip; then back to the first place. A  nibble of grass, and she waded far out from shore to sip there; then  back, with a nod to a lily pad, and a sip nearer the brook. Finally  she meandered a long way up the shore out of sight, and when I picked  up the paddle to go, she came back again. Truly a _Wandergeist_ of the  woods, like the plover of the coast, who never knows what he wants,  nor why he circles about so, nor where he is going next.    If you follow the herds over the barrens and through the forest in  winter, you find the same wandering, unsatisfied creature. And if you  are a sportsman and a keen hunter, with well established ways of  trailing and stalking, you will be driven to desperation a score of  times before you get acquainted with Megaleep. He travels enormous  distances without any known object. His trail is everywhere; he is  himself nowhere. You scour the country for a week, crossing  innumerable trails, thinking the surrounding woods must be full of  caribou; then a man in a lumber camp, where you are overtaken by  night, tells you that he saw the herd you are after 'way down on the  Renous barrens, thirty miles below. You go there, and have the same  experience,--signs everywhere, old signs, new signs, but never a  caribou. And, ten to one, while you are there, the caribou are  sniffing your snowshoe track suspiciously back on the barrens that you  have just left.    Even in feeding, when you are hot on their trail and steal forward  expecting to see them every moment, it is the same exasperating story.  They dig a hole through four feet of packed snow to nibble the  reindeer lichen that grows everywhere on the barrens. Before it is  half eaten they wander off to the next barren and dig a larger hole;  then away to the woods for the gray-green hanging moss that grows on  the spruces. Here is a fallen tree half covered with the rich food.  Megaleep nibbles a bite or two, then wanders away and away in search  of another tree like the one he has just left.    And when you find him at last, the chances are still against you. You  are stealing forward cautiously when a fresh sign attracts attention.  You stop to examine it a moment. Something gray, dim, misty, seems to  drift like a cloud through the trees ahead. You scarcely notice it  till, on your right, a stir, and another cloud, and another--The  caribou, quick, a score of them! But before your rifle is up and you  have found the sights, the gray things melt into the gray woods and  drift away; and the stalk begins all over again.    The reason for this restlessness is not far to seek. Megaleep's  ancestors followed regular migrations in spring and autumn, like the  birds, on the unwooded plains beyond the Arctic Circle. Megaleep never  migrates; but the old instinct is in him and will not let him rest. So  he wanders through the year, and is never satisfied.    Fortunately nature has been kind to Megaleep in providing him with  means to gratify his wandering disposition. In winter, moose and red  deer must gather into yards and stay there. With the first heavy storm  of December, they gather in small bands here and there on the hardwood  ridges, and begin to make paths in the snow,--long, twisted, crooked  paths, running for miles in every direction, crossing and recrossing  in a tangle utterly hopeless to any head save that of a deer or moose.  These paths they keep tramped down and more or less open all winter,  so as to feed on the twigs and bark growing on either side. Were it  not for this curious provision, a single severe winter would leave  hardly a moose or a deer alive in the woods; for their hoofs are sharp  and sink deep, and with six feet of snow on a level they can scarcely  run half a mile outside their paths without becoming hopelessly  stalled or exhausted.    It is this great tangle of paths, by the way, which makes a deer or a  moose yard; and not the stupid hole in the snow which is pictured in  the geographies and most natural history books.    But Megaleep the Wanderer makes no such provision he depends upon  Mother Nature to take care of him. In summer he is brown, like the  great tree trunks among which he moves unseen. Then the frog of his  foot expands and grows spongy, so that he can cling to the  mountain-side like a goat, or move silently over the dead leaves. In  winter he becomes a soft gray, the better to fade into a snowstorm, or  to stand concealed in plain sight on the edges of the gray, desolate  barrens that he loves. Then the frog of his foot arches up out of the  way; the edges of his hoof grow sharp and shell-like, so that he can  travel over glare ice without slipping, and cut the crust to dig down  for the moss upon which he feeds. The hoofs, moreover, are very large  and deeply cleft, so as to spread widely when his weight is on them.  When you first find his track in the snow, you rub your eyes, thinking  that a huge ox must have passed that way. The dew-claws are also  large, and the ankle joint so flexible that it lets them down upon the  snow. So Megaleep has a kind of natural snowshoe with which he moves  easily over the crust, and, except in very deep, soft snows, wanders  at will, while other deer are prisoners in their yards. It is the  snapping of these loose hoofs and ankle joints that makes the merry  clacking sound as caribou run.    Sometimes, however, they overestimate their abilities, and their  wandering disposition brings them into trouble. Once I found a herd of  seven up to their backs in soft snow, and tired out,--a strange  condition for a caribou to be in. They were taking the affair  philosophically, resting till they should gather strength to flounder  to some spruce tops where moss was plenty. When I approached gently on  snowshoes (I had been hunting them diligently the week before to kill  them; but this put a different face on the matter) they gave a bound  or two, then settled deep in the snow, and turned their heads and said  with their great soft eyes: \"You have hunted us. Here we are, at your  mercy.\"    They were very much frightened at first; then I thought they grew a  bit curious, as I sat down peaceably in the snow to watch them. One--a  doe, more exhausted than the others, and famished--even nibbled a bit  of moss that I pushed near her with a stick. I had picked it with  gloves, so that the smell of my hand was not on it. After an hour or  so, if I moved softly, they let me approach quite up to them without  shaking their antlers or renewing their desperate attempts to flounder  away. But I did not touch them. That is a degradation which no wild  creature will permit when he is free; and I would not take advantage  of their helplessness.    Did they starve in the snow? you ask. Oh, no! I went to the place next  day and found that they had gained the spruce tops, ploughing through  the snow in great bounds, following the track of the strongest, which  went ahead to break the way. There they fed and rested, then went to  some dense thickets where they passed the night. In a day or two the  snow settled and hardened, and they took to their wandering again.    Later, in hunting, I crossed their tracks several times, and once I  saw them across a barren; but I left them undisturbed, to follow other  trails. We had eaten together; they had fed from my hand; and there  is no older truce on earth than that, not even in the unchanging East,  where it originated.    Megaleep in a storm is a most curious creature, the nearest thing to a  ghost to be found in the woods. More than other animals he feels the  falling barometer. His movements at such times drive you to  desperation, if you are following him; for he wanders unceasingly.  When the storm breaks he has a way of appearing suddenly, as if he  were seeking you, when by his trail you thought him miles ahead. And  the way he disappears--just melts into the thick driving flakes and  the shrouded trees--is most uncanny. Six or seven caribou once played  hide-and-seek with me that way, giving me vague glimpses here and  there, drawing near to get my scent, yet keeping me looking up wind  into the driving snow where I could see nothing distinctly. And all  the while they drifted about like so many huge flakes of"]]]
