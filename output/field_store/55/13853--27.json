In the reign of _Philip I._, William, Duke of Normandy,  obtained the kingdom of England, and thus became far more powerful than  his suzerain, the King of France, a weak man of vicious habits, who lay  for many years of his life under sentence of excommunication for an  adulterous marriage with Bertrade de Montfort, Countess of Anjou. The  power of the king and of the law was probably at the very lowest ebb  during the time of Philip I., though minds and manners were less debased  than in the former century.      5. The First Crusade (1095--1100).--Pilgrimage to the Holy Land had  now become one great means by which the men of the West sought pardon  for their sins. Jerusalem had long been held by the Arabs, who had  treated the pilgrims well; but these had been conquered by a fierce  Turcoman tribe, who robbed and oppressed the pilgrims. Peter the Hermit,  returning from a pilgrimage, persuaded Pope Urban II. that it would be  well to stir up Christendom to drive back the Moslem power, and deliver  Jerusalem and the holy places. Urban II. accordingly, when holding a  council at Clermont, in Auvergne, permitted Peter to describe in glowing  words the miseries of pilgrims and the profanation of the holy places.  Cries broke out, \"God wills it!\" and multitudes thronged to receive  crosses cut out in cloth, which were fastened to the shoulder, and  pledged the wearer to the holy war or crusade, as it was called. Philip  I. took no interest in the cause, but his brother Hugh, Count of  Vermandois, Stephen, Count of Blois, Robert, Duke of Normandy, and  Raymond, Count of Toulouse, joined the expedition, which was made under  Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine, or what we now call the  Netherlands. The crusade proved successful; Jerusalem was gained, and a  kingdom of detached cities and forts was founded in Palestine, of which  Godfrey became the first king. The whole of the West was supposed to  keep up the defence of the Holy Land, but, in fact, most of those who  went as armed pilgrims were either French, Normans, or Aquitanians; and  the men of the East called all alike Franks. Two orders of monks, who  were also knights, became the permanent defenders of the kingdom--the  Knights of St. John, also called Hospitallers, because they also lodged  pilgrims and tended the sick; and the Knights Templars. Both had  establishments in different countries in Europe, where youths were  trained to the rules of their order. The old custom of solemnly girding  a young warrior with his sword was developing into a system by which the  nobly born man was trained through the ranks of page and squire to full  knighthood, and made to take vows which bound him to honourable customs  to equals, though, unhappily, no account was taken of his inferiors.      6. Louis VI. and VII.--Philip's son, _Louis VI., or the Fat_, was the  first able man whom the line of Hugh Capet had produced since it mounted  the throne. He made the first attempt at curbing the nobles, assisted by  Suger, the Abbot of St. Denys. The only possibility of doing this was to  obtain the aid of one party of nobles against another; and when any  unusually flagrant offence had been committed, Louis called together the  nobles, bishops, and abbots of his domain, and obtained their consent  and assistance in making war on the guilty man, and overthrowing his  castle, thus, in some degree, lessening the sense of utter impunity  which had caused so many violences and such savage recklessness. He also  permitted a few of the cities to purchase the right of self-government,  and freedom from the ill usage of the counts, who, from their guardians,  had become their tyrants; but in this he seems not to have been so much  guided by any fixed principle, as by his private interests and feelings  towards the individual city or lord in question. However, the royal  authority had begun to be respected by 1137, when Louis VI. died, having  just effected the marriage of his son, _Louis VII._, with Eleanor, the  heiress of the Dukes of Aquitaine--thus hoping to make the crown really  more powerful than the great princes who owed it homage. At this time  lived the great St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, who had a wonderful  influence over men's minds. It was a time of much thought and  speculation, and Peter Abailard, an able student of the Paris  University, held a controversy with Bernard, in which we see the first  struggle between intellect and authority. Bernard roused the young king,  Louis VII., to go on the second crusade, which was undertaken by the  Emperor and the other princes of Europe to relieve the distress of the  kingdom of Palestine. France had no navy, so the war was by land,  through the rugged hills of Asia Minor, where the army was almost  destroyed by the Saracens. Though Louis did reach Palestine, it was with  weakened forces; he could effect nothing by his campaign, and Eleanor,  who had accompanied him, seems to have been entirely corrupted by the  evil habits of the Franks settled in the East. Soon after his return,  Louis dissolved his marriage; and Eleanor became the wife of Henry,  Count of Anjou, who soon after inherited the kingdom of England as our  Henry II., as well as the duchy of Normandy, and betrothed his third son  to the heiress of Brittany. Eleanor's marriage seemed to undo all that  Louis VI. had done in raising the royal power; for Henry completely  overshadowed Louis, whose only resource was in feeble endeavours to take  part against him in his many family quarrels. The whole reign of Louis  the Young, the title that adhered to him on account of his simple,  childish nature, is only a record of weakness and disaster, till he died  in 1180. What life went on in France, went on principally in the south.  The lands of Aquitaine and Provence had never dropped the old classical  love of poetry and art. A softer form of broken Latin was then spoken,  and the art of minstrelsy was frequent among all ranks. Poets were  called troubadours and _trouveres_ (finders). Courts of love were held,  where there were competitions in poetry, the prize being a golden  violet; and many of the bravest warriors were also distinguished  troubadours--among them the elder sons of Queen Eleanor. There was much  license of manners, much turbulence; and as the Aquitanians hated  Angevin rule, the troubadours never ceased to stir up the sons of Henry  II. against him.      7. Philip II. (1180--1223).--Powerful in fact as Henry II. was, it was  his gathering so large a part of France under his rule which was, in the  end, to build up the greatness of the French kings. What had held them  in check was the existence of the great fiefs or provinces, each with  its own line of dukes or counts, and all practically independent of the  king. But now nearly all the provinces of southern and western France  were gathered into the hand of a single ruler; and though he was a  Frenchman in blood, yet, as he was King of England, this ruler seemed to  his French subjects no Frenchman, but a foreigner. They began therefore  to look to the French king to free them from a foreign ruler; and the  son of Louis VII., called _Philip Augustus_, was ready to take advantage  of their disposition. Philip was a really able man, making up by address  for want of personal courage. He set himself to lower the power of the  house of Anjou and increase that of the house of Paris. As a boy he had  watched conferences between his father and Henry under the great elm of  Gisors, on the borders of Normandy, and seeing his father overreached,  he laid up a store of hatred to the rival king. As soon as he had the  power, he cut down the elm, which was so large that 300 horsemen could  be sheltered under its branches. He supported the sons of Henry II. in  their rebellions, and was always the bitter foe of the head of the  family. Philip assumed the cross in 1187, on the tidings of the loss of  Jerusalem, and in 1190 joined Richard I. of England at Messina, where  they wintered, and then sailed for St. Jean d'Acre. After this city was  taken, Philip returned to France, where he continued to profit by the  crimes and dissensions of the Angevins, and gained, both as their enemy  and as King of France. When Richard's successor, John, murdered Arthur,  the heir of the dukedom of Brittany and claimant of both Anjou and  Normandy, Philip took advantage of the general indignation to hold a  court of peers, in which John, on his non-appearance, was adjudged to  have forfeited his fiefs. In the war which followed and ended in 1204,  Philip not only gained the great Norman dukedom, which gave him the  command of Rouen and of the mouth of the Seine, as well as Anjou, Maine,  and Poitou, the countries which held the Loire in their power, but  established the precedent that a crown vassal was amenable to justice,  and might be made to forfeit his lands. What he had won by the sword he  held by wisdom and good government. Seeing that the cities were capable  of being made to balance the power of the nobles, he granted them  privileges which caused him to be esteemed their best friend, and he  promoted all improvements. Though once laid under an interdict by Pope  Innocent III. for an unlawful marriage, Philip usually followed the  policy which gained for the Kings of France the title of \"Most Christian  King.\" The real meaning of this was that he should always support the  Pope against the Emperor, and in return be allowed more than ordinary  power over his clergy. The great feudal vassals of eastern France, with  a strong instinct that he was their enemy, made a league with the  Emperor Otto IV. and his uncle King John, against Philip Augustus. John  attacked him in the south, and was repulsed by Philip's son, Louis,  called the \"Lion;\" while the king himself, backed by the burghers of his  chief cities, gained at Bouvines, over Otto, the first real French  victory, in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17289"],[0,"The Dance (by An Antiquary) (#2)"],[1,"ootnote: There is a picture of an Egyptian gauffering machine  in Wilkinson, vol. i., p. 185.] Some danced in pairs, holding each  other's hand; others went through a succession of steps alone, both  men and women; sometimes a man performed a solo to the sound of music  or the clapping of hands.    \"A favourite figure dance was universally adopted throughout the  country, in which two partners, who were usually men, advanced toward  each other, or stood face to face upon one leg, and having performed a  series of movements, retired again in opposite directions, continuing  to hold by one hand and concluding by turning each other round (see  fig. 3). That the attitude was very common is proved by its having  been adopted by the hieroglyphic (fig. 4) as the mode of describing  'dance.'\"    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--The hieroglyphics describe the dance.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Egyptian hieroglyphic for \"dance.\"]    Many of the positions of the dance illustrated in Gardner Wilkinson  are used at the present day.    The ASSYRIANS probably danced as much as the other nations, but  amongst the many monuments that have been discovered there is little  dancing shown, and they were evidently more proud of their campaigns  and their hunting than of their dancing. A stern and strong people,  although they undoubtedly had this amusement, we know little about it.  Of the Phoenicians, their neighbours, we have some illustrations of  their dance, which was apparently of a serious nature, judging by the  examples which we possess, such as that (fig. 5) from Cyprus  representing three figures in hooded cowls dancing around a piper. It  is a dance around a centre, as is also (fig. 6) that from Idalium in  Cyprus. The latter is engraved around a bronze bowl and is evidently a  planet and sun dance before a goddess, in a temple; the sun being the  central object around which they dance, accompanied by the double  pipes, the harp, and tabour. The Egyptian origin of the devotion is  apparent in the details, especially in the lotus-smelling goddess  (marked A on fig. 6) who holds the flower in the manner shown in an  Egyptian painting in the British Museum (fig. 7).    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Cyprian limestone group of Phoenician dancers,  about 6-1/2 in. high. There is a somewhat similar group, also from  Cyprus, in the British Museum. The dress, a hooded cowl, appears to be  of great antiquity.]    From the Phoenicians we have illustrated examples, but no record,  whereas from their neighbours the Hebrews we have ample records in the  Scriptures, but no illustrations. It is, however, most probable that  the dance with them had the traditional character of the nations  around them or who had held them captive, and the Philistine dance  (fig. 6) may have been of the same kind as that around the golden calf  (Apis) of the desert (Exodus xxxii. v. 19).    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Phoenician patera, from Idalium, showing a  religious ritual dance before a goddess in a temple round a sun  emblem.]    When they passed the Red Sea, Miriam and the maidens danced in chorus  with singing and the beating of the timbrel (tambour). (Exodus xv. v.  1.)    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Female figure smelling a lotus. From a  painting in the British Museum.]    King David not only danced before the ark (2 Samuel vi. v. 16), but  mentions dancing in the 149th and 150th Psalm. Certain historians also  tell us that they had dancing in their ritual of the seasons. Their  dancing seems to have been associated with joy, as we read of \"a time  to mourn and a time to dance\"; we find (Eccles. iii. v. 4) they had  also the pipes: \"We have piped to you and you have not danced\"  (Matthew xi. v. 17). These dances were evidently executed by the  peoples themselves, and not by public performers.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Dance of Bacchantes, painted by the ceramic  painter, Hieron. (British Museum,)]          CHAPTER II.      DANCING WITH THE GREEKS.    With the Greeks, dancing certainly was primarily part of a religious  rite; with music it formed the lyric art. The term, however, with them  included all those actions of the body and limbs, and all expressions  and actions of the features and head which suggest ideas; marching,  acrobatic performances, and mimetic action all came into the term.    According to the historians, the Greeks attributed dancing to their  deities: Homer makes Apollo _orchestes_, or the dancer; and amongst  the early dances is that in his honour called the _Hyporchema_. Their  dances may be divided into sections somewhat thus: (1) those of a  religious species, (2) those of a gymnastic nature, (3) those of a  mimetic character, (4) those of the theatre, such as the chorus, (5)  those partly social, partly religious dances, such as the hymeneal,  and (6) chamber dances.    Grown up men and women did not dance together, but the youth of both  sexes joined in the _Horm[)o]s_ or chain dance and the  _G[)e]r[)a]n[)o]s_, or crane (see fig. 11).    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Dancing Bacchante. From a vase in the British  Museum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Greek terra cotta dancing girl, about 350  B.C. (British Museum.)]    According to some authorities, one of the most primitive of the first  class, attributed to Phrygian origin, was the _Aloenes_, danced to the  Phrygian flute by the priests of Cybele in honour of her daughter  Ceres. The dances ultimately celebrated in her cult were numerous:  such as the _Anthema_, the _Bookolos_, the _Epicredros_, and many  others, some rustic for labourers, others of shepherds, etc. Every  locality seems to have had a dance of its own. Dances in honour of  Venus were common, she was the patroness of proper and decent dancing;  on the contrary, those in honour of Dionysius or Bacchus degenerated  into revelry and obscenity. The _Epilenios_ danced when the grapes  were pressed, and imitated the gathering and pressing. The  _Anteisterios_ danced when the wine was vatted (figs. 8, 9, 10), and  the _Bahilicos_, danced to the sistrus, cymbals, and tambour, often  degenerated into orgies.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--The G[)e]r[)a]n[)o]s from  a vase in the Museo Borbonico, Naples.]    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Panathenaeac dance, about  the 4th century B.C.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--A military dance, supposed  to be the _Corybantum_. From a Greek bas-relief in the Vatican  Museum.]    The _G[)e]r[)a]n[)o]s_, originally from Delos, is said to have been  originated by Theseus in memory of his escape from the labyrinth of  Crete (fig. 12). It was a hand-in-hand dance alternately of males and  females. The dance was led by the representative of Theseus playing  the lyre.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Greek dancer with castanets. (British  Museum.) See also Castanet dance by Myron, fig. 63a.]    Of the second class, the gymnastic, the most important were military  dances, the invention of which was attributed to Minerva; of these the  _Corybantum_ was the most remarkable. It was of Phrygian origin and of  a mixed religious, military, and mimetic character; the performers  were armed, and bounded about, springing and clashing their arms and  shields to imitate the Corybantes endeavouring to stifle the cries of  the infant Zeus, in Crete. The Pyrrhic (fig. 13), a war dance of Doric  origin, was a rapid dance to the double flute, and made to resemble  an action in battle; the _Hoplites_ of Homer is thought to have been  of this kind. The Dorians were very partial to this dance and  considered their success in battle due to the celerity and training of  the dance. In subsequent periods it was imitated by female dancers and  as a _pas seul_. It was also performed in the Panathenaea by Ephebi at  the expense of the Choragus, but this was probably only a mimetic  performance and not warlike.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cymbals (about 4 in.) and double flute.  (British Museum.)]    There were many other heroic military dances in honour of Hercules,  Theseus, etc.    The chorus, composed of singers and dancers, formed part of the drama,  which included the recitation of some poetic composition, and included  gesticulative and mimetic action as well as dancing and singing. The  Dorians were especially fond of this; their poetry was generally  choral, and the Doric forms were preserved by the Athenians in the  choral compositions of their drama.    The tragic dance, _Emmelia_, was solemn; whilst that in comedy,  _Cordax_, was frivolous, and the _siccinis_, or dance of Satyrs, was  often obscene. They danced to the music of the pipes, the tambour, the  harp, castanets, cymbals, etc. (figs. 14, 15, 16).    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Greek dancers. From a vase in the Hamilton  Collection.] [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Bacchanalian dancer. Vase from  Nocera, Museum, Naples.]    In the rites of Dionysius the chorus was fifty and the cithara was  used instead of the flute. From the time of Sophocles it was fifteen,  and always had a professed trainer. The choric question is, however, a  subject in itself, and cannot be fairly dealt with here.  The social  dances, and those in honour of the seasons, fire and water, were  numerous and generally local; whilst the chamber dances, professional  dancing, the throwing of the _Kotabos_, and such-like, must be left to  the reader's further study of the authors mentioned in the  bibliography at the end of the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Greek dancers and tumblers.]    It may astonish the reader to know that the funambulist or rope-dancer  was very expert with the Greeks, as also was the acrobat between  knives and swords. Animals were also taught to dance on ropes, even  elephants.    The important religious and other dances were not generally composed  of professionals. The greatest men were not above showing their  sentiments by dancing. Sophocles danced after Salamis, and Epaminondas  was an expert dancer. There were dancers of all grades, from the  distinguished to the moderate."]]]
