Now,  take the dough between the hands and stretch out, knocking it against  the moulding board, fold in the ends and shape into loaves. Place  in well-greased pans and brush the top of each loaf with shortening.  Cover and let raise for 45 minutes. Bake in a hot oven for 45 minutes  and brush with shortening when removing from the oven. Let cool and  then the bread is ready to use.      SPONGE METHOD    Generally speaking, the sponge method produces a lighter and whiter  loaf than the bread made by the straight dough method. Bread made by  the straight dough method has the advantage over bread made by the  sponge method in flavor, texture and keeping qualities.      SPONGE METHOD      One quart of water or half water and half milk, 80 degrees            Fahrenheit.    Two yeast cakes,    Two and one-half quarts or two and one-half pounds of flour,    One ounce of sugar.    Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water and add the flour. Beat to  thoroughly blend and then set aside to raise for three hours, then add      One ounce of salt,    One and one-half ounces of shortening,    One and one-half quarts or one and one-half pounds of flour.    Work to a smooth elastic dough. This takes usually about ten minutes,  after the flour is worked into the dough. Place in a greased bowl  and then turn over the dough to coat with shortening. This prevents a  crust from forming on the dough. Set aside to raise for two hours and  then pull the sides down to the centre of the dough and punch down.  Turn the dough over and let raise for one and one-quarter hours.      THE CARE OF THE BREAD AFTER BAKING    The jar, crock or box in which the bread is kept should be  scrupulously clean. It should be scalded and aired one day every week  in winter and three times weekly during the spring, summer and early  fall. Keep the fact in mind that the bread kept in a poorly ventilated  box will mould and spoil and thus be unfit for food.    Place the freshly baked bread on a wire rack to thoroughly cool before  storing. Do not put old bread in the box with the new baking. Plan to  use the stale bread for toast, dressings, bread and cabinet puddings,  croutons and crumbs.      THE FOOD VALUE OF BREAD    Wheat contains the sixteen needed elements for nutrition, and when  made into palatable bread, it forms about 40 per cent. of our total  food requirements. Stale bread digests much easier than fresh bread  for the reason that when thoroughly masticated in the mouth the saliva  acts directly upon the starchy content. Fresh bread, unless thoroughly  chewed, so that it may be well broken up, becomes a hard, pasty  ball in the stomach, which requires that organ to manufacture the  additional gastric juices to break up this dough ball.    Bread from one to three days old easily digests. Graham and whole  wheat breads contain a larger percentage of nutriment than the white  breads.      OVEN TEMPERATURE    Many housewives feel that it is impossible to secure accurate results  in baking in the gas range; this is due to the fact that few women  really understand the principle of baking with gas.    To secure a slow oven, light both burners and let them burn for five  minutes; then turn both of them down low, turning the handle that  controls the flow of gas two-thirds off. This will maintain a steady  even heat. A slow oven requires 250 to 275 degrees Fahrenheit of heat.  A moderate oven is 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit of heat. It can be  obtained by burning both burners of gas range for eight minutes and  then turning them down one-half to maintain this heat.    A hot oven requires 425 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and will need  to have the burners burning twelve minutes and then turned off  one-quarter.    This heat is intense and entirely too hot for breads, pastries and  cakes. Meats require this heat for one-half of the length of time  in the period of cooking. This heat is also necessary for broiling,  grilling, etc.    Now, also try to utilize the full oven space when baking by cooking  two or more dishes at the same time. Vegetables may be placed in  casseroles or earthen dishes or even ordinary saucepans; cover them  closely and cook in the oven until tender. This will not injure other  foods baking in the oven.    Do not place breads, cakes and pastries upon the top shelf; rather,  place them on the lower shelf and cook in moderate oven. Do you know  that there are still among us women who firmly believe that placing  other foods to cook in oven with cake will surely spoil it? This is a  mistake; utilize every bit of oven space.    An oven thermometer soon pays for itself. Pay strict attention to  heating the oven; if the oven is too hot, the heat is wasted, while it  cools sufficiently. This wastes gas. When food is first placed in the  oven, keep oven door closed for first ten minutes and then open when  necessary.    Placing food in oven will materially reduce the heat. Do not try to  increase the heat; just as soon as the mixture acquires the heat, the  baking will begin in the usual manner and the dish will be ready to  remove from oven in given time.    Never keep the oven waiting for the food; rather let food remain in  cool place while oven is heating.    Before mixing materials select the pans that will best fit the oven.  This does not mean that you must discard your present equipment. It  means that you should place in groups such pans that entirely fill  oven space without crowding. Keep this fact in mind when purchasing  new utensils.    The best and whitest rye flour is milled from the centre of the grains  in a manner similar to wheat flour. When only the bran is removed from  the milling, we have the darker flour, carrying a heavy pronounced  flavor. The rye meal is used for making pumpernickel, a Swiss and  Swedish rye flour bread.      HOME-MADE YEAST    Wash four potatoes and then cut in slices, without peeling, and place  in saucepan, and add three pints of water. Cook until the potatoes are  soft and then add      One-half cupful of hops.    Cook slowly for one-half hour. Rub the mixture through a fine sieve  and then pour hot mixture on      One and one-half cupfuls of flour,    One tablespoonful of salt,    One-quarter cupful of brown sugar.    Stir until well mixed, beating free from lumps. Cool to 80 degrees  Fahrenheit. Now add      One yeast cake dissolved in one cupful of water, 80 degrees            Fahrenheit    Stir well to mix and then let ferment in a warm place for ten hours.  Now pour into jar or crock and store in a cool place.      TO USE    Use one and one-half cups of this mixture in place of the yeast cake.  Always stir well before using and take care that the mixture does not  freeze. This potato ferment must be made fresh every eighteen days in  winter and every twelve days in summer.      STRAIGHT DOUGH VIENNA      One quart of water or milk,    One ounce of salt,    One ounce of sugar.    Stir well to thoroughly dissolve, and then add      Two yeast cakes,    Four quarts of flour,    One and one-half ounces of shortening.    Work to a smooth dough and then knead for ten minutes. Then place in  a well-greased bowl, turning the dough over to thoroughly coat. This  prevents a crust from forming on the dough.    Cover the bowl and set aside to raise for three and one-half hours.  Now lay over the dough by pulling in toward the centre, the sides and  ends of the dough until it forms a compact mass. Turn over the dough,  cover and let rise for one hour. Now place on the moulding board and  proceed to form into loaves, using the same method as in the sponge  dough.      TO PREPARE LOAF    When the dough is ready to mould into loaves, proceed; using method as  given in sponge dough, finally rolling the loaf on the moulding board,  making it pointed at the ends. Now place a clean cloth in a deep  baking pan and sprinkle the cloth with cornmeal. Place the loaf of  dough on the cloth and sprinkle it lightly with cornmeal. Now lift  the cloth up close to the dough, making a cloth partition between each  loaf.    Let the dough rise, about 45 minutes, and when ready to bake, lift  dough carefully from the cloth and lay on a baking sheet and gash  slightly with a sharp knife. Wash with an egg and water, wash and back  forty-five minutes in a hot oven, adding a small saucepan of boiling  water to provide steam to keep the loaf moist while baking.    One-half of above recipes for small family.      TO MAKE THE FAMOUS FRENCH BREAD    Pare and cut in slices two medium-sized potatoes. Cook until very  soft in three cups of water. When cooked rub through a sieve and cool.  There must be two cups of this mixture. When the mixture is about 80  degrees Fahrenheit, pour in the mixing bowl and add      One yeast cake crumbled in,    One-half ounce of shortening (1 tablespoon),    One ounce of sugar (2 tablespoons),    Three-fourths ounce of salt (2 teaspoons).    Stir to thoroughly dissolve and then add eight cups of flour. Work  to a dough and then proceed as in the straight dough method. When the  dough is ready for the pans, cut or divide into six pieces and mould  into loaves, three inches thick and twelve inches long, and set to  rise like the Vienna bread, then bake, using the same method.      RYE BREAD      Two cupfuls of water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,    Two tablespoonfuls of sugar,    Two teaspoonfuls of salt.    Mix and then add      One yeast cake,    Five cupfuls of white flour,    Three cupfuls of rye flour,    Two tablespoonfuls of shortening.    Work to a dough and ferment three and one-quarter hours, then proceed  as in the straight dough method. When the dough is ready for the pans  use the same method as for Vienna bread. Bake in a similar manner,  having the oven heated to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Rye bread requires  an oven hotter than for wheat bread. Wash the rye bread when taking  from the oven with warm water.
