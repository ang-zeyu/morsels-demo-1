And because many  seek knowledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray,  and bear little or no fruit.    5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice  and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain  questionings: there had not been so many evil doings and  stumbling-blocks among the laity, nor such ill living among  houses of religion.  Of a surety, at the Day of Judgment it will  be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have done;  not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.  Tell  me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou  knewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in  learning?  Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps  never have one thought concerning them.  Whilst they lived they  seemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.    6. Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away!  Would  that their life and knowledge had agreed together!  For then  would they have read and inquired unto good purpose.  How many  perish through empty learning in this world, who care little for  serving God.  And because they love to be great more than to be  humble, therefore they \"have become vain in their imaginations.\"  He only is truly great, who hath great charity.  He is truly  great who deemeth himself small, and counteth all height of  honour as nothing.  He is the truly wise man, who counteth all  earthly things as dung that he may win Christ.  And he is the  truly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his  own will.    (1) Psalm xciv. 12; Numbers xii. 8.   (2) John viii. 25 (Vulg.).      CHAPTER IV    Of prudence in action    We must not trust every word of others or feeling within  ourselves, but cautiously and patiently try the matter, whether  it be of God.  Unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier to  believe and speak evil of others, rather than good.  But they  that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer,  for they know man's weakness that it is prone to evil and  unstable in words.    2. This is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn  in our own opinions.  A part of this wisdom also is not to  believe every word we hear, nor to tell others all that we hear,  even though we believe it.  Take counsel with a man who is wise  and of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by one better  than thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions.  A good  life maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in  many things.  The more humble a man is in himself, and the more  obedient towards God, the wiser will he be in all things, and the  more shall his soul be at peace.      CHAPTER V    Of the reading of Holy Scriptures    It is Truth which we must look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of  words.  All Scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it  was written.  We must rather seek for what is profitable in  Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse.  Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple,  as well as those which are deep and difficult.  And let not the  weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be  of little or much learning, but let the love of the pure Truth  draw thee to read.  Ask not, who hath said this or that, but look  to what he says.    2. Men pass away, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.  Without respect of persons God speaketh to us in divers manners.  Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading of holy  writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should  pass simply on.  If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read  humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring to win a character for  learning.  Ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men;  nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou, for  they are not uttered without cause.      CHAPTER VI    Of inordinate affections    Whensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he  becometh restless.  The proud and the avaricious man are never  at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the  multitude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self,  is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters.  It is hard for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part  carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense, to withdraw  himself altogether from earthly desires.  And therefore, when he  withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily  angered too if any oppose his will.    2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination,  immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his  conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in  no way attained the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of  heart is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it.  And therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is  carnal, nor in him who is given up to the things that are without  him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and living the  life of the Spirit.      CHAPTER VII    Of fleeing from vain hope and pride    Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in  any created Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others  for the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this  life.  Rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in God.  Do what  lieth in thy power, and God will help thy good intent. Trust not  in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives, but  rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and  giveth grace to the humble.    2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them, nor in thy  friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all things,  and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself.  Be  not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with  only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain  of thy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from  whom cometh every good gift which we have.    3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou  appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  Be  not proud of thy good works, for God's judgments are of another  sort than the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes  displeasing to Him.  If thou hast any good, believe that others  have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy humility. It is no  harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but it is  great harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Peace is ever  with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is  envy and continual wrath.      CHAPTER VIII    Of the danger of too much familiarity    Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise  and feareth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers.  Be  not a flatterer of the rich; nor willingly seek the society of  the great.  Let thy company be the humble and the simple, the  devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning things  which edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good  women alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His  Angels only, and flee from the notice of men.    2. We must love all men, but not make close companions of all.  It sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us is highly  regarded through good report of him, whose actual person is  nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes  think to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease  them the more by the faultiness of character which they perceive  in us.      CHAPTER IX    Of obedience and subjection    It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under  authority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it to  live in subjection than in a place of authority.  Many are in  obedience from necessity rather than from love; these take it  amiss, and repine for small cause.  Nor will they gain freedom of  spirit, unless with all their heart they submit themselves for  the love of God.  Though thou run hither and thither, thou wilt  not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him  who is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them  have deceived many.    2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent,  and is the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if  Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes  yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace.  Who is so wise  as to have perfect knowledge of all things?  Therefore trust not  too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the  opinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for  the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another,  thou shalt the more profit thereby.    3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to hearken and to  receive counsel than to give it.  It may also come to pass that  each opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when  reason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or  wilfulness.      CHAPTER X    Of the danger of superfluity of words    Avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of men; for talk concerning  worldly things, though it be innocently undertaken, is a  hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity.  Many a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone  amongst men.  But why do we talk and gossip so continually,  seeing that we so rarely resume our silence without some hurt  done to our conscience?  We like talking so much because we hope  by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and because we  seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts.  And  we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or  desire, or else of those which we most dislike.    2. But alas! it is often to no purpose and in vain.  For this  outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#2)"],[1,"ice's moral character was disreputable; but he was a  man of energy, and he set to work at once to rebuild his cathedral,  and succeeded in getting from the king abundance of stone for the  purpose, some of it from the remains of the Palatine tower by the side  of the Fleet River, which was just being pulled down, having been  hopelessly damaged by the fire[1], and some direct from Caen. William  also at the same time gave him the manor and castle of Bishop  Stortford, thus making him a baronial noble. There was need for haste,  for the Conqueror died at Rouen on the 9th of September that same  year.    So began the great Cathedral of St. Paul, the finest in England in its  time, which, witnessing heavy calamities, brilliant successes,  scenes both glorious and sad, changes--some improvements and others  debasements--lasted on for nearly six centuries, and then was  destroyed in the Great Fire. We have first to note the main features  of the architectural history.    Bishop Maurice began in the Norman style, as did all the  cathedral-builders of that age, and splendid examples of their work  are still to be seen in our cities. Bishop Maurice's, as I have said,  was the finest of them all in its inception, but he really did little  more than design it and lay the foundations, though he lived until  1108. He seems to have been too fond of his money. His successor,  Richard Belmeis, exerted himself very heartily at the beginning of his  episcopate, spent large sums on the cathedral, and cleared away an  area of mean buildings in the churchyard, around which his predecessor  had built a wall. In this work King Henry I. assisted him generously;  gave him stone, and commanded that all material brought up the River  Fleet for the cathedral should be free from toll; gave him moreover  all the fish caught within the cathedral neighbourhood, and a tithe  of all the venison taken in the County of Essex. These last boons may  have arisen from the economical and abstemious life which the bishop  lived, in order to devote his income to the cathedral building.    Belmeis also gave a site for St. Paul's School; but though he, like  his predecessor, occupied the see for twenty years, he did not see the  completion of the cathedral. He seems to have been embittered because  he failed in attaining what his soul longed for--the removal of the  Primatial chair from Canterbury to London. Anselm, not unreasonably,  pronounced the attempt an audacious act of usurpation. Belmeis's  health broke down. He was attacked with creeping paralysis, and sadly  withdrew himself from active work, devoting himself to the foundation  of the monastery of St. Osyth, in Essex. There, after lingering four  years, he died, and there he lies buried.    King Henry I. died nearly at the same time, and as there was a contest  for the throne ensuing on his death, so was there for the bishopric  of London. In the interval, Henry de Blois, the famous Bishop of  Winchester, was appointed to administer the affairs of St. Paul's, and  almost immediately he had to deal with a calamity. Another great fire  broke out at London Bridge in 1135, and did damage more or less all  the way to St. Clement Danes. Matthew Paris speaks of St. Paul's as  having been destroyed. This was certainly not the case, but serious  injury was done, and the progress of the building was greatly delayed.  Bishop Henry called on his people of Winchester to help in the  rebuilding, putting forward the plea that though St. Paul was the  great Apostle of the West, and had planted so many churches, this was  the only cathedral dedicated to him. During these years Architecture  was ever on the change, and, as was always the custom, the builders in  any given case did not trouble themselves to follow the style in which  a work had been begun, but went on with whatever was in use then.    Consequently the heavy Norman passed into Transitional, and Early  English. For heavy columns clustered pillars were substituted, and  lancets for round arches. Nevertheless, apparently, Norman columns  which remained firm were left alone, while pointed arches were placed  over them in the triforium. Even in the Early English clustered  pillars there were differences marking different dates, some of the  time of the Transition (1222), and some thirty years later. And  here let us note that the \"Gothic\" church, as it is shown in our  illustrations, does not indicate that the Norman work had been  replaced by it. The clustered pillars really encased the Norman, as  they have done in other cathedrals similarly treated. At Winchester,  William of Wykeham cut the massive Norman into Perpendicular order,  but at St. Paul's an outer encasement covered the Norman, as Wren  showed when he wrote his account of the ruined church. A steeple was  erected in 1221. There was a great ceremony at the rededication, by  Bishop Roger Niger, in 1240, the Archbishop of Canterbury and six  other bishops assisting.    In 1255 it became necessary for the Bishop of London (Fulk Basset) to  put forth appeals for the repair of the cathedral, and his ground  of appeal was that the church had in time past been so shattered by  tempests that the roof was dangerous. Some notes about these tempests  will be found in a subsequent page. Accordingly this part was renewed,  and at the same time the cathedral church was lengthened out eastward.  There had been a parish church of St. Faith at the east end, which  was now brought within the cathedral. The parishioners were not well  content with this, so the east end of the crypt was allotted to them  as their parish church, and they were also allowed to keep a detached  tower with a peal of bells east of the church. This tower had already  an historic interest, for it had pealed forth the summons to the  Folkmote in early days, when that was held at the top of Cheapside.  This eastward addition was known all through the after years as \"The  New Work.\" It is remarkable to note how much assistance came from  outside. Hortatory letters were sent from the Archbishops of  Canterbury and York, as well as from the greater number of other  bishops, to their respective dioceses. And not only so, but eight  Irish dioceses and one Scotch (Brechin) also sent aid.    There was another parish church hard by, that of St.  Gregory-by-St. Paul. Almost all our cathedrals have churches close to  them, such as St. Margaret's, Westminster; St. Laurence, Winchester;  St. John's, Peterborough; St. Nicholas, Rochester. In all cases they  are churches of the parishioners, as contrasted with those of the  monastery or the cathedral body. St. Gregory's Church was not only  near St. Paul's, but joined it; its north wall was part of the south  wall of the cathedral. Its early history is lost in antiquity, but it  was in existence before the Conquest[2]. The body of St. Edmund, K. &  M., had been preserved in it during the Danish invasions, before it  was carried to Bury St. Edmunds by Cnut for burial. It shared the  decay of the cathedral, and in the last days it was repaired, as was  the west end, by Inigo Jones in his own style, as will be seen by the  illustrations. Of the tombs and chantries which had by this time been  set up, it will be more convenient to speak hereafter, as also of the  deanery, which Dean Ralph de Diceto (d. 1283) built on its present  site.    Before the end of the thirteenth century Old St. Paul's was complete.  In the first quarter of the fourteenth century, a handsome marble  pavement, \"which cost _5d._ a foot,\" was laid down over \"the New  Work,\" eastward, and the spire, which, being of lead over timber, was  in a dangerous condition, was taken down and a very fine one set in  its place, surmounted by a cross and a gilt pommel[3] large enough  to contain ten bushels of corn. Bishop Gilbert Segrave (who had  previously been precentor of the cathedral, and was bishop from  1313 to 1317) came to the dedication. \"There was a great and solemn  procession and relics of saints were placed within\" (Dugdale). But the  following extract from a chronicle in the Lambeth library is worth  quoting: \"On the tenth of the calends of June, 1314, Gilbert, Bishop  of London, dedicated altars, namely, those of the Blessed Virgin Mary,  of St. Thomas the Martyr, and of the Blessed Dunstan, in the new  buildings of the Church of St. Paul, London. In the same year the  cross and the ball, with great part of the campanile, of the Church of  St. Paul were taken down because they were decayed and dangerous, and  a new cross, with a ball well gilt, was erected; and many relics of  divers saints were for the protection of the aforesaid campanile and  of the whole structure beneath, placed within the cross, with a great  procession, and with due solemnity, by Gilbert the bishop, on the  fourth of the nones of October; in order that the Omnipotent God and  the glorious merits of His saints, whose relics are contained within  the cross, might deign to protect it from all danger of storms. Of  whose pity twenty-seven years and one hundred and fifty days of  indulgence, at any time of the year, are granted to those who assist  in completing the fabric of the aforesaid church.\"    [Illustration: A BISHOP PLACING RELICS IN AN ALTAR.  _From a Pontifical of the Fourteenth Century. British Museum, Lans._  451.]    [Illustration: A PAPAL LEGATE.  _From the Decretals of Boniface VIII. British Museum_, 23923.]      In the Bodleian Library there is an inventory of these relics, amongst  them part of the wood of the cross, a stone of the Holy Sepulchre, a  stone from the spot of the Ascension, and some bones of the eleven  thousand virgins of Cologne.    The high altar was renewed in 1309 under an indented covenant between  Bishop Baldock and a citizen named Richard Pickerill. \"A beautiful  tablet was set thereon, variously adorned with many precious stones  and enamelled work; as also with divers images of metal; which tablet  stood betwixt "]]]
