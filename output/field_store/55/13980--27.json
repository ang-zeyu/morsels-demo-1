Indeed, the history of the first hundred years of its evolution resolves  itself into a series of internal and external crises, of varying severity,  devastating in their immediate effects, but each mysteriously releasing a  corresponding measure of divine power, lending thereby a fresh impulse to  its unfoldment, this further unfoldment engendering in its turn a still  graver calamity, followed by a still more liberal effusion of celestial  grace enabling its upholders to accelerate still further its march and win  in its service still more compelling victories.    In its broadest outline the first century of the Baha'i Era may be said to  comprise the Heroic, the Primitive, the Apostolic Age of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah, and also the initial stages of the Formative, the  Transitional, the Iron Age which is to witness the crystallization and  shaping of the creative energies released by His Revelation. The first  eighty years of this century may roughly be said to have covered the  entire period of the first age, while the last two decades may be regarded  as having witnessed the beginnings of the second. The former commences  with the Declaration of the Bab, includes the mission of Baha'u'llah, and  terminates with the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The latter is ushered in by  His Will and Testament, which defines its character and establishes its  foundation.    The century under our review may therefore be considered as falling into  four distinct periods, of unequal duration, each of specific import and of  tremendous and indeed unappraisable significance. These four periods are  closely interrelated, and constitute successive acts of one, indivisible,  stupendous and sublime drama, whose mystery no intellect can fathom, whose  climax no eye can even dimly perceive, whose conclusion no mind can  adequately foreshadow. Each of these acts revolves around its own theme,  boasts of its own heroes, registers its own tragedies, records its own  triumphs, and contributes its own share to the execution of one common,  immutable Purpose. To isolate any one of them from the others, to  dissociate the later manifestations of one universal, all-embracing  Revelation from the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest  days, would be tantamount to a mutilation of the structure on which it  rests, and to a lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history.    The first period (1844-1853), centers around the gentle, the youthful and  irresistible person of the Bab, matchless in His meekness, imperturbable  in His serenity, magnetic in His utterance, unrivaled in the dramatic  episodes of His swift and tragic ministry. It begins with the Declaration  of His Mission, culminates in His martyrdom, and ends in a veritable orgy  of religious massacre revolting in its hideousness. It is characterized by  nine years of fierce and relentless contest, whose theatre was the whole  of Persia, in which above ten thousand heroes laid down their lives, in  which two sovereigns of the Qajar dynasty and their wicked ministers  participated, and which was supported by the entire _Sh_i'ah  ecclesiastical hierarchy, by the military resources of the state, and by  the implacable hostility of the masses. The second period (1853-1892)  derives its inspiration from the august figure of Baha'u'llah, preeminent  in holiness, awesome in the majesty of His strength and power,  unapproachable in the transcendent brightness of His glory. It opens with  the first stirrings, in the soul of Baha'u'llah while in the Siyah-_Ch_al  of Tihran, of the Revelation anticipated by the Bab, attains its plenitude  in the proclamation of that Revelation to the kings and ecclesiastical  leaders of the earth, and terminates in the ascension of its Author in the  vicinity of the prison-town of Akka. It extends over thirty-nine years of  continuous, of unprecedented and overpowering Revelation, is marked by the  propagation of the Faith to the neighboring territories of Turkey, of  Russia, of 'Iraq, of Syria, of Egypt and of India, and is distinguished by  a corresponding aggravation of hostility, represented by the united  attacks launched by the _Sh_ah of Persia and the Sultan of Turkey, the two  admittedly most powerful potentates of the East, as well as by the  opposition of the twin sacerdotal orders of _Sh_i'ah and Sunni Islam. The  third period (1892-1921) revolves around the vibrant personality of  'Abdu'l-Baha, mysterious in His essence, unique in His station,  astoundingly potent in both the charm and strength of His character. It  commences with the announcement of the Covenant of Baha'u'llah, a document  without parallel in the history of any earlier Dispensation, attains its  climax in the emphatic assertion by the Center of that Covenant, in the  City of the Covenant, of the unique character and far-reaching  implications of that Document, and closes with His passing and the  interment of His remains on Mt. Carmel. It will go down in history as a  period of almost thirty years' duration, in which tragedies and triumphs  have been so intertwined as to eclipse at one time the Orb of the  Covenant, and at another time to pour forth its light over the continent  of Europe, and as far as Australasia, the Far East and the North American  continent. The fourth period (1921-1944) is motivated by the forces  radiating from the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, that Charter of  Baha'u'llah's New World Order, the offspring resulting from the mystic  intercourse between Him Who is the Source of the Law of God and the mind  of the One Who is the vehicle and interpreter of that Law. The inception  of this fourth, this last period of the first Baha'i century synchronizes  with the birth of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Era, with the founding  of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah--a system which is  at once the harbinger, the nucleus and pattern of His World Order. This  period, covering the first twenty-three years of this Formative Age, has  already been distinguished by an outburst of further hostility, of a  different character, accelerating on the one hand the diffusion of the  Faith over a still wider area in each of the five continents of the globe,  and resulting on the other in the emancipation and the recognition of the  independent status of several communities within its pale.    These four periods are to be regarded not only as the component, the  inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as progressive stages in a  single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible. For as we  survey the entire range which the operation of a century-old Faith has  unfolded before us, we cannot escape the conclusion that from whatever  angle we view this colossal scene, the events associated with these  periods present to us unmistakable evidences of a slowly maturing process,  of an orderly development, of internal consolidation, of external  expansion, of a gradual emancipation from the fetters of religious  orthodoxy, and of a corresponding diminution of civil disabilities and  restrictions.    Viewing these periods of Baha'i history as the constituents of a single  entity, we note the chain of events proclaiming successfully the rise of a  Forerunner, the Mission of One Whose advent that Forerunner had promised,  the establishment of a Covenant generated through the direct authority of  the Promised One Himself, and lastly the birth of a System which is the  child sprung from both the Author of the Covenant and its appointed  Center. We observe how the Bab, the Forerunner, announced the impending  inception of a divinely-conceived Order, how Baha'u'llah, the Promised  One, formulated its laws and ordinances, how 'Abdu'l-Baha, the appointed  Center, delineated its features, and how the present generation of their  followers have commenced to erect the framework of its institutions. We  watch, through these periods, the infant light of the Faith diffuse itself  from its cradle, eastward to India and the Far East, westward to the  neighboring territories of 'Iraq, of Turkey, of Russia, and of Egypt,  travel as far as the North American continent, illuminate subsequently the  major countries of Europe, envelop with its radiance, at a later stage,  the Antipodes, brighten the fringes of the Arctic, and finally set aglow  the Central and South American horizons. We witness a corresponding  increase in the diversity of the elements within its fellowship, which  from being confined, in the first period of its history, to an obscure  body of followers chiefly recruited from the ranks of the masses in  _Sh_i'ah Persia, has expanded into a fraternity representative of the  leading religious systems of the world, of almost every caste and color,  from the humblest worker and peasant to royalty itself. We notice a  similar development in the extent of its literature--a literature which,  restricted at first to the narrow range of hurriedly transcribed, often  corrupted, secretly circulated, manuscripts, so furtively perused, so  frequently effaced, and at times even eaten by the terrorized members of a  proscribed sect, has, within the space of a century, swelled into  innumerable editions, comprising tens of thousands of printed volumes, in  diverse scripts, and in no less than forty languages, some elaborately  reproduced, others profusely illustrated, all methodically and vigorously  disseminated through the agency of world-wide, properly constituted and  specially organized committees and Assemblies. We perceive a no less  apparent evolution in the scope of its teachings, at first designedly  rigid, complex and severe, subsequently recast, expanded, and liberalized  under the succeeding Dispensation, later expounded, reaffirmed and  amplified by an appointed Interpreter, and lastly systematized and  universally applied to both individuals and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#2)"],[1,"in the realm of the  righteous, submerged in an ocean of lights.            ISMU'LLAHU'L-ASDAQ      Among the Hands of the Cause of God who have departed this life and  ascended to the Supreme Horizon was Jinab-i-Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq. Another  was Jinab-i-Nabil-i-Akbar. Still others were Jinab-i-Mulla 'Ali-Akbar and  Jinab-i-_Sh_ay_kh_ Muhammad-Riday-i-Yazdi. Again, among others, was the  revered martyr, Aqa Mirza Varqa.    Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq was truly a servant of the Lord from the beginning of  life till his last breath. When young, he joined the circle of the late  Siyyid Kazim and became one of his disciples. He was known in Persia for  his purity of life, winning fame as Mulla Sadiq the saintly. He was a  blessed individual, a man accomplished, learned, and much honored. The  people of _Kh_urasan were strongly attached to him, for he was a great  scholar and among the most renowned of matchless and unique divines. As a  teacher of the Faith, he spoke with such eloquence, such extraordinary  power, that his hearers were won over with great ease.    After he had come to Ba_gh_dad and attained the presence of Baha'u'llah,  he was seated one day in the courtyard of the men's apartments, by the  little garden. I was in one of the rooms just above, that gave onto the  courtyard. At that moment a Persian prince, a grandson of Fath-'Ali  _Sh_ah, arrived at the house. The prince said to him, \"Who are you?\"  Ismu'llah answered, \"I am a servant of this Threshhold. I am one of the  keepers of this door.\" And as I listened from above, he began to teach the  Faith. The prince at first objected violently; and yet, in a quarter of an  hour, gently and benignly, Jinab-i-Ismu'llah had quieted him down. After  the prince had so sharply denied what was said, and his face had so  clearly reflected his fury, now his wrath was changed to smiles and he  expressed the greatest satisfaction at having encountered Ismu'llah and  heard what he had to say.    He always taught cheerfully and with gaiety, and would respond gently and  with good humor, no matter how much passionate anger might be turned  against him by the one with whom he spoke. His way of teaching was  excellent. He was truly Ismu'llah, the Name of God, not for his fame but  because he was a chosen soul.    Ismu'llah had memorized a great number of Islamic traditions and had  mastered the teachings of _Sh_ay_kh_ Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim. He became a  believer in _Sh_iraz, in the early days of the Faith, and was soon widely  known as such. And because he began to teach openly and boldly, they hung  a halter on him and led him about the streets and bazars of the city. Even  in that condition, composed and smiling, he kept on speaking to the  people. He did not yield; he was not silenced. When they freed him he left  _Sh_iraz and went to _Kh_urasan, and there, too, began to spread the  Faith, following which he traveled on, in the company of Babu'l-Bab, to  Fort Tabarsi. Here he endured intense sufferings as a member of that band  of sacrificial victims. They took him prisoner at the Fort and delivered  him over to the chiefs of Mazindaran, to lead him about and finally kill  him in a certain district of that province. When, bound with chains,  Ismu'llah was brought to the appointed place, God put it into one man's  heart to free him from prison in the middle of the night and guide him to  a place where he was safe. Throughout all these agonizing trials he  remained staunch in his faith.    Think, for example, how the enemy had completely hemmed in the Fort, and  were endlessly pouring in cannon balls from their siege guns. The  believers, among them Ismu'llah, went eighteen days without food. They  lived on the leather of their shoes. This too was soon consumed, and they  had nothing left but water. They drank a mouthful every morning, and lay  famished and exhausted in their Fort. When attacked, however, they would  instantly spring to their feet, and manifest in the face of the enemy a  magnificent courage and astonishing resistance, and drive the army back  from their walls. The hunger lasted eighteen days. It was a terrible  ordeal. To begin with, they were far from home, surrounded and cut off by  the foe; again, they were starving; and then there were the army's sudden  onslaughts and the bombshells raining down and bursting in the heart of  the Fort. Under such circumstances to maintain an unwavering faith and  patience is extremely difficult, and to endure such dire afflictions a  rare phenomenon.(2)    Ismu'llah did not slacken under fire. Once freed, he taught more widely  than ever. He spent every waking breath in calling the people to the  Kingdom of God. In 'Iraq, he attained the presence of Baha'u'llah, and  again in the Most Great Prison, receiving from Him grace and favor.    He was like a surging sea, a falcon that soared high. His visage shone,  his tongue was eloquent, his strength and steadfastness astounding. When  he opened his lips to teach, the proofs would stream out; when he chanted  or prayed, his eyes shed tears like a spring cloud. His face was luminous,  his life spiritual, his knowledge both acquired and innate; and celestial  was his ardor, his detachment from the world, his righteousness, his piety  and fear of God.    Ismu'llah's tomb is in Hamadan. Many a Tablet was revealed for him by the  Supreme Pen of Baha'u'llah, including a special Visitation Tablet after  his passing. He was a great personage, perfect in all things.    Such blessed beings have now left this world. Thank God, they did not  linger on, to witness the agonies that followed the ascension of  Baha'u'llah--the intense afflictions; for firmly rooted mountains will  shake and tremble at these, and the high-towering hills bow down.    He was truly Ismu'llah, the Name of God. Fortunate is the one who  circumambulates that tomb, who blesses himself with the dust of that  grave. Upon him be salutations and praise in the Abha Realm.            MULLA 'ALI-AKBAR      Yet another Hand of the Cause was the revered Mulla 'Ali-Akbar, upon him  be the glory of God, the All-Glorious. Early in life, this illustrious man  attended institutions of higher learning and labored diligently, by day  and night, until he became thoroughly conversant with the learning of the  day, with secular studies, philosophy, and religious jurisprudence. He  frequented the gatherings of philosophers, mystics, and _Sh_ay_kh_is,  thoughtfully traversing those areas of knowledge, intuitive wisdom, and  illumination; but he thirsted after the wellspring of truth, and hungered  for the bread that comes down from Heaven. No matter how he strove to  perfect himself in those regions of the mind, he was never satisfied; he  never reached the goal of his desires; his lips stayed parched; he was  confused, perplexed, and felt that he had wandered from his path. The  reason was that in all those circles he had found no passion; no joy, no  ecstasy; no faintest scent of love. And as he went deeper into the core of  those manifold beliefs, he discovered that from the day of the Prophet  Muhammad's advent until our own times, innumerable sects have arisen:  creeds differing among themselves; disparate opinions, divergent goals,  uncounted roads and ways. And he found each one, under some plea or other,  claiming to reveal spiritual truth; each one believing that it alone  followed the true path--this although the Muhammedic sea could rise in one  great tide, and carry all those sects away to the ocean floor. \"No cry  shalt thou hear from them, nor a whisper even.\"(3)    Whoso ponders the lessons of history will learn that this sea has lifted  up innumerable waves, yet in the end each has dissolved and vanished, like  a shadow drifting by. The waves have perished, but the sea lives on. This  is why 'Ali Qabl-i-Akbar could never quench his thirst, till the day when  he stood on the shore of Truth and cried:    Here is a sea with treasure to the brim;  Its waves toss pearls under the great wind's thong.  Throw off your robe and plunge, nor try to swim,  Pride not yourself on swimming--dive headlong.    Like a fountain, his heart welled and jetted forth; meaning and truth,  like soft-flowing crystal waters, began to stream from his lips. At first,  with humility, with spiritual poverty, he garnered the new light, and only  then he proceeded to shed it abroad. For how well has it been said,    Shall he the gift of life to others bear  Who of life's gift has never had a share?    A teacher must proceed in this way: he must first teach himself, and then  others. If he himself still walks the path of carnal appetites and lusts,  how can he guide another to the \"evident signs\"(4) of God?    This honored man was successful in converting a multitude. For the sake of  God he cast all caution aside, as he hastened along the ways of love. He  became as one frenzied, as a vagrant and one known to be mad. Because of  his new Faith, he was mocked at in Tihran by high and low. When he walked  through the streets and bazars, the people pointed their fingers at him,  calling him a Baha'i. Whenever trouble broke out, he was the one to be  arrested first. He was always ready and waiting for this, since it never  failed.    Again and again he was bound with chains, jailed, and threatened with the  sword. The photograph of this blessed individual, together with that of  the great Amin, taken of them in their chains, will serve as an example to  whoever has eyes to see. There they sit, those two distinguished men, hung  with chains, shackled, yet composed, acquiescent, undisturbed.    Things came to such a pass that in the end whenever there was an uproar  Mulla 'Ali would put on his turban, wrap himself in his 'aba and sit  waiting, for his enemies to rouse and the farra_sh_es to break in and the  guards to carry him off to prison. But observe the power of God! In spite  of all this, he was kept safe. \"The sign of a knower and lover is this,"]]]
