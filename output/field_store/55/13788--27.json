[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#2)"],[1,"especial mention is made at p. 99, post. This version was  printed in 1821, for private, distribution; and only 100 copies were struck  off. M. Crapelet, in whose office it was printed, felt the embers of  discontent rekindled in his bosom as it passed through his press; and in  the following year HE also stepped forward to discharge an arrow at the  Traveller. Like his predecessor, he printed but a limited number; and as I  have more particularly remarked upon the spirit of that version by way of  \"Introduction\" to the original letter, in vol. ii. 209, &c. I shall not  waste the time of the Reader by any notice of it in the present place.  These two partial translators united their forces, about two years  afterwards, and published the whole of the Tour, as it related to FRANCE,  in four octavo volumes, in 1825. The ordinary copies were sold for 48  francs, the large paper for 112 francs per copy. The wood-cuts only were  republished by them. Of this conjoint, and more enlarged production,  presently.    Encouraged by the examples of Messrs. Licquet and Crapelet, a Bookbinder of  the name of LESNE (whose poem upon his \"Craft,\" published in 1820, had been  copiously quoted and _commended_ by me in the previous edition) chose to  plant his foot within this arena of controversy; and to address a letter to  me; to which his model, M. Crapelet, was too happy to give circulation  through the medium of his press.[3] To that letter the following metrical  lines are prefixed; which the Reader would scarcely forgive me if I failed  to amuse him by their introduction in this place. \"_Lesne, Relieur  Francais, a Mons. T.F. Dibdin, Ministre de la Religion, &c._\"      Avec un ris moqueur, je crois vous voir d'ici,    Dedaigneusement dire: Eh, que veut celui-ci?    Qu'ai-je donc de commun avec un vil artiste?    Un ouvrier francais, un _Bibliopegiste_?    Ose-t-on ravaler un Ministre a ce point?    Que me veut ce _Lesne_? Je ne le connais point.      Je crois me souvenir qu'a mon voyage en France,    Avec ses pauvres vers je nouai connaissance.    Mais c'est si peu de chose un poete a Paris!      Savez-vous bien, Monsieur, pourquoi je vous ecris?    C'est que je crois avoir le droit de vous ecrire.    Fussiez-vous cent fois plus qu'on ne saurait le dire,    Je vois dans un Ministre un homme tel que moi;    Devant Dieu je crois meme etre l'egal d'un roi.    The Letter however is in prose, with some very few exceptions; and it is  just possible that the indulgent Reader may endure a specimen or two of the  prose of M. Lesne, as readily as he has that of his poetry. These specimens  are equally delectable, of their kind. Immediately after the preceding  poetical burst, the French Bibliopegist continues thus:        D'apres cet exorde, vous pensez sans doute que, bien convaincu de ma      dignite d'homme, je me crois en droit de vous dire franchement ma      facon de penser; je vous la dirai, Monsieur. Si vous dirigiez un      journal bibliographique; que vous fissiez, en un mot, le metier de      journaliste, je serai peu surpris de voir dans votre Trentieme Lettre,      une foule de choses hasardees, de mauvais calembourgs, de      grossieretes, que nous ne rencontrons meme pas chez nos journalistes      du dernier ordre, en ce qu'ils savent mieux leur monde, et que s'ils      lancent une epigramme, fut-elle fausse, elle est au moins finement      tournee. Mais vous etes ANGLAIS, et par cela seul dispense sans doute      de cette politesse qui distingue si heureusement notre nation de la      votre, et que vos compatriotes n'acquierent pour la plupart qu'apres      un long sejour en France.\" p. 6.    Towards the latter part of this most formidable \"Tentamen Criticum,\" the  irritable author breaks out thus--\"C'est une maladie Francaise de vouloir  toujours imiter les Anglais; ceux-ci, a leur tour, commencent a en etre  atteints.\" p. 19. A little farther it is thus: \"Enfin c'est _en imitant_  qu'on reussit presque toujours mal; vous en etes encore, une preuve  evidente. J'ai vu en beaucoup d'endroits de votre Lettre, que vous avez  voulu imiter _Sterne_;[4] qu'est-il arrive? Vous etes reste au-dessous de  lui, comme tous les Imitateurs de notre bon La Fontaine sont restes en deca  de l'immortel Fabuliste.\" p. 20. But most especially does the sensitive M.  Lesne betray his surprise and apprehension, on a gratuitous  supposition--thrown out by me, by way of pleasantry--that \"Mr. Charles  Lewis was going over to Paris, to establish there a modern School of  Bookbinding.\" M. Lesne thus wrathfully dilates upon this supposition:        \"Je me garderai bien de passer sous silence la derniere partie de      votre Lettre; _un bruit assez etrange est venu jusqu'a vous_; et      Charles Lewis doit vous quitter pour quelque temps pour etablir en      France une ecole de reliure d'apres les principes du gout anglais;      mais vous croyez, dites-vous, que ce projet est surement chimerique,      ou que, si on le tentait, il serait de courte duree.        Pour cette fois, Monsieur, votre pronostic serait tres juste; cette      demarche serait une folie: il faudrait s'abuser sur l'engouement des      amateurs francais, et ceux qui sont atteints de cette maladie ne sont      pas en assez grand nombre pour soutenir un pareil etablissement. Oui,      l'on aime votre genre de reliure; mais on aime les reliures, facon      anglaise, faites par les Francais. Pensez-vous done, ou Charles Lewis      pense-t-il, qu'il n'y ait plus d'esprit national en France?          Allez, le sang Francaise coule encore dans nos veines;        Nous pourrons eprouver des malheurs et des peines,        Que nous devrons peut etre a vous autres Anglais;        Mais nous voulons rester, nous resterons, Francais!        Ainsi, que Charles Lewis ne se derange pas; qu'il cesse, s'il les a      commences, les preparatifs de sa descente; qu'il ne prive pas ses      compatriotes d'un artiste soi-disant inimitable. Nous en avons ici qui      le valent, et qui se feront un plaisir de perpeteur parmi nous le bon      gout, l'elegance, et la noble simplicite. p. 25.[5]    So much for M. Lesne. I have briefly noticed M. Peignot, the Bibliographer  of Dijon. That worthy wight has made the versions of my Ninth and Thirtieth  Letters (First Edition) by M.M. Licquet and Crapelet, the substratum of his  first brochure entitled _Varietes, Notices et Raretes Bibliographiques_,  _Paris_, 1822: it being a supplement to his previous Work of _Curiosites  Bibliographiques_.\"[6] It is not always agreeable for an Author to have his  Works reflected through the medium of a translation; especially where the  Translator suffers a portion, however small, of his _own_ atrabiliousness,  to be mixed up with the work translated: nor is it always safe for a third  person to judge of the merits of the original through such a medium. Much  allowance must therefore be made for M. Peignot; who, to say the truth, at  the conclusion of his labours, seems to think that he has waded through a  great deal of _dirt_ of some kind or other, which might have been better  avoided; and that, in consequence, some general declaration, by way of  _wiping, off_ a portion of the adhering mud, is due to the original Author.  Accordingly, at the end of his analysis of M. Licquet's version, (which  forms the second Letter in the brochure) he does me the honour to devote  seven pages to the notice of my humble lucubrations:--and he prefaces this  \"_Notice des Ouvrages de M. Dibdin\"_, by the following very handsome  tribute to their worth:        Si, dans les deux Lettres ou nous avons rendu compte des traductions      partielles du voyage de M.D., nous avons partage l'opinion des deux      estimable traducteurs, sur quelques erreurs et quelques inconvenances      echappees a l'auteur anglais, nous sommes bien eloigne d'envelopper      dans le meme blame, tout ce qui est sorte de sa plume; car il y auroit      injustice a lui refuser des connaissances tres etendues en histoire      litteraire, et en bibliographie: nous le disons franchement, il      faudroit fermer les yeux a la lumiere, ou etre d'une partialite      revoltante, pour ne pas convenir que, juste appreciateur de tous les      tresors bibliographiques qu'il a le bonheur d'avoir sous la main, M.      Dibdin en a fait connoitre en detail toute la richesse dans de      nombreux d'ouvrages, ou tres souvent le luxe d'erudition se trouve en      harmonie avec le luxe typographique qu'il y a etale.    At the risk of incurring the imputation of vanity, I annex the preceding  extract; because I am persuaded that the candid Reader will appreciate it  in its proper light. I might, had I chosen to do so, have lengthened the  extract by a yet more complimentary passage: but enough of M. Peignot--who,  so far from suffering ill will or acerbity to predominate over a kind  disposition, hath been pleased, since his publication, to write to me a  very courteous Letter,[7] and to solicit a \"continuance of my favours.\"    Agreeably to the intimation expressed in a preceding page, I am now, in due  order, to notice the labours of my translators M.M. LICQUET and CRAPELET.  Their united version appeared in 1825, in four octavo volumes, of which the  small paper was but indifferently well printed.[8] The preface to the first  two volumes is by M. Licquet: and it is not divested of point and merit. It  begins by attacking the _Quarterly Review_, (June 1821, p. 147.) for its  severity of animadversion on the supposed listlessness and want of  curiosity of the French in exploring the architectural antiquities of their  country; and that, in consequence of such supineness, the English,  considering them as their own property, have described them accordingly.  \"The decision (says the French translator) is severe; happily it is without  foundation.\" After having devoted several pages to observations by way of  reply to that critical Journal, M. Licquet continues thus:--unless I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16250"],[0,"Tristan and Isolda: Opera in Three Acts (#2)"],[1,"ood,  he said to me,  he truly served but thee,  the pearl of womanhood;  if he unheeded  left the helm  how could he pilot the ship  in surety to King Mark?    ISOLDA (_bitterly_).  \"How could he pilot the ship  in surety to King Mark!\"  And wait on him with were-gild  from Ireland's island won!    BRANGAENA.  As I gave out the message  and in thy very words,  thus spoke his henchman Kurvenal--    ISOLDA.  Heard I not ev'ry sentence?  it all has reached my ear.  If thou hast learnt my disgrace  now hear too whence it has grown.      How scoffingly      they sing about me!  Quickly could I requite them!      What of the boat      so bare and frail,  that floated by our shore?      What of the broken      stricken man,  feebly extended there?      Isolda's art      he gladly owned;      with herbs, simples      and healing salves  the wounds from which he suffered  she nursed in skilful wise.      Though \"Tantris\"  The name that he took unto him,      as \"Tristan\"  anon Isolda knew him,  when in the sick man's keen blade  she perceived a notch had been made,      wherein did fit      a splinter broken  in Morold's head,  the mangled token  sent home in hatred rare:  this hand did find it there.  I heard a voice  from distance dim;  with the sword in hand  I came to him.  Full well I willed to slay him,  for Morold's death to pay him.  But from his sick bed  he looked up  not at the sword,  not at my arm--  his eyes on mine were fastened,  and his feebleness  softened my heart:  the sword--dropped from my fingers.  Though Morold's steel had maimed him  to health again I reclaimed him!  when he hath homeward wended  my emotion then might be ended.    BRANGAENA.  O wondrous! Why could I not see this?  The guest I sometime  helped to nurse--?    ISOLDA.  His praise briskly they sing now:--  \"Bravo, our brave Tristan!\"--  he was that distressful man.  A thousand protestations  of truth and love he prated.  Hear how a knight  fealty knows!--  When as Tantris  unforbidden he'd left me,  as Tristan  boldly back he came,  in stately ship  from which in pride  Ireland's heiress  in marriage he asked  for Mark, the Cornish monarch,  his kinsman worn and old.  In Morold's lifetime  dared any have dreamed  to offer us such an insult?  For the tax-paying  Cornish prince  to presume to court Ireland's princess!  Ah, woe is me!  I it was  who for myself  did shape this shame!  with death-dealing sword  should I have stabbed him;  weakly it escaped me:--  now serfdom I have shaped me.  Curse him, the villain!  Curse on his head!  Vengeance! Death!  Death for me too!    BRANGAENA (_throwing herself upon_ ISOLDA _with impetuous  tenderness_).  Isolda! lady!  loved one! fairest!  sweet perfection!  mistress rarest!  Hear me! come now,  sit thee here.--    (_Gradually draws_ ISOLDA _to the couch_.)    What a whim!  what causeless railing!  How came you so wrong-minded  and by mere fancy blinded?  Sir Tristan gives thee  Cornwall's kingdom;  then, were he erst thy debtor,  how could he reward thee better?  His noble uncle  serves he so:  think too what a gift  on thee he'd bestow!  With honor unequalled  all he's heir to  at thy feet he seeks to shower,  to make thee a queenly dower.    (ISOLDA _turns away_.)    If wife he'd make thee  unto King Mark  why wert thou in this wise complaining?  Is he not worth thy gaining?  Of royal race  and mild of mood,  who passes King Mark  in might and power?  If a noble knight  like Tristan serves him,  who would not but feel elated,  so fairly to be mated.    ISOLDA (_gazing vacantly before her_).  Glorious knight!  And I must near him  loveless ever languish!  How can I support such anguish?    BRANGAENA.  What's this, my lady?  loveless thou?    (_Approaching coaxingly and kissing_ ISOLDA.)    Where lives there a man  would not love thee?  Who could see Isolda  And not sink  at once into bondage blest?  And if e'en it could be  any were cold,  did any magic  draw him from thee,  I'd bring the false one  back to bondage,  And bind him in links of love.--    (_Secretly and confidentially, close to_ ISOLDA.)    Mindest thou not  thy mother's arts?  Think you that she  who'd mastered those  would have sent me o'er the sea,  without assistance for thee?    ISOLDA (_darkly_).  My mother's rede  I mind aright,  and highly her magic  arts I hold:--  Vengeance they wreak for wrongs,  rest give to wounded spirits.--  Yon casket hither bear.    BRANGAENA.  It holds a balm for thee.--    (_She brings forward a small golden coffer, opens it, and points to  its contents_.)    Thy mother placed inside it  her subtle magic potions.  There's salve for sickness  or for wounds,  and antidotes  for deadly drugs.--    (_She takes a bottle_.)    The helpfullest draught  I hold in here.    ISOLDA.  Not so, I know a better.  I make a mark  to know it again--  This draught 'tis I would drain.    (_Seizes flask and shows it_.)    BRANGAENA (_recoiling in horror_).  The draught of death!    (ISOLDA _has risen from the sofa and now hears with increasing dread  the cries of the sailors_.)    VOICES OF THE CREW (_without_).  \"Ho! heave ho! hey!  Reduce the sail!  The mainsail in!  Ho! heave ho! hey!\"    ISOLDA.  Our journey has been swift.  Woe is me! Near to the land!      SCENE IV.    (KURVENAL _boisterously enters through the curtains_.)    KURVENAL.  Up, up, ye ladies!  Look alert!  Straight bestir you!  Loiter not,--here is the land!--  To dame Isolda  says the servant  of Tristan,  our hero true:--  Behold our flag is flying!  it waveth landwards aloft:  in Mark's ancestral castle  may our approach be seen.  So, dame Isolda,  he prays to hasten,  for land straight to prepare her,  that thither he may bear her.    ISOLDA (_who has at first cowered and shuddered on hearing the  message, now speaks calmly and with dignity_). My greeting take  unto your lord  and tell him what I say now:  Should he assist to land me  and to King Mark would he hand me,  unmeet and unseemly  were his act,  the while my pardon  was not won  for trespass black and base:  So bid him seek my grace.    (KURVENAL _makes a gesture of defiance_.)    Now mark me well,  This message take:--  Nought will I yet prepare me,  that he to land may bear me;  I will not by him be landed,  nor unto King Mark be handed  ere granting forgiveness  and forgetfulness,  which 'tis seemly  he should seek:--  for all his trespass base  I tender him my grace.    KURVENAL.  Be assured,  I'll bear your words:  we'll see what he will say!    (_He retires quickly_.)      SCENE V.    ISOLDA (_hurries to_ BRANGAENA _and embraces her vehemently_).  Now farewell, Brangaena!  Greet ev'ry one,  Greet my father and mother!    BRANGAENA.  What now? what mean'st thou?  Wouldst thou flee?  And where must I then follow?    ISOLDA (_checking herself suddenly_).  Here I remain:  heard you not?  Tristan will I await.--  I trust in thee  to aid in this:  prepare the true  cup of peace:  thou mindest how it is made.    BRANGAENA.  What meanest thou?    ISOLDA (_taking a bottle from the coffer_).  This it is!  From the flask go pour  this philtre out;  yon golden goblet 'twill fill.    BRANGAENA (_filled with terror receiving the flask_).  Trust I my wits?    ISOLDA.  Wilt thou be true?    BRANGAENA.  The draught--for whom?    ISOLDA. Him who betrayed!    BRANGAENA. Tristan?    ISOLDA. Truce he'll drink with me.    BRANGAENA (_throwing herself at_ ISOLDA'S _feet_). O horror!  Pity thy handmaid!    ISOLDA. Pity thou me,  false-hearted maid!  Mindest thou not  my mother's arts?  Think you that she  who'd mastered those  would have sent thee o'er the sea  without assistance for me?  A salve for sickness  doth she offer  and antidotes  for deadly drugs:  for deepest grief  and woe supreme  gave she the draught of death.  Let Death now give her thanks!    BRANGAENA (_scarcely able to control herself_). O deepest  grief!    ISOLDA. Now, wilt thou obey?    BRANGAENA. O woe supreme!    ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?    BRANGAENA. The draught?    KURVENAL (_entering_). Sir Tristan!    (BRANGAENA _rises, terrified and confused_. ISOLDA _strives with  immense effort to control herself_.)    ISOLDA (_to Kurvenal_). Sir Tristan may approach!      SCENE VI.    [KURVENAL _retires again_. BRANGAENA, _almost beside herself,  turns up the stage_. ISOLDA, _mustering all her powers of  resolution, walks slowly and with dignity towards the sofa, by the  head of which she supports herself, turning her eyes firmly towards  the entrance_]    (TRISTAN _enters, and pauses respectfully at the entrance_.)    TRISTAN. Demand, lady,  what you will.    ISOLDA. While knowing not  what my demand is,  wert thou afraid  still to fulfil it,  fleeing my presence thus?    TRISTAN. Honor  Held me in awe.    ISOLDA. Scant honor hast thou  shown unto me;  for, unabashed,  withheldest thou  obedience unto my call.    TRISTAN. Obedience 'twas  forbade me to come.    ISOLDA. But little I owe  thy lord, methinks,  if he allows  ill manners  unto his own promised bride.    TRISTAN. In our land  it is the law  that he who fetches  home the bride  should stay afar from her.    ISOLDA. On what account?    TRISTAN. 'Tis the custom.    ISOLDA. Being so careful,  my lord Tristan,  another custom  can you not learn?  Of enemies friends make:  for evil acts amends make.    TRISTAN. Who is my foe?    ISOLDA. Find in thy fears!  Blood-guilt  gets between us.    TRISTAN. That was absolved.    ISOLDA. Not between us.    TRISTAN. In open field,  'fore all the folk  our old feud was abandoned.    ISOLDA. 'Twas not there  I held Tantris hid  when Tristan was laid low,  He stood there brawny,  bright and brave;  but in his truce  I took no part:  my tongue its silence had learnt.  When in chambered stillness  sick he lay  with the sword I stood  before him, stern;  silent--my lips,  motionless--my hand.  But that which my hand  and lips had once vowed,  I swore in stealth to adhere to:  lo! now my desire I'm near to.    TRISTAN. What hast thou sworn?"]]]
