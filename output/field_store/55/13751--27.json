It is to determine exactly such  questions that this Government understands the right of visit and search  to have been recognized.    This Government has carefully noted the explanatory statement issued by  the Imperial German Government at the same time with the proclamation of  the German Admiralty, and takes this occasion to remind the Imperial  German Government very respectfully that the Government of the United  States is open to none of the criticisms for unneutral action to which  the German Government believes the Governments of certain other neutral  nations have laid themselves open; that the Government of the United  States has not consented to or acquiesced in any measures which may have  been taken by the other belligerent nations in the present war which  operate to restrain neutral trade, but has, on the contrary, taken in  all such matters a position which warrants it in holding those  Governments responsible in the proper way for any untoward effects on  American shipping which the accepted principles of international law do  not justify; and that it, therefore, regards itself as free in the  present instance to take with a clear conscience and upon accepted  principles the position indicated in this note.    If the commanders of German vessels of war should act upon the  presumption that the flag of the United States was not being used in  good faith and should destroy on the high seas an American vessel or the  lives of American citizens, it would be difficult for the Government of  the United States to view the act in any other light than as an  indefensible violation of neutral rights, which it would be very hard,  indeed, to reconcile with the friendly relations now happily subsisting  between the two Governments.    If such a deplorable situation should arise, the Imperial German  Government can readily appreciate that the Government of the United  States would be constrained to hold the Imperial Government of Germany  to a strict accountability for such acts of their naval authorities, and  to take any steps it might be necessary to take to safeguard American  lives and property and to secure to American citizens the full enjoyment  of their acknowledged rights on the high seas.    The Government of the United States, in view of these considerations,  which it urges with the greatest respect and with the sincere purpose of  making sure that no misunderstandings may arise, and no circumstances  occur, that might even cloud the intercourse of the two Governments,  expresses the confident hope and expectation that the Imperial German  Government can and will give assurance that American citizens and their  vessels will not be molested by the naval forces of Germany otherwise  than by visit and search, though their vessels may be traversing the sea  area delimited in the proclamation of the German Admiralty. It is stated  for the information of the Imperial Government that representations have  been made to his Britannic Majesty's Government in respect to the  unwarranted use of the American flag for the protection of British  ships.      AMERICAN NOTE TO ENGLAND.    Feb. 10, 1915.    _The Secretary of State has instructed Ambassador Page at London to  present to the British Government a note to the following effect:_    The department has been advised of the declaration of the German  Admiralty on Feb. 4, indicating that the British Government had on Jan.  31 explicitly authorized the use of neutral flags on British merchant  vessels, presumably for the purpose of avoiding recognition by German  naval forces. The department's attention has also been directed to  reports in the press that the Captain of the Lusitania, acting upon  orders or information received from the British authorities, raised the  American flag as his vessel approached the British coasts, in order to  escape anticipated attacks by German submarines. Today's press reports  also contain an alleged official statement of the Foreign Office  defending the use of the flag of a neutral country by a belligerent  vessel in order to escape capture or attack by an enemy.    Assuming that the foregoing reports are true, the Government of the  United States, reserving for future consideration the legality and  propriety of the deceptive use of the flag of a neutral power in any  case for the purpose of avoiding capture, desires very respectfully to  point out to his Britannic Majesty's Government the serious consequences  which may result to American vessels and American citizens if this  practice is continued.    The occasional use of the flag of a neutral or an enemy under the stress  of immediate pursuit and to deceive an approaching enemy, which appears  by the press reports to be represented as the precedent and  justification used to support this action, seems to this Government a  very different thing from an explicit sanction by a belligerent  Government for its merchant ships generally to fly the flag of a neutral  power within certain portions of the high seas which are presumed to be  frequented with hostile warships. The formal declaration of such a  policy of general misuse of a neutral's flag jeopardizes the vessels of  the neutral visiting those waters in a peculiar degree by raising the  presumption that they are of belligerent nationality regardless of the  flag which they may carry.    In view of the announced purpose of the German Admiralty to engage in  active naval operations in certain delimited sea areas adjacent to the  coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, the Government of the United States  would view with anxious solicitude any general use of the flag of the  United States by British vessels traversing those waters. A policy such  as the one which his Majesty's Government is said to intend to adopt  would, if the declaration of the German Admiralty be put in force, it  seems clear, afford no protection to British vessels, while it would be  a serious and constant menace to the lives and vessels of American  citizens.    The Government of the United States, therefore, trusts that his  Majesty's Government will do all in their power to restrain vessels of  British nationality in the deceptive use of the United States flag in  the sea area defined by the German declaration, since such practice  would greatly endanger the vessels of a friendly power navigating those  waters and would even seem to impose upon the Government of Great  Britain a measure of responsibility for the loss of American lives and  vessels in case of an attack by a German naval force.    You will impress upon his Majesty's Government the grave concern which  this Government feels in the circumstances in regard to the safety of  American vessels and lives in the war zone declared by the German  Admiralty.    You may add that this Government is making earnest representations to  the German Government in regard to the danger to American vessels and  citizens if the declaration of the German Admiralty is put into effect.      GERMANY'S ANSWER.    _BERLIN, (via London,) Feb. 18.--German Government's reply to the  American note follows:_    The Imperial Government has examined the communication from the United  States Government in the same spirit of good-will and friendship by  which the communication appears to have been dictated. The Imperial  Government is in accord with the United States Government that for both  parties it is in a high degree desirable to avoid misunderstandings  which might arise from measures announced by the German Admiralty and to  provide against the occurrence of incidents which might trouble the  friendly relations which so far happily exist between the two  Governments.    With regard to the assuring of these friendly relations, the German  Government believes that it may all the more reckon on a full  understanding with the United States, as the procedure announced by the  German Admiralty, which was fully explained in the note of the 4th  inst., is in no way directed against legitimate commerce and legitimate  shipping of neutrals, but represents solely a measure of self-defense,  imposed on Germany by her vital interests, against England's method of  warfare, which is contrary to international law, and which so far no  protest by neutrals has succeeded in bringing back to the generally  recognized principles of law as existing before the outbreak of war.    In order to exclude all doubt regarding these cardinal points, the  German Government once more begs leave to state how things stand. Until  now Germany has scrupulously observed valid international rules  regarding naval warfare. At the very beginning of the war Germany  immediately agreed to the proposal of the American Government to ratify  the new Declaration of London, and took over its contents unaltered, and  without formal obligation, into her prize law.    The German Government has obeyed these rules, even when they were  diametrically opposed to her military interests. For instance, Germany  allowed the transportation of provisions to England from Denmark until  today, though she was well able, by her sea forces, to prevent it. In  contradistinction to this attitude, England has not even hesitated at a  second infringement of international law, if by such means she could  paralyze the peaceful commerce of Germany with neutrals. The German  Government will be the less obliged to enter into details, as these are  put down sufficiently, though not exhaustively, in the American note to  the British Government dated Dec. 29, as a result of five months'  experience.    All these encroachments have been made, as has been admitted, in order  to cut off all supplies from Germany and thereby starve her peaceful  civil population--a procedure contrary to all humanitarian principles.  Neutrals have been unable to prevent the interruption of their commerce  with Germany, which is contrary to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#2)"],[1,"Guards from our trenches west of the brick stacks followed and was  supported by the fire from the flanking position which had been seized  the previous night by the same regiments.    The attack succeeded, the brick stacks were occupied without difficulty,  and a line was established north and south through a point about forty  yards east of the brick stacks.    The casualties suffered by the Fifth Corps throughout the period under  review, and particularly during the month of February, have been  heavier than those on other parts of the line. I regret this, but do not  think, taking all circumstances into consideration, that they were  unduly numerous. The position then occupied by the Fifth Corps had  always been a very vulnerable part of our line. The ground was marshy,  and trenches were most difficult to construct and maintain. The  Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Divisions of the Fifth Corps had no  previous experience in European warfare, and a number of the units  composing the corps had only recently returned from service in tropical  climates. In consequence, the hardships of a rigorous Winter campaign  fell with greater weight upon these divisions than upon any other in the  command.    Chiefly owing to these causes the Fifth Corps, up to the beginning of  March, was constantly engaged in counter-attacks to retake trenches and  ground which had been lost. In their difficult and arduous task,  however, the troops displayed the utmost gallantry and devotion, and it  is most creditable to the skill and energy of their leaders that I am  able to report how well they have surmounted all their difficulties and  that the ground first taken over by them is still intact and held with  little greater loss than is incurred by the troops in all other parts of  the line.    _Describing an attack on the German trenches near St. Eloi on Feb. 28 by  Princess Patricia's Regiment, of the Canadian contingent, under command  of Lieut. C.E. Crabbe, the Commander in Chief says:_    The services performed by this distinguished corps have continued to be  very valuable since I had occasion to refer to them in my last dispatch.  They have been most ably organized and trained and were commanded by  Lieut. Colonel F.D. Farquhar, D.S.O., who I deeply regret to say was  killed while superintending some trench work on March 20. His loss will  be deeply felt.    _Emphasizing the co-operation of the British and French forces and the  new role in warfare assumed by the cavalry, the Commander in Chief  writes:_    During the month of February I arranged with General Foch to render the  Ninth French Corps, holding the trenches to my left, some much-needed  rest by sending the three divisions of the British Cavalry Corps to hold  a portion of the French trenches, each division for a period of ten days  alternately.    [Illustration: Map showing the field of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and  its position in the Allied line.]    It was very gratifying to me to note once again in this campaign the  eager readiness which the cavalry displayed to undertake a role which  does not properly belong to them in order to support and assist their  French comrades. In carrying out this work the leader, officers, and men  displayed the same skill and energy which I have had reason to comment  upon in former dispatches.    _Referring to Neuve Chapelle and the considerations leading up to this,  the Field Marshal says:_    About the end of February many vital considerations induced me to  believe that a vigorous offensive movement by the troops under my  command should be planned and carried out at the earliest possible  moment. Among the more important reasons which convinced me of this  necessity were the general aspect of the allied situation throughout  Europe, and particularly the marked success of the Russian Army in  repelling the violent onslaughts of Marshal von Hindenburg; the apparent  weakening of the enemy on my front, and the necessity for assisting our  Russian allies to the utmost by holding as many hostile troops as  possible in the western theatre; the efforts to this end which were  being made by the French forces at Arras and in Champagne, and--perhaps  the most weighty consideration of all--the need of fostering the  offensive spirit in the troops under my command after the trying and  possibly enervating experiences which they had gone through of a severe  Winter in the trenches.    In a former dispatch I commented upon the difficulties and drawbacks  which the Winter weather in this climate imposes upon a vigorous  offensive. Early in March these difficulties became greatly lessened by  the drying up of the country and by spells of brighter weather.    I do not propose in this dispatch to enter at length into the  considerations which actuated me in deciding upon the plan, time, and  place of my attack. As mentioned above, the main attack was carried out  by units of the First Army, supported by troops of the Second Army and  the general reserve. The object of the main attack was to be the capture  of the village of Neuve Chapelle and the enemy's position at that point,  and the establishment of our line as far forward as possible to the east  of that place.    The object, nature, and scope of the attack and the instructions for the  conduct of the operations were communicated by me to Sir Douglas Haig  in a secret memorandum, dated Feb. 19.    _After describing the main topographical features of the battlefield and  showing how the Germans had established a strong post with numerous  machine guns among the big houses, behind walls and in orchards which  flanked the approaches to the village, Sir John proceeds:_    The battle opened at 7:30 o'clock the morning of the 10th of March by a  powerful bombardment of the enemy's position in Neuve Chapelle. The  artillery bombardment had been well prepared and was most effective,  except on the extreme northern portion of the front of attack.    At 8:05 o'clock the Twenty-third and Twenty-fifth Brigades of the Eighth  Division assaulted the German trenches on the northwest of the village.  At the same hour the Garhwal Brigade of the Meerut (British India)  Division, which occupied a position to the south of Neuve Chapelle,  assaulted the German trenches in its front. The Garhwal Brigade and the  Twenty-fifth Brigade carried the enemy's lines of intrenchment, where  the wire entanglements had been almost entirely swept away by our  shrapnel fire.    The Twenty-third Brigade, however, on the northeast, was held up by wire  entanglements which were not sufficiently cut. At 8:05 o'clock the  artillery was turned on Neuve Chapelle, and at 8:35 o'clock the advance  of the infantry was continued. The Twenty-fifth and the Garhwal Brigades  pushed on eastward and northeastward, respectively, and succeeded in  getting a foothold in the village. The Twenty-third Brigade was still  held up in front of the enemy's wire entanglements, and could not  progress. Heavy losses were suffered, especially in the Middlesex  Regiment and the Scottish Rifles.    The progress, however, of the Twenty-fifth Brigade into Neuve Chapelle  immediately to the south of the Twenty-third Brigade had the effect of  turning the southern flank of the enemy's defenses in front of the  Twenty-third Brigade. This fact, combined with powerful artillery  support, enabled the Twenty-third Brigade to get forward between 10 and  11 A.M., and by 11 o'clock the whole of the village of Neuve Chapelle  and the roads leading northward and southwestward from the eastern end  of that village were in our hands.    During this time our artillery completely cut off the village and  surrounding country from any German reinforcements which could be thrown  into the fight to restore the situation, by means of a curtain of  shrapnel fire. Prisoners subsequently reported that all attempts at  reinforcing the front line were checked. Steps were at once taken to  consolidate the positions won.    Considerable delay occurred after the capture of the Neuve Chapelle  position. The infantry was greatly disorganized by the violent nature of  the attack and by its passage through the enemy's trenches and the  buildings of the village. It was necessary to get the units to some  extent together before pushing on. The telephonic communication being  cut by the enemy's fire rendered communication between the front and the  rear most difficult. The fact of the left of the Twenty-third Brigade  having been held up had kept back the Eighth Division and had involved a  portion of the Twenty-fifth Brigade in fighting to the north, out of its  proper direction of advance. All this required adjustment. An orchard  held by the enemy north of Neuve Chapelle also threatened the flank of  an advance toward the Aubers Bridge.    I am of the opinion that this delay would not have occurred had the  clearly expressed order of the general officer commanding the First Army  been carefully observed.    The difficulties above enumerated might have been overcome earlier in  the day if the general officer commanding the Fourth Corps had been able  to bring his reserve brigades more speedily into action. As it was, a  further advance did not commence before 3:30 o'clock. The Twenty-first  Brigade was able to form up in the open on the left without a shot being  fired at it, thus showing that, at the time, the enemy's resistance had  been paralyzed.    The brigade pushed forward in the direction of Moulin-du-Pietre. At  first it made good progress, but was subsequently held up by machine gun  fire from houses and from a defended work in the line of the German  intrenchments opposite the right of the Twenty-second Brigade.    Further to the south the Twenty-fourth Brigade, which had been directed  on Pietre, was similarly held up by machine guns in houses and trenches.  At the road junction, 600 yards to the northwest of Pietre, the  Twenty-fifth Brigade, on the right of"]]]
