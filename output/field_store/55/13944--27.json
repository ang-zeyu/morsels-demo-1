The tiller, D, as it is carried to starboard or port, slides through a  socket, E, pivoted to the crosshead.    The motion of the rudder is communicated to the steam cut-off by means  of the shaft, C, crank, J, rod, K, crank, I, and the hollow valve  spindle. When the tiller is amidships the valve handle, H, is at right  angles to the cylinder, and parallel to the tiller. By moving the  lever, H, to right or left, steam is admitted to one end or the other  of the cylinder, which, acting on the tiller through the piston,  piston rod, and crosshead, moves the rudder; and when the rudder  reaches the desired position the cut-off will have been moved the  amount necessary to prevent further entrance of steam. When the rudder  is influenced by the waves or by the expansion or contraction of  steam, the cut-off alters its position in relation to the valve and  automatically arranges the steam passages so that the piston is  returned to its proper position. The details of the cut-off are shown  in Fig. 2; the valve, G, which covers the cut-off, F, acts like a four  way cock. The spindle of the cut-off, F, is connected with the lever,  I, and is moved by the rudder, as already described. By enlarging or  gradually narrowing the ends of the steam ports great rigidity or  elasticity may be given to the hold of this engine, according to the  requirements of the particular vessel.    Few and simple as are the parts of this machine it is possible, by  balancing the valves and suiting the diameter of the cylinder to the  work to be performed, to overcome great resistances with a slight  effort. The inventor says that this system of valves is considered by  experts to be novel and very valuable.    In Fig. 3 is shown a pattern of a slide valve suited to special  purposes. Its working is essentially the same as that of the valve  already described. The ports are set side by side, parallel with the  sides of the valve. The supply port is in the middle, the other ports  lead to opposite ends of the cylinder.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    In Fig. 4 is shown another application of the controlling valve and  cut-off described above. Two oscillating steam cylinders are employed  in working the rudder. They are placed on opposite sides of the chest,  A, and are supplied with steam through the controlling valve, B. The  piston rods of the two cylinders are connected with cranks placed on  opposite ends of the shaft, C, at right angles to each other. Upon  this shaft, half-way between the pillow blocks which support it, there  is a worm which engages a toothed sector, D, on the rudder-post, E. To  an extension of the rudder-post is secured an arm, F, which is  connected with the arm, G, of the controlling valve. By shifting the  lever, H, the supply of steam to the two cylinders may be increased or  diminished, or its direction may be changed, so that the engines will  be reversed or stopped. This engine is remarkable for its simplicity.  The cylinders may be detached and changed if required, one size of bed  answering for three different sizes of cylinder, which may vary only  in diameter, the stroke being the same, so that the castings for  engines of different power are the same except in the matter of the  cylinders and pistons, and all the parts are interchangeable--a  feature of modern engine building that cannot be too highly valued.

On another page we print in full a most suggestive paper recently  read before the Manchester (Eng.) Scientific and Mechanical Society,  by Mr. Frederick Smith, a prominent builder of that city, contrasting  the qualities, styles, and prices of American and English builders'  hardware--a paper which the _Ironmonger_ pronounces one of the most  serious indictments yet preferred against British workmanship in that  department.    The field covered by the paper--the supplying of house builders'  hardware--embraces a multitude of conveniences, but no real  necessities. Why is it that America has been prolific in novel devices  and clever improvements in this department of manufacture as in so  many others, while England has gone on stolidly copying ancient forms,  changing only to cheapen by the introduction of poor material and sham  construction? Mr. Smith mentions several reasons that English  manufacturers have given him for the state of things he, as an  Englishman, so greatly deplores; but evidently he is not satisfied  with any of them, and very justly; for none of them touches the real  cause--the radically different attitude of the public mind toward  inventions, characteristic of the two countries.    In England the user of household inconveniences accepts them as  matters of fact; or if he grumbles at them he never thinks of trying  to change them. It is not his business; and if he should devise an  improvement, ten to one he could not get it made. To patent it is  practically out of the question, for if it were not condemned off-hand  as trivial, the patent fees would make it cost more than it was likely  to be worth. The mechanic who makes such things is trained to work to  pattern, and not waste his time on experiments. Besides, if he should  make a clever invention he would not be able to raise the necessary  fees for a patent, or to get any one to help him thereto. The  manufacturer \"makes what his customers call for.\" Why should he spend  his money and spoil his plant to introduce improvements? So things go,  until some pestilent Yankees flood the markets with better articles at  a lower price; and British consumers suddenly discover that they want  something that the native manufacturer cannot make. The need was  there; but invention did not follow. How happened it that the American  manufacturer did not pursue the same uninventive course? What produced  the radically different attitude of the American mind toward  newfangled notions out of which inventions proceeded and flourished?    No doubt several causes have been at work: freedom of thought and  action; popular education; a blending of races; and the tide of  adventurous spirits naturally resorting to a new and free land. These  have had their influence undoubtedly; but all these have existed, more  or less completely, in other new lands, without that outburst of  creative energy which has made America the nursery of inventions,  great and small. The determining cause, the one condition that  prevailed here and not elsewhere, was the circumstance that almost  from the start new ideas were given a market value in this country.  Unlike all others, the American patent law directly encouraged  independent thinking in all classes. The fees were low and the  protection offered fairly good. Men soon found that it paid to invent;  that one of the surest roads to competency was a patented improvement  on something of general use. If a household utensil or appliance went  wrong or worked badly, every user was directly interested in devising  something better; and, more than that, he was interested in making his  invention known and in securing its adoption. The workman at his bench  had an ever-present inducement to contrive something at once cheaper  and better than the article he was hired to make. He could patent his  improvement, or the wholly original device he might hit upon, for a  few dollars; and his patent would count as capital. It would make him  his own master, possibly bring him a fortune. The manufacturer could  not rest contented with the thing he set out to make, for the meanest  hired man in his employ might suddenly become a competitor. He must be  constantly alert for possible improvements, or his rivals would get  ahead of him. The result is a nation of inventors, at whose hands the  newest of lands has leaped to the leadership in the arts, almost at a  bound.    There is talk of changing all this; of emulating the conservative  spirit of the Old World; of putting inventors under bonds; of stopping  the rush of industrial improvement--to enable a few short-sighted yet  grasping corporations to get along without paying license fees for  such inventions as they happen to approve of. They profess to want  inventors to go on making improvements. They are willing to ascribe  all honor to the successful inventor; but they are determined not to  pay him for his work. Still more they are determined to change the  attitude of the public mind toward inventors and inventions, if such a  change can be wrought by plausible misrepresentations. The fact that  they were able to inveigle one branch of the American Congress into  assenting to their unjust and mischievous scheme is one of the  anomalies of our recent history. It should be taken as a timely  warning of impending danger to all the industrial interests of the  country. It is outrageous that the inventors of the land, after having  raised their country to the first rank among industrial nations,  should have to defend their constitutional rights against  Congressional invasion; but the fact exists; and the defense should be  made a matter of personal interest and effort not only by every  inventor and manufacturer, but by every honest citizen.           *       *       *       *       *          PLEURO-PNEUMONIA.      The cattle plague, which is creating so much anxiety throughout the  Eastern States, is a contagious fever, affecting cows chiefly,  characterized by extensive exudations into the respiratory organs, and  attended by a low typhus inflammation of the lungs, plurae, and  bronchia. It has prevailed in Europe for ages, at times developing  into wide-spread scourges, causing incalculable loss.

The most speedy and radical change was that effected in the  arts, industrial and ornamental. A steel knife was obviously better than  a stone knife; firearms than bows and arrows; and textile fabrics from  the looms of civilized men are at once seen to be more beautiful and  more useful than the rude fabrics and undressed skins with which the  Indians clothed themselves in that earlier day.    Customs and institutions changed less rapidly. Yet these have been much  modified. Imitation and vigorous propagandism have been more or less  efficient causes. Migrations and enforced removals placed tribes under  conditions of strange environment where new customs and institutions  were necessary, and in this condition civilization had a greater  influence, and the progress of occupation by white men within the  territory of the United States, at least, has reached such a stage that  savagery and barbarism have no room for their existence, and even  customs and institutions must in a brief time be completely changed,  and what we are yet to learn of these people must be learned now.    But in pursuing these studies the greatest caution must be observed in  discriminating what is primitive from what has been acquired from  civilized man by the various processes of acculturation.      ORIGIN OF MAN.    Working naturalists postulate evolution. Zooelogical research is largely  directed to the discovery of the genetic relations of animals. The  evolution of the animal kingdom is along multifarious lines and by  diverse specializations. The particular line which connects man with the  lowest forms, through long successions of intermediate forms, is a  problem of great interest. This special investigation has to deal  chiefly with relations of structure. From the many facts already  recorded, it is probable that many detached portions of this line can be  drawn, and such a construction, though in fact it may not be correct in  all its parts, yet serves a valuable purpose in organizing and directing  research.    The truth or error of such hypothetic genealogy in no way affects the  validity of the doctrines of evolution in the minds of scientific men,  but on the other hand the value of the tentative theory is brought to  final judgment under the laws of evolution.    It would be vain to claim that the course of zooelogic development is  fully understood, or even that all of its most important factors are  known. So the discovery of facts and relations guided by the doctrines  of evolution reacts upon these doctrines, verifying, modifying, and  enlarging them. Thus it is that while the doctrines lead the way to new  fields of discovery, the new discoveries lead again to new doctrines.  Increased knowledge widens philosophy; wider philosophy increases  knowledge.    It is the test of true philosophy that it leads to the discovery of  facts, and facts themselves can only be known as such; that is, can only  be properly discerned and discriminated by being relegated to their  places in philosophy. The whole progress of science depends primarily  upon this relation between knowledge and philosophy.    In the earlier history of mankind philosophy was the product of  subjective reasoning, giving mythologies and metaphysics. When it was  discovered that the whole structure of philosophy was without  foundation, a new order of procedure was recommended--the Baconian  method. Perception must precede reflection; observation must precede  reason. This also was a failure. The earlier gave speculations; the  later give a mass of incoherent facts and falsehoods. The error in the  earlier philosophy was not in the order of procedure between perception  and reflection, but in the method, it being subjective instead of  objective. The method of reasoning in scientific philosophy is purely  objective; the method of reasoning in mythology and metaphysics is  subjective.    The difference between man and the animals most nearly related to him in  structure is great. The connecting forms are no longer extant. This  subject of research, therefore, belongs to the paleontologists rather  than the ethnologists. The biological facts are embraced in the  geological record, and this record up to the present time has yielded  but scant materials to serve in its solution.    It is known that man, highly differentiated from lower animals in  morphologic characteristics, existed in early Quaternary and perhaps in  Pliocene times, and here the discovered record ends.      LANGUAGE.    In philology, North America presents the richest field in the world, for  here is found the greatest number of languages distributed among the  greatest number of stocks. As the progress of research is necessarily  from the known to the unknown, civilized languages were studied by  scholars before the languages of savage and barbaric tribes. Again, the  higher languages are written and are thus immediately accessible. For  such reasons, chief attention has been given to the most highly  developed languages. The problems presented to the philologist, in the  higher languages, cannot be properly solved without a knowledge of the  lower forms. The linguist studies a language that he may use it as an  instrument for the interchange of thought; the philologist studies a  language to use its data in the construction of a philosophy of  language. It is in this latter sense that the higher languages are  unknown until the lower languages are studied, and it is probable that  more light will be thrown upon the former by a study of the latter than  by more extended research in the higher.    The vast field of unwritten languages has been explored but not  surveyed. In a general way it is known that there are many such  languages, and the geographic distribution of the tribes of men who  speak them is known, but scholars have just begun the study of the  languages.    That the knowledge of the simple and uncompounded must precede the  knowledge of the complex and compounded, that the latter may be rightly  explained, is an axiom well recognized in biology, and it applies  equally well to philology. Hence any system of philology, as the term is  here used, made from a survey of the higher languages exclusively, will  probably be a failure. \"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit  unto his stature,\" and which of you by taking thought can add the  antecedent phenomena necessary to an explanation of the language of  Plato or of Spencer?    The study of astronomy, geology, physics, and biology, is in the hands  of scientific men; objective methods of research are employed and  metaphysic disquisitions find no place in the accepted philosophies;  but to a large extent philology remains in the hands of the  metaphysicians, and subjective methods of thought are used in the  explanation of the phenomena observed. If philology is to be a science  it must have an objective philosophy composed of a homologic  classification and orderly arrangement of the phenomena of the languages  of the globe.    Philologic research began with the definite purpose in view to discover  in the diversities of language among the peoples of the earth a common  element from which they were all supposed to have been derived, an  original speech, the parent of all languages. In this philologists had  great hopes of success at one time, encouraged by the discovery of the  relation between the diverse branches of the Aryan stock, but in this  very work methods of research were developed and doctrines established  by which unexpected results were reached.    Instead of relegating the languages that had before been unclassified to  the Aryan family, new families or stocks were discovered, and this  process has been carried on from year to year until scores or even  hundreds, of families are recognized, and until we may reasonably  conclude that there was no single primitive speech common to mankind,  but that man had multiplied and spread throughout the habitable earth  anterior to the development of organized languages; that is, languages  have sprung from innumerable sources after the dispersion of mankind.    The progress in language has not been by multiplication, which would be  but a progress in degradation under the now well-recognized laws of  evolution; but it has been in integration from a vast multiplicity  toward a unity. True, all evolution has not been in this direction.  There has often been degradation as exhibited in the multiplicity of  languages and dialects of the same stock, but evolution has in the  aggregate been integration by progress towards unity of speech, and  differentiation (which, must always be distinguished from  multiplication) by specialization of the grammatic process and the  development of the parts of speech.    When a people once homogeneous are separated geographically in such a  manner that thorough inter-communication is no longer preserved, all of  the agencies by which languages change act separately in the distinct  communities and produce different changes therein, and dialects are  established. If the separation continues, such dialects become distinct  languages in the sense that the people of one community are unable to  understand the people of another. But such a development of languages is  not differentiation in the sense in which this term is here used, and  often used in biology, but is analogous to multiplication as understood  in biology. The differentiation of an organ is its development for a  special purpose, _i. e._, the organic, specialization is concomitant  with functional specialization. When paws are differentiated into hands  and feet, with the differentiation of the organs, there is a concomitant  differentiation in the functions.    When one language becomes two, the same function is performed by each,  and is marked by the fundamental characteristic of multiplication,  _i."]]]
