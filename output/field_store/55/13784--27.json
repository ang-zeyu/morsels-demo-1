The Chief Inspector concluded that 'The probable cause of the accident  was the decision of the captain to continue the flight at low level  toward an area of poor surface and horizon definition when the crew was  not certain of their position and the subsequent inability to detect the  rising terrain which intercepted the aircraft's flight path'. He adhered  to this in evidence before the subsequent Royal Commission.    The Royal Commission was appointed on 11 June 1980 to inquire into 'the  causes and circumstances of the crash', an expression which was  elaborated in terms of reference consisting of paragraphs (a) to (j).  Mr. Justice Mahon was appointed sole Commissioner. In his report,  transmitted to the Governor-General by letter dated 16 April 1981 and  subsequently presented to the House of Representatives by Command of His  Excellency and later printed for public sale, the Commissioner found  that '... the single dominant and effective cause of the disaster was  the mistake made by those airline officials who programmed the aircraft  to fly directly at Mt. Erebus and omitted to tell the aircrew'. He  exonerated the crew from any error contributing to the disaster.    The Commissioner and the Chief Inspector were at one in concluding that  the crash has occurred in a whiteout. The Commissioner gave this vivid  reconstruction in the course of para. 40 of his report:         I have already made it clear that the aircraft struck the lower       slopes of Mt. Erebus whilst flying in clear air. The DC10 was at       the time flying under a total cloud cover which extended forward       until it met the mountain-side at an altitude of somewhere between       2000 and 2500 feet. The position of the sun at the time of impact       was directly behind the aircraft, being in a position approximately       to the true north of the mountain and shining at an inclination of       34 deg. The co-existence of these factors produced without doubt the       classic 'whiteout' phenomenon which occurs from time to time in       polar regions, or in any terrain totally covered by snow. Very       extensive evidence was received by the Commission as to the       occurrence and the consequences of this weather phenomenon. So long       as the view ahead from the flight deck of an aircraft flying over       snow under a solid overcast does not exhibit any rock, or tree, or       other landmark which can offer a guide as to sloping or uneven       ground, then the snow-covered terrain ahead of the aircraft will       invariably appear to be flat. Slopes and ridges will disappear. The       line of vision from the flight deck towards the horizon (if there       is one) will actually portray a white even expanse which is       uniformly level.         What this air crew saw ahead of them as the aircraft levelled out       at 3000 feet and then later at 1500 feet was a long vista of flat       snow-covered terrain, extending ahead for miles. Similarly, the       roof of the solid overcast extended forward for miles. In the far       distance the flat white terrain would either have appeared to have       reached the horizon many miles away or, more probably, merged       imperceptibly with the overhead cloud thus producing no horizon at       all. What the crew could see, therefore, was what appeared to be       the distant stretch of flat white ground representing the flat long       corridor of McMurdo Sound. In reality the flat ground ahead       proceeded for only about 6 miles before it intercepted the low ice       cliff which marked the commencement of the icy slope leading       upwards to the mountain, and at that point the uniform white       surface of the mountain slope proceeded upwards, first at an angle       of 13 deg., and then with a gradually increasing upward angle as it       merged with the ceiling of the cloud overhead. The only feature of       the forward terrain which was not totally white consisted of two       small and shallow strips of black rock at the very bottom of the       ice cliff, and these could probably not be seen from the flight       deck seats owing to the nose-up attitude of 5 deg. at which the       aircraft was travelling, or they were mistaken for thin strips of       sea previously observed by the crew as separating blocks of pack       ice.         The aircraft had thus encountered, at a fateful coincidence in       time, the insidious and unidentifiable terrain deception of a       classic whiteout situation. They had encountered that type of       visual illusion which makes rising white plateaux appear perfectly       flat. This freak of polar weather is known and feared by every       polar flier. In some Arctic regions in the Canadian and in the       north European winter, it is responsible for numbers of light       aircraft crashes every year. Aircraft fly, in clear air, directly       into hills and mountains. But neither Captain Collins nor First       Officer Cassin had ever flown at low altitude in polar regions       before. Even Mr Mulgrew [the commentator for the passengers], with       his antarctic experience, was completely deceived. The fact that       not one of the five persons on the flight deck ever identified the       rising terrain confirms the totality of this weird and dangerous       ocular illusion as it existed on the approach to Mt. Erebus at       12.50 p.m. on 28 November 1979.    Paragraph 165 of the Commissioner's report also merits quotation. We  have underlined some of it, indicating that in this particular part of  his report the Commissioner seems to accept that when they first heard  of the crash the management of the airline must have been unaware of the  true nature and danger of a whiteout. If so, they would have had no  reason to suppose that the pilot would have elected to fly at such a low  level without real visibility. That is an aspect which could well have  been strongly relied on if, when giving evidence before the  Commissioner, they had realised that they were being accused of trying  to cover up the cause of the crash from an early stage:         The term 'whiteout' has more than one meaning as being descriptive       of weather conditions in snow-covered terrain. For aviation       purposes it is often described as the cause of the visual       difficulty which occurs when a aircraft is attempting to land       during a snowstorm. As already stated, the United States Navy       maintains a special whiteout landing area situated to the south of       its normal landing strips near McMurdo Station. This area is used       when an aircraft, which is committed to a landing, is required to       land when visibility is obscured by a snowstorm. The snow in       Antarctica is perfectly dry, and a wind of only 20 kilometres can       sweep loose snow off the surface and fill the air with these fine       white particles. A landing on the special whiteout landing field       can be accomplished only by an aircraft equipped with skis or, in       the case of an aircraft without skis, then it must make a belly-up       landing on this snow-covered emergency airfield. Flying in a       'whiteout' of that description is no different from flying in thick       cloud. The pilot cannot know where he is and must land in       accordance with strict radio and radar directions. So far as I       understand the evidence, I do not believe that either the airline       or Civil Aviation Division ever understood the term 'whiteout' to       mean anything else than a snowstorm. I do not believe that they       were ever aware, until they read the chief inspector's report of       the type of 'whiteout' which occurs in clear air, in calm       conditions, and which creates this visual illusion which I have       previously described and which is, without doubt, the most       dangerous of all polar weather phenomena.    While largely agreed about the whiteout conditions, the Commissioner and  the Chief Inspector took quite different views as to whether the crew  had been uncertain of their position and visibility. This disagreement  is associated with a major difference as to the interpretation of the  tape recovered from the cockpit voice recorder covering the conversation  on the flight deck during the 30 minutes before the crash.    Both the Commissioner and the Chief Inspector found difficulty in  arriving at an opinion about what was said and by whom. Whereas the  Chief Inspector thought that the two flight engineers had voiced  mounting alarm at proceeding at a low level towards a cloud-covered  area, the Commissioner thought that Captain Collins and First Officer  Cassin had never expressed the slightest doubt as to where the aircraft  was and that 'not one word' was ever addressed by either of the flight  engineers to the pilots indicating any doubt. This is not a question on  which the present proceedings call for any opinion from this Court, nor  are we in any position to give one.    A major point in the Commissioner's reasoning, and one that helps to  explain the difference between the two reports, is that on the basis of  evidence from the wife and two daughters of Captain Collins he accepted  that, at home the night before the flight, the Captain had plotted on an  atlas and two maps a route of the flight; and he drew the inference that  Captain Collins must then have had with him a computer print-out. Any  such print-out would have been made before the alteration and  consequently would have shown the longitude of the southernmost waypoint  as 164 deg. 48' E. The Commissioner accordingly concluded that Captain  Collins had plotted a route down the Sound. No doubt this tended to  reinforce his view that the Captain, flying on nav track, had never  doubted that he was in fact over the Sound.

Then the Gordons turned out and gave us a cheer, for they had passed us in  the train as we crossed the line above Witteput, and they knew, those  veterans from Indian wars, what our raw Volunteers had done; they had been  on their feet from two o'clock on Wednesday morning until five o'clock of  the following day, with the heat at 122 in the shade, and bitter was their  wrath when they learnt that the Boer spies, who swarm all over the country,  had heralded their coming, so that the enemy had only waited to plant a few  shells into Belmont before disappearing into the hills beyond. That was the  cruel part of it. They did not mind the fatigue, they did not worry about  the thirst or the hunger, but to be robbed of a chance to show the world  what they could do in the teeth of the enemy was gall and wormwood to them,  and the curses they sent after the discreet Boer were weird, quaint,  picturesque, and painfully prolific.    We are lying with the Gordons now, waiting for the Boers to come along and  try to take Belmont, and our fellows and the \"Scotties\" are particularly  good chums, and it is the cordial wish of both that they may some day give  the enemy a taste of the bayonet together.                                      WITH THE AUSTRALIANS.                                                                       BELMONT.      Australia has had her first taste of war, not a very great or very  important performance, but we have buried our dead, and that at least binds  us more closely to the Motherland than ever before. The Queenslanders, the  wild riders, and the bushmen of the north-eastern portion of the continent  have been the first to pay their tribute to nationhood with the life blood  of her sons, two of whom--Victor James and McLeod--were buried by their  comrades on the scene of action a couple of days ago, whilst half a dozen  others, including Lieutenant Aide, fell more or less seriously wounded. The  story of the fight is simply told; there is no necessity for any wild  vapouring in regard to Australian courage, no need for hysterical praise.  Our fellows simply did what they were told to do in a quiet and workmanlike  manner, just as we who know them expected that they would; we are all proud  of them, and doubly proud that the men in the fight with them were our  cousins from Canada.    The most noteworthy fact about the engagement is to be gleaned by noting  that the Australians adopted Boer tactics, and so escaped the slaughter  that has so often fallen to the lot of the British troops when attacking  similar positions. Before describing the fight it may be as well to give  some slight idea of the disposition of the opposing forces. Our troops held  the railway line all the way from Cape Town to Modder River. At given  distances, or at points of strategic importance, strong bodies of men are  posted to keep the Boers from raiding, or from interfering with the railway  or telegraph lines. Such a force, consisting of Munster Fusiliers, two guns  of R.H. Artillery, the Canadians, and the Queenslanders, were posted at  Belmont under Colonel Pilcher. The enemy had no fixed camping ground.  Mounted on hardy Basuto ponies, carrying no provisions but a few mealies  and a little biltong, armed only with rifles, they sweep incessantly from  place to place, and are an everlasting source of annoyance to us. At one  moment they may be hovering in the kopjes around us at Enslin, waiting to  get a chance to sneak into the kopjes that immediately overlook our camp,  but thanks to the magnificent scouting qualities of the Victorian Mounted  Rifles, they have never been able to do so. During the night they disperse,  and take up their abode on surrounding farms as peaceful tillers of the  soil. In a day or so they organise again, and swoop down on some other  place, such as Belmont. Their armies, under men like Cronje or Joubert,  seldom move from strongly-entrenched positions.    The people I am referring to as reivers are farmers recruited by local  leaders, and are a particularly dangerous class of people to deal with, as  they know every inch of this most deceptive country. As soon as they are  whipped they make off to wives and home, and meet the scouts with a bland  smile and outstretched hand. It is no use trying to get any information out  of them, for no man living can look so much like an unmitigated fool when  he wants to as the ordinary, every-day farmer of the veldt. I know Chinamen  exceptionally well, I have had an education in the ways of the children of  Confucius; but no Chinaman that I have come in contact with could ever  imitate the half-idiotic smile, the patient, ox-like placidity of  countenance, the meek, religious look of holy resignation to the will of  Providence which comes naturally to the ordinary Boer farmer. It is this  faculty which made our very clever Army Intelligence people rank the farmer  of the veldt as a fool. Yet, if I am any judge, and I have known men in  many lands, our friend of the veldt is as clever and as crafty as any  Oriental I have yet mixed with.    Now for the Australian fight. On the day before Christmas, Colonel Pilcher,  at Belmont, got wind of the assemblage of a considerable Boer force at a  place 30 miles away, called Sunnyside Farm, and he determined to try to  attack it before the enemy could get wind of his intention. To this end he  secured every nigger for some miles around--which proved his good sense, as  the niggers are all in the pay of the Boers, no matter how loyal they may  pretend to be to the British, a fact which the British would do well to  take heed of, for it has cost them pretty dearly already. On Christmas Eve  he started out, taking two guns of the Royal Navy Artillery, a couple of  Maxims, all the Queenslanders, and a few hundred Canadians. Colonel  Pilcher's force numbered in all about 600 men. He marched swiftly all  night, and got to Sunnyside Farm in good time Christmas Day. The Boers had  not a ghost of an idea that our men were near them, and were completely  beaten at their own game, the surprise party being complete. The enemy were  found in a laager in a strong position in some rather steep kopjes, and it  was at once evident that they were expecting strong reinforcements from  surrounding farms. Colonel Pilcher at once extended his forces so as to try  to surround the kopjes. Whilst this was going on, Lieutenant Aide, with  four Queensland troopers, was sent to the far left of what was supposed to  be the Boer position. His orders were to give notice of any attempt at  retreat on the part of the enemy. He did his work well. Getting close to  the kopje, he saw a number of the enemy slinking off, and at once  challenged them. As he did so a dozen Boers dashed out of the kopje, and  Aide opened fire on them, which caused the Boers to fire a volley at him.  Lieutenant Aide fell from his horse with two bullets in his body; one went  through the fleshy part of his stomach, entering his body sideways, the  other went into his thigh. A trooper named McLeod was shot through the  heart, and fell dead. Both the other troopers were wounded. Trooper Rose  caught a horse, and hoisted his lieutenant into the saddle, and sent him  out of danger.    Meantime the R.H. Battery, taking range from Lieutenant Aide's fire, opened  out on the enemy. Their guns put a great fear into the Boers, and a general  bolt set in. The Boers fired as they cleared, and if our fellows had been  formed up in the style usual to the British army in action, we should have  suffered heavily; but the Queensland bushmen had dropped behind cover, and  soon had complete possession of the kopjes; another trooper named Victor  Jones was shot through the brain, and fourteen others were more or less  badly wounded. The Boers then surrendered. We took 40 prisoners, and found  about 14 dead Boers on the ground, besides a dozen wounded. They were all  Cape Dutch, no Transvaalers being found in their ranks. We secured 40,000  rounds of their ammunition, 300 Martini rifles, and only one Mauser rifle,  which was in the possession of the Boer commander. After destroying all  that we took, we moved on, and had a look at some of the farms near by, as  from some of the documents found in camp it was certain that the whole  district was a perfect nest of rebellion. Quite a little store of arms and  ammunition was discovered by this means, and the occupants of the farms  were therefore transported to Belmont. Our fellows carried the little  children and babies in their arms all the way, and marched into Belmont  singing, with the little ones on their shoulders. Every respect was shown  to the women, old and young, and to the old men, but the young fellows were  closely guarded all the time. The Canadians did not lose a single man,  neither did any of the others except the Queenslanders.    Another Boer commando, about 1,000 strong, with two batteries of artillery,  is now hovering in the ranges away to the north-west of Enslin, but Colonel  Hoad is not likely to be tempted out to meet them, since his orders are to  hold Enslin against attack. However, should they venture to make a dash for  Enslin, they will get a pretty bad time, as the Australians there are keen  for a fight.    Concerning farming, it is an unknown quantity here, as we in Australia  understand it. These people simply squat down wherever they can find a  natural catchment for water. There is no clearing to be done, as the land  is quite devoid of timber. They put nigger labour on, and build a  farmhouse. These farmhouses are much better built than those which the  average pioneer farmer in Australia owns. They make no attempt at  adornment, but build plain, substantial houses, containing mostly about six  rooms. The roofs are mostly flat, and the frontages plain to ugliness. They  do no fencing, except where they go in for ostrich breeding. When they farm  for"]]]
