At the same time he was not a conceited sort of a chap and didn't seem  to realize that he was head and shoulders above the rest of us in  ingenuity. But, of course, we didn't all have an uncle like Bill did.  Bill's Uncle Ed was one of those rare men who take a great interest in  boys and their affairs, a man who took time to answer every question put  to him, explaining everything completely and yet so clearly that you  caught on at once. Uncle Ed (we all called him that) was a civil  engineer of very high standing in his profession, which had taken him  pretty much all over the world, and his naturally inquisitive nature,  coupled with a wonderful memory, had made him a veritable walking  encyclopedia. With such an uncle it is no wonder that Bill knew  everything. Of course, there were some things that puzzled even Bill.  But all such difficulties, after a reasonable amount of brain-work had  failed to clear them, were submitted to Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed was always  prompt (that was one thing we liked about him), and no matter where he  was or what he was doing he would drop everything to answer a letter  from the society.      THE OLD TRUNK.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. The Old Trunk in the Attic.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2. The Black Walnut Box.]    But hold on, I am getting ahead of my story. I was rummaging through the  attic the other day, and came across an old battered trunk, one that I  used when I went to boarding-school down in south Jersey. That trunk was  certainly a curiosity shop. It contained a miscellaneous assortment of  glass tubes, brass rods, coils of wire, tools, fish hooks--in fact, it  was a typical collection of all those \"valuables\" that a boy is liable  to pick up. Down in one corner of the trunk was a black walnut box,  marked, with brass letters, \"Property of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I.\"  On my key-ring I still carried the key to that box, which had not been  opened for years. I unlocked the box and brought to light the \"Records  and Chronicles of the Society for the Scientific Investigation,  Exploration and Exploitation of Willow Clump Island.\" For hours I pored  over those pages, carried back to the good old times we used to have as  boys along the banks of the Delaware River, until I was brought sharply  back to the present by the sound of the dinner bell. It seemed that the  matter contained in those \"Chronicles\" was too good to be kept locked up  in an old trunk. Few boys' clubs ever had such a president as Bill, or  such a wonderful bureau of information as Uncle Ed. For the benefit of  boys and boykind in general, I decided then and there to publish, as  fully as practicable, a record of what our society did.      CHRISTMAS VACATION.    This was how the society came to be formed. Bill, whom I met at  boarding-school, was an orphan, and that's why he was sent to  boarding-school. His uncle had to go down to Brazil to lay out a  railroad, I believe, and so he packed Bill off to our school, which was  chosen in preference to some others because one of the professors there  had been a classmate of Uncle Ed's at college. Bill roomed with me, and  naturally we became great chums. When Christmas time came, of course I  invited him to spend the holidays with me. My home was situated in the  little village of Lamington, on the Jersey side of the Delaware River.  Here we arrived late at night on the Saturday before Christmas. A cold  wind was blowing which gave promise of breaking the spell of warm  weather we had been having, and of giving us a chance to try our skates  for the first time. True to our expectations, the next day was bitterly  cold, and a visit to the canal which ran along the river bank, just  beyond our back fence, showed that quite a thick skim of ice had formed  on the water. Monday morning, bright and early, found us on the smooth,  slippery surface of the canal. \"Us\" here includes, in addition to Bill  and myself, my two younger brothers, Jack and Fred, and also Dutchy Van  Syckel and Reddy Schreiner, neighbors of ours. It was the custom at the  first of December every year to drain out most of the water in the  canal, in order to prevent possible injury to the canal banks from the  pressure of the ice. But there was always a foot or two of water  covering the bottom of the canal, and this afforded a fine skating park  of ample width and unlimited length, while the high canal banks on each  side protected us from the bitter wind that was blowing. Toward noon,  however, the wind shifted and swept at a terrific rate down the narrow  lane between the canal banks. We could scarcely make headway against the  blow. It was too much for Bill, who wasn't as used to skating as we  were. He sat down in a sheltered nook and commenced to think. When Bill  sat down to think it always meant that something was going to happen, as  we soon learned.    \"Say, Jim,\" said he to me, \"have you got any canvas up at the house?\"    \"No,\" I replied. \"What do you want it for?\"    \"I want to rig up a skate sail. If you have an old sheet, that will do  just as well.\"    \"Well, I guess I can find you an old sheet. Do you think you can make  one?\"    \"Sure thing,\" answered Bill, and off we went to the house, where I  received my first lesson on the practical genius of my chum.      \"BILL'S\" SKATE SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Laying Out the Sail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4. The Tape Tie Strings.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5. \"Bill's\" Sail Complete.]    The old sheet which Mother furnished us was laid out on the floor and  two corners were folded over to the center, as shown in the drawing,  making a triangle with base 7 feet long and sides each about 4 feet 6  inches long. The surplus end piece was then cut off, and a broad hem  turned and basted all around the edges of the triangle. Bill wanted to  work the sewing machine himself, but Mother was afraid he would break  something, so she sewed down the hem for us. Then, under Bill's  supervision, she re-enforced the corners by sewing on patches of cloth.  Along the diagonal a strip of heavy tape was sewed, leaving loops at  intervals, which afterward were cut and provided means for tying the  sail to the mast. Tie strings of tape were also sewed at the corners, as  shown in the illustration, and then a trip was made to the garden in  search of suitable spars. A smooth bean pole of about the right weight  served for the mast, and another stick with a crotch at one end served  as the boom or cross-spar. The spars were cut to proper length, and the  sail was then tied on, as illustrated, with the crotch of the cross-spar  fitted against and tied to the center of the mast. A light rope, long  enough to provide plenty of slack, was tied to the ends of the mast to  assist in guiding the sail when in use. In the meantime I had procured  another sheet from one of our neighbors, and Bill helped me make a sail  for myself. It was not until long after dark that we finished our work.      WILLOW CLUMP ISLAND.    The next day we tried the sails and it didn't take me very long to learn  how to steer the device. The wind had changed again and this time blew  up the canal. We took the line of least resistance, and went skimming up  the ice lane like birds for several miles before we realized how far we  were getting away from home. As we rounded a bend in the canal, much to  my astonishment, I saw just before us the bridge at Raven Hill, eight  miles from our town. We started to go back, but the wind was too strong  for us, and there wasn't much room in which to do any tacking; nor could  we make any progress when the sails were folded. I began to get  extremely tired and rather exasperated at Bill for not having thought of  the return trip before he led me such a hot pace up the canal. But Bill  was getting tired, too.    \"Look here, Jim,\" he said, \"we haven't covered a mile, and I'm worn  out.\"    \"Why in thunder didn't you think of this before we started?\" I returned.    \"How much money have you with you?\" was the reply.    \"What's that got to do with it?\"    \"I'll tell you in a minute. How much have you?\"    A careful search of my dozen odd pockets netted the sum of twenty-seven  cents.    \"I have fifty-nine,\" said Bill, \"and that makes eighty-six altogether,  doesn't it? Isn't there a railroad depot near here?\"    \"There is one at Raven Hill, and the next is at Lumberville. That is  about eleven miles from home.\"    \"Well,\" said Bill, \"at three cents each per mile that would amount to  sixty-six cents. Let's sail on to Lumberville and then take the train  back.\"    On we sped to Lumberville, only to find that the next train was not due  until noon, and it was now just half past ten.    Time never hung heavy on our hands. Out on the river we espied an  island. I had heard of this island--Willow Clump Island, it was  called--but had never been on it; consequently I fell in with Bill's  suggestion that we make it a visit. Owing to the rapids which separated  the island from the Jersey shore, we had to go up stream a quarter of a  mile, to where a smooth sheet of ice had formed, over a quiet part of  the river; thence we sailed down to the island along the Pennsylvania  side.    \"What a capital island for a camp,\" cried Bill, after we had explored it  pretty thoroughly. \"Have you ever been out camping?\"    I had to confess I never had, and then Bill gave me a glowing account of  his experiences in the Adirondacks with his uncle the year before, which  so stirred up the romance in me that I wanted to camp out at once.    \"Shucks!\" said Bill, \"We would freeze in this kind of weather, and  besides, we've got to make a tent first.\"    We then sat down and made elaborate plans for the summer. Suddenly the  distant sound of a locomotive whistle interrupted our reveries.    \"Jiminy crickets!\" I exclaimed. \"That's the train coming through  Spalding's Cut. We've got to hustle if we are to catch it.\"    We were off like the wind, and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#2)"],[1," granny will be still more vexed. I have had my heart's desire, and  because things are not quite so pleasant as I hoped they would have  been, it is no reason why I should be discontented.\"    The next moment she had lifted the latch at a small cottage and entered.  It was a little better than a workman's house, but not much; there were  two rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs, and that was all. To the  front of the little house was the tiny parlour, at the back an equally  tiny kitchen. Upstairs was a bedroom for Ruth and a bedroom for her  grandparents. Mr. and Mrs. Craven did not keep any servants. The moment  Ruth entered now her grandmother put her head out of the kitchen door.    \"Ruthie,\" she said, \"the butcher has disappointed us to-day. Here is a  shilling; go to the shop and bring in some sausages. Be as quick as you  can, child, or your grandfather won't have his supper in time.\"    Ruth took the money without a word. She went down a small lane, turned  to her right, and found herself in a mean little street full of small  shops. She entered one that she knew, and asked for a pound and a half  of pork sausages. As the woman was wrapping them up in a piece of torn  newspaper, she looked at Ruth and said:    \"Is it true, Miss Craven, that you are a scholar at the Great Shirley  School?\"    \"I am,\" replied Ruth. \"I went there for the first time to-day.\"    \"So your grandparents are going to educate you, miss, as if you were a  lady.\"    \"I am a lady, Mrs. Plowden. My grandparents cannot make me anything but  what I am.\"    Mrs. Plowden smiled. She handed Ruth her sausages without a word, and  the young girl left the shop. Her grandmother was waiting for her in the  porch.    \"What a time you have been, child!\" she said. \"I do hope this new school  and the scholars and all this fuss and excitement of your new life won't  turn your head. Whatever happens, you have got to be a little servant to  me and a little messenger to your grandfather. You have got to make  yourself useful, and not to have ideas beyond your station.\"    \"Here are the sausages, granny,\" answered Ruth in a gentle tone.    The old lady took them from her and disappeared into the kitchen.    \"Ruth--Ruth!\" said a somewhat querulous but very deep voice which  evidently issued from the parlor.    \"Yes, granddad; coming in a moment or two,\" Ruth replied. She ran up  the tiny stairs, and entered her own little bedroom, which was so wee  that she could scarcely turn round in it, but was extremely neat.    Ruth removed her hat, brushed out her black hair, saw that her dress,  shabby as it was, was in apple-pie order, put on a neat white apron, and  ran downstairs. She first of all entered the parlor. A handsome old man,  with a decided look of Ruth herself, was seated by the fire. He was  holding out his thin, knuckly hands to the blaze. As Ruth came in he  turned and smiled at her.    \"Ah, deary!\" he said, \"I have been missing you all day. And how did you  like your school? And how is everything?\"    \"I will tell you after supper, grandfather. I must go and help granny  now.\"    \"That's right; that's a good girl. Oh! far be it from me to be  impatient; I wouldn't be for all the world. Your granny has missed you  too to-day.\"    Ruth smiled at him and went into the kitchen. There were eager voices  and sounds of people hurrying about, and then a fragrant smell of fried  sausages. A moment later Ruth appeared, holding a brightly trimmed lamp  in her hand; she laid it on a little centre-table, drew down the blinds,  pulled the red curtains across the windows, poked up the fire, and then  proceeded to lay the cloth for supper. Her pile of books, which she had  brought in her satchel, lay on a chair.    \"I can have a look at your books while I am waiting, can't I, little  woman?\" said the old man.    Ruth brought him over the pack of books somewhat unwillingly. He gave a  sigh of contentment, drew the lamp a little nearer, and was lost for the  time being.    \"Now, child,\" said old Mrs. Craven, \"you heat that plate by the fire.  Have you got the pepper and salt handy? Sausages ain't worth touching  unless you eat them piping hot. Your grandfather wants his beer. Dear,  dear! What a worry that is! I never knew that the cask was empty. What  is to be done?\"    \"I can go round to the shop and bring in a quart,\" said Ruth.    \"But you--a member of the Shirley School! No, you mustn't. I'll do it.\"    \"Nonsense, granny! I'll leave school to-morrow if you don't let me work  for you just the same as ever.\"    Mrs. Craven sank into her chair.    \"You are a good child,\" she said. \"All day I have been so fretting that  we were taking you out of your station; and that is a sad mistake--sad  and terrible. But you are a good child. Yes, go for it, dear; it won't  do you any harm.\"    Ruth wrapped an old shawl round her head, picked up a jug, and went off  to the nearest public-house. They were accustomed to see her there, for  old Mr. Craven more often than not had his little cask of beer empty.  She went to a side entrance, where a woman she knew served her with what  she required.    \"There, Ruth Craven,\" she said--\"there it is. But, all the same, I'm  surprised to see you here to-night.\"    \"But why so?\" asked Ruth.    \"Isn't it true that you are one of the Shirley scholars now?\"    \"I am; I joined the school to-day.\"    \"And yet you come to fetch beer for your old grandfather!\"    \"I do,\" said Ruth, with spirit. \"And I shall fetch it for him as long as  he wants it. Thank you very much.\"    She took the jug and walked carefully back to the cottage.    \"She's the handsomest, most spirited, best little thing I ever met,\"  thought the landlady of the \"Lion,\" and she began to consider in her own  mind if one of her men could not call round in the morning and leave the  necessary beer at the Cravens'.    Supper was served, and was eaten with considerable relish by all three.    \"Now,\" said old granny when the meal had come to an end, \"you stay and  talk to your grandfather--he is all agog to hear what you have got to  say--and I will wash up. Now then, child, don't you worry. It isn't  everybody who has got loving grandparents like us.\"    \"And it isn't many old bodies who have got such a dear little  granddaughter,\" said the old man, smiling at Ruth.    Mrs. Craven carried the supper things into the kitchen, and Ruth sat  close to her grandfather.    \"Now, tell me, child, tell me,\" he said. \"What did they do? What class  did they put you into?\"    \"I am in the third remove; a very good class indeed--at least they all  said so, grandfather.\"    \"I don't understand your modern names; but tell me what you have got to  learn, dear. What sort of lessons are they going to put into that smart  little head of yours?\"    \"Oh, all the best things, grandfather--French, German, English in all  its branches, music, and Latin if I like. I am determined to take up  Latin; I want to get to the heart of things.\"    \"Quite right--quite right, too. And you are ever so pleased at having  got in?\"    \"It does seem a grand thing for me, doesn't it, grandfather?\"    \"Most of the girls are ladies, aren't they?\"    \"It is a big school--between three and four hundred girls. I don't  suppose they are all ladies.\"    \"Well, you are, anyhow, my little Ruth.\"    \"Am I, granddad? That is the question.\"    \"What do you think yourself?\"    \"I think so; but what does the world say?\"    \"Ruth, I never told you, but your mother was a lady. You know what your  father was. I saved and stinted and toiled and got him a commission in  the army. He died, poor fellow, shortly after you were born. But he was  a commissioned officer in the Punjab Infantry. Your mother was a  governess, but she was a lady by birth; her father was a clergyman. Your  parents met in India; they fell in love, and married. Your mother died  at your birth, and you came home to us. Yes, child, by birth you are a  lady, as good as any of them--as good as the best.\"    \"They are dead,\" said Ruth. \"I don't remember them. I have a picture of  my father upstairs; it is taken with his uniform on. He looks very  handsome. And I have a little water-color sketch of my mother, and she  looks fair and sweet and interesting. But I never knew them. Those I  knew and know and love are you, grandfather, and granny.\"    \"Well, dear, when I had the power and the brains and the strength, I  kept a shop--a grocer's shop, dear; and my wife, she was the daughter of  a harness-maker. Your grandparents were both in trade; there's no way  out of it.\"    \"But a gentleman and lady for all that,\" said the girl.    She pressed close to the old man, took one of his weather-beaten hands  between both of her own, and stroked it.    \"That is as people think, Ruthie; but we weren't in the position, and  never expect to be, of those who are high up in the world.\"    \"I am glad you told me about my father and mother,\" said the girl. \"I  love both their memories. I am glad to think that my father served the  Queen, and that my mother was the daughter of a clergyman. But I am more  glad to think that there never was such an honorable man as you,  granddad, and that you made the grocery trade one of the best in the  world.\"    \"It was a bad trade, my darling. I had several severe losses. It was  very unfortunate my lending that money.\"    \"What money?\"    \"Oh, I will tell you another time; it doesn't really matter. There was a  little bit of ingratitude there, but it doesn't matter. Only I made no  fortune by grocery--barely enough to put my boy into the army and to  educate him for it, and enough to keep us with a pittance now that we  are old. But I have nothing to leave you, sweetest. You just have your  pension from the Government, which don't count for nothing at all.\"    Ruth rose to her feet.    \"I am glad I got into the school,\" she said. \"I hope to do wonders  there. I mean to take every scrap of good the place opens out to me. I  mean to work as hard "]]]
