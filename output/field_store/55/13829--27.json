The incessant rattle of the ships' machine  guns was also heard in the intervals between the thundering broadsides  of heavy ordnance. All the ships were, of course, cleared for action,  with topmasts and yards sent down, and it is needless to say they  looked exceedingly workmanlike and formidable.    The various batteries on the Rock replied with great vivacity, and the  general effect produced as gun after gun was brought to bear on the  ships, and the white smoke wreathed itself round the many crags and  precipices of the grim old Rock, was a sight long to be remembered.  The exercise afforded to both branches of the service was undoubtedly  most instructive. Our illustration is a sketch by Captain Willoughby  Verner from one of the batteries above the Europa Flats, at which  point the governor took up his position to watch the operations.  --_Illustrated London News._           *       *       *       *       *          GIBRALTAR AND NEIGHBORHOOD.    REPORT BY CONSUL SPRAGUE.      Notwithstanding that the political situation of Europe seems to be  less threatening among its leading powers, still the uncertainty  prevalent among those who are generally considered the arbiters of  public affairs has had its influence in contracting the limits of  speculative adventure, thereby circumscribing the general course of  trade throughout the Mediterranean.    In renewing to the department my reports upon the navigation and  general commerce of Gibraltar, I beg to state that there has been a  tolerably fair current business prevailing in American produce during  the past quarter, consisting chiefly in flour, tobacco, and refined  petroleum in cases, imported direct from New York.    The steady demand for American petroleum confirms the fact that  Russian petroleum so far receives but little attention in this market  from the regular traders and consumers, so long as supplies from the  United States can be regularly imported at reasonable prices. It,  however, remains an open question, in the event of lower prices ruling  in the Russian petroleum regions, whether American supplies may not  later on experience some greater competitive foreign interference.    According to the statistical data, steam vessels of all nationalities  have continued to make Gibraltar their port of call, not only for  orders, but also for replenishing their stock of fuel and provisions,  and in larger numbers than ever before, the number in 1888 having  reached 5,712 steam vessels, measuring in all 5,969,563 tons, while in  1887 the number was only 5,187 steam vessels, with an aggregate  tonnage of 5,372,962. This increase cannot but result in considerable  benefit to the coal and maritime traffic, which now forms the most  important portion of the general commerce of Gibraltar, in spite of  the keen competition it experiences from other British and foreign  coaling ports.    Freights have also advanced in favor of steamship interests, which,  with higher prices in England for coal, have also caused an advance in  the price of coal at this port, to the benefit of the coal merchants  and others interested in this important trade. At present the ruling  price for steam coal is 24s. per ton, deliverable from alongside of  coal hulks moored in the bay. As near as I have been able to  ascertain, the quantity of coal sold in this market during the past  year for supplying merchant steam vessels has amounted to about  508,000 tons, which is an increase of about 20,000 tons over the year  1887.    Notwithstanding that plans have already been submitted to the British  government for the construction of a dry dock in Gibraltar, the matter  remains somewhat in suspense, since it meets with some opposition on  the part of the British government, which, in face of the European  fever for general arming, seems more inclined to utilize in another  form the expense which such a work would entail upon the imperial  government, by replacing the obsolete ordnance recently removed from  this fortress and substituting new defenses and guns of the most  approved patterns, a matter which has evidently been receiving, for  some time past, the special attention of the British military  authorities, not doubting that the recent visit to the fortress of the  Duke of Cambridge has had some connection with it. In fact, it is  reported that the duke has already expressed the opinion that this  fortress requires a larger number of artillerymen than are quartered  here at present to man its batteries, and it would seem that this  recommendation is likely to be carried out.    It is yet somewhat too early to venture an opinion regarding the  growing crops of cereals in this Spanish neighborhood, but the  agricultural and manufacturing interests in Spain have suffered so  much in the past years that the general feeling in Spain continues to  tend toward establishing increased restrictions against foreign  competition in her home markets. There is every probability that the  provinces of Malaga and Granada may shortly be granted the privilege  of cultivating the tobacco plant under government supervision, as an  essay. If properly managed, it may form an important and lucrative  business for those interested in land and agricultural pursuits.    After many consecutive years of heavy outlays, difficulties, and  constant disappointments, a new English company has recently succeeded  in commencing the construction of a railway from the neighboring  Spanish town of Algeciras to join, via Ronda, the railway station of  Bobadilla, on the railroad line toward Malaga. It is presumed that  when this railroad will be in running order it will greatly benefit  this community, especially if the Spanish government should decide to  establish custom houses at Algeciras and the Spanish lines outside the  gates of this fortress, similar to those existing on the frontiers of  France and Portugal.    That some idea may be formed of the constant important daily  intercourse which exists between this fortress and Spain, I may state  that late police statistics show that 1,887,617 passes were issued to  visitors entering this fortress on daily permits during the year 1888,  1,608,004 entering by the land route and 279,613 by sea. I must,  however, observe that the larger portion of these visitors consists of  laborers, coal heavers, market people, and others engaged in general  traffic.    A new industry in cork has lately sprung up, in which leading Spanish  and native commercial firms in Gibraltar are directly interested to a  considerable extent. Extensive warehouses for the storing of cork wood  and machinery for the manufacture of bottle corks have recently been  established at the Spanish lines, about a mile distant from this  fortress, in Spanish territory, where large quantities of cork have  already been stored. The cork is obtained and collected from the  valuable trees, which are owned by the representatives of some of the  oldest nobility of Spain, who have sold the products of their  extensive woods to private individuals for periods reaching as far on  as ten years, for which concession large cash advances have already  been made. The woods commence at a distance of about twelve miles from  Gibraltar, and are of considerable extent.    The railway now in course of construction passes through these woods,  which may ere long offer quite picturesque scenery for travelers,  especially when the cork trees are bearing acorns, which form the  principal food for the fattening of large herds of swine during  certain seasons of the year, in this way, also, contributing to the  value of this tree, which, like the other kinds of oak trees, is of  long and tardy growth. The tree from which the cork is obtained is  somewhat abundant in the mountainous districts of Andalusia. It grows  to a height of about 30 feet, and resembles the _Quercus ilex_, or  evergreen oak, and attains to a great age. After arriving at a certain  state of maturity it periodically sheds its bark, but this bark is  found to be of better quality when artificially removed from the tree,  which may be effected without injury to the tree itself. After the  tree has attained twenty-five years it may be barked, and the  operation is afterward repeated once in every seven years. The quality  of the cork seems to improve with the increasing age of the tree,  which is said to live over one hundred and fifty years. The bark is  taken off during July and August.    Cork dust is also obtained from this cork wood, and is much used in  the packing of grapes, which fruit is largely shipped from the eastern  coast of Spain, especially from Almeria, during the vintage seasons,  for the American and British markets.--_Reports of U.S. Consuls._           *       *       *       *       *          GIBRALTAR.      The point or rock known as Gibraltar is a promontory two and one-half  miles long and from a quarter to three-quarters of a mile wide. It  rises abruptly from the sandy shore to a height at its highest point  of 1,408 ft. It is composed of gray limestone, honeycombed with caves  and subterranean passages, some of which contain most beautiful  stalactites in the form of massive pillars.    Gibraltar is emphatically a fortress, and in some respects its  fortifications are unique. On the eastern side the rock needs no  defense beyond its own precipitous cliffs, and in all other directions  it has been rendered practically impregnable. Besides a sea wall  extending at intervals round the western base of the rock, and  strengthened by curtains and bastions and three formidable forts,  there are batteries in all available positions from the sea wall up to  the summit, 1,350 feet above the sea, and a remarkable series of  galleries has been hewn out of the solid face of the rock toward the  north and northwest. These galleries have an aggregate length of  between two and three miles, and their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#2)"],[1," He exhorted them, the fiercer waxed the envy and waywardness  of the people, except those who wholly detached themselves from all save  God, and ascended on the wings of certainty to the station which God hath  exalted beyond the comprehension of men. It is well known what a host of  enemies besieged Him, until at last the fires of envy and rebellion were  kindled against Him. And after the episode of the fire came to pass, He,  the lamp of God amongst men, was, as recorded in all books and chronicles,  expelled from His city.    And when His day was ended, there came the turn of Moses. Armed with the  rod of celestial dominion, adorned with the white hand of divine  knowledge, and proceeding from the Paran of the love of God, and wielding  the serpent of power and everlasting majesty, He shone forth from the  Sinai of light upon the world. He summoned all the peoples and kindreds of  the earth to the kingdom of eternity, and invited them to partake of the  fruit of the tree of faithfulness. Surely you are aware of the fierce  opposition of Pharaoh and his people, and of the stones of idle fancy  which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed Tree. So much so that  Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their utmost endeavor to  extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial the fire of that sacred  Tree, oblivious of the truth that no earthly water can quench the flame of  divine wisdom, nor mortal blasts extinguish the lamp of everlasting  dominion. Nay, rather, such water cannot but intensify the burning of the  flame, and such blasts cannot but ensure the preservation of the lamp,  were ye to observe with the eye of discernment, and walk in the way of  God's holy will and pleasure. How well hath a believer of the kindred of  Pharaoh, whose story is recounted by the All-Glorious in His Book revealed  unto His beloved One, observed: \"And a man of the family of Pharaoh who  was a believer and concealed his faith said: 'Will ye slay a man because  he saith my Lord is God, when He hath already come to you with signs from  your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he be a man of  truth, part of what he threateneth will fall upon you. In truth God  guideth not him who is a transgressor, a liar.'\"(9) Finally, so great was  their iniquity that this self-same believer was put to a shameful death.  \"The curse of God be upon the people of tyranny.\"(10)    And now, ponder upon these things. What could have caused such contention  and conflict? Why is it that the advent of every true Manifestation of God  hath been accompanied by such strife and tumult, by such tyranny and  upheaval? This notwithstanding the fact that all the Prophets of God,  whenever made manifest unto the peoples of the world, have invariably  foretold the coming of yet another Prophet after them, and have  established such signs as would herald the advent of the future  Dispensation. To this the records of all sacred books bear witness. Why  then is it that despite the expectation of men in their quest of the  Manifestations of Holiness, and in spite of the signs recorded in the  sacred books, such acts of violence, of oppression and cruelty, should  have been perpetrated in every age and cycle against all the Prophets and  chosen Ones of God? Even as He hath revealed: \"As oft as an Apostle cometh  unto you with that which your souls desire not, ye swell with pride,  accusing some of being impostors and slaying others.\"(11)    Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? What could have  prompted such behaviour towards the Revealers of the beauty of the  All-Glorious? Whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial  and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the  people of this age. To maintain that the testimony of Providence was  incomplete, that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the  people, is but open blasphemy. How far from the grace of the All-Bountiful  and from His loving providence and tender mercies it is to single out a  soul from amongst all men for the guidance of His creatures, and, on one  hand, to withhold from Him the full measure of His divine testimony, and,  on the other, inflict severe retribution on His people for having turned  away from His chosen One! Nay, the manifold bounties of the Lord of all  beings have, at all times, through the Manifestations of His divine  Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein. Not for a  moment hath His grace been withheld, nor have the showers of His  loving-kindness ceased to rain upon mankind. Consequently, such behaviour  can be attributed to naught save the petty-mindedness of such souls as  tread the valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of  remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and follow the dictates  of the leaders of their faith. Their chief concern is mere opposition;  their sole desire is to ignore the truth. Unto every discerning observer  it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of  the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sanctified their eyes, their ears,  and their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely  would not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed  far from the habitations of glory. But having weighed the testimony of God  by the standard of their own knowledge, gleaned from the teachings of the  leaders of their faith, and found it at variance with their limited  understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts.    Leaders of religion, in every age, have hindered their people from  attaining the shores of eternal salvation, inasmuch as they held the reins  of authority in their mighty grasp. Some for the lust of leadership,  others through want of knowledge and understanding, have been the cause of  the deprivation of the people. By their sanction and authority, every  Prophet of God hath drunk from the chalice of sacrifice, and winged His  flight unto the heights of glory. What unspeakable cruelties they that  have occupied the seats of authority and learning have inflicted upon the  true Monarchs of the world, those Gems of divine virtue! Content with a  transitory dominion, they have deprived themselves of an everlasting  sovereignty. Thus, their eyes beheld not the light of the countenance of  the Well-Beloved, nor did their ears hearken unto the sweet melodies of  the Bird of Desire. For this reason, in all sacred books mention hath been  made of the divines of every age. Thus He saith: \"O people of the Book!  Why disbelieve the signs of God to which ye yourselves have been  witnesses?\"(12) And also He saith: \"O people of the Book! Why clothe ye  the truth with falsehood? Why wittingly hide the truth?\"(13) Again, He  saith: \"Say, O people of the Book! Why repel believers from the way of  God?\"(14) It is evident that by the \"people of the Book,\" who have  repelled their fellow-men from the straight path of God, is meant none  other than the divines of that age, whose names and character have been  revealed in the sacred books, and alluded to in the verses and traditions  recorded therein, were you to observe with the eye of God.    With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a  while the horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate those words of  perfection which the Eternal hath revealed, that haply the mysteries of  divine wisdom, hidden ere now beneath the veil of glory and treasured  within the tabernacle of His grace, may be made manifest unto you. The  denials and protestations of these leaders of religion have, in the main,  been due to their lack of knowledge and understanding. Those words uttered  by the Revealers of the beauty of the one true God, setting forth the  signs that should herald the advent of the Manifestation to come, they  never understood nor fathomed. Hence they raised the standard of revolt,  and stirred up mischief and sedition. It is obvious and manifest that the  true meaning of the utterances of the Birds of Eternity is revealed to  none except those that manifest the Eternal Being, and the melodies of the  Nightingale of Holiness can reach no ear save that of the denizens of the  everlasting realm. The Copt of tyranny can never partake of the cup  touched by the lips of the Sept of justice, and the Pharaoh of unbelief  can never hope to recognize the hand of the Moses of truth. Even as He  saith: \"None knoweth the meaning thereof except God and them that are  well-grounded in knowledge.\"(15) And yet, they have sought the  interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in veils, and have  refused to seek enlightenment from the fountain-head of knowledge.    And when the days of Moses were ended, and the light of Jesus, shining  forth from the dayspring of the Spirit, encompassed the world, all the  people of Israel arose in protest against Him. They clamoured that He  Whose advent the Bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfil the  laws of Moses, whereas this youthful Nazarene, who laid claim to the  station of the divine Messiah, had annulled the law of divorce and of the  sabbath day--the most weighty of all the laws of Moses. Moreover, what of  the signs of the Manifestation yet to come? These people of Israel are  even unto the present day still expecting that Manifestation which the  Bible hath foretold! How many Manifestations of Holiness, how many  Revealers of the light everlasting, have appeared since the time of Moses,  and yet Israel, wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false  imaginings, is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will  appear with such signs as she herself hath conceived! Thus hath God laid  hold of them for their sins, hath extinguished in them the spirit of  faith, and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire. And this  for no other reason except that Israel refused to apprehend the meaning of  such words"]]]
