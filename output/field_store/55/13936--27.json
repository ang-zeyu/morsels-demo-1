We could not whittle a stick nor write a letter if we had only wings.    In fact we could not do most of the things we now do.    I am glad I have my hands.    We are glad, too, that the dragon flies have their pretty, swift wings.    They have four wings, all nearly the same size and shape, you see, and  they are all stiff and shining.    Some dragon flies, like this one we have picked up, always keep their  wings spread out.    [Illustration]    But over there, standing on the end of that stick, is another kind.    When it rests its wings are folded together.    What a pretty one it is! Do you see it?    It is small, but so pretty.    It is bright blue and shines as though it had been polished.    Sometimes birds catch these smaller dragon flies, though birds, as a  rule, are not fond of any of them.    They are so hard and their wings are so stiff I should think a bird  might almost as well swallow nails.    I am sure no bird could swallow one of the big ones, wings and all!    But frogs can.    A frog will try to swallow almost anything it can catch, and it watches  for the dragon flies when they come to lay their eggs in the water.    Suddenly it jumps out, and away goes poor dragon fly into that great  wide frog-mouth.    [Illustration]    Now look at the legs of the dragon fly. It has six.    Every dragon fly has six legs.    They are rather short and small for so large an insect, but that is  because it does not need large, strong legs.    You never saw a dragon fly dig a hole, or run, or even walk, did you?    Their legs are not arranged for walking. All six of them are directed  forwards as though they were reaching out after something. And so they  are--reaching out after insects.    Dragon fly catches his prey while he is flying, and he grasps the  insects with his feet.    He snatches one, and then what?    Does he sit down somewhere and eat it?    Not he, he is far too hungry for that; he continues his swift flight,  and as he flies he eats.    As soon as he has finished one fly or gnat, zip! he snatches another.    He has an insatiable appetite, consuming hundreds of insects in the  course of a day. Nor does he confine his attention to flies and gnats  and mosquitoes and such small fry. He catches what he can. A large  dragon fly will even gorge himself on one of the large-sized  butterflies, and one has been seen calmly chewing away at an enormous  wasp!    No, indeed, Mabel, the dragon fly does not eat the wings of the  butterfly, it eats only the soft body.    Probably nothing eats a butterfly, wings and all. Birds and insects  sometimes catch butterflies, and you often see the bright wings lying on  the ground. The wings of insects are not worth eating, and are almost  always cast aside by the creatures that eat the insects.    Besides catching insects with their legs, the dragon flies cling fast to  things with them, but when they wish to move they do not walk, they fly.    Yes, indeed, Frank, you are right; their legs are jointed.    That is so they can move them easily and fold them up when they want  to.    They would find it as hard to get along without joints to their legs as  we should.    Wouldn't we be stiff if we had no joints!    See, the legs and wings are fastened to the middle part of the body, the  _thorax_, we call it.    All insects have the legs and wings attached to the thorax.    The rest of the body is the abdomen. See how long it is.    [Illustration]    It is the long abdomen that gives the dragon fly its name of spindle, I  suppose.    The abdomen is jointed, and it can curl up.    All grown-up insects have a head, a thorax, and a jointed abdomen.           *       *       *       *       *    What are you looking at, Charlie?    Something moving in the bottom of the pond?    Let us get it out.    Here, we will dip it out with this cup.    What a lot of stuff!    Sticks and mud--and--what is that?    Something alive, surely.    Let us put some clean water in the cup and examine what we have found.    My! my! what a queer little thing!    What do you suppose it is?    Ah, I know now, but I do not think you could ever, ever guess, not if  you tried a week.    It is a young dragon fly!    It does not look much like its shiny-winged parents.    It looks like I don't know what, with a face like--well, when you look  right in front of it, like a pug dog.    Queer! Well, I should think so! What is that, Amy? Am I sure it is a  dragon fly?    Yes, there is no mistake; a dragon fly one day dropped an egg in the  pond, and out of it hatched--this.    [Illustration]    It will some day become a shiny-winged dragon fly and catch mosquitoes.    We will call it larva, and we will watch it a little while.    Look and see if it has a head, a thorax, and an abdomen.    Are there antennae on its head? And has it eyes?    If you were to look at its eyes with a microscope, you would find that  they are made of six-sided facets, like the eyes of the grown-up dragon  fly.    They are compound eyes, but they are not as large as the eyes of the  grown-up dragon fly.    How many legs has it? What are its legs fastened to?    Yes, Nellie, thorax is right.    Its six legs are fastened to its thorax. I am glad you remembered  thorax.    Has it a jointed abdomen? and has it wings?    Look! did you see that?    It opened its innocent-looking face all of a sudden, just darted it out  into a long-handled spoon, with hooks at the end, and hooked up that  little grub.    Now it is holding the grub on the hooks in front of its mouth and eating  it as greedily as if it were half starved.    [Illustration]    So that is why its face looks so queer.    It is its long under lip all folded up in front like a mask that makes  it look like a pug dog.    When it pleases it darts out that lip, and any unlucky insect or snail  may fall a prey to its greedy appetite.    It is said that the larvae of some dragon flies even eat pollywogs and  small fishes.    Ned wants to know if \"larvae\" means the same as \"larva.\"    Yes, it is the plural form of the word. When we speak of only one we say  \"larva\"; when we speak of more than one, instead of saying \"larvas,\" we  say \"larvae.\"    The dragon fly larvae are terrible gluttons, and hidden under the mask  are strong jaws for chewing up their prey.    Their legs are quite large and strong, too, for they crawl about the  bottom of the pond or up the stalks of the plants.    They do not move about very fast, but they do shoot out that under lip  very, very, _very_ fast indeed, so good-by to any little live thing in  the pond that comes within reach of it.    The dragon fly larvae do not all look alike. They are different in the  different species of dragon flies, and, like the rest of us, they change  as they grow older.    Yes, May, you can keep the dragon fly larvae until they change into  dragon flies.    You must supply them with fresh water and with enough to eat.    And you must put a net over the bowl or aquarium in which you keep them,  otherwise as soon as they are able they will fly away.    How can they fly without wings?    Oh, but they are going to have wings. You know they are young dragon  flies in spite of their strange appearance.    Be sure and feed them enough, or else they will eat each other, and that  would be a pity; and be sure there are some water plants for them to  hide under and crawl upon.    You can give them a little fresh fish or a tiny bit of very fresh meat,  though they like best the living things they find in the bottom of the  pond.    [Illustration]    When the dragon fly larva first hatches it is very small and its legs  are rather long and spidery, but it eats and eats and eats,--my, how it  eats!    And it grows and grows, and one day it finds its skin too tight.    A tight skin must be rather uncomfortable.    But the larva does not care much for its skin.    It merely splits it open down the back and pulls itself out.    Perhaps you think it must be yet more uncomfortable to be without a  skin.    But it is not without a skin. It is covered by a new and soft one that  soon hardens, and that is larger than the old one.    It wriggles out of its old skin as though it were an old coat, and  leaves it clinging to the weeds in the pond.    Sometime you may find these cast-off dragon fly overcoats.    After it has shed its skin the dragon fly continues to grow. It keeps on  growing until it has outgrown its new skin.    Then what do you think it does?    Yes, Charlie, that is right, it sheds this skin too.    [Illustration]    When it sheds its skin we say it moults.    It moults several times, and at last little short wings appear. At first  it has no wings at all, you know.    Amy wonders how the larva breathes under water.    Ah, Master Ned, you are laughing too soon. You think insects do not have  to breathe, but you are very much mistaken, sir.    Insects do have to breathe.    They would die if they could get no air to breathe.    Some of the dragon fly larvae have an odd arrangement for breathing under  water. They have a sort of syringe in the end of the body, and there are  breathing pores or gills in the syringe.    The water goes in and out of this syringe, and the larva breathes as the  fish does, by means of its gills.    Yes, May, its gills are in its syringe, which seems very odd,--you see  the dragon fly larva breathes at its tail end instead of at its head  end.    Mollie thinks it is an upside-down, inside-out sort of a creature  anyway. But it knows what it is about.    Ned wants to know how it can get any air to breathe when it lives under  water.    The truth is, there is always air mixed in with water, and it is this  air the larva breathes when the water goes in and out of the syringe.    It uses the syringe for another purpose too. When it pleases it can  shoot out the water with great force, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#2)"],[1,"no  effort to conceal his discontent, and thus squabbles frequently  occurred. Then the Vleeschkorporaal, fully convinced of his own  uprightness, would let his tongue go, and the burgher who had complained  was a man to be pitied. But such quarrels only occurred early in the  campaign. By the time that the Vleeschkorporaal had been a few weeks at  his work he had gained a considerable knowledge of human nature, and the  injustice of his fellows no longer troubled him. Accordingly he allowed  the complaints of the men to go in at one ear and at once to come out at  the other. The burghers, too, soon became convinced of the foolishness  of their conduct, and learnt the lesson of content and forbearance.    As I have already stated, the burgher had to boil or roast his own meat.  The roasting was done on a spit cut in the shape of a fork, the wood  being obtained from a branch of the nearest tree. A more ambitious fork  was manufactured from fencing wire, and had sometimes even as many as  four prongs. A skillful man would so arrange the meat on his spit as to  have alternate pieces of fat and of lean, and thus get what we used to  call a _bout span_.[3]    The burghers utilized the flour supplied to them in making cakes; these  they cooked in boiling fat, and called them _stormjagers_[4] or  _maagbommen_.[5]    Later on, the British, finding that by looting our cattle they could get  fresh meat for nothing, were no longer forced to be content with  bully-beef. They then, like ourselves, killed oxen and sheep; but,  unlike us, were very wasteful with it. Often, in the camping places they  had vacated, we found the remains of half-eaten oxen, sheep, pigs, and  poultry.    But I shall not go further into this matter. I leave it to other pens to  describe how the British looted our property, wantonly killed our  cattle, and devastated our farms. In the course of this narrative my  intention is to mention only those cases which I saw with my own eyes.  The reader, perusing them, may well pause in surprise and cry out, \"Can  such things be possible?\" To such a question I have only one  answer--\"They actually occurred, and so my only course is to record  them.\"    But enough of these digressions. Let me return to my proper subject--the  story of my own experiences and doings in the great struggle which took  place between Boer and Briton.    As I have already said, I had been commandeered, and, together with the  other burghers of the Heilbron commando, had just reached Harrismith, on  the road to the south-eastern frontier.    During our stay there the other commandos, in obedience to Commando Law,  joined us, and we proceeded to elect a Commander-in-Chief. The  Commandants present were Steenekamp, of Heilbron; Anthonie Lombaard, of  Vrede; C.J. De Villiers, of Harrismith; Hans Nande, of Bethlehem;  Marthinus Prinsloo, of Winburg; and C. Nel, of Kroonstad. The result of  the voting was that Prinsloo was chosen for the supreme command.    Then the burghers of Winburg selected Mr. Theunissen as their  Commandant. He fulfilled his duties admirably, until he was made a  prisoner of war. This happened when he was leading a courageous attack  at Paardeberg in order to relieve General Piet Cronje.    From Harrismith our commando advanced to within six miles of the  Natal-Free State frontier, and camped not far from Bezuidenhoutspas, in  the Drakensberg. This imposing range of mountains, which then formed the  dividing line between Boer and British territory, slopes down gently  into the Free State, but on the Natal side is very steep and  precipitous.    The day after we had elected our Commander-in-Chief I was sent by  Commandant Steenekamp, with a small detachment of burghers, to the Natal  frontier. I saw nothing of the English there, for they had abandoned all  their positions on the frontier shortly before the beginning of the war.  When I returned in the evening I found that the burghers had chosen me,  in my absence, as Vice-Commandant[6] under Commandant Steenekamp.    It was at five o'clock on the afternoon of that day--the 11th of  October, 1899--that the time, which the ultimatum allowed to England,  expired. The British had not complied with the terms which the South  African Republic demanded--the time for negotiations had passed, and war  had actually broken out.    On this very day martial law was proclaimed by the Governments of the  two Republics, and orders were given to occupy the passes on the  Drakensberg. Commander-in-Chief Prinsloo despatched Steenekamp that  night to Bezuidenhoutspas. Eastwards from there the following commandos  were to hold the passes:--Bothaspas was to be occupied by the commando  from Vrede; Van Reenen's Pass by the commandos from Harrismith and  Winburg; and Tintwaspas by the commando from Kroonstad. Westwards, the  burghers from Bethlehem were to guard Oliviershoekpas.    Commandant Steenekamp was very ill that night, and was unable to set  out; he accordingly ordered me to take his place and to proceed forward  with six hundred burghers.    Although I had only to cover six miles, it cost me considerable thought  to arrange everything satisfactorily. This was due to the fact that real  discipline did not exist among the burghers. As the war proceeded,  however, a great improvement manifested itself in this matter, although  as long as the struggle lasted our discipline was always far from  perfect. I do not intend to imply that the burghers were unwilling or  unruly; it was only that they were quite unaccustomed to being under  orders. When I look back upon the campaign I realize how gigantic a task  I performed in regulating everything in accordance with my wishes.    It did not take me long to get everything arranged, and we made an early  start.    It was impossible to say what might lie before us. In spite of the fact  that I had visited the spot the day before, I had not been able to cross  the frontier. The English might have been on the precipitous side of the  mountains under the ridge without my being any the wiser. Perhaps on our  arrival we should find them in possession of the pass, occupying good  positions and quite prepared for our coming.    Everything went well with us, however, and no untoward incident  occurred. When the sun rose the following morning the whole country, as  far as the eye could reach, lay before us calm and peaceful.    I sent a full report of my doings to Commandant Steenekamp, and that  evening he himself, although still far from well, appeared with the  remaining part of the commando. He brought the news that war had started  in grim earnest. General De la Rey had attacked and captured an armoured  train at Kraaipan.    Some days after this a war council was held at Van Reenen's Pass under  Commander-in-Chief Marthinus Prinsloo. As Commandant Steenekamp, owing  to his illness, was unable to be present, I attended the council in his  place. It was decided that a force of two thousand burghers, under  Commandant C.J. De Villiers, of Harrismith, as Vice-Vechtgeneraal,[7]  should go down into Natal, and that the remaining forces should guard  the passes on the Drakensberg.    Let me say, in parenthesis, that the laws of the Orange Free State make  no allusion to the post of Vechtgeneraal. But shortly before the war  began the Volksraad had given the President the power to appoint such an  officer. At the same session the President was allowed the veto on all  laws dealing with war.    As Commandant Steenekamp was still prevented by his health from going to  the front, I was ordered, as Vice-Commandant of the Heilbron commando,  to proceed with five hundred men to Natal.    It soon became apparent that we had been sent to Natal with the object  of cutting off the English who were stationed at Dundee and  Elandslaagte. We were to be aided in our task by the Transvaalers who  were coming from Volksrust and by a party of burghers from Vrede, all  under the command of General Roch.    We did not arrive in time to be successful in this plan. That there had  been some bungling was not open to question. Yet I am unable to assert  to whom our failure was due--whether to the Commandants of the South  African Republic, or to Commander-in-Chief Prinsloo, or to Vechtgeneraal  De Villiers. For then I was merely a Vice-Commandant, who had not to  _give_ orders, but to obey them. But whoever was to blame, it is  certainly true that when, early in the morning of the 23rd of October, I  cut the line near Dundee, I discovered that the English had retreated to  Ladysmith. It was General Yule who had led them, and he gained great  praise in British circles for the exploit.    If we had only reached our destination a little sooner we should have  cut off their retreating troops and given them a very warm time. But now  that they had joined their comrades at Ladysmith, we had to be prepared  for an attack from their combined forces, and that before the  Transvaalers, who were still at Dundee, could reinforce us.    The British did not keep us long in anxiety.    At eight o'clock the following morning--the 24th of October--they came  out of Ladysmith, and the battle of Modder Spruit[8] began. With the  sole exception of the skirmish between the Harrismith burghers and the  Carabineers at Bester Station on the 18th of October, when Jonson, a  burgher of Harrismith, was killed--the earliest victim in our fight for  freedom--this was the first fighting the Free-Staters had seen.    We occupied kopjes which formed a large semicircle to the west of the  railway between Ladysmith and Dundee. Our only gun was placed on the  side of a high kop on our western wing. Our men did not number more than  a thousand--the other burghers had remained behind as a rear-guard at  Bester Station.    With three batteries of guns the English marched to the attack, the  troops leading the way, the guns some distance behind. A deafening  cannonade was opened on us by the enemy's"]]]
