The booty was enormous: 208,000  prisoners, both male and female, 7200 horses, 11,073 asses, 5230 camels,  80,100 oxen, 800,500 sheep, made their way like a gigantic horde of  emigrants to Assyria under the escort of the victorious army. Meanwhile  the Khirimmu remained defiant, and showed not the slightest intention  to submit: their strongholds had to be attacked and the inhabitants  annihilated before order could in any way be restored in the country.  The second reign of Merodach-baladan had lasted barely nine months.    The blow which ruined Merodach-baladan broke up the coalition which he  had tried to form against Assyria. Babylon was the only rallying-point  where states so remote, and such entire strangers to each other as Judah  and Elam, could enter into friendly relations and arrange a plan of  combined action. Having lost Babylon as a centre, they were once more  hopelessly isolated, and had no means of concerting measures against the  common foe: they renounced all offensive action, and waited under  arms to see how the conqueror would deal with each severally. The  most threatening storm, however, was not that which was gathering over  Palestine, even were Egypt to be drawn into open war: for a revolt of  the western provinces, however serious, was never likely to lead to  disastrous complications, and the distance from Pelusium to the Tigris  was too great for a victory of the Pharaoh to compromise effectually  the safety of the empire. On the other hand, should intervention on the  part of Elam in the affairs of Babylon or Media be crowned with success,  the most disastrous consequences might ensue: it would mean the loss  of Karduniash, or of the frontier districts won with such difficulty by  Tiglath-pileser III. and Sargon; it would entail permanent hostilities  on the Tigris and the Zab, and perhaps the appearance of barbarian  troops under the walls of Calah or of Nineveh. Elam had assisted  Merodach-baladan, and its soldiers had fought on the plains of Kish.  Months had elapsed since that battle, yet Shutruk-nakhunta showed no  disposition to take the initiative: he accepted his defeat at all events  for the time, but though he put off the day of reckoning till a more  favourable opportunity, it argued neither weakness nor discouragement,  and he was ready to give a fierce reception to any Assyrian monarch  who should venture within his domain. Sennacherib, knowing both the  character and resources of the Elamite king, did not attempt to meet him  in the open field, but wreaked his resentment on the frontier tribes  who had rebelled at the instigation of the Elamites, on the Cossoans,  on Ellipi and its king Ishpabara. He pursued the inhabitants into the  narrow valleys and forests of the Khoatras, where his chariots were  unable to follow: proceeding with his troops, sometimes on horseback,  at other times on foot, he reduced Bit-kilamzak, Khardishpi, and  Bit-kubatti to ashes, and annexed the territories of the Cossoans and  the Yasubigalla to the prefecture of Arrapkha. Thence he entered Ellipi,  where Ishpabara did not venture to come to close quarters with him in  the open field, but led him on from town to town. He destroyed the  two royal seats of Marubishti and Akkuddu, and thirty-four of their  dependent strongholds; he took possession of Zizirtu, Kummalu, the  district of Bitbarru, and the city of Elinzash, to which he gave the  name Kar-Sennacherib,--the fortress of Sennacherib,--and annexed them  to the government of Kharkhar. The distant Medes, disquieted at his  advance, sent him presents, and renewed the assurances of devotion they  had given to Sargon, but Sennacherib did not push forward into  their territory as his predecessors had done: he was content to have  maintained his authority as far as his outlying posts, and to have  strengthened the Assyrian empire by acquiring some well-situated  positions near the main routes which led from the Iranian table-land to  the plains of Mesopotamia. Having accomplished this, he at once turned  his attention towards the west, where the spirit of rebellion was still  active in the countries bordering on the African frontier. Sabaco, now  undisputed master of Egypt, was not content, like Pionkhi, to bring  Egypt proper into a position of dependence, and govern it at a distance,  by means of his generals. He took up his residence within it, at least  during part of every year, and played the role of Pharaoh so well that  his Egyptian subjects, both at Thebes and in the Delta, were obliged to  acknowledge his sovereignty and recognise him as the founder of a  new dynasty. He kept a close watch over the vassal princes, placing  garrisons in Memphis and the other principal citadels, and throughout  the country he took in hand public works which had been almost  completely interrupted for more than a century owing to the civil wars:  the highways were repaired, the canals cleaned out and enlarged, and  the foundations of the towns raised above the level of the inundation.  Bubastis especially profited under his rule, and regained the ascendency  it had lost ever since the accession of the second Tanite dynasty; but  this partiality was not to the detriment of other cities. Several of the  temples at Memphis were restored, and the inscriptions effaced by time  were re-engraved. Thebes, happy under the government of Amenertas and  her husband Pionkhi, profited largely by the liberality of its Ethiopian  rulers. At Luxor Sabaco restored the decoration of the principal gateway  between the two pylons, and repaired several portions of the temple of  Amon at Karnak. History subsequently related that, in order to obtain  sufficient workmen, he substituted forced labour for the penalty of  death: a policy which, beside being profitable, would win for him a  reputation for clemency. Egypt, at length reduced to peace and order,  began once more to flourish, and to display that inherent vitality  of which she had so often given proof, and her reviving prosperity  attracted as of old the attention of foreign powers. At the beginning of  his reign, Sabaco had attempted to meddle in the intrigues of Syria, but  the ease with which Sargon had quelled the revolt of Ashdod had inspired  the Egyptian monarch with salutary distrust in his own power; he had  sent presents to the conqueror and received gifts in exchange, which  furnished him with a pretext for enrolling the Asiatic peoples among  the tributary nations whose names he inscribed on his triumphal lists.*  Since then he had had some diplomatic correspondence with his powerful  neighbour, and a document bearing his name was laid up in the archives  at Calah, where the clay seal once attached to it has been discovered.  Peace had lasted for a dozen years, when he died about 703 B.C., and his  son Shabitoku ascended the throne.**         * It was probably with reference to this exchange of       presents that Sabaco caused the bas-relief at Karnak to be       engraved, in which he represents himself as victorious over       both Asiatics and Africans.         ** One version of Manetho assigns twelve years to the reign       of Sabaco, and this duration is confirmed by an inscription       in Hammamat, dated in his twelfth year. Sabaco having       succeeded to the throne in 716-715 B.C., his reign brings us       down to 704 or 703 B.C., which obliges us to place the       accession of Shabi-toku in the year following the death of       Sargon.

The temporary embarrassments in which the Babylonian revolution had  plunged Sennacherib must have offered a tempting opportunity for  interference to this inexperienced king. Tyre and Judah alone of all the  Syrian states retained a sufficiently independent spirit to cherish any  hope of deliverance from the foreign yoke. Tyre still maintained her  supremacy over Southern Phoenicia, and her rulers were also kings of  Sidon.* The long reign of Eth-baal and his alliance with the kings of  Israel had gradually repaired the losses occasioned by civil discord,  and had restored Tyre to the high degree of prosperity which it had  enjoyed under Hiram. Few actual facts are known which can enlighten us  as to the activity which prevailed under Eth-baal: we know, however,  that he rebuilt the small town of Botrys, which had been destroyed in  the course of some civil war, and that he founded the city of Auza in  Libyan territory, at the foot of the mountains of Aures, in one of the  richest mineral districts of modern Algeria.**         * Eth-baal II., who, according to the testimony of the       native historians, belonged to the royal family of Tyre, is       called King of the Sidonians in the Bible (1 Kings xvi. 31),       and the Assyrian texts similarly call Elulai King of the       Sidonians, while Menander mentions him as King of Tyre. It       is probable that the King of Sidon, mentioned in the Annals       of Shal-maneser III. side by side with the King of Tyre, was       a vassal of the Tyrian monarch.         ** The two facts are preserved in a passage of Menander. I       admit the identity of the Auza mentioned in this fragment       with the Auzea of Tacitus, and with the _Colonia Septimia       Aur. Auziensium_ of the Roman inscriptions the present       Aumale.    In 876 B.C. Assur-nazir-pal had crossed the Lebanon and skirted the  shores of the Mediterranean: Eth-baal, naturally compliant, had loaded  him with gifts, and by this opportune submission had preserved his  cities and country from the horrors of invasion.*         * The King of Tyre who sent gifts to Assur-nazir-pal is not       named in the Assyrian documents: our knowledge of Tyrian       chronology permits"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"  one of his agents, named Bouiti, from the country of the far north to  oppose him; but the infant prophet immediately pronounced the formula  with which the psalm for the offering of the waters opens: \"The will of  the Lord is the rule of good!\" and proceeded to pour libations in honour  of the river Dareja, on the banks of which he had been born a moment  before, reciting at the same time the \"profession of faith which puts  evil spirits to flight.\" Bouiti fled aghast, but his master set to work  upon some fresh device. Zoroaster allowed him, however, no time to  complete his plans: he rose up, and undismayed by the malicious riddles  propounded to him by his adversary, advanced against him with his hands  full of stones--stones as large as a house--with which the good deity  supplied him. The mere sight of him dispersed the demons, and they  regained the gates of their hell in headlong flight, shrieking out, \"How  shall we succeed in destroying him? For he is the weapon which strikes  down evil beings; he is the scourge of evil beings.\" His infancy  and youth were spent in constant disputation with evil spirits: ever  assailed, he ever came out victorious, and issued more perfect from each  attack. When he was thirty years old, one of the good spirits, Vohumano,  appeared to him, and conducted him into the presence of Ahura-mazda,  the Supreme Being. When invited to question the deity, Zoroaster asked,  \"Which is the best of the creatures which are upon the earth?\" The  answer was, that the man whose heart is pure, he excels among his  fellows. He next desired to know the names and functions of the angels,  and the nature and attributes of evil. His instruction ended, he crossed  a mountain of flames, and underwent a terrible ordeal of purification,  during which his breast was pierced with a sword, and melted lead poured  into his entrails without his suffering any pain: only after this ordeal  did he receive from the hands of Ahura-mazda the Book of the Law, the  Avesta, was then sent back to his native land bearing his precious  burden. At that time, Vishtaspa, son of Aurvataspa, was reigning over  Bactria. For ten years Zoroaster had only one disciple, his cousin  Maidhyoi-Maonha, but after that he succeeded in converting, one  after the other, the two sons of Hvogva, the grand vizir Jamaspa, who  afterwards married the prophet's daughter, and Frashaoshtra, whose  daughter Hvogvi he himself espoused; the queen, Hutaosa, was the next  convert, and afterwards, through her persuasions, the king Vishtaspa  himself became a disciple. The triumph of the good cause was hastened by  the result of a formal disputation between the prophet and the wise men  of the court: for three days they essayed to bewilder him with their  captious objections and their magic arts, thirty standing on his right  hand and thirty on his left, but he baffled their wiles, aided by grace  from above, and having forced them to avow themselves at the end of  their resources, he completed his victory by reciting the Avesta before  them. The legend adds, that after rallying the majority of the people  round him, he lived to a good old age, honoured of all men for his  saintly life. According to some accounts, he was stricken dead by  lightning,* while others say he was killed by a Turanian soldier,  Bratrok-resh, in a war against the Hyaonas.         * This is, under very diverse forms, the version preferred       by Western historians of the post-classical period.    The question has often been asked whether Zoroaster belongs to  the domain of legend or of history. The only certain thing we know  concerning him is his name; all the rest is mythical, poetic, or  religious fiction. Classical writers attributed to him the composition  or editing of all the writings comprised in Persian literature: the  whole consisted, they said, of two hundred thousand verses which had  been expounded and analysed by Hermippus in his commentaries on the  secret doctrines of the Magi. The Iranians themselves averred that he  had given the world twenty-one volumes--the twenty-one _Nasks_ of the  Avesta,* which the Supreme Deity had created from the twenty-one words  of the Magian profession of faith, the _Ahuna Vairya_. King Vishtaspa is  said to have caused two authentic copies of the Avesta--which contained  in all ten or twelve hundred chapters**--to be made, one of which  was consigned to the archives of the empire, the other laid up in  the treasury of a fortress, either Shapigan, Shizigan, Samarcand, or  Persepolis.***         * The word _Avesta_, in Pehlevi _Apastak_, whence come the       Persian forms _avasta, osta_, is derived from the       Achaemenian word _Abasta_, which signifies _law_ in the       inscriptions of Darius. The term Zend-Avesta, commonly used       to designate the sacred book of the Persians, is incorrectly       derived from the expression _Apastac u Zend_, which in       Pehlevi designates first the law itself, and then the       translation and commentary in more modern language which       conduces to a _knowledge (Zend)_ of the law. The customary       application, therefore, of the name Zend to the language of       the Avesta is incorrect.         ** The Dinkart fixes the number of chapters at 1000, and the       Shah-Namak at 1200, written on plates of gold. According to       Masudi, the book itself and the two commentaries formed       12,000 volumes, written in letters of gold, the twenty-one       Nasks each contained 200 pages, and the whole of these       writings had been inscribed on 12,000 cow-hides.         *** The site of Shapigan or Shaspigan is unknown. J.       Darmesteter suggests that it ought to be read as _Shizigan_,       which would permit of the identification of the place with       Shiz, one of the ancient religious centres of Iran, whose       temple was visited by the Sassanids on their accession to       the throne. According to the Arda-Viraf the law was       preserved at Istakhr, or Persepolis, according to the Shah-       Namak at Samarcand in the temple of the Fire-god.    Alexander is said to have burnt the former copy: the latter, stolen by  the Greeks, is reported to have been translated into their language and  to have furnished them with all their scientific knowledge. One of the  Arsacids, Vologesus I., caused a search to be made for all the fragments  which existed either in writing or in the memory of the faithful,* and  this collection, added to in the reign of the Sassanid king, Ardashir  Babagan, by the high priest Tansar, and fixed in its present form under  Sapor I., was recognised as the religious code of the empire in the time  of Sapor II., about the fourth century of the Christian era.*** The text  is composed, as may be seen, of three distinct strata, which are by no  means equally ancient;*** one can, nevertheless, make out from it with  sufficient certainty the principal features of the religion and cult of  Iran, such as they were under the Achaemenids, and perhaps even under the  hegemony of the Medes.         * Tradition speaks simply of a King Valkash, without       specifying which of the four kings named Vologesus is       intended. James Darmesteter has given good reasons for       believing that this Valkash is Vologesus I. (50-75 A.D.),       the contemporary of Nero.         ** This is the tradition reproduced in two versions of the       Dinkart.         *** Darmesteter declares that ancient Zoroastrianism is, in       its main lines, the religion of the Median Magi, even though       he assigns the latest possible date to the composition of       the Avesta as now existing, and thinks he can discern in it       Greek, Jewish, and Christian elements.    It is a complicated system of religion, and presupposes a long period of  development. The doctrines are subtle; the ceremonial order of worship,  loaded with strict observances, is interrupted at every moment by laws  prescribing minute details of ritual,* which were only put in practice  by priests and strict devotees, and were unknown to the mass of the  faithful.         * Renan defined the Avesta as \"the Code of a very small       religious sect; it is a Talmud, a book of casuistry and       strict observance. I have difficulty in believing that the       great Persian empire, which, at least in religious matters,       professed a certain breadth of ideas, could have had a law       so strict. I think, that had the Persians possessed a sacred       book of this description, the Greeks must have mentioned       it.\"    The primitive, base of this religion is difficult to discern clearly:  but we may recognise in it most of those beings or personifications of  natural phenomena which were the chief objects of worship among all the  ancient nations of Western Asia--the stars, Sirius, the moon, the sun,  water and fire, plants, animals beneficial to mankind, such as the cow  and the dog, good and evil spirits everywhere present, and beneficent  or malevolent souls of mortal men, but all systematised, graduated, and  reduced to sacerdotal principles, according to the prescriptions of a  powerful priesthood. Families consecrated to the service of the altar  had ended, as among the Hebrews, by separating themselves from the rest  of the nation and forming a special tribe, that of the Magi, which was  the last to enter into the composition of the nation in historic times.  All the Magi were not necessarily devoted to the service of religion,  but all who did so devote themselves sprang from the Magian tribe; the  Avesta, in its oldest form, was the sacred book of the Magi, as well as  that of the priests who handed down their religious tradition under the  various dynasties, native or foreign, who bore rule over Iran.    The Creator was described as \"the whole circle of the heavens,\" \"the  most steadfast among the gods,\" for \"he clothes himself with the solid  vault of the firmament as his raiment,\" \"the most"]]]
