The very valuable Papers upon Thuggism submitted to the  Governor-General were chiefly drawn up by Sir William Sleeman, and  the department specially commissioned for this important purpose was  not only organised but worked by him. In consequence of ill-health,  however, at the end of 1836, he was compelled to resign this  appointment; but on his return to duty in February 1839, he was  nominated to the combined offices of Commissioner for the Suppression  of Thuggee and Dacoity.    In 1842 he was employed on a special mission in Bundelcund, to  inquire into the causes of the recent disturbances there, and he  remained in that district, with additional duties, as Resident at  Gwalior, from 1844 until 1849, when he was removed to the highly  important office of Resident at the Court of Lucknow. Colonel Sleeman  held his office at Gwalior in very critical times, which resulted in  hostilities and the battle of Maharajpore. But for a noble and  unselfish act he would have received this promotion at an earlier  period. The circumstance was this: Colonel Low, the Resident at that  time, hearing that his father was dangerously ill, tendered his  resignation to Lord Auckland, who immediately offered the appointment  to Colonel Sleeman. No sooner had this occurred, however, than  Colonel Low wrote to his Lordship that, since he had resigned, the  house of Gaunter and Co., of Calcutta, in which his brother was a  partner, had failed, and, in consequence, every farthing he had saved  had been swept away. Under this painful contingency be begged to  place himself in his Lordship's hands. This letter was sent by Lord  Auckland to Colonel Sleeman, who immediately wrote to Colonel Low,  begging that he would retain his situation at Lucknow. This generous  conduct of Colonel Sleeman was duly appreciated; and Lord Auckland,  on leaving India, recommended him to the particular notice of his  successor. Lord Ellenborough, who immediately appointed Colonel  Sleeman to Jhansi with an additional 1000_l_. a-year to his income.    Colonel Sleeman held the appointment of Resident at Lucknow from the  year 1849 until 1856. During this period his letters and diary show  his unwearied efforts to arrive at the best information on all points  with regard to Oude. These will enable the reader to form a just,  opinion on the highly-important subject of the annexation of this  kingdom to British India. The statements of Colonel Sleeman bear  inward evidence of his great administrative talents, his high and  honourable character, and of his unceasing endeavours to promote the  best interests of the King of Oude, so that his kingdom might have  been preserved to him. Colonel Sleeman's views were directly opposed  to annexation, as his letters clearly show.    His long and arduous career was now, however, fast drawing to a  close. So early as the summer of 1854 it became evident that the  health of General Sleeman was breaking up, and in the August of that  year he was attacked by alarming illness. \"Forty-six years of  incessant labour,\" observes a writer at this date, \"have had their  influence even on his powerful frame: he has received one of those  terrible warnings believed to indicate the approach of paralysis.  With General Sleeman will depart the last hope of any improvement in  the condition of the unhappy country of Oude. Though belonging to the  elder class of Indian officials, he has never been Hindooized. He  fully appreciated the evils of a native throne: he has sternly, and  even haughtily, pointed out to the King the miseries caused by his  incapacity, and has frequently extorted from his fears the mercy  which it was vain to hope from his humanity.\"    Later in the year. General Sleeman went to the hills, in the hope of  recruiting his wasted health by change of air and scene; but the  expectation proved vain, and he was compelled to take passage for  England. But it was now too late: notwithstanding the best medical  aid, he gradually sank, and, after a long illness, died on his  passage from Calcutta, on the 10th February, 1856, at the age of  sixty-seven.    His Indian career was, indeed, long and honourable his labours most  meritorious. He was one of those superior men which the Indian  service is constantly producing, who have rendered the name of  Englishman respected throughout the vast empire of British India, and  whose memory will endure so long as British power shall remain in the  East.    It is well known that Lord Dalhousie, on his relinquishing the Indian  Government, recommended General Sleeman and two other distinguished  officers in civil employment for some mark of the royal favour, and  he was accordingly nominated K.C.B., 4th February, 1856; of which  honour his Lordship apprised him in a highly gratifying letter.    But, however high the reputation of an officer placed in such  circumstances--and none stood higher than Sir William Sleeman, not  only in the estimation of the Governor-General and the Honourable  Company, but also in the opinion of the inhabitants of India, where  he had served with great ability for forty years, and won the respect  and love particularly of the natives, who always regarded him as  their friend, and by whom his equity was profoundly appreciated--it  was to be anticipated, as a matter of course, that his words and  actions would be distorted and misrepresented by a Court so  atrociously infamous. This, no doubt, he was prepared to expect, The  King, or rather the creatures who surrounded him, would at all cost  endeavour to prevent any investigation into their gross malpractices,  and seek to slander the man they were unable to remove.    The annexation of Oude to the British dominions followed, but not as  a consequence of Sir W. Sleeman's report. No greater injustice can be  done than to assert that he advised such a course. His letters prove  exactly the reverse. He distinctly states, in his correspondence with  the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, that the annexation of Oude  would cost the British power more than the value of ten such  kingdoms, and would inevitably lead to a mutiny of the Sepoys. He  constantly maintains the advisability of frontier kingdoms under  native sovereigns, that the people themselves might observe the  contrast, to the advantage of the Honourable Company, of the wise and  equitable administration of its rule compared with the oppressive and  cruel despotism of their own princes. Sir William Sleeman had  profoundly studied the Indian character in its different races, and  was deservedly much beloved by them for his earnest desire to promote  their welfare, and for the effectual manner in which, on all  occasions in his power, and these were frequent, he redressed the  evils complained of, and extended the _AEgis_ of British power over  the afflicted and oppressed.                            __________________________      INTRODUCTION.      THE following Narrative of a \"Pilgrimage\" through the kingdom of Oude  was written by the late Major-General Sir William Sleeman in 1851  (while a Resident at the Court of Lucknow), at the request of the  Governor-General the Marquess of Dalhousie, in order to acquaint the  Honourable Company with the actual condition of that kingdom, and  with the view of pointing out the best measures to be suggested to  the King for the improvement and amelioration of the country and  people.    So early as October, 1847, the King of Oude had been informed by the  Governor-General, that if his system of rule were not materially  amended (for it was disgraceful and dangerous to any neighbouring  power to permit its continuance in its present condition) before two  years had expired, the British Government would find it necessary to  take steps for such purpose in his name. Accordingly on the 16th  September, 1848, the Governor-General addressed the following letter  to Sir William Sleeman, commissioning him to make a personal visit to  all parts of the kingdom:--                             \"_Government House, Sept_. 16, 1848.    \"My Dear COLONEL SLEEMAN,--It was a matter of regret to me that I had  not anticipated your desire to succeed Colonel Sutherland in  Rajpootana before I made arrangements which prevented my offering  that appointment to you. I now regret it no longer, since the course  of events has put it in my power to propose an arrangement which  will, I apprehend, be more agreeable to you, and which will make your  services more _actively_ beneficial to the State.    \"Colonel Richmond has intimated his intention of immediately  resigning the Residency at Lucknow. The communication made by the  Governor-General to the King of Oude, in October, 1847, gave His  Majesty to understand that if the condition of Government was not  very materially amended before two years had expired, the management  for his behoof would be taken into the hands of the British  Government.    \"There seems little reason to expect or to hope that in October,  1849, any amendment whatever will have been effected. The  reconstruction of the internal administration of a great, rich, and  oppressed country, is a noble as well as an arduous task for the  officer to whom the duty is intrusted, and the Government have  recourse to one of the best of its servants for that purpose.    \"The high reputation you have earned, your experience of civil  administration, your knowledge of the people, and the qualifications  you possess as a public man, have led me to submit your name to the  Council of India as an officer to whom I could commit this important  charge with entire confidence that its duties would be well  performed. I do myself, therefore, the honour of proposing to you to  accept the office of Resident at Lucknow, with especial reference to  the great changes which, in all probability, will take place.

Blavatsky (#2)"],[1,"gods (tutelary or patron-angels) and useful to the Lanoo. So  shall Wisdom be impressed forever on their hearts and the harmony of the  law shall never be broken.    6. Those who desire to acquire the knowledge leading to the _Siddhis_  (occult powers) have to renounce all the vanities of life and of the  world (here follows enumeration of the Siddhis).    7. None can feel the difference between himself and his  fellow-students, such as \"I am the wisest,\" \"I am more holy and pleasing  to the teacher, or in my community, than my brother,\" etc.,--and remain  an upasaka. His thoughts must be predominantly fixed upon his heart,  chasing therefrom every hostile thought to any living being. It (the  heart) must be full of the feeling of its non-separateness from the rest  of beings as from all in Nature; otherwise no success can follow.    8. A _Lanoo_ (disciple) has to dread external living influence alone  (magnetic emanations from living creatures). For this reason while at  one with all, in his _inner nature_, he must take care to separate his  outer (external) body from every foreign influence: none must drink out  of, or eat in his cup but himself. He must avoid bodily contact (i.e.,  being touched or touch) with human, as with animal being.         [No pet animals are permitted, and it is forbidden even to touch       certain trees and plants. A disciple has to live, so to say, in his       own atmosphere in order to individualize it for occult purposes.]    9. The mind must remain blunt to all but the universal truths in  nature, lest the \"Doctrine of the Heart\" should become only the  \"Doctrine of the Eye,\" (i.e., empty exoteric ritualism).    10. No animal food of whatever kind, nothing that has life in it should  be taken by the disciple. No wine, no spirits, or opium should be used;  for these are like the _Lhama-yin_ (evil spirits), who fasten upon the  unwary, they devour the understanding.         [Wine and spirits are supposed to contain and preserve the bad       magnetism of all the men who helped in their fabrication; the meat       of each animal, to preserve the psychic characteristics of its       kind.]    11. Meditation, abstinence in all, the observation of moral duties,  gentle thoughts, good deeds and kind words, as good will to all and  entire oblivion of Self, are the most efficacious means of obtaining  knowledge and preparing for the reception of higher wisdom.    12. It is only by virtue of a strict observance of the foregoing rules  that a Lanoo can hope to acquire in good time the Siddhis of the  Arhats, the growth which makes him become gradually One with the  Universal ALL.           *       *       *       *       *    These 12 extracts are taken from among some 73 rules, to enumerate which  would be useless as they would be meaningless in Europe. But even these  few are enough to show the immensity of the difficulties which beset the  path of the would-be \"Upasaka,\" who has been born and bred in Western  lands.[B]    All western, and especially English, education is instinct with the  principle of emulation and strife; each boy is urged to learn more  quickly, to outstrip his companions, and to surpass them in every  possible way. What is mis-called \"friendly rivalry\" is assiduously  cultivated, and the same spirit is fostered and strengthened in every  detail of life.    With such ideas \"educated into\" him from his childhood, how can a  Western bring himself to feel towards his co-students \"as the fingers on  one hand\"? Those co-students, too, are not of his _own selection_, or  chosen by himself from personal sympathy and appreciation. They are  chosen by his teacher on far other grounds, and he who would be a  student must _first_ be strong enough to kill out in his heart all  feelings of dislike and antipathy to others. How many Westerns are ready  even to attempt this in earnest?    And then the details of daily life, the command not to touch even the  hand of one's nearest and dearest. How contrary to Western notions of  affection and good feeling! How cold and hard it seems. Egotistical too,  people would say, to abstain from giving pleasure to others for the sake  of one's own development. Well, let those who think so defer till  another lifetime the attempt to enter the path in real earnest. But let  them not glory in their own fancied unselfishness. For, in reality, it  is only the seeming appearances which they allow to deceive them, the  conventional notions, based on emotionalism and gush, or so-called  courtesy, things of the unreal life, not the dictates of Truth.    But even putting aside these difficulties, which may be considered  \"external,\" though their importance is none the less great, how are  students in the West to \"attune themselves\" to harmony as here required  of them? So strong has personality grown in Europe and America, that  there is no school of artists even whose members do not hate and are not  jealous of each other. \"Professional\" hatred and envy have become  proverbial; men seek each to benefit himself at all costs, and even the  so-called courtesies of life are but a hollow mask covering these demons  of hatred and jealousy.    In the East the spirit of \"non-separateness\" is inculcated as steadily  from childhood up, as in the West the spirit of rivalry. Personal  ambition, personal feelings and desires, are not encouraged to grow so  rampant there. When the soil is naturally good, it is cultivated in the  right way, and the child grows into a man in whom the habit of  subordination of one's lower to one's higher Self is strong and  powerful. In the West men think that their own likes and dislikes of  other men and things are guiding principles for them to act upon, even  when they do not make of them the law of their lives and seek to impose  them upon others.    Let those who complain that they have learned little in the Theosophical  Society lay to heart the words written in an article in the _Path_ for  last February:--\"The key in each degree is the _aspirant himself_.\" It  is not \"the fear of God\" which is \"the beginning of Wisdom,\" but the  knowledge of SELF which is WISDOM ITSELF.    How grand and true appears, thus, to the student of Occultism who has  commenced to realize some of the foregoing truths, the answer given by  the Delphic Oracle to all who came seeking after Occult Wisdom--words  repeated and enforced again and again by the wise Socrates:--MAN KNOW  THYSELF.    Chelaship has nothing _whatever_ to do with means of subsistence or  anything of the kind, for a man can isolate his mind entirely from his  body and its surroundings. Chelaship is a _state of mind_, rather than a  life according to hard and fast rules, on the physical plane. This  applies especially to the earlier, probationary period, while the rules  given in _Lucifer_ for April last pertain properly to a later stage,  that of actual occult training and the development of occult powers and  insight. These rules indicate, however, the mode of life which ought to  be followed by all aspirants _so far as practicable_, since it is the  most helpful to them in their aspirations.    It should never be forgotten that Occultism is concerned with the _inner  man_, who must be strengthened and freed from the dominion of the  physical body and its surroundings, which must become his servants.  Hence the _first_ and chief necessity of Chelaship is a spirit of  absolute unselfishness and devotion to Truth; then follow self-knowledge  and self-mastery. These are all-important; while outward observance of  fixed rules of life is a matter of secondary moment.--_Lucifer_: IV,  348, note.          OCCULTISM VERSUS THE OCCULT ARTS        \"I oft have heard, but ne'er believed till now,      There are, who can by potent magic spells      Bend to their crooked purpose Nature's laws.\"                                          _Milton_      In this month's Correspondence several letters testify to the strong  impression produced on some minds by our last month's article \"Practical  Occultism.\" Such letters go far to prove and strengthen two logical  conclusions:--    (_a_) There are more well-educated and thoughtful men who believe in the  existence of Occultism and Magic (the two differing vastly) than the  modern materialist dreams of; and:--    (_b_) That most of the believers (comprising many theosophists) have no  definite idea of the nature of Occultism and confuse it with the Occult  sciences in general, the \"Black art\" included.    Their representations of the powers it confers upon man, and of the  means to be used to acquire them are as varied as they are fanciful.  Some imagine that a master in the art, to show the way, is all that is  needed to become a Zanoni. Others, that one has but to cross the Canal  of Suez and go to India to bloom forth as a Roger Bacon or even a Count  St. Germain. Many take for their ideal Margrave with his ever-renewing  youth, and care little for the soul as the price paid for it. Not a few,  mistaking \"Witch-of-Endorism\" pure and simple, for Occultism--\"through  the yawning Earth from Stygian gloom, call up the meager ghost to walks  of light,\" and want, on the strength of this feat, to be regarded as  full blown Adepts. \"Ceremonial Magic\" according to the rules mockingly  laid down by Eliphas Levi, is another imagined _alter ego_ of the  philosophy of the Arhats of old. In short, the prisms through which  Occultism appears, to those innocent of the philosophy, are as  multicolored and varied as human fancy can make them.    Will these candidates to Wisdom and Power feel very indignant if told  the plain truth? It is not only useful, but it has now become  _necessary_ to disabuse most of them and before it is too late. This  truth may be said in a few words: There are not in the West half-a-dozen  among the fervent hundreds who call themselves \"Occultists,\" who have  even an approximately correct idea of the nature of the Science they  seek"]]]
