In January, he told Doddington that \"Mr. Pitt meditated a  retreat;\" and in the same month Doddington writes to him--\"If the  intelligence they bring me be true, Mr. Pitt goes down fast in the city,  and faster at this end of the town: they add, you rise daily. This may  not be true; but if he sinks, you will observe that his system sinks  with him, and that there is nothing to replace it but recalling the  troops and leaving Hanover in deposit.\" Again, on the 6th of February,  Lord Bute declared, that it was easy to make the Duke of Newcastle  resign, but at the same time he expressed a doubt as to the expediency  of beginning in that quarter. Doddington replied, that he saw no  objection to this step; and that if Bute thought there was, he might put  it into hands that would resign it to him when he thought proper to take  it. But Bute was not disposed to try the duke too much, nor to risk  too bold a leap at once: so all ill humours were concealed under a fair  surface.    Had Earl Bute taken any decisive step thus early in the reign of the new  king, it would probably have exposed him to public derision and scorn.  At this time the old system seemed to please everybody; and among the  supplies voted by the House of Commons, none were more freely granted  than the continental subsidies, and especially that of L670,000 to  the King of Prussia. His victory at Torgau, which subjected all  Saxony--Dresden excepted--to his power, was made known in England just  before the meeting of parliament, and it had the effect of raising him  high in the public favour of the people of England. Nor was it less  advantageous to him on the Continent. His victory, with its results,  indeed, were a full compensation to him for the previous losses he had  sustained during the campaign. Laudohn raised the siege of Cosel, and  evacuated Silesia; the Russians raised that of Colburg, and retreated  into Poland; and the Swedes were driven out of Western Pomerania. In  the same spirit of gratitude, the parliament granted L200,000 to our  colonies in America, for the expenses they had incurred, and the  efforts they had made in the present war--a war which laid some of the  groundworks of the independence which a few years later was claimed by  those colonies.          JUDGES MADE INDEPENDENT OF THE CROWN.    By an act passed in the year 1701, under the reign of William III., the  commissions of the judges were continued _quamdiu bene se gesserint_;  or the power of displacing them was taken from the crown, and their  continuance in office was made solely dependent on the faithful  discharge of their duties, so that it might be lawful to remove them  on the address of both houses to the king. Still, at the demise of the  crown, their offices were vacated, and George II. had even refused to  renew the commission of a judge who had given him personal offence.  Towards the close of this session, his present majesty, in a speech from  the throne, recommended an important improvement in this matter, which  greatly increased his popularity. He declared his wish to render the  bench still more independent of the crown, and the administration of  justice still more impartial; and he recommended that provisions should  be made for the continuance of their commissions and salaries, without  any reference to the death of one king, or the accession of his  successor. In compliance with this expressed wish, a bill was framed for  rendering the judges thus independent, which was carried through both  houses. It received the royal assent on the 19th of March, on which day  his majesty put an end to the session.          CHANGES IN THE CABINET.    Before this event took place, a certain party in the state began to  think that circumstances would authorise them to commence a gradual  change of ministers, and of the policy of the nation. In this his  majesty seems to have coincided, for on the same day that he closed the  session, Mr. Legge, who was co-partner with Mr. Pitt in popularity,  was unceremoniously dismissed from the office of chancellor of the  exchequer, and Sir Francis Dashwood nominated his successor. On the same  day, also, Lord Holderness having secured a pecuniary indemnification,  with the reversion of the wardenship of the cinque ports, resigned the  office of secretary of state in favour of Lord Bute. It was said that  the king \"was tired of having two secretaries, of which one (Pitt)  _would_ do nothing, and the other (Holderness) _could_ do nothing; and  that he would have a secretary who both could and would act.\" At the  same time, Lord Halifax was advanced from the board of trade to be  Lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and was replaced by Lord Barrington; and the  Duke of Richmond, displeased by a military promotion injurious to his  brother, resigned his post as lord of the bed-chamber. Other changes, of  minor importance, took place--such as the introduction of several Tories  into the offices of the court, and there was a considerable addition  made to the peerage. These changes were, doubtless, unpalatable to Mr.  Pitt; but Horace Walpole says that he was somewhat softened by the offer  of the place of cofferer for his brother-in-law, James Grenville. At all  events Mr. Pitt continued in office, and Earl Bute consented to leave  the management of foreign affairs in his hands; but at the same time,  both Bute and his majesty gave him to understand that an end _must_ be  put to the war.          THE OPERATIONS OF THE WAR.    Since the accession of George III., the events of the war had been  various. Although Frederick the Great had driven the Russians and  Austrians from his capital, they were still within his own territory;  while the French were on the side of the Rhine, and the Swedes continued  to threaten invasions. Such was his situation when he heard that George  II, was dead; that his successor was desirous of peace; that some of his  advisers were projecting a separate treaty with France; and that it was  probable that the English subsidies would soon be discontinued. This  intelligence in some degree was confirmed by the tardiness with which  the subsidy, so readily granted by the parliament in December, was paid  into his treasury. Nothing daunted, however, Frederick planned fresh  campaigns, and remonstrated with England; and, as an effect of the bold  front he put upon his affairs, he had the satisfaction of learning,  before he went into winter-quarters, that the Russians had retired  beyond the Vistula, and that the Austrians and Swedes had departed  out of Brandenburg, Silesia, and Pomerania. Still his situation was a  critical one. His losses in men had been great, his coffers were empty,  and his recruiting was therefore difficult: he looked forward to the  campaign of 1761 with doubt and anxiety.    Contrary to the general rules of war, this campaign opened in the very  depth of the winter. Contrasting the strong constitutions of his  troops with the less hardy character of his opponents, Prince Ferdinand  resolved to take them thus by surprise. Accordingly, early in February,  by a sudden attack, he drove the French out of their quarters near  Cassel, and they were only saved from utter destruction, by the defiles,  and other difficulties of the country, which favoured their retreat.  Almost simultaneously with this achievement, the Prussian general,  Sybourg, effected a junction with the Hanoverian general, Sporken,  and took three thousand French prisoners. Subsequently, these generals  defeated the troops of the empire under General Clefeld; and Prince  Ferdinand followed up these advantages by laying siege to Cassel,  Marbourg, and Ziegenhayn. He was ably seconded in his operations by  the Marquis of Granby, but he failed in capturing these places, and  was compelled to retire into the electorate of Hanover. The retreat  of Ferdinand took place in April, and in the same month the hereditary  Prince of Brunswick was defeated by the French under Broglie, near  Frankfort.    At this time, Frederick had certain information that the English were  negociating with the French. This information appears to have paralysed  his efforts, for preparations were not recommenced before June. On their  part the French, also, were inactive till that time, when Broglie, being  joined by the Prince of Soubise with large reinforcements, endeavoured  to drive Prince Ferdinand and the combined army of English and  Hanoverians from their entrenchments at Hohenower. On two several days  Broglie made a fierce attack upon his posts, chiefly directing his  murderous fire against that commanded by Lord Granby; but on the second  day the French gave way, and made a precipitate retreat, leaving behind  them several pieces of cannon, with five thousand of their comrades  sleeping the sleep of death. Their non-success produced mutual  recriminations between Broglie and Soubise, who had never perfectly  agreed, and they resolved to separate: Broglie crossed the Weser, and  threatened to fall upon Hanover, while Soubise crossed the Lippe, as if  with the intention of laying siege to Munster.    The division of the French army caused a corresponding division in that  of Prince Ferdinand; for whilst he marched with one half to watch the  operations of Broglie, the hereditary Prince of Brunswick marched with  the other half to check the career of Soubise. The skill and vigour of  Ferdinand prevented Broglie from making any important conquests, though  he could not protect the country from his ravages. Perceiving, indeed,  that he could not check the onward march of his enemy, Ferdinand turned  aside into Hesse, and cut off all the communications of the French  in that country, destroying their magazines and menacing their forts,  which, as he foresaw, had the effect of alarming Broglie, and causing  him to retreat out of Hanover.

A LAUGH IN CHURCH        She sat on the sliding cushion,    The dear, wee woman of four;    Her feet, in their shiny slippers,    Hung dangling over the floor.    She meant to be good; she had promised,    And so with her big, brown eyes,    She stared at the meetinghouse windows    And counted the crawling flies.      She looked far up at the preacher,    But she thought of the honeybees    Droning away at the blossoms    That whitened the cherry trees.    She thought of a broken basket,    Where curled in a dusky heap,    Four sleek, round puppies, with fringy ears.    Lay snuggled and fast asleep.      Such soft, warm bodies to cuddle,    Such queer little hearts to beat,    Such swift round tongues to kiss,    Such sprawling, cushiony feet;    She could feel in her clasping fingers    The touch of the satiny skin,    And a cold, wet nose exploring    The dimples under her chin.      Then a sudden ripple of laughter    Ran over the parted lips    So quick that she could not catch it    With her rosy finger-tips.    The people whispered \"Bless the child,\"    As each one waked from a nap,    But the dear, wee woman hid her face    For shame in her mother's lap.        ANONYMOUS.

LITTLE LOST PUP        He was lost!--Not a shade of doubt of that;    For he never barked at a slinking cat,    But stood in the square where the wind blew raw,    With a drooping ear, and a trembling paw,    And a mournful look in his pleading eye,    And a plaintive sniff at the passer-by    That begged as plain as a tongue could sue,    \"Oh, Mister, please may I follow you?\"    A lorn, wee waif of a tawny brown    Adrift in the roar of a heedless town.

Well, he won my heart (for I set great store    On my own red Bute, who is here no more)    So I whistled clear, and he trotted up,    And who so glad as that small lost pup?      Now he shares my board, and he owns my bed,    And he fairly shouts when he hears my tread.    Then if things go wrong, as they sometimes do,    And the world is cold, and I'm feeling blue,    He asserts his right to assuage my woes    With a warm, red tongue and a nice, cold nose,    And a silky head on my arm or knee,    And a paw as soft as a paw can be.      When we rove the woods for a league about    He's as full of pranks as a school let out;    For he romps and frisks like a three-months colt,    And he runs me down like a thunder-bolt.
