One of  them: after having suffered intense vicissitudes, He was made homeless and  a wanderer and fell a victim to still new vexations and troubles. In  'Iraq, the Day-Star of the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people  of malice as to be eclipsed in splendor. Later on He was sent an exile to  the Great City (Constantinople) and thence to the Land of Mystery  (Adrianople), whence, grievously wronged, He was eventually transferred to  the Most Great Prison (Akka). He Whom the world hath wronged (may my life  be offered for His loved ones) was four times banished from city to city,  till at last condemned to perpetual confinement, He was incarcerated in  this Prison, the prison of highway robbers, of brigands and of manslayers.  All this is but one of the trials that have afflicted the Blessed Beauty,  the rest being even as grievous as this.          \"According to the direct and sacred command of God we are...\"      According to the direct and sacred command of God we are forbidden to  utter slander, are commanded to show forth peace and amity, are exhorted  to rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and harmony with all the  kindreds and peoples of the world. We must obey and be the well-wishers of  the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as  disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a  transgression of the Cause of God.          \"O God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine,...\"      O God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine, held fast in the  talons of ferocious lions, of ravening wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts.  Graciously assist me, through my love for Thee, that I may drink deep of  the chalice that brimmeth over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled  with Thy bountiful Grace; so that, fallen upon the dust, I may sink  prostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with my blood.  This is my wish, my heart's desire, my hope, my pride, my glory. Grant, O  Lord my God, and my Refuge, that in my last hour, my end, may even as musk  shed its fragrance of glory! Is there a bounty greater than this? Nay, by  Thy Glory! I call Thee to witness that no day passeth but that I quaff my  fill from this cup, so grievous are the misdeeds wrought by them that have  broken the Covenant, kindled discord, showed their malice, stirred  sedition in the land and dishonored Thee amidst Thy servants. Lord! Shield  Thou from these Covenant-breakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy Faith and  protect Thy secret Sanctuary from the onslaught of the ungodly. Thou art  in truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, the Strong.          \"O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of...\"      O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and  passion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving kindness from  all rancour, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of  Thy Cause and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the  manifestations of Thy glorious Signs, illumine their faces with the  effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity, gladden their  hearts with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom, strengthen their  loins by Thy all-swaying power that cometh from Thy Realm of Glory. Thou  art the All-bountiful, the Protector, the Almighty, the Gracious!    O ye that stand fast in the Covenant! When the hour cometh that this  wronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto the  celestial concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the Unseen  and its mortal frame will have been either lost or hidden neath the dust,  it is incumbent upon the Afnan, that are steadfast in the Covenant of God,  and have branched from the Tree of Holiness; the Hands, (pillars) of the  Cause of God, (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the friends  and loved ones, one and all to bestir themselves and arise with heart and  soul and in one accord, to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to teach His  Cause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest for a  moment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in every  land, pass by every clime and travel throughout all regions. Bestirred,  without rest and steadfast to the end they must raise in every land the  triumphal cry \"O Thou the Glory of Glories!\" (Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha), must  achieve renown in the world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a  candle in every meeting and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every  assembly; that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost  heart of the world, that throughout the East and throughout the West a  vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the  sweet savors of holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly,  hearts be filled with the Divine spirit and souls be made heavenly.    In these days, the most important of all things is the guidance of the  nations and peoples of the world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost  importance for it is the head corner-stone of the foundation itself. This  wronged servant has spent his days and night in promoting the Cause and  urging the peoples to service. He rested not a moment, till the fame of  the Cause of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains  from the Abha Kingdom roused the East and the West. The beloved of God  must also follow the same example. This is the secret of faithfulness,  this is the requirement of servitude to the Threshold of Baha!    The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly things, forsook  all their cares and belongings, purged themselves of self and passion and  with absolute detachment scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the  peoples of the world to the Divine Guidance, till at last they made the  world another world, illumined the surface of the earth and even to their  last hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that Beloved One of  God. Finally in various lands they suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them  that are men of action follow in their footsteps!    O my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged one, it is  incumbent upon the A_gh_san (Branches), the Afnan (Twigs) of the Sacred  Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God and the loved ones of  the Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi--the youthful branch branched  from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit grown from the  union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,--as he is the sign of  God, the chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all  the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones  must turn. He is the expounder of the words of God and after him will  succeed the first-born of his lineal descendants.    The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, as well  as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and  established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha Beauty,  under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One  (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of  God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God;  whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God;  whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath  contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso  denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in  God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath  in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the  wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! The  mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to  him who is the guardian of the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon the  members of the House of Justice, upon all the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the  Hands of the Cause of God to show their obedience, submissiveness and  subordination unto the guardian of the Cause of God, to turn unto him and  be lowly before him. He that opposeth him hath opposed the True One, will  make a breach in the Cause of God, will subvert His word and will become a  manifestation of the Center of Sedition. Beware, beware, lest the days  after the ascension (of Baha'u'llah) be repeated when the Center of  Sedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse  deprived himself and perturbed and poisoned others. No doubt every  vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly  declare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold, would he seize  upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the  gathering of the people of Baha. My object is to show that the Hands of  the Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone  beginning to oppose and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God  cast him out from the congregation of the people of Baha and in no wise  accept any excuse from him. How often hath grievous error been disguised  in the garb of truth, that it might sow the seeds of doubt in the hearts  of men!    O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon the guardian of the Cause  of God to appoint in his own life-time him that shall become his  successor, that differences may not arise after his passing. He that is  appointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things,  must be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear of God,  knowledge, wisdom and learning. Thus, should the first-born of the  guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the  words:--\"The child is the secret essence of its sire,\" that is, should he  not inherit of the spiritual within him (the guardian of the Cause of God)  and his glorious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#2)"],[1,"of American Baha'i history in  continents of Western Hemisphere.    [March 24, 1947]            PARTICIPATION IN SECOND SEVEN YEAR PLAN  [MESSAGE TO 1947 CONVENTION]      My heart is filled with delight, wonder, pride and gratitude in  contemplation of the peace-time exploits, in both hemispheres, of the  world community of the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, triumphantly  emerging from the crucible of global war and moving irresistibly into the  second epoch of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Dispensation.    The opening years of the second century of the Baha'i Era, synchronizing  with concluding stage of the memorable quarter-century elapsed since the  termination of the Heroic Age of the Faith, have been distinguished by a  compelling demonstration by the entire body of believers, headed by the  valorous American Baha'i Community, of solidarity, resolve and  self-sacrifice as well as by a magnificent record of systematic,  world-wide achievements.    The three years since the celebration of the Centenary have been  characterized by a simultaneous process of internal consolidation and  steady enlargement of the orbit of a fast-evolving Administrative Order.    These years witnessed, first, the astounding resurgence of a  war-devastated Baha'i community of Central Europe, the rehabilitation of  the communities in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and the Far East;  second, the inauguration of a new Seven Year Plan by the American Baha'i  Community destined to culminate with the Centenary of the Birth of  Baha'u'llah's Prophetic Mission, aiming at the formation of three national  assemblies in Latin America and the Dominion of Canada, at completion of  the holiest House of Worship in the Baha'i world, and at the erection of  the structure of the Administrative Order in ten sovereign states of the  European continent; and third, the formulation by the British, the Indian  and the Persian National Assemblies of Six Year, Four and One-Half Year,  and Forty-Five Month Plans respectively, culminating with the Centenary of  the Bab's Martyrdom and pledged to establish nineteen spiritual assemblies  in the British Isles, double the number of assemblies in the Indian  subcontinent, establish ninety-five new centers of the Faith in Persia,  convert the groups in Bahrein, Mecca and Kabul into assemblies and plant  the banner of the Faith in the Arabian territories of Yemen, Oman, Ahsa  and Kuweit.    Moreover, the number of countries opened to the onsweeping Faith, and the  number of languages in which its literature has been translated and  printed, is now raised to eighty-three and forty-seven, respectively. Four  additional countries are in process of enrollment. Translations into  fifteen other languages are being undertaken. No less than seventeen  thousand pounds have accumulated for the international relief of  war-afflicted Baha'i communities of East and West. The Baha'i endowments  on the North American continent have now passed the two million dollar  mark. The value of the endowments recently acquired at the World Center of  the Faith, dedicated to the Shrines, are estimated at thirty-five thousand  pounds. Baha'i literature has been disseminated as far north as Upernavik,  Greenland, above the Arctic Circle. The Baha'i message has been broadcast  by radio as far south as Magallanes. The area of land dedicated to the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of Persia has increased by almost a quarter-million  square meters. The number of localities in the Antipodes where Baha'is  reside has been raised to thirty-five, spread over Australia, New Zealand  and Tasmania. Twenty-seven assemblies are functioning in Latin America. In  over a hundred localities Baha'is are resident in Central and South  America, almost double the localities at opening of the first Seven Year  Plan. Historic Latin American conferences have been held in Buenos Aires  and Panama. Summer schools are established in Argentina and Chile. Land  has been offered in Chile for site of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of  Latin America. Additional assemblies have been incorporated in Paraguay  and Colombia. Seven others are in process of incorporation. A notable  impetus has been lent this world-redeeming Message through the concerted  measures devised by the American National Assembly designed to proclaim  the Faith to the masses through public conferences, press and radio.    Such remarkable multiplication of dynamic institutions, such thrilling  deployment of world-regenerating forces, North, South, East and West,  endow the preeminent goal of the Second Seven Year Plan in Europe with  extraordinary urgency and peculiar significance. I am impelled to appeal  to all American believers possessing independent means to arise and  supplement the course of the second year of the Second Seven Year Plan  through personal participation or appointment of deputies, the superb  exertions of the heroic vanguard of the hosts destined, through successive  decades, to achieve the spiritual conquest of the continent unconquered by  Islam, rightly regarded as the mother of Christendom, the fountainhead of  American culture, the mainspring of western civilization, and the  recipient of the unique honor of two successive visits to its shores by  the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant.    [April 28, 1947]            NSA MUST CONTROL CREDENTIALS OF FOREIGNERS      Owing to arrival of disloyal so-called Baha'is your Assembly's control of  credentials should be strictly exercised, otherwise corruptive influences  will spread and injure the magnificent services being achieved by the  American Baha'i Community.    [Circa June 1947]            THE CHALLENGING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRESENT HOUR      The opening years of the second century of the Baha'i Era have  synchronized with the termination of the first epoch of the Formative Age  of the Baha'i Dispensation, a Dispensation which posterity will recognize  as the most glorious and momentous in the greatest cycle in the world's  religious history.    The first seventy-seven years of the preceding century, constituting the  Apostolic and Heroic Age of our Faith, fell into three distinct epochs, of  nine, of thirty-nine and of twenty-nine years' duration, associated  respectively with the Babi Dispensation and the ministries of Baha'u'llah  and of 'Abdu'l-Baha. This Primitive Age of the Baha'i Era, unapproached in  spiritual fecundity by any period associated with the mission of the  Founder of any previous Dispensation, was impregnated, from its inception  to its termination, with the creative energies generated through the  advent of two independent Manifestations and the establishment of a  Covenant unique in the spiritual annals of mankind.    The last twenty-three years of that same century coincided with the first  epoch of the second, the Iron and Formative, Age of the Dispensation of  Baha'u'llah--the first of a series of epochs which must precede the  inception of the last and Golden Age of that Dispensation--a Dispensation  which, as the Author of the Faith has Himself categorically asserted, must  extend over a period of no less than one thousand years, and which will  constitute the first stage in a series of Dispensations, to be established  by future Manifestations, all deriving their inspiration from the Author  of the Baha'i Revelation, and destined to last, in their aggregate, no  less than five thousand centuries.    We are now entering the second epoch of the second Age of the first of  these Dispensations. The first epoch witnessed the birth and the primary  stages in the erection of the framework of the Administrative Order of the  Faith--the nucleus and pattern of its World Order--according to the precepts  laid down in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament, as well as the launching  of the initial phase of the world-encompassing Plan bequeathed by Him to  the American Baha'i Community. That epoch was characterized by a twofold  process aiming at the consolidation of the administrative structure of the  Faith and the extension of the range of its institutions. It witnessed on  the one hand, the emergence and the laying of the groundwork of that  embryonic World Order whose advent was announced by the Bab in the Bayan,  whose laws were revealed by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and whose  features were delineated by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will and Testament. It was  marked on the other hand by the launching, in the Western Hemisphere, of  the first stage of a Plan whose original impulse was communicated by the  Herald of our Faith in His Qayyumu'l-Asma, to whose implications the  Author of the Baha'i Revelation alluded in His Tablets, and whose Charter  was revealed by the Center of His Covenant in the evening of His life.    The epoch we have now entered is destined to impart a great impetus to  this historic, this twofold process. It must witness, on the one hand, the  consummation of a laboriously constructed Administrative Order, and, on  the other, the unfoldment of successive stages in the development of  'Abdu'l-Baha's Plan beyond the confines of the Western Hemisphere and of  the continent of Europe.            CROWNING FEATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER: THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE      During this Formative Age of the Faith, and in the course of present and  succeeding epochs, the last and crowning stage in the erection of the  framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah--the  election of the Universal House of Justice--will have been completed, the  Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of His Revelation, will have been codified  and its laws promulgated, the Lesser Peace will have been established, the  unity of mankind will have been achieved and its maturity attained, the  Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha will have been executed, the emancipation  of the Faith from the fetters of religious orthodoxy will have been  effected, and its independent religious status will have been"]]]
