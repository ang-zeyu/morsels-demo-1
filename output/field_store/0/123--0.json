A SHORT HISTORY    OF    THE UNITED STATES    _FOR SCHOOL USE_    BY    EDWARD CHANNING    PROFESSOR OF HISTORY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY  AUTHOR OF \"A STUDENTS' HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES,\" ETC.          _WITH MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS_      1908          PREFACE      The aim of this little book is to tell in a simple and concise form the  story of the founding and development of the United States. The study of  the history of one's own country is a serious matter, and should be  entered upon by the text-book writer, by the teacher, and by the pupil  in a serious spirit, even to a greater extent than the study of language  or of arithmetic. No effort has been made, therefore, to make out of  this text-book a story book. It is a text-book pure and simple, and  should be used as a text-book, to be studied diligently by the pupil and  expounded carefully by the teacher.    Most of the pupils who use this book will never have another opportunity  to study the history and institutions of their own country. It is highly  desirable that they should use their time in studying the real history  of the United States and not in learning by heart a mass of  anecdotes,--often of very slight importance, and more often based on  very insecure foundations. The author of this text-book, therefore, has  boldly ventured to omit most of the traditional matter which is usually  supposed to give life to a text-book and to inspire a \"love of  history,\"--which too often means only a love of being amused. For  instance, descriptions of the formation of the Constitution and of the  struggle over the extension of slavery here occupy the space usually  given to the adventures of Captain John Smith and to accounts of the  institutions of the Red Men. The small number of pages available for the  period before 1760 has necessitated the omission of \"pictures of  colonial life,\" which cannot be briefly and at the same time accurately  described. These and similar matters can easily be studied by the pupils  in their topical work in such books as Higginson's _Young Folks'  History_, Eggleston's _United States and its People_, and McMaster's  _School History_. References to these books and to a limited number of  other works have been given in the margins of this text-book. These  citations also mention a few of the more accessible sources, which  should be used solely for purposes of illustration.    It is the custom in many schools to spread the study of American history  over two years, and to devote the first year to a detailed study of the  period before 1760. This is a very bad arrangement. In the first place,  it gives an undue emphasis to the colonial period; in the second place,  as many pupils never return to school, they never have an opportunity to  study the later period at all; in the third place, it prevents those  pupils who complete this study from gaining an intelligent view of the  development of the American people. And, finally, most of the time the  second year is spent in the study of the Revolutionary War and of the  War for the Union. A better way would be to go over the whole book the  first year with some parallel reading, and the second year to review the  book and study with greater care important episodes, as the making of  the Constitution, the struggle for freedom in the territories, and the  War for the Union. Attention may also be given the second year to a  study of industrial history since 1790 and to the elements of civil  government. It is the author's earnest hope that teachers will regard  the early chapters as introductory.    Miss Annie Bliss Chapman, for many years a successful teacher of history  in grammar schools, has kindly provided a limited number of suggestive  questions, and has also made many excellent suggestions to teachers.  These are all appended to the several divisions of the work. The author  has added a few questions and a few suggestions of his own. He has also  altered some of Miss Chapman's questions. Whatever there is commendable  in this apparatus should be credited to Miss Chapman. Acknowledgments  are also due to Miss Beulah Marie Dix for very many admirable  suggestions as to language and form. The author will cordially welcome  criticisms and suggestions from any one, especially from teachers, and  will be very glad to receive notice of any errors.    CAMBRIDGE,    March 29, 1900.

TO THE TEACHER      The lists of \"Books for Study and Reading\" contain such titles only as  are suited to the pupil's needs. The teacher will find abundant  references in Channing's _Students' History of the United States_ (N.Y.,  Macmillan). The larger work also contains the reasons for many  statements which are here given as facts without qualification.  Reference to the _Students' History_ is made easy by the fact that the  divisions or parts (here marked by Roman numerals) cover the same  periods in time as the chapters of the larger work. On the margins of  the present volume will be found specific references to three text-books  radically unlike this text-book either in proportion or in point of  view. There are also references to easily accessible sources and to a  few of the larger works. It is not suggested that any one pupil, or even  one class, shall study or read all of these references. But every pupil  may well read some of them under each division. They are also suited to  topical work. Under the head of \"Home Readings\" great care has been  taken to mention such books only as are likely to be found interesting.    The books most frequently cited in the margins are Higginson's _Young  Folks' History_ (N.Y., Longmans), cited as \"_Higginson_\"; Eggleston's  _United States and its People_ (N.Y., Appleton), cited as \"_Eggleston_\",  McMaster's _School History of the United States_ (N.Y., American Book  Co.), cited as \"_McMaster_\"; Higginson's _Book of American Explorers_  (N.Y., Longmans), cited as \"_Explorers_\"; Lodge and Roosevelt, _Hero  Tales from American History_, cited as \"_Hero Tales_\"; and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],[0,"Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#1)"],[1,"Team, from scans provided by Case Western Reserve  University's Preservation Department            ROUTLEDGE'S  MANUAL OF ETIQUETTE      ETIQUETTE FOR LADIES    ETIQUETTE FOR GENTLEMEN    BALL-ROOM COMPANION    COURTSHIP & MATRIMONY    HOW TO DRESS WELL    HOW TO CARVE    TOASTS AND SENTIMENTS    GEORGE ROUTLEDGE AND SONS          CONTENTS.

To introduce persons who are mutually unknown is to undertake a  serious responsibility, and to certify to each the respectability of  the other. Never undertake this responsibility without in the first  place asking yourself whether the persons are likely to be agreeable  to each other; nor, in the second place, without ascertaining whether  it will be acceptable to both parties to become acquainted.    Always introduce the gentleman to the lady--never the lady to  the gentleman. The chivalry of etiquette assumes that the lady is  invariably the superior in right of her sex, and that the gentleman  is honoured in the introduction. This rule is to be observed even when  the social rank of the gentleman is higher than that of the lady.    Where the sexes are the same, always present the inferior to the  superior.    Never present a gentleman to a lady without first asking her  permission to do so.    When you are introduced to a gentleman, never offer your hand. When  introduced, persons limit their recognition of each other to a bow.  On the Continent, ladies never shake hands with gentlemen unless under  circumstances of great intimacy.    Never introduce morning visitors who happen to encounter each other  in your drawing-room, unless they are persons whom you have already  obtained permission to make known to each other. Visitors thus  casually meeting in the house of a friend should converse with ease  and freedom, as if they were acquainted. That they are both friends of  the hostess is a sufficient guarantee of their respectability. To be  silent and stiff on such an occasion would show much-ignorance and  ill-breeding.    Persons who have met at the house of a mutual friend, without being  introduced, should not bow if they afterwards meet elsewhere. A bow  implies acquaintance; and persons who have not been introduced are not  acquainted.    If you are walking with one friend, and presently meet with, or  are joined by, a third, do not commit the too frequent error of  introducing them to each other. You have even less right to do so than  if they encountered each other at your house during a morning call.    There are some exceptions to the etiquette of introductions. At a  ball, or evening party where there is dancing, the mistress of the  house may introduce any gentleman to any lady without first asking the  lady's permission. But she should first ascertain whether the lady is  willing to dance; and this out of consideration for the gentleman,  who may otherwise be refused. No man likes to be refused the hand of a  lady, though it be only for a quadrille.    A sister may present her brother, or a mother her son, without any  kind of preliminary; but only when there is no inferiority on the part  of her own family to that of the acquaintance.    Friends may introduce friends at the house of a mutual acquaintance;  but, as a rule, it is better to be introduced by the mistress of the  house. Such an introduction carries more authority with it.    Introductions at evening parties are now almost wholly dispensed with.  Persons who meet at a friend's house are ostensibly upon an equality,  and pay a bad compliment to the host by appearing suspicious and  formal. Some old-fashioned country hosts yet persevere in introducing  each new comer to all the assembled guests. It is a custom that  cannot be too soon abolished, and one that places the last unfortunate  visitor in a singularly awkward position. All that she can do is  to make a semicircular courtesy, like a concert singer before  an audience, and bear the general gaze with as much composure as  possible.    If, when you enter a drawing-room, your name has been wrongly  announced, or has passed unheard in the buzz of conversation, make  your way at once to the mistress of the house, if you are a stranger,  and introduce yourself by name. This should be done with the greatest  simplicity, and your rank made as little of as possible.    An introduction given at a ball for the mere purpose of conducting a  lady through a dance does not give the gentleman any right to bow to  her on a future occasion. If he commits this error, she may remember  that she is not bound to see, or return, his salutation.           *       *       *       *       *    II.--LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.      Do not lightly give or promise letters of introduction. Always  remember that when you give a letter of introduction you lay yourself  under an obligation to the friend to whom it is addressed. If she  lives in a great city, such as Paris or London, you in a measure  compel her to undergo the penalty of escorting the stranger to some of  those places of public entertainment in which the capital abounds. If  your friend be a married lady, and the mistress of a house, you put  her to the expense of inviting the stranger to her table. We cannot be  too cautious how we tax the time and purse of a friend, or weigh too  seriously the question of mutual advantage in the introduction. Always  ask yourself whether the person introduced will be an acceptable  acquaintance to the one to whom you present her; and whether the  pleasure of knowing her"]]]
