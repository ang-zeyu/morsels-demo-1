The Legends of KING ARTHUR and his KNIGHTS    Sir James Knowles    Illustrated by Lancelot Speed      TO  ALFRED TENNYSON, D.C.L.  POET LAUREATE    THIS ATTEMPT AT A POPULAR VERSION OF  THE ARTHUR LEGENDS  IS BY HIS PERMISSION DEDICATED  AS A TRIBUTE  OF THE SINCEREST AND WARMEST RESPECT      1862          PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION      The Publishers have asked me to authorise a new edition, in my own name,  of this little book--now long out of print--which was written by me  thirty-five years ago under the initials J.T.K.    In acceding to their request I wish to say that the book as now published  is merely a word-for-word reprint of my early effort to help to popularise  the Arthur legends.    It is little else than an abridgment of Sir Thomas Malory's version of  them as printed by Caxton--with a few additions from Geoffrey of Monmouth  and other sources--and an endeavour to arrange the many tales into a more  or less consecutive story.    The chief pleasure which came to me from it was, and is, that it began for  me a long and intimate acquaintance with Lord Tennyson, to whom, by his  permission, I Dedicated it before I was personally known to him.    JAMES KNOWLES.          _Addendum by Lady Knowles_      In response to a widely expressed wish for a fresh edition of this little  book--now for some years out of print--a new and ninth edition has been  prepared.    In his preface my husband says that the intimacy with Lord Tennyson to  which it led was the chief pleasure the book brought him. I have been  asked to furnish a few more particulars on this point that may be  generally interesting, and feel that I cannot do better than give some  extracts from a letter written by himself to a friend in July 1896.    \"DEAR ----,    \"I am so _very_ glad you approve of my little effort to popularise the  Arthur Legends. Tennyson had written his first four 'Idylls of the King'  before my book appeared, which was in 1861. Indeed, it was in consequence  of the first four Idylls that I sought and obtained, while yet a stranger  to him, leave to dedicate my venture to him. He was extremely kind about  it--declared 'it ought to go through forty editions'--and when I came to  know him personally talked very frequently about it and Arthur with me,  and made constant use of it when he at length yielded to my perpetual  urgency and took up again his forsaken project of treating the whole  subject of King Arthur.    \"He discussed and rediscussed at any amount of length the way in which  this could now be done--and the Symbolism, which had from his earliest  time haunted him as the inner meaning to be given to it, brought him back  to the Poem in its changed shape of separate pictures.    \"He used often to say that it was entirely my doing that he revived his  old plan, and added, 'I know more about Arthur than any other man in  England, and I think you know next most.' It would amuse you to see in  what intimate detail he used to consult with me--and often with my little  book in front of us--over the various tales, and when I wrote an article  (in the shape of a long letter) in the _Spectator_ of January 1870 he  asked to reprint it, and published it with the collected Idylls.    \"For years, while his boys were at school and college, I acted as his  confidential friend in business and many other matters, and I suppose he  told me more about himself and his life than any other man now living  knows.\"    ISABEL KNOWLES.

Of scenes from the Legends of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round  Table many lovely pictures have been painted, showing much diversity of  figures and surroundings, some being definitely sixth-century British or  Saxon, as in Blair Leighton's fine painting of the dead Elaine;  others--for example, Watts' Sir Galahad--show knight and charger in  fifteenth-century armour; while the warriors of Burne Jones wear strangely  impracticable armour of some mystic period. Each of these painters was  free to follow his own conception, putting the figures into whatever  period most appealed to his imagination; for he was not illustrating the  actual tales written by Sir Thomas Malory, otherwise he would have found  himself face to face with a difficulty.    King Arthur and his knights fought, endured, and toiled in the sixth  century, when the Saxons were overrunning Britain; but their achievements  were not chronicled by Sir Thomas Malory until late in the fifteenth  century.    Sir Thomas, as Froissart has done before him, described the habits of  life, the dresses, weapons, and armour that his own eyes looked upon in  the every-day scenes about him, regardless of the fact that almost every  detail mentioned was something like a thousand years too late.    Had Malory undertaken an account of the landing of Julius Caesar he would,  as a matter of course, have protected the Roman legions with bascinet or  salade, breastplate, pauldron and palette, coudiere, taces and the rest,  and have armed them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#1)"],[1,"OF THE WORLD'S BEST MYSTERY AND DETECTIVE STORIES    EDITED BY JULIAN HAWTHORNE      One Hundred and One Tales of Mystery  By Famous Authors of East and West    In Six Volumes      New York  The Review of Reviews Company    1907      AMERICAN :: FRENCH, ITALIAN, ETC.

Letter to Sura        _French--Italian--Spanish--Latin Mystery Stories_          HENRI RENE ALBERT GUY DE MAUPASSANT    _The Necklace_      She was one of those pretty and charming girls who are sometimes, as if  by a mistake of destiny, born in a family of clerks. She had no dowry,  no expectations, no means of being known, understood, loved, wedded, by  any rich and distinguished man; and she let herself be married to a  little clerk at the Ministry of Public Instruction.    She dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was as  unhappy as though she had really fallen from her proper station; since  with women there is neither caste nor rank; and beauty, grace, and  charm act instead of family and birth. Natural fineness, instinct for  what is elegant, suppleness of wit, are the sole hierarchy, and make  from women of the people the equals of the very greatest ladies.    She suffered ceaselessly, feeling herself born for all the delicacies  and all the luxuries. She suffered from the poverty of her dwelling,  from the wretched look of the walls, from the worn-out chairs, from the  ugliness of the curtains. All those things, of which another woman of  her rank would never even have been conscious, tortured her and made  her angry. The sight of the little Breton peasant who did her humble  housework aroused in her regrets which were despairing, and distracted  dreams. She thought of the silent antechambers hung with Oriental  tapestry, lit by tall bronze candelabra, and of the two great footmen  in knee breeches who sleep in the big armchairs, made drowsy by the  heavy warmth of the hot-air stove. She thought of the long  _salons_ fatted up with ancient silk, of the delicate furniture  carrying priceless curiosities, and of the coquettish perfumed boudoirs  made for talks at five o'clock with intimate friends, with men famous  and sought after, whom all women envy and whose attention they all  desire.    When she sat down to dinner, before the round table covered with a  tablecloth three days old, opposite her husband, who uncovered the soup  tureen and declared with an enchanted air, \"Ah, the good  _pot-au-feu_! I don't know anything better than that,\" she thought  of dainty dinners, of shining silverware, of tapestry which peopled the  walls with ancient personages and with strange birds flying in the  midst of a fairy forest; and she thought of delicious dishes served on  marvelous plates, and of the whispered gallantries which you listen to  with a sphinx-like smile, while you are eating the pink flesh of a  trout or the wings of a quail.    She had no dresses, no jewels, nothing. And she loved nothing but that;  she felt made for that. She would so have liked to please, to be  envied, to be charming, to be sought after.    She had a friend, a former schoolmate at the convent, who was rich, and  whom she did not like to go and see any more, because she suffered so  much when she came back.    But, one evening, her husband returned home with a triumphant air, and  holding a large envelope in his hand.    \"There,\" said he, \"here is something for you.\"    She tore the paper sharply, and drew out a printed card which bore  these words:    \"The Minister of Public Instruction and Mme. Georges Ramponneau request  the honor of M. and Mme. Loisel's company at the palace of the Ministry  on Monday evening, January 18th.\"    Instead of being delighted, as her husband hoped, she threw the  invitation on the table with disdain, murmuring:    \"What do you want me to do with that?\"    \"But, my dear, I thought you would be glad. You never go out, and this  is such a fine opportunity. I had awful trouble to get it. Everyone  wants to go; it is very select, and they are not giving many  invitations to clerks. The whole official world will be there.\"    She looked at him with an irritated eye, and she said, impatiently:    \"And what do you want me to put on my back?\"    He had not thought of that; he stammered:    \"Why, the dress you go to the theater in. It looks very well, to me.\"    He stopped, distracted, seeing that his wife was crying. Two great  tears descended slowly from the corners of her eyes toward the corners  of her mouth. He stuttered:    \"What's the matter? What's the matter?\"    But, by a violent effort, she had conquered her grief, and she replied,  with a calm voice, while she wiped her wet cheeks:    \"Nothing. Only I have no dress, and therefore I can't go to this ball.  Give your card to some colleague whose wife is better equipped than I.\"    He was in despair. He resumed:    \"Come, let us see, Mathilde. How much would it cost, a suitable dress,  which you could use on other occasions, something very simple?\"    She reflected several seconds, making her calculations and wondering  also what sum she could ask without drawing on herself an immediate  refusal and a frightened exclamation from the economical clerk.    Finally, she replied, hesitatingly:    \"I don't know exactly, but I think I could manage it with four hundred  francs.\"    He had grown a little pale, because he was laying aside just that  amount to buy a gun and treat himself to a little shooting next summer  on the plain of Nanterre, with several friends who went to shoot larks  down there of a Sunday.    But he said:    \"All right. I will give you four hundred francs. And try to have a  pretty dress.\"    The day of the ball drew near, and Mme. Loisel seemed sad, uneasy,  anxious. Her dress was ready, however. Her husband said to her one  evening:    \"What is the matter? Come, you've been so queer these last three days.\"    And she answered:    \"It annoys me not to have a single jewel, not a single stone, nothing  to put on. I shall look like distress. I should almost rather not go at  all.\"    He resumed:    \"You might wear natural flowers. It's very stylish at this time of the  year. For ten francs you can get two or three magnificent roses.\"    She was not convinced.    \"No; there's nothing more humiliating than to look poor among other  women who are rich.\"    But her husband cried:    \"How stupid you are! Go look up your friend Mme. Forestier, and ask her  to lend you some jewels. You're quite thick enough with her to do  that.\"    She uttered a cry of joy:    \"It's true. I never thought of it.\"    The next day she went to her friend and told of her distress.    Mme. Forestier went to a wardrobe with a glass door, took out a large  jewel box, brought it back, opened it, and said to Mme. Loisel:    \"Choose, my dear.\"    She saw first of all some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a  Venetian cross, gold and precious stones of admirable workmanship. She  tried on the ornaments before the glass, hesitated, could not make up  her mind to part with them, to give them back. She kept asking:    \"Haven't you any more?\"    \"Why, yes. Look. I don't know what you like.\"    All of a sudden she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb necklace  of diamonds, and her heart began to beat with an immoderate desire. Her  hands trembled as she took it. She fastened it around her throat,  outside her high-necked dress, and remained lost in ecstasy at the  sight of herself.    Then she asked, hesitating, filled with anguish:    \"Can you lend me that, only that?\"    \"Why, yes, certainly.\"    She sprang upon the neck of her friend, kissed her passionately, then  fled with her treasure.           *       *       *       *       *    The day of the ball arrived. Mme. Loisel made a great success. She was  prettier than them all, elegant, gracious, smiling, and crazy with joy.  All the men looked at her, asked her name, endeavored to be introduced.  All the attaches of the Cabinet wanted to waltz with her. She was  remarked by the minister himself.    She danced with intoxication, with passion, made drunk by pleasure,  forgetting all, in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her  success, in a sort of cloud of happiness composed of all this homage,  of all this admiration, of all these awakened desires, and of that  sense of complete victory which is so sweet to woman's heart.    She went away about four o'clock in the morning. Her husband had been  sleeping since midnight, in a little deserted anteroom, with three  other gentlemen whose wives were having a very good time.    He threw over her shoulders the wraps which he had brought, modest  wraps of common life, whose poverty contrasted with the elegance of the  ball dress. She felt this and wanted to escape so as not to be remarked  by the other women, who were "]]]
