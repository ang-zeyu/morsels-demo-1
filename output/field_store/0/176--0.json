CHAPTER I.    THE HISTORY OF THE CATHEDRAL.      Any attempt to write the history of a cathedral requires that the  subject shall be approached with two leading ideas in view. One of  these has reference to the history of a Church; the other to the story  of a building. The two aspects are clearly to be distinguished, but  their mutual relation may be better appreciated when we realise how  intimately they are bound together.    Ecclesiastical history, or \"ecclesiology,\" and architectural history,  or \"archaeology,\" do not exist apart; for the needs of Christian  liturgy indicated what arrangement was required in those buildings  that were peculiarly dedicated to the use of the Church; hence we  have, in the mere building itself, to consider the condition of  ecclesiastical and architectural growth displayed by its character  during each stage of its development, and this development, this  character, is to be discovered as well in the plan and structure of  the fabric, with its decorative details, as in the record that  documents and traditions have preserved. But we need to remember that  one see, one building, represents a link in one long continuing chain,  and in doing this we naturally look back as well as forward to observe  the relation of either to the past and to the present. Such an  attitude as this requires that we refer to that period when the  subject of this chapter was not yet part of the native soil of Sussex,  and in doing this we find that so early as the eighth century the town  of Chichester was even then a known centre of civil, though apparently  not ecclesiastical, activity; for it is not until about the middle of  the tenth century that some uncertain documentary evidence refers to  \"Bishop Brethelm and the brethren dwelling at Chichester.\" [1] It may  be that Brethelm was a bishop in, though not of, Chichester, who dwelt  and worked among the south Saxons living in and about the city, for  the history of the diocese and see will show that probably there was  no episcopate established under that name until a little more than one  hundred years later.      [1] Walcott, \"Early Statutes,\" p. 12.    Ceadwalla's foundation of the see at Selsea dated from about the end  of the seventh century; but we know nothing about any cathedral church  at that place during the following three hundred and fifty years. If,  however, there was a bishop in charge of the missionary priests,  deacons, and laymen who lived there together, there must necessarily  have been a \"cathedra\" in the church they used.    When Stigand came from Selsea to establish his see in Chichester he  found the city already furnished with a minster dedicated to S. Peter.  He had effected this transfer because the Council of London had  decided in 1075 that all the then village sees should be removed to  towns; and as there is no evidence of any attempt to provide a new  cathedral until about the year 1088, the existing minster must have  been appropriated for the see. It has been supposed that Stigand may  have devised some scheme for building a new church, and even that he  saw it carried out so far as to provide the foundations on which to  execute this idea. But there appears to be no authority which warrants  the assumption that he did even so much as this, for history says  nothing about such an early beginning of the new operations, tradition  asserts no more, and speculation suggests probabilities merely. We are  obliged, therefore, to be satisfied with the fact that the work begun  about 1088 was consecrated by Bishop Ralph de Luffa, in 1108, and it  is possible even now to see the stone which commemorates that ceremony  embedded in the walling of the present church. Unfortunately no more  than about six years had passed since this, the first, dedication,  when a fire occurred which burnt part of the fabric. Ralph was still  living, and began at once to repair the damage that had been done; and  the king (Henry I.) gave him much help by encouraging his endeavour.  What, then, had been accomplished during the twenty years between 1088  and 1108?    In 1075 Stigand transferred the see. About thirteen years later the  new cathedral building appears to have been begun under Ralph, and in  another twenty years so much had been finished as would allow him to  see it dedicated. It is probable that before this ceremony was  performed a considerable portion of the eastern section of the work  was finished; for in accordance with a general custom with the  mediaeval church builders, this part would have been that first begun.  But how much of it was ready for use? The sanctuary and presbytery, or  choir, with its necessary structural appendages, no doubt first  appeared. It may be that no more than this was ready when the  dedication took place. But it is not possible to say with any  authority what actually was finished. Nevertheless, the character of  the building itself explains the course in which the structure was  developed. After the first fire, in 1114, the work steadily continued,  and it is possible that before that mishap occurred, certain other  parts had been begun, if not finished. The remains of the original  nave still present distinct evidence to show that it was, with the  aisles, built in two sections; and these, although they appear at  first to be alike, prove upon closer examination that the four bays  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#1)"],[1,"COLLECTED  WORKS OF  AMBROSE BIERCE    VOLUME II      IN THE MIDST OF LIFE    TALES OF SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS        Originally Published 1909      PREFACE  TO THE FIRST EDITION      Denied existence by the chief publishing houses of the country, this  book owes itself to Mr. E.L.G.

He lay at  full length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head  upon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his  rifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a  slight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he  might have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of duty.  But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, death being the just  and legal penalty of his crime.    The clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road  which after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned  sharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred  yards. There it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward  through the forest. At the salient of that second angle was a large flat  rock, jutting out northward, overlooking the deep valley from which the  road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its  outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the  tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur  of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not  only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the  entire profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy  to look.    The country was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to  the northward, where there was a small natural meadow, through which  flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley's rim. This open ground  looked hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several  acres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing  forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon  which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and  through which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The  configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point of  observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered  how the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and  whence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the  meadow more than a thousand feet below.    No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theatre of  war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap, in  which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved  an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had  marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall  they would take to the road again, climb to the place where their  unfaithful sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the  ridge fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to  surprise it, for the road led to the rear of it. In case of failure,  their position would be perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely  would should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.    II    The sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young Virginian named  Carter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, an only child, and had  known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were  able to command in the mountain country of western Virginia. His home  was but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from  the breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely: \"Father, a Union  regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it.\"    The father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in  silence, and replied: \"Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you  conceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get  on without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak  further of the matter. Your mother, as the physician has informed you,  is in a most critical condition; at the best she cannot be with us  longer than a few weeks, but that time is precious. It would be better  not to disturb her.\"    So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who returned the  salute with a stately courtesy that masked a breaking heart, left the  home of his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by  deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows  and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of  the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at  the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than  resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a  dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a  movement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of  the late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate touched with  unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness--whispered into the ear  of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever  have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his  forehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the  laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his  rifle.    His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal pedestal,  the cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and  sharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of  impressive dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse,  straight and soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in  the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume  harmonized with its aerial background; the metal of accoutrement and  caparison was softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal's skin had  no points of high light. A carbine strikingly foreshortened lay across  the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right hand grasping it at  the \"grip\"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was invisible. In  silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with the  sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the  confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away,  showed only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to  the bottom of the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by  the soldier's testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the  group appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size.    For an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined feeling that he had  slept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art  reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of  which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a  slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had  drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained  immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of  the situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek  by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the  piece, and glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the  horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well  with Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and  looked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to"]]]
