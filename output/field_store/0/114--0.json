From Red River north  and all along was herd after herd waterbound by high water in the  rivers. Our outfit lay over nearly a week on the South Canadian, but  we were not alone, for there were five other herds waiting for the  river to go down. This river had tumbled over her banks for several  days, and the driftwood that was coming down would have made it  dangerous swimming for cattle.    We were expected to arrive in Dodge early in June, but when we reached  the North Fork of the Canadian, we were two weeks behind time.    Old George Carter, the owner of the herd, was growing very impatient  about us, for he had had no word from us after we had crossed Red  River at Doan's crossing. Other cowmen lying around Dodge, who had  herds on the trail, could hear nothing from their men, but in their  experience and confidence in their outfits guessed the cause--it was  water. Our surprise when we came opposite Camp Supply to have Carter  and a stranger ride out to meet us was not to be measured. They had  got impatient waiting, and had taken the mail buckboard to Supply,  making inquiries along the route for the _Hat_ herd, which had not  passed up the trail, so they were assured. Carter was so impatient  that he could not wait, as he had a prospective buyer on his hands,  and the delay in the appearing of the herd was very annoying to him.  Old George was as tickled as a little boy to meet us all.    The cattle were looking as fine as silk. The lay-overs had rested  them. The horses were in good trim, considering the amount of wet  weather we had had. Here and there was a nigger brand, but these  saddle galls were unavoidable when using wet blankets. The cattle were  twos and threes. We had left western Texas with a few over thirty-two  hundred head and were none shy. We could have counted out more, but on  some of them the Hat brand had possibly faded out. We went into a  cosy camp early in the evening. Everything needful was at hand, wood,  water, and grass. Cowmen in those days prided themselves on their  outfits, and Carter was a trifle gone on his men.    With the cattle on hand, drinking was out of the question, so the only  way to show us any regard was to bring us a box of cigars. He must  have brought those cigars from Texas, for they were wrapped in a copy  of the Fort Worth \"Gazette.\" It was a month old and full of news.  Every man in the outfit read and reread it. There were several train  robberies reported in it, but that was common in those days. They had  nominated for Governor \"The Little Cavalryman,\" Sol Ross, and this  paper estimated that his majority would be at least two hundred  thousand. We were all anxious to get home in time to vote for him.    Theodore Baughman was foreman of our outfit. Baugh was a typical  trail-boss. He had learned to take things as they came, play the cards  as they fell, and not fret himself about little things that could not  be helped. If we had been a month behind he would never have thought  to explain the why or wherefore to old man Carter. Several years after  this, when he was scouting for the army, he rode up to a herd over on  the Chisholm trail and asked one of the tail men: \"Son, have you  seen anything of about three hundred nigger soldiers?\" \"No,\" said the  cowboy. \"Well,\" said Baugh, \"I've lost about that many.\"    That night around camp the smoke was curling upward from those cigars  in clouds. When supper was over and the guards arranged for the night,  story-telling was in order. This cattle-buyer with us lived in Kansas  City and gave us several good ones. He told us of an attempted robbery  of a bank which had occurred a few days before in a western town. As a  prelude to the tale, he gave us the history of the robbers.    \"Cow Springs, Kansas,\" said he, \"earned the reputation honestly of  being a hard cow-town. When it became the terminus of one of the many  eastern trails, it was at its worst. The death-rate amongst its city  marshals--always due to a six-shooter in the hands of some man who  never hesitated to use it--made the office not over desirable. The  office was vacated so frequently in this manner that at last no local  man could be found who would have it. Then the city fathers sent to  Texas for a man who had the reputation of being a killer. He kept his  record a vivid green by shooting first and asking questions afterward.    \"Well, the first few months he filled the office of marshal he killed  two white men and an Indian, and had the people thoroughly buffaloed.  When the cattle season had ended and winter came on, the little town  grew tame and listless. There was no man to dare him to shoot, and  he longed for other worlds to conquer. He had won his way into public  confidence with his little gun. But this confidence reposed in him was  misplaced, for he proved his own double both in morals and courage.    \"To show you the limit of the confidence he enjoyed: the treasurer of  the Cherokee Strip Cattle Association paid rent money to that tribe,  at their capital, fifty thousand dollars quarterly. The capital is  not located on any railroad; so the funds in currency were taken in  regularly by the treasurer, and turned over to the tribal authorities.  This trip was always made with secrecy, and the marshal was taken  along as a trusted guard. It was an extremely dangerous trip to make,  as it was through a country infested with robbers and the capital at  least a hundred miles from the railroad. Strange no one ever attempted  to rob the stage or private conveyance, though this sum was taken in  regularly for several years. The average robber was careful of his  person, and could not be induced to make a target of himself for any  money consideration, where there was danger of a gun in the hands of a  man that would shoot rapidly and carelessly.    \"Before the herds began to reach as far north, the marshal and his  deputy gave some excuse and disappeared for a few days, which was  quite common and caused no comment. One fine morning the good people  of the town where the robbery was attempted were thrown into an uproar  by shooting in their bank, just at the opening hour. The robbers were  none other than our trusted marshal, his deputy, and a cow-puncher  who had been led into the deal. When they ordered the officials of  the bank to stand in a row with hands up, they were nonplused at their  refusal to comply. The attacked party unearthed ugly looking guns and  opened fire on the hold-ups instead.    \"This proved bad policy, for when the smoke cleared away the cashier,  a very popular man, was found dead, while an assistant was dangerously  wounded. The shooting, however, had aroused the town to the situation,  and men were seen running to and fro with guns. This unexpected  refusal and the consequent shooting spoiled the plans of the robbers,  so that they abandoned the robbery and ran to their horses.    \"After mounting they parleyed with each other a moment and seemed  bewildered as to which way they should ride, finally riding south  toward what seemed a broken country. Very few minutes elapsed before  every man who could find a horse was joining the posse that was  forming to pursue them. Before they were out of sight the posse had  started after them. They were well mounted and as determined a set of  men as were ever called upon to meet a similar emergency. They had the  decided advantage of the robbers, as their horses were fresh, and the  men knew every foot of the country.    \"The broken country to which the hold-ups headed was a delusion as far  as safety was concerned. They were never for a moment out of sight of  the pursuers, and this broken country ended in a deep coulee. When  the posse saw them enter this they knew that their capture was only a  matter of time.

J. HAMMOND TRUMBULL.         FOREWORD    The true story of witchcraft in old Connecticut has never been told. It  has been hidden in the ancient records and in manuscripts in private  collections, and those most conversant with the facts have not made them  known, for one reason or another. It is herein written from  authoritative sources, and should prove of interest and value as a  present-day interpretation of that strange delusion, which for a half  century darkened the lives of the forefathers and foremothers of the  colonial days.
