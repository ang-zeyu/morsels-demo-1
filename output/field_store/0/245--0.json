BOSTON  TICKNOR AND FIELDS    MDCCCLXVIII.        Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1856,  by CHARLES T. BROOKS,  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court  of the District of Rhode Island.    UNIVERSITY PRESS:  WELCH, BIGELOW, AND COMPANY,  CAMBRIDGE.          TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.      Perhaps some apology ought to be given to English scholars, that is, those  who do not know German, (to those, at least, who do not know what sort of  a thing Faust is in the original,) for offering another translation to the  public, of a poem which has been already translated, not only in a literal  prose form, but also, twenty or thirty times, in metre, and sometimes with  great spirit, beauty, and power.    The author of the present version, then, has no knowledge that a rendering  of this wonderful poem into the exact and ever-changing metre of the  original has, until now, been so much as attempted. To name only one  defect, the very best versions which he has seen neglect to follow the  exquisite artist in the evidently planned and orderly intermixing of  _male_ and _female_ rhymes, _i.e._ rhymes which fall on the last syllable  and those which fall on the last but one. Now, every careful student of  the versification of Faust must feel and see that Goethe did not  intersperse the one kind of rhyme with the other, at random, as those  translators do; who, also, give the female rhyme (on which the vivacity of  dialogue and description often so much depends,) in so small a proportion.    A similar criticism might be made of their liberty in neglecting Goethe's  method of alternating different measures with each other.    It seems as if, in respect to metre, at least, they had asked themselves,  how would Goethe have written or shaped this in English, had that been his  native language, instead of seeking _con amore_ (and _con fidelita_) as  they should have done, to reproduce, both in spirit and in form, the  movement, so free and yet orderly, of the singularly endowed and  accomplished poet whom they undertook to represent.    As to the objections which Hayward and some of his reviewers have  instituted in advance against the possibility of a good and faithful  metrical translation of a poem like Faust, they seem to the present  translator full of paradox and sophistry. For instance, take this  assertion of one of the reviewers: \"The sacred and mysterious union of  thought with verse, twin-born and immortally wedded from the moment of  their common birth, can never be understood by those who desire verse  translations of good poetry.\" If the last part of this statement had read  \"by those who can be contented with _prose_ translations of good poetry,\"  the position would have been nearer the truth. This much we might well  admit, that, if the alternative were either to have a poem like Faust in a  metre different and glaringly different from the original, or to have it  in simple and strong prose, then the latter alternative would be the one  every tasteful and feeling scholar would prefer; but surely to every one  who can read the original or wants to know how this great song _sung  itself_ (as Carlyle says) out of Goethe's soul, a mere prose rendering  must be, comparatively, a _corpus mortuum._    The translator most heartily dissents from Hayward's assertion that a  translator of Faust \"must sacrifice either metre or meaning.\" At least he  flatters himself that he has made, in the main, (not a compromise between  meaning and melody, though in certain instances he may have fallen into  that, but) a combination of the meaning with the melody, which latter is  so important, so vital a part of the lyric poem's meaning, in any worthy  sense. \"No poetic translation,\" says Hayward's reviewer, already quoted,  \"can give the rhythm and rhyme of the original; it can only substitute the  rhythm and rhyme of the translator.\" One might just as well say \"no  _prose_ translation can give the _sense and spirit_ of the original; it  can only substitute the _sense and spirit of the words and phrases of the  translator's language_;\" and then, these two assertions balancing each  other, there will remain in the metrical translator's favor, that he may  come as near to giving both the letter and the spirit, as the effects of  the Babel dispersion will allow.    As to the original creation, which he has attempted here to reproduce, the  translator might say something, but prefers leaving his readers to the  poet himself, as revealed in the poem, and to the various commentaries of  which we have some accounts, at least, in English. A French translator of  the poem speaks in his introduction as follows: \"This Faust, conceived by  him in his youth, completed in ripe age, the idea of which he carried with  him through all the commotions of his life, as Camoens bore his poem with  him through the waves, this Faust contains him entire. The thirst for  knowledge and the martyrdom of doubt, had they not tormented his early  years? Whence came to him the thought of taking refuge in a supernatural  realm, of appealing to invisible powers, which plunged him, for a  considerable time, into the dreams of Illuminati and made him even invent  a religion?  This irony of Mephistopheles, who carries on so audacious a  game with the weakness and the desires of man, is it not the mocking,  scornful side of the poet's spirit, a leaning to sullenness, which can be  traced even into the earliest years of his life, a bitter leaven thrown  into a strong soul forever by early satiety? The character of Faust  especially, the man whose burning, untiring heart can neither enjoy  fortune nor do without it, who gives himself unconditionally and watches  himself with mistrust, who unites the enthusiasm of passion and the  dejectedness of despair, is not this an eloquent opening up of the most  secret and tumultuous part of the poet's soul? And now, to complete the  image of his inner life, he has added the transcendingly sweet person of  Margaret, an exalted reminiscence of a young girl, by whom, at the age of  fourteen, he thought himself beloved, whose image ever floated round him,  and has contributed some traits to each of his heroines. This heavenly  surrender of a simple, good, and tender heart contrasts wonderfully with  the sensual and gloomy passion of the lover, who, in the midst of his  love-dreams, is persecuted by the phantoms of his imagination and by the  nightmares of thought, with those sorrows of a soul, which is crushed, but  not extinguished, which is tormented by the invincible want of happiness  and the bitter feeling, how hard a thing it is to receive or to bestow.\"          DEDICATION.[1]    Once more ye waver dreamily before me,  Forms that so early cheered my troubled eyes!  To hold you fast doth still my heart implore me?  Still bid me clutch the charm that lures and flies?  Ye crowd around! come, then, hold empire o'er me,  As from the mist and haze of thought ye rise;  The magic atmosphere, your train enwreathing,  Through my thrilled bosom youthful bliss is breathing.    Ye bring with you the forms of hours Elysian,  And shades of dear ones rise to meet my gaze;  First Love and Friendship steal upon my vision  Like an old tale of legendary days;  Sorrow renewed, in mournful repetition,  Runs through life's devious, labyrinthine ways;  And, sighing, names the good (by Fortune cheated  Of blissful hours!) who have before me fleeted.    These later songs of mine, alas! will never  Sound in their ears to whom the first were sung!  Scattered like dust, the friendly throng forever!  Mute the first echo that so grateful rung!  To the strange crowd I sing, whose very favor  Like chilling sadness on my heart is flung;  And all that kindled at those earlier numbers  Roams the wide earth or in its bosom slumbers.    And now I feel a long-unwonted yearning  For that calm, pensive spirit-realm, to-day;  Like an Aeolian lyre, (the breeze returning,)  Floats in uncertain tones my lisping lay;  Strange awe comes o'er me, tear on tear falls burning,  The rigid heart to milder mood gives way!  What I possess I see afar off lying,  And what I lost is real and undying.          PRELUDE    IN THE THEATRE.        _Manager. Dramatic Poet. Merry Person._    _Manager_. You who in trouble and distress  Have both held fast your old allegiance,  What think ye? here in German regions  Our enterprise may hope success?  To please the crowd my purpose has been steady,  Because they live and let one live at least.  The posts are set, the boards are laid already,  And every one is looking for a feast.  They sit, with lifted brows, composed looks wearing,  Expecting something that shall set them staring.  I know the public palate, that's confest;  Yet never pined so for a sound suggestion;  True, they are not accustomed to the best,  But they have read a dreadful deal, past question.  How shall we work to make all fresh and new,  Acceptable and profitable, too?  For sure I love to see the torrent boiling,  When towards our booth they crowd to find a place,  Now rolling on a space and then recoiling,  Then squeezing through the narrow door of grace:  Long before dark each one his hard-fought station  In sight of the box-office window takes,  And as, round bakers' doors men crowd to escape starvation,  For tickets here they almost break their necks.  This wonder, on so mixed a mass, the Poet  Alone can work; to-day, my friend, O, show it!    _Poet_. Oh speak not to me of that motley ocean,  Whose roar and greed the shuddering spirit chill!  Hide from my sight that billowy commotion  That draws us down the whirlpool 'gainst our will.  No, lead me to that nook of calm devotion,  Where blooms pure joy upon the Muses' hill;  Where love and friendship aye create and cherish,  With hand divine, heart-joys that never perish.

With An Introduction By Henry Morley Ll.d., Professor Of English  Literature At University College, London    London George Routledge And Sons    Broadway, Ludgate Hill    New York: 9 Lafayette Place    1884      INTRODUCTION.      Sir Walter Scott's \"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft\" were his  contribution to a series of books, published by John Murray, which  appeared between the years 1829 and 1847, and formed a collection of  eighty volumes known as \"Murray's Family Library.\" The series was  planned to secure a wide diffusion of good literature in cheap  five-shilling volumes, and Scott's \"Letters,\" written and published in  1830, formed one of the earlier books in the collection.    The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge had been founded in  the autumn of 1826, and Charles Knight, who had then conceived a plan of  a National Library, was entrusted, in July, 1827, with the  superintendence of its publications. Its first treatises appeared in  sixpenny numbers, once a fortnight. Its \"British Almanac\" and \"Companion  to the Almanac\" first appeared at the beginning of 1829. Charles Knight  started also in that year his own \"Library of Entertaining Knowledge.\"  John Murray's \"Family Library\" was then begun, and in the spring of  1832--the year of the Reform Bill--the advance of civilization by the  diffusion of good literature, through cheap journals as well as cheap  books, was sought by the establishment of \"Chambers's Edinburgh Journal\"  in the North, and in London of \"The Penny Magazine.\"    In the autumn of that year, 1832, on the 21st of September, Sir Walter  Scott died. The first warning of death had come to him in February,  1830, with a stroke of apoplexy. He had been visited by an old friend  who brought him memoirs of her father, which he had promised to revise  for the press. He seemed for half an hour to be bending over the papers  at his desk, and reading them; then he rose, staggered into the  drawing-room, and fell, remaining speechless until he had been bled.  Dieted for weeks on pulse and water, he so far recovered that to friends  outside his family but little change in him was visible. In that  condition, in the month after his seizure, he was writing these Letters,  and also a fourth series of the \"Tales of a Grandfather.\" The slight  softening of the brain found after death had then begun. But the old  delight in anecdote and skill in story-telling that, at the beginning of  his career, had caused a critic of his \"Border Minstrelsy\" to say that  it contained the germs of a hundred romances, yet survived. It gave to  Scott's \"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft\" what is for us now a  pathetic charm. Here and there some slight confusion of thought or style  represents the flickering of a light that flashes yet with its old  brilliancy. There is not yet the manifest suggestion of the loss of  power that we find presently afterwards in \"Count Robert of Paris\" and  \"Castle Dangerous,\" published in 1831 as the Fourth Series of \"Tales of  My Landlord,\" with which he closed his life's work at the age of sixty.    Milton has said that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write  well in laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem. Scott's life  was a true poem, of which the music entered into all he wrote. If in his  earlier days the consciousness of an unlimited productive power tempted  him to make haste to be rich, that he might work out, as founder of a  family, an ideal of life touched by his own genius of romance, there was  not in his desire for gain one touch of sordid greed, and his ideal of  life only brought him closer home to all its duties. Sir Walter Scott's  good sense, as Lord Cockburn said, was a more wonderful gift than his  genius. When the mistake of a trade connection with James Ballantyne  brought ruin to him in 1826, he repudiated bankruptcy, took on himself  the burden of a debt of L130,000, and sacrificed his life to the  successful endeavour to pay off all. What was left unpaid at his death  was cleared afterwards by the success of his annotated edition of his  novels. No tale of physical strife in the battlefield could be as heroic  as the story of the close of Scott's life, with five years of a  death-struggle against adversity, animated by the truest sense of  honour. When the ruin was impending he wrote in his diary, \"If things go  badly in London, the magic wand of the Unknown will be shivered in his  grasp. The feast of fancy will be over with the feeling of independence.  He shall no longer have the delight of waking in the morning with bright  ideas in his mind, hasten to commit them to paper, and count them  monthly, as the means of planting such scaurs and purchasing such  wastes; replacing dreams of fiction by other prospective visions of  walks by    'Fountain-heads, and pathless groves;   Places which pale passion loves.'    This cannot be; but I may work substantial husbandry--_i.e._ write  history, and such concerns.\" It was under pressure of calamity like this  that Sir Walter Scott was compelled to make himself known as the author  of \"Waverley.\" Closely upon this followed the death of his wife, his  thirty years' companion. \"I have been to her room,\" he wrote in May,  1826; \"there was no voice in it--no stirring; the pressure of the coffin  was visible on the bed, but it had been removed elsewhere; all was neat  as she loved it, but all was calm--calm as death. I remembered the last  sight of her: she raised herself in bed, and tried to turn her eyes  after me, and said with a sort of smile, 'You have all such melancholy  faces.' These were the last words I ever heard her utter, and I hurried  away, for she did not seem quite conscious of what she said; when I  returned, immediately departing, she was in a deep sleep. It is deeper  now. This was but seven days since. They are arranging the chamber of  death--that which was long the apartment of connubial happiness, and of  whose arrangement (better than in richer houses) she was so proud. They  are treading fast and thick. For weeks you could have heard a footfall.  Oh, my God!\"    A few years yet of his own battle, while the shadows of night and death  were gathering about him, and they were re-united. In these \"Letters  upon Demonology and Witchcraft,\" addressed to his son-in-law, written  under the first grasp of death, the old kindliness and good sense,  joined to the old charm in story-telling, stand firm yet against every  assault; and even in the decay that followed, when the powers were  broken of the mind that had breathed, and is still breathing, its own  health into the minds of tens of thousands of his countrymen, nothing  could break the fine spirit of love and honour that was in him. When the  end was very near, and the son-in-law to whom these Letters were  addressed found him one morning entirely himself, though in the last  extreme of feebleness: his eye was clear and calm--every trace of the  wild fire of delirium was extinguished: \"Lockhart,\" he said, \"I may have  but a minute to speak to you. My dear, be a good man--be virtuous, be  religious--be a good man. Nothing else will give you any comfort when  you come to lie here.\"    Another volume of this Library may give occasion to recall Scott in the  noontide of his strength, companion of    \"The blameless Muse who trains her sons   For hope and calm enjoyment.\"    Here we remember only how from among dark clouds the last light of his  genius shone on the path of those who were endeavouring to make the  daily bread of intellectual life--good books--common to all.
