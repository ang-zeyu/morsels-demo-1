Prayer the Greatest Outlet of Power        <u>Five Outlets of Power.</u>      A great sorrow has come into the heart of God. Let it be told only in  hushed voice--one of His worlds is _a prodigal_! Hush your voice yet  more--_ours_ is that prodigal world. Let your voice soften down still  more--_we_ have _consented_ to the prodigal part of the story. But, in  softest tones yet, He has won some of us back with His strong tender love.  And now let the voice ring out with great gladness--we won ones may be the  pathway back to God for the others. That is His earnest desire. That  should be our dominant ambition. For that purpose He has endowed us with  peculiar power.    There is one inlet of power in the life--anybody's life--any kind of  power: just one inlet--the Holy Spirit. He is power. He is in every one  who opens his door to God. He eagerly enters every open door. He comes in  by our invitation and consent. His presence within is the vital thing.    But with many of us while He is in, He is not in control: in as guest; not  as host. That is to say He is hindered in His natural movements; tied up,  so that He cannot do what He would. And so we are not conscious or only  partially conscious of His presence. And others are still less so. But to  yield to His mastery, to cultivate His friendship, to give Him full  swing--that will result in what is called power. One inlet of power--the  Holy Spirit in control.    There are five outlets of power: five avenues through which this One  within shows Himself, and reveals His power.    First: through the life, what we are. Just simply what we are. If we be  right the power of God will be constantly flowing out, though we be not  conscious of it. It throws the keenest kind of emphasis on a man being  right in his life. There will be an eager desire to serve. Yet we may  constantly do more in what we are than in what we do. We may serve better  in the lives we live than in the best service we ever give. The memory of  that should bring rest to your spirit when a bit tired, and may be  disheartened because tired.    Second: through the lips, what we say. It may be said stammeringly and  falteringly. But if said your best with the desire to please the Master it  will be God-blest. I have heard a man talk. And he stuttered and blushed  and got his grammar badly tangled, but my heart burned as I listened. And  I have heard a man talk with smooth speech, and it rolled off me as easily  as it rolled out of him. Do your best, and leave the rest. If we are in  touch with God His fire burns whether the tongue stammer or has good  control of its powers.    Third: through our service, what we do. It may be done bunglingly and  blunderingly. Your best may not be the best, but if it be your best it  will bring a harvest.    Fourth: through our money, what we do not keep, but loosen out for God.  Money comes the nearest to omnipotence of anything we handle.    And, fifth: through our prayer, what we claim in Jesus' name.    And by all odds the greatest of these is the outlet through prayer. The  power of a life touches just one spot, but the touch is tremendous. What  is there we think to be compared with a pure, unselfish, gently strong  life. Yet its power is limited to one spot where it is being lived. Power  through the lips depends wholly upon the life back of the lips. Words that  come brokenly are often made burning and eloquent by the life behind them.  And words that are smooth and easy, often have all their meaning sapped by  the life back of them. Power through service may be great, and may be  touching many spots, yet it is always less than that of a life. Power  through money depends wholly upon the motive back of the money. Begrudged  money, stained money, soils the treasury. That which comes nearest to  omnipotence also comes nearest to impotence. But the power loosened out  through prayer is as tremendous, at the least, to say no more just now, is  as tremendous as the power of a true fragrant life and, mark you, _and_,  may touch not one spot but wherever in the whole round world you may  choose to turn it.    The greatest thing any one can do for God and for man is to pray. It is  not the only thing. But it is the chief thing. A correct balancing of the  possible powers one may exert puts it first. For if a man is to pray  right, he must first _be_ right in his motives and life. And if a man _be_  right, and put the practice of praying in its right place, then his  serving and giving and speaking will be fairly fragrant with the presence  of God.    The great people of the earth to-day are the people who pray. I do not  mean those who talk about prayer; nor those who say they believe in  prayer; nor yet those who can explain about prayer; but I mean these  people who _take_ time and _pray_. They have not time. It must be taken  from something else. This something else is important. Very important, and  pressing than prayer. There are people that put prayer first, and group  the other items in life's schedule around and after prayer.    These are the people to-day who are doing the most for God; in winning  souls; in solving problems; in awakening churches; in supplying both men  and money for mission posts; in keeping fresh and strong these lives far  off in sacrificial service on the foreign field where the thickest  fighting is going on; in keeping the old earth sweet awhile longer.    It is wholly a secret service. We do not know who these people are, though  sometimes shrewd guesses may be made. I often think that sometimes we pass  some plain-looking woman quietly slipping out of church; gown been turned  two or three times; bonnet fixed over more than once; hands that have not  known much of the softening of gloves; and we hardly giver her a passing  thought, and do not know, nor guess, that perhaps _she_ is the one who is  doing far more for her church, and for the world, and for God than a  hundred who would claim more attention and thought, _because she prays_;  truly prays as the Spirit of God inspires and guides.    Let me put it this way: God will do as a result of the praying of the  humblest one here what otherwise He _would_ not do. Yes, I can make it  stronger than that, and I must make it stronger, for the Book does.  Listen: God will do in answer to the prayer of the weakest one here what  otherwise he _could_ not do. \"Oh!\" someone thinks, \"you are getting that  too strong now.\" Well, you listen to Jesus' own words in that last long  quiet talk He had with the eleven men between the upper room and the  olive-green. John preserves much of that talk for us. Listen: \"Ye did not  choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear  fruit, and that your fruit should abide: that\"--listen, a part of the  purpose why we have been chosen--\"that whatsoever ye shall ask of the  Father in My name, He _may_ give it you.\"[1] Mark that word \"may\"; not  \"shall\" this time but _may_. \"Shall\" throws the matter over on God--His  purpose. \"May\" throws it over upon us--our cooperation. That is to say our  praying makes it possible for God to do what otherwise He could not do.    And if you think into it a bit, this fits in with the true conception of  prayer. In its simplest analysis prayer--all prayer--has, must have, two  parts. First, a God to give. \"Yes,\" you say, \"certainly, a God wealthy,  willing, all of that.\" And, just as certainly, there must be a second  factor, _a man to receive_. Man's willingness is God's channel to the  earth. God never crowds nor coerces. Everything God does for man and  through man He does with man's consent, always. With due reverence, but  very plainly, let it be said that God can do nothing for the man with shut  hand and shut life. There must be an open hand and heart and life  _through_ which God can give what He longs to. An open life, an open hand,  open upward, is the pipe line of communication between the heart of God  and this poor befooled old world. Our prayer is God's opportunity to get  into the world that would shut Him out.        <u>In touch with a planet.</u>      Prayer opens a whole planet to a man's activities. I can as really be  touching hearts for God in far away India or China through prayer, as  though I were there. Not in as many ways as though there, but as truly.  Understand me, I think the highest possible _privilege_ of service is in  those far off lands. There the need is greatest, the darkness densest, and  the pleading call most eloquently pathetic. And if one _may_ go  there--happy man!--if one be _privileged_ to go to the honoured place of  service he may then use all five outlets direct in the spot where he is.    Yet this is only one spot. But his relationship is as wide as his Master's  and his sympathies should be. A man may be in Africa, but if his heart be  in touch with Jesus it will be burning for _a world_."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co.

Eighteen years ago, the first edition of this book, \"Co. H., First  Tennessee Regiment,\" was published by the author, Mr. Sam. R. Watkins,  of Columbia, Tenn.  A limited edition of two thousand copies was printed  and sold.  For nearly twenty years this work has been out of print and  the owners of copies of it hold them so precious that it is impossible to  purchase one.  To meet a demand, so strong as to be almost irresistable  the Chattanooga Times has printed a second edition of 2000 copies,  which to soldiers of the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the  Cumberland, between whom many battles were fought, it will prove of  intense interest, serving to recall many scenes and incidents of battle  field and camp in which they were the chief actors.  To them and to all  other readers we respectfully commend this book as being the best and  most impersonal history of any army ever written.

L. Yancy--I write only  from memory, and this was a long time ago--took a strange and peculiar  notion that the sun rose in the east and set in the west, and that the  compass pointed north and south.  Now, everybody knew at the time that  it was but the idiosyncrasy of an unbalanced mind, and that the United  States of America had no north, no south, no east, no west.  Well,  he began to preach the strange doctrine of there being such a thing.  He began to have followers.  As you know, it matters not how absurd,  ridiculous and preposterous doctrines may be preached, there will be some  followers.  Well, one man by the name of (I think it was) Rhett, said it  out loud.  He was told to \"s-h-e-e.\"  Then another fellow by the name (I  remember this one because it sounded like a graveyard) Toombs said so,  and he was told to \"sh-sh-ee-ee.\"  Then after a while whole heaps of  people began to say that they thought that there was a north and a south;  and after a while hundreds and thousands and millions said that there was  a south.  But they were the persons who lived in the direction that the  water courses run.  Now, the people who lived where the water courses  started from came down to see about it, and they said, \"Gents, you are  very much mistaken.  We came over in the Mayflower, and we used to burn  witches for saying that the sun rose in the east and set in the west,  because the sun neither rises nor sets, the earth simply turns on its  axis, and we know, because we are Pure(i)tans.\"  The spokesman of the  party was named (I think I remember his name because it always gave me  the blues when I heard it) Horrors Greeley; and another person by the  name of Charles Sumner, said there ain't any north or south, east or west,  and you shan't say so, either.  Now, the other people who lived in the  direction that the water courses run, just raised their bristles and  continued saying that there is a north and there is a south.  When those  at the head of the water courses come out furiously mad, to coerce those  in the direction that water courses run, and to make them take it back.  Well, they went to gouging and biting, to pulling and scratching at a  furious rate.  One side elected a captain by the name of Jeff Davis,  and known as one-eyed Jeff, and a first lieutenant by the name of Aleck  Stephens, commonly styled Smart Aleck.  The other side selected as  captain a son of Nancy Hanks, of Bowling Green, and a son of old Bob  Lincoln, the rail-splitter, and whose name was Abe.  Well, after he  was elected captain, they elected as first lieutenant an individual of  doubtful blood by the name of Hannibal Hamlin, being a descendant of the  generation of Ham, the bad son of old Noah, who meant to curse him blue,  but overdid the thing, and cursed him black.    Well, as I said before, they went to fighting, but old Abe's side got  the best of the argument.  But in getting the best of the argument they  called in all the people and wise men of other nations of the earth,  and they, too, said that America had no cardinal points, and that the sun  did not rise in the east and set in the west, and that the compass did  not point either north or south.    Well, then, Captain Jeff Davis' side gave it up and quit, and they, too,  went to saying that there is no north, no south, no east, no west.  Well, \"us boys\" all took a small part in the fracas, and Shep, the  prophet, remarked that the day would come when those who once believed  that the American continent had cardinal points would be ashamed to own  it.  That day has arrived.  America has no north, no south, no east,  no west; the sun rises over the hills and sets over the mountains,  the compass just points up and down, and we can laugh now at the absurd  notion of there being a north and a south.    Well, reader, let me whisper in your ear.  I was in the row, and the  following pages will tell what part I took in the little unpleasant  misconception of there being such a thing as a north and south.      THE BLOODY CHASM    In these memoirs, after the lapse of twenty years, we propose to fight  our \"battles o'er again.\"    To do this is but a pastime and pleasure, as there is nothing that so  much delights the old soldier as to revisit the scenes and battlefields  with which he was once so familiar, and to recall the incidents, though  trifling "]]]
