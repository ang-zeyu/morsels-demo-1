BRITLING      Section 1    It was the sixth day of Mr. Direck's first visit to England, and he was  at his acutest perception of differences. He found England in every way  gratifying and satisfactory, and more of a contrast with things American  than he had ever dared to hope.    He had promised himself this visit for many years, but being of a sunny  rather than energetic temperament--though he firmly believed himself  to be a reservoir of clear-sighted American energy--he had allowed all  sorts of things, and more particularly the uncertainties of Miss Mamie  Nelson, to keep him back. But now there were no more uncertainties about  Miss Mamie Nelson, and Mr. Direck had come over to England just to  convince himself and everybody else that there were other interests  in life for him than Mamie....    And also, he wanted to see the old country from which his maternal  grandmother had sprung. Wasn't there even now in his bedroom in New York  a water-colour of Market Saffron church, where the dear old lady had  been confirmed? And generally he wanted to see Europe. As an interesting  side show to the excursion he hoped, in his capacity of the rather  underworked and rather over-salaried secretary of the Massachusetts  Society for the Study of Contemporary Thought, to discuss certain  agreeable possibilities with Mr. Britling, who lived at Matching's Easy.    Mr. Direck was a type of man not uncommon in America. He was very much  after the fashion of that clean and pleasant-looking person one sees in  the advertisements in American magazines, that agreeable person who  smiles and says, \"Good, it's the Fizgig Brand,\" or \"Yes, it's a Wilkins,  and that's the Best,\" or \"My shirt-front never rucks; it's a Chesson.\"  But now he was saying, still with the same firm smile, \"Good. It's  English.\" He was pleased by every unlikeness to things American, by  every item he could hail as characteristic; in the train to London he  had laughed aloud with pleasure at the chequer-board of little fields  upon the hills of Cheshire, he had chuckled to find himself in a  compartment without a corridor; he had tipped the polite yet kindly  guard magnificently, after doubting for a moment whether he ought to tip  him at all, and he had gone about his hotel in London saying \"Lordy!  Lordy! My _word!_\" in a kind of ecstasy, verifying the delightful  absence of telephone, of steam-heat, of any dependent bathroom. At  breakfast the waiter (out of Dickens it seemed) had refused to know what  \"cereals\" were, and had given him his egg in a china egg-cup such as you  see in the pictures in _Punch_. The Thames, when he sallied out to see  it, had been too good to be true, the smallest thing in rivers he had  ever seen, and he had had to restrain himself from affecting a marked  accent and accosting some passer-by with the question, \"Say! But is this  little wet ditch here the Historical River Thames?\"    In America, it must be explained, Mr. Direck spoke a very good and  careful English indeed, but he now found the utmost difficulty in  controlling his impulse to use a high-pitched nasal drone and indulge in  dry \"Americanisms\" and poker metaphors upon all occasions. When people  asked him questions he wanted to say \"Yep\" or \"Sure,\" words he would no  more have used in America than he could have used a bowie knife. But he  had a sense of role. He wanted to be visibly and audibly America  eye-witnessing. He wanted to be just exactly what he supposed an  Englishman would expect him to be. At any rate, his clothes had been  made by a strongly American New York tailor, and upon the strength of  them a taxi-man had assumed politely but firmly that the shillings on  his taximeter were dollars, an incident that helped greatly to sustain  the effect of Mr. Direck, in Mr. Direck's mind, as something standing  out with an almost representative clearness against the English  scene.... So much so that the taxi-man got the dollars....    Because all the time he had been coming over he had dreaded that it  wasn't true, that England was a legend, that London would turn out to be  just another thundering great New York, and the English exactly like New  Englanders....      Section 2    And now here he was on the branch line of the little old Great Eastern  Railway, on his way to Matching's Easy in Essex, and he was suddenly in  the heart of Washington Irving's England.    Washington Irving's England! Indeed it was. He couldn't sit still and  just peep at it, he had to stand up in the little compartment and stick  his large, firm-featured, kindly countenance out of the window as if he  greeted it. The country under the June sunshine was neat and bright as  an old-world garden, with little fields of corn surrounded by dog-rose  hedges, and woods and small rushy pastures of an infinite tidiness. He  had seen a real deer park, it had rather tumbledown iron gates between  its shield-surmounted pillars, and in the distance, beyond all question,  was Bracebridge Hall nestling among great trees. He had seen thatched  and timbered cottages, and half-a-dozen inns with creaking signs. He had  seen a fat vicar driving himself along a grassy lane in a governess cart  drawn by a fat grey pony. It wasn't like any reality he had ever known.  It was like travelling in literature.    Mr. Britling's address was the Dower House, and it was, Mr. Britling's  note had explained, on the farther edge of the park at Claverings.  Claverings! The very name for some stately home of England....    And yet this was only forty-two miles from London. Surely it brought  things within the suburban range. If Matching's Easy were in America,  commuters would live there. But in supposing that, Mr. Direck displayed  his ignorance of a fact of the greatest importance to all who would  understand England. There is a gap in the suburbs of London. The suburbs  of London stretch west and south and even west by north, but to the  north-eastward there are no suburbs; instead there is Essex. Essex is  not a suburban county; it is a characteristic and individualised county  which wins the heart. Between dear Essex and the centre of things lie  two great barriers, the East End of London and Epping Forest. Before a  train could get to any villadom with a cargo of season-ticket holders it  would have to circle about this rescued woodland and travel for twenty  unprofitable miles, and so once you are away from the main Great Eastern  lines Essex still lives in the peace of the eighteenth century, and  London, the modern Babylon, is, like the stars, just a light in the  nocturnal sky. In Matching's Easy, as Mr. Britling presently explained  to Mr. Direck, there are half-a-dozen old people who have never set eyes  on London in their lives--and do not want to.    \"Aye-ya!\"    \"Fussin' about thea.\"    \"Mr. Robinson, 'e went to Lon', 'e did. That's 'ow 'e 'urt 'is fut.\"    Mr. Direck had learnt at the main-line junction that he had to tell the  guard to stop the train for Matching's Easy; it only stopped \"by  request\"; the thing was getting better and better; and when Mr. Direck  seized his grip and got out of the train there was just one little old  Essex station-master and porter and signalman and everything, holding a  red flag in his hand and talking to Mr. Britling about the cultivation  of the sweet peas which glorified the station. And there was the Mr.  Britling who was the only item of business and the greatest expectation  in Mr. Direck's European journey, and he was quite unlike the portraits  Mr. Direck had seen and quite unmistakably Mr. Britling all the same,  since there was nobody else upon the platform, and he was advancing with  a gesture of welcome.    \"Did you ever see such peas, Mr. Dick?\" said Mr. Britling by way of  introduction.    \"My _word_,\" said Mr. Direck in a good old Farmer Hayseed kind of voice.    \"Aye-ya!\" said the station-master in singularly strident tones. \"It be a  rare year for sweet peas,\" and then he slammed the door of the carriage  in a leisurely manner and did dismissive things with his flag, while the  two gentlemen took stock, as people say, of one another.      Section 3    Except in the doubtful instance of Miss Mamie Nelson, Mr. Direck's habit  was good fortune. Pleasant things came to him. Such was his position as  the salaried secretary of this society of thoughtful Massachusetts  business men to which allusion has been made. Its purpose was to bring  itself expeditiously into touch with the best thought of the age.    Too busily occupied with practical realities to follow the thought of  the age through all its divagations and into all its recesses, these  Massachusetts business men had had to consider methods of access more  quintessential and nuclear. And they had decided not to hunt out the  best thought in its merely germinating stages, but to wait until it had  emerged and flowered to some trustworthy recognition, and then, rather  than toil through recondite and possibly already reconsidered books and  writings generally, to offer an impressive fee to the emerged new  thinker, and to invite him to come to them and to lecture to them and to  have a conference with them, and to tell them simply, competently and  completely at first hand just all that he was about.

So-called Moslem missionaries are spreading through the Press such  idealistic and false views of the religion and character of Mohammed,  that we need to be on our guard against them.    Unbiased historians have stated that there is much that is deplorable  in the life of the prophet of Islam. And it is certain that his  teaching has increased the degradation of the nations that have come  under its influence.    Much of the literature that is being circulated in England by the  \"Moslem missionaries,\" claims that Moslem women are better off, so far  as property rights go, than their Christian sisters. However true this  may be, it does not lift them out of the degradation of polygamy and  concubinage, with a capricious system of divorce, which makes them the  victims of the selfish baseness of their husbands and masters, which  Mohammed himself sanctioned.    The following essay, it is hoped, will help to counteract the false  ideas that are being scattered abroad, and lead those who read to  study more deeply the problems and sorrows of millions of the Moslem  subjects of our Gracious King.    The prayers of all Christians are asked on behalf of these millions,  and for those who labour to preach the \"unsearchable riches of Christ\"  amongst them.    H.E.E. HAYES.    GREENHITHE:    July, 1914.          MOHAMMED    The Prophet of Islam.    By H.E.E. HAYES.    INTRODUCTION.      Just as the character of Jesus is stamped upon the religion which  originated in His Person, so is the character of Mohammed impressed  upon the system which he, with marvellous ingenuity, founded. The  practical influence of Islam upon individual lives produces results  that reflect unmistakably the character of its founder, and a careful  study of the tenets of the system in relation to its history enable  the student to estimate the real worth of the man.    As the Apostle of God, Mohammed is the ideal of every true Moslem. His  life is the standard by which the lives of his followers are tested,  although he himself confesses that his life was not holy. In the  Koran, and the earlier traditions, he is pictured as being in no way  better than his fellows, and as weak and liable to error as the  poorest of his contemporaries. Yet later tradition minimises his  faults and weakness, and surrounds his person with a halo of glory  that makes him appear sinless and almost divine. All the doubtful  incidents of his life are either eliminated and ignored, or  assiduously supported and defended by his pious, misguided followers.    It is a point in his favour that he never claimed infallibility for  his actions or opinions; and his habit of attempting to cover or  justify his glaring faults by suitable revelations, although  indefensibly immoral, reveals the fact that he was conscious of his  own shortcomings. When he was at the zenith of his power, \"revelation\"  became merely an instrument of self glorification, licensing him in  every whim and fancy, because it gave him, as the prophet of God,  exemption from all law and order. His scheme was characteristically  ingenious and immoral. Had he known of the divine effulgence with  which he was afterwards encircled by his fanatical followers, he  would, in all probability, have strongly discountenanced it. The  incongruous sanctity with which his commonplace utterances and petty  actions were invested would have caused fear lest it became derogatory  to his creed of divine unity.        TRADITION.      As a source of information, the traditions are obviously unreliable,  for they are coloured by the excessive zeal and irrational bias of  men whose judgment was warped by irrepressible fanaticism. They  attributed to their hero elements that are grotesquely impossible. His  advent was in their estimation, so portentous that it was celebrated  by events which, for the time, upset all natural law. And his whole  life has been linked with miraculous happenings of a most ludicrous  type. More reasonable men have exalted the prophet because they have  convinced themselves that he was what he ought to have been. This may  account for the pious confidence of some of the more intelligent, who,  accepting tradition as historical, have exalted their hero to the  ideal, and have received the imagined glory as real. This tendency to  exalt their master is well illustrated by the maxim of Shafy--\"In the  exaltation of Mohammed it is lawful to exaggerate\"--a maxim invaluable  to men who were seeking to glorify the prophet, and the usefulness of  which was fully appreciated by the legislators and doctors when they  were called upon to cope with the new relations and exigencies that  came into being after his death. The conquests and progress of Islam  necessitated almost daily the framing of new rules, while in the  application of the old, constant modification and adaptation were  required. To meet these needs, actual or supposed sayings and actions  of the prophet were eagerly sought after, and, in time, with the  growth of a professional body of traditionalists, all legitimate  sources being exhausted, that which was doubtful, and even disputed,  was accepted as authentic and reliable. Imagination augmented the  legitimate springs of information, and the result was an exhaustive  accumulation of precedents for every possible circumstance.    Sprenger, in his essay on \"Tradition,\" regarding the value and nature  of the material needed for compiling a life of Mohammed, says:         \"During the stir and activity of the first sixty years, thousands       and thousands occupied themselves with handing down traditions. In       every mosque they committed them to memory, and rehearsed them in       every social gathering. All such knowledge was the common property       of the nation; it was learned by heart and transmitted orally. It       possessed, therefore, in the highest possible degree, the elements       of life and plasticity. Bunson has discovered the divinity of the       Bible in its always having been the people's book. If this       criterion be decisive, then no religion has better claim to be       called the 'vox Dei,' because none is in so full a sense the 'vox       populi.' The creations of the period we have been considering       possess this character for hundreds of millions of our fellow men;       for modern Islamism is as far removed from the spirit in which the       Coran was composed, as Catholicism is from the spirit of the       Gospel; and modern Islamism is grounded upon tradition. But in       tradition we find nothing but the Ideal, Invention, Fancy,       Historical facts, however they may have been floating among the       people in the days if Ibn 'Abbas, and the other founders of       genealogy, were trodden under feet, because men wished to remove       every barrier which stood in the way of self-glorification. And of       the thousand inventions which every day gave birth to, only those       were recognised as true which most flattered the religious and       national pride ...\"    He also goes on to say:         \"The time of creative"]]]
