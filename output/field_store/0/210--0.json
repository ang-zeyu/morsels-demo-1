BARNES  HARLAN H. BALLARD  S. PROCTOR THAYER    NEW YORK--CINCINNATI--CHICAGO  AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY    1888, by A.S. BARNES & CO.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: PREFACE]    The authors of this book believe,--    1st.--_That the Word Method is the most natural and practicable,_  because words are representatives of objects, actions, etc., while  letters, or sounds, in the abstract, convey no meaning to the pupil, and  are devoid of interest.    2d.--_That words of ordinary length are as easily learned as short ones,  provided they are familiar to the pupil_. No teacher will doubt the  statement that a pupil will learn the word \"mamma'\" as easily as \"says\"  or \"eyes.\"    3d.--_That frequent \"Reviews\" are essential to the rapid and thorough  advancement of pupils_. By this means the words imperfectly learned  are again brought to their attention and thoroughly memorized. That  these \"Reviews\" ought to take up the new words in a different order and  arrangement, in order to test the ability of the pupil to recognize them  in any situation. That as soon as the vocabulary is large enough they  should be written in the form of a new exercise, as on pp. 36, 44, 52,  60, and 68 of this book.  4th.--_That thorough and systematic drill in  Spelling is absolutely necessary_. That the \"Reading Reviews\" should  be so constructed as to contain all the new words used in the lessons  they were intended to review, and no others, so that they can be used  for \"Written or Dictation Spelling.\" That the pronunciation of the words  in the \"Spelling Reviews\" should be indicated by the diacritical marks  of Webster, so that they can be used for either \"Oral Spelling\" or  \"Phonic Drill.\"    5th.--_That the \"Script\" from which the pupil gets his first and most  lasting impressions should be of large size and accurate form_, and  not of the nondescript character usually found in books of this class.  That it should be free from superfluous line and flourish, and yet have  grace and beauty. That it should be adapted for both copying and  reading.    6th.--_That the lessons should be largely \"conversational in style,\"_  to cultivate flexibility of voice and to break up the dreary monotone so  frequently heard among children.    7th.--_That the lessons of a book of this grade should not average more  than seven \"new words.\"_ That all such words should appear at the  commencement of lessons, and be familiar to the pupil. That this method  secures careful gradation, and is in marked contrast with the old custom  of having from fifteen to twenty-five.    8th.--_That \"Outline Drawings\" of the objects first presented to pupils  should be made in the presence of the class_, as it stimulates them to  draw, and thus makes easy and profitable the copying of the \"Script  Exercises.\"    9th.--_That the schoolbook of to-day must be beautifully and copiously  illustrated_. That there must be variety as well as excellence, both in  drawing and engraving. That well-known and famous artists must be  secured, such as Harper, Fredericks, Church, Lippincott, Eytinge, White,  Beard, Weldon, Thulstrup, Cary, Moser, Weaver, and Share; and such  engravers as Karst, Wigand, French, Held, Davis, Hellawell, etc.    10th.--_That the exercises must be instructive as well as interesting,_  and that no artificial system of vowel classification ought to interfere  with the free and natural use of words.    11th.--_That a book of this kind should be suited to the wants of graded  and ungraded schools_, there evidently being nothing in the one not  readily adaptable to the other.    12th.--_That every book of this class should contain a collection of  brief extracts from standard literature_ to be committed to memory.    13th.--_That this book is constructed on the above principles_.

[Illustration: MISSION SAN LUIS REY, PARTLY RESTORED.]    [Illustration: MISSION SAN LUIS REY.  Showing monastery recently built behind the old Mission arches.]          The  Old Franciscan Missions  of California    BY    GEORGE WHARTON JAMES    Author of \"In and Around the Grand Canyon,\" \"Heroes of  California,\" \"Through Ramona's Country,\" Etc.    _With Illustrations from Photographs_    1913          Dedication    To those good men and women, of all creeds and of no creed, whose lives  have shown forth the glories of beautiful, helpful, unselfish,  sympathetic humanity:    To those whose love and life are larger than all creeds and who discern  the manifestation of God in all men:    To those who are urging forward the day when profession will give place  to endeavor, and, in the real life of a genuine brotherhood of man, and  true recognition of the All-Fatherhood of God, all men, in spite of  their diversities, shall unite in their worship and thus form the real  Catholic Church:    Especially to these, and to all who appreciate nobleness in others I  lovingly dedicate these pages, devoted to a recital of the life and work  of godly and unselfish men.        Foreword    The story of the Old Missions of California is perennially new. The  interest in the ancient and dilapidated buildings and their history  increases with each year. To-day a thousand visit them where ten saw  them twenty years ago, and twenty years hence, hundreds of thousands  will stand in their sacred precincts, and unconsciously absorb beautiful  and unselfish lessons of life as they hear some part of their history  recited. It is well that this is so. A materially inclined nation needs  to save every unselfish element in its history to prevent its going to  utter destruction. It is essential to our spiritual development that we  learn that         \"Not on the vulgar mass       Called 'work,' must sentence pass,       Things done, that took the eye and had the price;       O'er which, from level stand,       The low world laid its hand,       Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice.\"    It is of incalculably greater benefit to the race that the Mission  Fathers lived and had their fling of divine audacity for the good of the  helpless aborigines than that any score one might name of the  \"successful captains of industry\" lived to make their unwieldy and  topheavy piles of gold. With all their faults and failures, all their  ideas of theology and education,--which we, in our assumed superiority,  call crude and old-fashioned,--all their rude notions of sociology, all  their errors and mistakes, the work of the Franciscan Fathers was  glorified by unselfish aim, high motive and constant and persistent  endeavor to bring their heathen wards into a knowledge of saving grace.  It was a brave and heroic endeavor. It is easy enough to find fault, to  criticize, to carp, but it is not so easy to _do_. These men _did_! They  had a glorious purpose which they faithfully pursued. They aimed high  and achieved nobly. The following pages recite both their aims and their  achievements, and neither can be understood without a thrilling of the  pulses, a quickening of the heart's beats, and a stimulating of the  soul's ambitions.    This volume pretends to nothing new in the way of historical research or  scholarship. It is merely an honest and simple attempt to meet a real  and popular demand for an unpretentious work that shall give the  ordinary tourist and reader enough of the history of the Missions to  make a visit to them of added interest, and to link their history with  that of the other Missions founded elsewhere in the country during the  same or prior epochs of Mission activity.    If it leads others to a greater reverence for these outward and visible  signs of the many and beautiful graces that their lives developed in the  hearts of the Franciscan Fathers--their founders and builders--and gives  the information needed, its purpose will be more than fulfilled.    In most of its pages it is a mere condensation of the author's _In and  Out of the Old Missions of California,_ to which book the reader who  desires further and more detailed information is respectfully referred.
