INTRODUCTION    After the great war it is difficult, to point out a single nation that  is happy; but this has come out of the war, that there is not a single  nation outside India, that is not either free or striving to be free.    It is said that we, too, are on the road to freedom, that it is better  to be on the certain though slow course of gradual unfoldment of freedom  than to take the troubled and dangerous path of revolution whether  peaceful or violent, and that the new Reforms are a half-way house  to freedom.    The new constitution granted to India keeps all the military forces,  both in the direction and in the financial control, entirely outside the  scope of responsibility to the people of India. What does this mean? It  means that the revenues of India are spent away on what the nation does  not want. But after the mid-Eastern complications and the fresh Asiatic  additions to British Imperial spheres of action. This Indian military  servitude is a clear danger to national interests.    The new constitution gives no scope for retrenchment and therefore no  scope for measures of social reform except by fresh taxation, the heavy  burden of which on the poor will outweigh all the advantages of any  reforms. It maintains all the existing foreign services, and the cost of  the administrative machinery high as it already is, is further  increased.    The reformed constitution keeps all the fundamental liberties of person,  property, press, and association completely under bureaucratic control.  All those laws which give to the irresponsible officers of the Executive  Government of India absolute powers to override the popular will, are  still unrepealed. In spite of the tragic price paid in the Punjab for  demonstrating the danger of unrestrained power in the hands of a foreign  bureaucracy and the inhumanity of spirit by which tyranny in a panic  will seek to save itself, we stand just where we were before, at the  mercy of the Executive in respect of all our fundamental liberties.    Not only is Despotism intact in the Law, but unparalleled crimes and  cruelties against the people have been encouraged and even after  boastful admissions and clearest proofs, left unpunished. The spirit of  unrepentant cruelty has thus been allowed to permeate the whole  administration.      THE MUSSALMAN AGONY    To understand our present condition it is not enough to realise the  general political servitude. We should add to it the reality and the  extent of the injury inflicted by Britain on Islam, and thereby on the  Mussalmans of India. The articles of Islamic faith which it is necessary  to understand in order to realise why Mussalman India, which was once so  loyal is now so strongly moved to the contrary are easily set out and  understood. Every religion should be interpreted by the professors of  that religion. The sentiments and religious ideas of Muslims founded on  the traditions of long generations cannot be altered now by logic or  cosmopolitanism, as others understand it. Such an attempt is the more  unreasonable when it is made not even as a bonafide and independent  effort of proselytising logic or reason, but only to justify a treaty  entered into for political and worldly purposes.    The Khalifa is the authority that is entrusted with the duty of  defending Islam. He is the successor to Muhammad and the agent of God on  earth. According to Islamic tradition he must possess sufficient  temporal power effectively to protect Islam against non-Islamic powers  and he should be one elected or accepted by the Mussalman world.    The Jazirat-ul-Arab is the area bounded by the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea,  the Persian Gulf, and the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is  the sacred Home of Islam and the centre towards which Islam throughout  the world turns in prayer. According to the religious injunctions of the  Mussalmans, this entire area should always be under Muslim control, its  scientific border being believed to be a protection for the integrity of  Islamic life and faith. Every Mussalman throughout the world is enjoined  to sacrifice his all, if necessary, for preserving the Jazirat-ul-Arab  under complete Muslim control.    The sacred places of Islam should be in the possession of the Khalifa.  They should not merely be free for the entry of the Mussalmans of the  world by the grace or the license of non-Muslim powers, but should be  the possession and property of Islam in the fullest degree.    It is a religions obligation, on every Mussalman to go forth and help  the Khalifa in every possible way where his unaided efforts in the  defence of the Khilifat have failed.    The grievance of the Indian Mussalmans is that a government that  pretends to protect and spread peace and happiness among them has no  right to ignore or set aside these articles of their cherished faith.    According to the Peace Treaty imposed on the nominal Government at  Constantinople, the Khalifa far from having the temporal authority or  power needed to protect Islam, is a prisoner in his own city. He is to  have no real fighting force, army or navy, and the financial control  over his own territories is vested in other Governments. His capital is  cut off from the rest of his possessions by an intervening permanent  military occupation. It is needless to say that under these conditions  he is absolutely incapable of protecting Islam as the Mussulmans of the  world understand it.    The Jazirat-ul-Arab is split up; a great part of it given to powerful  non-Muslim Powers, the remnant left with petty chiefs dominated all  round by non-Muslim Governments.    The Holy places of Islam are all taken out of the Khalifa's kingdom,  some left in the possession of minor Muslim chiefs of Arabia entirely  dependent on European control, and some relegated to newly-formed  non-Muslim states.    In a word, the Mussalman's free choice of a Khalifa such as Islamic  tradition defines is made an unreality.      THE HINDU DHARMA    The age of misunderstanding and mutual warfare among religions is gone.  If India has a mission of its own to the world, it is to establish the  unity and the truth of all religions. This unity is established by  mutual help and understanding between the various religions. It has come  as a rare privilege to the Hindus in the fulfilment of this mission of  India to stand up in defence of Islam against the onslaught of the  earth-greed of the military powers of the west.    The Dharma of Hinduism in this respect is placed beyond all doubt by the  Bhagavat Gita.    Those who are the votaries of other Gods and worship them with  faith--even they, O Kaunteya, worship me alone, though not as the  Shastra requires--IX, 23.    Whoever being devoted wishes in perfect faith to worship a particular  form, of such a one I maintain the same faith unshaken,--VII 21.    Hinduism will realise its fullest beauty when in the fulfilment of this  cardinal tenet, its followers offer themselves as sacrifice for the  protection of the faith of their brothers, the Mussalmans.

MY MOTHER.      A wigwam of weather-stained canvas stood at the base of some irregularly  ascending hills. A footpath wound its way gently down the sloping land  till it reached the broad river bottom; creeping through the long swamp  grasses that bent over it on either side, it came out on the edge of the  Missouri.    Here, morning, noon, and evening, my mother came to draw water from the  muddy stream for our household use. Always, when my mother started for  the river, I stopped my play to run along with her. She was only of  medium height. Often she was sad and silent, at which times her full  arched lips were compressed into hard and bitter lines, and shadows fell  under her black eyes. Then I clung to her hand and begged to know what  made the tears fall.    \"Hush; my little daughter must never talk about my tears\"; and smiling  through them, she patted my head and said, \"Now let me see how fast you  can run today.\" Whereupon I tore away at my highest possible speed, with  my long black hair blowing in the breeze.    I was a wild little girl of seven. Loosely clad in a slip of brown  buckskin, and light-footed with a pair of soft moccasins on my feet, I  was as free as the wind that blew my hair, and no less spirited than a  bounding deer. These were my mother's pride,--my wild freedom and  overflowing spirits. She taught me no fear save that of intruding myself  upon others.    Having gone many paces ahead I stopped, panting for breath, and laughing  with glee as my mother watched my every movement. I was not wholly  conscious of myself, but was more keenly alive to the fire within. It  was as if I were the activity, and my hands and feet were only  experiments for my spirit to work upon.    Returning from the river, I tugged beside my mother, with my hand upon  the bucket I believed I was carrying. One time, on such a return, I  remember a bit of conversation we had. My grown-up cousin, Warca-Ziwin  (Sunflower), who was then seventeen, always went to the river alone for  water for her mother. Their wigwam was not far from ours; and I saw her  daily going to and from the river. I admired my cousin greatly. So I  said: \"Mother, when I am tall as my cousin Warca-Ziwin, you shall not  have to come for water. I will do it for you.\"    With a strange tremor in her voice which I could not understand, she  answered, \"If the paleface does not take away from us the river we  drink.\"    \"Mother, who is this bad paleface?\" I asked.    \"My little daughter, he is a sham,--a sickly sham! The bronzed Dakota is  the only real man.\"    I looked up into my mother's face while she spoke; and seeing her bite  her lips, I knew she was unhappy. This aroused revenge in my small soul.  Stamping my foot on the earth, I cried aloud, \"I hate the paleface that  makes my mother cry!\"    Setting the pail of water on the ground, my mother stooped, and  stretching her left hand out on the level with my eyes, she placed her  other arm about me; she pointed to the hill where my uncle and my only  sister lay buried.    \"There is what the paleface has done! Since then your father too has  been buried in a hill nearer the rising sun. We were once very happy.  But the paleface has stolen our lands and driven us hither. Having  defrauded us of our land, the paleface forced us away.    \"Well, it happened on the day we moved camp that your sister and uncle  were both very sick. Many others were ailing, but there seemed to be no  help. We traveled many days and nights; not in the grand, happy way that  we moved camp when I was a little girl, but we were driven, my child,  driven like a herd of buffalo. With every step, your sister, who was not  as large as you are now, shrieked with the painful jar until she was  hoarse with crying. She grew more and more feverish. Her little hands  and cheeks were burning hot. Her little lips were parched and dry, but  she would not drink the water I gave her. Then I discovered that her  throat was swollen and red. My poor child, how I cried with her because  the Great Spirit had forgotten us!    \"At last, when we reached this western country, on the first weary night  your sister died. And soon your uncle died also, leaving a widow and an  orphan daughter, your cousin Warca-Ziwin. Both your sister and uncle  might have been happy with us today, had it not been for the heartless  paleface.\"    My mother was silent the rest of the way to our wigwam. Though I saw no  tears in her eyes, I knew that was because I was with her. She seldom  wept before me.          II.    THE LEGENDS.      During the summer days my mother built her fire in the shadow of our  wigwam.    In the early morning our simple breakfast was spread upon the grass west  of our tepee. At the farthest point of the shade my mother sat beside  her fire, toasting a savory piece of dried meat. Near her, I sat upon my  feet, eating my dried meat with unleavened bread, and drinking strong  black coffee.    The morning meal was our quiet hour, when we two were entirely alone. At  noon, several who chanced to be passing by stopped to rest, and to share  our luncheon with us, for they were sure of our hospitality.    My uncle, whose death my mother ever lamented, was one of our nation's  bravest warriors. His name was on the lips of old men when talking of  the proud feats of valor; and it was mentioned by younger men, too, in  connection with deeds of gallantry. Old women praised him for his  kindness toward them; young women held him up as an ideal to their  sweethearts. Every one loved him, and my mother worshiped his memory.  Thus it happened that even strangers were sure of welcome in our lodge,  if they but asked a favor in my uncle's name.    Though I heard many strange experiences related by these wayfarers, I  loved best the evening meal, for that was the time old legends were  told. I was always glad when the sun hung low in the west, for then my  mother sent me to invite the neighboring old men and women to eat supper  with us. Running all the way to the wigwams, I halted shyly at the  entrances. Sometimes I stood long moments without saying a word. It was  not any fear that made me so dumb when out upon such a happy errand; nor  was it that I wished to withhold the invitation, for it was all I could  do to observe this very proper silence. But it was a sensing of the  atmosphere, to assure myself that I should not hinder other plans. My  mother used to say to me, as I was almost bounding away for the old  people: \"Wait a moment before you invite any one. If other plans are  being discussed, do not interfere, but go elsewhere.\"    The old folks knew the meaning of my pauses; and often they coaxed my  confidence by asking, \"What do you seek, little granddaughter?\"    \"My mother says you are to come to our tepee this evening,\" I instantly  exploded, and breathed the freer afterwards.    \"Yes, yes, gladly, gladly I shall come!\" each replied. Rising at once  and carrying their blankets across one shoulder, they flocked leisurely  from their various wigwams toward our dwelling.    My mission done, I ran back, skipping and jumping with delight. All out  of breath, I told my mother almost the exact words of the answers to my  invitation. Frequently she asked, \"What were they doing when you entered  their tepee?\" This taught me to remember all I saw at a single glance.  Often I told my mother my impressions without being questioned.    While in the neighboring wigwams sometimes an old Indian woman asked me,  \"What is your mother doing?\" Unless my mother had cautioned me not to  tell, I generally answered her questions without reserve.    At the arrival of our guests I sat close to my mother, and did not  leave her side without first asking her consent. I ate my supper in  quiet, listening patiently to the talk of the old people, wishing all  the time that they would begin the stories I loved best. At last, when I  could not wait any longer, I whispered in my mother's ear, \"Ask them to  tell an Iktomi story, mother.\"    Soothing my impatience, my mother said aloud, \"My little daughter is  anxious to hear your legends.\" By this time all were through eating, and  the evening was fast deepening into twilight.    As each in turn began to tell a legend, I pillowed my head in my  mother's lap; and lying flat upon my back, I watched the stars as they  peeped down upon me, one by one. The increasing interest of the tale  aroused me, and I sat up eagerly listening to every word. The old women  made funny remarks, and laughed so heartily that I could not help  joining them.    The distant howling of a pack of wolves or the hooting of an owl in the  river bottom frightened me, and I nestled into my mother's lap. She  added some dry sticks to the open fire, and the bright flames leaped up  into the faces of the old folks as they sat around in a great circle.    On such an evening, I remember the glare of the fire shone on a tattooed  star upon the brow of the old warrior who was telling a story. I watched  him curiously as he made his unconscious gestures. The blue star upon  his bronzed forehead was a puzzle to me. Looking about, I saw two  parallel lines on the chin of one of the old women. The rest had"]]]
