[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],[0,"The Story of an African Farm (#1)"],[1,"STORY OF AN AFRICAN FARM    by (AKA Ralph Iron) Olive Schreiner          Preface.    I have to thank cordially the public and my critics for the reception  they have given this little book.    Dealing with a subject that is far removed from the round of English  daily life, it of necessity lacks the charm that hangs about the ideal  representation of familiar things, and its reception has therefore been  the more kindly.    A word of explanation is necessary. Two strangers appear on the scene,  and some have fancied that in the second they have again the first, who  returns in a new guise. Why this should be we cannot tell; unless there  is a feeling that a man should not appear upon the scene, and then  disappear, leaving behind him no more substantial trace than a mere  book; that he should return later on as husband or lover, to fill some  more important part than that of the mere stimulator of thought.    Human life may be painted according to two methods. There is the stage  method. According to that each character is duly marshalled at first,  and ticketed; we know with an immutable certainty that at the right  crises each one will reappear and act his part, and, when the curtain  falls, all will stand before it bowing. There is a sense of satisfaction  in this, and of completeness. But there is another method--the method of  the life we all lead. Here nothing can be prophesied. There is a strange  coming and going of feet. Men appear, act and re-act upon each other,  and pass away. When the crisis comes the man who would fit it does not  return. When the curtain falls no one is ready. When the footlights are  brightest they are blown out; and what the name of the play is no one  knows. If there sits a spectator who knows, he sits so high that the  players in the gaslight cannot hear his breathing. Life may be painted  according to either method; but the methods are different. The canons of  criticism that bear upon the one cut cruelly upon the other.    It has been suggested by a kind critic that he would better have liked  the little book if it had been a history of wild adventure; of cattle  driven into inaccessible kranzes by Bushmen; \"of encounters with  ravening lions, and hair-breadth escapes.\" This could not be. Such works  are best written in Piccadilly or in the Strand: there the gifts of the  creative imagination, untrammelled by contact with any fact, may spread  their wings.    But, should one sit down to paint the scenes among which he has grown,  he will find that the facts creep in upon him. Those brilliant phases  and shapes which the imagination sees in far-off lands are not for him  to portray. Sadly he must squeeze the colour from his brush, and dip it  into the gray pigments around him. He must paint what lies before him.    R. Iron.         \"We must see the first images which the external world casts       upon the dark mirror of his mind; or must hear the first       words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand       by his earliest efforts, if we would understand the       prejudices, the habits, and the passions that will rule his       life.  The entire man is, so to speak, to be found in the       cradle of the child.\"         Alexis de Tocqueville.          Glossary.

The full African moon poured down its light from the blue sky into the  wide, lonely plain. The dry, sandy earth, with its coating of stunted  karoo bushes a few inches high, the low hills that skirted the plain,  the milk-bushes with their long finger-like leaves, all were touched by  a weird and an almost oppressive beauty as they lay in the white light.    In one spot only was the solemn monotony of the plain broken. Near the  centre a small solitary kopje rose. Alone it lay there, a heap of round  ironstones piled one upon another, as over some giant's grave. Here and  there a few tufts of grass or small succulent plants had sprung up among  its stones, and on the very summit a clump of prickly-pears lifted their  thorny arms, and reflected, as from mirrors, the moonlight on their  broad fleshy leaves. At the foot of the kopje lay the homestead.  First, the stone-walled sheep kraals and Kaffer huts; beyond them the  dwelling-house--a square, red-brick building with thatched roof. Even on  its bare red walls, and the wooden ladder that led up to the loft, the  moonlight cast a kind of dreamy beauty, and quite etherealized the low  brick wall that ran before the house, and which inclosed a bare patch of  sand and two straggling sunflowers. On the zinc roof of the great open  wagon-house, on the roofs of the outbuildings that jutted from its side,  the moonlight glinted with a quite peculiar brightness, till it seemed  that every rib in the metal was of burnished silver.    Sleep ruled everywhere, and the homestead was not less quiet than the  solitary plain.    In the farmhouse, on her great wooden bedstead, Tant Sannie, the  Boer-woman, rolled heavily in her sleep.    She had gone to bed, as she always did, in her clothes, and the night  was warm and the room close, and she dreamed bad dreams. Not of the  ghosts and devils that so haunted her waking thoughts; not of her second  husband the consumptive Englishman, whose grave lay away beyond the  ostrich-camps, nor of her first, the young Boer; but only of the sheep's  trotters she had eaten for supper that night. She dreamed that one stuck  fast in her throat, and she rolled her huge form from side to side, and  snorted horribly.    In the next room, where the maid had forgotten to close the shutter, the  white moonlight fell in in a flood, and made it light as day. There were  two small beds against the wall. In one lay a yellow-haired child, with  a low forehead and a face of freckles; but the loving moonlight hid  defects here as elsewhere, and showed only the innocent face of a child  in its first sweet sleep.    The figure in the companion bed belonged of right to the moonlight, for  it was of quite elfin-like beauty. The child had dropped her cover  on the floor, and the moonlight looked in at the naked little limbs.  Presently she opened her eyes and looked at the moonlight that was  bathing her.    \"Em!\" she called to the sleeper in the other bed; but received no  answer. Then she drew the cover from the floor, turned her pillow, and  pulling the sheet over her head, went to sleep again.    Only in one of the outbuildings that jutted from the wagon-house there  was some one who was not asleep.    The room was dark; door and shutter were closed; not a ray of light  entered anywhere. The German overseer, to whom the room belonged, lay  sleeping soundly on his bed in the corner, his great arms folded, and  his bushy grey and black beard rising and falling on his breast. But one  in the room was not asleep. Two large eyes looked about in the darkness,  and two small hands were smoothing the patchwork quilt. The boy, who  slept on a box under the window, had just awakened from his first sleep.  He drew the quilt up to his chin, so that little peered above it but a  great head of silky black"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],[0,"The Children's Six Minutes (#1)"],[1,"CHILDREN'S SIX MINUTES    BRUCE S.

II    PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          TO    HARRIET  ELIZABETH  AND  ROBERT          INTRODUCTION      For many years it has been my custom to give, every Sunday morning, a  brief sermon to the boys and girls of my congregation. This sermon is  never more than six minutes, often only three. As a result there has  been a growing attendance of young people at our morning worship. They  are thus made to feel that they are wanted, and have a part in the  Church which all too often is looked upon as a Church solely for the  grownups. No part of my ministry has given me greater delight and  satisfaction than the thought that I am helping to establish in the  lives of many boys and girls that habit so indispensable to a steady  Christian experience, namely--the habit of Sunday morning worship.    The Memory Texts and Memory Hymns, from the Methodist Episcopal Hymnal,  suggested with each sermon are given for the reason that girls and boys  gladly do memory work if it is definitely assigned them.

The morning of the first day of every year we enter into a contest. We  see who will be the first to give that day's greeting. Before I was  awake this morning my boy ran into my room shouting, \"Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!\" He won in the contest.    Now, however, you are in Church and it is not proper for you to speak  out loud, so I am able to get ahead of you. A Happy New Year to you,  every one.    Well, what will make this year a happy year for you? I will tell you.  Let us take this word Happy, and instead of writing it across the page  let us write it straight up and down.    H stands for Helpful. You cannot have a happy year unless you are  helpful. He who does not try to be helpful is never very happy.    A for Active. I want your year to be full of activity. I hope you will  be able to skate and slide down hill many days this winter, and that  you will enter into all the spring and summer sports with zest and joy.    P for Playful. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You will want  to do something other than play, of course. You will have some home  responsibilities, but sandwiched in with the work may there be a good  measure of play.    P for Purposeful. Yes, early hi life you should form a purpose. Two  questions will help you gain that purpose. 1st--What is it that I want  to do? 2nd--What is it that God wants me to do?    Y for Youth.        Helpful      Active      Playful      Purposeful      Youth.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 19: 14        \"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be      acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.\"    MEMORY HYMN, [572]        _\"Break, newborn year, on glad eyes break.\"_          GROWTH      This second Sunday morning of the New Year I desire to talk to you about  growth. The most important holiday afterthought is the thought of  growth. You are going to grow every day of this year. Whenever I see a  boy on his way to school, or on the field or gymnasium floor, running,  romping, playing, I say to myself, \"Can it be possible that this  restless, energetic lad was ever a quiet, helpless little babe in the  cradle!\" Yes, he was, but he has grown, and he is going to keep right on  growing.    It was said of the boy Jesus, \"He grew.\" His growth was natural. There  was nothing of precociousness in the childhood of Jesus. He grew, just  as every boy grows.        \"A simple-hearted child was he,      And he was nothing more;      In summer days, like you and me,      He played about the door,      Or gathered, where the father toiled,      The shavings from the floor.\"    His growth continued. It did not stop with childhood, but right on  through boyhood, youth and manhood he kept growing. Best of all his  growth was balanced. He grew physically, mentally and spiritually. He  had a sound body. He loved the out-of-doors. He companionshiped much  with nature. Most of his graphic illustrations were taken from living,  growing things. He talked, almost chiefly, about seeds, grain, harvests,  trees, birds and living waters. Boys and girls, strive to grow. Be like  your Master who grew inward, outward, and upward; selfward, manward, and  Godward. \"How can I grow?\" you ask. I will tell you by passing on to you  the secret as given by Maltbie Babcock.        Go      Right      On      Working    MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 2: 40        \"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with      wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.\"    MEMORY HYMN [681]        _\"Brightly gleams our banner.\"_          SNOW      \"Goody, goody, it's snowing!\" This is what I heard early yesterday  morning. I think there were many other homes in which this shout of joy  ushered in the day. It being Saturday the day was mostly free for  playing in the snow. What did you do? You made a snow man. You built a  snow fort or house. You had a snowball battle. You slid down hill. You  played fox and geese, tracking one another across white fields and  through the woods. You had a happy, wonderful day, I know you did.    Have you ever thought how snow is made, and whence it comes? It is  formed high in the air, from vapor, and comes down from the clouds, just  like rain. Snowdrops are like people in one respect, no two are alike.  If you will look at the snowflakes through a magnifying glass you will  see a great variety of shapes. And all of them are beautiful. We talk  about the sparkling beauty of diamonds and other precious gems; crystal  snowflakes are more beautiful by far. If only we could keep them from  melting what a necklace or a setting for a ring a collection of  snowflakes would make!    God's love is shown to us in the snow. For a fall of snow is like a  great blanket, covering the tender roots and seeds, keeping them from  freezing, assuring us of another harvest. As to-day you walk home  through the snow let it speak to you of your Father's love.    MEMORY VERSE, _Job 38: 22_        \"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?\"    MEMORY HYMN [355]        _\"Love divine, all loves excelling.\"_          KINDNESS      One day last week I saw a huge pair of bobs, heavily loaded with coal,  being pulled up the street by two big, fine-looking horses. There were  two men on the load. Their faces were black, but it was the dirt of  honest toil, it was coal dust. They stopped the horses in front of the  house directly across the street from me. I watched them with interest.  The first thing one of the men did was to get down, take a board, go  around to the front of the horses, lift up the heavy wagon tongue, place  the board underneath it as a brace that the necks of the horses might be  relieved of the strain of the wagon tongue. At the same time the other  man took two warm blankets and covered the horses with them, tucking in  the corners beneath the harness to make them tight and warm. Then the  men set to work to carry the coal, basket by basket, into the cellar.  That was kindness, was it not, to see that the horses were so well cared  for on a cold winter day!    To my mind one of the finest acts of our city government is the way we  are taught kindness to dumb animals and birds, by"]]]
