EDITOR'S NOTE    From this volume on, an attempt will be made to bring out, in the  illustrations, certain broad tendencies of German painting in the  nineteenth century, parallel to the literary development here  represented. There will be few direct illustrations of the subject  matter of the text. Instead, each volume will be dominated, as far as  possible, by a master, or a group of masters, whose works offer an  artistic analogy to the character and spirit of the works of literature  contained in it. Volumes IV and V, for instance, being devoted to German  Romantic literature of the early nineteenth century, will present at the  same time selections from the work of two of the foremost Romantic  painters of Germany: Moritz von Schwind and Ludwig Richter. It is hoped  that in this way THE GERMAN CLASSICS OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH  CENTURIES will shed a not unwelcome side-light upon the development of  modern German art.    KUNO FRANCKE.          JEAN PAUL           *       *       *       *       *    THE LIFE OF JEAN PAUL    By BENJAMIN W. WELLS, Ph.D.    Author of _Modern German Literature_.    \"The Spring and I came into the world together,\" Jean Paul liked to  tell his friends when in later days of comfort and fame he looked back  on his early years. He was, in fact, born on the first day (March 21)  and at almost the first hour of the Spring of 1763 at Wunsiedel in the  Fichtelgebirge, the very heart of Germany. The boy was christened  Johann Paul Friedrich Richter. His parents called him Fritz. It was  not till 1793 that, with a thought of Jean Jacques Rousseau, he called  himself Jean Paul.    Place and time are alike significant in his birth. Wunsiedel was a  typical German hill village; the ancestry, as far back as we can trace  it, was typically German, as untouched as Wunsiedel itself, by any  breath of cosmopolitan life. It meant much that the child who was in  later life to interpret most intimately the spirit of the German  people through the days of the French Revolution, of the Napoleonic  tyranny and of the War of Liberation, who was to be a bond between the  old literature and the new, beside, yet independent of, the men of  Weimar, should have such heredity and such environment. Richter's  grandfather had held worthily minor offices in the church, his father  had followed in his churchly steps with especial leaning to music; his  maternal grandfather was a well-to-do clothmaker in the near-by town  of Hof, his mother a long-suffering housewife. It was well that Fritz  brought sunshine with him into the world; for his temperament was his  sole patrimony and for many years his chief dependence. He was the  eldest of seven children. None, save he, passed unscathed through the  privations and trials of the growing household with its accumulating  burdens of debt. For Fritz these trials meant but the tempering of his  wit, the mellowing of his humor, the deepening of his sympathies.    When Fritz was two years old the family moved to Joditz, another  village of the Fichtelgebirge. Of his boyhood here Jean Paul in his  last years set down some mellowed recollections. He tells how his  father, still in his dressing gown, used to take him and his brother  Adam across the Saale to dig potatoes and gather nuts, alternating in  the labor and the play; how his thrifty mother would send him with the  provision bag to her own mother's at Hof, who would give him goodies  that he would share with some little friend. He tells, too, of his  rapture at his first A B C book and its gilded cover, and of his  eagerness at school, until his too-anxious father took him from  contact with the rough peasant boys and tried to educate him himself,  an experience not without value, at least as a warning, to the future  author of _Levana_. But if the Richters were proud, they were very  poor. The boys used to count it a privilege to carry the father's  coffee-cup to him of a Sunday morning, as he sat by the window  meditating his sermon, for then they could carry it back again \"and  pick the unmelted remains of sugar-candy from the bottom of it.\"  Simple pleasures surely, but, as Carlyle says, \"there was a bold,  deep, joyful spirit looking through those young eyes, and to such a  spirit the world has nothing poor, but all is rich and full of  loveliness and wonder.\"    Every book that the boy Fritz could anywise come at was, he tells us,  \"a fresh green spring-place,\" where \"rootlets, thirsty for knowledge  pressed and twisted in every direction to seize and absorb.\" Very  characteristic of the later Jean Paul is one incident of his childhood  which, he says, made him doubt whether he had not been born rather for  philosophy than for imaginative writing. He was witness to the birth  of his own self-consciousness.    [Illustration: JEAN PAUL]    \"One forenoon,\" he writes, \"I was standing, a very young child, by  the house door, looking to the left at the wood-pile, when, all at  once, like a lightning flash from heaven, the inner vision arose  before me: I am an _I_. It has remained ever since radiant. At that  moment my _I_ saw itself for the first time and forever.\"    It is curious to contrast this childhood, in the almost cloistered  seclusion of the Fichtelgebirge, with Goethe's at cosmopolitan  Frankfurt or even with Schiller's at Marbach. Much that came unsought,  even to Schiller, Richter had a struggle to come by; much he could  never get at all. The place of \"Frau Aja\" in the development of the  child Goethe's fancy was taken at Joditz by the cow-girl. Eagerness to  learn Fritz showed in pathetic fulness, but the most diligent search  has revealed no trace in these years of that creative imagination with  which he was so richly dowered.    When Fritz was thirteen his father received a long-hoped-for promotion  to Schwarzenbach, a market town near Hof, then counting some 1,500  inhabitants. The boy's horizon was thus widened, though the family  fortunes were far from finding the expected relief. Here Fritz first  participated in the Communion and has left a remarkable record of his  emotional experience at \"becoming a citizen in the city of God.\" About  the same time, as was to be expected, came the boy's earliest strong  emotional attachment. Katharina Baerin's first kiss was, for him, \"a  unique pearl of a minute, such as never had been and never was to be.\"  But, as with the Communion, though the memory remained, the feeling  soon passed away.    The father designed Fritz, evidently the most gifted of his sons, for  the church, and after some desultory attempts at instruction in  Schwarzenbach, sent him in 1779 to the high school at Hof. His  entrance examination was brilliant, a last consolation to the father,  who died, worn out with the anxieties of accumulating debt, a few  weeks later. From his fellow pupils the country lad suffered much till  his courage and endurance had compelled respect. His teachers were  conscientious but not competent. In the liberally minded Pastor Vogel  of near-by Rehau, however, he found a kindred spirit and a helpful  friend. In this clergyman's generously opened library the thirsty  student made his first acquaintance with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12063"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *        ST. DUNSTAN'S, FLEET STREET.    [Illustration]      No church in London is perhaps better known than the above, which is  distinctively called Saint Dunstan's in the West. External elegance has  little to do with this celebrity, which has been acquired by the two wooden  figures placed on a pediment in front, representing savages, who indicate  the hours and quarters by striking a bell with their clubs: this has caused  a wag to describe them as the most striking wonders of the metropolis.  Another, who is equally disposed to sport with their notoriety, says, \"as  they are visible in the street, they are more admired by many of the  populace on Sundays, than the most elegant preacher from the pulpit  within.\" We are, however, induced to hope better; especially as Dr. Donne,  the celebrated Richard Baxter, and the pious Romaine were preachers at St.  Dunstan's.    There is no evidence when this church was erected; but Stow records burials  in it so early as the year 1421. The date of the above view is 1739, and  from a foot-note to the Engraving, we learn that the church was dedicated  to St. Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury, who died A.D. 990. \"It was  anciently a Rectory, in the patronage of the Convent of Westminster.  Richard de Barking, the abbot, in 1237, granted the advowson to King Henry  III., which continued in the crown till 1362; it was afterwards in the gift  of the bishop of London, till 1386; when Robert de Braybrooke, the bishop,  granted it to the abbot and Convent of Premonastratenses of Alnwick in  Northumberland, where the patronage remained till their suppression. King  Edward VI. granted it to the Lord Dudley, but both the Rectory and Advowson  of the Vicarage were afterwards granted to Sir Richard Sackville, till  alienated to George Rivers, in 1625; it is now in the gift of Joseph  Taylor, Esq.\" (to whom the Plate is dedicated).    St. Dunstan's luckily escaped the fire of London in 1666, which stopped  within three houses of it, as did also another fire, in 1730. The clock and  figures were put up in 1761, and an accurate description of them (quoted  from Smith's _London_ by our esteemed correspondent, P. T. W.) will be  found at page 148, vol. xi. of the MIRROR. The church was thoroughly  repaired, and the roof considerably raised in 1701. The last repairs, which  were considerable, were executed in the year 1820; but it is expected that  the whole building will be shortly taken down, and a new church erected, so  as to widen the public thoroughfare.    Our Engraving is an interesting view of the church nearly a century since,  when a range of shops (since removed) extended beneath the whole of this  side of the structure; and the respective signs must have been unholy  appendages to what appeared like part and parcel of a house of prayer. The  clock is accurately represented, the bracket being a carved figure of Time  with expanded wings, as mention by Smith. The clockmaker proposed to the  parish \"to do one thing, which London shall not show the like,\" and we hope  our Engraving may be the means of rescuing his eccentric ingenuity from  oblivion.           *       *       *       *       *      A DESULTORY CHAPTER ON LOCALITIES.    (_For the Mirror._)        Rotterdam and Erasmus.--Holyrood and Mary Queen of      Scots.--Scotland.--Switzerland and Rousseau.--Pope's      Grotto.--Chiswick, &c.      There is perhaps no sentiment more generally felt, or more delightful, than  that indescribable interest with which we are led to contemplate places and  scenes, immortalized in historical renown, or hallowed by genius.    The propensity for moving from place to place, so observable in mankind,  derives, no doubt, its chief zest from the anxiety we feel to visit  countries of which in the course of our historical researches, we have  heard and read so much to awaken our interest, and excite our admiration.    Without the early reverence which we as boys imbibe for the departed  splendour of Greece and Rome, we should not as men be found wandering among  the ruins of the Pyraeus, or the deserted streets of Pompeii. We find it  impossible to behold unmoved the sad, the astonishing changes which time,  the arch-destroyer has effected with his giant arm. Our exuberant fancies  carry us back to those remote periods when all was glory and magnificence,  where now ruin and desolation have established their melancholy empire.  Abandoning ourselves to the potent influence of classical contemplations of  the past, we revel in the full indulgence of antiquarian enthusiasm.  Imagination, however, needs not in general so wide a field for the exercise  of her magic powers. We desire perhaps more of pleasurable excitement from  the recollections attached to spots identified in our minds with events of  individual or ideal interest, than from the loftier train of thoughts  produced by a pilgrimage to countries which have become famous in ancient  or modern story. Thus we experience more delight in visiting places,  remarkable as having once been the resort or habitations of distinguished  men, than in viewing the ruins of an ancient citadel, or the site of a  celebrated battle. The events achieved on the latter may indeed, in their  time, have turned the scale of empires; but the association of ideas in the  former instances, speak a thousand times more feeling to our individual  sympathies. I remember when passing a couple of days in the opulent city of  Rotterdam, that after walking all the morning along its crowded streets,  and paying the accustomed stranger's tribute of admiration to its quays,  its port, and its commercial magnificence, I at length halted before the  statue of Erasmus. It stands on a pedestal in the middle of a large market,  and represents the celebrated scholar, clothed in his professor's gown, and  seemingly gazing with dignified unconcern at the busy multitude around. I  remained looking at the effigy before me, with a reverential feeling akin  to that of the devotee at the shrine of a patron saint. Imagination  transported me back to the eventful times in which Erasmus flourished,  opening to my mind's eye a long vista of historical recollections, till my  absorbed demeanour attracted observation. I found myself exposed to that  vacant stare with which people are so apt to disconcert your composure, if  they observe you contemplating with curiosity and interest, objects which  they have seen every day of their lives, and for that very reason always  pass unnoticed. Leaving then my position, yet anxious to follow up the  train of ideas it had inspired, I sought, and by dint of inquiry,  discovered the habitation of Erasmus. It is in a dirty street, and consists  of one moderately sized, low roofed apartment, on the first floor of an old  fashioned, ill-built house, which the vicissitudes of time have converted  into an _Estaminet_.[1] I was conducted up a dark, narrow staircase into  the close, dingy room, by an ugly, ignorant frau, who seemed to wonder what  earthly inducement I had to visit her dwelling-house. Lumber and  moth-eaten furniture were carelessly scattered around. A solitary window,  partly blocked up by an old mattress, barely admitted light sufficient to  make objects visible. All was neglect and desolation. It seemed almost  impossible that so obscure and dismal a lodging could have been occupied by  so illustrious a tenant. I fancied I beheld the most learned man of his  age, the counsellor and companion of princes, and the contemporary and  rival of Sir Thomas More, indulging his classical reveries in this  comfortless chamber, regardless of its forlorn and squalid aspect. The  charm was omnipotent. Seated in an ancient leathern-bottomed chair, my  hostess, and the dust and darkness of the place were overlooked or  forgotten. The spirit of the mighty dead seemed to hover around, as a sort  of _genius loci_, rescuing the wretched tenement from otherwise deserved  oblivion, and making its very dinginess venerable!        [1] A low resort, something between a French cafe, and an English          pot-house.    On another occasion I recollect experiencing very strikingly, the force of  local impressions. It was when visiting the apartments of Mary Queen of  Scots, in the palace of Holyrood. Recalling to mind, with the enthusiasm of  one of her warmest admirers, every circumstance connected with the eventful  history of that unfortunate princess, it was impossible for me not to feel  penetrated with the deepest interest. I traversed the very rooms in which  she had sat, and conversed, and passed her hours of peaceful privacy. My  fancy pictured that privacy rudely and brutally invaded by Darnley and his  ruffian associates, when bent on the murder of the ill-fated Rizzio. I  mentally compared the circumstances of that deed of blood, as related by  historians, with the facilities for committing it, afforded by the  distribution of apartments. They tallied exactly. There was the little room  in which sat the queen with her ladies and the devoted secretary. Close to  the door appeared the dark, narrow, turret staircase, which Darnley  ascended before he rushed into Mary's presence. The struggle must have been  desperate, for the murder was not effected in that chamber, Rizzio being  either dragged, or escaped into an adjoining and very obscure anteroom in  which the crime was perpetrated. They pretend to show you marks of his  blood yet visible on the floor. Although all such horrible vestiges have  been most probably long since obliterated, it is yet just possible that  some may remain. To believe so, at the moment, was a lawful indulgence of  my previous illusion. I could have followed the train of associations thus  created much further, had not the person appointed to act "]]]
