At twenty-four he was an M.D. and a distinguished  diagnostician, though he preferred work in his laboratory in his  endeavor to resolve the elements into simpler forms; also he published  at this time a work on anthropology whose circulation was limited to two  hundred copies, and he received in return two hundred letters of  congratulation from great men who had tried to read his book; at  twenty-seven he collapsed one fine spring day on the floor of his  laboratory. That afternoon he was carried into the presence of a great  physician who was also a very vulgar man. The great physician felt his  pulse and looked into his dim eyes.    \"You have a hundred and twenty horsepower brain and a runabout body,\"  said the great physician.    \"I have come,\" answered Randall Byrne faintly, \"for the solution of a  problem, not for the statement thereof.\"    \"I'm not through,\" said the great physician. \"Among other things you are  a damned fool.\"    Randall Byrne here rubbed his eyes.    \"What steps do you suggest that I consider?\" he queried.    The great physician spat noisily.    \"Marry a farmer's daughter,\" he said brutally.    \"But,\" said Randall Byrne vaguely.    \"I am a busy man and you've wasted ten minutes of my time,\" said the  great physician, turning back to his plate glass window. \"My secretary  will send you a bill for one thousand dollars. Good-day.\"    And therefore, ten days later, Randall Byrne sat in his room in the  hotel at Elkhead.    He had just written (to his friend Swinnerton Loughburne, M.A., Ph.D.,  L.L.D.): \"Incontrovertibly the introduction of the personal equation  leads to lamentable inversions, and the perceptive faculties when  contemplating phenomena through the lens of ego too often conceive an  accidental connotation or manifest distortion to be actuality, for the  physical (or personal) too often beclouds that power of inner vision  which so unerringly penetrates to the inherent truths of incorporeity  and the extramundane. Yet this problem, to your eyes, I fear, not  essentially novel or peculiarly involute, holds for my contemplative  faculties an extraordinary fascination, to wit: wherein does the mind,  in itself a muscle, escape from the laws of the physical, and wherein  and wherefore do the laws of the physical exercise so inexorable a  jurisdiction over the processes of the mind, so that a disorder of the  visual nerve actually distorts the asomatous and veils the  pneumatoscopic?    \"Your pardon, dear Loughburne, for these lapses from the general to the  particular, but in a lighter moment of idleness, I pray you give some  careless thought to a problem now painfully my own, though rooted  inevitably so deeply in the dirt of the commonplace.    \"But you have asked me in letter of recent date for the particular  physical aspects of my present environment, and though (as you so well  know) it is my conviction that the physical fact is not and only the  immaterial is, yet I shall gladly look about me--a thing I have not yet  seen occasion to do--and describe to you the details of my present  condition.\"    Accordingly, at this point Randall Byrne removed from his nose his thick  glasses and holding them poised he stared through the window at the view  without. He had quite changed his appearance by removing the spectacles,  for the owlish touch was gone and he seemed at a stroke ten years  younger. It was such a face as one is glad to examine in detail, lean,  pale, the transparent skin stretched tightly over cheekbones, nose, and  chin. That chin was built on good fighting lines, though somewhat  over-delicate in substance and the mouth quite colourless, but oddly  enough the upper lip had that habitual appearance of stiff compression  which is characteristic of highly strung temperaments; it is a  noticeable feature of nearly every great actor, for instance. The nose  was straight and very thin and in a strong sidelight a tracery of the  red blood showed through at the nostrils. The eyes were deeply buried  and the lower lids bruised with purple--weak eyes that blinked at a  change of light or a sudden thought--distant eyes which missed the  design of wall paper and saw the trees growing on the mountains. The  forehead was Byrne's most noticeable feature, pyramidal, swelling  largely towards the top and divided in the centre into two distinct  lobes by a single marked furrow which gave his expression a hint of the  wistful. Looking at that forehead one was strangely conscious of the  brain beneath. There seemed no bony structure; the mind, undefended,  was growing and pushing the confining walls further out.    And the fragility which the head suggested the body confirmed, for he  was not framed to labor. The burden of the noble head had bowed the  slender throat and crooked the shoulders, and when he moved his arm it  seemed the arm of a skeleton too loosely clad. There was a differing  connotation in the hands, to be sure. They were thin--bones and sinews  chiefly, with the violet of the veins showing along the backs; but they  were active hands without tremor--hands ideal for the accurate scalpel,  where a fractional error means death to the helpless.    After a moment of staring through the window the scholar wrote again:  \"The major portion of Elkhead lies within plain sight of my window. I  see a general merchandise store, twenty-seven buildings of a  comparatively major and eleven of a minor significance, and five  saloons. The streets--\"    The streets, however, were not described at that sitting, for at this  juncture a heavy hand knocked and the door of Randall Byrne's room was  flung open by Hank Dwight, proprietor of Elkhead's saloon--a versatile  man, expert behind the bar or in a blacksmith shop.    \"Doc,\" said Hank Dwight, \"you're wanted.\" Randall Byrne placed his  spectacles more firmly on his nose to consider his host.    \"What--\" he began, but Hank Dwight had already turned on his heel.    \"Her name is Kate Cumberland. A little speed, doc. She's in a hurry.\"    \"If no other physician is available,\" protested Byrne, following slowly  down the stairs, \"I suppose I must see her.\"    \"If they was another within ten miles, d'you s'pose I'd call on you?\"  asked Hank Dwight.    So saying, he led the way out onto the veranda, where the doctor was  aware of a girl in a short riding skirt who stood with one gloved hand  on her hip while the other slapped a quirt idly against her riding  boots.          CHAPTER II    WORDS AND BULLETS      \"Here's a gent that calls himself a doc,\" said Hank Dwight by way of an  introduction. \"If you can use him, Miss Cumberland, fly to it!\"    And he left them alone.    Now the sun lay directly behind Kate Cumberland and in order to look at  her closely the doctor had to shade his weak eyes and pucker his brows;  for from beneath her wide sombrero there rolled a cloud of golden hair  as bright as the sunshine itself--a sad strain upon the visual nerve of  Doctor Randall Byrne. He repeated her name, bowed, and when he  straightened, blinked again. As if she appreciated that strain upon his  eyes she stepped closer, and entered the shadow.    \"Doctor Hardin is not in town,\" she said, \"and I have to bring a  physician out to the ranch at once; my father is critically ill.\"    Randall Byrne rubbed his lean chin.    \"I am not practicing at present,\" he said reluctantly. Then he saw that  she was watching him closely, weighing him with her eyes, and it came to  the mind of Randall Byrne that he was not a large man and might not  incline the scale far from the horizontal.    \"I am hardly equipped--\" began Byrne.    \"You will not need equipment,\" she interrupted. \"His trouble lies in his  nerves and the state of his mind.\"    A slight gleam lighted the eyes of the doctor.    \"Ah,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#1)"],[1,"[Advertisement 1: David Bridge & Co., LTD.]    [Advertisement 2: Chas.

In addition, every    important branch of this wide industry is liberally illustrated,    and the   description, although not severely technical, is    sufficiently so to enable students, or those with no previous    knowledge of the subject, to follow the operations intelligently,    and to become more or less acquainted with the general routine    of jute manufacture. As a matter of fact, the work forms a medium    of study for textile students, and a suitable introduction to the    more detailed literature by the authors on these textile subjects.

INTRODUCTORY    The five main fibres used for ordinary textile purposes are cotton,  flax, jute, silk and wool; in this group jute has been considered in  general as being of the least value, not only in regard to price,  but also in regard to utility. It is only under phenomenal  conditions which arise from a great upheaval such as that which took  place during the world's great war from 1914 onwards that, from a  commercial point of view, the extreme importance of the jute fibre  and its products are fully realized. Millions of sand bags were made  from the year 1914 to the year 1918 solely for military purposes,  while huge quantities of jute cloth were utilized as the covering  material for food stuffs of various kinds, thus liberating the other  textile fibres and cloth for equally important purposes. It is on  record that in one short period of fourteen days, 150,000,000  sand-bags were collected, packed and despatched from Dundee to be  used as protective elements in various ways and seats of conflict.    A glance into the records of the textile industries will reveal the  fact that the jute fibre was practically unknown in these islands a  hundred years ago. Unsuccessful attempts were certainly made to  import the fibre into Great Britain in the latter part of the 18th  century, and it has been used in India for centuries in the making  of cord, twine and coarse fabrics, because the fibre is indigenous  to that country. And since all the manufacturing methods there, for  a considerable time were manual ones, the industry--if such it could  be called--moved along slowly, providing employment only for the  needs of a small section of the community on the Eastern shores.    The first small imports of jute fibre were due to the instigation of  Dr. Roxburgh and the East India Company, but it was only after  repeated requests that any attempt was made to utilize the samples  of jute for practical experiments The fibre was so unlike any of the  existing staples that those interested in textiles were not anxious  to experiment with it, but ultimately they were persuaded to do so;  these persistent requests for trials, and the interest which was  finally aroused, formed the nucleus of the existing important jute  industry.    Apart from the above-mentioned efforts, the introduction of the jute  fibre into Great Britain was delayed until 1822, when the first  small consignment reached Dundee--now the Western home of the jute  industry. This quantity was imported into this country with the  special object of having it treated by mechanical means, much in the  same way as flax fibre was being treated. At this period Dundee was  a comparatively important textile centre in regard to the spinning  and weaving of flax and hemp; it was, in consequence, only natural  that the longer, but otherwise apparently similar and coarser, jute  fibre should be submitted to the machinery in vogue for the  preparation and spinning of flax and hemp. When we say similar, we  mean in general appearance; it is now well-known that there is a  considerable difference between jute fibre and those of hemp and flax,  and hence the modifications in preparation which had ultimately to  be introduced to enable the jute fibre to be successfully treated.  These modifications shall be discussed at a later stage.    It might be stated that while only 368 cwt. of jute fibre was  reported as being shipped from Calcutta to this country in 1828, the  imports gradually increased as time passed on. The yarns which were  made from the fibre were heavier or thicker than those in demand for  the usual types of cloth, and it was desirable that other types of  cloth should be introduced so that these yarns could be utilized.  About the year 1838, representatives of the Dutch Government placed  comparatively large orders with the manufacturers for jute bags to  be used for carrying the crop of coffee beans from their West Indian  possessions. The subsequent rapid growth of the industry, and the  demand for newer types of cloth, are perhaps due more to the above  fortunate experiment than to any other circumstance.    By the year or season 1850-51, the British imports of jute fibre had  increased to over 28,000 tons, and they reached 46,000 tons in the  season 1860-61. Attention meanwhile had been directed to the  possibility of manufacturing jute goods by machinery in India--the  seat of the cultivation and growth of the fibre. At least such a  probability was anticipated, for in the year 1858 a small  consignment of machinery was despatched to Calcutta, and an attempt  made to "]]]
