At the  further end of the wood was another pretty cottage and in it lived her  grandmother.    Everybody loved this little girl, her grandmother perhaps loved her  most of all and gave her a great many pretty things. Once she gave her  a red cloak with a hood which she always wore, so people called her  Little Red Riding Hood.    One morning Little Red Riding Hood's mother said, \"Put on your things  and go to see your grandmother. She has been ill; take along this  basket for her. I have put in it eggs, butter and cake, and other  dainties.\"    It was a bright and sunny morning. Red Riding Hood was so happy that  at first she wanted to dance through the wood. All around her grew  pretty wild flowers which she loved so well and she stopped to pick a  bunch for her grandmother.    Little Red Riding Hood wandered from her path and was stooping to pick  a flower when from behind her a gruff voice said, \"Good morning,  Little Red Riding Hood.\" Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw  a great big wolf, but Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a  wicked beast the wolf was, so she was not afraid.    \"What have you in that basket, Little Red Riding Hood?\"    \"Eggs and butter and cake, Mr. Wolf.\"    \"Where are you going with them, Little Red Riding Hood?\"    \"I am going to my grandmother, who is ill, Mr. Wolf.\"    \"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"    \"Along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at  the end of the wood, Mr. Wolf.\"    Then Mr. Wolf again said \"Good morning\" and set off, and Little Red  Riding Hood again went in search of wild flowers.    At last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the  door of the cottage.    \"Who is there?\" called the grandmother.    \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" said the wicked wolf.    \"Press the latch, open the door, and walk in,\" said the grandmother.    The wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in  bed. He made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet.  Then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the  bedclothes.    In a short while Little Red Riding Hood knocked at the door, and  walked in, saying, \"Good morning, Grandmother, I have brought you  eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers I gathered in  the wood.\" As she came nearer the bed she said, \"What big ears you  have, Grandmother.\"    \"All the better to hear you with, my dear.\"    \"What big eyes you have, Grandmother.\"    \"All the better to see you with, my dear.\"    \"But, Grandmother, what a big nose you have.\"    \"All the better to smell with, my dear.\"    \"But, Grandmother, what a big mouth you have.\"    \"All the better to eat you up with, my dear,\" he said as he sprang at  Little Red Riding Hood.    Just at that moment Little Red Riding Hood's father was passing the  cottage and heard her scream. He rushed in and with his axe chopped  off Mr. Wolf's head.    Everybody was happy that Little Red Riding Hood had escaped the wolf.  Then Little Red Riding Hood's father carried her home and they lived  happily ever after.          THE GOOSE-GIRL      There was once an old Queen who had a very beautiful daughter. The  time came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be  married. The old Queen packed up everything suitable to a royal  outfit.    She also sent a Waiting-woman with her. When the hour of departure  came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the  bridegroom's country.    When they had ridden for a time the Princess became very thirsty, and  said to the Waiting-woman, \"Go down and fetch me some water in my cup  from the stream. I must have something to drink.\"    \"If you are thirsty,\" said the Waiting-woman, \"dismount yourself, lie  down by the water and drink. I don't choose to be your servant.\"    Being very thirsty, the Princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing  water.    Now, when she was about to mount her horse again, the Waiting-woman  said, \"By rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!\"    The poor little Princess was obliged to give way. Then the  Waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal  robes, and to put on her own mean garments. Finally she forced her to  swear that she would not tell a person at the Court what had taken  place. Had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the  spot.    There was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. The Prince  hurried towards them, and lifted the Waiting-woman from her horse,  thinking she was his bride. She was led upstairs, but the real  Princess had to stay below.    The old King looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty  little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about  her companion.    \"I picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. Give  the girl something to do to keep her from idling.\"    The old King said, \"I have a little lad who looks after the geese; she  may help him.\"    The boy was called little Conrad, and the real bride was sent with him  to look after the geese. When they reached the meadow, the Princess  sat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when Conrad saw it he  was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--      \"Blow, blow, little breeze,    And Conrad's hat seize.    Let him join in the chase    While away it is whirled,    Till my tresses are curled    And I rest in my place.\"    Then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away Conrad's hat right over  the fields, and he had to run after it. When he came back her hair was  all put up again.    When they got home Conrad went to the King and said, \"I won't tend the  geese with that maiden again.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the King.    Then Conrad went on to tell the King all that had happened in the  field. The King ordered Conrad to go next day as usual and he followed  into the field and hid behind a bush. He saw it happen just as Conrad  had told him. Thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening,  when the Goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these  things.    \"That I may not tell you,\" she answered.    Then he said, \"If you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there;\"  and he went away.    She crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. The King  stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. Then  he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her  beauty was a marvel. Then he called his son and told him that he had a  false bride, but that the true bride was here.    The Prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was  prepared. The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the  Princess on one side and the Waiting-woman at the other; but she did  not recognize the Princess.    When they had eaten, the King put a riddle to the Waiting-woman. \"What  does a person deserve that deceives his master?\" telling the whole  story.    The false bride answered, \"He must be put into a barrel and dragged  along by two white horses till he is dead.\"    \"That is your doom,\" said the King, \"and the judgment shall be carried  out.\"    When the sentence was fulfilled, the young Prince married his true  bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.          BABES IN THE WOOD      Once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were  ill unto death. They begged their brother to care for the two little  ones as he would his own.    The uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to  scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the  children. He sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the  two babes into the woods and kill them.    After going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, \"Let us  not kill the little children, they never harmed us.\" The other robber  would not consent, so they came to blows. This frightened the children  so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.    They wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at  length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their  hearts would break. The little birds heard them and began to trill  sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.    The birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so  they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. They  then told the angels in Heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and  one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the  little ones back to Heaven, so that when they awoke they were no  longer tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.          THE SLEEPING BEAUTY      Once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time  had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them  they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they  invited a number of fairies. But, unfortunately, they left out one  rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the  princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking  her hand with a spindle.    All the other fairies present, except one, had already given the  princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not  prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be  that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#1)"],[1,"THE WORLD OF ICE    OR    The Whaling Cruise of \"The Dolphin\"    AND    The Adventures of Her Crew in the Polar Regions    By    Robert Michael Ballantyne    Author of \"The Dog Crusoe and his Master,\" \"The Young Fur-Traders,\"  \"The Gorilla-Hunters,\" \"Ungava,\" \"The Coral Island,\" &c.    1893              PREFACE      Dear Reader, most people prefer a short to a long preface.

No weasel  was ever half so sensitive on that point as he was. Wherever he happened  to be (and in the course of his adventurous life he had been to nearly  all parts of the known world) he was the first awake in the morning and  the last asleep at night; he always answered promptly to the first call;  and was never known by any man living to have been seen with his eyes  shut, except when he winked, and that operation he performed less  frequently than other men.    John Buzzby was an old salt--a regular true-blue Jack tar of the old  school, who had been born and bred at sea; had visited foreign ports  innumerable; had weathered more storms than he could count, and had  witnessed more strange sights than he could remember. He was tough, and  sturdy, and grizzled, and broad, and square, and massive--a first-rate  specimen of a John Bull, and according to himself, \"always kept his  weather-eye open.\" This remark of his was apt to create confusion in the  minds of his hearers; for John meant the expression to be understood  figuratively, while, in point of fact, he almost always kept one of his  literal eyes open and the other partially closed, but as he reversed the  order of arrangement frequently, he might have been said to keep his  lee-eye as much open as the weather one. This peculiarity gave to his  countenance an expression of earnest thoughtfulness mingled with humour.  Buzzby was fond of being thought old, and he looked much older than he  really was. Men guessed his age at fifty-five, but they were ten years  out in their reckoning; for John had numbered only forty-five summers,  and was as tough and muscular as ever he had been--although not quite so  elastic.    John Buzzby stood on the pier of the sea-port town of Grayton watching  the active operations of the crew of a whaling-ship which was on the  point of starting for the ice-bound seas of the Frozen Regions, and  making sundry remarks to a stout, fair-haired boy of fifteen, who stood  by his side gazing at the ship with an expression of deep sadness.    \"She's a trim-built craft and a good sea-boat, I'll be bound, Master  Fred,\" observed the sailor; \"but she's too small by half, accordin' to  my notions, and I _have_ seen a few whalers in my day. Them bow-timbers,  too, are scarce thick enough for goin' bump agin the ice o' Davis'  Straits. Howsom'iver, I've seen worse craft drivin' a good trade in the  Polar Seas.\"    \"She's a first-rate craft in all respects; and you have too high an  opinion of your own judgment,\" replied the youth indignantly. \"Do you  suppose that my father, who is an older man than yourself and as good a  sailor, would buy a ship, and fit her out, and go off to the  whale-fishery in her, if he did not think her a good one?\"    \"Ah! Master Fred, you're a chip of the old block--neck or nothing--carry  on all sail till you tear the masts out of her! Reef the t'gallant sails  of your temper, boy, and don't run foul of an old man who has been all  but a wet-nurse to ye--taught ye to walk, and swim, and pull an oar, and  build ships, and has hauled ye out o' the sea when ye fell in--from the  time ye could barely stump along on two legs, lookin' like as if ye was  more nor half-seas-over.\"    \"Well, Buzzby,\" replied the boy, laughing, \"if you've been all that to  me, I think you _have_ been a _wet_-nurse too! But why do you run down  my father's ship? Do you think I'm going to stand that? No! not even  from you, old boy.\"    \"Hallo! youngster,\" shouted a voice from the deck of the vessel in  question, \"run up and tell your father we're all ready, and if he don't  make haste he'll lose the tide, so he will, and that'll make us have to  start on a Friday, it will, an' that'll not do for me, nohow it won't;  so make sail and look sharp about it, do--won't you?\"    \"What a tongue he's got!\" remarked Buzzby. \"Before I'd go to sea with a  first mate who jawed like that I'd be a landsman. Don't ever you git to  talk too much, Master Fred, wotever ye do. My maxim is--and it has  served me through life, uncommon--'Keep your weather-eye open and your  tongue housed 'xcept when you've got occasion to use it.' If that  fellow'd use his eyes more and his tongue less, he'd see your father  comin' down the road there, right before the wind, with his old sister  in tow.\"    \"How I wish he would have let me go with him!\" muttered Fred to himself  sorrowfully.    \"No chance now, I'm afeard,\" remarked his companion. \"The gov'nor's as  stiff as a nor'-wester. Nothin' in the world can turn him once he's made  up his mind but a regular sou'-easter. Now, if you had been _my_ son,  and yonder tight craft _my_ ship, I would have said, 'Come at once.' But  your father knows best, lad; and you're a wise son to obey orders  cheerfully, without question. That's another o' my maxims, 'Obey orders,  an' ax no questions.'\"    Frederick Ellice, senior, who now approached, whispering words of  consolation into the ear "]]]
