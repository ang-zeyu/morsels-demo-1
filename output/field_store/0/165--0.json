I have added an Introduction containing an  account of the authoress based on the scanty information available, and I  have compiled some notes illustrating questions connected with Islam  and Musalman usages. I have not thought it necessary to give detailed  references in the notes, but a list of the works which have been used will  be found at the end of the text. As in other volumes of this series, the  diacritical marks indicating the varieties of the sound of certain letters  in the Arabic and Devanagari alphabets have not been given: they are  unnecessary for the scholar and serve only to embarrass the general reader.    I have to acknowledge help from several friends in the preparation of this  edition. Mr. W. Foster, C.I.E., has supplied valuable notes from the India  Office records on Mir Hasan 'Ali and his family; Dr. W. Hoey, late  I.C.S., and Mr. L.N. Jopling, I.C.S., Deputy-Commissioner, Lucknow, have  made inquiries on the same subject. Mr. H.C. Irwin, late I.C.S., has  furnished much information on Oudh affairs in the time of the Nawabi.  Sir C.J. Lyall, K.C.S.I, C.I.E., and Professor E.G. Browne, M.A., have  permitted me to consult them on certain obscure words in the text.    W. CROOKE.        INTRODUCTION      Very little is known about the authoress of this interesting book. She is  reticent about the affairs of her husband and of herself, and inquiries  recently made at Lucknow, at the India Office, and in other likely  quarters in England, have added little to the scanty information we  possess about her.    The family of her husband claimed to be of Sayyid origin, that is to say,  to be descended from the martyrs, Hasan and Husain, the sons of Fatimah,  daughter of the Prophet, by her marriage with her cousin-german, 'Ali.  The father-in-law of the authoress, Mir Haji Shah, of whom she  speaks with affection and respect, was the son of the Qazi, or  Muhammadan law-officer, of Ludhiana, in the Panjab. During his  boyhood the Panjab was exposed to raids by the Mahrattas and incursions of  the Sikhs. He therefore abandoned his studies, wandered about for a time,  and finally took service with a certain Raja--where she does not tell  us--who was then raising a force in expectation of an attack by the Sikhs.  He served in at least one campaign, and then, while still a young man,  made a pilgrimage thrice to Mecca and Kerbela, which gained him the title  of Haji, or pilgrim. While he was in Arabia he fell short of funds,  but he succeeded in curing the wife of a rich merchant who had long  suffered from a serious disease. She provided him with money to continue  his journey. He married under romantic circumstances an Arab girl named  Fatimah as his second wife, and then went to Lucknow, which, under the  rule of the Nawabs, was the centre in Northern India of the Shi'ah  sect, to which he belonged. Here he had an exciting adventure with a tiger  during a hunting party, at which the Nawab, Shuja-ud-daula, was  present. He is believed to have held the post of Peshnamaz, or 'leader  in prayer', in the household of the eunuch, Almas 'Ali Khan, who  is referred to by the authoress.    His son was Mir Hasan 'Ali, the husband of the authoress. The  tradition in Lucknow is that he quarrelled with his father and went to  Calcutta, where he taught Arabic to some British officers and gained a  knowledge of English. We next hear of him in England, when in May 1810 he  was appointed assistant to the well-known oriental scholar, John  Shakespear, professor of Hindustani at the Military College, Addiscombe,  from 1807 to 1830, author of a dictionary of Hindustani and other  educational works. Mention is made of two cadets boarding with Mir  Hasan 'Ali, but it does not appear from the records where he lived.  After remaining at the College for six years he resigned his appointment  on the ground of ill-health, with the intention of returning to India. He  must have been an efficient teacher, because, on his resignation, the East  India Company treated him with liberality. He received a gift of L50 as a  reward for his translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew, and from the  Court minutes it appears that on December 17, 1816, it was resolved to  grant him 100 guineas to provide his passage and L100 for equipment.  Further, the Bengal Government was instructed to furnish him on his  arrival with means to reach his native place, and to pay him a pension of  Rs. 100 _per mensem_ for the rest of his life.[1]    A tradition from Lucknow states that he was sent to England on a secret  mission, 'to ask the Home authorities to accept a contract of Oudh direct  from Nasir-ud-din Haidar, who was quite willing to remit the money  of contract direct to England instead of settling the matter with the  British Resident at Lucknow'. It is not clear what this exactly means. It  may be that the King of Oudh, thinking that annexation was inevitable, may  have been inclined to attempt to secure some private arrangement with the  East India Company, under which he would remain titular sovereign, paying  a tribute direct to the authorities in England, and that he wished to  conduct these negotiations without the knowledge of the Resident at  Lucknow. There does not seem to be independent evidence of this mission of  Mir Hasan 'Ali, and we are told that it was, as might have been  expected, unsuccessful.    No mention is made of his wife in the official records, and I have been  unable to trace her family name or the date and place of her marriage.  Mir Hasan 'Ali and his wife sailed for Calcutta, and travelled to  Lucknow via Patna. She tells little of her career in India, save that she  lived there for twelve years, presumably from 1816 to 1828, and that  eleven years of that time were spent in the house of her father-in-law at  Lucknow. In the course of her book she gives only one date, September 18,  1825, when her husband held the post of Tahsildar, or sub-collector  of revenue, at Kanauj in the British district of Farrukhabad. No  records bearing on his career as a British official are forthcoming.  Another Lucknow tradition states that on his arrival at the Court of Oudh  from England he was, on the recommendation of the Resident, appointed to a  post in the King's service on a salary of Rs. 300 per annum. Subsequently  he fell into disgrace and was obliged to retire to Farrukhabad with  the court eunuch, Nawab Mu'tamad-ud-daula, Agha Mir.    With the restoration of Agha Mir to power, Hasan 'Ali returned  to Lucknow, and was granted a life pension of Rs. 100 _per mensem_ for his  services as Darogha at the Residency, and in consideration of his  negotiations between the King and the British Government or the East India  Company.    From the information collected at Lucknow it appears that he was known as  Mir Londoni, 'the London gentleman', and that he was appointed  Safir, or Attache, at the court of King Ghazi-ud-din Haidar,  who conferred upon him the title of Maslaha-ud-daula, 'Counsellor of  State'. By another account he held the post of Mir Munshi, head  native clerk or secretary to the British Resident.    One of the most influential personages in the court of Oudh during this  period was that stormy petrel of politics, Nawab Hakim Mehndi. He  had been the right-hand man of the Nawab Sa'adat Ali, and on the  accession of his son Ghazi-ud-din Haidar in 1814 he was dismissed on  the ground that he had incited the King to protest against interference in  Oudh affairs by the Resident, Colonel Baillie. The King at the last moment  became frightened at the prospect of an open rupture with the Resident.  Nawab Hakim Mehndi was deprived of all his public offices and of  much of his property, and he was imprisoned for a time. On his release he  retired into British territory, and in 1824 he was living in magnificent  style at Fatehgarh. In that year Bishop Heber visited Lucknow and received  a courteous letter from the Nawab inviting him to his house at  Fatehgarh. He gave the Bishop an assurance 'that he had an English  housekeeper, who knew perfectly well how to do the honours of his  establishment to gentlemen of her own nation. (She is, in fact, a singular  female, who became the wife of one of the Hindustani professors at  Hertford, now the Hukeem's dewan,[2] and bears, I believe, a very  respectable character.)' The authoress makes no reference to Hakim  Mehndi, nor to the fact that she and her husband were in his employment.    The cause of her final departure from India is stated by W. Knighton in a  highly coloured sketch of court life in the days of King Nasir-ud-daula,  _The Private Life of an Eastern King_, published in 1855. 'Mrs. Meer  Hassan was an English lady who married a Lucknow noble during a visit to  England. She spent twelve years with him in India, and did not allow him  to exercise a Moslem's privilege of a plurality of wives.

From his lives of the most eminent English Poets.      The Poems of Dr. Watts were by my recommendation inserted in the  late Collection; the readers of which are to impute to me whatever  pleasure or weariness they may find in the perusal of Blackmore,  Watts, Pomfret, and Yealden.    ISAAC WATTS was born July 17, 1674, at Southampton, where his  father of the same name, kept a boarding-school for young gentlemen,  though common report makes him a shoe-maker. He appears, from the  narrative of Dr. Gibbons, to have been neither indigent nor  illiterate.    Isaac, the eldest of nine children, was given to books from his  infancy; and began, we are told, to learn Latin when he was four  years old, I suppose at home. He was afterwards taught Latin,  Greek, and Hebrew, by Mr. Pinhorne, a clergyman, master of the  freeschool at Southampton, to whom the gratitude of his scholar  afterwards inscribed a Latin ode.    His proficiency at school was so conspicuous, that a subscription  was proposed for his support at the University; but he declared  his resolution to take his lot with the Dissenters. Such he was,  as every Christian Church would rejoice to have adopted.    He therefore repaired in 1690 to an academy taught by Mr. Rowe,  where he had for his companions and fellow-students Mr. Hughes  the poet, and Dr. Horte, afterwards Archbishop of Tuam. Some Latin  essays, supposed to have been written as exercises at this academy,  shew a degree of knowledge, both philosophical and theological,  such as very few attain by a much longer course of study.    He was, as he hints in his Miscellanies, a maker of verses from  fifteen to fifty, and in his youth he appears to have paid attention  to Latin poetry. His verses to his brother, in the _glyconic_  measure, written when he was seventeen, are remarkably easy and  elegant. Some of his other odes are deformed by the Pindaric folly  then prevailing, and are written with such neglect of all metrical  rules as is without example among the ancients; but his diction,  though perhaps not always exactly pure, has such copiousness and  splendour, as shews that he was but at a very little distance  from excellence.    His method of study was to impress the contents of his books upon  his memory by abridging them, and by interleaving them, to amplify  one system with supplements from another.    With the congregation of his tutor Mr. Rowe, who were, I believe,  independents, he communicated in his nineteenth year.    At the age of twenty he left the academy, and spent two years in  study and devotion at the house of his father, who treated him  with great tenderness; and had the happiness, indulged to few  parents, of living to see his son eminent for literature and  venerable for piety.    He was then entertained by Sir John Hartopp five years, as domestic  tutor to his son: and in that time particularly devoted himself  to the Study of the Holy Scriptures; and being chosen assistant  to Dr. Chauncey, preached the first time on the birth-day that  completed his twenty-fourth year; probably considering that as  the day of a second nativity, by which he entered on a new period  of existence.    In about three years he succeeded Dr. Chauncey; but soon after his  entrance on his charge, he was seized by a dangerous illness, which  sunk him to such weakness, that the congregation thought an assistant  necessary, and appointed Mr. Price. His health then returned  gradually, and he performed his duty, till (1712) he was seized  by a fever of such violence and continuance, that from the feebleness  which it brought upon him, he never perfectly recovered.    This calamitous state made the compassion of his friends necessary,  and drew upon him the attention of Sir Thomas Abney, who received  him into his house; where with a constancy of friendship and  uniformity of conduct not often to be found, he was treated for  thirty-six years with all the kindness that friendship could  prompt, and all the attention that respect could dictate. Sir  Thomas died about eight years afterwards; but he continued with  the lady and her daughters to the end of his life. The lady died  about a year after him.    A coalition like this, a state in which the notions of patronage  And dependence were overpowered by the perception of reciprocal  benefits, deserves a particular memorial; and I will not withhold  from the reader Dr. Gibbons's representation, to which regard is  to be paid as to the narrative of one who writes what he knows,  and what is known likewise to multitudes besides.    \"Our next observation shall be made upon that remarkably kind  providence which brought the doctor into Sir Thomas Abney's family,  and continued him there till his death, a period of no less than  thirty-six years. In the midst of his sacred labours for the glory  of God, and good of his generation he is seized with a most violent  and threatening fever, which leaves him oppressed with great  weakness, and puts a stop at least to his public services for four  years. In this distressing season, doubly so to his active and  pious spirit, he is invited to Sir Thomas Abney's family, nor ever  removes from it till he had finished his days. Here he enjoyed the  uninterrupted demonstrations of the truest friendship. Here, without  any care of his own, he had everything which could contribute to  the enjoyment of life, and favour the unwearied pursuits of his  studies. Here he dwelt in a family, which, for piety, order,  harmony, and every virtue, was an house of God. Here he had the  privilege of a country recess, the fragrant bower, the spreading  lawn, the flowery garden, and other advantages to sooth his mind  and aid his restoration to health; to yield him, whenever he chose  them, most grateful intervals from his laborious studies, and  enable him to return to them with redoubled vigour and delight.  Had it not been for this most happy event, he might as to outward  view, have feebly, it may be painfully, dragged on through many  more years of languor and inability for public service, and even  for profitable study, or perhaps might have sunk into his grave  under the overwhelming load of infirmities, in the midst of his  days; and thus the church and world would have been deprived of  those many excellent sermons and works which he drew up and  published during his long residence in this family. In a few years  after his coming hither, Sir Thomas Abney dies; but his amiable  consort survives, who shows the Doctor the same respect and  friendship as before, and most happily for him and great numbers  besides; for, as her riches were great her generosity and munificence  were in full proportion; her thread of life was drawn out to a  great age, even beyond that of the Doctor's; and thus this excellent  man, through her kindness, and that of her daughter, the present  Mrs. Elizabeth Abney, who in a like degree esteemed and honoured  him, enjoyed all the benefits and felicities he experienced at  his first entrance into this family, till his days were numbered  and finished, and, like a shock of corn in its season, he ascended  into the regions of perfect and immortal life and joy.\"    If this quotation has appeared long, let it be considered, that  it comprises an account of six-and-thirty years, and those the  years of Dr. Watts.    From the time of his reception into this family, his life was no  Otherwise diversified than by successive publications. The series  of his works I am not able to deduce; their number, and their  variety, show the intenseness of his industry, and the extent of  his capacity.    He was one of the first authors that taught the Dissenters to  court attention by the graces of language. Whatever they had among  them before, whether of learning or acuteness, was commonly obscured  and blunted by coarseness and inelegance of style. He shewed them,  that zeal and purity might be expressed and enforced by polished  diction.    He continued to the end of his life the teacher of a congregation,  and no reader of his works can doubt his fidelity or diligence. In  the pulpit, though his low stature, which very little exceeded five  feet, graced him with no advantages of appearance, yet the gravity  and propriety of his utterance made his discourses very efficacious.  I once mentioned the reputation which Mr. Foster had gained by his  proper delivery to my friend Dr. Hawkesworth, who told me, that  in the art of pronunciation he was far inferior to Dr. Watts.    Such was his flow of thoughts, and such his promptitude of language,  that in the latter part of his life he did not precompose his  cursory sermons; but having adjusted the heads, and sketched  out some particulars, trusted for success to his extemporary powers.    He did not endeavour to assist his eloquence by any gesticulations;  for, as no corporeal actions have any correspondence with theological  truth, he did not see how they could enforce it."]]]
