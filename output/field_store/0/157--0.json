CHAPTER I. FIRE.    THERE are many of the forces of Nature which tend to injure Books; but  among them all not one has been half so destructive as Fire. It would  be tedious to write out a bare list only of the numerous libraries and  bibliographical treasures which, in one way or another, have been  seized by the Fire-king as his own. Chance conflagrations, fanatic  incendiarism, judicial bonfires, and even household stoves have, time  after time, thinned the treasures as well as the rubbish of past ages,  until, probably, not one thousandth part of the books that have been are  still extant. This destruction cannot, however, be reckoned as all loss;  for had not the \"cleansing fires\" removed mountains of rubbish from our  midst, strong destructive measures would have become a necessity from  sheer want of space in which to store so many volumes.    Before the invention of Printing, books were comparatively scarce; and,  knowing as we do, how very difficult it is, even after the steam-press  has been working for half a century, to make a collection of half a  million books, we are forced to receive with great incredulity the  accounts in old writers of the wonderful extent of ancient libraries.    The historian Gibbon, very incredulous in many things, accepts without  questioning the fables told upon this subject. No doubt the libraries  of MSS. collected generation after generation by the Egyptian Ptolemies  became, in the course of time, the most extensive ever then known;  and were famous throughout the world for the costliness of their  ornamentation, and importance of their untold contents. Two of these  were at Alexandria, the larger of which was in the quarter called  Bruchium. These volumes, like all manuscripts of those early ages, were  written on sheets of parchment, having a wooden roller at each end  so that the reader needed only to unroll a portion at a time. During  Caesar's Alexandrian War, B.C. 48, the larger collection was consumed  by fire and again burnt by the Saracens in A.D. 640. An immense loss was  inflicted upon mankind thereby; but when we are told of 700,000, or even  500,000 of such volumes being destroyed we instinctively feel that such  numbers must be a great exaggeration. Equally incredulous must we be  when we read of half a million volumes being burnt at Carthage some  centuries later, and other similar accounts.    Among the earliest records of the wholesale destruction of Books is that  narrated by St. Luke, when, after the preaching of Paul, many of the  Ephesians \"which used curious arts brought their books together, and  burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and  found it 50,000 pieces of silver\" (Acts xix, 19). Doubtless these books  of idolatrous divination and alchemy, of enchantments and witchcraft,  were righteously destroyed by those to whom they had been and might  again be spiritually injurious; and doubtless had they escaped the fire  then, not one of them would have survived to the present time, no MS. of  that age being now extant. Nevertheless, I must confess to a certain  amount of mental disquietude and uneasiness when I think of books worth  50,000 denarii--or, speaking roughly, say L18,750,[1] of our modern  money being made into bonfires. What curious illustrations of early  heathenism, of Devil worship, of Serpent worship, of Sun worship, and  other archaic forms of religion; of early astrological and chemical  lore, derived from the Egyptians, the Persians, the Greeks; what  abundance of superstitious observances and what is now termed  \"Folklore\"; what riches, too, for the philological student, did those  many books contain, and how famous would the library now be that could  boast of possessing but a few of them.      [1] The received opinion is that the \"pieces of silver\" here mentioned  were Roman denarii, which were the silver pieces then commonly used in  Ephesus. If now we weigh a denarius against modern silver, it is exactly  equal to ninepence, and fifty thousand times ninepence gives L1,875.  It is always a difficult matter to arrive at a just estimate of the  relative value of the same coin in different ages; but reckoning that  money then had at least ten times the purchasing value of money now, we  arrive at what was probably about the value of the magical books burnt,  viz.: L18,750.    The ruins of Ephesus bear unimpeachable evidence that the City was very  extensive and had magnificent buildings. It was one of the free cities,  governing itself. Its trade in shrines and idols was very extensive,  being spread through all known lands. There the magical arts were  remarkably prevalent, and notwithstanding the numerous converts made by  the early Christians, the <gr 'Efesia grammata>, or little scrolls upon  which magic sentences were written, formed an extensive trade up to  the fourth century. These \"writings\" were used for divination, as a  protection against the \"evil eye,\" and generally as charms against all  evil. They were carried about the person, so that probably thousands of  them were thrown into the flames by St. Paul's hearers when his glowing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#1)"],[1,"ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE    By    VACHEL LINDSAY                Intended, First of All, for the New Art Museums Springing Up All over the  Country.

THE PROPHET-WIZARD    XXI.   THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD          A WORD FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DENVER ART ASSOCIATION    The Art of the Moving Picture, as it appeared six years ago, possessed  among many elements of beauty at least one peculiarity. It viewed art as  a reality, and one of our most familiar and popular realities as an art.  This should have made the book either a revelation or utter Greek to most  of us, and those who read it probably dropped it easily into one or the  other of the two categories.    For myself, long a propagandist for its doctrines in another but related  field, the book came as a great solace. In it I found, not an appeal to  have the art museum used--which would have been an old though welcome  story--not this, but much to my surprise, the art museum actually at  work, one of the very wheels on which our culture rolled forward upon its  hopeful way. I saw among other museums the one whose destinies I was  tenderly guiding, playing in Lindsay's book the part that is played by  the classic myths in Milton, or by the dictionary in the writings of the  rest of us. For once the museum and its contents appeared, not as a  lovely curiosity, but as one of the basic, and in a sense humble  necessities of life. To paraphrase the author's own text, the art museum,  like the furniture in a good movie, was actually \"in motion\"--a character  in the play. On this point of view as on a pivot turns the whole book.    In The Art of the Moving Picture the nature and domain of a new Muse is  defined. She is the first legitimate addition to the family since classic  times. And as it required trained painters of pictures like Fulton and  Morse to visualize the possibility of the steamboat and the telegraph, so  the bold seer who perceived the true nature of this new star in our  nightly heavens, it should here be recorded, acquired much of the vision  of his seeing eye through an early training in art. Vachel Lindsay (as he  himself proudly asserts) was a student at the Institute in Chicago for  four years, spent one more at the League and at Chase's in New York, and  for four more haunted the Metropolitan Museum, lecturing to his fellows  on every art there shown from the Egyptian to that of Arthur B. Davies.    Only such a background as this could have evolved the conception of  \"Architecture, sculpture, and painting in motion\" and given authenticity  to its presentation. The validity of Lindsay's analysis is attested by  Freeburg's helpful characterization, \"Composition in fluid forms,\" which  it seems to have suggested. To Lindsay's category one would be tempted to  add, \"pattern in motion,\" applying it to such a film as the \"Caligari\"  which he and I have seen together and discussed during these past few  days. Pattern in this connection would imply an emphasis on the intrinsic  suggestion of the spot and shape apart from their immediate relation to  the appearance of natural objects. But this is a digression. It simply  serves to show the breadth and adaptability of Lindsay's method.    The book was written for a visual-minded public and for those who would  be its leaders. A long, long line of picture-readers trailing from the  dawn of history, stimulated all the masterpieces of pictorial art from  Altamira to Michelangelo. For less than five centuries now Gutenberg has  had them scurrying to learn their A, B, C's, but they are drifting back  to their old ways again, and nightly are forming themselves in cues at  the doorways of the \"Isis,\" the \"Tivoli,\" and the \"Riviera,\" the while  it is sadly noted that \"'the pictures' are driving literature off the  parlor table.\"    With the creative implications of this new pictorial art, with the whole  visual-minded race clamoring for more, what may we not dream in the way  of a new renaissance? How are we to step in to the possession of such a  destiny? Are the institutions with a purely literary theory of life going  to meet the need? Are the art schools and the art museums making  themselves ready to assimilate a new art form? Or what is the type of  institution that will ultimately take the position of leadership in  culture through this new universal instrument?    What possibilities lie in this art, once it is understood and developed,  to plant new conceptions of civic and national idealism? How far may it  go in cultivating concerted emotion in the now ungoverned crowd? Such  questions as these can be answered only by minds with the imagination to  see art as a reality; with faith to visualize for the little mid-western  \"home town\" a new and living Pallas Athena; with courage to raze the very  houses of the city to make new and greater forums and \"civic centres.\"    For ourselves in Denver, we shall try to do justice to the new Muse. In  the museum which we build we shall provide a shrine for her. We shall  first endeavor by those simple means which lie to our hands, to know the  areas of charm and imagination which remain as yet an untilled field of  her domain. Plowing is a simple art, but it requires much sweat. This at  least we know--to the expenditure we cheerfully consent. So much for the  beginning. It would be boastful to describe plans to keep pace with the  enlarging of the motion picture field before a real beginning is made.  But with youth in its favor, the Denver Art Museum hopes yet to see this  art set in its rightful place with painting, sculpture, architecture, and  the handicrafts--hopes yet to be an instrument in the great work of  making this art real as those others are being even now made real, to the  expanding vision of an eager people.        GEORGE WILLIAM EGGERS      Director      The Denver Art Association        DENVER, COLORADO,      New Year's Day, 1922.          BOOK I--THE GENERAL PHOTOPLAY SITUATION IN AMERICA, JANUARY 1, 1922    Especially as Viewed from the Heights of the Civic Centre at Denver,  Colorado, and the Denver Art Museum, Which Is to Be a Leading Feature of  This Civic Centre      In the second chapter of book two, on page 8, the theoretical outline  begins, with a discussion of the Photoplay of Action. I put there on  record the first crude commercial films that in any way establish the  principle. There can never be but one first of anything, and if the  negatives of these films survive the shrinking and the warping that comes  with time, they will still be, in a certain sense, classic, and ten years  hence or two years hence will still be better remembered than any films  of the current releases, which come on like newspapers, and as George Ade  says:--\"Nothing is so dead as yesterday's newspaper.\" But the first  newspapers, and the first imprints of Addison's Spectator, and the first  Almanacs of Benjamin Franklin, and the first broadside ballads and the  like, are ever collected and remembered. And the lists of films given in  books two and three of this work are the only critical and carefully  sorted lists of the early motion pictures that I happen to know anything  about. I hope to be corrected if I am too boastful, but I boast that my  lists must be referred to by all those who desire to study these  experiments in their beginnings. So I let them remain, as still vivid in  the memory of all true lovers of the photoplay who have watched its  growth, fascinated from the first. But I would add to the list of Action  Films of chapter two the recent popular example, Douglas Fairbanks in The  Three Musketeers. That is perhaps the most literal \"Chase-Picture\" that  was ever really successful in the commercial world. The story is cut"]]]
