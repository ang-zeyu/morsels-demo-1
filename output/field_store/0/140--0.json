ZANGWILL    Author of \"The Master,\" \"The King of Schnorrers\" \"Dreamers of the  Ghetto,\" \"Without Prejudice,\" etc.    1914              Preface to the Third Edition.      The issue of a one-volume edition gives me the opportunity of thanking  the public and the critics for their kindly reception of this chart of a  _terra incognita_, and of restoring the original sub-title, which is a  reply to some criticisms upon its artistic form. The book is intended as  a study, through typical figures, of a race whose persistence is the  most remarkable fact in the history of the world, the faith and morals  of which it has so largely moulded. At the request of numerous readers I  have reluctantly added a glossary of 'Yiddish' words and phrases, based  on one supplied to the American edition by another hand. I have omitted  only those words which occur but once and are then explained in the  text; and to each word I have added an indication of the language from  which it was drawn. This may please those who share Mr. Andrew Lang's  and Miss Rosa Dartle's desire for information. It will be seen that most  of these despised words are pure Hebrew; a language which never died off  the lips of men, and which is the medium in which books are written all  the world over even unto this day.

Not here in our London Ghetto the gates and gaberdines of the olden       Ghetto of the Eternal City; yet no lack of signs external by which       one may know it, and those who dwell therein. Its narrow streets       have no specialty of architecture; its dirt is not picturesque. It       is no longer the stage for the high-buskined tragedy of massacre       and martyrdom; only for the obscurer, deeper tragedy that evolves       from the pressure of its own inward forces, and the long-drawn-out       tragi-comedy of sordid and shifty poverty. Natheless, this London       Ghetto of ours is a region where, amid uncleanness and squalor, the       rose of romance blows yet a little longer in the raw air of English       reality; a world which hides beneath its stony and unlovely surface       an inner world of dreams, fantastic and poetic as the mirage of the       Orient where they were woven, of superstitions grotesque as the       cathedral gargoyles of the Dark Ages in which they had birth. And       over all lie tenderly some streaks of celestial light shining from       the face of the great Lawgiver.         The folk who compose our pictures are children of the Ghetto; their       faults are bred of its hovering miasma of persecution, their       virtues straitened and intensified by the narrowness of its       horizon. And they who have won their way beyond its boundaries must       still play their parts in tragedies and comedies--tragedies of       spiritual struggle, comedies of material ambition--which are the       aftermath of its centuries of dominance, the sequel of that long       cruel night in Jewry which coincides with the Christian Era. If       they are not the Children, they are at least the Grandchildren of       the Ghetto.    The particular Ghetto that is the dark background upon which our  pictures will be cast, is of voluntary formation.    People who have been living in a Ghetto for a couple of centuries, are  not able to step outside merely because the gates are thrown down, nor  to efface the brands on their souls by putting off the yellow badges.  The isolation imposed from without will have come to seem the law of  their being. But a minority will pass, by units, into the larger, freer,  stranger life amid the execrations of an ever-dwindling majority. For  better or for worse, or for both, the Ghetto will be gradually  abandoned, till at last it becomes only a swarming place for the poor  and the ignorant, huddling together for social warmth. Such people are  their own Ghetto gates; when they migrate they carry them across the sea  to lands where they are not. Into the heart of East London there poured  from Russia, from Poland, from Germany, from Holland, streams of Jewish  exiles, refugees, settlers, few as well-to-do as the Jew of the proverb,  but all rich in their cheerfulness, their industry, and their  cleverness. The majority bore with them nothing but their phylacteries  and praying shawls, and a good-natured contempt for Christians and  Christianity. For the Jew has rarely been embittered by persecution. He  knows that he is in _Goluth_, in exile, and that the days of the Messiah  are not yet, and he looks upon the persecutor merely as the stupid  instrument of an all-wise Providence. So that these poor Jews were rich  in all the virtues, devout yet tolerant, and strong in their reliance on  Faith, Hope, and more especially Charity.    In the early days of the nineteenth century, all Israel were brethren.  Even the pioneer colony of wealthy Sephardim--descendants of the Spanish  crypto-Jews who had reached England _via_ Holland--had modified its  boycott of the poor Ashkenazic immigrants, now they were become an  overwhelming majority. There was a superior stratum of Anglo-German Jews  who had had time to get on, but all the Ashkenazic tribes lived very  much like a happy family, the poor not stand-offish towards the rich,  but anxious to afford them opportunities for well-doing. The _Schnorrer_  felt no false shame in his begging. He knew it was the rich man's duty  to give him unleavened bread at Passover, and coals in the winter, and  odd half-crowns at all seasons; and he regarded himself as the Jacob's  ladder by which the rich man mounted to Paradise. But, like all genuine  philanthropists, he did not look for gratitude. He felt that virtue was  its own reward, especially when he sat in Sabbath vesture at the head of  his table on Friday nights, and thanked God in an operatic aria for the  white cotton table-cloth and the fried sprats. He sought personal  interviews with the most majestic magnates, and had humorous repartees  for their lumbering censure.    As for the rich, they gave charity unscrupulously--in the same Oriental,  unscientific, informal spirit in which the _Dayanim_, those cadis of the  East End, administered justice. The _Takif_, or man of substance, was as  accustomed to the palm of the mendicant outside the Great Synagogue as  to the rattling pyx within. They lived in Bury Street, and Prescott  Street, and Finsbury--these aristocrats of the Ghetto--in mansions that  are now but congeries of \"apartments.\" Few relations had they with  Belgravia, but many with Petticoat Lane and the Great _Shool_, the  stately old synagogue which has always been illuminated by candles and  still refuses all modern light. The Spanish Jews had a more ancient  _snoga_, but it was within a stone's throw of the \"Duke's Place\"  edifice. Decorum was not a feature of synagogue worship in those days,  nor was the Almighty yet conceived as the holder of formal receptions  once a week. Worshippers did not pray with bated breath, as if afraid  that the deity would overhear them. They were at ease in Zion. They  passed the snuff-boxes and remarks about the weather. The opportunities  of skipping afforded by a too exuberant liturgy promoted conversation,  and even stocks were discussed in the terrible _longueurs_ induced by  the meaningless ministerial repetition of prayers already said by the  congregation, or by the official recitations of catalogues of purchased  benedictions. Sometimes, of course, this announcement of the offertory  was interesting, especially when there was sensational competition. The  great people bade in guineas for the privilege of rolling up the Scroll  of the Law or drawing the Curtain of the Ark, or saying a particular  _Kaddish_ if they were mourners, and then thrills of reverence went  round the congregation. The social hierarchy was to some extent  graduated by synagogal contributions, and whoever could afford only a  little offering had it announced as a \"gift\"--a vague term which might  equally be the covering of a reticent munificence.    Very few persons, \"called up\" to the reading of the Law, escaped at the  cost they had intended, for one is easily led on by an insinuative  official incapable of taking low views of the donor's generosity and a  little deaf. The moment prior to the declaration of the amount was quite  exciting for the audience.

PREFACE    THESE Excursions in the Byways of Thought were undertaken at different  times and on different occasions; consequently, the reader may be able  to detect in them inequalities of treatment. He may feel that I have  lingered too long in some byways and hurried too rapidly through others,  taking, as it were, but a general view of the road in the latter case,  whilst examining everything that could be seen in the former with,  perhaps, undue care. As a matter of fact, how ever, all these excursions  have been undertaken with one and the same object in view, that, namely,  of understanding aright and appreciating at their true worth some of the  more curious byways along which human thought has travelled. It is easy  for the superficial thinker to dismiss much of the thought of the past  (and, indeed, of the present) as _mere_ superstition, not worth the  trouble of investigation: but it is not scientific. There is a reason  for every belief, even the most fantastic, and it should be our object  to discover this reason. How far, if at all, the reason in any case  justifies us in holding a similar belief is, of course, another  question. Some of the beliefs I have dealt with I have treated at  greater length than others, because it seems to me that the truths of  which they are the images--vague and distorted in many cases though they  be--are truths which we have either forgotten nowadays, or are in danger  of forgetting. We moderns may, indeed, learn something from the thought  of the past, even in its most fantastic aspects. In one excursion at  least, namely, the essay on \"The Cambridge Platonists,\" I have ventured  to deal with a higher phase--perhaps I should say the highest phase--of  the thought of a bygone age, to which the modern world may be completely  debtor.    \"Some Characteristics of Mediaeval Thought,\" and the two essays on  Alchemy, have appeared in _The Journal of the Alchemical Society_.  In others I have utilised material I have contributed to _The Occult  Review_, to the editor of which journal my thanks are due for permission  so to do.

SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDAEVAL THOUGHT    IN the earliest days of his upward evolution man was satisfied with  a very crude explanation of natural phenomena--that to which the name  \"animism\" has been given. In this stage of mental development all the  various forces of Nature are personified: the rushing torrent, the  devastating fire, the wind rustling the forest leaves--in the mind of  the animistic savage all these are personalities, spirits, like himself,  but animated by motives more or less antagonistic to him.    I suppose that no possible exception could be taken to the statement  that modern science renders animism impossible. But let us inquire  in exactly what sense this is true. It is not true that science robs  natural phenomena of their spiritual significance. The mistake is often  made of supposing that science explains, or endeavours to explain,  phenomena. But that is the business of philosophy. The task science  attempts is the simpler one of the correlation of natural phenomena, and  in this effort leaves the ultimate problems of metaphysics untouched. A  universe, however, whose phenomena are not only capable of some degree  of correlation, but present the extraordinary degree of harmony and  unity which science makes manifest in Nature, cannot be, as in animism,  the product of a vast number of inco-ordinated and antagonistic wills,  but must either be the product of one Will, or not the product of will  at all.    The latter alternative means that the Cosmos is inexplicable, which not  only man's growing experience, but the fact that man and the  universe form essentially a unity, forbid us to believe. The term  \"anthropomorphic\" is too easily applied to philosophical systems, as if  it constituted a criticism of their validity. For if it be true, as  all must admit, that the unknown can only be explained in terms of  the known, then the universe must either be explained in terms of  man--_i.e_. in terms of will or desire--or remain incomprehensible. That  is to say, a philosophy must either be anthropomorphic, or no philosophy  at all.    Thus a metaphysical scrutiny of the results of modern science leads us  to a belief in God. But man felt the need of unity, and crude animism,  though a step in the right direction, failed to satisfy his thought,  long before the days of modern science. The spirits of animism, however,  were not discarded, but were modified, co-ordinated, and worked into a  system as servants of the Most High. Polytheism may mark a stage in this  process; or, perhaps, it was a result of mental degeneracy.    What I may term systematised as distinguished from crude animism  persisted throughout the Middle Ages. The work of systematisation had  already been accomplished, to a large extent, by the Neo-Platonists  and whoever were responsible for the Kabala. It is true that these main  sources of magical or animistic philosophy remained hidden during the  greater part of the Middle Ages; but at about their close the youthful  and enthusiastic CORNELIUS AGRIPPA (1486-1535)(1) slaked his thirst  thereat and produced his own attempt at the systematisation of magical  belief in the famous _Three Books of Occult Philosophy_. But the waters  of magical philosophy reached the mediaeval mind through various devious  channels, traditional on the one hand and literary on the other. And of  the latter, the works of pseudo-DIONYSIUS,(2) whose immense influence  upon mediaeval thought has sometimes been neglected, must certainly be  noted.      (1) The story of his life has been admirably told by HENRY MORLEY (2  vols., 1856).    (2) These writings were first heard of in the early part of the sixth  century, and were probably the work of a Syrian monk of that date, who  fathered them on to DIONYSIUS the Areopagite as a pious fraud. See Dean  INGE'S _Christian Mysticism_ (1899), pp. 104--122, and VAUGHAN'S _Hours  with the Mystics_ (7th ed., 1895), vol. i. pp. 111-124. The books have  been translated into English by the Rev. JOHN PARKER (2 vols.1897-1899),  who believes in the genuineness of their alleged authorship.      The most obvious example of a mediaeval animistic belief is that in  \"elementals\"--the spirits which personify the primordial forces of  Nature, and are symbolised by the four elements, immanent in which they  were supposed to exist, and through which they were held to manifest  their powers. And astrology, it must be remembered, is essentially a  systematised animism. The stars, to the ancients, were not material  bodies like the earth, but spiritual beings. PLATO (427-347 B.C.) speaks  of them as \"gods\". Mediaeval thought did not regard them in quite this  way. But for those who believed in"]]]
