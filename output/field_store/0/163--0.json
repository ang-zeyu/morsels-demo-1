London    1889              [Illustration: ALLAN OCTAVIAN HUME]      [Illustration: ALERE FLAMMAM]        AUTHOR'S PREFACE.      I have long regretted my inability to issue a revised edition of  'Nests and Eggs.' For many years after the first Rough Draft appeared,  I went on laboriously accumulating materials for a re-issue, but  subsequently circumstances prevented my undertaking the work. Now,  fortunately, my friend Mr. Eugene Gates has taken the matter up, and  much as I may personally regret having to hand over to another a task,  the performance of which I should so much have enjoyed, it is some  consolation to feel that the readers, at any rate, of this work will  have no cause for regret, but rather of rejoicing that the work has  passed into younger and stronger hands.    One thing seems necessary to explain. The present Edition does not  include quite all the materials I had accumulated for this work. Many  years ago, during my absence from Simla, a servant broke into my  museum and stole thence several cwts. of manuscript, which he sold  as waste paper. This manuscript included more or less complete  life-histories of some 700 species of birds, and also a certain number  of detailed accounts of nidification. All small notes on slips of  paper were left, but almost every article written on full-sized  foolscap sheets was abstracted. It was not for many months that the  theft was discovered, and then very little of the MSS. could be  recovered.    It thus happens that in the cases of some of the most interesting  species, of which I had worked up all the notes into a connected  whole, nothing, or, as in the case of _Argya subrufa_, only a single  isolated note, appears in the text. It is to be greatly regretted, for  my work was imperfect enough as it was; and this 'Selection from the  Records,' that my Philistine servant saw fit to permit himself, has  rendered it a great deal more imperfect still; but neither Mr. Oates  nor myself can be justly blamed for this.    In conclusion, I have only to say that if this compilation should find  favour in any man's sight he must thank Mr. Oates for it, since not  only has he undergone the labour of arranging my materials and seeing  the whole work through the press--not only has he, I believe, added  himself considerably to those materials--but it is solely owing to him  that the work appears _at all_, as I know no one else to whom I could  have entrusted the arduous and, I fear, thankless duty that he has so  generously undertaken.    ALLAN HUME.    Rothney Castle, Simla,  October 19th, 1889.          EDITOR'S NOTE.      Mr. Hume has sufficiently explained the circumstances under which this  edition of his popular work has been brought about. I have merely to  add that, as I was engaged on a work on the Birds of India, I thought  it would be easier for me than for anyone else to assist Mr. Hume.  I was also in England, and knew that my labour would be very much  lightened by passing the work through the press in this country.  Another reason, perhaps the most important, was the fear that, as Mr.  Hume had given up entirely and absolutely the study of birds, the  valuable material he had taken such pains to accumulate for this  edition might be irretrievably lost or further injured by lapse of  time unless early steps were taken to utilize it.    A few words of explanation appear necessary on the subject of the  arrangement of this edition. Mr. Hume is in no way responsible for  this arrangement nor for the nomenclature employed. He may possibly  disapprove of both. He, however, gave me his manuscript unreservedly,  and left me free to deal with it as I thought best, and I have to  thank him for reposing this confidence in me. Left thus to my own  devices, I have considered it expedient to conform in all respects to  the arrangement of my work on the Birds, which I am writing, side by  side, with this work. The classification I have elaborated for my  purpose is totally different to that employed by Jerdon and familiar  to Indian ornithologists; but a departure from Jerdon's arrangement  was merely a question of time, and no better opportunity than the  present for readjusting the classification of Indian birds appeared  likely to present itself. I have therefore adopted a new system, which  I have fully set forth in my other work.    I take this opportunity to present the readers of Mr. Hume's work with  portraits of Mr. Hume himself, of Mr. Brian Hodgson, the late Dr.  Jerdon, and the late Colonel Tickell.    EUGENE W.

There are in addition a few pictures of  child life.    The selections include a study of the field, the dooryard, and  the home interior, and range from the happiest to the most sombre  subjects.

ON MILLET'S CHARACTER AS AN ARTIST      The distinctive features of Millet's art are so marked that the most  inexperienced observer easily identifies his work. As a painter of  rustic subjects, he is unlike any other artists who have entered the  same field, even those who have taken his own themes. We get at the  heart of the matter when we say that Millet derived his art directly  from nature. \"If I could only do what I like,\" he said, \"I would paint  nothing that was not the result of an impression directly received  from nature, whether in landscape or in figure.\" His pictures are  convincing evidence that he acted upon this theory. They have a  peculiar quality of genuineness beside which all other rustic art  seems forced and artificial.    The human side of life touched him most deeply, and in many of his  earlier pictures, landscape was secondary. Gradually he grew into  the larger conception of a perfect harmony between man and his  environment. Henceforth landscape ceased to be a mere setting or  background in a figure picture, and became an organic part of the  composition. As a critic once wrote of the Shepherdess, \"the earth  and sky, the scene and the actors, all answer one another, all hold  together, belong together.\" The description applies equally well to  many other pictures and particularly to the Angelus, the Sower, and  the Gleaners. In all these, landscape and figure are interdependent,  fitting together in a perfect unity.    As a painter of landscapes, Millet mastered a wide range of the  effects of changing light during different hours of the day. The mists  of early morning in Filling the Water-Bottles; the glare of noonday in  the Gleaners; the sunset glow in the Angelus and the Shepherdess;  the sombre twilight of the Sower; and the glimmering lamplight of  the Woman Sewing, each found perfect interpretation. Though showing  himself capable of representing powerfully the more violent aspects of  nature, he preferred as a rule the normal and quiet.    In figure painting Millet sought neither grace nor beauty, but  expression. That he regarded neither of these first two qualities as  intrinsically unworthy, we may infer from the grace of the Sower, and  the naive beauty of the Shepherdess and the Woman Sewing. But that  expression was of paramount interest to him we see clearly in the  Angelus and the Man with the Hoe. The leading characteristic of his  art is strength, and he distrusted the ordinary elements of prettiness  as taking something from the total effect he wished to produce. \"Let  no one think that they can force me to prettify my types,\" he said. \"I  would rather do nothing than express myself feebly.\"    It was always his first aim to make his people look as if they  belonged to their station. The \"mute inglorious Milton\" and Maud  Muller with her \"nameless longings\" had no place on his canvases. His  was the genuine peasant of field and farm, no imaginary denizen of the  poets' Arcady. \"The beautiful is the fitting,\" was his final summary  of aesthetic theory, and the theory was put into practice on every  canvas.    In point of composition Millet's pictures have great excellence. \"I  try not to have things look as if chance brought them together,\" he  said, \"but as if they had a necessary bond between them.\" So nothing  is accidental, but every object, however small, is an indispensable  part of the whole scheme.    An important characteristic of his work is its power to suggest  the third dimension of space. The figures have a solid, tangible  appearance, as if actually alive. The Gleaners, the Woman Churning,  and the Man with the Hoe are thoroughly convincing in their reality.    The picture of the Gleaners especially has that so-called \"quality of  circumambient light\" which circulates about the objects, so to speak,  and gives them position in space. Millet's landscapes also have  a depth of spaciousness which reaches into infinite distance. The  principles of composition are applied in perspective as well as  laterally. We can look into the picture, through it, and beyond it, as  if we were standing in the presence of nature.    Mr. Bernhard Berenson goes so far as to say that this art of \"space  composition,\" as he terms it, can \"directly communicate religious  emotion,\" and explains on this ground the devotional influence of  Perugino's works, which show so remarkable a feeling for space.[1]  If he is right, it is on this principle, rather than because of its  subject, that the Angelus is, as it has sometimes been called, \"one of  the greatest religious paintings of the age.\"    While Millet's art is, in its entirety, quite unique, there are  certain interesting points of resemblance between his work and that of  some older masters. He is akin to Rembrandt both in his indifference  to beauty and in his intense love of human nature. Millet's  indifference to beauty is the more remarkable because in this he stood  alone in his day and generation, while in the northern art of the  seventeenth century, of which Rembrandt is an exponent, beauty was  never supreme.    As a lover of human nature, Millet's sympathies, though no less  intense than Rembrandt's, were less catholic. His range of observation  was limited to peasant life, while the Dutch master painted all  classes and conditions of men. Yet both alike were profound students  of character and regarded expression as the chief element of beauty.  Rembrandt, however, sought expression principally in the countenance,  and Millet had a fuller understanding of the expressiveness of the  entire body. The work of each thus complements that of the other.    Millet's passion for figure expression was first worked out in  painting the nude. When he abandoned such subjects for the homelier  themes of labor, he gave no less attention to the study of form and  attitude. The simple clothing of the peasant is cut so loosely as to  give entire freedom of motion to the body, and it is worn so long  that it shapes itself perfectly to the figure. The body thus clad  is scarcely inferior to the nude in assuming the fine lines of an  expressive pose.    Millet's instinct for pose was that of a sculptor. Many of the  figures for his pictures were first carefully modelled in wax or clay.  Transferred to canvas they are drawn in the strong simple outlines of  a statue. It is no extravagant flight of fancy which has likened him  to Michelangelo. In the strength and seriousness of his conceptions,  the bold sweep of his lines, and, above all, in the impression of  motion which he conveys, he has much in common with the great Italian  master. Like Michelangelo, Millet gives first preference to the  dramatic moment when action is imminent. The Sower is in the act of  casting the seed into the ground, as David is in the act of stretching  his sling. As we look, we seem to see the hand complete its motion. So  also the Gleaners, the Women Filling the Water-Bottles, and the Potato  Planters are all portrayed in attitudes of performance.    When Millet represents repose it is as an interval of suspended  action, not as the end of completed work. The Shepherdess pauses but  a moment in her walk and will immediately move on again. The man and  woman of the Angelus rest only for the prayer and then resume their  work. The Man with the Hoe snatches but a brief respite from his  labors. The impression of power suggested by his figure, even in  immobility, recalls Michelangelo's Jeremiah.    To the qualities which are reminiscent of Michelangelo Millet adds  another in which he is allied to the Greeks. This is his tendency  towards generalization. It is the typical rather than the individual  which"]]]
