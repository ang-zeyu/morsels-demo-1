But it does not deal, in its present form, with the geology   of the neighbourhood of Chester only.  I have tried so to recast it,   that any townsman, at least in the manufacturing districts of England   and Scotland, may learn from it to judge, roughly perhaps, but on the   whole accurately, of the rocks and soils of his own neighbourhood.    He will find, it is true, in these pages, little or nothing about   those \"Old Red Sandstones,\" so interesting to a Scotchman; and he   will have to bear in mind, if he belong to the coal districts of   Scotland, that the \"stones in the wall\" there belong to much older   rocks than those \"New Red Sandstones\" of which this book treats; and   that the coal measures of Scotland, with the volcanic rocks which   have disturbed them, are often very different in appearance to the   English coal measures.  But he will soon learn to distinguish the   relative age of rocks by the fossils found in them, which he can now,   happily, study in many local museums; and he may be certain, for the   rest, that all rocks and soils whatsoever which he may meet have been   laid down by the agents, and according to the laws, which I have   tried to set forth in this book; and these only require, for the   learning of them, the exercise of his own observation and common   sense.  I have not tried to make this a handbook of geological facts.    Such a guide (and none better) the young man will find in Sir Charles   Lyell's \"Student's Elements of Geology.\"  I have tried rather to   teach the method of geology, than its facts; to furnish the student   with a key to all geology, rough indeed and rudimentary, but sure and   sound enough, I trust, to help him to unlock most geological problems   which he may meet, in any quarter of the globe.  But young men must   remember always, that neither this book, nor all the books in the   world, will make them geologists.  No amount of book learning will   make a man a scientific man; nothing but patient observation, and   quiet and fair thought over what he has observed.  He must go out for   himself, see for himself, compare and judge for himself, in the   field, the quarry, the cutting.  He must study rocks, ores, fossils,   in the nearest museum; and thus store his head, not with words, but   with facts.  He must verify--as far as he can--what he reads in   books, by his own observation; and be slow to believe anything, even   on the highest scientific authority, till he has either seen it, or   something like enough to it to make it seem to him probable, or at   least possible.  So, and so only, will he become a scientific man,   and a good geologist; and acquire that habit of mind by which alone   he can judge fairly and wisely of facts of any kind whatsoever.    I say--facts of any kind whatsoever.  If any of my readers should be   inclined to say to themselves:  Geology may be a very pleasant study,   but I have no special fancy for it.  I had rather learn something of   botany, astronomy, chemistry, or what not--I shall answer:  By all   means.  Learn any branch of Natural Science you will.  It matters   little to me which you learn, provided you learn one at least.  But   bear in mind, and settle it in your hearts, that you will learn no   branch of science soundly, so as to master it, and be able to make   use of it, unless you acquire that habit and method of mind which I   am trying to teach you in this book.  I have tried to teach it you by   geology, because geology is, perhaps, the simplest and the easiest of   all physical sciences.  It appeals more than any to mere common   sense.  It requires fewer difficult experiments, and expensive   apparatus.  It requires less previous knowledge of other sciences,   whether pure or mixed; at least in its rudimentary stages.  It is   more free from long and puzzling Greek and Latin words.  It is   specially, the poor man's science.  But if you do not like it, study   something else.  Only study that as you must study geology;   proceeding from the known to the unknown by observation and   experiment.    But here some of my readers may ask, as they have a perfect right to   ask, why I wish young men to learn Natural Science at all?  What good   will the right understanding of geology, or of astronomy, or of   chemistry, or of the plants or animals which they meet--what good, I   say, will that do them?    In the first place, they need, I presume, occupation after their   hours of work.  If any of them answer:  \"We do not want occupation,   we want amusement.  Work is very dull, and we want something which   will excite our fancy, imagination, sense of humour.  We want poetry,   fiction, even a good laugh or a game of play\"--I shall most fully   agree with them.  There is often no better medicine for a hard-worked   body and mind than a good laugh; and the man who can play most   heartily when he has a chance of playing is generally the man who can   work most heartily when he must work.  But there is certainly nothing   in the study of physical science to interfere with genial hilarity;   though, indeed, some solemn persons have been wont to reprove the   members of the British Association, and specially that Red Lion Club,   where all the philosophers are expected to lash their tails and roar,   of being somewhat too fond of mere and sheer fun, after the abstruse   papers of the day are read and discussed.  And as for harmless   amusement, and still more for the free exercise of the fancy and the   imagination, I know few studies to compare with Natural History; with   the search for the most beautiful and curious productions of Nature   amid her loveliest scenery, and in her freshest atmosphere.  I have   known again and again working men who in the midst of smoky cities   have kept their bodies, their minds, and their hearts healthy and   pure by going out into the country at odd hours, and making   collections of fossils, plants, insects, birds, or some other objects   of natural history; and I doubt not that such will be the case with   some of my readers.    Another argument, and a very strong one, in favour of studying some   branch of Natural Science just now is this--that without it you can   hardly keep pace with the thought of the world around you.    Over and above the solid gain of a scientific habit of mind, of which   I shall speak presently, the gain of mere facts, the increased   knowledge of this planet on which we live, is very valuable just now;   valuable certainly to all who do not wish their children and their   younger brothers to know more about the universe than they do.    Natural Science is now occupying a more and more important place in   education.  Oxford, Cambridge, the London University, the public   schools, one after another, are taking up the subject in earnest; so   are the middle-class schools; so I trust will all primary schools   throughout the country; and I hope that my children, at least, if not   I myself, will see the day, when ignorance of the primary laws and   facts of science will be looked on as a defect, only second to   ignorance of the primary laws of religion and morality.    I speak strongly, but deliberately.  It does seem to me strange, to   use the mildest word, that people whose destiny it is to live, even   for a few short years, on this planet which we call the earth, and   who do not at all intend to live on it as hermits, shutting   themselves up in cells, and looking on death as an escape and a   deliverance, but intend to live as comfortably and wholesomely as   they can, they and their children after them--it seems strange, I   say, that such people should in general be so careless about the   constitution of this same planet, and of the laws and facts on which   depend, not merely their comfort and their wealth, but their health   and their very lives, and the health and the lives of their children   and descendants.    I know some will say, at least to themselves:  \"What need for us to   study science?  There are plenty to do that already; and we shall be   sure sooner or later to profit by their discoveries; and meanwhile it   is not science which is needed to make mankind thrive, but simple   common sense.\"    I should reply, that to expect to profit by other men's discoveries   when you do not pay for them--to let others labour in the hope of   entering into their labours, is not a very noble or generous state of   mind--comparable somewhat, I should say, to that of the fatting ox,   who willingly allows the farmer to house him, till for him, feed him,   provided only he himself may lounge in his stall, and eat, and NOT be   thankful.  There is one difference in the two cases, but only one--  that while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox, the   scientific man cannot repay himself by eating you; and so never gets   paid, in most cases, at all.    But as for mankind thriving by common sense:  they have not thriven   by common sense, because they have not used their common sense   according to that regulated method which is called science.  In no   age, in no country, as yet, have the majority of mankind been guided,   I will not say by the love of God, and by the fear of God, but even   by sense and reason.  Not sense and reason, but nonsense and   unreason, prejudice and fancy, greed and haste, have led them to such   results as were to be expected--to superstitions, persecutions, wars,   famines, pestilence, hereditary diseases, poverty, waste--waste   incalculable, and now too often irremediable--waste of life, of   labour, of capital, of raw material, of soil, of manure, of every   bounty which God has bestowed on man, till, as in the eastern   Mediterranean, whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1027"],[0,"The Lone Star Ranger: A Romance of the Border (#1)"],[1,"LONE STAR RANGER    By Zane Grey                  To            CAPTAIN JOHN HUGHES            and his Texas Rangers      It may seem strange to you that out of all the stories I heard on the  Rio Grande I should choose as first that of Buck Duane--outlaw and  gunman.    But, indeed, Ranger Coffee's story of the last of the Duanes has haunted  me, and I have given full rein to imagination and have retold it in my  own way. It deals with the old law--the old border days--therefore it is  better first. Soon, perchance, I shall have the pleasure of writing of  the border of to-day, which in Joe Sitter's laconic speech, \"Shore is  'most as bad an' wild as ever!\"    In the North and East there is a popular idea that the frontier of the  West is a thing long past, and remembered now only in stories. As I  think of this I remember Ranger Sitter when he made that remark, while  he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound. And I remember the giant  Vaughn, that typical son of stalwart Texas, sitting there quietly with  bandaged head, his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had  ambushed him. Only a few months have passed since then--when I had my  memorable sojourn with you--and yet, in that short time, Russell and  Moore have crossed the Divide, like Rangers.    Gentlemen,--I have the honor to dedicate this book to you, and the  hope that it shall fall to my lot to tell the world the truth about a  strange, unique, and misunderstood body of men--the Texas Rangers--who  made the great Lone Star State habitable, who never know peaceful rest  and sleep, who are passing, who surely will not be forgotten and will  some day come into their own.    ZANE GREY          BOOK I. THE OUTLAW        CHAPTER I    So it was in him, then--an inherited fighting instinct, a driving  intensity to kill. He was the last of the Duanes, that old fighting  stock of Texas. But not the memory of his dead father, nor the pleading  of his soft-voiced mother, nor the warning of this uncle who stood  before him now, had brought to Buck Duane so much realization of  the dark passionate strain in his blood. It was the recurrence, a  hundred-fold increased in power, of a strange emotion that for the last  three years had arisen in him.    \"Yes, Cal Bain's in town, full of bad whisky an' huntin' for you,\"  repeated the elder man, gravely.    \"It's the second time,\" muttered Duane, as if to himself.    \"Son, you can't avoid a meetin'. Leave town till Cal sobers up. He ain't  got it in for you when he's not drinkin'.\"    \"But what's he want me for?\" demanded Duane. \"To insult me again? I  won't stand that twice.\"    \"He's got a fever that's rampant in Texas these days, my boy. He wants  gun-play. If he meets you he'll try to kill you.\"    Here it stirred in Duane again, that bursting gush of blood, like a  wind of flame shaking all his inner being, and subsiding to leave him  strangely chilled.    \"Kill me! What for?\" he asked.    \"Lord knows there ain't any reason. But what's that to do with most of  the shootin' these days? Didn't five cowboys over to Everall's kill  one another dead all because they got to jerkin' at a quirt among  themselves? An' Cal has no reason to love you. His girl was sweet on  you.\"    \"I quit when I found out she was his girl.\"    \"I reckon she ain't quit. But never mind her or reasons. Cal's here,  just drunk enough to be ugly. He's achin' to kill somebody. He's one of  them four-flush gun-fighters. He'd like to be thought bad. There's a lot  of wild cowboys who're ambitious for a reputation. They talk about how  quick they are on the draw. T hey ape Bland an' King Fisher an' Hardin  an' all the big outlaws. They make threats about joinin' the gangs along  the Rio Grande. They laugh at the sheriffs an' brag about how they'd  fix the rangers. Cal's sure not much for you to bother with, if you only  keep out of his way.\"    \"You mean for me to run?\" asked Duane, in scorn.    \"I reckon I wouldn't put it that way. Just avoid him. Buck, I'm not  afraid Cal would get you if you met down there in town. You've your  father's eye an' his slick hand with a gun. What I'm most afraid of is  that you'll kill Bain.\"    Duane was silent, letting his uncle's earnest words sink in, trying to  realize their significance.    \"If Texas ever recovers from that fool war an' kills off these outlaws,  why, a young man will have a lookout,\" went on the uncle. \"You're  twenty-three now, an' a powerful sight of a fine fellow, barrin' your  temper. You've a chance in life. But if you go gun-fightin', if you kill  a man, you're ruined. Then you'll kill another. It'll be the same old  story. An' the rangers would make you an outlaw. The rangers mean law  an' order for Texas. This even-break business doesn't work with them. If  you resist arrest they'll kill you. If you submit to arrest, then you go  to jail, an' mebbe you hang.\"    \"I'd never hang,\" muttered Duane, darkly.    \"I reckon you wouldn't,\" replied the old man. \"You'd be like your  father. He was ever ready to draw--too ready. In times like these, with  the Texas rangers enforcin' the law, your Dad would have been driven to  the river. An', son, I'm afraid you're a chip off the old block. Can't  you hold in--keep your temper--run away from trouble? Because it'll only  result in you gettin' the worst of it in the end. Your father was killed  in a street-fight. An' it was told of him that he shot twice after a  bullet had passed through his heart. Think of the terrible nature of a  man to be able to do that. If you have any such blood in you, never give  it a chance.\"    \"What you say is all very well, uncle,\" returned Duane, \"but the only  way out for me is to run, and I won't do it. Cal Bain and his outfit  have already made me look like a coward. He says I'm afraid to come out  and face him. A man simply can't stand that in this country. Besides,  Cal would shoot me in the back some day if I didn't face him.\"    \"Well, then, what're you goin' to do?\" inquired the elder man.    \"I haven't decided--yet.\"    \"No, but you're comin' to it mighty fast. That damned spell is workin'  in you. You're different to-day. I remember how you used to be moody an'  lose your temper an' talk wild. Never was much afraid of you then. But  now you're gettin' cool an' quiet, an' you think deep, an' I don't like  the light in your eye. It reminds me of your father.\"    \"I wonder what Dad would say to me to-day if he were alive and here,\"  said Duane.    \"What do you think? What could you expect of a man who never wore a  glove on his right hand for twenty years?\"    \"Well, he'd hardly have said much. Dad never talked. But he would have  done a lot. And I guess I'll go down-town and let Cal Bain find me.\"    Then followed a long silence, during which Duane sat with downcast eyes,  and the uncle appeared lost in sad thought of the future. Presently he  turned to Duane with an expression that denoted resignation, and yet a  spirit which showed wherein they were of the same blood.    \"You've got a fast horse--the fastest I know of in this country. After  you meet Bain hurry back home. I'll have a saddle-bag packed for you and  the horse ready.\"    With that he turned on his heel and went into the house, leaving Duane  to revolve in his mind his singular speech. Buck wondered presently if  he shared his uncle's opinion of the result of a meeting between himself  and Bain. His thoughts were vague. But on the instant of final decision,  when he had settled with himself that he would meet Bain, such a storm  of passion assailed him that he felt as if he was being shaken with  ague. Yet it was all internal, inside his breast, for his hand was like  a rock and, for all he could see, not a muscle about him quivered. He  had no fear of Bain or of any other man; but a vague fear of himself, of  this strange force in him, made him ponder and shake his head. It was as  if he had not all to say in this matter. There appeared to have been in  him a reluctance to let himself go, and some voice, some spirit from a  distance, something he was not accountable for, had compelled him.  That hour of Duane's life was like years of actual living, and in it he  became a thoughtful man.    He went into the house and buckled on his belt and gun. The gun was a  Colt.45, six-shot, and heavy, with an ivory handle. He had packed it,  on and off, for five years. Before that it had been used by his father.  There were a number of notches filed in the bulge of the ivory handle.  This gun was the one his father had fired twice after being shot  through the heart, and his hand had stiffened so tightly upon it in  the death-grip that his fingers had to be pried open. It had never been  drawn upon any man since it had come into Duane's possession. But the  cold, bright polish of the weapon showed how it had been used. Duane  could draw it with inconceivable rapidity, and at twenty feet he could  split a card pointing edgewise toward him.    Duane wished to avoid meeting his mother. Fortunately, as he thought,  she was away from home. He went out and down the path toward the gate.  The air was full of the fragrance of blossoms and the melody of birds.  Outside in the road a neighbor woman stood talking to a countryman in a  wagon; they spoke to him; and he heard, but did not reply. Then he began  to stride down the road toward the town.    Wellston was a small town, but important in that unsettled part of the  great state because it was the trading-center of several hundred miles  of territory. On the main street there were perhaps fifty buildings,  some brick, some frame, mostly adobe, and one-third of the lot, and by  far the most prosperous, were saloons. From the road Duane turned into  this street. It was a wide thoroughfare lined by hitching-rails and  saddled horses and vehicles of various kinds. Duane's eye ranged down  the street, taking in all at a glance, particularly persons moving  leisurely up and down. Not a cowboy was in sight."]]]
