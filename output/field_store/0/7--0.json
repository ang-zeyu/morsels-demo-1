ISABELLA BEETON.                            Nothing lovelier can be found    In Woman, than to study household good.--MILTON.          Published Originally By  S. O. Beeton in 24 Monthly Parts  1859-1861.    First Published in a Bound Edition 1861.          PREFACE.    I must frankly own, that if I had known, beforehand, that this book  would have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been  courageous enough to commence it. What moved me, in the first instance,  to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I  had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have  always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family  discontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways. Men  are now so well served out of doors,--at their clubs, well-ordered  taverns, and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the  attractions of these places, a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted  with the theory and practice of cookery, as well as be perfectly  conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable  home.    In this book I have attempted to give, under the chapters devoted to  cookery, an intelligible arrangement to every recipe, a list of the  _ingredients_, a plain statement of the _mode_ of preparing each dish,  and a careful estimate of its _cost_, the _number of people_ for whom it  is _sufficient_, and the time when it is _seasonable_. For the matter of  the recipes, I am indebted, in some measure, to many correspondents of  the \"Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine,\" who have obligingly placed at my  disposal their formulas for many original preparations. A large private  circle has also rendered me considerable service. A diligent study of  the works of the best modern writers on cookery was also necessary to  the faithful fulfilment of my task. Friends in England, Scotland,  Ireland, France, and Germany, have also very materially aided me. I have  paid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of \"COLD  MEAT COOKERY.\" But in the department belonging to the Cook I have  striven, too, to make my work something more than a Cookery Book, and  have, therefore, on the best authority that I could obtain, given an  account of the natural history of the animals and vegetables which we  use as food. I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance  on the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying  him, the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes,  have described the modes of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game. Skilful  artists have designed the numerous drawings which appear in this work,  and which illustrate, better than any description, many important and  interesting items. The coloured plates are a novelty not without value.    Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to  the cook's department, there are chapters devoted to those of the other  servants of the household, who have all, I trust, their duties clearly  assigned to them.    Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the  \"Management of Children\"----\"The Doctor,\" the latter principally  referring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain to  occur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter  contains \"Legal Memoranda,\" which will be serviceable in cases of doubt  as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord  and Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer.    These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to  confidence; those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the  legal matter by a solicitor.    I wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have  received during the progress of this work, and have only further to add,  that I trust the result of the four years' incessant labour which I have  expended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen  and countrywomen.

Clap to the  leaves and go no farther than this, for I tell you plainly that if you  go farther you will be scandalized by seeing good, sober folks of real  history so frisk and caper in gay colors and motley that you would not  know them but for the names tagged to them. Here is a stout, lusty  fellow with a quick temper, yet none so ill for all that, who goes by  the name of Henry II.  Here is a fair, gentle lady before whom all the  others bow and call her Queen Eleanor.  Here is a fat rogue of a fellow,  dressed up in rich robes of a clerical kind, that all the good folk call  my Lord Bishop of Hereford.  Here is a certain fellow with a sour temper  and a grim look--the worshipful, the Sheriff of Nottingham.  And here,  above all, is a great, tall, merry fellow that roams the greenwood and  joins in homely sports, and sits beside the Sheriff at merry feast,  which same beareth the name of the proudest of the Plantagenets--Richard  of the Lion's Heart.  Beside these are a whole host of knights, priests,  nobles, burghers, yeomen, pages, ladies, lasses, landlords, beggars,  peddlers, and what not, all living the merriest of merry lives, and all  bound by nothing but a few odd strands of certain old ballads (snipped  and clipped and tied together again in a score of knots) which draw  these jocund fellows here and there, singing as they go.    Here you will find a hundred dull, sober, jogging places, all tricked  out with flowers and what not, till no one would know them in their  fanciful dress. And here is a country bearing a well-known name, wherein  no chill mists press upon our spirits, and no rain falls but what rolls  off our backs like April showers off the backs of sleek drakes; where  flowers bloom forever and birds are always singing; where every fellow  hath a merry catch as he travels the roads, and ale and beer and wine  (such as muddle no wits) flow like water in a brook.    This country is not Fairyland.  What is it?  'Tis the land of Fancy, and  is of that pleasant kind that, when you tire of it--whisk!--you clap the  leaves of this book together and 'tis gone, and you are ready for  everyday life, with no harm done.    And now I lift the curtain that hangs between here and No-man's-land.  Will you come with me, sweet Reader?  I thank you. Give me your hand.

Also telling how his band gathered around him, and of the  merry adventure that gained him his good right hand man, the famous  Little John.        How Robin Hood Came to Be an Outlaw    IN MERRY ENGLAND in the time of old, when good King Henry the Second  ruled the land, there lived within the green glades of Sherwood Forest,  near Nottingham Town, a famous outlaw whose name was Robin Hood.  No  archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill  and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore  merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades. Right  merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering  neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or  bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King's venison, washed down with  draughts of ale of October brewing.    Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart  from other men, yet they were beloved by the country people round about,  for no one ever came to jolly Robin for help in time of need and went  away again with an empty fist.    And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the  law.    When Robin was a youth of eighteen, stout of sinew and bold of heart,  the Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a  prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in  Nottinghamshire.  \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"will I go too, for fain would I  draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October  brewing.\" So up he got and took his good stout yew bow and a score or  more of broad clothyard arrows, and started off from Locksley Town  through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham.    It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime, when hedgerows are green  and flowers bedeck the meadows; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and  fair primroses all along the briery hedges; when apple buds blossom and  sweet birds sing, the lark at dawn of day, the throstle cock and cuckoo;  when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts; when busy  housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass.  Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths, and bright the  green and rustling leaves, amid which the little birds sang with might  and main: and blithely Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of  Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a youth's thoughts  are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.    As thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle, he came  suddenly upon some foresters seated beneath a great oak tree.  Fifteen  there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as  they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself,  thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate  with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that  stood nigh. Each man was clad in Lincoln green, and a fine show they  made, seated upon the sward beneath that fair, spreading tree. Then one  of them, with his mouth full, called out to Robin, \"Hulloa, where goest  thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy farthing shafts?\"    Then Robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his  green years.    \"Now,\" quoth he, \"my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine; and  moreover, I go to the shooting match at Nottingham Town, which same has  been proclaimed by our good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire; there I will  shoot with other stout yeomen, for a prize has been offered of a fine  butt of ale.\"    Then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said, \"Ho! listen to the  lad! Why, boy, thy mother's milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips, and  yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at Nottingham butts,  thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a two-stone bow.\"    \"I'll hold the best of you twenty marks,\" quoth bold Robin, \"that I hit  the clout at threescore rods, by the good help of Our Lady fair.\"    At this all laughed aloud, and one said, \"Well boasted, thou fair  infant, well boasted!  And well thou knowest that no target is nigh to  make good thy wager.\"    And another cried, \"He will be taking ale with his milk next.\"    At this Robin grew right mad.  \"Hark ye,\" said he, \"yonder, at the  glade's end, I see a herd of deer, even more than threescore rods  distant. I'll hold you twenty marks that, by leave of Our Lady, I cause  the best hart among them to die.\"    \"Now done!\" cried he who had spoken first.  \"And here are twenty marks.  I wager that thou causest no beast to die, with or without the aid of  Our Lady.\"    Then Robin took his good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at his  instep, he strung it right deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard  arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray goose feather to his ear; the  next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a  sparrowhawk skims in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart of  all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the green path with his  heart's blood.    \"Ha!\" cried Robin, \"how likest thou that shot, good fellow? I wot the  wager were mine, an it were three hundred pounds.\"    Then all the foresters were filled with rage, and he who had spoken the  first and had lost the wager was more angry than all.    \"Nay,\" cried he, \"the wager is none of thine, and get thee gone,  straightway, or, by all the saints of heaven, I'll baste thy sides until  thou wilt ne'er be able to walk again.\" \"Knowest thou not,\" said  another, \"that thou hast killed the King's deer, and, by the laws of our  gracious lord and sovereign King Harry, thine ears should be shaven  close to thy head?\"    \"Catch him!\" cried a third.    \"Nay,\" said a fourth, \"let him e'en go because of his tender years.\"    Never a word said Robin Hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim  face; then, turning on his heel, strode away from them down the forest  glade. But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood was hot and  youthful and prone to boil.    Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left  Robin Hood alone; but his anger was hot, both because the youth had  gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he  had been quaffing.  So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to  his feet, and seized upon his bow"]]]
