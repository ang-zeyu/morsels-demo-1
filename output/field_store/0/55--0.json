FEEDING THE MULTITUDES.      Jesus had chosen twelve out of the many who flocked about Him wishing to  be His disciples, and these twelve were called apostles. He sent them  forth to preach the gospel, giving them power to cast out evil spirits  and to heal diseases; and when they were about to go forth upon their  mission, He gave them instructions regarding what they were to do, and  warned them of the persecutions which would be heaped upon them. He also  bade them be strong and not fear those who had power to kill the body  only, because the soul was far more precious. So the apostles went out  into the cities and towns and preached the word of God and carried  blessing with them.    When they came back they told Jesus what they had done, and they went  with Him across the sea of Galilee to a quiet spot where they could rest  and talk over their work.    But the people went around the sea, or lake, to join them on the other  side; and when Jesus saw the crowds He was sorry for them, and taught  and healed them again as He had done so many times.    In the evening His disciples urged Him to send the people away that they  might buy food for themselves in the village; but Jesus said, \"Give ye  them to eat.\"    The disciples thought this would be impossible. \"We have here but five  loaves and two fishes,\" they told Him; and when He said, \"Bring them  hither to Me,\" they obeyed Him with wonder.    Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down in groups upon the green  grass; and He took the loaves and gave thanks to God for them, and broke  them into pieces, handing them to His disciples to give to the people.    He divided the fishes also in the same way, and the disciples went about  among the groups giving each person a share, and everyone had enough to  eat; for although there were about five thousand men there, besides  women and children, the food was sufficient for all. Even more than  this, when the multitude had eaten all that they wanted, the disciples  gathered up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces.    When the people saw this wonderful miracle which Jesus had done, they  wished to make Him king at once, for they thought He was the Promised  One for whom they had been so long waiting, and they did not know that  the kingdom of Christ was not to be an earthly kingdom.    But Jesus would not allow them to make Him king, and He left them and  went up on the top of a mountain alone.    On another occasion when a great crowd had gathered to hear Him and had  been for a long time without food, He called His disciples to Him and  told them that He felt very sorry for the people because they had been  fasting three days, and He could not send them away so weak and hungry  for fear they would faint before they could reach home.    But His disciples said they did not know where they could get food for  so many, as they were in the wilderness.    Jesus asked them how many loaves of bread they had, and they told Him  seven, and also a few small fishes.    Then Jesus bade the people sit down on the ground around Him, and He  took the seven loaves and the fishes and offered thanks to God;  afterwards, He broke the loaves into pieces as He had done before and  gave them, with the fishes, to His disciples, and the disciples  distributed them among the people. As they gave out the food it  continued to increase wonderfully, so that all the people were fed;  and even after that there was food enough left so that they took up  seven baskets full, although about four thousand men, with many women  and children, had eaten.    These miracles show not only the power of our Lord, but His tenderness  and thoughtfulness for those around Him in the everyday affairs of life.  He not only cared for the souls of His people, but for their physical  comfort as well; for His heart was ever open to the cry of human need.    One of the first acts by which He manifested His power to the men who  afterwards became His disciples, was an act of helpfulness.    He saw two ships by the Lake of Gennesaret with the fishermen near by  washing their nets, and going aboard one of the ships, which belonged to  Simon Peter, He asked him to put out a little way from land; then, when  His request had been complied with, He taught the people from the ship.    After He had finished His teaching, He said to Simon, \"Launch out into  the deep and let down your nets for a draught.\" Simon told Him that they  had worked all night and had caught no fish, but that they would do as  He bade them.    And when they had done so, the net was filled so that it broke, and they  had to call to their partners in the other ship to come and help them;  and both ships were filled. Then Peter and James and John left all to  follow Jesus.          JESUS CALMS THE TEMPEST.      At one time when Jesus had entered a ship to cross the Sea of Galilee  with His disciples, a great storm arose and the waves nearly covered the  little vessel, so that they were apparently in great danger.    The disciples were frightened, but Jesus was asleep and the storm did  not disturb Him. As it grew worse and worse and the disciples became  more than ever afraid, they went back to where Jesus lay and wakened  Him, crying out, \"Master, dost Thou not care that we perish?\"    When they said this, Jesus arose and spoke to the winds and the sea,  saying, \"Peace, be still!\" Then at once the wind went down and the sea  became calm, and the hearts of the men were filled with wonder and still  greater faith and awe, while they said to one another, \"What manner of  man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?\" They had not yet  learned that Jesus had power over all things whenever He chose to  exercise it.    At another time when the disciples had crossed the Sea of Galilee,  expecting that Jesus would join them upon the other side, a storm came  up, suddenly as before, and the waters were quickly piled up in great  waves; for the lake was narrow and deep, and the storms usually burst in  full fury with little warning, doing much harm before there was a chance  to escape. At this time the disciples had hard work to row the boat  against the wind, and it was tossed about here and there by the waves in  the middle of the sea until, toward morning, Jesus went out toward it,  walking upon the water.    When the disciples saw Him coming they thought it was a spirit and  were frightened: but He spoke to them, saying, \"Be of good cheer; it is  I, be not afraid.\"    [Illustration: JESUS WALKING UPON THE WATERS.]    Then Peter said: \"Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the  water.\"    Jesus said, \"Come,\" and Peter stepped out upon the water and started  toward the Master; but his faith was not strong enough, and as he began  to sink he cried, \"Lord, save me!\"    Jesus stretched out His hand and held him up. \"O thou of little faith,\"  He said, \"wherefore didst thou doubt?\"    When Jesus came into the boat the storm ceased, and soon they reached  the shore. Then the disciples worshiped Him and said, \"Of a truth Thou  art the Son of God.\"          RUTH AND NAOMI.      The story of Ruth and Naomi is one of the sweetest and most touching of  all the Bible stories. It shows the beauty of unselfish devotion and  constant love, and the happiness which they brought, and teaches a  lesson which is very helpful to us all.    A long time ago, in the days of the judges of Israel, there was a famine  in the land of Canaan, and a man named Elimelech, whose home was in  Bethlehem, went with his wife Naomi and his two sons to live in Moab.    After they had been there a while Naomi's husband died, leaving her with  the two sons. Then, by and by, the sons married, and their wives were  very good to Naomi, and loved her. But it was only ten years before both  of the sons died, and Naomi thought it was best for her to go back to  her old home in Canaan; for she had been told that there was plenty in  the land once more, and she wanted to see her own people and the  relatives of her husband who was dead. So Naomi told her  daughters-in-law to return to their own homes, because she could not  expect them to be willing to leave everything for her sake.    \"Go, each of you, to your mother's house,\" she said; \"the Lord deal  kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me.\" But they  both wept and clung to her, saying, \"Surely we will return with thee  into thy land.\"    Naomi, however, thought they would be unhappy if they left their own  country, and she urged them to stay there and let her go alone; so one  of them kissed her over and over again and promised to do as she bade;  but the other, who was named Ruth, would not leave her.    \"Entreat me not to leave thee,\" she pleaded, \"or to return from  following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou  lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;  where thou diest I will die, and there will I be buried; the Lord do so  to me and more, also, if aught but death part thee and me.\"    Then Naomi stopped urging her to return, and they went together to  Bethlehem, where the friends of Naomi were very glad to welcome her and  greeted her in a very friendly manner, saying again and again, \"Is this  Naomi?\"    [Illustration: THE ASCENSION INTO HEAVEN.]    But she answered: \"Call me not Naomi, but call me Mara, for the Almighty  hath dealt very bitterly with me.\" She said this because Naomi means  \"pleasant\" and Mara means \"bitter,\" and the sorrowing widow felt that  her life was a bitter rather than a pleasant one, since she had been  bereaved of her husband and sons.

THE LIFE OF MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI      CHAPTER I      I    The Buonarroti Simoni, to whom Michelangelo belonged, were a  Florentine family of ancient burgher nobility. Their arms appear to  have been originally \"azure two bends or.\" To this coat was added \"a  label of four points gules inclosing three fleur-de-lys or.\" That  augmentation, adopted from the shield of Charles of Anjou, occurs upon  the scutcheons of many Guelf houses and cities. In the case of the  Florentine Simoni, it may be ascribed to the period when Buonarrota di  Simone Simoni held office as a captain of the Guelf party (1392).  Such, then, was the paternal coat borne by the subject of this Memoir.  His brother Buonarroto received a further augmentation in 1515 from  Leo X., to wit: \"upon a chief or, a pellet azure charged with  fleur-de-lys or, between the capital letters L. and X.\" At the same  time he was created Count Palatine. The old and simple bearing of the  two bends was then crowded down into the extreme base of the shield,  while the Angevine label found room beneath the chief.    According to a vague tradition, the Simoni drew their blood from the  high and puissant Counts of Canossa. Michelangelo himself believed in  this pedigree, for which there is, however, no foundation in fact, and  no heraldic corroboration. According to his friend and biographer  Condivi, the sculptor's first Florentine ancestor was a Messer Simone  dei Conti di Canossa, who came in 1250 as Podesta to Florence. \"The  eminent qualities of this man gained for him admission into the  burghership of the city, and he was appointed captain of a Sestiere;  for Florence in those days was divided into Sestieri, instead of  Quartieri, as according to the present usage.\" Michelangelo's  contemporary, the Count Alessandro da Canossa, acknowledged this  relationship. Writing on the 9th of October 1520, he addresses the  then famous sculptor as \"honoured kinsman,\" and gives the following  piece of information: \"Turning over my old papers, I have discovered  that a Messere Simone da Canossa was Podesta of Florence, as I have  already mentioned to the above-named Giovanni da Reggio.\"  Nevertheless, it appears now certain that no Simone da Canossa held  the office of Podesta at Florence in the thirteenth century. The  family can be traced up to one Bernardo, who died before the year  1228. His grandson was called Buonarrota, and the fourth in descent  was Simone. These names recur frequently in the next generations.  Michelangelo always addressed his father as \"Lodovico di Lionardo di  Buonarrota Simoni,\" or \"Louis, the son of Leonard, son of Buonarrota  Simoni;\" and he used the family surname of Simoni in writing to his  brothers and his nephew Lionardo. Yet he preferred to call himself  Michelangelo Buonarroti; and after his lifetime Buonarroti became  fixed for the posterity of his younger brother. \"The reason,\" says  Condivi, \"why the family in Florence changed its name from Canossa to  Buonarroti was this: Buonarroto continued for many generations to be  repeated in their house, down to the time of Michelangelo, who had a  brother of that name; and inasmuch as several of these Buonarroti held  rank in the supreme magistracy of the republic, especially the brother  I have just mentioned, who filled the office of Prior during Pope  Leo's visit to Florence, as may be read in the annals of that city,  this baptismal name, by force of frequent repetition, became the  cognomen of the whole family; the more easily, because it is the  custom at Florence, in elections and nominations of officers, to add  the Christian names of the father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and  sometimes even of remoter ancestors, to that of each citizen.  Consequently, through the many Buonarroti who followed one another,  and from the Simone who was the first founder of the house in  Florence, they gradually came to be called Buonarroti Simoni, which is  their present designation.\" Excluding the legend about Simone da  Canossa, this is a pretty accurate account of what really happened.  Italian patronymics were formed indeed upon the same rule as those of  many Norman families in Great Britain. When the use of Di and Fitz  expired, Simoni survived from Di Simone, as did my surname Symonds  from Fitz-Symond.    On the 6th of March 1475, according to our present computation,  Lodovico di Lionardo Buonarroti Simoni wrote as follows in his private  notebook: \"I record that on this day, March 6, 1474, a male child was  born to me. I gave him the name of Michelangelo, and he was born on a  Monday morning four or five hours before daybreak, and he was born  while I was Podesta of Caprese, and he was born at Caprese; and the  godfathers were those I have named below. He was baptized on the  eighth of the same month in the Church of San Giovanni at Caprese.  These are the godfathers:--      DON DANIELLO DI SER BUONAGUIDA of Florence,  Rector of San Giovanni at Caprese;    DON ANDREA DI .... of Poppi, Rector of the Abbey    of Diasiano (_i.e._, Dicciano);    JACOPO DI FRANCESCO of Casurio (?);    MARCO DI GIORGIO of Caprese;    GIOVANNI DI BIAGIO of Caprese;    ANDREA DI BIAGIO of Caprese;    FRANCESCO DI JACOPO DEL ANDUINO (?) of Caprese;    SER BARTOLOMMEO DI SANTI DEL LANSE (?), Notary.\"    Note that the date is March 6, 1474, according to Florentine usage _ab  incarnatione_, and according to the Roman usage, _a nativitate_, it is  1475.    Vasari tells us that the planets were propitious at the moment of  Michelangelo's nativity: \"Mercury and Venus having entered with benign  aspect into the house of Jupiter, which indicated that marvellous and  extraordinary works, both of manual art and intellect, were to be  expected from him.\"      II    Caprese, from its beauty and remoteness, deserved to be the birthplace  of a great artist. It is not improbable that Lodovico Buonarroti and  his wife Francesca approached it from Pontassieve in Valdarno,  crossing the little pass of Consuma, descending on the famous  battle-field of Campaldino, and skirting the ancient castle of the  Conti Guidi at Poppi. Every step in the romantic journey leads over  ground hallowed by old historic memories. From Poppi the road descends  the Arno to a richly cultivated district, out of which emerges on its  hill the prosperous little town of Bibbiena. High up to eastward  springs the broken crest of La Vernia, a mass of hard millstone rock  (_macigno_) jutting from desolate beds of lime and shale at the height  of some 3500 feet above the sea. It was here, among the sombre groves  of beech and pine which wave along the ridge, that S. Francis came to  found his infant Order, composed the Hymn to the Sun, and received the  supreme honour of the stigmata. To this point Dante retired when the  death of Henry VII. extinguished his last hopes for Italy. At one  extremity of the wedge-like block which forms La Vernia, exactly on  the watershed between Arno and Tiber, stands the ruined castle of  Chiusi in Casentino. This was one of the two chief places of Lodovico  Buonarroti's podesteria. It may be said to crown the valley of the  Arno; for the waters gathered here flow downwards toward Arezzo, and  eventually wash the city walls of Florence. A few steps farther,  travelling south, we pass into the valley of the Tiber, and, after  traversing a barren upland region for a couple of hours, reach the  verge of the descent upon Caprese. Here the landscape assumes a softer  character. Far away stretch blue Apennines, ridge melting into ridge  above Perugia in the distance. Gigantic oaks begin to clothe the stony  hillsides, and little by little a fertile mountain district of  chestnut-woods and vineyards expands before our eyes, equal in charm  to those aerial hills and vales above Pontremoli. Caprese has no  central commune or head-village. It is an aggregate of scattered  hamlets and farmhouses, deeply embosomed in a sea of greenery. Where  the valley contracts and the infant Tiber breaks into a gorge, rises a  wooded rock crowned with the ruins of "]]]
