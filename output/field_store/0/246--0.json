In that land, where some of my  happiest days have been spent, I have also experienced long periods of  intense excitement and anxiety; there I have made acquaintance with all  the charm of the veldt, in the vast country north of the great Zambesi  River, hearing the roar of the lions at night, and following their  \"spoor\" by day; and last, but not least, I have there made some very  good friends. Only a few years ago, when peacefully spending a few weeks  at Assouan in Egypt, I was nearly drowned by the capsizing of a boat in  the Nile; again the spirit of the vast continent (on this occasion far  away to the north) seemed to watch over me. For all these reasons I  venture to claim the indulgence of the public and the kindness of my  friends, for these recollections of days in South Africa, in which shade  and sunshine have been strangely mingled, and which to me have never  been dull. To sum up, I have always found that life is what you make it,  and have often proved the truth of the saying, \"Adventures to the  adventurous.\"    I am indebted to Colonel Vyvyan for statistics respecting the Mafeking  Relief Fund; and to Miss A. Fielding, secretary to the late Countess  Howe, for a resume of the work of the Yeomanry Hospital during the Boer  War.         S.I.W.

The above words, written by one of the greatest philosophers of olden  time, have often impressed me, and I have frequently quoted them when  asked why I did not write an account of the interesting travels and  adventures I have had in my life. It has therefore required a great deal  of courage to take up my pen and record a few recollections of South  Africa. I felt that, were they ever to be written at all, it must be  before the rapidly passing years diminish the interest in that land,  which in the past has been the object of such engrossing attention; and  that at the present time, when the impending Federation of South Africa  has at length crowned the hopes of those patriots who have laboured  patiently and hopefully to bring about this great result, it might be  appropriate to recall those days when Englishmen, who had made South  Africa their home, had much to contend with, even before the fierce  struggle to keep \"the flag flying\" in the years of 1899-1902.    During that period, which commenced after the disaster at Majuba Hill,  \"equal rights\" were a golden dream which only the most optimistic ever  hoped to see realized. From then onwards, as old colonists have so often  told me, the Boers brought up the younger generation in the belief that  the \"Roinek\"[1] was a coward, and in consequence their arrogance in the  country districts became wellnigh intolerable, while at the Cape the  Bond party grew so strong it bid fair to elbow out the English  altogether. Now, while the country is still young, the fair prospect  opens out of Briton and Boer living in amity and peace together, and  mutually supplying, in the government of their vast inheritance, such  elements as are wanting in the character of each.    My first visit to South Africa was a short one, and took place at the  end of 1895. During the foregoing summer everyone's attention had been  directed to the Transvaal, and more especially towards the Rand, by  reason of the unprecedented and, as it turned out, totally unwarranted  rise in the gold-mining shares of that district; in this boom, people  both at home and in Johannesburg madly gambled, and large fortunes were  quickly made by those who had foresight enough not to hold on too long.  For already the political horizon was darkening, and the wrongs of the  \"Uitlanders,\" real and apparent as they were, became a parrot-cry, which  waxed and waned, but never died away, till the ultimatum of President  Kruger, in October, 1899, brought matters to a climax.    We sailed from Southampton in December, 1895, in the _Tantallon Castle_,  then one of the most modern and up-to-date of the Castle liners. The  ship was crowded to its utmost capacity, and among the passengers, as I  afterwards learned, were many deeply concerned in the plotting which was  known to be going on at Johannesburg, either to extort concessions from  President Kruger, or, failing this, to remove him altogether. I knew  very little about all this then, but before I had been many days on  board it was not difficult to discover that much mystery filled the air,  and I was greatly excited at arriving in South Africa in such stirring  times. There is no such place for getting to know people well as on a  sea-voyage of eighteen days. Somehow the sea inspires confidence, and  one knows that information imparted cannot, anyway, be posted off by the  same day's mail. So those who were helping to pull the strings of this  ill-fated rebellion talked pretty freely of their hopes and fears during  the long, dark tropical evenings.    I became familiar with their grievances--their unfair taxation; no  education for their children except in Dutch; no representation in  Parliament--and this in a population in which, at that time, the  English and Afrikanders at Johannesburg and in the surrounding districts  outnumbered the Dutch in the proportion of about 6 to 1. They laid  stress on the fact that neither the Boers nor their children were, or  desired to become, miners, and, further, that for the enormous sums  spent on developing and working the mines no proper security existed. I  must admit it was the fiery-headed followers who talked the  loudest--those who had nothing to lose and much to gain. The financiers,  while directing and encouraging their zeal, seemed almost with the same  hand to wish to put on the brake and damp their martial ardour. In any  case, all were so eloquent that by the time our voyage was ended I felt  as great a rebel against \"Oom Paul\" and his Government as any one of  them.    Before leaving the _Tantallon Castle_, however, I must pass in review  some of those whose home it had been with ourselves for the best part of  three weeks. First I remember the late Mr. Alfred Beit, interesting as  the man who had made the most colossal fortune of all the South African  magnates, and who was then already said to be the most generous of  philanthropists and the kindest of friends; this reputation he fully  sustained in the subsequent years of his life and in the generous  disposition of his vast wealth. I have often been told that Mr. Cecil  Rhodes owed the inspiration of some of his colossal ideas to his friend  Mr. Beit, and when it came to financing the same, the latter was always  ready to assist in carrying out projects to extend and consolidate the  Empire. In these latter years, and since his comparatively early death,  I have heard those who still bear the brunt of the battle lament his  loss, and remark, when a railway was to be built or a new part of the  country opened up, how much more expeditiously it would be done were Mr.  Beit still alive.    Other names that occur to me are Mr. Abe Bailey, well known in racing  circles to-day, and then reputed a millionaire, the foundation of whose  fortune consisted in a ten-pound note borrowed from a friend. Mr. Wools  Sampson,[2] who subsequently so greatly distinguished himself at  Ladysmith, where he was dangerously wounded, had an individuality all  his own; he had seen every side of life as a soldier of fortune,  attached to different regiments, during all the fighting in South Africa  of the preceding years.

KUNO FRANCKE.            THE LIFE OF GUSTAV FREYTAG      By ERNEST F. HENDERSON, PH.D., L.H.D.    Author of _A History of Germany in the Middle Ages; A Short History of  Germany, etc._      It is difficult to assign to Gustav Freytag his exact niche in the  hall of fame, because of his many-sidedness. He wrote one novel of  which the statement has been made by an eminent French critic that no  book in the German language, with the exception of the Bible, has  enjoyed in its day so wide a circulation; he wrote one comedy which  for years was more frequently played than any other on the German  stage; he wrote a series of historical sketches--_Pictures of the  German Past_ he calls them--which hold a unique place in German  literature, being as charming in style as they are sound in  scholarship. Add to these a work on the principles of dramatic  criticism that is referred to with respect by the very latest writers  on the subject, an important biography, a second very successful  novel, and a series of six historical romances that vary in interest,  indeed, but that are a noble monument to his own nation and that,  alone, would have made him famous.    As a novelist Freytag is often compared with Charles Dickens, largely  on account of the humor that so frequently breaks forth from his  pages. It is a different kind of humor, not so obstreperous, not so  exaggerated, but it helps to lighten the whole in much the same way.  One moment it is an incongruous simile, at another a bit of sly  satire; now infinitely small things are spoken of as though they were  great, and again we have the reverse.    It is in his famous comedy, _The Journalists_, which appeared in 1853,  that Freytag displays his humor to its best advantage. Some of the  situations themselves, without being farcical, are exceedingly  amusing, as when the Colonel, five minutes after declaiming against  the ambition of journalists and politicians, and enumerating the  different forms under which it is concealed, lets his own ambition run  away with him and is won by the very same arts he has just been  denouncing. Again, Bolz's capture of the wine-merchant Piepenbrink at  the ball given under the auspices of the rival party is very cleverly  described indeed. There is a difference of opinion as to whether or  not Bolz was inventing the whole dramatic story of his rescue by  Oldendorf, but there can be no difference of opinion as to the  comicality of the scene that follows, where, under the very eyes of  his rivals and with the consent of the husband, Bolz prepares to kiss  Mrs. Piepenbrink. The play abounds with curious little bits of satire,  quaint similes and unexpected exaggerations. \"There is so much that  happens,\" says Bolz in his editorial capacity, \"and so tremendously  much that does not happen, that an honest reporter should never be at  a loss for novelties.\" Playing dominoes with polar bears, teaching  seals the rudiments of journalism, waking up as an owl with tufts of  feathers for ears and a mouse in one's beak, are essentially  Freytagian conceptions; and no one else could so well have expressed  Bolz's indifference to further surprises--they may tell him if they  will that some one has left a hundred millions for the purpose of  painting all negroes white, or of making Africa four-cornered; but he,  Bolz, has reached a state of mind where he will accept as truth  anything and everything.    Freytag's greatest novel, entitled _Soll und Haben_ (the technical  commercial terms for \"debit\" and \"credit\"), appeared in 1856. _Dombey  and Son_ by Dickens had been published a few years before and is worth  our attention for a moment because of a similarity of theme in the two  works. In both, the hero is born of the people, but comes in contact  with the aristocracy not altogether to his own advantage; in both,  looming in the background of the story, is the great mercantile house  with its vast and mysterious transactions. The writer of this short  article does not hesitate to place _Debit and Credit_ far ahead of  _Dombey and Son_. That does not mean that there are not single  episodes, and occasionally a character, in _Dombey and Son_ that the  German author could never have achieved. But, considered as an  artistic whole, the English novel is so disjointed and uneven that the  interest often flags and almost dies, while many of the characters are  as grotesque and wooden as so many jumping-jacks. In Freytag's work,  on the other hand, the different parts are firmly knitted together; an  ethical purpose runs through the whole, and there is a careful  subordination of the individual characters to the general plan of the  whole structure. It is much the same contrast as that between an  old-fashioned Italian opera and a modern German tone-drama. In the one  case the effects are made through senseless repetition and through  _tours de force_ of the voice; in the other there is a steady  progression in dramatic intensity, link joining link without a gap.    But to say that _Debit and Credit_ is a finer book than _Dombey and  Son_ is not to claim that Freytag, all in all, is a greater novelist  than Dickens. The man of a single fine book would have to be  superlatively great to equal one who could show such fertility in  creation of characters or produce such masterpieces of description.  Dickens reaches heights of passion to which Freytag could never  aspire; in fact the latter's temperament strikes one as rather a cool  one. Even Spielhagen, far inferior to him in many regards, could  thrill where Freytag merely interests.    Freytag's _forte_ lay in fidelity of depiction, in the power to  ascertain and utilize essential facts. It would not be fair to say  that he had little imagination, for in the parts of _The Ancestors_  that have to do with remote times, times of which our whole knowledge  is gained from a few paragraphs in old chronicles and where the  scenes and incidents have to be invented, he is at his best. But one  of his great merits lies in his evident familiarity with the  localities mentioned in the pages as well as with the social  environment of his personages. The house of T.D. Schroeter in _Debit  and Credit_ had its prototype in the house of Molinari in Breslau, and  at the Molinaris Freytag was a frequent visitor. Indeed in the company  of the head of the firm he even"]]]
