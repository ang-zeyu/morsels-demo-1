For some days past our table has been glittering with these caskets  of song and tale in their gay attire of silken sheen and burnished  gold--till their splendour has fairly put out the light of our  _sinumbra_, and the drabs, blues, and yellows of sober, business-like  quartos and octavos. Seven out of nine of these elegant little books are  in \"watered\" silk bindings; and an ingenious lady-friend has favoured us  with the calculation that the silk used in covering the presumed number  sold (70,000) would extend five miles, or from Hyde Park Corner to  Turnham Green.    Brilliant as may be their exteriors, their contents are, as Miss Jane  Porter says of her heroines, \"transcendently beautiful.\" But of these  we shall present our readers with some exquisite specimens. Our only  trouble in this task is the _embarras du richesses_ with which we are  surrounded; otherwise it is to us an exhaustless source of delight,  especially when we consider the \"gentle feelings and affections\" which  this annual distribution will cherish, and the innumerable intertwinings  of hands and hearts which this shower of _bon-bons_ will produce; and  such warm friends are we to this social scheme, that our presentation  copies are already in the fair hands whither we had destined them.    We begin with the parent-stock,      The Forget-Me-Not.      _Edited by Frederic Shoberl_, Esq.    The present volume, in its graphic and literary attractions is decidedly  superior to that of last year, an improvement which makes us credit what  the Ettrick Shepherd says of the proprietor--\"There's no a mair just,  nay, generous man in his dealings wi' his authors, in a' the tredd, than  Mr. Ackermann.\"    This beautiful Annual contains the original of our ENGRAVING, from a  plate by A. Freebairn, after an admirable picture by S. Prout, of which  the following story is illustrative:--      THE MAGICIAN OF VICENZA.      In the year 1796, on one of the finest evenings of an Italian autumn,  when the whole population of the handsome city of Vicenza were pouring  into the streets to enjoy the fresh air, that comes so deliciously along  the currents of its three rivers; when the Campo Marzo was crowded with  the opulent citizens and Venetian nobles; and the whole ascent, from the  gates to the Madonna who sits enthroned on the summit of Monte Berrico,  was a line of the gayest pilgrims that ever wandered up the vine-covered  side of an Alpine hill; the ears of all were caught by the sound of  successive explosions from a boat running down the bright waters of the  Bachiglione. Vicenza was at peace, under the wing of the lion of St.  Mark, but the French were lying round the ramparts of Mantua. They had  not yet moved on Venice; yet her troops were known to be without arms,  experience, or a general, and the sound of a cracker would have startled  her whole dominions.    The boat itself was of a singular make; and the rapidity with which this  little chaloupe, glittering with gilding and hung with streamers, made  its way along the sparkling stream, struck the observers as something  extraordinary. It flew by every thing on the river, yet no one was  visible on board. It had no sail up, no steersman, no rower; yet it  plunged and rushed along with the swiftness of a bird. The Vicentine  populace are behind none of their brethren in superstition, and at the  sight of the flying chaloupe, the groups came running from the Campo  Marzo. The Monte Berrico was speedily left without a pilgrim, and the  banks of the Bachiglione were, for the first time since the creation,  honoured with the presence of the Venetian authorities, and even of the  sublime podesta [the governor, a Venetian noble.] himself.    But it was fortunate for them that the flying phenomenon had reached the  open space formed by the conflux of the three rivers, before the crowd  became excessive; for, just as it had darted out from the narrow  channel, lined on both sides with the whole thirty thousand old,  middle-aged, and young, men, maids, and matrons of the city, a thick  smoke was seen rising from its poop, its frame quivered, and, with a  tremendous explosion, the chaloupe rose into the air in ten thousand  fragments of fire.    The multitude were seized with consternation; and the whole fell on  their knees, from the sublime podesta himself, to the humblest  saffron-gatherer. Never was there such a mixture of devotion. Never was  there such a concert of exclamations, sighs, callings on the saints, and  rattling of beads. The whole concourse lay for some minutes with their  very noses rubbing to the ground, until they were all roused at once by  a loud burst of laughter. Thirty thousand pair of eyes were lifted up at  the instant, and all fixed in astonishment on a human figure, seen  calmly sitting on the water, in the very track of the explosion, and  still half hidden in the heavy mass of smoke that curled in a huge globe  over the remnants. The laugh had proceeded from him, and the nearer he  approached the multitude, the louder he laughed. At length, stopping in  front of the spot where the sublime podesta, a little ashamed of his  prostration, was getting the dust shaken out of his gold-embroidered  robe of office, and bathing his burning visage in orange-flower water,  the stranger began a sort of complimentary song to the famous city of  Vicenza.    The stranger found a willing audience; for his first stanza was in  honour of the \"most magnificent city of Vicenza;\" its \"twenty palaces by  the matchless Palladio;\" much more \"its sixty churches;\" and much more  than all \"its breed of Dominicans, unrivalled throughout the earth for  the fervour of their piety and the capacity of their stomachs.\" The last  touch made the grand-prior of the cathedral wince a little, but it was  welcomed with a roar from the multitude. The song proceeded; but if the  prior had frowned at the first stanza, the podesta was doubly angry at  the second, which sneered at Venetian pomposity in incomparable style.  But the prior and podesta were equally outvoted, for the roar of the  multitude was twice as loud as before. Then came other touches on the  _cavalieri serventi_, the ladies, the nuns, and the husbands, till every  class had its share: but the satire was so witty, that, keen as it was,  the shouts of the people silenced all disapprobation. He finished by a  brilliant stanza, in which he said, that \"having been sent by Neptune  from the depths of the ocean to visit the earth, he had chosen for his  landing-place its most renowned spot, the birthplace of the gayest men  and the handsomest women--the exquisite Vicenza.\" With these words he  ascended from the shore, and was received with thunders of applause.    His figure was tall and elegant. He wore a loose, scarlet cloak thrown  over his fine limbs, Greek sandals, and a cap like that of the Italian  princes of three centuries before, a kind of low circle of green and  vermilion striped silk, clasped by a large rose of topaz. The men  universally said, that there was an atrocious expression in his  countenance; but the women, the true judges after all, said, without  exception, that this was envy in the men, and that the stranger was the  most \"delightful looking _Diavolo_\" they had ever set eyes on.    The stranger, on his landing, desired to be led to the principal hotel;  but he had not gone a dozen steps from the water-side, when he exclaimed  that he had lost his purse. Such an imputation was never heard before in  an Italian city; at least so swore the multitude; and the stranger was  on the point of falling several fathoms deep in his popularity. But he  answered the murmur by a laugh; and stopping in front of a beggar, who  lay at the corner of an hospital roaring out for alms, demanded the  instant loan of fifty sequins. The beggar lifted up his hands and eyes  in speechless wonder, and then shook out his rags, which, whatever else  they might show, certainly showed no sequins, \"The sequins, or death!\"  was the demand, in a tremendous voice. The beggar fell on the ground  convulsed, and from his withered hand, which every one had seen empty  the moment before, out flew fifty sequins, bright as if they had come  that moment from St. Mark's mint. The stranger took them from the  ground, and, with a smile, flung them up in a golden shower through the  crowd. The shouts were immense, and the mob insisted on carrying him to  the door of his hotel.    But the Venetian vigilance was by this time a little awakened, and a  patrol of the troops was ordered to bring this singular stranger before  the sublime podesta. The crowd instantly dropped him at the sight of the  bayonets, and knowing the value of life in the most delicious climate of  the world, took to their heels. The guard took possession of their  prisoner, and were leading him rather roughly to the governor's house,  when he requested them to stop for a moment beside a convent gate, that  he might get a cup of wine. But the Dominicans would not give the  satirist of their illustrious order a cup of water.    \"If you will not give me refreshment,\" exclaimed he, in an angry tone,  \"give me wherewithal to buy it. I demand a hundred sequins.\"    The prior himself was at the window above his head; and the only answer  was a sneer, which was loyally echoed through every cloister.    \"Let me have your bayonet for a moment,\" said the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11407"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration: NAVARINO AND THE ISLAND OF SPHAGIA.]      As our victories, though managed by the hand, are achieved by the head,  we feel little disposed to meddle with what Burke calls \"the mystery of  murder,\" or \"the present perfection of gunnery, cannoneering, bombarding,  and mining;\" and inveterate as may be the weapon of the goose-quill, we  trust our readers will not suspect us of any other policy than that of  pleasing them, the _ne plus ultra_ of all public servants. As our title  implies, we are bound to present or reflect in our pages certain  illustrations of popular topics, _veluti_ IN SPECULUM; accordingly, we  hope the accompanying _View and Plan of the Bay of Navarino_ will be  received in good season, _quod rerum est omnium primum_.    Thus far, the political or present interest attached to Navarino: with  the recent event which has raised, or we may say resuscitated such  interest, our readers have doubtless become familiar, and leaving the  ephemeral glory to the _Sun_ of all newspapers, and meaner \"chronicles  of the times,\" we shall proceed to the sober duty of describing the Bay  of Navarino, as, it will be seen, a place of some interest in the annals  of ancient as well as of modern warfare.    With our usual _literary honesty_, (we trust a characteristic of our  whole conduct,) we have to acknowledge our obligations to the \"Travels\"  of M. Pouqueville for the preceding view. \"The port of Navarino, certainly  one of the finest in the world,\" says Sir William Gell, in his interesting  _Journey in the Morea_, \"is formed by a deep indenture in the Morea, shut  in by a long island, anciently called Sphacteria, famous for the defeat  and capture of the Spartans, in the Peloponnesian war, and yet exhibiting  the vestige of walls, which may have served as their last refuge. This  island has been separated into three or four parts by the violence of the  waves, so that boats might pass from the open sea into the port in calm  weather, by means of the channel so formed. On one of the portions is the  tomb of a Turkish saint, or santon; and near the centre of the port is  another very small island, or rock.\" The modern name of the island is  _Sphagia_.    Navarino, called by the Turks _Avarin_, and the Greeks _Neo-Castron_, is  the Pylos of the ancients, and the supposed birthplace of the venerable  Nestor--standing upon a promontory at the foot of Mount Temathia, and  overlooking the vast harbour of the same name as the town. It is surrounded  only by a wall without a ditch; the height commanding the city is a little  hexagonal, defended by five towers at the external angles, which, with  the walls, were built by the Turks in 1572, but were never repaired till  after the war with the Russians in 1770; the Turks having previously taken  it from the Venetians in 1499. At the gate of the fortress is a miserable  Greek village; and the walls of the castle itself are in a dismantled  condition.    \"The town within the wall,\" says Sir W. Gell, \"is like all those in this  part of the world, encumbered with the fallen ruins of former habitations.  These have been generally constructed by the Turks, since the expulsion  of the Venetians; for it appears, that till the long continued habit of  possession had induced the Mahometans to live upon and cultivate their  estates in the country, and the power of the Venetian republic had been  consumed by a protracted peace, a law was enforced which compelled every  Turk to have a habitation in some one of the fortresses of the country.  But the habitatations,\" says our traveller, \"present generally an  indiscriminate mass of ruins; they were originally erected in haste, and  being often cemented with mud instead of mortar, the rains of autumn,  penetrating between the outer and inner faces of the walls, swell the  earth, and soon effect the ruin of the whole\"--it must be confessed, but  sorry structures for the _triple_ fires of an enemy. Sir William, on his  visit, found the commandant in a state of misery not exceeded by the lot  of his meanest fellow-citizens, except that his robes were somewhat in  better condition. He received him \"very kindly in a dirty unfurnished  apartment,\" into which he \"climbed by a tottering ladder from a court  strewed with ruins;\" here he gave him \"coffee,\" after which he took his  leave. What would a first lord of the Admiralty say to such a reception?  and it must have been somewhat uncourtly to our traveller.    The soil about Navarino is of a red colour, and is remarkable for the  production of an infinite quantity of squills, which are used in  medicine. The rocks, which show themselves in every direction through a  scanty but rich soil, are limestone, and present a general appearance of  unproductiveness round the castle of Navarino; and the absence of trees  is ill compensated by the profusion of sage, brooms, cistus, and other  shrubs which start from the innumerable cavities of the limestone.    The remains of Navarino Vecchio, or ancient Navarino, consist in a fort  or castle of mean construction, covering the summit of a hill sloping  quickly to the south, but falling in abrupt precipices to the north and  east. The town was built on the southern declivity, and was surrounded  by a wall, which, allowing for the natural irregularities of the soil,  represented a triangle, with the castle at the apex or summit--a form  observable in many of the ancient cities of Greece.    The foundation of the walls throughout the whole circuit remains entire;  but the fortifications were never of any consequence, though they present  a picturesque group of turrets and battlements from below, and must have  been very imposing from the sea,--an effect which those of the modern city  have recently failed to produce. From the top is an extensive view over  the island of Sphacteria, the port, with the town of Navarino to the  south, and a considerable tract of the territory anciently called Messenia  on the east, with the conic hill, which, though some miles from the shore,  is used as a landmark to point out the entrance of the port. Mr. Purdy, in  his _New Sailing Directory for the Mediterranean Sea_, says, \"from the  sea, a frigate might, in two or three hours, batter down the walls (of  Navarino); the artillery of the place (in 1825) consisted of forty pieces  of cannon; the greater part in the fort, eight on the battery at the  entrance of the harbour, and a few in some of the towers along the city.\"  It should be added that the port is said to be capable of containing 2,000  sail; and the population of the town is about 3,000, the most of whom are  Turks.    To the curious _dilettanti_ in dates, &c. (such as our friend _P.T.W._  &c.) the following almost coinciding circumstances may not prove  uninteresting:--The recent engagement took place on the anniversary of  the memorable battle of Salamis, 480 B.C. when the invading army of  Xerxes was defeated by the Greeks; and on which day Euripides, the Greek  tragic poet, was born: Nestor is said to have been born at Navarino, as  we have already mentioned: and, lastly, the attack, of which the subjoined  plan is illustrative, was made on the eve of the anniversary of the  glorious battle of Trafalgar, in which victory the vice-admiral of  Navarino, then captain of the Orient, was engaged.

The following is part of an old song which I have faithfully copied; it  was, I am told, sung at Wakes in the north of England, and also previous  to Christmas: from the appearance, little doubt is left as to its being  of northern composition.    I have seen in former volumes of the MIRROR, specimens of two ancient  ballads, and as they are a curiosity, I have sent mine as being, I think,  equally so. There is an old ballad which I have met with and purchased,  entitled \"The Outlandish Knight,\" but it is certainly greatly altered,  though the tale is preserved.      This ean night, this ean night,      Every night and awle,    Fire and fleet,[1] and candle lyght,      And Chryst receyve thy sawle.
