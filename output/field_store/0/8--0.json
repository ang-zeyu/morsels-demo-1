Not only  were emigrants from every part of the country preparing for the journey  to Oregon and California, but an unusual number of traders were making  ready their wagons and outfits for Santa Fe. Many of the emigrants,  especially of those bound for California, were persons of wealth and  standing. The hotels were crowded, and the gunsmiths and saddlers  were kept constantly at work in providing arms and equipments for the  different parties of travelers. Almost every day steamboats were leaving  the levee and passing up the Missouri, crowded with passengers on their  way to the frontier.    In one of these, the Radnor, since snagged and lost, my friend and  relative, Quincy A. Shaw, and myself, left St. Louis on the 28th of  April, on a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains. The  boat was loaded until the water broke alternately over her guards. Her  upper deck was covered with large weapons of a peculiar form, for  the Santa Fe trade, and her hold was crammed with goods for the same  destination. There were also the equipments and provisions of a party  of Oregon emigrants, a band of mules and horses, piles of saddles and  harness, and a multitude of nondescript articles, indispensable on  the prairies. Almost hidden in this medley one might have seen a small  French cart, of the sort very appropriately called a \"mule-killer\"  beyond the frontiers, and not far distant a tent, together with a  miscellaneous assortment of boxes and barrels. The whole equipage was  far from prepossessing in its appearance; yet, such as it was, it was  destined to a long and arduous journey, on which the persevering reader  will accompany it.    The passengers on board the Radnor corresponded with her freight. In her  cabin were Santa Fe traders, gamblers, speculators, and adventurers  of various descriptions, and her steerage was crowded with Oregon  emigrants, \"mountain men,\" negroes, and a party of Kansas Indians, who  had been on a visit to St. Louis.    Thus laden, the boat struggled upward for seven or eight days against  the rapid current of the Missouri, grating upon snags, and hanging for  two or three hours at a time upon sand-bars. We entered the mouth of  the Missouri in a drizzling rain, but the weather soon became clear,  and showed distinctly the broad and turbid river, with its eddies, its  sand-bars, its ragged islands, and forest-covered shores. The Missouri  is constantly changing its course; wearing away its banks on one  side, while it forms new ones on the other. Its channel is shifting  continually. Islands are formed, and then washed away; and while the old  forests on one side are undermined and swept off, a young growth springs  up from the new soil upon the other. With all these changes, the water  is so charged with mud and sand that it is perfectly opaque, and in  a few minutes deposits a sediment an inch thick in the bottom of a  tumbler. The river was now high; but when we descended in the autumn  it was fallen very low, and all the secrets of its treacherous shallows  were exposed to view. It was frightful to see the dead and broken trees,  thick-set as a military abatis, firmly imbedded in the sand, and all  pointing down stream, ready to impale any unhappy steamboat that at high  water should pass over that dangerous ground.    In five or six days we began to see signs of the great western movement  that was then taking place. Parties of emigrants, with their tents and  wagons, would be encamped on open spots near the bank, on their way to  the common rendezvous at Independence. On a rainy day, near sunset, we  reached the landing of this place, which is situated some miles from  the river, on the extreme frontier of Missouri. The scene was  characteristic, for here were represented at one view the most  remarkable features of this wild and enterprising region. On the muddy  shore stood some thirty or forty dark slavish-looking Spaniards, gazing  stupidly out from beneath their broad hats. They were attached to one of  the Santa Fe companies, whose wagons were crowded together on the banks  above. In the midst of these, crouching over a smoldering fire, was a  group of Indians, belonging to a remote Mexican tribe. One or two French  hunters from the mountains with their long hair and buckskin dresses,  were looking at the boat; and seated on a log close at hand were three  men, with rifles lying across their knees. The foremost of these, a  tall, strong figure, with a clear blue eye and an open, intelligent  face, might very well represent that race of restless and intrepid  pioneers whose axes and rifles have opened a path from the Alleghenies  to the western prairies. He was on his way to Oregon, probably a more  congenial field to him than any that now remained on this side the great  plains.    Early on the next morning we reached Kansas, about five hundred  miles from the mouth of the Missouri. Here we landed and leaving our  equipments in charge of my good friend Colonel Chick, whose log-house  was the substitute for a tavern, we set out in a wagon for Westport,  where we hoped to procure mules and horses for the journey.    It was a remarkably fresh and beautiful May morning. The rich and  luxuriant woods through which the miserable road conducted us were  lighted by the bright sunshine and enlivened by a multitude of birds. We  overtook on the way our late fellow-travelers, the Kansas Indians, who,  adorned with all their finery, were proceeding homeward at a round pace;  and whatever they might have seemed on board the boat, they made a very  striking and picturesque feature in the forest landscape.    Westport was full of Indians, whose little shaggy ponies were tied by  dozens along the houses and fences. Sacs and Foxes, with shaved heads  and painted faces, Shawanoes and Delawares, fluttering in calico frocks,  and turbans, Wyandottes dressed like white men, and a few wretched  Kansas wrapped in old blankets, were strolling about the streets, or  lounging in and out of the shops and houses.    As I stood at the door of the tavern, I saw a remarkable looking person  coming up the street. He had a ruddy face, garnished with the stumps of  a bristly red beard and mustache; on one side of his head was a round  cap with a knob at the top, such as Scottish laborers sometimes wear;  his coat was of a nondescript form, and made of a gray Scotch plaid,  with the fringes hanging all about it; he wore pantaloons of coarse  homespun, and hob-nailed shoes; and to complete his equipment, a little  black pipe was stuck in one corner of his mouth. In this curious attire,  I recognized Captain C. of the British army, who, with his brother, and  Mr. R., an English gentleman, was bound on a hunting expedition across  the continent. I had seen the captain and his companions at St. Louis.  They had now been for some time at Westport, making preparations for  their departure, and waiting for a re-enforcement, since they were too  few in number to attempt it alone. They might, it is true, have joined  some of the parties of emigrants who were on the point of setting out  for Oregon and California; but they professed great disinclination to  have any connection with the \"Kentucky fellows.\"    The captain now urged it upon us, that we should join forces and proceed  to the mountains in company. Feeling no greater partiality for the  society of the emigrants than they did, we thought the arrangement an  advantageous one, and consented to it. Our future fellow-travelers had  installed themselves in a little log-house, where we found them all  surrounded by saddles, harness, guns, pistols, telescopes, knives, and  in short their complete appointments for the prairie. R., who professed  a taste for natural history, sat at a table stuffing a woodpecker; the  brother of the captain, who was an Irishman, was splicing a trail-rope  on the floor, as he had been an amateur sailor. The captain pointed  out, with much complacency, the different articles of their outfit. \"You  see,\" said he, \"that we are all old travelers. I am convinced that no  party ever went upon the prairie better provided.\" The hunter whom they  had employed, a surly looking Canadian, named Sorel, and their muleteer,  an American from St. Louis, were lounging about the building. In a  little log stable close at hand were their horses and mules, selected by  the captain, who was an excellent judge.    The alliance entered into, we left them to complete their arrangements,  while we pushed our own to all convenient speed. The emigrants for whom  our friends professed such contempt were encamped on the prairie about  eight or ten miles distant, to the number of a thousand or more, and new  parties were constantly passing out from Independence to join them.  They were in great confusion, holding meetings, passing resolutions, and  drawing up regulations, but unable to unite in the choice of leaders to  conduct them across the prairie. Being at leisure one day, I rode over  to Independence. The town was crowded. A multitude of shops had sprung  up to furnish the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#1)"],[1,"_AMERICAN LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS_    SERIES OF 1914-1915          Mohammedanism    Lectures on Its Origin, Its Religious and Political Growth, and Its Present  State        by        C.

Ginn & Company of Boston. Prof. Jastrow's  volume is, therefore, the eighth in the series.]    [Footnote 2: Owing to special circumstances, Prof. Cumont's volume was  published before that of Prof. DeGroot. It is, therefore, the ninth in the  series and that of Prof. DeGroot the tenth.]    The lecturer for 1914 was Professor C. Snouck Hurgronje. Born in  Oosterhout, Holland, in 1857, he studied Theology and Oriental Languages  at the University of Leiden and continued his studies at the University of  Strassburg. In 1880 he published his first important work _Het Mekkaansch  Feest_, having resolved to devote himself entirely to the study of  Mohammedanism in its widest aspects. After a few years' activity as  Lecturer on Mohammedan Law at the Seminary for Netherlands-India in Leiden,  he spent eight months (1884-5) in Mecca and Jidda. In 1888, he became  lecturer at the University of Leiden and in the same year was sent out  as Professor to Batavia in Netherlands-India, where he spent the years  1889-1906. Upon his return he was appointed Professor of Arabic at the  University of Leiden. Among his principal published works may be mentioned:  _Mekka_, The Hague, 1888-9; _De Beteekenis van den Islam voor zijne  Belijders in Oost Indie_, Leiden, 1883; _Mekkanische Sprichwoerter_, The  Hague, 1886; _De Atjehers_, Leiden, 1903-4, England tr. London, 1906; _Het  Gajoland en zijne Bezvoners_, Batavia, 1903, and _Nederland en de Islam_,  Leiden, 1915.    The lectures to be found in the present volume were delivered before  the following Institutions: Columbia University, Yale University, The  University of Pennsylvania, Meadville Theological Seminary, The University  of Chicago, The Lowell Institute, and the Johns Hopkins University.    The Committee owes a debt of deep gratitude to Mr. Charles R. Crane for  having made possible the course of lectures for the year 1914.    RICHARD GOTTHEIL    CRAWFORD H.

THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ISLAM.    ISLAM AND MODERN THOUGHT.    INDEX.            Mohammedanism      I    SOME POINTS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF ISLAM      There are more than two hundred million people who call themselves after  the name of Mohammed, would not relinquish that name at any price, and  cannot imagine a greater blessing for the remainder of humanity than to be  incorporated into their communion. Their ideal is no less than that the  whole earth should join in the faith that there is no god but Allah and  that Mohammed is Allah's last and most perfect messenger, who brought the  latest and final revelation of Allah to humanity in Allah's own words. This  alone is enough to claim our special interest for the Prophet, who in the  seventh century stirred all Arabia into agitation and whose followers soon  after his death founded an empire extending from Morocco to China.    Even those who--to my mind, not without gross exaggeration--would seek the  explanation of the mighty stream of humanity poured out by the Arabian  peninsula since 630 over Western and Middle Asia, Northern Africa, and  Southern Europe principally in geographic and economic causes, do not  ignore the fact that it was Mohammed who opened the sluice gates. It would  indeed be difficult to maintain that without his preaching the Arabs of the  seventh century would have been induced by circumstances to swallow up  the empire of the Sasanids and to rob the Byzantine Empire of some of its  richest provinces. However great a weight one may give to political and  economic factors, it was religion, Islam, which in a certain sense united  the hitherto hopelessly divided Arabs, Islam which enabled them to found  an enormous international community; it was Islam which bound the speedily  converted nations together even after the shattering of its political  power, and which still binds them today when only a miserable remnant of  that power remains.    The aggressive manner in which young Islam immediately put itself in  opposition to the rest of the world had the natural consequence of  awakening an interest which was far from being of a friendly nature.  Moreover men were still very far from such a striving towards universal  peace as would have induced a patient study of the means of bringing the  different peoples into close spiritual relationship, and therefore from an  endeavour to understand the spiritual life of races different to their own.  The Christianity of that time was itself by no means averse to the  forcible extension of its faith, and in the community of Mohammedans which  systematically"]]]
