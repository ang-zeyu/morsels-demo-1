From remote antiquity, when the seditious were taken _ad furcas  Tyburnam_, until that November day in 1783 when John Austin closed the  long list, the gallows were kept ever busy, and during the first half of  the eighteenth century, with which this book deals, every Newgate  sessions sent thither its thieves, highwaymen and coiners by the score.    There has been some discussion as to the exact site of Tyburn gallows,  but there can be little doubt that the great permanent three-beamed  erection--the Triple Tree--stood where now the Edgware Road joins Oxford  Street and Bayswater Road. A triangular stone let into the roadway  indicates the site of one of its uprights. In 1759 the sinister beams  were pulled down, a moveable gibbet being brought in a cart when there  was occasion to use it. The moveable gallows was in use until 1783, when  the place of execution was transferred to Newgate; the beams of the old  structure being sawn up and converted to a more genial use as stands for  beer-butts in a neighbouring public-house.    The original gallows probably consisted of two uprights with a  cross-piece, but when Elizabeth's government felt that more adequate  means must be provided to strengthen its subjects' faith and enforce the  penal laws against Catholics, a new type of gibbet was sought. So in  1571 the triangular one was erected, with accommodation for eight such  miscreants on each beam, or a grand total of twenty-four at a  stringing. It was first used for the learned Dr. John Story, who, upon  June 1st, \"was drawn upon a hurdle from the Tower of London unto Tyburn,  where was prepared for him a new pair of gallows made in triangular  manner\". There is rather a gruesome tale of how, when in pursuance of  the sentence the executioner had cut him down and was \"rifling among his  bowels\", the doctor arose and dealt him a shrewd blow on the head.  Doctor Story was followed by a long line of priests, monks, laymen and  others who died for their faith to the number of some three thousand.  And the Triple Tree, the Three-Legged Mare, or Deadly Never-green, as  the gallows were called with grim familiarity, flourished for another  two hundred years.    In the early eighteenth century it appears to have been the usual custom  to reserving sentencing until the end of the sessions, but as soon as  the jury's verdict of guilty was known steps were taken to procure a  pardon by the condemned man's friends. They had, indeed, much more  likelihood of success in those times when the Law was so severe than in  later days when capital punishment was reserved for the most heinous  crimes. On several occasions in the following pages mention is made of  felons urging their friends to bribe or make interest in the right  quarters for obtaining a pardon, or commutation of the sentence to one  of transportation. It was not until the arrival of the death warrant  that the condemned man felt that the \"Tyburn tippet\" was really being  drawn about his neck.    No better description can be given of the ride to Tyburn tree, from  Newgate and along Holborn, than that furnished by one of the _Familiar  Letters_ written by Samuel Richardson in 1741:        I mounted my horse and accompanied the melancholy cavalcade from      Newgate to the fatal Tree. The criminals were five in number. I was      much disappointed at the unconcern and carelessness that appeared in      the faces of three of the unhappy wretches; the countenance of the      other two were spread with that horror and despair which is not to      be wondered at in men whose period of life is so near, with the      terrible aggravation of its being hastened by their own voluntary      indiscretion and misdeeds. The exhortation spoken by the Bell-man,      from the wall of St. Sepulchre's churchyard is well intended; but      the noise of the officers and the mob was so great, and the silly      curiosity of people climbing into the cart to take leave of the      criminals made such a confused noise that I could not hear the      words of the exhortation when spoken, though they are as follows:          All good people pray heartily to God for these poor sinners, who are      now going to their deaths; for whom this great bell doth toll.          You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears. Ask      mercy of the Lord for the salvation of your own souls through the      merits, death and passion of Jesus Christ, Who now sits at the right      hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently      return unto Him.          Lord, have mercy upon you! Christ have mercy upon you!        Which last words the Bell-man repeats three times.        All the way up to Holborn the crowd was so great as at every twenty      or thirty yards to obstruct the passage; and wine, notwithstanding a      late good order against this practice, was brought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#1)"],[1,"DECAMERON    OF    GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO    Faithfully Translated    By J.M.
