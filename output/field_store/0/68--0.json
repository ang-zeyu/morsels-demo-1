Vol. 10, No. 273. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1827. PRICE 2d.        GASPARD MONGE'S MAUSOLEUM.      [Illustration]    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)    Sir,--As one of your correspondents has favoured you with a drawing of  the gaol I designed for the city and county of Norwich, with which you  have embellished a recent number of the MIRROR, I flatter myself that an  engraving from the drawing I herewith send you of the mausoleum of  Gaspard Monge, which I drew while at Paris, in 1822, will also be  interesting to the readers of your valuable little miscellany. Gaspard  Monge, whose remains are deposited in the burying ground in Pere la  Chaise, at Paris, in a magnificent mausoleum, was professor of geometry  in the Polytechnique School at Paris, and with Denon accompanied  Napoleon Bonaparte on his memorable expedition to Egypt; one to make  drawings of the architectural antiquities and sculpture, and the other  the geographical delineations of that ancient country. He returned to  Paris, where he assisted Denon in the publication of his antiquities. At  his decease the pupils of the Polytechnique School erected this  mausoleum to his memory, as a testimony of their esteem, after a design  made by his friend, Monsieur Denon. The mausoleum is of Egyptian  architecture, with which Denon had become familiarly acquainted.    There is a bust of Monge placed on a terminal pedestal underneath a  canopy in the upper compartment, which canopy is open in front and in  the back. In the crown cavetto of the cornice is an Egyptian winged  globe, entwined with serpents, emblematical of time and eternity; and on  the faci below is engraved the following line:--        A. GASPARD MONGE.    On each side of the upper compartment is inscribed the following  _memento mori_:        LES ELEVES      DE L'ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE.      A.G. MONGE.      COMTE DE PELUSE.    Underneath this inscription is carved in sunk work an Egyptian lotus  flower in an upright position; on the back of the mausoleum is the date  of the year in which Gaspard Monge died. The body is in the cemetery  below.        AN. MDCCCXX.    Monge was a man of considerable merit as a geometrician, and, while  living, stood preeminent above his contemporaries in the French school  of that day. He is the author of several works, but his most popular one  is entitled \"Geometrie Descriptive. par G. Monge, de l'Institut des  Sciences, Lettres et Arts, de l'Ecole Polytechnique; Membre du Senat  Conservateur, Grand Officier de la Legion d'Honeur et Cointe de  l'Empire.\"    The programme to this work is interesting, as it urges the necessity of  making geometry a branch of the national education, and points out the  beneficial results that would arise therefrom. The following is the  translation:--    To draw the French nation from the dependence, which, even in the  present day it is obliged to place in foreign industry, it is necessary  first to direct the national education towards the knowledge of those  objects which require a correctness which hitherto has been totally  neglected; to accustom the hands of our artists to the management of the  various instruments that are necessary to measure the different degrees  of work, and to execute them with precision; then the finisher becomes  sensible of the accuracy it will require in the different works, and he  will be enabled to set the necessary value on it. For our artists to  become, from their youth, familiar with geometry, and to be in a  condition to attain it, it is necessary in the second place to render  popular the knowledge of a great number of natural phenomena that are  indispensable to the progress of industry; they will then profit for the  advancement of the general instruction of the nation, which by a  fortunate circumstance it has at its disposal, the principal resources  that are necessary for it. Lastly, it is requisite to extend among our  artists the knowledge of the advancement of the arts and that of  machines, whose object is either to diminish manual labour or to give to  the result of labour more uniformity and precision; and on those heads  it must be confessed we have much to draw from foreign nations.[1] All  these views can only be accomplished by giving a new turn to national  education.        [1] Monsieur Monge has drawn much from our countryman,      Hamilton's work on Stereography but he has not mentioned his      work.    This is to be done, in the first place, by making all intelligent young  men (who are born with a fortune) familiar with the use of descriptive  geometry, so that they may be able to employ their capital more  profitably both for themselves and the nation, and also for those who  have no other fortune than their education, so that their labour will  bring them the greater reward. This art has two principal objects, the  first to represent with exactness, from drawings which have only two  dimensions, objects which have three, and which are susceptible of a  strict definition; under this point of view it is a language necessary  to the man of genius when he conceives a project, and to those who are  to have the direction of it; and lastly, to the artists who are  themselves to execute the different parts.    The second object of descriptive geometry, is to deduce from the exact  description of bodies all that necessarily follows of their forms and  their respective positions; in this sense it is a means of seeking  truth, as it offers perpetual examples of the passage from what is known  to what is unknown, and as it is always applied to objects susceptible  of the minutest evidence, it is necessary that it should form part of  the plan of a national education. It is not only fit to exercise the  intellectual faculties of a great people, and to contribute thereby to  the perfection of mankind, but it is also indispensable to all workmen,  whose end is to give to certain bodies determined forms, and it is  principally owing to the methods of this art having been too little  extended, or in fact almost entirely neglected, that the progress of our  industry has been so slow. We shall contribute then to give an  advantageous direction to national education, by making our young artist  familiar with the application of descriptive geometry, to the graphic  constructions which are necessary in the greater number of the arts, and  in making use of this geometry in the representation and determination  of the elements of machinery, by means of which, man by the aid of the  forces of nature, reserves for himself, in a manner, in his operations  no other labour than that of his intellects. It is no less advantageous  to extend the knowledge of those phenomena of nature which may be turned  to the profit of the arts. The charm which accompanies them will  overcome the repugnance that men have in general for manual operations,  (which most regard as painful and laborious,) as it will make them find  pleasure in the exercise of their intellect; thus there ought to be in  the formal school a course of descriptive geometry.    As yet we have no well compiled elementary work on that art, because  till this time learned men have taken too little interest in it, or it  has only been practised in an obscure manner by persons whose education  had not been sufficiently extended, and were unable to communicate the  result of their lucubrations. A course simply oral would be absolutely  without effect. It is necessary then, for the course of descriptive  geometry, that practice and execution be joined to the hearing of  methods; thus pupils will be exercised in graphic construction of  descriptive geometry. The graphic arts have general methods with which  we can only become familiar by the use of the rule and compass. Among  the different applications that may be made of descriptive geometry,  there are _two_ which are remarkable, both for their universality and  their ingenuity; these are the constructions of _perspective_ and the  strict determination of the _shadows_. These two parts may finally be  considered as the completion of the art of describing objects.    R.

It is now more than twenty years since the late Lord Londonderry was,  for the first time, on a visit to a gentleman in the north of Ireland.  The mansion was such a one as spectres are fabled to inhabit. It was  associated with many recollections of historic times, and the sombre  character of its architecture, and the wildness of its surrounding  scenery, were calculated to impress the soul with that tone of  melancholy and elevation, which,--if it be not considered as a  predisposition to welcome the visitation of those unearthly substances  that are impalpable to our sight in moments of less hallowed  sentiment,--is indisputably the state of mind in which the imagination  is most readily excited, and the understanding most favourably inclined  to grant a credulous reception to its visions. The apartment also which  was appropriated to Lord Londonderry, was calculated to foster such a  tone of feeling. From its antique appointments; from the dark and  richly-carved panels of its wainscot; from its yawning width and height  of chimney--looking like the open entrance to a tomb, of which the  surrounding ornaments appeared to form the sculptures and the  entablature;--from the portraits of grim men and severe-eyed women,  arrayed in orderly procession along the walls, and scowling a  contemptuous enmity against the degenerate invader of their gloomy  bowers and venerable halls; from the vast, dusky, ponderous, and  complicated draperies that concealed the windows, and hung with the  gloomy grandeur of funereal trappings about the hearse-like piece of  furniture that was destined for his bed,--Lord L., on entering his  apartment, might be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11389"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

WHY ARE NOT THE ENGLISH A MUSICAL PEOPLE?          We cannot help it.--_Massinger's Roman Actor._    Astronomy, music, and architecture, are the floating topics of the day;  on the second of these heads we have thrown together a few hints, which  may, probably prove entertaining to our readers.    The English are not--you know, reflective public--a musical people; this  has been said over and over again in the musical and dramatic critiques  of the newspapers. True it is that we have no _national music_, like our  neighbours the Welsh, the Irish, or the Scotch; for our music, like out  language, is a mere _riccifamento_, stolen from every nation in Europe.  But our king (God bless him) is an excellent musician, and plays the  violoncello most delightfully; and we have an Academy of Music. Then we  have an Italian Theatre that burns the feet and fingers of all who  meddle with its management--witness, Mr. Ebers, who, by being \"married\"  to sweet sounds, lost the enormous sum of 47,000_l_.--it must be owned,  an unfortunate match, or as Dr. Franklin would have said, \"paying rather  too dear for his whistle.\" We have too an _English Opera House_, where  scarcely any but _foreign_ music is heard, and which, to the  ever-lasting credit of its management, has transplanted from the warm  climes of the south to our ungenial atmosphere, some of the finest  compositions in the continental schools of modern music. Success has,  however, attended most of their enterprises; for the taste of the  English for foreign music is by no means a modern mania. From Pepys's  _Diary_ we learn that the first company of Italian singers came here in  the reign of Charles II.: they were brought by Killigrew from Venice,  about 1688; but they did not perform whole operas, only detached scenes  in recitative, and not in any public theatre, but in the houses of the  nobility. Thus, Italian music was loved and cultivated very early in  England, and London was the next capital, after Vienna, which  established and supported an Italian Opera. But, as we never do things  by halves, we had soon afterwards, two opposition houses. This proves  that the English have a _taste for music_; indeed they have much more  judgment than some of their neighbours, which makes it still more to be  regretted that nothing is done in England towards the advancement of  music as a science. Is the world of sound and the soul of song  exhausted? Why should we, who are marching in every other direction,  stand still in this? But no; what Orpheus did with _music_, we are  striving to accomplish by _steam_; what he effected by quietly touching  his lyre, we study with the atmospheres and condensers of high and low  pressure engines.    The writer of a delightful paper in the _Foreign Review_, No. 3, in  tracing the rise and progress of music, inquires what has become of \"its  loftier pretensions, its celestial attributes, its moral and political  influence.\" He then facetiously observes, \"How should we marvel to see  the Duke of Wellington, like another Epaminondas, take his flute out of  his pocket to still the clamour of the opposition, or Mr. Peel reply to  the arguments of Mr. Huskisson with an allegro on the fiddle.\"    The Greeks were not such grave people as some may be inclined to think  them. Among them, poetry and music were so intimately connected, that  they were in fact one and the same. It is not so with us; we have Byron  and Moore, in poetry; but where are their parallels in English music!    \"Music,\" says Plutarch, \"was the universal language of Greece, the  sacred vehicle of history, philosophy, laws, and morals;\" but in England  it is little more than a mere amusement to while away the evening, or at  best, but a branch of _female_ education. Pianos are become articles of  furniture to be met with in almost every other genteel house; Miss and  her sisters sit down by turns, and screw themselves up to _Ah vous  dirai_, or \"I'd be a butterfly\"--till some handsome young fellow who has  stood behind her chair for six months, turned over her music, or  accompanied her through a few liquorish airs, vows his tender passion,  brings her the last new song, and at length swears to be her  accompaniment throughout life. The piano is then locked up, the music  sent to Bath or _Canterbury_, and the lady is married and cannot sing.    But the Greek poets sang their own verses: \"Homer literally _sang_ the  wrath of Achilles, and the woes of Greece;\" would it were so in England.  Then, my poetical public, we should have Anacreon Moore singing his  \"Rich and rare were the gems she wore,\" in some such place as the  Quadrant, or Opera Colonnade; and Sir Walter Scott celebrating the Field  of Waterloo, not in the broad-margined octavos of Paternoster-row, but  about the purlieus of the Horse Guards. Wordsworth would be his own  Skylark. The laureate, Southey, would perch himself on the dome of the  New Palace. Campbell would step out of New Burlingtonstreet into the  Park; Miss Mitford would keep a Covent-Garden audience awake with her  own tragedies, and Planche would no longer entrust his rhymes to Paton  or Vestris. On the other hand, Braham would no longer be indebted to  Moore for his songs, Bishop would write, compose, and sing his own  operas, and all our vocalists enter, like Dryden's king and two  fiddlers, _solus_!    Could we but once become a musical people, we should no longer marvel at  the effect of music in ancient times; for who knows but that if an  Englishman were to play like Orpheus, the River Thames might cease to  flow; the disposal of Mr. Cross's menagerie be no longer a question,  since the animals might be allowed to ramble about the Strand; and  Snowdon or Cader Idris journey to the King's Theatre to listen to his  inspirations.    It is, however, impossible to calculate the benefits which this  acquisition of musical skill might prove to the English people. What  bloodshed and tribulation it would prevent. Weare, or Maria Marten, like  Stradella, might have disarmed their assassins; the Insolvent Act would  be obsolete, and duns defeated; since hundreds of improvident wights,  like Palma, might, by their strains, soften the hearts of their  creditors, and draw tears from sheriff's officers. Chancery-lane would  be depopulated, and Cursitor-street be left to the fowls of the air;  locks would fall 50 per cent, and Mr. Bramah might betake himself to Van  Dieman's Land. What a pleasant thing would a public dinner be; for,  instead of a gentleman in a dress coat singing as from the orchestra of  an oratorio, he would throw a more impassioned energy into his own  compositions than he could possibly impart to those of another, and  proportionally enhance the delight of his company. All the mechanism of  professional singing would then give way to \"the feast of reason and the  flow of soul.\"    We know not how to have done with these pleasures of \"linked  sweetness\"--this \"mosaic of the air,\" as Marvell quaintly calls it. We  have a decided aversion to the system of borrowing, which, in the  absence of our own musical resources, seems to be universally adopted.  Thus, as Charles Mathews says, \"every footman whistles _Frieschutz_;\"  and the barrel organ which does not play two or three of its airs may be  consigned to the brokers. A few months since every bachelor hummed or  whistled \"_C'est l'amour_,\" and the French, to return the compliment,  have made our \"Robin Adair,\" one of the claptraps of the music of their  _La Dame Blanche_. Next, when will Mr. Bishop's _Home, sweet home_, be  forgotten, although the original is a Sicilian air of considerable  antiquity. All the baker's and butcher's boys in London can go through  \"_Di tanti pal_\"--where they leave off, answer a question, and take up  the \"_piti_,\" with the skill of a musician; and as readily fall into the  sympathetic melodies of \"_Oh no we never mention her_,\" or the \"_Light  Guitar_.\" But to atone for these vulgarisms, who that has heard the  syren strains of Stephens or Paton, or the Anglo-Italian style of  Braham, but has envied them the pleasurable monopoly of delighting  thousands, and sending them home with the favourite air still echoing in  their ears, and lulling them to soft slumbers! Who is there that has  enjoyed his circle of friends without regretting a thousand times that  he had not a fiftieth part of such talent to enliven the festive hour,  and lend a charm, however, fleeting, to what may be termed the poetry of  life.    As we have noticed the taste of the Greeks for music, it is but fair  that we should allude to that of their successors. In ancient Rome,  music was never popular. Combats of gladiators and wild beasts filled  their theatres with streams of blood, instead of their resounding with  music; and after the death of Nero,[1] that beautiful art was declared  infamous, and by a public decree, banished from the city. In our  theatres, however, heroes fight to music, from the Richard III. and  Richmond of Shakspeare to the \"terrific combats\" of modern melodrame.        [1] \"When Nero exhibited himself as a singer and flute-player on      the stage at Naples, the musicians of that province assembled to      hear him; and Suetonius tells us that the emperor selected _five      thousand_ among the best to be his household musicians, and      clothed them in a rich and uniform dress.\"    Anything is, however, better than despair, and let us hope that  something may be done towards the amendment of our musical reputation.  We have too much of what Cobbett would call the \"dead-weight\" in us to  become adopted by Apollo as the \"children of song;\" but what with the  school of music in Tenterden-street, and numberless juvenile prodigies,  we may indulge the expectation of rising in the diatonic scale,"]]]
