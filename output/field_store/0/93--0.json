Of  one hundred and fifty persons embarked upon the raft, and left to their  fate, only fifteen remained alive thirteen days afterwards; but of these  fifteen, so miraculously saved, life constituted the sole possession, being  literally stripped of every thing. At Paris, some benevolent individuals  have recently opened a subscription for their relief. Should any persons,  in this country, feel disposed to contribute to this humane object, Mr.  Colburn will feel great pleasure in becoming the medium for transmitting  their subscriptions to the unfortunate sufferers._                            NARRATIVE                    OF A              VOYAGE TO SENEGAL                  IN 1816;    UNDERTAKEN BY ORDER OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT,            COMPRISING AN ACCOUNT                   OF THE           Shipwreck of the Medusa,         THE SUFFERINGS OF THE CREW,  AND THE VARIOUS OCCURRENCES ON BOARD THE RAFT,      IN THE DESERT OF ZAARA, AT ST.

At the moment that we publish a Second Edition of our Narrative, we learn  that Mr. Sevigny [A] is going to publish a pretended Account, by Mr.  Richefort, an auxiliary Ex-Officer of the French Marine.    Our readers will not have forgotten a certain pretended sea-officer who was  partly the cause of our misfortunes, and who, when on board the Medusa,  gave such unhappy advice to the captain, who still more unhappily, followed  it too closely; well; this _ex-officer_, this fatal _auxiliary_, who  conducted the frigate upon the bank of Arguin, is no other than Mr.  Richefort!    Having gone on board the governor's boat, he remained a stranger to the  disasters which he had partly caused, and consequently, knew nothing of  what passed, either upon the raft, or on board the boats which stranded, or  in the desert.    We make no farther remarks; the public will judge of his account and ours.    CORREARD AND SAVIGNY.    [A] This Mr. Sevigny must not be confounded with Mr. Savigny, one of the  authors of this narrative.    This Mr. Sevigny is one of the directors of an anonymous company, which one  of the King's Ministers has recommended in the following manner:    \"The keeper of the seals has informed the magistrates, that an anonymous  company, which had formed itself under the name of the _Colonial  Philanthropic Society of Senegambia_, and which announced the project of  procuring for all those who should confide in it, colonial establishments  on the coasts near Cape Verd, has received no authority from the  government, and that, on the steps which it has taken, to obtain such  authority, it has been found that it was not in a condition to fulfil its  promises, which, therefore, were a kind of snare, for those whom they might  have seduced. It has been, consequently, prohibited from making any  enterprise, or any expedition. The agents of this Society having no other  object than to deceive the public credulity, must be denounced to his  Majesty's Attorney-General, who will take against them the measures  prescribed by the law.\"    (_Journal des Debats, Novembre _24, 1817.)            PREFACE.      The annals of the marine, record no example of a shipwreck so terrible as  that of the Medusa frigate. Two of the unfortunate crew, who have  miraculously escaped from the catastrophe, impose upon themselves the  painful and delicate task, of describing all the circumstances which  attended it.    It was in the midst of the most cruel sufferings that we took the solemn  resolution, to make known, to the civilized world, all the details of our  unhappy adventure, if heaven permitted us again to see our dear country. We  should believe that we failed in our duty to ourselves, and to our fellow  citizens, if we left buried in oblivion facts which the public must be  desirous to know. All the details of the events at which we were not  present, have been communicated to us by respectable persons, who have  warranted their authenticity. We shall, besides, advance nothing which  cannot be proved.    Here, we hear some voices ask, what right we have to make known to the  government, men who are, perhaps, guilty, but whom their places, and their  rank, entitle to more respect. They are ready to make it a crime in us,  that we have dared to say, that officers of the marine had abandoned us.  But what interest, we ask, in our turn, should cause a fatal indulgence to  be claimed for those, who have failed in their duties; while the  destruction of a hundred and fifty wretches, left to the most cruel fate,  scarcely excited a murmur of disapprobation?  Are we still in those times,  when men and things were sacrificed to the caprices of favour? Are the  resources and the dignities of the State, still the exclusive patrimony of  a privileged class? and are there other titles to places and honours,  besides merit and talents?    Let us venture to advance another truth, a truth useful to the Minister  himself. There exists among the officers of the Marine, an intractable  _esprit de corps_, a pretended point of honour, equally false and arrogant,  which leads them to consider as an insult to the whole navy, the discovery  of one guilty individual. This inadmissible principle, which is useful only  to insignificance, to intrigue, to people the least worthy to call on the  name of honour, has the most ruinous consequences for the State, and the  public service. By this, incapacity and baseness are always covered with a  guilty veil, which they dare to attempt to render sacred; by this, the  favours of government are bestowed at random, upon persons, who impose upon  it the strange obligation of being perpetually in the dark respecting them.  Under the protection of this obligation of officious silence, hitherto  seconded by the slavery of the press, men without talents survive every  revolution, exhibit in every antichamber their privileged incapacity, and  braving public opinion, even that of their comrades, who are the first  victims of a foolish and arrogant prejudice, which deceives them, shew  themselves more eager to monopolise favours and honours, in proportion as  they are less able to render themselves worthy of them.    We shall believe that we have deserved well of our government, if our  faithful narrative can make it sensible how much its confidence is abused.  Just, besides, and not animated by passion, it is with real pleasure that  we shall make those known, who, by their conduct in our shipwreck, have  acquired a right to general esteem. Others will doubtless complain of the  severity of our accusing language; but honest men will grant us their  approbation. If we hear it said, that our frankness may have been useful to  our country, this success will be, at once, our justification and our  recompence.    We have questioned, concerning the nautical details, several gentlemen of  the navy who were on board; we confess, however, that on comparing their  accounts, we have observed that they did not always entirely agree; but we  have taken those facts which had the most witnesses in their favour. We  shall be sometimes obliged to record cruel truths; they will, however, be  directed only to those, whose unskilfulness, or pusillanimity have caused  these dreadful events. We venture to affirm, that the numerous  observations, which we have collected, will give to our work all the  accuracy rigorously required in so interesting a narrative.    We must observe to our readers that it has been impossible for us to avoid  the use of naval terms, which will, perhaps, give a great degree of  roughness to our narrative, but we hope that the public who are always  indulgent, will be so on this occasion, to two unfortunate men, who pretend  only to make them acquainted with the truth, and not to give them a  superior work. Besides, as we in a manner, submit these events, to the  judgment of the gentlemen of the French Navy, it was necessary to make use  of the technical terms, that they might be able to understand us.    This second edition is enriched with notes, which will give the reader  interesting details on many points, which in the former we could only  slightly touch upon. He will have nothing more to desire, particularly  respecting the march in the desert after the stranding of the long-boat.    These notes begin with the moment that the frigate stranded, and terminate  with the arrival at St. Louis.    They were communicated to us by Mr. Landry, an officer of the Royal  University, Professor Emeritus of the Academy of Paris, and at present at  the head of a school or Academy, in the Rue Cerisaye, No. 2, quarter of the  Arsenal, at Paris. He has had the kindness to extract them for us from a  narrative, written by his nephew, Mr. Bredif, Engineer of Mines, belonging  to the expedition to Senegal.    The Narrator sent this account to his family above a year ago, addressing  it to his sister. The reader will, therefore, not be surprised at the tone  of simplicity which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#1)"],[1,"By Sax Rohmer          PART FIRST--KAZMAH THE DREAM-READER        CHAPTER I. A MESSAGE FOR IRVIN    Monte Irvin, alderman of the city and prospective Lord Mayor of London,  paced restlessly from end to end of the well-appointed library of his  house in Prince's Gate. Between his teeth he gripped the stump of a  burnt-out cigar. A tiny spaniel lay beside the fire, his beady black  eyes following the nervous movements of the master of the house.    At the age of forty-five Monte Irvin was not ill-looking, and, indeed,  was sometimes spoken of as handsome. His figure was full without being  corpulent; his well-groomed black hair and moustache and fresh if rather  coarse complexion, together with the dignity of his upright carriage,  lent him something of a military air. This he assiduously cultivated as  befitting an ex-Territorial officer, although as he had seen no active  service he modestly refrained from using any title of rank.    Some quality in his brilliant smile, an oriental expressiveness of the  dark eyes beneath their drooping lids, hinted a Semitic strain; but  it was otherwise not marked in his appearance, which was free from  vulgarity, whilst essentially that of a successful man of affairs.    In fact, Monte Irvin had made a success of every affair in life with  the lamentable exception of his marriage. Of late his forehead had  grown lined, and those business friends who had known him for a man of  abstemious habits had observed in the City chophouse at which he lunched  almost daily that whereas formerly he had been a noted trencherman, he  now ate little but drank much.    Suddenly the spaniel leapt up with that feverish, spider-like activity  of the toy species and began to bark.    Monte Irvin paused in his restless patrol and listened.    \"Lie down!\" he said. \"Be quiet.\"    The spaniel ran to the door, sniffing eagerly. A muffled sound of voices  became audible, and Irvin, following a moment of hesitation, crossed  and opened the door. The dog ran out, yapping in his irritating staccato  fashion, and an expression of hope faded from Irvin's face as he saw a  tall fair girl standing in the hallway talking to Hinkes, the butler.  She wore soiled Burberry, high-legged tan boots, and a peaked cap of  distinctly military appearance. Irvin would have retired again, but  the girl glanced up and saw him where he stood by the library door. He  summoned up a smile and advanced.    \"Good evening, Miss Halley,\" he said, striving to speak genially--for of  all of his wife's friends he liked Margaret Halley the best. \"Were you  expecting to find Rita at home?\"    The girl's expression was vaguely troubled. She had the clear complexion  and bright eyes of perfect health, but to-night her eyes seemed  over-bright, whilst her face was slightly pale.    \"Yes,\" she replied; \"that is, I hoped she might be at home.\"    \"I am afraid I cannot tell you when she is likely to return. But please  come in, and I will make inquiries.\"    \"Oh, no, I would rather you did not trouble and I won't stay, thank you  nevertheless. I expect she will ring me up when she comes in.\"    \"Is there any message I can give her?\"    \"Well\"--she hesitated for an instant--\"you might tell her, if you would,  that I only returned home at eight o'clock, so that I could not come  around any earlier.\" She glanced rapidly at Irvin, biting her lip. \"I  wish I could have seen her,\" she added in a low voice.    \"She wishes to see you particularly?\"    \"Yes. She left a note this afternoon.\" Again she glanced at him in  a troubled way. \"Well, I suppose it cannot be helped,\" she added and  smilingly extended her hand. \"Good night, Mr. Irvin. Don't bother to  come to the door.\"    But Irvin passed Hinkes and walked out under the porch with Margaret  Halley. Humid yellow mist floated past the street lamps, and seemed to  have gathered in a moving reef around the little runabout car which was  standing outside the house, its motor chattering tremulously.    \"Phew! a beastly night!\" he said. \"Foggy and wet.\"    \"It's a brute isn't it?\" said the girl laughingly, and turned on the  steps so that the light shining out of the hallway gleamed on her white  teeth and upraised eyes. She was pulling on big, ugly, furred gloves,  and Monte Irvin mentally contrasted her fresh, athletic type of beauty  with the delicate, exotic charm of his wife.    She opened the door of the little car, got in and drove off, waving one  hugely gloved hand to Irvin as he stood in the porch looking after her.  When the red tail-light had vanished in the mist he returned to the  house and re-entered the library. If only all his wife's friends  were like Margaret Halley, he mused, he might have been spared the  insupportable misgivings which were goading him to madness. His mind  filled with poisonous suspicions, he resumed his pacing of the library,  awaiting and dreading that which should confirm his blackest theories.  He was unaware of the fact that throughout the interview he had held the  stump of cigar between his teeth. He held it there yet, pacing, pacing  up and down the long room.    Then came the expected summons. The telephone bell rang. Monte Irvin  clenched his hands and inhaled deeply. His color changed in a  manner that would have aroused a physician's interest. Regaining his  self-possession by a visible effort, he crossed to a small side-table  upon which the instrument rested. Rolling the cigar stump into the left  corner of his mouth, he took up the receiver.    \"Hallo!\" he said.    \"Someone named Brisley, sir, wishes--\"    \"Put him through to me here.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    A short interval, then:    \"Yes?\" said Monte Irvin.    \"My name is Brisley. I have a message for Mr. Monte Irvin.\"    \"Monte Irvin speaking. Anything to report, Brisley?\"    Irvin's deep, rich voice was not entirely under control.    \"Yes, sir. The lady drove by taxicab from Prince's Gate to Albemarle  Street.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Went up to chambers of Sir Lucien Pyne and was admitted.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Twenty minutes later came out. Lady was with Sir Lucien. Both walked  around to old Bond Street. The Honorable Quentin Gray--\"    \"Ah!\" breathed Irvin.    \"--Overtook them there. He got out of a cab. He joined them. All three  up to apartments of a professional crystal-gazer styling himself Kazmah  'the dream-reader.'\"    A puzzled expression began to steal over the face of Monte Irvin. At  the sound of the telephone bell he had paled somewhat. Now he began to  recover his habitual florid coloring.    \"Go on,\" he directed, for the speaker had paused.    \"Seven to ten minutes later,\" resumed the nasal voice, \"Mr. Gray came  down. He hailed a passing cab, but man refused to stop. Mr. Gray seemed  to be very irritable.\"    The fact that the invisible speaker was reading from a notebook he  betrayed by his monotonous intonation and abbreviated sentences, which  resembled those of a constable giving evidence in a police court.    \"He walked off rapidly in direction of Piccadilly. Colleague followed.  Near the Ritz he obtained a cab. He returned in same to old Bond Street.  He ran upstairs and was gone from four-and-a-half to five minutes. He  then came down again. He was very pale and agitated. He discharged cab  and walked away. Colleague followed. He saw Mr. Gray enter Prince's  Restaurant. In the hall Mr. Gray met a gent unknown by sight to  colleague. Following some conversation both gents went in to dinner.  They are there now. Speaking from Dover Street Tube.\"    \"Yes, yes. But the lady?\"    \"A native, possibly Egyptian, apparently servant of Kazmah, came out a  few minutes after Mr. Gray had gone for cab, and went away. Sir Lucien  Pyne and lady are still in Kazmah's rooms.\"    \"What!\" cried Irvin, pulling out his watch and glancing at the disk.  \"But it's after eight o'clock!\"    \"Yes, sir. The place is all shut up, and other offices in block closed  at six. Door of Kazmah's is locked. I knocked and got no reply.\"    \"Damn it! You're talking nonsense! There must be another exit.\"    \"No, sir. Colleague has just relieved me. Left two gents over their wine  at Prince's.\"    Monte Irvin's color began to fade slowly.    \"Then it's Pyne!\" he whispered. The hand which held the receiver shook.  \"Brisley--meet me at the Piccadilly end of Bond Street. I am coming  now.\"    He put down the telephone, crossed to the wall and pressed a button. The  cigar stump held firmly between his teeth, he stood on the rug before  the hearth, facing the door. Presently it opened and Hinkes came in.    \"The car is ready, Hinkes?\"    \"Yes, sir, as you ordered. Shall Pattison come round to the door?\"    \"At once.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    He withdrew, closing the door quietly, and Monte Irvin stood staring  across the library at the full-length portrait in oils of his wife in  the pierrot dress which she had worn in the third act of The Maid of the  Masque.    The clock in the hall struck half-past eight.        CHAPTER II. THE APARTMENTS OF KAZMAH    It was rather less than two hours earlier on the same evening that  Quentin Gray came out of the confectioner's shop in old Bond Street  carrying a neat parcel. Yellow dusk was closing down upon this bazaar  of the New Babylon, and many of the dealers in precious gems, vendors  of rich stuffs, and makers of modes had already deserted their shops.  Smartly dressed show-girls, saleswomen, girl clerks and others crowded  the pavements, which at high noon had been thronged with ladies of  fashion. Here a tailor's staff, there a hatter's lingered awhile as iron  shutters and gratings were secured, and bidding one another good night,  separated and made off towards Tube and bus. The working day was ended.  Society was dressing for dinner.    Gray was about to enter the cab which awaited him, and his  fresh-colored, boyish face wore an expression of eager expectancy,  which must have betrayed the fact to an experienced beholder that he was  hurrying to keep an agreeable"]]]
