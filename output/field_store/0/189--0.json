Hornsby [HW: (White)]  Athens    Edited by:  Sarah H. Hall  Athens    and  John N. Booth  District Supervisor  Federal Writers' Project  Residencies 6 & 7  Augusta, Georgia      Rachel Adams' two-room, frame house is perched on the side of a steep  hill where peach trees and bamboo form dense shade. Stalks of corn at  the rear of the dwelling reach almost to the roof ridge and a portion of  the front yard is enclosed for a chicken yard. Stepping gingerly around  the amazing number of nondescript articles scattered about the small  veranda, the visitor rapped several times on the front door, but  received no response. A neighbor said the old woman might be found at  her son's store, but she was finally located at the home of a daughter.    Rachel came to the front door with a sandwich of hoecake and cheese in  one hand and a glass of water in the other. \"Dis here's Rachel Adams,\"  she declared. \"Have a seat on de porch.\" Rachel is tall, thin, very  black, and wears glasses. Her faded pink outing wrapper was partly  covered by an apron made of a heavy meal sack. Tennis shoes, worn  without hose, and a man's black hat completed her outfit.    Rachel began her story by saying: \"Miss, dats been sich a long time back  dat I has most forgot how things went. Anyhow I was borned in Putman  County 'bout two miles from Eatonton, Georgia. My Ma and Pa was 'Melia  and Iaaac Little and, far as I knows, dey was borned and bred in dat  same county. Pa, he was sold away from Ma when I was still a baby. Ma's  job was to weave all de cloth for de white folks. I have wore many a  dress made out of de homespun what she wove. Dere was 17 of us chillun,  and I can't 'member de names of but two of 'em now--dey was John and  Sarah. John was Ma's onliest son; all de rest of de other 16 of us was  gals.    \"Us lived in mud-daubed log cabins what had old stack chimblies made out  of sticks and mud. Our old home-made beds didn't have no slats or metal  springs neither. Dey used stout cords for springs. De cloth what dey  made the ticks of dem old hay mattresses and pillows out of was so  coarse dat it scratched us little chillun most to death, it seemed lak  to us dem days. I kin still feel dem old hay mattresses under me now.  Evvy time I moved at night it sounded lak de wind blowin' through dem  peach trees and bamboos 'round de front of de house whar I lives now.    \"Grandma Anna was 115 years old when she died. She had done wore herself  out in slavery time. Grandpa, he was sold off somewhar. Both of 'em was  field hands.    \"Potlicker and cornbread was fed to us chillun, out of big old wooden  bowls. Two or three chillun et out of de same bowl. Grown folks had  meat, greens, syrup, cornbread, 'taters and de lak. 'Possums! I should  say so. Dey cotch plenty of 'em and atter dey was kilt ma would scald  'em and rub 'em in hot ashes and dat clean't 'em jus' as pretty and  white. OO-o-o but dey was good. Lord, Yessum! Dey used to go fishin' and  rabbit huntin' too. Us jus' fotched in game galore den, for it was de  style dem days. Dere warn't no market meat in slavery days. Seemed lak  to me in dem days dat ash-roasted 'taters and groundpeas was de best  somepin t'eat what anybody could want. 'Course dey had a gyarden, and it  had somepin of jus' about evvything what us knowed anything 'bout in de  way of gyarden sass growin' in it. All de cookin' was done in dem big  old open fireplaces what was fixed up special for de pots and ovens.  Ashcake was most as good as 'taters cooked in de ashes, but not quite.    \"Summertime, us jus' wore homespun dresses made lak de slips dey use for  underwear now. De coats what us wore over our wool dresses in winter was  knowed as 'sacques' den, 'cause dey was so loose fittin'. Dey was heavy  and had wool in 'em too. Marse Lewis, he had a plenty of sheep, 'cause  dey was bound to have lots of warm winter clothes, and den too, dey  lakked mutton to eat. Oh! dem old brogan shoes was coarse and rough.  When Marse Lewis had a cow kilt dey put de hide in de tannin' vat. When  de hides was ready, Uncle Ben made up de shoes, and sometimes dey let  Uncle Jasper holp him if dere was many to be made all at one time. Us  wore de same sort of clothes on Sunday as evvyday, only dey had to be  clean and fresh when dey was put on Sunday mornin'.    \"Marse Lewis Little and his wife, Miss Sallie, owned us, and Old Miss,  she died long 'fore de surrender. Marse Lewis, he was right good to all  his slaves; but dat overseer, he would beat us down in a minute if us  didn't do to suit him. When dey give slaves tasks to do and dey warn't  done in a certain time, dat old overseer would whup 'em 'bout dat.  Marster never had to take none of his Niggers to court or put 'em in  jails neither; him and de overseer sot 'em right. Long as Miss Sallie  lived de carriage driver driv her and Marse Lewis around lots, but atter  she died dere warn't so much use of de carriage. He jus' driv for Marse  Lewis and piddled 'round de yard den.    \"Some slaves larnt to read and write. If dey went to meetin' dey had to  go wid deir white folks 'cause dey didn't have no sep'rate churches for  de Niggers 'til atter de war. On our Marster's place, slaves didn't go  off to meetin' a t'all. Dey jus' went 'round to one another's houses and  sung songs. Some of 'em read de Bible by heart. Once I heared a man  preach what didn't know how to read one word in de Bible, and he didn't  even have no Bible yit.    \"De fust baptizin' I ever seed was atter I was nigh 'bout grown. If a  slave from our place ever jined up wid a church 'fore de war was over, I  never heared tell nothin' 'bout it.    \"Lordy, Miss! I didn't know nothin' 'bout what a funeral was dem days.  If a Nigger died dis mornin', dey sho' didn't waste no time a-puttin'  him right on down in de ground dat same day. Dem coffins never had no  shape to 'em; dey was jus' squar-aidged pine boxes. Now warn't dat  turrible?    \"Slaves never went nowhar widout dem patterollers beatin' 'em up if dey  didn't have no pass.    \"Dere was hunderds of acres in dat dere plantation. Marse Lewis had a  heap of slaves. De overseer, he had a bugle what he blowed to wake up  de slaves. He blowed it long 'fore day so dat dey could eat breakfast  and be out dere in de fields waitin' for de sun to rise so dey could see  how to wuk, and dey stayed out dar and wukked 'til black dark. When a  rainy spell come and de grass got to growin' fast, dey wukked dem slaves  at night, even when de moon warn't shinin'. On dem dark nights one set  of slaves helt lanterns for de others to see how to chop de weeds out of  de cotton and corn. Wuk was sho' tight dem days. Evvy slave had a task  to do atter dey got back to dem cabins at night. Dey each one hed to  spin deir stint same as de 'omans, evvy night.    \"Young and old washed deir clothes Sadday nights. Dey hardly knowed what  Sunday was. Dey didn't have but one day in de Christmas, and de only  diff'unce dey seed dat day was dat dey give 'em some biscuits on  Christmas day. New Year's Day was rail-splittin' day. Dey was told how  many rails was to be cut, and dem Niggers better split dat many or  somebody was gwine to git beat up.    \"I don't 'member much 'bout what us played, 'cept de way us run 'round  in a ring. Us chillun was allus skeered to play in de thicket nigh de  house 'cause Raw Head and Bloody Bones lived der. Dey used to skeer us  out 'bout red 'taters.

If you'll  consent to finance this expedition to the extent of, say, ten thousand  dollars, I'll practically guarantee to give you back five times that  sum.\"    \"I don't know, Alec, I don't know,\" slowly responded the aged inventor.  \"I've heard those stories before, and in my experience nothing ever  came of them. Buried treasure, and lost vessels filled with gold, are  all well and good, but hunting for an opal mine on some little-heard-of  island goes them one better.\"    \"Then you don't feel like backing me up in this matter, Mr. Swift?\"    \"No, Alec, I can't say I do. Why, just stop and think for a minute.  You're asking me to put ten thousand dollars into a company, to fit out  an expedition to go to this island--somewhere down near Panama, you say  it is--and try to locate the lost mine from which, some centuries ago,  opals and other precious stones came. It doesn't seem reasonable.\"    \"But I'm sure I can find the mine, Mr. Swift!\" persisted Alec Peterson,  who was almost as elderly a man as the one he addressed. \"I have the  old documents that tell how rich the mine once was, how the old Mexican  rulers used to get their opals from it, and how all trace of it was  lost in the last century. I have all the landmarks down pat, and I'm  sure I can find it. Come on now, take a chance. Put in this ten  thousand dollars. I can manage the rest. You'll get back more than five  times your investment.\"    \"If you find the mine--yes.\"    \"I tell you I will find it! Come now, Mr. Swift,\" and the visitor's  voice was very pleading, \"you and your son Tom have made a fortune for  yourselves out of your different inventions.  Be generous, and lend me  this ten thousand dollars.\"    Mr. Swift shook his head.    \"I've heard you talk the same way before, Alec,\" he replied.  \"None of  your schemes ever amounted to anything. You've been a fortune-hunter  all your life, nearly; and what have you gotten out of it? Just a bare  living.\"    \"That's right, Mr. Swift, but I've had bad luck. I did find the lost  gold mine I went after some years ago, you remember.\"    \"Yes, only to lose it because the missing heirs turned up, and took it  away from you. You could have made more at straight mining in the time  you spent on that scheme.\"    \"Yes, I suppose I could; but this is going to be a success--I feel it  in my bones.\"    \"That's what you say, every time, Alec. No, I don't believe I want to  go into this thing.\"    \"Oh, come--do! For the sake of old times. Don't you recall how you and  I used to prospect together out in the gold country; how we shared our  failures and successes?\"    \"Yes, I remember that, Alec. Mighty few successes we had, though, in  those days.\"    \"But now you've struck it rich, pardner,\" went on the pleader.  \"Help  me out in this scheme--do!\"    \"No, Alec. I'd rather give you three or four thousand dollars for  yourself, if you'd settle down to some steady work, instead of chasing  all over the country after visionary fortunes. You're getting too old  to do that.\"    \"Well, it's a fact I'm no longer young. But I'm afraid I'm too old to  settle down. You can't teach an old dog new tricks, pardner. This is my  life, and I'll have to live it until I pass out. Well, if you won't,  you won't, I suppose. By the way, where is Tom? I'd like to see him  before I go back. He's a mighty fine boy.\"    \"That's what he is!\" broke in a new voice. \"Bless my overshoes, but he  is a smart lad! A wonderful lad, that's what! Why, bless my necktie,  there isn't anything he can't invent; from a button-hook to a  battleship! Wonderful boy--that's what!\"    \"I guess Tom's ears would burn if he could hear your praises, Mr.  Damon,\" laughed Mr. Swift. \"Don't spoil him.\"    \"Spoil Tom Swift? You couldn't do it in a hundred years!\" cried Mr.  Damon, enthusiastically. \"Bless my topknot! Not in a thousand  years--no, sir!\"    \"But where is he?\" asked Mr. Peterson, who was evidently unused to the  extravagant manner of Mr. Damon.    \"There he goes now!\" exclaimed the gentleman who frequently blessed  himself, some article of his apparel, or some other object. \"There he  goes now, flying over the house in that Humming Bird airship of his. He  said he was going to try out a new magneto he'd invented, and it seems  to be working all right. He said he wasn't going to take much of a  flight, and I guess he'll soon be back. Look at him! Isn't he a great  one, though!\"    \"He certainly is,\" agreed Mr. Peterson, as he and Mr. Swift went to the  window, from which Mr. Damon had caught a glimpse of the youthful  Inventor in his airship. \"A great lad. I wish he could come on this  mine-hunt with me, though I'd never consent to go in an airship.  They're too risky for an old man like me.\"    \"They're as safe as a church when Tom Swift runs them!\" declared Mr.  Damon. \"I'm no boy, but I'd go anywhere with Tom.\"    \"I'm afraid you wouldn't get Tom to go with you, Alec,\" went on Mr.  Swift, as he resumed his chair, the young inventor in his airship  having passed out of sight. \"He's busy on some new invention now, I  believe. I think I heard him say something about a new rifle.\"    \"Cannon it was, Mr. Swift,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Tom has an idea that he  can make the biggest cannon in the world; but it's only an idea yet.\"    \"Well, then I guess there's no hope of my interesting him in my opal  mine,\" said the fortune-hunter, with rather a disappointed smile. \"Nor  you either, Mr. Swift.\"    \"No, Alec, I'm afraid not. As I said, I'd rather give you outright  three or four thousand dollars, if you wanted it, provided that you  used it for your own personal needs, and promised not to sink it in  some visionary search.\"    Mr. Peterson shook his head.    \"I'm not actually in want,\" he said, \"and I couldn't accept a gift of  money, Mr. Swift. This is a straight business proposition.\"    \"Not much straight business in hunting for a mine that's been lost for  over a century,\" replied the aged inventor, with a glance at Mr. Damon,  who was still at the window, watching for a glimpse of Tom on his  return trip in the air craft.    \"If Tom would go, I'd trail along,\" said the odd man. \"We haven't done  anything worth speaking of since he used his great searchlight to  detect the smugglers. But I don't believe he'll go. That mining  proposition sounds good.\"    \"It is good!\" cried Mr. Peterson, with fervor, hoping he had found a  new \"prospect\" in Mr. Damon.    \"But not business-good,\" declared Mr. Swift, and for some time the  three argued the matter, Mr. Swift continuing to shake his head.    Suddenly into the room there ran an aged colored man, much excited.    \"Fo' de land sakes!\" he cried. \"Somebody oughter go out an' help Massa  Tom!\"    \"Why, what's the matter, Eradicate?\" asked Mr. Swift, leaping to his  feet, an example followed by the other two men. \"What has happened to  my son?\"    \"I dunno, Massa Swift, but I looked up jest now, an' dere he be, in dat  air-contraption ob his'n he calls de Hummin' Burd.  He's ketched up  fast on de balloon shed roof, an' dere he's hangin' wif sparks an'  flames a-shootin' outer de airship suffin' scandalous! It's jest  spittin' fire, dat's what it's a-doin', an' ef somebody don't do  suffin' fo' Massa Tom mighty quick, dere ain't gwin t' be any Massa  Tom; now dat's what I'se a-tellin' you!\"    \"Bless my shoe buttons!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Come on out, everybody!  We've got to help Tom!\"    \"Yes!\" assented Mr. Swift. \"Call someone on the telephone! Get a  doctor! Maybe he's shocked! Where's Koku, the giant? Maybe he can help!\"    \"Now doan't yo' go t' gittin' all excited-laik,\" objected Eradicate  Sampson, the aged colored man. \"Remember yo' all has got a weak heart,  Massa Swift!\"    \"I know it; but I must save my son. Hurry!\"    Mr. Swift ran from the room, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Peterson,  while Eradicate trailed after them as fast as his tottering limbs would  carry him, murmuring to himself.    \"There he is!\" cried Mr. Damon, as he caught sight of the young  inventor in his airship, in a position of peril. Truly it was as  Eradicate had said. Caught on the slope of the roof of his big balloon  shed, Tom Swift was in great danger.    From his airship there shot dazzling sparks, and streamers of green and  violet fire. There was a snapping, cracking sound that could be heard  above the whir of the craft's propellers, for the motor was still  running.    \"Oh, Tom! Tom! What is it? What has happened?\" cried his father.    \"Keep back! Don't come too close!\" yelled the young inventor, as he  clung to the seat of the aeroplane, that was tilted at a dangerous  angle. \"Keep away!\"    \"What's the matter?\" demanded Mr. Damon. \"Bless my pocket comb--what is  it?\"    \"A live wire!\" answered Tom. \"I'm caught in a live wire! The trailer  attached to the wireless outfit on my airship is crossed with the wire  from the power plant. There's a short circuit somewhere. Don't come too  close, for it may burn"]]]
