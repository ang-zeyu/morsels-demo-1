Purple haze  began to thicken in the timbered notches. Gray foothills, round and  billowy, rolled down from the higher country. They were smooth,  sweeping, with long velvety slopes and isolated patches of aspens that  blazed in autumn gold. Splotches of red vine colored the soft gray of  sage. Old White Slides, a mountain scarred by avalanche, towered with  bleak rocky peak above the valley, sheltering it from the north.    A girl rode along the slope, with gaze on the sweep and range and color  of the mountain fastness that was her home. She followed an old trail  which led to a bluff overlooking an arm of the valley. Once it had been  a familiar lookout for her, but she had not visited the place of late.  It was associated with serious hours of her life. Here seven years  before, when she was twelve, she had made a hard choice to please her  guardian--the old rancher whom she loved and called father, who had  indeed been a father to her. That choice had been to go to school in  Denver. Four years she had lived away from her beloved gray hills and  black mountains. Only once since her return had she climbed to this  height, and that occasion, too, was memorable as an unhappy hour. It  had been three years ago. To-day girlish ordeals and griefs seemed back  in the past: she was a woman at nineteen and face to face with the first  great problem in her life.    The trail came up back of the bluff, through a clump of aspens with  white trunks and yellow fluttering leaves, and led across a level bench  of luxuriant grass and wild flowers to the rocky edge.    She dismounted and threw the bridle. Her mustang, used to being petted,  rubbed his sleek, dark head against her and evidently expected like  demonstration in return, but as none was forthcoming he bent his nose to  the grass and began grazing. The girl's eyes were intent upon some  waving, slender, white-and-blue flowers. They smiled up wanly, like pale  stars, out of the long grass that had a tinge of gold.    \"Columbines,\" she mused, wistfully, as she plucked several of the  flowers and held them up to gaze wonderingly at them, as if to see in  them some revelation of the mystery that shrouded her birth and her  name. Then she stood with dreamy gaze upon the distant ranges.    \"Columbine!... So they named me--those miners who found me--a baby--lost  in the woods--asleep among the columbines.\" She spoke aloud, as if the  sound of her voice might convince her.    So much of the mystery of her had been revealed that day by the man she  had always called father. Vaguely she had always been conscious of some  mystery, something strange about her childhood, some relation never  explained.    \"No name but Columbine,\" she whispered, sadly, and now she understood a  strange longing of her heart.    Scarcely an hour back, as she ran down the Wide porch of White Slides  ranch-house, she had encountered the man who had taken care of her all  her life. He had looked upon her as kindly and fatherly as of old, yet  with a difference. She seemed to see him as old Bill Belllounds, pioneer  and rancher, of huge frame and broad face, hard and scarred and  grizzled, with big eyes of blue fire.    \"Collie,\" the old man had said, \"I reckon hyar's news. A letter from  Jack.... He's comin' home.\"    Belllounds had waved the letter. His huge hand trembled as he reached to  put it on her shoulder. The hardness of him seemed strangely softened.  Jack was his son. Buster Jack, the range had always called him, with  other terms, less kind, that never got to the ears of his father. Jack  had been sent away three years ago, just before Columbine's return from  school. Therefore she had not seen him for over seven years. But she  remembered him well--a big, rangy boy, handsome and wild, who had made  her childhood almost unendurable.    \"Yes--my son--Jack--he's comin' home,\" said Belllounds, with a break in  his voice. \"An', Collie--now I must tell you somethin'.\"    \"Yes, dad,\" she had replied, with strong clasp of the heavy hand on her  shoulder.    \"Thet's just it, lass. I ain't your dad. I've tried to be a dad to you  an' I've loved you as my own. But you're not flesh an' blood of mine.  An' now I must tell you.\"    The brief story followed. Seventeen years ago miners working a claim of  Belllounds's in the mountains above Middle Park had found a child asleep  in the columbines along the trail. Near that point Indians, probably  Arapahoes coming across the mountains to attack the Utes, had captured  or killed the occupants of a prairie-schooner. There was no other clue.  The miners took the child to their camp, fed and cared for it, and,  after the manner of their kind, named it Columbine. Then they brought it  to Belllounds.    \"Collie,\" said the old rancher, \"it needn't never have been told, an'  wouldn't but fer one reason. I'm gettin' old. I reckon I'd never split  my property between you an' Jack. So I mean you an' him to marry. You  always steadied Jack. With a wife like you'll be--wal, mebbe Jack'll--\"    \"Dad!\" burst out Columbine. \"Marry Jack!... Why I--I don't even remember  him!\"    \"Haw! Haw!\" laughed Belllounds. \"Wal, you dog-gone soon will. Jack's in  Kremmlin', an' he'll be hyar to-night or to-morrow.\"    \"But--I--I don't l-love him,\" faltered Columbine.    The old man lost his mirth; the strong-lined face resumed its hard cast;  the big eyes smoldered. Her appealing objection had wounded him. She was  reminded of how sensitive the old man had always been to any reflection  cast upon his son.    \"Wal, thet's onlucky;\" he replied, gruffly. \"Mebbe you'll change. I  reckon no girl could help a boy much, onless she cared for him. Anyway,  you an' Jack will marry.\"    He had stalked away and Columbine had ridden her mustang far up the  valley slope where she could be alone. Standing on the verge of the  bluff, she suddenly became aware that the quiet and solitude of her  lonely resting-place had been disrupted. Cattle were bawling below her  and along the slope of old White Slides and on the grassy uplands above.  She had forgotten that the cattle were being driven down into the  lowlands for the fall round-up. A great red-and-white-spotted herd was  milling in the park just beneath her. Calves and yearlings were making  the dust fly along the mountain slope; wild old steers were crashing in  the sage, holding level, unwilling to be driven down; cows were running  and lowing for their lost ones. Melodious and clear rose the clarion  calls of the cowboys. The cattle knew those calls and only the wild  steers kept up-grade.    Columbine also knew each call and to which cowboy it belonged. They sang  and yelled and swore, but it was all music to her. Here and there along  the slope, where the aspen groves clustered, a horse would flash across  an open space; the dust would fly, and a cowboy would peal out a lusty  yell that rang along the slope and echoed under the bluff and lingered  long after the daring rider had vanished in the steep thickets.    \"I wonder which is Wils,\" murmured Columbine, as she watched and  listened, vaguely conscious of a little difference, a strange check in  her remembrance of this particular cowboy. She felt the change, yet did  not understand. One after one she recognized the riders on the slopes  below, but Wilson Moore was not among them. He must be above her, then,  and she turned to gaze across the grassy bluff, up the long, yellow  slope, to where the gleaming aspens half hid a red bluff of  mountain, towering aloft. Then from far to her left, high up a  scrubby ridge of the slope, rang down a voice that thrilled her:  \"_Go--aloong--you-ooooo_.\" Red cattle dashed pell-mell down the slope,  raising the dust, tearing the brush, rolling rocks, and letting out  hoarse bawls.    \"_Whoop-ee_!\" High-pitched and pealing came a clearer yell.    Columbine saw a white mustang flash out on top of the ridge, silhouetted  against the blue, with mane and tail flying. His gait on that edge of  steep slope proved his rider to be a reckless cowboy for whom no heights  or depths had terrors. She would have recognized him from the way he  rode, if she had not known the slim, erect figure. The cowboy saw her  instantly. He pulled the mustang, about to plunge down the slope, and  lifted him, rearing and wheeling. Then Columbine waved her hand. The  cowboy spurred his horse along the crest of the ridge, disappeared  behind the grove of aspens, and came in sight again around to the right,  where on the grassy bench he slowed to a walk in descent to the bluff.    The girl watched him come, conscious of an unfamiliar sense of  uncertainty in this meeting, and of the fact that she was seeing him  differently from any other time in the years he had been a playmate, a  friend, almost like a brother. He had ridden for Belllounds for years,  and was a cowboy because he loved cattle well and horses better,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#1)"],[1,"DIVINE RIGHT    OF    CHURCH GOVERNMENT:    WHEREIN IT IS PROVED    THAT THE PRESBYTERIAN GOVERNMENT, BY PREACHING AND RULING ELDERS, IN  SESSIONAL, PRESBYTERIAL, AND SYNODICAL ASSEMBLIES, MAY LAY THE ONLY  LAWFUL CLAIM TO A DIVINE RIGHT, ACCORDING TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.

THE EDITOR TO THE READER.           *       *       *       *       *    After what the authors of the following Treatise have said in their  preface, the Editor judges it unnecessary for him to detain the reader  long with any observations of his upon the subject. He, however, could  sincerely wish that the friends of Christ would pay that attention to  the government and discipline of his Church which it justly deserves.  Although this subject should not be placed among the things essential to  the being of a Christian; yet if it be found among the things that  Christ has commanded, it is at our peril if we continue wilfully  ignorant of, or despise it. He has expressly declared, that he who  breaks one of the _least_ of his commandments, and teacheth men to do  so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. It is an opinion too  common, that if we believe the _essentials_ of religion, there is no  occasion for so much preciseness about the forms of church government,  which are only _circumstantials_, as there will be no inquiry made about  these at the tribunal of Christ. But whatever relative importance the  things of religion may have, when compared with one another, we ought to  reckon nothing which God hath appointed, nothing which Jesus hath  ratified with his blood, nothing which the Holy Spirit hath indited, so  _circumstantial_, as to be unworthy of our serious regard. It is at  least very rash, if not presumptuous, to say, that nothing about the  circumstantials of religion will be inquired into at the tribunal of  Christ. God has expressly said, that every work, good or evil, every  idle word, and every deed done in the body, shall be brought into  judgment; and false worshippers will, perhaps, find that their form of  worship consisted in something worse than idle words, or sinful words  either, even in sinful deeds, for which they will be accountable at the  judgment. As Christ laid down his life for his people, has instructed  them, and has set a hedge about all that they have, it would be most  ungrateful to requite him with pouring the highest contempt on his  kingly honor and authority; and when his worship is polluted, his truth  perverted, and the walls of his New Testament Zion broken down, to care  for none of those things. Government and discipline are the hedge of his  garden, the Church; and how will what men call the essentials of  religion remain in their glory, when this is broken down, the present  state of affairs can sufficiently attest, when the most damnable errors  are propagated with impunity.    In our times the enemies of the scriptural order of the house of God are  very numerous and very active, exerting all their power to break down  the carved work of God's sanctuary. The present spirit for novelty and  innovation, together with the rage for infidelity so prevalent, strongly  favors the opposition made to every thing which has a tendency to bind  men closely to God, to his truths, to the purity of his worship and  ordinances, or to one another by a holy profession. The design,  therefore, of republishing this Treatise is to assist Presbyterians of  all denominations in the understanding of those passages of Scripture  upon which their wall is built, that they be not led aside by the  cunning speeches of false teachers, whereby they deceive and draw aside  the hearts of the simple.    This work was first published at London, at the time when the  controversy between the Presbyterians and ancient Independents ran very  high, and every intelligent and unprejudiced reader will see, that the  Holy Scriptures have been carefully perused, accurately compared, wisely  collected, and judiciously explained, in order to evince that the  Presbyterian government has the only lawful claim to a divine right, and  is the only form appointed by Christ in his Church. It is, therefore, to  be wished, that all his people would endeavor, in the strength of Divine  grace, to observe the laws of his house, and to walk in all his  ordinances and commandments blameless.    Considerable pains have been taken to make this edition more easily  understood by common readers than the former, and yet several difficult  and hard words have passed unnoticed. The Latin quotations from the  Fathers have been omitted, because they contain nothing materially  different from what is in the body of the work, and modern Independents  pay little regard to any human authorities but their own. It was  proposed to have added a few extracts from Messrs. Rutherford and  Gillespie, but upon looking into their works nothing of consequence was  observed, that tended to cast any new light upon the subject. It is  hoped, however, that the Appendix is filled up with extracts from other  authors upon subjects of considerable importance, and very necessary for  these times, concerning the scriptural qualifications and duties of  church members; the divine right of the gospel ministry; the people's  divine right to choose their own pastors; with an abstract of Dr. Owen's  arguments in favor of the divine right of the ruling elder: and as there  are many serious Christians who have not a capacity to take up and  retain a long chain of reasoning, a summary of the whole Treatise is  given by way of question and answer as a conclusion.    The Editor is not to be understood as approving of, or vindicating every  single sentiment, or mode of expression, used in this Treatise: at the  same time, next to the Holy Scriptures, he recommends it as one of the  best defences of presbytery which he has seen.    That it may be blessed of God for informing the ignorant, settling the  wavering, and establishing the believers of _the present Truth_, is the  earnest desire of,    Christian reader,    Your humble servant in the Gospel,    T.H.    _Paisley, 28th February, 1799._          PREFACE    TO THE PIOUS AND JUDICIOUS READER.      CHRISTIAN READER:    Thou hast in the ensuing treatise, 1st, a brief delineation of the  nature of a divine right, wherein it consists, and how many ways a thing  may be accounted of divine right, according to the Scriptures; as also,  2d, a plain and familiar description of that church government which  seems to have the clearest divine right for it, and (of all other  contended for) to be the most consonant and agreeable to the word of  Christ; which description (comprehending in itself the whole frame and  system of the government) is in the several branches thereof explained  and confirmed by testimonies or arguments from Scripture; more briefly,  in particulars which are easily granted; more largely, in particulars  which are commonly controverted; yet as perspicuously and concisely in  both as the nature of this unusual and comprehensive subject insisted  upon would permit. Things are handled rather by way of positive  assertion, than of polemical dissertation, (which too commonly  degenerates into verbal strifes, 1 Tim. vi. 3, 4; 2 Tim. ii. 23; and  vain-jangling, 1 Tim. i. 6,) and where any dissenting opinions or  objections are refuted, we hope it is with that sobriety, meekness, and  moderation of spirit, that any unprejudiced judgment may perceive, that  we had rather gain than grieve those who dissent from us; that we  endeavor rather to heal up than to tear open the rent; and that we  contend more for truth than for victory.    To the publication hereof we have been inclinable (after much  importunity) principally upon deliberate and serious consideration of,  1st, the necessity of a treatise of this kind; 2d, the advantage likely  to accrue thereupon; and, 3d, the seasonable opportunity of sending it  abroad at such a time as this is.    I. The necessity of a treatise of this nature, is evident and urgent.  For,    1. We hold ourselves obliged, not only by the common duty of our  ministerial calling, but also by the special bond of our solemn  covenant with God, especially in Art. 1, to bend all our best endeavors  to help forward a reformation of religion according to the word of God,  which can never be effected without a due establishment of the  scripture-government and discipline in the Church of God. And to make  known what this government is from the law and testimony, by preaching  or writing, comes properly and peculiarly within the sphere of our place  and vocation.    2. A cloud of darkness and prejudice, in reference to this matter of  church government, too generally rests upon the judgments and  apprehensions of men (yea of God's own people) among us, either, 1st,  through the difficulty or uncommonness of this matter of church  government, (though ancient and familiar in other reformed churches, yet  new and strange to us;) or, 2d, through the strange misrepresentations  that are made hereof, by those that are small friends to the true  presbyterial government, or that are"]]]
