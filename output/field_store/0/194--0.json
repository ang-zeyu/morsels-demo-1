It can't be as much as that!\"    \"Well, you can prove the additions yourself, Tom, on one of the adding  machines. I've been over 'em twice, and get the same result each time.  There are the figures. They say figures don't lie, though it doesn't  follow that the opposite is true, for those who do not stick closely to  the truth do, sometimes, figure. But there you have it; your financial  statement for the year,\" and Ned Newton, business manager for Tom  Swift, the talented young inventor, shoved a mass of papers across the  table to his friend and chum, as well as employer.    \"It doesn't seem possible, Ned, that we have made as much as that this  past year. And this, as I understand it, doesn't include what was taken  from the wreck of the Pandora?\"    Tom Swift looked questioningly at Ned Newton, who shook his head in  answer.    \"You really didn't get anything to speak of out of your undersea  search, Tom,\" replied the young financial manager, \"so I didn't include  it. But there's enough without that.\"    \"I should say so!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Whew!\" he whistled, \"I didn't think  I was worth that much.\"    \"Well, you've earned it, every cent, with the inventions of yourself  and your father.\"    \"And I might add that we wouldn't have half we earn if it wasn't for  the shrewd way you look after us, Ned,\" said Tom, with a warm smile at  his friend. \"I appreciate the way you manage our affairs; for, though I  have had some pretty good luck with my searchlight, wizard camera, war  tank and other contraptions, I never would have been able to save any  of the money they brought in if it hadn't been for you.\"    \"Well, that's what I'm here for,\" remarked Ned modestly.    \"I appreciate that,\" began Tom Swift. \"And I want to say, Ned--\"    But Tom did not say what he had started to. He broke off suddenly, and  seemed to be listening to some sound outside the room of his home where  he and his financial and business manager were going over the year's  statement and accounting.    Ned, too, in spite of the fact that he had been busy going over  figures, adding up long columns, checking statements, and giving the  results to Tom, had been aware, in the last five minutes, of an  ever-growing tumult in the street. At first it had been no more than  the passage along the thoroughfare of an unusual number of pedestrians.  Ned had accounted for it at first by the theory that some moving  picture theater had finished the first performance and the people were  hurrying home.    But after he had finished his financial labors and had handed Tom the  first of a series of statements to look over, the young financial  expert began to realize that there was no moving picture house near  Tom's home. Consequently the passing throngs could not be accounted for  in that way.    Yet the tumult of feet grew in the highway outside. Ned had begun to  wonder if there had been an attempted burglary, a fight, or something  like that, calling for police action, which had gathered an unusual  throng that warm, spring evening.    And then had come Tom's interruption of himself when he broke off in  the middle of a sentence to listen intently.    \"What is it?\" asked Ned.    \"I thought I heard Rad or Koku moving around out there,\" murmured Tom.  \"It may be that my father is not feeling well and wants to speak to me  or that some one may have telephoned. I told them not to disturb me  while you and I were going over the accounts. But if it is something of  importance--\"    Again Tom paused, for distinctly now in addition to the ever-increasing  sounds in the streets could be heard a shuffling and talking in the  hall just outside the door.    \"G'wan 'way from heah now!\" cried the voice of a colored man.    \"It is Rad!\" exclaimed Tom, meaning thereby Eradicate Sampson, an aged  but faithful colored servant. And then the voice of Rad, as he was most  often called, went on with:    \"G'wan 'way! I'll tell Massa Tom!\"    \"Me tell! Big thing! Best for big man tell!\" broke in another voice; a  deep, booming voice that could only proceed from a powerfully built man.    \"Koku!\" exclaimed Tom, with a half comical look at Ned. \"He and Rad are  at it again!\"    Koku was a giant, literally, and he had attached himself to Tom when  the latter had made one of many perilous trips. So eager were Eradicate  and Koku to serve the young inventor that frequently there were more or  less good-natured clashes between them to see who would have the honor.    The discussion and scuffle in the hall at length grew so insistent that  Tom, fearing the aged colored man might accidentally be hurt by the  giant Koku, opened the door. There stood the two, each endeavoring to  push away the other that the victor might, it appeared, knock on the  door. Of course Rad was no match for Koku, but the giant, mindful of  his great strength, was not using all of it.    \"Here! what does this mean?\" cried Tom, rather more sternly than he  really meant. He had to pretend to be stern at times with his old  colored helper and the impulsive and powerful giant.  \"What are you  cutting up for outside my door when I told you I must be quiet with Mr.  Newton?\"    \"No can be quiet!\" declared the giant. \"Too much noise in street--big  crowds--much big!\"    He spoke an English of his own, did Koku.    \"What are the crowds doing?\" asked Ned. \"I thought we'd been hearing an  ever increasing tumult, Tom,\" he said to the young inventor.    \"Big crowds--'um go to see big--\"    \"Heah! Let me tell Massa Tom!\" pleaded Rad. Poor Rad! He was getting  old and could not perform the services that once he had so readily and  efficiently done. Now he was eager to help Tom in such small measure as  carrying him a message. So it was with a feeling of sadness that Tom  heard the old man say again, pleadingly:    \"Let me tell him, Koku! I know all 'bout it! Let me tell Massa Tom whut  it am, an'--\"    \"Well, go ahead and tell me!\" burst out Tom, with a good-natured laugh.  \"Don't keep me in suspense. If there's anything going on--\"    He did not finish the sentence. It was evident that something of moment  was going on, for the crowds in the street were now running instead of  walking, and voices could be heard calling back and forth such  exclamations as:    \"Where is it?\"    \"Must be a big one.\"    \"And with this wind it'll be worse!\"    Tom glanced at Ned and then at the two servants.    \"Has anything happened?\" asked the young inventor.    \"Dey's a big fire, Massa Tom!\" exploded Rad.    \"Heap big blaze!\" added Koku.    At the same time, out in the street high and clear, the cry rang out:    \"Fire! Fire!\"    \"Is it any of our buildings?\" exclaimed Tom, in his excitement catching  hold of the giant's arm.    \"No, it's quite a way off, on de odder side of town,\" answered the  colored man. \"But we t'ought we'd better come an' tell yo', an'--\"    \"Yes! Yes! I'm glad you did, Rad. It was perfectly right for you to  tell me! I wish you'd done it sooner, though! Come on, Ned! Let's go to  the blaze! We can finish looking over the figures another time. Is my  father all right, Rad?\"    \"Yes, suh, Massa Tom, he's done sleepin' good.\"    \"Then don't disturb him. Mr. Newton and I will go to the fire.  I'm  glad it isn't here,\" and Tom looked from a side window out on many  shops that were not a great distance from the house; shops where he and  his father had perfected many inventions.    The buildings had grown up around the old Swift homestead, which, now  that so much industry surrounded it, was not the most pleasant place to  live in. Tom and his father only made this their stopping place in  winter. In the summer they dwelt in a quiet cottage far removed from  the scenes of their industry.    \"We'll take the electric runabout, Ned,\" remarked Tom, as he caught up  a hat from the rack, an example followed by his friend.  Together the  young inventor and the financial manager hurried out to the garage,  where Tom soon had in operation a small electric automobile, that, more  than once, had proved its claim to being the \"speediest car on the  road.\"    As they turned out of the driveway into the street they became aware of  great crowds making their way toward a glow of sinister red light  showing in the eastern sky.    \"Some blaze!\" exclaimed Tom, as he turned on more power.    \"You said it!\" ejaculated Ned. \"Must be a general alarm,\" he added, as  they caught the sound from the next street of additional apparatus  hurrying to the fire.    \"Well, I'm glad it isn't on our side of town,\" remarked Tom, as he  looked back at the peaceful gloom surrounding and covering his own home  and work buildings.    \"Where do you reckon it is?\" asked Ned, as they sped onward.    \"Hard to say,\" remarked the young inventor, as he steered to one side  to pass a powerful imported automobile which, however, did not have the  speed of the electric runabout. \"A fire at night is always deceiving as  to direction. But we can locate it when we get to the top of the hill.\"    Shopton, the suburb of the town where Tom lived, was named so because  of the many shops that had been erected by the industry of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team.
