The location of Venice upon a group of islands, sufficiently removed  from the mainland to make it impossible to effectually attack it from  this side, and naturally defended on the side towards the sea by a  long chain of low islands, separated by shallow inlets and winding  channels, making it difficult to approach, has rendered the city  peculiarly free from the disturbing influences which were constantly  at work in the neighboring cities of Italy during the Middle Ages.  While her neighbors were building strong encircling walls, each  individual house a fortress in itself, Venice rested secure in her  natural defences and built her palaces open down to the water's  edge, with no attempt at fortification. Her hardy and adventurous  inhabitants rapidly extended their trade to all quarters of the world  and accumulated vast wealth, which was freely lavished on public and  private buildings. The magnificence of the former was only equalled in  the days of ancient Rome, and it is doubtful if the latter have ever  been surpassed in sumptuousness and splendor. The palaces of Venice  form an architectural group of great interest, in many respects quite  distinct from the contemporary buildings on the mainland. They were  carefully planned to satisfy the demands for comfort and convenience  as well as display. Most of them have the same arrangement of plan,  and were commonly built of two lofty and two low stories. On the  ground floor, or water level, is a hall running back from the gate to  a bit of garden at the other side of the palace, and on either side  of this hall, which was hung with the family trophies of the chase and  war,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#1)"],[1,"AMERICAN FRUGAL HOUSEWIFE.    by    MRS.

APPENDIX.                It has become necessary to change the title of this work      to the \"_American_ Frugal Housewife,\" because there is an      _English_ work of the same name, not adapted to the wants of      this country.          INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER        The true economy of housekeeping is simply the art of gathering up all  the fragments, so that nothing be lost. I mean fragments of _time_,  as well as _materials_. Nothing should be thrown away so long as it  is possible to make any use of it, however trifling that use may be;  and whatever be the size of a family, every member should be employed  either in earning or saving money.    'Time is money.' For this reason, cheap as stockings are, it is good  economy to knit them. Cotton and woollen yarn are both cheap; hose  that are knit wear twice as long as woven ones; and they can be done  at odd minutes of time, which would not be otherwise employed. Where  there are children, or aged people, it is sufficient to recommend  knitting, that it is an _employment_.    In this point of view, patchwork is good economy. It is indeed  a foolish waste of time to tear cloth into bits for the sake of  arranging it anew in fantastic figures; but a large family may be kept  out of idleness, and a few shillings saved, by thus using scraps of  gowns, curtains, &c.    In the country, where grain is raised, it is a good plan to teach  children to prepare and braid straw for their own bonnets, and their  brothers' hats.    Where turkeys and geese are kept, handsome feather fans may as well be  made by the younger members of a family, as to be bought. The sooner  children are taught to turn their faculties to some account, the  better for them and for their parents.    In this country, we are apt to let children romp away their existence,  till they get to be thirteen or fourteen. This is not well. It is not  well for the purses and patience of parents; and it has a still worse  effect on the morals and habits of the children. _Begin early_ is the  great maxim for everything in education. A child of six years old can  be made useful; and should be taught to consider every day lost in  which some little thing has not been done to assist others.    Children can very early be taught to take all the care of their own  clothes.    They can knit garters, suspenders, and stockings; they can make  patchwork and braid straw; they can make mats for the table, and mats  for the floor; they can weed the garden, and pick cranberries from the  meadow, to be carried to market.    Provided brothers and sisters go together, and are not allowed to go  with bad children, it is a great deal better for the boys and girls  on a farm to be picking blackberries at six cents a quart, than to be  wearing out their clothes in useless play. They enjoy themselves just  as well; and they are earning something to buy clothes, at the same  time they are tearing them.    It is wise to keep an exact account of all you expend--even of a  paper of pins. This answers two purposes; it makes you more careful in  spending money, and it enables your husband to judge precisely whether  his family live within his income. No false pride, or foolish ambition  to appear as well as others, should ever induce a person to live one  cent beyond the income of which he is certain. If you have two dollars  a day, let nothing but sickness induce you to spend more than nine  shillings; if you have one dollar a day, do not spend but seventy-five  cents; if you have half a dollar a day, be satisfied to spend forty  cents.    To associate with influential and genteel people with an appearance of  equality, unquestionably has its advantages; particularly where there  is a family of sons and daughters just coming upon the theatre of  life; but, like all other external advantages, these have their proper  price, and may be bought too dearly. They who never reserve a cent  of their income, with which to meet any unforeseen calamity, 'pay too  dear for the whistle,' whatever temporary benefits they may derive  from society. Self-denial, in proportion to the narrowness of your  income, will eventually be the happiest and most respectable course  for you and yours. If you are prosperous, perseverance and industry  will not fail to place you in such a situation as your ambition  covets; and if you are not prosperous, it will be well for your  children that they have not been educated to higher hopes than they  will ever realize.    If you are about to furnish a house, do not spend all your money,  be it much or little. Do not let the beauty of this thing, and the  cheapness of that, tempt you to buy unnecessary articles. Doctor  Franklin's maxim was a wise one, 'Nothing is cheap that we do not  want.' Buy merely enough to get along with at first. It is only by  experience that you can tell what will be the wants of your family. If  you spend all your money, you will find you have purchased many things  you do not want, and have no means left to get many things which you  do want. If you have enough, and more than enough, to get everything  suitable to your situation, do not think you must spend it all, merely  because you happen to have it. Begin humbly. As riches increase, it  is easy and pleasant to increase in hospitality and splendour; but  it is always painful and inconvenient to decrease. After all, these  things are viewed in their proper light by the truly judicious and  respectable. Neatness, tastefulness, and good sense, may be shown in  the management of a small household, and the arrangement of a little  furniture, as well as upon a larger scale; and these qualities are  always praised, and always treated with respect and attention. The  consideration which many purchase by living beyond their income, and  of course living upon others, is not worth the trouble it costs.  The glare there is about this false and wicked parade is deceptive;  it does not in fact procure a man valuable friends, or extensive  influence. More than that, it is wrong--morally wrong, so far as  the individual is concerned; and injurious beyond calculation to  the interests of our country. To what are the increasing beggary and  discouraged exertions of the present period owing? A multitude of  causes have no doubt tended to increase the evil; but the root of the  whole matter is the extravagance of all classes of people. We never  shall be prosperous till we make pride and vanity yield to the  dictates of honesty and prudence! We never shall be free from  embarrassment until we cease to be ashamed of industry and economy.  "]]]
