MY LORD,    The dignity of the subject of this little Treatise, not any persuasion  of its merits as a literary composition, encourages me to offer it to  your Lordship's patronage. The cause of freedom has always been found  sufficient, in every age and country, to attract the notice of the  generous and humane; and it is therefore, in a more peculiar manner,  worthy of the attention and favour of a personage, who holds a  distinguished rank in that illustrious island, the very air of which has  been determined, upon a late investigation of its laws, to be an  antidote against slavery. I feel a satisfaction in the opportunity,  which the publication of this treatise affords me, of acknowledging your  Lordship's civilities, which can only be equalled by the respect, with  which I am,    Your Lordship's,  much obliged,  and obedient servant,    THOMAS CLARKSON.           *        *        *        *        *        Books Printed and Sold by J.

As the subject of the following work has fortunately become of late a  topick of conversation, I cannot begin the preface in a manner more  satisfactory to the feelings of the benevolent reader, than by giving an  account of those humane and worthy persons, who have endeavoured to draw  upon it that share of the publick attention which it has obtained.    Among the well disposed individuals, of different nations and ages, who  have humanely exerted themselves to suppress the abject personal slavery,  introduced in the original cultivation of the _European_ colonies  in the western world, _Bartholomew de las Casas_, the pious bishop  of _Chiapa_, in the fifteenth century, seems to have been the  first. This amiable man, during his residence in _Spanish America_,  was so sensibly affected at the treatment which the miserable Indians  underwent that he returned to _Spain_, to make a publick remonstrance  before the celebrated emperor _Charles_ the fifth, declaring, that  heaven would one day call him to an account for those cruelties, which  he then had it in his power to prevent. The speech which he made on the  occasion, is now extant, and is a most perfect picture of benevolence  and piety.    But his intreaties, by opposition of avarice, were rendered ineffectual:  and I do not find by any books which I have read upon the subject, that  any other person interfered till the last century, when _Morgan  Godwyn_, a _British_ clergyman, distinguished himself in the  cause.    The present age has also produced some zealous and able opposers of the  _colonial_ slavery. For about the middle of the present century, _John  Woolman_ and _Anthony Benezet_, two respectable members of the  religious society called Quakers, devoted much of their time to the  subject. The former travelled through most parts of _North America_  on foot, to hold conversations with the members of his own sect, on the  impiety of retaining those in a state of involuntary servitude, who had  never given them offence. The latter kept a free school at  _Philadelphia_, for the education of black people. He took every  opportunity of pleading in their behalf. He published several treatises  against slavery,[001] and gave an hearty proof of his attachment to the  cause, by leaving the whole of his fortune in support of that school, to  which he had so generously devoted his time and attention when alive.    Till this time it does not appear, that any bodies of men, had  collectively interested themselves in endeavouring to remedy the evil.  But in the year 1754, the religious society, called Quakers, publickly  testified their sentiments upon the subject,[002] declaring, that \"to  live in ease and plenty by the toil of those, whom fraud and violence  had put into their power, was neither consistent with Christianity nor  common justice.\"    Impressed with these sentiments, many of this society immediately  liberated their slaves; and though such a measure appeared to be  attended with considerable loss to the benevolent individuals, who  unconditionally presented them with their freedom, yet they adopted it  with pleasure: nobly considering, that to possess a little, in an  honourable way, was better than to possess much, through the medium of  injustice. Their example was gradually followed by the rest. A general  emancipation of the slaves in the possession of Quakers, at length took  place; and so effectually did they serve the cause which they had  undertaken, that they denied the claim of membership in their religious  community, to all such as should hereafter oppose the suggestions of  justice in this particular, either by retaining slaves in their  possession, or by being in any manner concerned in the slave trade: and  it is a fact, that through the vast tract of North America, there is not  at this day a single slave in the possession of an acknowledged Quaker.    But though this measure appeared, as has been observed before, to be  attended with considerable loss to the benevolent individuals who  adopted it, yet, as virtue seldom fails of obtaining its reward, it  became ultimately beneficial. Most of the slaves, who were thus  unconditionally freed, returned without any solicitation to their former  masters, to serve them, at stated wages; as free men. The work, which  they now did, was found to better done than before. It was found also,  that, a greater quantity was done in the same time. Hence less than the  former number of labourers was sufficient. From these, and a variety of  circumstances, it appeared, that their plantations were considerably  more profitable when worked by free men, than when worked, as before, by  slaves; and that they derived therefore, contrary to their expectations,  a considerable advantage from their benevolence.    Animated by the example of the Quakers, the members of other sects began  to deliberate about adopting the same measure. Some of those of the  church of England, of the Roman Catholicks, and of the Presbyterians and  Independants, freed their slaves; and there happened but one instance,  where the matter was debated, where it was not immediately put in force.  This was in _Pennsylvania_. It was agitated in the synod of the  Presbyterians there, to oblige their members to liberate their slaves.  The question was negatived by a majority of but one person; and this  opposition seemed to arise rather from a dislike to the attempt of  forcing such a measure upon the members of that community, than from any  other consideration. I have the pleasure of being credibly informed,  that the manumission of slaves, or the employment of free men in the  plantations, is now daily gaining ground in North America. Should  slavery be abolished there, (and it is an event, which, from these  circumstances, we may reasonably expect to be produced in time) let it  be remembered, that the Quakers will have had the merit of its  abolition.    Nor have their brethren here been less assiduous in the cause. As there  are happily no slaves in this country, so they have not had the same  opportunity of shewing their benevolence by a general emancipation. They  have not however omitted to shew it as far as they have been able. At  their religious meetings they have regularly inquired if any of their  members are concerned in the iniquitous _African_ trade. They have  appointed a committee for obtaining every kind of information on the  subject, with a view to its suppression, and, about three or four years  ago, petitioned parliament on the occasion for their interference and  support. I am sorry to add, that their benevolent application was  ineffectual, and that the reformation of an evil, productive of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#1)"],[1,"from images generously made available by the Bibliotheque  nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at http://gallica.bnf.fr                    THE HISTORY OF THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE ABOLITION  OF THE SLAVE-TRADE, BY THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT    BY THOMAS CLARKSON, M.A.    1839        [Illustration: Thomas Clarkson]           *       *       *       *       *          TO    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, LORD GRENVILLE,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES, EARL GREY,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FRANCIS, EARL MOIRA,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GEORGE JOHN, EARL SPENCER,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY RICHARD, LORD HOLLAND,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS, LORD ERSKINE,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDWARD, LORD ELLENBOROUGH,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD HENRY PETTY,    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS GRENVILLE,           *       *       *       *       *    NINE OUT OF TWELVE OF HIS MAJESTY'S LATE CABINET MINISTERS,    TO WHOSE WISE AND VIRTUOUS ADMINISTRATION BELONGS    THE UNPARALLELED AND ETERNAL GLORY    OF THE ANNIHILATION,    AS FAR AS THEIR POWER EXTENDED,    OF ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF CRIMES AND SUFFERINGS,    EVER RECORDED IN THE ANNALS OF MANKIND;    AND TO THE MEMORIES OF    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM PITT,    AND OF    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES JAMES FOX,    UNDER WHOSE FOSTERING INFLUENCE    THE GREAT WORK WAS BEGUN AND PROMOTED;    THIS HISTORY    OF    THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE  TRADE,    IS RESPECTFULLY AND GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED.           *       *       *       *       *          CONTENTS          PREFATORY REMARKS ON THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY        CHAPTER I Introduction.--Estimate of the evil of the Slave      Trade; and of the blessing of the Abolition of it.--Usefulness      of the contemplation of this subject          CHAPTER II Those, who favoured the cause of the Africans      previously to 1787, were so many necessary forerunners in      it.--Cardinal Ximenes; and others          CHAPTER III Forerunners continued to 1787; divided now into four      classes.--First consists of persons in England of various      descriptions, Godwyn, Baxter, and others          CHAPTER IV Second, of the Quakers in England, George Fox, and      his religious descendants          CHAPTER V Third, of the Quakers in America.--Union of these with      individuals of other religious denominations in the same cause          CHAPTER VI Facility of junction between the members of these      three different classes          CHAPTER VII Fourth, consists of Dr. Peckard; then of the      Author.--Author wishes to embark in the cause; falls in with      several of the members of these classes          CHAPTER VIII Fourth class continued; Langton, Baker, and      others.--Author now embarks in the cause as a business of his      life          CHAPTER IX Fourth class continued; Sheldon, Mackworth, and      others.--Author seeks for further information on the subject;      and visits Members of Parliament          CHAPTER X Fourth class continued.--Author enlarges his      knowledge.--Meeting at Mr. Wilberforce's.--Remarkable junction      of all the four classes, and a Committee formed out of them, in      May, 1787, for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.
