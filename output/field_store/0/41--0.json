DEAR FRIEND: Your book of stories gathered from among my tribe has very  much pleased me. The reading of them brings up the days of long time ago  when I was a boy and heard our old people tell these tales in the wigwams  and at the camp fire.    I am very glad that you are in this way saving them from being forgotten,  and I am sure that many people will be glad to read them.    With best wishes,  KECHE CHEMON (Charles Big Canoe),  Chief of the Ojibways.          INTRODUCTORY NOTE      In all ages, from the remotest antiquity, the story-teller has flourished.  Evidences of his existence are to be found among the most ancient monuments  and writings in the Orient. In Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, and other ancient  lands he flourished, and in the homes of the noblest he was ever an honored  guest.    The oldest collection of folklore stories or myths now in existence is of  East Indian origin and is preserved in the Sanskrit. The collection is  called _Hitopadesa_, and the author was Veshnoo Sarma. Of this collection,  Sir William Jones, the great Orientalist, wrote, \"The fables of Veshnoo are  the most beautiful, if not the most ancient, collection of apologues in the  world.\" As far back as the sixth century translations were made from them.    The same love for myths and legends obtains to-day in those Oriental lands.  There, where the ancient and historic so stubbornly resist any change--in  Persia, India, China, and indeed all over that venerable East--the man who  can recite the ancient apologues or legends of the past can always secure  an audience and command the closest attention.    While the general impression is that the recital of these old myths and  legends among Oriental nations was for the mere pastime of the crowds, it  is well to bear in mind that many of them were used as a means to convey  great truths or to reprove error. Hence the recital of them was not  confined to a merely inquisitive audience that desired to be amused. We  have a good example of this in the case of the recital by Jotham, as  recorded in the book of Judges, of the legend of the gathering of the trees  for the purpose of having one of them anointed king over the rest. Of this  legend Dr. Adam Clarke, the commentator, says, \"This is the oldest and,  without exception, the best fable or apologue in the world.\"    The despotic nature of the governments of those Oriental nations caused the  people often to use the fable or myth as an indirect way to reprove or  censure when it would not have been safe to have used a direct form of  speech. The result was that it attained a higher degree of perfection there  than among any other people. An excellent example is Nathan's reproof of  David by the recital of the fable of the poor man's ewe lamb.    The red Indians of America have justly been famous for their myths and  legends. We have never heard of a tribe that did not have a store of them.  Even the hardy Eskimo in his igloo of ice is surprisingly rich in folklore  stories. A present of a knife or some other trifle that he desires will  cause him to talk by the hour to his guest, whether he be the daring trader  or adventurous explorer, on the traditions that have come down to him. The  interchange of visits between the northern Indians and the Eskimos has  resulted in the discovery that quite a number of the myths recited in  Indian wigwams are in a measure, if not wholly, of Eskimo origin. On the  other hand, the Eskimo has not failed to utilize and incorporate into his  own rich store some that are undoubtedly of Indian origin.    For thirty years or more we have been gathering up these myths and legends.  Sometimes a brief sentence or two of one would be heard in some  wigwam--just enough to excite curiosity--then years would elapse ere the  whole story could be secured. As the tribes had no written language, and  the Indians had to depend entirely upon their memory, it is not to be  wondered at that there were, at times, great divergences in the recital of  even the most familiar of their stories. We have heard the same legend  given by several story-tellers and no two agreed in many particulars.  Others, however, were told with very slight differences.    We have adopted the course of recording what seemed to us the most natural  version and most in harmony with the instincts and characteristics of the  pure Indian. The close scientific student of Indian folklore will see that  we have softened some expressions and eliminated some details that were  non-essential. The crude Indian languages, while absolutely free from  blasphemy, cannot always be literally translated. _Verbum sat sapienti_.    The method we have adopted, in the presentation of these myths and legends  in connection with the chatter and remarks of our little ones, while  unusual, will, we trust, prove attractive and interesting. We have  endeavored to make it a book for all classes. Here are some old myths in  new settings, and here are some, we venture to think, that have never  before been seen in English dress. These will interest the student of such  subjects, while the general style of the book will, we hope, make it  attractive to young readers.    Nanahboozhoo, the personage who occupies the principal part in these myths,  is the most widely known of all those beings of supposed miraculous birth  who played such prominent parts in Indian legends. He does not seem to have  been claimed by any one particular tribe. Doubtless legends of him were  transmitted down from the time when the division of tribes had not so  extensively taken place; when perhaps the Algonquin, now so subdivided, was  one great tribe, speaking one language.    The variety of names by which he is known is accounted for by these tribal  divisions and the rapid changes which took place in the language owing to  its having no written form to maintain its unity.    What his original name was, when legends about him first began to be told,  is of course unknown. However, since the white race began to gather up and  record these Indian myths he has been known as Misha-wabus, Manabush,  Jous-ke-ha, Messou, Manabozho, Nanahboozhoo, Hiawatha, Chiabo,  Singua-sew--and even some other names have been heard. We have given him in  this volume the name of Nanahboozhoo as that was the one most frequently  used by the Indians among whom we lived or visited.    There is more unanimity about his origin, among the tribes, than about his  name. The almost universal report is that he was the son of Mudjekeewis,  the West Wind. His mother was Wenonah, the daughter of Nokomis.    The author desires very gratefully to record his indebtedness, for  assistance or hints received in the pleasant work of here clustering these  Indian folklore stories, to many friends, among them such Indian  missionaries as Revs. Peter Jones, John Sunday, Henry Steinham, Allan Salt,  and also to his Indian friends and comrades at many a camp fire and in many  a wigwam. He also wishes in this way to express his appreciation of and  indebtedness to the admirable Reports of the Smithsonian Institution. He  has there obtained verification of and fuller information concerning many  an almost forgotten legend.    In regard to a number of the finest of the photographic illustrations in  the volume the author gratefully acknowledges his obligations to the Canada  Pacific Railway Company, without whose assistance it would have been  impossible to reach many of the sublime and romantic places here portrayed;  until very recently known only to the adventurous red Indian hunter, but  now brought within the reach of any enterprising tourist.

THE WENDIGO    Algernon Blackwood    1910          I      A considerable number of hunting parties were out that year without  finding so much as a fresh trail; for the moose were uncommonly shy, and  the various Nimrods returned to the bosoms of their respective families  with the best excuses the facts of their imaginations could suggest. Dr.  Cathcart, among others, came back without a trophy; but he brought  instead the memory of an experience which he declares was worth all the  bull moose that had ever been shot. But then Cathcart, of Aberdeen, was  interested in other things besides moose--amongst them the vagaries of  the human mind. This particular story, however, found no mention in his  book on Collective Hallucination for the simple reason (so he confided  once to a fellow colleague) that he himself played too intimate a part  in it to form a competent judgment of the affair as a whole....    Besides himself and his guide, Hank Davis, there was young Simpson, his  nephew, a divinity student destined for the \"Wee Kirk\" (then on his  first visit to Canadian backwoods), and the latter's guide, Defago.  Joseph Defago was a French \"Canuck,\" who had strayed from his native  Province of Quebec years before, and had got caught in Rat Portage when  the Canadian Pacific Railway was a-building; a man who, in addition to  his unparalleled knowledge of wood-craft and bush-lore, could also sing  the old _voyageur_ songs and tell a capital hunting yarn into the  bargain. He was deeply susceptible, moreover, to that singular spell  which the wilderness lays upon certain lonely natures, and he loved the  wild solitudes with a kind of romantic passion that amounted almost to  an obsession. The life of the backwoods fascinated him--whence,  doubtless, his surpassing efficiency in dealing with their mysteries.    On this particular expedition he was Hank's choice. Hank knew him and  swore by him. He also swore at him, \"jest as a pal might,\" and since he  had a vocabulary of picturesque, if utterly meaningless, oaths, the  conversation between the two stalwart and hardy woodsmen was often of a  rather lively description. This river of expletives, however, Hank  agreed to dam a little out of respect for his old \"hunting boss,\" Dr.  Cathcart, whom of course he addressed after the fashion of the country  as \"Doc,\" and also because he understood that young Simpson was already  a \"bit of a parson.\" He had, however, one objection to Defago, and one  only--which was, that the French Canadian sometimes exhibited what Hank  described as \"the output of a cursed and dismal mind,\" meaning  apparently that he sometimes was true to type, Latin type, and suffered  fits of a kind of silent moroseness when nothing could induce him to  utter speech. Defago, that is to say, was imaginative and melancholy.  And, as a rule, it was too long a spell of \"civilization\" that induced  the attacks, for a few days of the wilderness invariably cured them.    This, then, was the party of four that found themselves in camp the last  week in October of that \"shy moose year\" 'way up in the wilderness north  of Rat Portage--a forsaken and desolate country. There was also Punk, an  Indian, who had accompanied Dr. Cathcart and Hank on their hunting trips  in previous years, and who acted as cook. His duty was merely to stay in  camp, catch fish, and prepare venison steaks and coffee at a few  minutes' notice. He dressed in the worn-out clothes bequeathed to him by  former patrons, and, except for his coarse black hair and dark skin, he  looked in these city garments no more like a real redskin than a stage  Negro looks like a real African. For all that, however, Punk had in him  still the instincts of his dying race; his taciturn silence and his  endurance survived; also his superstition.    The party round the blazing fire that night were despondent, for a week  had passed without a single sign of recent moose discovering itself.  Defago had sung his song and plunged into a story, but Hank, in bad  humor, reminded him so often that \"he kep' mussing-up the fac's so, that  it was 'most all nothin' but a petered-out lie,\" that the Frenchman had  finally subsided into a sulky silence which nothing seemed likely to  break. Dr. Cathcart and his nephew were fairly done after an exhausting  day. Punk was washing up the dishes, grunting to himself under the  lean-to of branches, where he later also slept. No one troubled to stir  the slowly dying fire. Overhead the stars were brilliant in a sky quite  wintry, and there was so little wind that ice was already forming  stealthily along the shores of the still lake behind them. The silence  of the vast listening forest stole forward and enveloped them.    Hank broke in suddenly with his nasal voice.    \"I'm in favor of breaking new ground tomorrow, Doc,\" he observed with  energy, looking across at his employer. \"We don't stand a dead Dago's  chance around here.\"    \"Agreed,\" said Cathcart, always a man of few words. \"Think the idea's  good.\"    \"Sure pop, it's good,\" Hank resumed with confidence. \"S'pose, now, you  and I strike west, up Garden Lake way for a change! None of us ain't  touched that quiet bit o' land yet--\"    \"I'm with you.\"    \"And you, Defago, take Mr. Simpson along in the small canoe, skip across  the lake, portage over into Fifty Island Water, and take a good squint  down that thar southern shore. The moose 'yarded' there like hell last  year, and for all we know they may be doin' it agin this year jest to  spite us.\"    Defago, keeping his eyes on the fire, said nothing by way of reply. He  was still offended, possibly, about his interrupted story.    \"No one's been up that way this year, an' I'll lay my bottom dollar on  _that!_\" Hank added with emphasis, as though he had a reason for  knowing. He looked over at his partner sharply. \"Better take the little  silk tent and stay away a couple o' nights,\" he concluded, as though the  matter were definitely settled. For Hank was recognized as general  organizer of the hunt, and in charge of the party.    It was obvious to anyone that Defago did not jump at the plan, but his  silence seemed to convey something more than ordinary disapproval, and  across his sensitive dark face there passed a curious expression like a  flash of firelight--not so quickly, however, that the three men had not  time to catch it.    \"He funked for some reason, _I_ thought,\" Simpson said afterwards in the  tent he shared with his uncle. Dr. Cathcart made no immediate reply,  although the look had interested him enough at the time for him to make  a mental note of it. The expression had caused him a passing uneasiness  he could not quite account for at the moment.    But Hank, of course, had been the first to notice it, and the odd thing  was that instead of becoming explosive or angry over the other's  reluctance, he at once began to humor him a bit.    \"But there ain't no _speshul_ reason why no one's been up there this  year,\" he said with a perceptible hush in his tone; \"not the reason you  mean, anyway! Las' year it was the fires that kep' folks out, and this  year I guess--I guess it jest happened so, that's all!\" His manner was  clearly meant to be encouraging.    Joseph Defago raised his eyes a moment, then dropped them again. A  breath of wind stole out of the forest and stirred the embers into a  passing blaze. Dr. Cathcart again noticed the expression in the guide's  face, and again he did not like it. But this time the nature of the look  betrayed itself. In those eyes, for an instant, he caught the gleam of a  man scared in his very soul. It disquieted him more than he cared to  admit.    \"Bad Indians up that way?\" he asked, with a laugh to ease matters a  little, while Simpson, too sleepy to notice this subtle by-play, moved  off to bed with a prodigious yawn; \"or--or anything wrong with the  country?\" he added, when his nephew was out of hearing.    Hank met his eye with something less than his usual frankness.    \"He's jest skeered,\" he replied good-humouredly. \"Skeered stiff about  some ole feery tale! That's all, ain't it, ole pard?\" And he gave Defago  a friendly kick on the moccasined foot that lay nearest the fire.    Defago looked up quickly, as from an interrupted reverie, a reverie,  however, that had not prevented his seeing all that went on about him.    \"Skeered--_nuthin'!_\" he answered, with a flush of defiance. \"There's  nuthin' in the Bush that can skeer Joseph Defago, and don't you forget  it!\" And the natural energy with which he spoke made it impossible to  know whether he told the whole truth or only a part of it.    Hank turned towards the doctor. He was just going to add something when  he stopped abruptly and looked round. A sound close behind them in the  darkness made all three start. It was old Punk, who had moved up from  his lean-to while they talked and now stood there just beyond the circle  of firelight--listening.    \"'Nother time, Doc!\" Hank whispered, with a wink, \"when the gallery  ain't stepped down into the stalls!\" And, springing to his feet, he  slapped the Indian on the back and cried noisily, \"Come up t' the fire  an' warm yer dirty red skin a bit.\" He dragged him towards the blaze and  threw more wood on. \"That was a mighty good feed you give us an hour or  two back,\" he continued heartily, as though to set the man's thoughts on  another scent, \"and it ain't Christian to let you stand out there  freezin' yer ole soul to hell while we're gettin' all good an' toasted!\"  Punk moved in and warmed his feet, smiling darkly at the other's  volubility which he only half understood, but saying nothing. And  presently Dr. Cathcart, seeing that further conversation was impossible,  followed his nephew's example and moved off to the tent, leaving the  three men smoking over the now blazing fire.    It is not easy to undress in a small tent without waking one's  companion, and"]]]
