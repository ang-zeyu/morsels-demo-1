Had he been an  ordinary, prosaic and plodding individual, he would have stayed at home  combing wool as did his prosaic and plodding ancestors for several  generations. At the age of fourteen he went to sea and soon developed an  active curiosity about regions then unknown but believed to exist. There  was even then some knowledge of western Asia, and even of China as  approached from the west. Two and two being properly put together, the  result was a reasonable argument that China and India could be reached from  the other direction, that is, by going westward instead of eastward.    In the early autumn of the year 1492, Columbus was busy discovering islands  in the Caribbean Sea region, and, incidentally, seeking for the richest  of the group. From dwellers on other islands, he heard of one, called  Cubanacan, larger and richer than any that he had then discovered. A  mixture of those tales with his own vivid imagination produced a belief  in a country of wide extent, vastly rich in gold and gems, and already a  centre of an extensive commerce. Cruising in search of what he believed to  be the eastern coast of Asia, he sighted the shore of Cuba on the morning  of October 28, 1492. His journal, under date of October 24, states: \"At  midnight I tripped my anchors off this _Cabo del Isleo de Isabella_, where  I was pitched to go to the island of Cuba, which I learn from these people  is very large and magnificent, and there are gold and spices in it, and  large ships and merchants. And so I think it must be the island of Cipango  (Japan), of which they tell such wonders.\" The record, under date of  Sunday, 28th of October, states: \"Continued for the nearest land of Cuba,  and entered a beautiful estuary, clear of rocks and other dangers. The  mouth of the estuary had twelve fathoms depth, and it was wide enough for a  ship to work into.\" Students have disagreed regarding the first Cuban port  entered by Columbus. There is general acceptance of October 28 as the  date of arrival. Some contend that on that day he entered Nipe Bay, while  others, and apparently the greater number, locate the spot somewhat to the  west of Nuevitas. Wherever he first landed on it, there is agreement that  he called the island Juana, in honor of Prince Juan, taking possession \"in  the name of Christ, Our Lady, and the reigning Sovereigns of Spain.\"    His record of the landing place is obscure. It is known that he sailed some  leagues beyond it, to the westward. While on board his caravel, on his  homeward voyage, he wrote a letter to his friend, Don Rafael Sanchez,  \"Treasurer of their most Serene Highnesses,\" in which the experience is  described. The original letter is lost, but it was translated into Latin  and published in Barcelona in the following year, 1493. While the Latin  form is variously translated into English, the general tenor of all is the  same. He wrote: \"When I arrived at Juana (Cuba), I sailed along the coast  to the west, discovering so great an extent of land that I could not  imagine it to be an island, but the continent of Cathay. I did not,  however, discover upon the coast any large cities, all we saw being a few  villages and farms, with the inhabitants of which we could not obtain any  communication, they flying at our approach. I continued my course, still  expecting to meet with some town or city, but after having gone a great  distance and not meeting with any, and finding myself proceeding toward  the north, which I was desirous, to avoid on account of the cold, and,  moreover, meeting with a contrary wind, I determined to return to the  south, and therefore put about and sailed back to a harbor which I had  before observed.\" That the actual landing was at or near the present port  of Nuevitas seems to be generally accepted.    Columbus appears to have been greatly impressed by the beauty of the  island. In his _Life of Columbus_, Washington Irving says: \"From his  continual remarks on the beauty of scenery, and from his evident delight in  rural sounds and objects, he appears to have been extremely open to those  happy influences, exercised over some spirits, by the graces and wonders  of nature. He gives utterance to these feelings with characteristic  enthusiasm, and at the same time with the artlessness and simplicity of  diction of a child. When speaking of some lovely scene among the groves, or  along the flowery shores of these favored islands, he says, \"One could  live there forever.\" Cuba broke upon him like an elysium. \"It is the most  beautiful island,\" he says, \"that ever eyes beheld, full of excellent ports  and profound rivers.\" A little discount must be made on such a statement.  Granting all that is to be said of Cuba's scenic charms, some allowance is  to be made for two influences. One is Don Cristobal's exuberance, and the  other is the fact that when one has been knocking about, as he had been,  for nearly three months on the open sea and among low-lying and sandy  islands and keys, any land, verdure clad and hilly, is a picture of  Paradise. Many people need only two or three days at sea to reach a similar  conclusion. In his letter to Luis de Santangel, Columbus says: \"All these  countries are of surpassing excellence, and in particular Juana (Cuba,),  which contains abundance of fine harbors, excelling any in Christendom, as  also many large and beautiful rivers. The land is high, and exhibits chains  of tall mountains which seem to reach to the skies and surpass beyond  comparison the isle of Cetrefrey (Sicily). These display themselves in all  manner of beautiful shapes. They are accessible in every part, and covered  with a vast variety of lofty trees which it appears to me never lose their  foliage. Some were covered with blossoms, some with fruit, and others in  different stages according to their nature. There are palm trees of six or  eight sorts. Beautiful forests of pines are likewise found, and fields of  vast extent. Here are also honey and fruits of thousand sorts, and birds of  every variety.\"    Having landed at this indefinitely located point, Columbus, believing that  he had reached the region he was seeking, despatched messengers to the  interior to open communication with some high official of Cathay, in which  country he supposed himself to be, the idea of Cipango apparently having  been abandoned. \"Many at the present day,\" says Washington Irving, \"will  smile at this embassy to a naked savage chieftain in the interior of Cuba,  in mistake for an Asiatic monarch; but such was the singular nature of this  voyage, a continual series of golden dreams, and all interpreted by the  deluding volume of Marco Polo.\" But the messengers went on their journey,  and proceeded inland some thirty or forty miles. There they came upon a  village of about fifty huts and a population of about a thousand. They were  able to communicate only by signs, and it is quite certain that the replies  of the natives were as little understood by the messengers as the questions  were by the natives. The messengers sought something about which the  natives knew little or nothing. The communications were interpreted through  the medium of imagination and desire. Nothing accomplished, the commission  returned and made its disappointing report. Washington Irving thus  describes the further proceedings: \"The report of the envoys put an end to  the many splendid fancies of Columbus, about the barbaric prince and his  capital. He was cruising, however, in a region of enchantment, in which  pleasing chimeras started up at every step, exercising by turns a power  over his imagination. During the absence of the emissaries, the Indians  had informed him, by signs, of a place to the eastward, where the people  collected gold along the river banks by torchlight and afterward wrought it  into bars with hammers. In speaking of this place they again used the words  Babeque and Bohio, which he, as usual, supposed to be the proper names of  islands or countries. His great object was to arrive at some opulent and  civilized country of the East, with which he might establish commercial  relations, and whence he might carry home a quantity of oriental  merchandise as a rich trophy of his discovery. The season was advancing;  the cool nights gave hints of approaching winter; he resolved, therefore,  not to proceed farther to the north, nor to linger about uncivilized places  which, at present, he had not the means of colonizing, but to return to the  east-south-east, in quest of Babeque, which he trusted might prove some  rich and civilized island on the coast of Asia.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11487"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

VOL. 13, NO. 371.] SATURDAY, MAY 23, 1829. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          THE FORTUNE PLAYHOUSE.      [Illustration: The Fortune Playhouse.]      The Engraving represents one of the playhouses of Shakspeare's time,  as the premises appeared a few years since. This theatre was in Golden  Lane, Barbican, and was built by that celebrated and benevolent actor  Edward Alleyn, the pious founder of Dulwich College, in 1599. It was  burnt in 1624, but rebuilt in 1629. A story is told of a large treasure  being found in digging for the foundation, and it is probable that the  whole sum fell to Alleyn. Upon equal probability, is the derivation of  the name \"The Fortune.\" The theatre was a spacious brick building, and  exhibited the royal arms in plaster on its front. These are retained in  the Engraving; where the disposal of the lower part on the building into  shops, &c. is a sorry picture of the \"base purposes\" to which a temple  of the Drama has been converted.    According to the testimony of Ben Jonson and others, Alleyn was the  first actor of his time, and of course played leading characters in the  plays of Shakspeare and Jonson. He was probably the Kemble of his day,  for his biographers tell us such was his celebrity, that he drew crowds  of spectators after him wherever he performed; so that possessing some  private patrimony, with a careful and provident disposition, he soon  became master of an establishment of his own--and this was the  _Fortune_. Although Alleyn left behind him a large sum, it is hardly  probable that he made it here; for in his diary, which, we believe is  extant, he records that he once had so slender an audience, that the  whole receipts of the house amounted to no more than three pounds and a  few odd shillings--a sum which would not pay the expenses; for it  appears by the MS. of Lord Stanhope, treasurer to James I. that the  customary sum paid for the performance of a play at court, was 20  nobles, or 6l. 12s. 4d.[1] Alleyn was likewise proprietor of the  Blackfriars' Theatre, near what is still called Playhouse Yard. However  he might have gathered laurels on the stage, he must have gained his  fortune by other means. He was keeper of the King's Bear Garden and  Menagerie, which were frequented by thousands, and produced Alleyn, the  then great sum of 500_l_. per annum. He was also thrice married, and  received portions with his two first wives; and we need not insist upon  the turn which matrimony gives to a man's fortune.          [1] The nightly expenses of Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres          in these days, are upwards of 200_l_.      Among the theatrico-antiquarian gossip of _The Fortune_ is, that it was  once the nursery for Henry VIII.'s children--but \"no scandal about  the\"--we hope.           *       *       *       *       *          FINE ARTS           *       *       *       *       *      EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY.      All men are critics, in a greater or less degree. They can generalize  upon the merits and defects of a picture, although they cannot point out  the details of the defects, or in what the beauty of a picture consists;  and to prove this, only let the reader visit the Exhibition at Somerset  House, and watch the little critical _coteries_ that collect round the  most attractive paintings. Could all these criticisms be embodied, but  in \"terms of art,\" what a fine lecture would they make for the Royal  Academy.    Our discursive notice would, probably, contribute but little to this  joint-stock production; but as even comparing notes is not always  unprofitable, we venture to give our own.    The present Exhibition is much superior to that of last year. There are  more works of imagination, and consequently greater attractions for the  lover of painting; for life-breathing as have been many of the portraits  in recent exhibitions, the interest which they created was of quite a  different nature to that which we take in not a few of the pictures of  the present collection. Portraits still superabound, and finely painted  portraits too; but, strange to say, there are fewer female portraits in  the present than in any recent exhibition.    But the _elite_ are seven pictures by Mr. Wilkie, who has reappeared, as  it were, in British art, after an absence from England; during which he  appears to have studied manners and costume with beautiful effect; and  the paintings to which we allude, are triumphant proofs of his success.  They are embodiments or realizations of character, manners, and scenery,  with which the painter has been wont to mix, and thus to transfer them  to his canvass with vividness and fidelity--merits of the highest order  in all successes of art. We shall touch upon these pictures in our  ramble through the rooms--    4. _Subject from the Revelations_.--F. Danby--A sublime composition.    10. _The Fountain_: morning.--A.W. Callcott. A delightful picture.    14. _Rubens and the Philosopher_.--G. Clint. The anecdote of Rubens and  Brondel, the alchemist, remarkably well told.    16. _Benaiah_.--W. Etty--The line in 2 Samuel xxiii. 20., \"he slew two  lion-like men of Moab,\" has furnished Mr. Etty with the subject of this  picture. It is a surprising rather than a pleasing composition; but the  strength of colouring is very extraordinary. The disproportions of parts  of the principal figure will, however, be recognised by the most casual  beholder: although as a fine display of muscular energy, this picture is  truly valuable, and is a proud specimen of the powerful genius of the  painter.    28. _Waterfall near Vatlagunta, in the peninsula of India, in the  mountains that divide the Coasts of Coromandel and Malabar: its height  between 500 and 600 feet_.--W. Daniell.--The sublime and stupendous  character of the scenery will enable the reader to form some idea of the  difficulty with which the artist had to contend.    43. _The Lady in St. Swithin's Chair_ from vol. i. Waverley.--Sir W.  Beechey.--We confess ourselves far from pleased with this picture. There  is a want of freedom in it which is any thing but characteristic of the  incident which it is intended to portray.    56. _The Spanish Posado_.--D. Wilkie.--We must describe this picture in  the words of the catalogue:--    This represents a Guerrilla council of war, at which three reverend  fathers--a Dominican, a monk of the Escurial, and a Jesuit, are  deliberating on some expedient of national defence, with an emissary in  the costume of Valencia. Behind them is the posadera, or landlady,  serving her guests with chocolate, and the begging student of Salamanca,  with his lexicon and cigar, making love to her. On the right of the  picture, a contrabandist of Bilboa enters, upon his mule, and in front  of him is an athletic Castilian armed, and a minstrel dwarf, with a  Spanish guitar. On the floor are seated the goatherd and his sister,  with the muzzled house-dog and pet lamb of the family, and through the  open portal in the background is a distant view of the Guadarama  mountains--It is next to impossible for us to do justice to the  diversified character of this picture. The deliberation of the fathers,  and the little bit of episode between the landlady and student are  extremely interesting.    (_To be continued._)           *       *       *       *       *      SPITTLE-FIELDS, AND WEAVING IN FORMER DAYS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      Stowe says, \"On the east side of the churchyard of St. Mary Spittle,  lyeth a large field, of old time called _Lolesworth_, now  _Spittle-Field_, which about the year 1576, was broken up for clay to  make bricke; in digging thereof many earthen pots called urnae, were  found full of ashes and the bones of men, to wit of the Romans that  inhabited here. For it was the custom of the Romans to burne their dead,  to put their ashes in an urne, and then bury the same with certain  ceremonies, in some field appointed for the purpose neere unto their  city. Every one of these pots had in them (with the ashes of the dead)  one piece of copper money, with an inscription of the emperor then  reigning. Some of them were of Claudius, some of Vespasian, some of  Nero, &c. There hath also been found (in the same field) divers coffins  of stone, containing the bones of men; these I suppose to be the bones  of some speciall persons, in the time of the Brittons, or Saxons, after  that the Romans had left to govern here.    \"The priory and hospital of St. Mary Spittle, was founded (says Pennant)  in 1197, by Walter Brune, Sheriff of London, and his wife, Rosia, for  canons regular of the order of St. Augustine. It was remarkable for its  pulpit cross, at which a preacher used to preach a sermon consolidated  out of four others, which had been preached at St. Paul's Cross, on Good  Friday, and the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Easter week; giving  afterwards a sermon of his own. At these sermons the mayor and aldermen  attended, dressed in different coloured robes on each occasion. This  custom continued till the destruction of church government in the civil  wars. They have since been transferred to St. Bride's Church. Queen  Elizabeth, in April, 1559, visited St. Mary Spittal, in great state,  probably to hear a sermon delivered from the cross. This princess was  attended by a thousand men in harness with shirts of mail and corslets,  and morice pikes, and ten great pieces carried through London unto the  court, with drums and trumpets sounding, and two morice-dancers, and in  a cart two white bears.\""]]]
