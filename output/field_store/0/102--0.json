Our materials are collected from all  quarters, with but little of our own; so that we might praise all the  authors without the charge of uncommon vanity; but panegyric savours much  of the poppy, and we must use it accordingly.    Our thanks are first due to such Subscribers as have, by personal  observation and research, enabled us to throw a light on certain obsolete  customs or portions of our domestic history; for these contributions form  a prominent feature of the Correspondence of THE MIRROR; it being our  object, in this department, to gather facts rather than to draw only upon  the invention of our friends. In support of this system we could select  many specimens from the Correspondence of the present volume, the  interest of which is, we hope, be equal to any of its predecessors.    The _Selector_ will be found to contain many valuable extracts from New  and Costly Works, in almost every class of literature; and the piquancy  of the _Notes of a Reader_ may be turned to as a convenient little  treasury, into which readers of all tastes may dip with pleasure and  advantage.    The _Sketch Book_ contains rather an unusual number of Narratives, some  of them of extraordinary interest, and written in the best style of the  best authors.    The _Spirit of Discovery_ will be considered characteristic of our times,  by illustrating the real economy of science in its application to the  conveniences of every-day life. As a collateral branch of this division  is _The Naturalist,_ under which head we have endeavoured to identify THE  MIRROR with Zoology, as one of the most popular studies of the day.    The _Spirit of the Public Journals_ breathes not a few of the sweetest  and most recent poetical compositions from the pens of celebrated authors,  some of whose names are passports to high excellence.    The _Engravings_ have, probably, been criticised upon first impression;  so that we can only hope they have merited the applause of our  Subscribers. We may be permitted to remark that some of the illustrations  relate to scenes and subjects of no ordinary attraction in Antiquarian  Remains, and Architectural Improvements of yesterday; a few of these have  been executed at a considerable cost to the Proprietor; for which extra  exertion he has been more than requited by the increased demand.    Several current _Novelties_ will be found described at length in this  volume--as the circumstantial and accurate accounts of the Colosseum--and  the New Swan River Settlement, the last of which is illustrated with an  Engraved Chart.    Strenuous as have been our exertions for past patronage, we shall not  relax in the ensuing volume. An entirely new Type has been prepared for  this purpose, and we feel confident that we shall be enabled to keep pace  with the increased typographical beauty of the MIRROR, as well as with  the improved spirit of its Engravings.

The present may be regarded as a chemical age; for so extensive, rapid,  and important have been the late acquisitions in the science of chemistry,  that we may almost claim it as the exclusive discovery of our own times.  The popularity and high estimation in which it is held may be ascribed to  three causes: 1. The satisfaction which is afforded by its results.  2. Its utility in all the arts of life. 3. The little previous  preparation which an entrance on its study requires. To these may be  added, the new interest conferred upon the science by the discoveries of  Black, Priestly, and Lavoisier, which had already introduced into  chemical science the long-neglected requisites of close investigation and  logical deduction; but it was reserved for Sir HUMPHRY DAVY to  demonstrate the vast superiority of modern principles, by the most  brilliant career of discovery, which, since the days of Newton, have  graced the annals of science.    Sir Humphry Davy was born December 17, 1779, at Penzance, in Cornwall.  His family was ancient, and above the middle class; his paternal great  grandfather had considerable landed property in the parish of Budgwin,  and his father possessed a small paternal estate opposite St. Michael's  Mount, called Farfal, on which he died in 1795, after having injured his  fortune by expending considerable sums in attempting agricultural  improvements. Sir Humphry received the first rudiments of his education  at the grammar-schools of Penzance and Truro: at the former place, he  resided with Mr. John Tomkin, surgeon, a benevolent and intelligent man,  who had been intimately connected with his maternal grandfather, and  treated him with a degree of kindness little less than paternal. His  genius was originally inclined to poetry; and there are many natives of  Penzance who remember his poems and verses, written at the early age of  nine years. He cultivated this bias till his fifteenth year, when he  became the pupil of Mr. (since Dr.) Borlase, of Penzance, an ingenious  surgeon, intending to prepare himself for graduating as a physician at  Edinburgh. As a proof of his uncommon mind, at this early age, it is  worthy of mention, that Mr. Davy laid down for himself a plan of  education, which embraced the circle of the sciences. By his eighteenth  year he had acquired the rudiments of botany, anatomy, and physiology,  the simpler mathematics, metaphysics, natural philosophy, and chemistry.  But chemistry soon arrested his whole attention. Having made some  experiments on the air disengaged by sea-weeds from the water of the  ocean, which convinced him that these vegetables performed the same part  in purifying the air dissolved in water which land-vegetables act in the  atmosphere; he communicated them to Dr. Beddoes, who had at that time  circulated proposals for publishing a journal of philosophical  contributions from the West of England. This produced a correspondence  between Dr. Beddoes and Mr. Davy, in which the Doctor proposed, that  Mr. Davy, who was at this time only nineteen years of age, should suspend  his plan of going to Edinburgh, and take a part in experiments which were  then about to be instituted at Bristol, for investigating the medical  powers of factitious airs; to this proposal Mr. Davy consented, on  condition that he should have the uncontrolled superintendence of the  expements. About this time he became acquainted with Davies Gilbert, Esq.  M.P. a gentleman of high scientific attainments, (now President of the  Royal Society), with whom he formed a friendship which has always  continued; and to Mr. Gilbert's judicious advice may be attributed  Mr. Davy's adoption of and perseverance in the study of chemistry. With  Dr. Beddoes, Mr. Davy resided for a considerable time, and was constantly  occupied in new chemical investigations. Here, he discovered the  respirability of nitrous oxide, and made a number of laborious  experiments on gaseous bodies, which he afterwards published in  \"Researches Chemical and Philosophical,\" a work that was universally well  received by the chemical world, and created a high reputation for its  author, at that time only twenty-one years of age. This led to his  introduction to Count Rumford, and to his being elected Professor of  Chemistry to the Royal Institution in Albemarle-street. On obtaining this  appointment Mr. Davy gave up all his views of the medical profession, and  devoted himself entirely to chemistry.    Mr. Davy's first experiments as Professor of Chemistry in the Royal  Institution, were made on the substance employed in the process of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#1)"],[1,"HORTENSE    A Life picture of the Napoleonic Era    BY    L.

DAYS OF CHILDHOOD.    \"One moment of bliss is not too dearly bought with death,\" says our  great German poet, and he may be right; but a moment of bliss purchased  with a long lifetime full of trial and suffering is far too costly.    And when did it come for her, this \"moment of bliss?\" When could  Hortense Beauharnais, in speaking of herself, declare, \"I am happy? Now,  let suffering and sorrow come upon me, if they will; I have tasted  felicity, and, in the memories it has left me, it is imperishable  and eternal!\"    Much, very much, had this daughter of an empress and mother of an  emperor to endure.    In her earliest youth she had been made familiar with misfortune and  with tears; and in her later life, as maiden, wife, and mother, she was  not spared.    A touchingly-beautiful figure amid the drama of the Napoleonic days was  this gentle and yet high-spirited queen, who, when she had descended  from the throne and had ceased to be a sovereign, exhausted and weary of  life, found refuge at length in the grave, yet still survived among us  as a queen--no longer, indeed, a queen of nations, but the Queen  of Flowers.    The flowers have retained their remembrance of Josephine's beautiful  daughter; they did not, like so many of her own race, deny her when she  was no longer the daughter of the all-powerful emperor, but merely the  daughter of the \"exile.\" Among the flowers the lovely Hortense continued  to live on, and Gavarni, the great poet of the floral realm, has reared  to her, as Hortensia, the Flower Queen, an enchanting monument, in his  \"_Fleurs Animees_.\" Upon a mound of Hortensias rests the image of the  Queen Hortense, and, in the far distance, like the limnings of a  half-forgotten dream, are seen the towers and domes of Paris. Farther in  the foreground lies the grave of Hortense, with the carved likeness of  the queenly sister of the flowers. Loneliness reigns around the spot,  but above it, in the air, hovers the imperial eagle. The imperial  mantle, studded with its golden bees, undulates behind him, like the  train of a comet; the dark-red ribbon of the Legion of Honor, with the  golden cross, hangs around his neck, and in his beak he bears a  full-blooming branch of the crown imperial.    It is a page of world-renowned history that this charming picture of  Gavarni's conjures up before us--an historical pageant that sweeps by  us in wondrous fantastic forms of light and shadow, when we scan the  life of Queen Hortense with searching gaze, and meditate upon her  destiny. She had known all the grandeur and splendor of earth, and had  seen them all crumble again to dust. No, not all! Her ballads and poems  remain, for genius needs no diadem to be immortal.    When Hortense ceased to be a queen by the grace of Napoleon, she none  the less continued to be a poetess \"by the grace of God.\" Her poems are  sympathetic and charming, full of tender plaintiveness and full of  impassioned warmth, which, however, in no instance oversteps the bounds  of womanly gentleness. Her musical compositions, too, are equally  melodious and attractive to the heart. Who does not know the song, \"_Va  t'en, Guerrier_,\" which Hortense wrote and set to music, and then, at  Napoleon's request, converted into a military march? The soldiers of  France once left their native land, in those days, to the sound of this  march, to carry the French eagles to Russia; and to the same warlike  harmony they have marched forth more recently, toward the same distant  destination. This ballad, written by Hortense, survived. At one time  everybody sang it, joyously, aloud. Then, when the Bourbons had  returned, the scarred and crippled veterans of the _Invalides_ hummed it  under their breath, while they whispered secretly to each other of the  glory of _La Belle France_, as of a beautiful dream of youth, now  gone forever.    To-day, that song rings out with power again through France, and mounts  in jubilee to the summit of the column on the Place Vendome. The bronze  visage of the emperor seems to melt into a smile as these tremulous  billows of melody go sweeping around his brow, and the Hortensias on the  queen's grave raise dreamingly their heads of bloom, in which the dews  of heaven, or the tears of the departed one, glisten like rarest gems,  and seem to look forth lovingly and listen to this ditty, which now for  France has won so holy a significance--holy because it is the  master-chant of a religion which all men and all nations should  revere--the \"religion of our memories.\" Thus, this \"_Va t'en,  Guerrier_,\" which France now sings, resounds over the grave of the  queen, like a salute of honor over the last resting-place of some  brave soldier.    She had much to contend with--this hapless and amiable queen--but she  ever proved firm, and ever retained one kind of courage that belongs to  woman--the courage to smile through her tears. Her father perished on  the scaffold; her mother, the doubly-dethroned empress, died of a broken  heart; her step-father, the Emperor Napoleon, pined away, liked a caged  lion, on a lone rock in the sea! Her whole family--all the dethroned  kings and queens--went wandering about as fugitives and pariahs,  banished from their country, and scarcely wringing from the clemency of  those to whom _they_ had been clement, a little spot of earth, where,  far from the bustle and intercourse of the world, they might live in  quiet obscurity, with their great recollections and their mighty  sorrows. Their past lay behind them, like a glittering fairy tale,  which no one now believed; and only the present seemed, to men and  nations, a welcome reality, which they, with envenomed stings, were  eager to brand upon the foreheads of the dethroned Napoleon race.    Yet, despite all these sorrows and discouragements, Hortensia had the  mental strength not to hate her fellow-beings, but, on the contrary, to  teach her children to love them and do good to them. The heart of the  dethroned queen bled from a thousand wounds, but she did not allow these  wounds to stiffen into callousness, nor her heart to harden under the  broad scars of sorrow that had ceased to bleed. She cherished her  bereavements and her wounds, and kept them open with her tears; but,  even while she suffered measureless woes, it solaced her heart to  relieve the woes and dry the tears of others. Thus was her life a  constant charity; and when she died she could, like the Empress  Josephine, say of herself, \"I have wept much, but never have I made  others weep.\"    Hortense was the daughter of the Viscount de Beauharnais, who, against  the wishes of his relatives, married the beautiful Josephine Tascher de  la Pagerie, a young Creole lady of Martinique. This alliance, which love  alone had brought about, seemed destined, nevertheless, to no happy  issue. While both were young, and both inexperienced, passionate, and  jealous, both lacked the strength and energy requisite to restrain the  wild impulses of their fiery temperaments within the cool and tranquil  bounds of quiet married life. The viscount was too young to be not  merely a lover and tender husband, but also a sober counsellor and  cautious instructor in the difficult after-day of life; and Josephine  was too innocent, too artless, too sportive and genial, to avoid all  those things that might give to the watchful and hostile family of her  husband an opportunity for ill-na"]]]
