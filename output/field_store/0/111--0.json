[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#1)"],[1,"by EMILY DICKINSON          Edited by two of her friends    MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON          PREFACE.    The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson  long since called \"the Poetry of the Portfolio,\"--something produced  absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of  expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably  forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism  and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it  may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the  unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the  present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she  must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,  literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the  doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly  limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,  like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with  great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her  lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great  abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all  conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,  and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own  tenacious fastidiousness.    Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died  there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the  leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known  college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large  reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with  the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these  occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and  did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from  her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence.  The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,  and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if  she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded  with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and  brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as  Undine or Mignon or Thekla.    This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her  personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is  believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a  quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of  anything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and  profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting  an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet  often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are  here published as they were written, with very few and superficial  changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been  assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these  verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with  rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and  a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the  few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at  the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can  delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental  struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,  sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the  reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these  poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an  uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really  unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's  breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin  wrote in his earlier and better days, \"No weight nor mass nor beauty  of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought.\"                ---Thomas Wentworth Higginson                TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE    As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these  early editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the  times. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear  as dots, became commas and semi-colons.    In the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her  handwritten poem which her editors titled \"Renunciation\" is given,  and I here transcribe that manuscript as faithfully as I can,  showing _underlined_ words thus.      There came a day - at Summer's full -  Entirely for me -  I thought that such were for the Saints -  Where Resurrections - be -    The sun - as common - went abroad -  The flowers - accustomed - blew,  As if no soul - that solstice passed -  Which maketh all things - new -    The time was scarce profaned - by speech -  The falling of a word  Was needless - as at Sacrament -  The _Wardrobe_ - of our Lord!    Each was to each - the sealed church -  Permitted to commune -  _this_ time -  Lest we too awkward show  At Supper of \"the Lamb.\"    The hours slid fast - as hours will -  Clutched tight - by greedy hands -  So - faces on two Decks look back -  Bound to _opposing_ lands.    And so, when all the time had leaked,  Without external sound,  Each bound the other's Crucifix -  We gave no other bond -    Sufficient troth - that we shall _rise_,  Deposed - at length the Grave -  To that new marriage -  _Justified_ - through Calvaries - of Love!      From the handwriting, it is not always clear which are dashes,  which are commas and which are periods, nor it is entirely  clear which initial letters are capitalized.    However, this transcription may be compared with the edited  version in the main text to get a flavor of the changes made  in these early editions.          ---JT                          This is my letter to the world,         That never wrote to me, --      The simple news that Nature told,         With tender majesty.        Her message is committed         To hands I cannot see;      For love of her, sweet countrymen,         Judge tenderly of me!                      I. LIFE.      I.    SUCCESS.    [Published in \"A Masque of Poets\"  at the request of \"H.H.,\" the author's  fellow-townswoman and friend.]    Success is counted sweetest  By those who ne'er succeed.  To comprehend a nectar  Requires sorest need.    Not one of all the purple host  Who took the flag to-day  Can tell the definition,  So clear, of victory,    As he, defeated, dying,  On whose forbidden ear  The distant strains of triumph  Break, agonized and clear!            II.    Our share of night to bear,  Our share of morning,  Our blank in bliss to fill,  Our blank in scorning.    Here a star, and there a star,  Some lose their way.  Here a mist, and there a mist,  Afterwards -- day!            III.    ROUGE ET NOIR.    Soul, wilt thou toss again?  By just such a hazard  Hundreds have lost, indeed,  But tens have won an all.    Angels' breathless ballot  Lingers to record thee;  Imps in eager caucus  Raffle for my soul.            IV.    ROUGE GAGNE.    'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!  If I should fail, what poverty!  And yet, as poor as I  Have ventured all upon a throw;  Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so  This side the victory!    Life is but life, and death but death!  Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!  And if, indeed, I fail,  At least to know the worst is sweet.  Defeat means nothing but defeat,  No drearier can prevail!    And if I gain, -- oh, gun at sea,  Oh, bells that in the steeples be,  At first repeat it slow!  For heaven is a different thing  Conjectured, and waked sudden in,  And might o'erwhelm me so!            V.    Glee! The great storm is over!  Four have recovered the land;  Forty gone down together  Into the boiling sand.    Ring, for the scant salvation!  Toll, for the bonnie souls, --  Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,  Spinning upon the shoals!    How they will tell the shipwreck  When winter shakes the door,  Till the children ask, \"But the forty?  Did they come back no more?\"    Then a silence suffuses the story,  And a softness the teller's eye;  And the children no further question,  And only the waves reply.            VI.    If I can stop one heart from breaking,  I shall not live in vain;  If I can ease one life the aching,  Or cool one pain,  Or help one fainting robin  Unto his nest again,  I shall not live in vain.            VII.    ALMOST!    Within my reach!  I could have touched!  I might have chanced that way!  Soft sauntered through the village,  Sauntered as soft away!  So unsuspected violets  Within the fields lie low,  Too late for striving fingers  That passed, an hour ago.            VIII.    A wounded deer leaps highest,  I've heard the hunter tell;  'T is but the ecstasy of death,  And then the brake is still.    The smitten rock that gushes,  The trampled steel that springs;  A cheek is always redder  Just where the hectic stings!    Mirth is the mail of anguish,  In which it cautions arm,  Lest anybody spy the blood  And \"You're hurt\" exclaim!            IX.    The heart asks pleasure first,  And then, excuse from pain;  And then, those little anodynes  That deaden suffering;    And then, to go to sleep;  And then, if it should be  The will of its Inquisitor,  The liberty to die.            X.    IN A LIBRARY.    A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is  To meet an antique book,  In just the dress his century wore;  A privilege, I think,    His venerable hand to take,  And warming in our own,  A passage back, or two, to make  To times when he was young.    His quaint opinions to inspect,  His knowledge to unfold  On what concerns our mutual mind,  The literature of old;    What interested scholars most,  What competitions ran  When Plato was a certainty.

THE EGYPTIAN CONCEPTION OF IMMORTALITY    The Ingersoll Lecture, 1911    by    GEORGE ANDREW REISNER                THE INGERSOLL LECTURESHIP      Extract from the will of Miss Caroline Haskell Ingersoll, who  died in Keene, County of Cheshire, New Hampshire, Jan. 26, 1893.    First.  In carrying out the wishes of my late beloved father,  George Goldthwait Ingersoll, as declared by him in his last will  and testament, I give and bequeath to Harvard University in  Cambridge, Mass., where my late father was graduated, and which  he always held in love and honor, the sum of Five thousand  dollars ($5,000) as a fund for the establishment of a Lectureship  on a plan somewhat similar to that of the Dudleian lecture, that  is--one lecture to be delivered each year, on any convenient  day between the last of May and the first day of December, on  this subject, \"the Immortality of Man,\" said lecture not to form  a part of the usual college course, nor to be delivered by any  Professor or Tutor as part of his usual routine of instruction,  though any such Professor or Tutor may be appointed to such  service.  The choice of said lecturer is not to be limited to any  one religious denomination, nor to any one profession, but may be  that of either clergyman or layman, the appointment to take place  at least six months before the delivery of said lecture.  The  above sum to be safely invested and three fourths of the annual  interest thereof to be paid to the lecturer for his services and  the remaining fourth to be expended in the publishment and  gratuitous distribution of the lecture, a copy of which is always  to be furnished by the lecturer for such purpose.  The same  lecture to be named and known as the \"the Ingersoll lecture on  the Immortality of Man.\"          CONTENTS        I.    Introduction    II.   Sources of the Material    III.

Summary          I. INTRODUCTION        Of the nations which have contributed to the direct stream of  civilization, Egypt and Mesopotamia are at present believed to be  the oldest.  The chronological dispute as to the relative  antiquity of the two countries is of minor importance; for while  in Babylonia the historical material is almost entirely  inscriptional, in Egypt we know the handicrafts, the weapons, the  arts, and, to a certain extent, the religious beliefs of the race  up to a period when it was just emerging from the Stone Age.  In a  word, Egypt presents the most ancient race whose manner of life  is known to man.  From the beginning of its history--that is,  from about 4500 B.C.--we can trace the development of a  religion one of whose most prominent elements was a promise of a  life after death.  It was still a great religion when the  Christian doctrine of immortality was enunciated.  In the early  centuries of the Christian era, it seemed almost possible that  the worship of Osiris and Isis might become the religion of the  classical world; and the last stand made by civilized paganism  against Christianity was in the temple of Isis at Philae in the  sixth century after Christ.    It is clear that a religion of such duration must have offered  some of those consolations to man that have marked all great  religions, chief of which is the faith in a spirit, in something  that preserves the personality of the man and does not perish  with the body.  This faith was, in fact, one of the chief elements  in the Egyptian religion--the element best known to us through  the endless cemeteries which fill the desert from one end of  Egypt to the other, and through the funerary inscriptions.    It is necessary, however, to correct the prevailing impression  that religion played the greatest part in Egyptian life or even a  greater part than it does in Moslem Egypt.  The mistaken belief  that death and the well-being of the dead overshadowed the  existence of the living, is due to the fact that the physical  character of the country has preserved for us the cemeteries and  the funerary temples better than all the other monuments.  The  narrow strip of fat black land along the Nile produces generally  its three crops a year.  It is much too valuable to use as a  cemetery.  But more than that, it is subject to periodic  saturation with water during the inundation, and is, therefore,  unsuitable for the burials of a nation which wished to preserve  the contents of the graves.  On the other hand, the desert, which  bounds this fertile strip so closely that a dozen steps will  usually carry one from the black land to the gray,--the desert  offers a dry preserving soil with absolutely no value to the  living.  Thus all the funerary monuments were erected on the  desert, and except where intentionally destroyed they are  preserved to the present day.  The palaces, the towns, the farms,  and many of the great temples which were erected on the black  soil, have been pulled down for building material or buried deep  under the steadily rising deposits of the Nile.  The tombs of six  thousand years of dead have accumulated on the desert edge.    Moreover, our impression of these tombs has been formed from the  monuments erected by kings, princes, priests, and the great and  wealthy men of the kingdom.  The multitude of plain unadorned  burial-places which the scientific excavator records by the  thousands have escaped the attention of scholars interested in  Egypt from the point of view of a comparison of religions.  It has  also been overlooked that the strikingly colored mummies and the  glaring burial apparatus of the late period cost very little to  prepare.  The manufacture of mummies was a regular trade in the  Ptolemaic period at least.  Mummy cases were prepared in advance  with blank spaces for the names.  I do not think that any more  expense was incurred in Egyptian funerals in the dynastic period  than is the case among the modern Egyptians.  The importance of  the funerary rites to the living must, therefore, not be  exaggerated.          II. SOURCES OF THE MATERIAL      With the exception of certain mythological explanations supplied  by the inscriptions and reliefs in the temples, our knowledge of  Egyptian ideas in regard to the future life is based on funerary  customs as revealed by excavations and on the funerary texts  found in the tombs.  These tombs always show the same essential  functions through all changes of form,--the protection of the  burial against decay and spoliation, and the provision of a  meeting-place where the living may bring offerings to the dead.  Correspondingly, there are two sets of customs,--burial customs  and offering customs.  The texts follow the same division.  For the  offering place, the texts are magical formulas which, properly  recited by the living, provide material benefit for the dead.  For  the burial place, the texts are magical formulas to be used by  the spirit for its own benefit in the difficulties of the spirit  life.  These texts from the burial chambers are found in only a  few graves,--those of the very great,--and their contents  show us that they were intended only for people whose earthly  position was exceptional.    From the funerary customs and the offering texts, a clear view is  obtained of the general conception, the ordinary practice.  We see  what was regarded as absolutely essential to the belief of the  common man.  From the texts found in the burial chambers we get  the point of view of the educated or powerful man, the things  that might be done to gain for him an exceptional place in the  other world.  Both of these classes of material must be  considered, in order to gain a true idea of the practical  beliefs.  For it must be emphasized from the beginning that we  have in Egypt several apparently conflicting conceptions of  immortality.  Nor are we anywhere near obtaining in the case of  the texts the clearness necessary to understand fully all the  differing views held by the priestly classes during a period of  over two thousand years.          III. THE IDEAS OF THE PRIMITIVE RACE      The earliest belief in immortality is that which is shown to us  by the burial customs of the primitive race,--the prehistoric  Egyptian race.    About 4500 B.C.  we find the Egyptian race was just emerging from  the Stone Age.  All the implements and weapons found are of flint  or other stone.  The men of that time were ignorant of writing,  but show a certain facility in line drawings of men, plants, and  animals.  We have found thousands of their graves which all show  the same idea of death.  Each person was buried with implements,  weapons, ornaments,--no doubt those actually used in life,--  with a full outfit of household pots and pans, and with a supply  of food.  The man was dead, but he still needed the same things he  used in ordinary life.  By a fortunate chance we have even  recovered bodies accidentally desiccated and preserved intact in  the dry soil.  These bodies do not show any trace of mutilation,  mummification, or any other preparation for the grave except  probably washing.  The dead body was simply laid on a mat in the  grave, covered with a cloth and a mat or a skin, and then with  clean gravel.  But with it was placed all those things which the  man might need if his life were to go on in some mysterious,  unseen way, as life went on among those on earth.  Possibly his  relations as in later times brought offerings of"]]]
