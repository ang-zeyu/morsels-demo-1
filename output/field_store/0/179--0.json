Occult Miscellany                  277          THE FIRST LESSON      THE ONE.    The Yogi Philosophy may be divided into several great branches, or  fields. What is known as \"Hatha Yoga\" deals with the physical body and  its control; its welfare; its health; its preservation; its laws, etc.  What is known as \"Raja Yoga\" deals with the Mind; its control; its  development; its unfoldment, etc. What is known as \"Bhakti Yoga\" deals  with the Love of the Absolute--God. What is known as \"Gnani Yoga\" deals  with the scientific and intellectual knowing of the great questions  regarding Life and what lies back of Life--the Riddle of the Universe.    Each branch of Yoga is but a path leading toward the one  end--unfoldment, development, and growth. He who wishes first to  develop, control and strengthen his physical body so as to render it a  fit instrument of the Higher Self, follows the path of \"Hatha Yoga.\" He  who would develop his will-power and mental faculties, unfolding the  inner senses, and latent powers, follows the path of \"Raja Yoga.\" He  who wishes to develop by \"knowing\"--by studying the fundamental  principles, and the wonderful truths underlying Life, follows the path  of \"Gnani Yoga.\" And he who wishes to grow into a union with the One  Life by the influence of Love, he follows the path of \"Bhakti Yoga.\"    But it must not be supposed that the student must ally himself to only  a single one of these paths to power. In fact, very few do. The  majority prefer to gain a rounded knowledge, and acquaint themselves  with the principles of the several branches, learning something of  each, giving preference of course to those branches that appeal to them  more strongly, this attraction being the indication of _need_, or  requirement, and, therefore, being the hand pointing out the path.    It is well for every one to know something of \"Hatha Yoga,\" in order  that the body may be purified, strengthened, and kept in health in  order to become a more fitting instrument of the Higher Self. It is  well that each one should know something of \"Raja Yoga,\" that he may  understand the training and control of the mind, and the use of the  Will. It is well that every one should learn the wisdom of \"Gnani  Yoga,\" that he may realize the wonderful truths underlying life--the  science of Being. And, most assuredly every one should know something  of Bhakti Yogi, that he may understand the great teachings regarding  the Love underlying all life.    We have written a work on \"Hatha Yoga,\" and a course on \"Raja Yoga\"  which is now in book form. We have told you something regarding \"Gnani  Yoga\" in our Fourteen Lessons, and also in our Advanced Course. We have  written something regarding \"Bhakti Yoga\" in our Advanced Course, and,  we hope, have taught it also all through our other lessons, for we fail  to see how one can teach or study any of the branches of Yoga without  being filled with a sense of Love and Union with the Source of all  Life. To know the Giver of Life, is to love him, and the more we know  of him, the more love will we manifest.    In this course of lessons, of which this is the first, we shall take up  the subject of \"Gnani Yoga\"--the Yoga of Wisdom, and will endeavor to  make plain some of its most important and highest teachings. And, we  trust that in so doing, we shall be able to awaken in you a still  higher realization of your relationship with the One, and a  corresponding Love for that in which you live, and move and have your  being. We ask for your loving sympathy and cooperation in our task.    Let us begin by a consideration of what has been called the \"Questions  of Questions\"--the question: \"What is Reality?\" To understand the  question we have but to take a look around us and view the visible  world. We see great masses of something that science has called  \"matter.\" We see in operation a wonderful something called \"force\" or  \"energy\" in its countless forms of manifestations. We see things that  we call \"forms of life,\" varying in manifestation from the tiny speck  of slime that we call the Moneron, up to that form that we call Man.    But study this world of manifestations by means of science and  research--and such study is of greatest value--still we must find  ourselves brought to a point where we cannot progress further. Matter  melts into mystery--Force resolves itself into something else--the  secret of living-forms subtly elude us--and mind is seen as but the  manifestation of something even finer. But in losing these things of  appearance and manifestation, we find ourselves brought up face to face  with a Something Else that we see must underlie all these varying  forms, shapes and manifestations. And that Something Else, we call  Reality, because it is Real, Permanent, Enduring. And although men may  differ, dispute, wrangle, and quarrel about this Reality, still there  is one point upon which they must agree, and that is that _Reality is  One_--that underlying all forms and manifestations there must be a  _One_ Reality from which all things flow. And this inquiry into this  One Reality is indeed the Question of Questions of the Universe.    The highest reason of Man--as well as his deepest intuition--has always  recognized that this Reality or Underlying Being must be but ONE, of  which all Nature is but varying degrees of manifestation, emanation, or  expression. All have recognized that Life is a stream flowing from One  great fount, the nature and name of which is unknown--some have said  unknowable. Differ as men do about theories regarding the nature of  this one, they all agree that it can be but One. It is only when men  begin to name and analyze this One, that confusion results.    Let us see what men have thought and said about this One--it _may_ help  us to understand the nature of the problem.    The materialist claims that this one is a something called  Matter--self-existent--eternal--infinite--containing within itself the  potentiality of Matter, Energy and Mind. Another school, closely allied  to the materialists, claim that this One is a something called Energy,  of which Matter and Mind are but modes of motion. The Idealists claim  that the One is a something called Mind, and that Matter and Force are  but ideas in that One Mind. Theologians claim that this One is a  something called a personal God, to whom they attribute certain  qualities, characteristics, etc., the same varying with their creeds  and dogmas. The Naturistic school claims that this One is a something  called Nature, which is constantly manifesting itself in countless  forms. The occultists, in their varying schools, Oriental and  Occidental, have taught that the One was a Being whose Life constituted  the life of all living forms.    All philosophies, all science, all religions, inform us that this world  of shapes, forms and names is but a phenomenal or shadow world--a  show-world--back of which rests Reality, called by some name of the  teacher. But remember this, _all philosophy that counts_ is based upon  some form of monism--Oneness--whether the concept be a known or unknown  god; an unknown or unknowable principle; a substance; an Energy, or  Spirit. There is but One--there can be but One--such is the inevitable  conclusion of the highest human reason, intuition or faith.    And, likewise, the same reason informs us that this One Life must  permeate all apparent forms of life, and that all apparent material  forms, forces, energies, and principles must be emanations from that  One, and, consequently \"of\" it. It may be objected to, that the creeds  teaching a personal god do not so hold, for they teach that their God  is the creator of the Universe, which he has set aside from himself as  a workman sets aside his workmanship. But this objection avails naught,  for where could such a creator obtain the material for his universe,  except from himself; and where the energy, except from the same source;  and where the Life, unless from his One Life. So in the end, it is seen  that there must be but One--not two, even if we prefer the terms God  _and_ his Universe, for even in this case the Universe must have  proceeded from God, and can only live, and move and act, and think, by  virtue of his Essence permeating it.    In passing by the conceptions of the various thinkers, we are struck by  the fact that the various schools seem to manifest a one-sidedness in  their theories, seeing only that which fits in with their theories, and  ignoring the rest. The Materialist talks about Infinite and Eternal  Matter, although the latest scientific investigations have shown us  Matter fading into Nothingness--the Eternal Atom being split into  countless particles called Corpuscles or Electrons, which at the last  seem to be nothing but a unit of Electricity, tied up in a \"knot in the  Ether\"--although just what the Ether is, Science does not dare to  guess. And Energy, also seems to be unthinkable except as operating  through matter, and always seems to be acting under the operation of  Laws--and Laws without a Law giver, and a Law giver without mind or  something higher than Mind, is unthinkable.

TO    Mrs. SARAH     )  Mrs. MARY _and_) ABNEY,  Mrs. ELIZABETH )    _Daughters of Sir_ THOMAS ABNEY, _Kt. and Alderman of London_.      _My Dear Young Friends_,    Whom I am constrained to love and honour by many Obligations. It was  the generous and condescending Friendship of your Parents under my  weak Circumstances of Health, that brought me to their Country-Seat  for the Benefit of the Air; but it was an Instance of most uncommon  Kindness, to supply me there so chearfully for two Years of Sickness  with the richest Conveniences of Life. Such a Favour requires my  most affectionate Returns of Service to themselves, and to all that  is dear to them; and meer Gratitude demands some solemn and publick  Acknowledgment.    But great Minds have the true Relish and Pleasure of doing Good, and  are content to be unknown.    It is such a silent Satisfaction Sir _Thomas Abney_ enjoys in the  unspeakable Blessings of this Year, that brought our present King to  the Throne: and he permits the World to forget that happy Turn that  was given to the Affairs of the Kingdom by his wise Management in  the Highest Office of the City, whereby the Settlement of the Crown  was so much strengthen'd in the Illustrious Family which now  possesses it. O may the Crown flourish many Years on the Head of our  Soveraign, and may his House possess it to the End of Time, to  secure all Religious and Civil Liberties to the Posterity of those  who have been so zealous to establish this Succession!    The fair and lovely Character your Honoured Father hath acquired by  passing thro' all the chief Offices of the City, and leaving a  Lustre upon them, seems imperfect in his own Esteem, without the  Addition of this Title, _A Succourer and a Friend of the Ministers  of Christ_. And in this part of his Honour the Lady your Mother is  resolved to have an unborrow'd Share, and becomes his daily Rival.    It is to her unwearied Tenderness, and many kind Offices by Night  and Day, in the more violent Seasons of my Indisposition, that  (under God) I own my Life, and Power to write or think. And while I  remember those Hours, I can't forget the cheerful and ready  Attendance of her worthy Sister, her dear Companion and Assistant in  every good Work.    Under the Influence of two such Examples I have also enjoy'd the  Pleasure and Conveniency of your younger Services, according to the  Capacity of your Years; and that with such a Degree of sincere and  hearty Zeal for my Welfare, that you are ready to vie with each  other in the kind Imployment, and assist all you can toward my  Recovery and Usefulness. So that whoever shall reap benefit by any  of my Labours, it is but a reasonable Request, that you share with  me in their Thanks and their Prayers.    But this is a small Part of your Praise.    If it would not be suspected of Flattery, I could tell the World  what an Acquaintance with Scripture, what a Knowledge of Religion,  what a Memory of Divine things both in Verse and Prose is found  among you; and what a just and regular account is given of Sermons  at your Age; to awaken all the Children that shall read these  _Songs_, to furnish their memories and beautify their Souls like  yours. The Honour you have done me in learning by heart so large a  number of the _Hymns_ I have publish'd, perhaps has been of some use  towards these greater Improvements, and gives me rich Encouragement  to offer you this little Present.    Since I have ventured to shew a Part of your early Character to the  World, I perswade my self you will remember, that it must inlarge  and brighten daily. Remember what the World will expect from the  Daughters of Sir _Thomas Abney's_ Family, under such an Education,  such Examples, and after such fair and promising Blossoms of Piety  and Goodness. Remember what God himself will expect at your hands,  from whose Grace you have received plentiful Distributions in the  Beginning of your Days. May the Blessings of his Right Hand more  enrich you daily, as your Capacities and your Years increase; and  may he add bountifully of the Favours of his Left Hand, Riches and  Honour. May his Grace make you so large a Return of all the Kindness  I have received in your Family, as may prevail above the fondest  Hopes of your Parents, and even exceed the warmest Prayers of    _Your most Affectionate Monitor and obliged Servant in the daily  Views of a future World_,      I. WATTS.    Theobalds,    June 18.  1715.      PREFACE  To all that are concerned in the Education of Children.        My Friends,    It is an awful and important charge that is committed to you. The  wisdom and welfare of the succeeding generation are intrusted with  you beforehand, and depend much on your conduct. The seeds of misery  or happiness in this world, and that to come, are oftentimes sown  very early, and therefore whatever may conduce to give the minds of  children a relish for vertue and religion, ought in the first place  to be proposed to you.    Verse was at first design'd for the service of God, tho' it hath  been wretchedly abused since. The ancients among the Jews and the  Heathens taught their children and disciples the precepts of  morality and worship in verse. The children of Israel were commanded  to learn the words of the song of Moses, Deut. 31. 19,30. And we are  directed in the New Testament, not only to sing with grace in the  heart, but to teach and admonish one another by hymns and songs,  Eph. 5. 19. and there are these four advantages in it:    1. There is a greater delight in the very learning of truths and  duties this way. There is something so amusing and entertaining in  rhymes and metre, that will incline children to make this part of  their business a diversion. And you may turn their very duty into a  reward, by giving them the privilege of learning one of these songs  every week, if they fulfil the business of the week well, and  promising them the book itself when they have learned ten or twenty  songs out of it.    2. What is learnt in verse is longer retained in memory, and sooner  recollected. The like sounds and the like number of syllables  exceedingly assist the remembrance. And it may often happen, that  the end of a song running in the mind may be an effectual means to  keep off some temptation, or to incline to some duty, when a word of  scripture is not upon the thoughts.    3. This will be a constant furniture for the minds of children, that  they may have something to think upon when alone, and sing over to  themselves. This may sometimes give their thoughts a divine turn,  and raise a young meditation. Thus they will not be forced to seek  relief for an emptiness of mind out of the loose and dangerous  sonnets of the age.    4. These _Divine Songs_ may be a pleasant and proper matter for  their daily or weekly worship, to sing one in the family at such  time as the parents or governors shall appoint; and therefore I have  confin'd the verse to the most usual psalm tunes.    The greatest part of this little book was composed several years  ago, at the request of a friend, who has been long engaged in the  work of catechising a very great number of children of all kinds,  and with abundant skill and success. So that you will find here  nothing that savours of a party: the children of high and low  degree, of the Church of England or Dissenters, baptized in infancy  or not, may all join together in these songs. And as I have  endeavoured to sink the language to the level of a child's  understanding, and yet to keep it (if possible) above contempt; so I  have designed to profit all (if possible) and offend none. I hope  the more general the sense is, these composures may be of the more  universal use and service.    I have added at the end an attempt or two of _Sonnets_ on _Moral  Subjects_ for children, with an air of pleasantry, to provoke some  fitter pen to write a little book of them. My talent doth not lie  that way, and a man on the borders of the grave has other work.  Besides, if I had health or leisure to lay out this way, it should  be employ'd in finishing the _Psalms_, which I have so long promised  the world.    May the Almighty God make you faithful in this important work of  education: may he succeed your cares with his abundant graces, that  the rising generation of Great Britain may be a glory amongst the  nations, a pattern to the Christian world, and a blessing to the  earth.        Divine Songs    For    Children.      Song 1.  _A General Song of Praise to God_.    1 How glorious is our Heavenly King,  Who reigns above the sky!  How shall a child presume to sing  His dreadful majesty?    2 How great his power is none can tell,  Nor think how large his grace;  Not men below, nor saints that dwell  On high before his face.    3 Not angels that stand round the Lord  Can search his secret will;  But they perform his heavenly word,  And sing his praises still.    4 Then let me join this holy train,  And my first offerings bring;  Th' eternal God will not disdain  To hear an infant sing.    5 My heart resolves, my tongue obeys,  And angels shall rejoice  To hear their mighty Maker's praise  Sound from a feeble voice.      Song 2.  _Praise for Creation and Providence_.    1 I sing th' almighty power of God,  That made the mountains rise,  That spread the flowing seas abroad,  And built the lofty skies.    2 I sing the wisdom that ordain'd  The sun to rule the day;  The moon shines full at his command,  And all the stars obey.    3 I sing the goodness of the Lord,  That"]]]
