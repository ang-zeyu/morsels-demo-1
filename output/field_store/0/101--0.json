CHAPTER XLIX.----LOUIS XIV. AND HIS COURT.    Louia XIV. reigned everywhere, over his people, over his age, often over  Europe; but nowhere did he reign so completely as over his court.  Never  were the wishes, the defects, and the vices of a man so completely a law  to other men as at the court of Louis XIV. during the whole period of his  long life.  When near to him, in the palace of Versailles, men lived, and  hoped, and trembled; everywhere else in France, even at Paris, men  vegetated.  The existence of the great lords was concentrated in the  court, about the person of the king.  Scarcely could the most important  duties bring them to absent themselves for any time.  They returned  quickly, with alacrity, with ardor; only poverty or a certain rustic  pride kept gentlemen in their provinces.  \"The court does not make one  happy,\" says La Bruyere, \"it prevents one from being so anywhere else.\"    At the outset of his reign, and when, on the death of Cardinal Mazarin,  he took the reins of power in hand, Louis XIV. had resolved to establish  about him, in his dominions and at his court, \"that humble obedience on  the part of subjects to those who are set over them,\" which he regarded  as \"one of the most fundamental maxims of Christianity.\"  \"As the  principal hope for the reforms I contemplated establishing in my kingdom  lay in my own will,\" says he in his Memoires, \"the first step towards  their foundation was to render my will quite absolute by a line of  conduct which should induce submission and respect, rendering justice  scrupulously to any to whom I owed it, but, as for favors, granting them  freely and without constraint to any I pleased and when I pleased,  provided that the sequel of my acts showed that, for all my giving no  reason to anybody, I was none the less guided by reason.\"    [Illustration: THE GRAND MONARCH IN HIS STATE ROBES----9]    The principle of absolute power, firmly fixed in the young king's mind,  began to pervade his court from the time that he disgraced Fouquet and  ceased to dissemble his affection for Mdlle. de La Valliere.  She was  young, charming, and modest.  Of all the king's favorites she alone loved  him sincerely.  \"What a pity he is a king!\" she would say.  Louis XIV.  made her a duchess; but all she cared about was to see him and please  him.  When Madame de Montespan began to supplant her in the king's favor,  the grief of Madame de La Valliere was so great that she thought she  should die of it.  Then she turned to God, in penitence and despair.  Twice she sought refuge in a convent at Chaillot.  \"I should have left  the court sooner,\" she sent word to the king on leaving, \"after having  lost the honor of your good graces, if I could have prevailed upon myself  never to see you again; that weakness was so strong in me that hardly now  am I capable of making a sacrifice of it to God; after having given you  all my youth, the rest of my life is not too much for the care of my  salvation.\"  The king still clung to her.  \"He sent M. Colbert to beg her  earnestly to come to Versailles, and that he might speak with her.  M. Colbert escorted her thither; the king conversed for an hour with her,  and wept bitterly.  Madame de Montespan was there to meet her with open  arms and tears in her eyes.\"  \"It is all incomprehensible,\" adds Madame  de Sevigne; \"some say that she will remain at Versailles, and at court,  others that she will return to Chaillot; we shall see.\"  Madame de La  Valliere remained three years at court, \"half penitent,\" she said humbly,  detained there by the king's express wish, in consequence of the tempers  and jealousies of Madame de Montespan, who felt herself judged and  condemned by her rival's repentance.  Attempts were made to turn Madame  de La Valliere from her inclination for the Carmelites: \"Madame,\" said  Madame Scarron to her one day, \"here are you one blaze of gold: have you  really considered that at the Carmelites' before long, you will have to  wear serge?\"  She, however, persisted.  She was already practising in  secret the austerities of the convent.  \"God has laid in this heart the  foundation of great things,\" said Bossuet, who supported her in her  conflict: \"the world puts great hinderances in her way and God great  mercies; I have hopes that God will prevail; the uprightness of her heart  will carry everything.\"    [Illustration: Madame de la Valliere----10]    \"When I am in trouble at the Carmelites',\" said Madame de La Valliere, as  at last she quitted the court, \"I will think of what those people have  made me suffer.\"  \"The world itself makes us sick of the world,\" said  Bossuet in the sermon he preached on the day of her taking the dress;  \"its attractions have enough of illusion, its favors enough of  inconstancy, its rebuffs enough of bitterness, there is enough of  injustice and perfidy in the dealings of men, enough of unevenness and  capriciousness in their intractable and contradictory humors--there is  enough of it all, without doubt, to disgust us.\"  \"She was dead to me the  day she entered the Carmelites,\" said the king, thirty-five years later,  when the modest and fervent nun expired at last, in 1710, at her convent,  without having ever relaxed the severities of her penance.  He had  married the daughter she had given him to the Prince of Conti.  \"Everybody has been to pay compliments to this saintly Carmelite,\" says  Madame de Sevigne, without appearing to perceive the singularity of the  alliance between words and ideas; \"I was there too with Mademoiselle.  The Prince of Conti detained her in the parlor.  What an angel appeared  to me at last!  She had to my eyes all the charms we had seen heretofore.  I did not find her either puffy or sallow; she is less thin, though, and  more happy-looking.  She has those same eyes of hers, and the same  expression; austerity; bad living, and little sleep have not made them  hollow or dull; that singular dress takes away nothing of the easy grace  and easy bearing.  As for modesty, she is no grander than when she  presented to the world a princess of Conti, but that is enough for a  Carmelite.  In real truth, this dress and this retirement are a great  dignity for her.\"  The king never saw her again, but it was at her side  that Madame de Montespan, in her turn forced to quit the court, went to  seek advice and pious consolation.  \"This soul will be a miracle of  grace,\" Bossuet had said.    [Illustration: Madame de Montespan  12]    It was no longer the time of \"this tiny violet that hides itself in the  grass,\" as Madame de Sevigne used to remark.  Madame de Montespan was  haughty, passionate, \"with hair dressed in a thousand ringlets, a  majestic beauty to show off to the ambassadors: \"she openly paraded the  favor she was in, accepting and angling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV.

THE LIVES OF THE POETS.           *       *       *       *       *          PETER MOTTEAUX,      A French gentleman, born and educated at Rohan, in Normandy. He came  over into England, was a considerable trader, and resided here many  years. He is said to have possessed no inconsiderable share of wit,  and humour; and, besides a translation of Don Quixote, several Songs,  Prologues and Epilogues, together with a Poem on Tea, dedicated to  the Spectator, (see Vol. VII. Numb. 552) he is author of the following  dramatic pieces.    1. Love's a Jest, a Comedy; acted at the new Theatre, in little  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, 1696. In the two scenes, where love is made a  jest, some passages are taken from Italian writers.    2. The Loves of Mars and Venus; a Masque set to Music, performed  at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, 1696; dedicated to colonel  Codrington. The story from Ovid.    3. The Novelty, or every Act a Play; consisting of Pastoral, Comedy,  Masque, Tragedy, and Farce, after the Italian manner; acted at the  Theatre in little Lincoln's-Inn Fields 1697.    The model of this play is formed upon Sir William Davenant's  Play-House to be let: But neither of them met with much success.    4. Europe's Revels for the Peace, and his Majesty's Happy Return, a  Musical Interlude, performed at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,  1697.    5. Beauty in Distress, a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre in  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, 1698. There is some poetry in this play; and in  the multiplicity of its incidents, he has followed the example of the  British Poets. Before this piece, there is prefixed a discourse on the  lawfulness or unlawfulness of plays; written originally in French,  by the learned father Cassaro, divinity professor at Paris; sent by a  friend to Mr. Motteaux.    6. The Island Princess, or the Generous Portugueze; made into an  Opera, and performed at the Theatre-Royal 1701. The music by Mr.  Daniel Purcell, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Leveridge. The greatest part of the  play is taken from Fletcher's Island Princess. Scene the Spice Island.    7. The Four Seasons, or Love in every Age; a musical Interlude, set to  Music by Mr. Jeremiah Clark; printed with the musical Entertainments  of the above Opera. 8. Britain's Happiness, a musical Interlude;  performed at both the Theatres, being part of the entertainment,  subscribed for by the nobility. Scene a prospect of Dover castle  and the sea. This Interlude was long before designed, only as an  introduction to an Opera; which if ever finished was to have been  called the Loves of Europe, every act shewing the manner of the  different nations in their addresses to the fair-sex; of which he has  informed us in his prefatory epistle.    9. Thomyris Queen of Scythia, an Opera; translated from the Italian;  performed at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.    10. The Temple of Love, a Pastoral Opera, from the Italian; performed  at the Queen's Theatre in the Hay-market, by her majesty's servants,  1706. Scene Arcadia. Time of action, the same with that of the  representation.    11. Love Dragoon'd, a Farce.    This gentleman, who seems to have led a very comfortable life, his  circumstances being easy, was unfortunate in his death; for he lost  his life in a disorderly house, in the parish of St. Clement Danes,  not without suspicion of having been murthered; which accident  happened to him, on his birth day in the 58th year of his age, 1718.  His body was interred in his own parish church, being that of St. Mary  Ax, in the city of London.           *       *       *       *       *          Mrs. MANLEY,      The celebrated authoress of the Atalantis, was born in Hampshire, in  one of those islands which formerly belonged to France, of which her  father Sir Roger Manley was governor; who afterwards enjoyed the same  post in other places in England. He was the second son of an ancient  family; the better part of his estate was ruined in the civil war by  his firm adherence to Charles I. He had not the satisfaction of  ever being taken notice of, nor was his loyalty acknowledged at the  restoration. The governor was a brave gallant man, of great honour and  integrity.    He became a scholar in the midst of the camp, having left the  university at the age of sixteen, to follow the fortunes of Charles  I. His temper had too much of the Stoic in it to attend much to the  interest of his family. After a life spent in the civil and foreign  wars, he began to love ease and retirement, devoting himself to his  study, and the charge of his little post, without following the court;  his great virtue and modesty, debaring him from solliciting favours  from such persons as were then at the helm of affairs, his deserts  were buried, and forgotten. In this solitude he wrote several tracts  for his own amusement, particularly his Latin Commentaries of the  Civil Wars of England. He was likewise author of the first volume  of that admired work, the Turkish Spy. One Dr. Midgley, an ingenious  physician, related to the family by marriage, had the charge of  looking over his papers. Amongst them he found that manuscript, which  he reserved to his proper use, and by his own pen, and the assistance  of some others, continued the work till the eighth volume was  finished, without having the honesty to acknowledge the author of the  first.    The governor likewise wrote the History of the Rebellion in England,  Scotland and Ireland; wherein the most material passages, battles,  sieges, policies, and stratagems of war, are impartially related  on both sides, from the year 1640, to the beheading of the duke of  Monmouth 1688, in three parts, printed in octavo, in the year 1691.    His daughter, our authoress, received an education suitable to her  birth, and gave very early discoveries of a genius, not only above her  years, but much superior to what is usually to be found amongst her  own sex. She had the misfortune to lose her mother, while she was  yet an infant, a circumstance, which laid the foundation of many  calamities, which afterwards befell her.    The brother of Sir Roger Manley, who was of principles very opposite  to his, joined with the Parliamentarian party; and after Charles I.  had suffered, he engaged with great zeal in the cause of those who  were for settling a new form of government, in which, however, they  were disappointed by the address of Cromwell, who found means  to transfer the government into his own hands, and in place of  instituting a republic, restored monarchy under another name, and  erected a tyranny as dangerous, perhaps, in its consequences, as  that which he had contributed to overthrow. During these heats and  divisions, Mr. Manley, who adhered to the most powerful party, was  fortunate enough to amass an estate, and purchased a title; but these,  upon the restoration, reverted back to the former possessor; so that  he was left with several small children unprovided for. The eldest of  these orphans, Sir Roger Manley took under his protection, bestowed  a very liberal education on him, and endeavoured to inspire his mind  with other principles, than those he had received from his father.  This young gentleman had very promising parts, but under the  appearance of an open simplicity, he concealed the most treacherous  hypocrisy. Sir Roger, who had a high opinion of his nephew's honour,  as well as of his great abilities, on his death-bed bequeathed to him  the care of our authoress, and her youngest sister.    This man had from nature a very happy address, formed to win much upon  the hearts of unexperienced girls; and his two cousins respected him  greatly. He placed them at the house of an old, out-of-fashion aunt,  who had been a keen partizan of the royal cause during the civil wars;  she was full of the heroic stiffness of her own times, and would read  books of Chivalry, and Romances with her spectacles.    This sort of conversation, much infected the mind of our poetess,  and fill'd her imagination with lovers, heroes, and princes; made  her think herself in an inchanted region, and that"]]]
