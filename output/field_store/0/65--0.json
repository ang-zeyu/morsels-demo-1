Zelter      INTRODUCTION TO THE ELECTIVE AFFINITIES      In the spring of the year 1807 Goethe began work on the second part of  _Wilhelm Meister_. He had no very definite plot in view, but proposed to  make room for a number of short stories, all relating to the subject of  renunciation, which was to be the central theme of the _Wanderjahre_. In  the course of the summer, while he was taking the waters at Karlsbad,  two or three of the stories were written. The following spring he set  about elaborating another tale of renunciation, the idea of which had  occurred to him some time before. But somehow it refused to be confined  within the limits of a novelette. As he proceeded the matter grew apace,  until it finally developed into the novel which was given to the world  in 1809 under the title of _The Elective Affinities_.    When that which should be a short story is expanded into a novel one can  usually detect the padding and the embroidery. So it is certainly in  this case. Those long descriptions of landscape-gardening; the copious  extracts from Ottilie's diary, containing many thoughts which would  hardly have entered the head of such a girl; the pages given to  subordinate characters, whose comings and goings have no very obvious  connection with the story,--all these retard the narrative and tend to  hide the essential idea. The strange title, too, has served to divert  attention from the real centre of gravity. Had the tale been called,  say, \"Ottilie's Expiation,\" there would have been less room for  misunderstanding and irrelevant criticism; there would have been less  concern over the moral, and more over the artistic, aspect of the story.    What then was the essential idea? Simply to describe a peculiar tragedy  resulting from the invasion of the marriage relation by lawless passion.  As for the title, it should be remembered that there was just then a  tendency to look for curious analogies between physical law and the  operations of the human mind. Great interest was felt in suggestion,  occult influence, and all that sort of thing. Goethe himself had lately  been lecturing on magnetism. He had also observed, as no one can fail to  observe, that the sexual attraction sometimes seems to act like chemical  affinity: it breaks up old unions, forms new combinations, destroys  pre-existing bodies, as if it were a law that _must_ work itself out,  whatever the consequences. Such a process will now and then defy  prudence, self-respect, duty, even religion,--going its way like a blind  and ruthless law of physics. But if this is to happen the recombining  elements must, of course, have each its specific character; else there  is no affinity and no tragedy.    It is no part of the analogy that the pressure of sex is always and by  its very nature like the attraction of atoms. Aside from the fact that  character consists largely in the steady inhibition of instinct and  passion by the will, there is this momentous difference between atoms or  molecules, on the one hand, and souls on the other: the character of the  atom or molecule is constant, that of the soul is highly variable. There  is no room here for remarks on free will and determinism; suffice it to  say that Goethe does not preach any doctrine of mechanical determinism  in human relations. The scientific analogy must not be pressed too hard.  It is really not important, since after all nothing turns on it.  Whatever interest the novel has it would have if all reference to  chemistry had been omitted. Goethe's thesis, if he can be said to have  one, is simply that character is fate.    He imagines a middle-aged man and woman, Edward and Charlotte, who are,  to all seeming, happily united in marriage. Each has been married before  to an unloved mate who has conveniently died, leaving them both free to  yield to the gentle pull of long-past youthful attachment. Their feeling  for each other is only a mild friendship, but that does not appear to  augur ill, since they are well-to-do, and their fine estate offers them  both a plenty of interesting work. Edward has a highly esteemed friend  called the Captain, who is for the moment without suitable employment  for his ability and energy. Edward can give him just the needed work,  with great advantage to the property, and would like to do so. Charlotte  fears that the presence of the Captain may disturb their pleasant idyl,  but finally yields. She herself has a niece, Ottilie, a beautiful girl  whom no one understands and who is not doing well at her  boarding-school. Charlotte would like to have the girl under her own  care. After much debate the pair take both the Captain and Ottilie into  their spacious castle.    And now the elective affinity begins to do its disastrous work. Edward,  who has always indulged himself in every whim and has no other standard  of conduct, falls madly in love with the charming Ottilie, who has a  passion for making herself useful and serving everybody. She adapts  herself to Edward, fails to see what a shabby specimen of a man he  really is, humors his whims, and worships him--at first in an innocent  girlish way. Charlotte is not long in discovering that the Captain is a  much better man than her husband; she loves him, but within the limits  of wifely duty. In the vulgar world of prose such a tangle could be most  easily straightened out by divorce and remarriage. This is what Edward  proposes and tries to bring about. The others are almost won over to  this solution when the event happens that precipitates the tragedy: the  child of Edward and Charlotte is accidentally drowned by Ottilie's  carelessness.    It is a very dubious link in Goethe's fiction that this child, while the  genuine offspring of Edward and Charlotte, has the features of Ottilie  and the Captain. From the moment of the drowning Ottilie is a changed  being. Her character quickly matures; like a wakened sleep-walker she  sees what a dangerous path she has been treading. She feels that  marriage with Edward would be a crime. She resists his passionate  appeals, and her remorse takes on a morbid tinge. It becomes a fixed  idea. Happiness is not for her. She must renounce it all. She must  atone--atone--for her awful sin. For a moment they plan to send her back  to school, but she cannot tear herself away from Edward's sinister  presence. At last she refuses food and gradually starves herself to  death. The wretched Edward does likewise.    Any just appreciation of Goethe's art in _The Elective Affinities_ must  begin by recognizing that it is about Ottilie. For her sake the book was  written. It is a study of a delicately organized virgin soul caught in  the meshes of an ignoble fate and beating its wings in hopeless misery  until death ends the struggle. The other characters are ordinary people:  Charlotte and the Captain ordinary in their good sense and self-control,  Edward ordinary in his moral flabbiness and his foolish infatuation. His  death, to be sure, is unthinkable for such a man and does but testify to  the unearthly attraction with which the girl is invested by Goethe's  art. The figure of Ottilie, like that of her spiritual sister Mignon, is  irradiated by a light that never was on sea or land. She is a creature  of romance, and we learn without much surprise that her dead body  performs miracles. One is reminded of that medieval lady who is doomed  to eat the heart of her crusading lover and then refuses all other food  and dies. That Edward is quite unworthy of the girl's love, that the  death of the child is no sufficient reason for her morbid remorse, is  quite immaterial, since at the end of the tale we are no longer in the  realm of normal psychology. A season of dreamy happiness, as she moves  about in a world unrealized; then a terrible shock, and after that,  remorse, renunciation, hopelessness, the will to die.
