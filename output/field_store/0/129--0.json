Our attention has been invited to the Beulah Spa by a _brochure_ lately  published, from the very competent pen of Dr. George Hume Weatherhead; the  details of which will be read with interest by all who are in quest of  \"healing founts.\" \"The Spa,\" observes Dr. Weatherhead, \"has long been  resorted to by the country people of the neighbourhood, who, from  experiencing its beneficial effects in a variety of diseases, have  sustained its sanative character, and kept it from sinking into total  neglect.\" We trust, however, that its virtues may soon enjoy more  extensive celebrity, especially as the attractions of the scenery amidst  which the spring is situate are of no common-place character, and the  distance from the metropolis both easy and inviting. The Spa has already  acquired some popularity; for, we learned on our visit a few days since,  that, although it was only opened to the public towards the close of the  month of August, in the past year, it was visited during the autumn by  several hundred persons weekly.    Dr. Weatherhead has described the local scenery with accuracy. Beulah, the  estate upon which the spring is situate, is within the village of Norwood,  seven miles south of London, upon one of those elevations known as the  Norwood hills. \"From trigonometrical observation,\" observes Dr.  Weatherhead, \"it has been computed that the height of these hills is about  390 feet above the level of the sea at low water.[1] Thus placed above the  fogs of the plain, and removed from the smoky and contaminated atmosphere  of the metropolis, the air has long been celebrated for its pure and  invigorating qualities.\" Norwood was in the memory of several of the  inhabitants still living, an entire forest of oaks, and the well-known  resort of tribes of gipsies.[2] The country from Camberwell thence is,  therefore, in great part a newly-peopled district. Its outline is very  uneven, perhaps more so than any other portion of the environs of the  metropolis. The road runs over or through many little crests or hills, and  sinks into sheltered valleys, where you see newly-built habitations  nestling together, and almost reminding one of the aboriginal contrivances  for warmth and comfort in less civilized countries. The road-side is set  with \"suburban villas\" which would make the spleen of Cowper blaze into  madness; though few of them exhibit any pretensions to elegance or  snugness. Neither would two newly-built churches in the prospect allay the  anti-urban poet; their starved proportions contrasting but coldly with the  primitive simplicity of a village church. The _country_ itself is  nevertheless picturesque; the prospect is of enchanting beauty, and as  you approach Beulah, you obtain occasional glimpses of the subjacent  valley which you enjoy more at leisure and at a _coup d'oeil_ in the Spa  grounds.    The Spring lies embowered in a wood of oaks, open to the south-west whose  dense foliage shelters and protects it. It is now the sole vestige of the  gipsy haunts, and comprises a space of more than twenty-five acres; the  gentle inclination of the ground keeping the foot-paths always dry.    We entered the grounds at an elegant rustic lodge (_see the Cut_,) where  commences a new carriage-road[3] to Croydon; which winds round the flank  of the hill, and is protected by hanging woods. The lodge is in the best  taste of ornate rusticity, with the characteristic varieties of gable,  dripstone, portico, bay-window, and embellished chimney: of the latter  there are some specimens in the best style of our olden architects. This  building, as well as the other rural edifices in the grounds, and the  whole disposal of the latter, have been planned by Mr. Decimus Burton, the  originator of the architectural embellishments of the Zoological Gardens  in the Regent's Park.    Passing the lodge, we descended by a winding path through the wood to a  small lawn or glade, at the highest point of which is a circular rustic  building, used as a confectionery and reading-room; near which is the Spa,  within a thatched apartment. The spring rises about 14 feet, within a  circular rockwork enclosure; the water is drawn by a contrivance, at once  ingenious and novel; a glass urn-shaped pail, terminating with a cock of  the same material, and having a stout rim and cross-handle of silver, is  attached to a thick worsted rope, and let down into the spring by a pulley,  when the vessel being taken up full, the water is drawn off by the cock.  We quote Dr. Weatherhead's analytical description of the water:    \"The water drawn fresh from the well is beautifully transparent and  sparkling. Innumerable bubbles of fixed air are seen rising to the surface,  when allowed to stand. Its taste is distinctly bitter, without being at  all disagreeable, leaving on the palate the peculiar flavour of its  predominant saline ingredient, the sulphate of magnesia. The temperature  of the water, at the bottom of the well, is 52 deg. of Fahrenheit; its  specific gravity 1011; and, by an analysis of its composition by those  distinguished scientific chemists, Messrs. Faraday and Hume, the following  are the solid contents of a quart of the water:--      BEULAH SALINE.    Sulphate of magnesia ............ 123    Sulphate of soda and magnesia .... 32    Muriate of soda .................. 19    Muriate of magnesia .............. 18-1/2    Carbonate of lime ................ 15    Carbonate of soda ................. 3                                      ---                            Grains    210-1/2      CHELTENHAM PURE SALINE.    Sulphate of magnesia ............. 22    Sulphate of soda ................. 30    Muriate of soda ..................100    Sulphate of lime .................. 9                                      ---                            Grains    161    \"As a mean of comparison, the saline contents of a quart of the Cheltenham  pure saline, as analyzed by Mr. Brande, the predecessor of Mr. Faraday in  the professorship at the Royal Institution, is placed opposite to the  Beulah Spring, to enable the reader to judge how much superior, as an  aperient water, the latter is to that of Cheltenham. And, first, it may be  observed, that the gross amount of the several salts, in the same quantity  of the waters, is much greater in the Beulah than in the Cheltenham spring,  the difference being forty-nine grains and a half of solid saline matter  in a quart--that is, the impregnation is nearly one-third stronger; and,  secondly, the nature of the saline ingredients also merits observation.  One hundred grains out of one hundred and sixty-one, consist, as we see,  in the Cheltenham, of muriate of soda, or common table-salt. Now, this  substance, when perfectly freed from other salts adhering to it, possesses  comparatively very feeble aperient properties; whereas the mass of the  ingredients in the Beulah Spa is composed of two powerful saline  substances, the sulphate of magnesia, and that peculiar double salt, the  sulphate of soda and magnesia, constituting three-fourths of the whole  saline impregnation.\" [4]    The lawn is tastefully varied with parterres of plants; owing to the  lateness of the season, we saw but few near flowering, save          Daffodils,    That come before the swallow dares, and take    The winds of March with beauty, violets dim,    But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes,    Or Cytherea's breath.    A few yards from the lawn a rustic orchestra is in course of erection:  whence \"the dulcet and harmonious sounds\" of music may attune with the  joyful inspiration of the natural beauties of the scene. Our guide, (of a  more intelligent and communicative character than guides usually are,)  directed us by a descending path through the wood, across a rude bridge,  past a maze, by a flight of roughly-formed steps, to a terrace, whence we  enjoyed a picturesque prospect of great range and indescribable beauty.  The woods were as yet leafless, but primroses enlivened the pathside: how  touchingly is their solitude told by our poets. Shakspeare calls them          Pale primroses    That die unmarried ere they can behold    Bright Phoebus in his strength.    Milton describes them as dying forsaken:      Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies:    and Mayne calls this flower      Lorn tenant of the peaceful glade,    Emblem of virtue in the shade.    Dr. Weatherhead describes the prospect from this terrace with more  minuteness than the hazy state of the atmosphere enabled us to trace its  several beauties. The ancient archiepiscopal town of Croydon lies at your  feet; more remote, Banstead Downs spread a carpet of blooming verdure to  the sight; in the extreme distance Windsor Castle peers its majestic  towers above the mist; while elsewhere the utmost verge of the horizon is  bounded by the bold range of the Surrey and Hampshire hills. Turning to  the left you enjoy a view of Addiscombe Place, the seminary for cadets of  the East India Company; of Shirley, the sporting seat of John Maberly, Esq.  M.P.; of the Addington hills clothed with heaths; and of the park, the  seat of his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury; when the prospect,  deepening in extent, stretches as far as Knockholt Beeches, near Seven  Oaks, and, winding round, comprehends the tall spire of Beckenham Church,  piercing through the dense woods which surround it; Shooter's Hill,  Blackheath, and the villages that intervene.    Immediately beneath you are the grounds of the Spa, every portion of which  can be distinctly traced from this spot: the lodge, lawn, refreshment-room,  spring, and orchestra, as we have described them, and the paths winding  among the woods till they disappear as it were in trackless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],[0,"A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#1)"],[1,"ebook was prepared by Les Bowler, St. Ives, Dorset.          VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND, EGYPT, AND ITALY          [Illustration 1. Frontispiece:--JERUSALEM.   ill1.jpg]    By Madame Ida Pfeiffer.    Translated from the German by H. W. Dulcken.    [Illustration 2.  Title-page:--NAZARETH.   ill2.jpg]          PREFACE BY THE VIENNA PUBLISHER      For two centuries the princes and nations of the West were  accustomed to wander towards the land of the morning.  In vain was  the noblest blood poured forth in streams in the effort to wrest the  country of our heavenly Teacher from the grasp of the infidel; and  though the Christian Europe of the present day forbears to renew a  struggle which, considering the strength that has been gradually  increasing for the last six hundred years, might prove an easy one,  we cannot wonder that millions of the votaries of Christianity  should cherish an earnest longing to wander in the paths the  Redeemer has trod, and to view with their own eyes the traces of the  Saviour's progress from the cradle to the grave.    In the generality of cases, however, the hardships, dangers, and  difficulties of such a journey were sufficient to overthrow the  bravest resolution; and thus the wishes of the majority remained  unfulfilled.    Few _men_ were found to possess the degree of strength and endurance  requisite for the carrying out of such an undertaking; but that a  delicate lady of the higher classes, a native of Vienna, should have  the heroism to do what thousands of men failed to achieve, seemed  almost incredible.    In her earliest youth she earnestly desired to perform this journey;  descriptions of the Holy Land were perused by her with peculiar  interest, and a book of Eastern travel had more charms for her than  the most glowing accounts of Paris or London.    It was not, however, until our Authoress had reached a riper age,  and had finished the education of her sons, that she succeeded in  carrying into effect the ardent aspiration of her youth.    On the 2d of March, 1842, she commenced her journey alone, without  companions, but fully prepared to bear every ill, to bid defiance to  every danger, and to combat every difficulty.  That this undertaking  should have succeeded may almost be looked upon as a wonder.    Far from desiring publicity, she merely kept a diary, in order to  retain the recollections of her tour during her later life, and to  impart to her nearest relatives the story of her fortunes.  Every  evening, though often greatly exhausted with heat, thirst, and the  hardships of travel, she never failed to make notes in pencil of the  occurrences of the day, frequently using a sand-mound or the back of  a camel as a table, while the other members of the caravan lay  stretched around her, completely tired out.    It was in the house of my friend Halm that I first heard of this  remarkable woman, at a time when she had not yet completed her  journey; and every subsequent account of Madame Pfeiffer increased  my desire to make her acquaintance.    In manners and appearance I found her to resemble many other women  who have distinguished themselves by fortitude, firmness of soul,  and magnanimity; and who are in private life the most simple and  unaffected, the most modest, and consequently also the most  agreeable of beings.    My request to read our Authoress's journal was granted with some  timidity; and I am ready to assert that seldom has a book so  irresistibly attracted me, or so completely fixed my attention from  beginning to end, as this.    The simple and unadorned relation of facts, the candour, combined  with strong sound sense, which appear throughout, might put to shame  the bombastic striving after originality of many a modern author.  The scheme and execution of the work are complete and agreeable;  strict truth shines forth from every page, and no one can doubt but  that so pure and noble a mind must see things in a right point of  view.  This circumstance is sufficient in itself to raise the book  above many descriptions of travel to the Holy Land, whose authors,  trusting to the fact that their assertions could not easily be  disproved, have indulged their fancy, seeking to impart interest to  their works by the relation of imaginary dangers, and by  exaggeration of every kind, for the sake of gaining praise and  admiration.  Many such men might blush with shame on reading this  journal of a simple, truth-loving woman.    After much trouble I succeeded in persuading the Authoress to allow  her journal to appear in print.    My efforts were called forth by the desire to furnish the reading  public, and particularly the female portion, with a very interesting  and attractive, and at the same time a strictly authentic picture of  the Holy Land, and of Madame Pfeiffer's entire journey.
