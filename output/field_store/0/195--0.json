It had been a  topic of conversation between them before the visitor from the West had  been seated before the library fire and had sampled one of the elder  Swift's good cigars.    \"It is not only a future possibility,\" said the latter gentleman,  shrugging his shoulders. \"As far as the Hendrickton and Pas Alos  Railroad Company goes, a two mile a minute gait--not alone on a level  track but through the Pas Alos Range--is an immediate necessity. It's  got to be done now, or our stock will be selling on the curb for about  two cents a share.\"    \"You do not mean just that, do you, Mr. Bartholomew?\" asked Tom Swift  earnestly, and staring at the big-little man before the fire.    Mr. Richard Bartholomew was just that--a \"big-little man.\" In the  railroad world, both in construction and management, he had made an  enviable name for himself.    He had actually built up the Hendrickton and Pas Alos from a  narrow-gauge, \"jerkwater\" road into a part of a great cross-continent  system that tapped a wonderfully rich territory on both sides of the  Pas Alos Range.    For some years the H. & P. A. had a monopoly of that territory.  Now,  as Mr. Bartholomew intimated, it was threatened with such rivalry from  another railroad and other capitalists, that the H. & P. A. was being  looked upon in the financial market as a shaky investment.    But Tom Swift repeated:    \"You do not mean just that, do you, Mr. Bartholomew?\"    Mr. Bartholomew, who was a little man physically, rolled around in his  chair to face the young fellow more directly. His own eyes sparkled in  the firelight. His olive face was flushed.    \"That is much nearer the truth, young man,\" he said, somewhat harshly  because of his suppressed emotion, \"than I want people at large to  suspect. As I have told your father, I came here to put all my cards on  the table; but I expect the Swift Construction Company to take anything  I may say as said in confidence.\"    \"We quite understand that, Mr. Bartholomew,\" said the elder Swift,  softly. \"You can speak freely. Whether we do business or not, these  walls are soundproof, and Tom and I can forget, or remember, as we  wish. Of course if we take up any work for you, we must confide to a  certain extent in our close associates and trusted mechanics.\"    \"Humph!\" grunted the visitor, turning restlessly again in his chair.  Then he said: \"I agree as the necessity of that last statement; but I  can only hope that these walls are soundproof.\"    \"What's that?\" demanded Tom, rather sharply. He was a bright looking  young fellow with an alert air and a rather humorous smile. His father  was a semi-invalid; but Tom possessed all the mental vigor and muscular  energy that a young man should have. He had not neglected his Athletic  development while he made the best use of his mental powers.    \"Believe me,\" said the visitor, quite as harshly as before, \"I begin to  doubt the solidity of all walls. I know that I have been watched, and  spied upon, and that eavesdroppers have played hob with our affairs.    \"Of late, there has been little planned in the directors' room of the  H. & P. A. that has not seeped out and aided the enemy in foreseeing  our moves.\"    \"The enemy?\" repeated Mr. Swift, with mild surprise.    \"That's it exactly! The enemy!\" replied Mr. Bartholomew shortly. \"The  H. & P. A. has got the fight of its life on its hands. We had a hard  enough time fighting nature and the elements when we laid the first  iron for the road a score of years ago.  Now I am facing a fight that  must grow fiercer and fiercer as time goes on until either the H. & P.  A. smashes the opposition, or the enemy smashes it.\"    \"What enemy is this you speak of?\" asked Tom, much interested.    \"The proposed Hendrickton & Western. A new road, backed by new capital,  and to be officered and built by new men in the construction and  railroad game.    \"Montagne Lewis--you've heard of him, I presume--is at the head of the  crowd that have bought the little old Hendrickton & Western, lock,  stock and barrel.    \"They have franchises for extending the road. In the old days the  legislatures granted blanket franchises that allowed any group of  moneyed men to engage in any kind of business as side issues to  railroading. Montagne Lewis and his crowd have got a 'plenty-big'  franchise.    \"They have begun laying iron. It parallels, to a certain extent, our  own line. Their surveyors were smarter than the men who laid out the H.  & P. A. I admit it. Besides, the country out there is developed more  than it was a score of years ago when I took hold.    \"All this enters into the fight between Montagne Lewis and me.  But  there is something deeper,\" said the little man, with almost a snarl,  as he thrashed about again in his chair. \"I beat Montagne Lewis at one  big game years ago. He is a man who never forgets--and who never  hesitates to play dirty politics if he has to, to bring about his own  ends.    \"I know that I have been watched. I know that I was followed on this  trip East. He has private detectives on my track continually. And  worse. All the gunmen of the old and wilder West are not dead. There's  a fellow named Andy O'Malley--well, never mind him. The game at present  is to keep anybody in Lewis's employ from getting wise to why I came to  see you.\"    \"What you say is interesting,\" Mr. Swift here broke in quietly.  \"But I  have already been puzzled by what you first said. Just why have you  come to us--to Tom and me--in reference to your railroad difficulties?\"    \"And this suggestion you have made,\" added Tom, \"about a possible  electric locomotive of a faster type than has, ever yet been put on the  rails?\"    \"That is it, exactly,\" replied Bartholomew, sitting suddenly upright in  his chair. \"We want faster electric motor power than has ever yet been  invented. We have got to have it, or the H. & P. A. might as well be  scrapped and the whole territory out there handed over to Montagne  Lewis and his H. & W. That is the sum total of the matter, gentlemen.  If the Swift Construction Company cannot help us, my railroad is going  to be junk in about three years from this beautiful evening.\"    His emphasis could not fail to impress both the elder and the younger  Swift. They looked at each other, and the interest displayed upon the  father's countenance was reflected upon the features of the son.    If there was anything Tom Swift liked it was a good fight. The clash of  diverse interests was the breath of life to the young fellow. And for  some years now, always connected in some way with the development of  his inventive genius, he had been entangled in battles both of wits and  physical powers. Here was the suggestion of something that would entail  a struggle of both brain and brawn.    \"Sounds good,\" muttered Tom, gazing at the railroad magnate with  considerable admiration.    \"Let us hear all about it,\" Mr. Swift said to Bartholomew.  \"Whether we  can help you or not, we're interested.\"    \"All right,\" replied the visitor again. \"Whether I was followed East,  and here to Shopton, or not doesn't much matter. I will put my  proposition up to you, and then I'll ask, if you don't want to go into  it, that you keep the business absolutely secret. I have got to put  something over on Montagne Lewis and his crowd, or throw up the sponge.  That's that!\"    \"Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew,\" observed Tom's father, encouragingly.    \"To begin with, four hundred miles of our road is already electrified.  We have big power stations and supply heat and light and power to  several of the small cities tapped by the H. & P. A.  It is a paying  proposition as it stands. But it is only paying because we carry the  freight traffic--all the freight traffic--of that region.    \"If the H. & W. breaks in on our monopoly of that, we shall soon be so  cut down that our invested capital will not earn two per cent.--No, by  glory! not one-and-a-half per cent.--and our stock will be dished. But  I have worked out a scheme, Gentlemen, by which we can counter-balance  any dig Lewis can give us in the ribs.    \"If we can extend our electrified line into and through the Pas Alos  Range our freight traffic can be handled so cheaply and so effectively  that nothing the Hendrickton & Western can do for years to come will  hurt us. Get that?\"    \"I get your statement, Mr. Bartholomew,\" said Mr. Swift. \"But it is  merely a statement as yet.\"    \"Sure. Now I will give you the particulars. We are using the Jandel  locomotives on our electrified stretch of road. You know that patent?\"    \"I know something about it, Mr. Bartholomew,\" said the younger  inventor. \"I have felt some interest in the electric locomotive, though  I have done nothing practical in the matter. But I know the Jandel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13640"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 821, September 26, 1891 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreaders Team            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 821          NEW YORK, September 26, 1891    Scientific American Supplement.

The new Labor Exchange is soon to be inaugurated. We give herewith a  view of the entrance facade of the meeting hall. The buildings, which  are the work of Mr Bouvard, architect, of the city of Paris, are  comprised within the block of houses whose sharp angle forms upon  Place de la Republique, the intersection of Boulevard Magenta and  Bondy street. One of the entrances of the Exchange is on a level with  this street. The three others are on Chateau d'Eau street, where the  facade of the edifice extends for a length of one hundred feet. From  the facade and above the balcony that projects from the first story,  stand out in bold relief three heads surrounded by foliage and fruit  that dominate the three entrance doors. These sculptures represent the  Republic between Labor and Peace. The windows of the upper stories are  set within nine rows of columns, from between the capitals of which  stand out the names of the manufacturers, inventors, and statesmen  that have sprung from the laboring classes. Upon the same line, at the  two extremities of the facade, two modillions, traversed through their  center by palms, bear the devices \"Labor\" and \"Peace.\" Above, there is  a dial surmounted by a shield bearing the device of the city of Paris.    The central door of the ground floor opens upon a large vestibule,  around which are arranged symmetrically the post, telegraph,  telephone, and intelligence offices, etc. Beyond the vestibule there  is a gallery that leads to the central court, upon the site of which  has been erected the grand assembly hall. This latter, which measures  20 meters in length, 22 in width, and 6 in height, is lighted by a  glazed ceiling, and contains ten rows of benches. These latter contain  900 seats, arranged in the form of circular steps, radiating around  the president's platform, which is one meter in height. A special  combination will permit of increasing the number of seats reserved for  the labor associations on occasions of grand reunions to 1,200. The  oak doors forming the lateral bays of the hall will open upon the two  large assembly rooms and the three waiting rooms constructed around  the faces of the large hall. In the assembly rooms forming one with  the central hall will take place the deliberations of the syndic  chambers. The walls of the hall will, ere long, receive decorative  paintings.--_L'Illustration._           *       *       *       *       *          MANUFACTURE OF ROLL TAR PAPER.      Roofing paper was first used in Scandinavia early as the last century,  the invention being accredited to Faxa, an official of the Swedish  Admiralty. The first tar and gravel roofs in Sweden were very  defective. The impregnation of the paper with a water-proofing liquid  had not been thought of, and the roofs were constructed by laying over  the rafters a boarding, upon which the unsaturated paper, the sides of  which lapped over the other, was fastened with short tacks. The  surface of the paper was next coated with heated pine tar to make it  waterproof. The thin layer of tar was soon destroyed by the weather,  so that the paper, swelled by the absorption of rain water, lost its  cohesiveness and was soon destroyed by the elements. This imperfect  method of roof covering found no great favor and was but seldom  employed.    In Germany the architect Gilly was first to become interested in tar  paper roofing, and recommended it in his architecture for the country.  Nevertheless the new style of roof covering was but little employed,  and was finally abandoned during the first year of the 19th century.  It was revived again in 1840, when people began to take a renewed  interest in tar paper roofs, the method of manufacturing an  impermeable paper being already so far perfected that the squares of  paper were dipped in tar until thoroughly saturated. The roof  constructed of these waterproof paper sheets proved itself to be a  durable covering, being unimpenetrable to atmospheric precipitations,  and soon several factories commenced manufacturing the paper. The  product was improved continually and its method of manufacture  perfected. The good qualities of tar paper roofs being recognized by  the public, they were gradually adopted. The costly pine tar was soon  replaced by the cheaper coal tar. Square sheets of paper were made at  first; they were dipped sufficiently long in ordinary heated coal tar,  until perfectly saturated. The excess of tar was then permitted to  drip off, and the sheets were dried in the air. The improvement of  passing them through rollers to get rid of the surplus tar was  reserved for a future time, when an enterprising manufacturer  commenced to make endless tar paper in place of sheets. Special  apparatus were constructed to impregnate these rolls with tar; they  were imperfect at first, but gradually improved to a high degree. Much  progress was also made in the construction of the roofs, and several  methods of covering were devised. The defects caused by the old method  of nailing the tar paper direct upon the roof boarding were corrected;  the consequence of this method was that the paper was apt to tear,  caused by the unequal expansion of the roofing boards and paper, and  this soon led to the idea of making the latter independent of the  former by nailing the sides of the paper upon strips running parallel  with the gable. The use of endless tar paper proved to be an essential  advantage, because the number of seams as well as places where it had  to be nailed to the roof boarding was largely decreased. The  manufacture of tar paper has remained at about the same stage and no  essential improvements have been made up to the present. As partial  improvement may be mentioned the preparation of tar, especially since  the"]]]
