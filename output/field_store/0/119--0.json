Assistant in Philosophy, Harvard University      Among students of philosophy the mention of Hegel's name arouses at once  a definite emotion. Few thinkers indeed have ever so completely  fascinated the minds of their sympathetic readers, or have so violently  repulsed their unwilling listeners, as Hegel has. To his followers Hegel  is the true prophet of the only true philosophic creed, to his  opponents, he has, in Professor James's words, \"like Byron's corsair,  left a name 'to other times, linked with one virtue and a thousand  crimes.'\"    The feelings of attraction to Hegel or repulsion from him do not emanate  from his personality. Unlike Spinoza's, his life offers nothing to stir  the imagination. Briefly, some of his biographical data are as follows:  He was born at Stuttgart, the capital of Wuertemberg, August 27, 1770.  His father was a government official, and the family belonged to the  upper middle class. Hegel received his early education at the Latin  School and the Gymnasium of his native town. At both these institutions,  as well as at the University of Tuebingen which he entered in 1788 to  study theology, he distinguished himself as an eminently industrious,  but not as a rarely gifted student. The certificate which he received  upon leaving the University in 1793 speaks of his good character, his  meritorious acquaintance with theology and languages, and his meagre  knowledge of philosophy. This does not quite represent his equipment,  however, for his private reading and studies carried him far beyond the  limits of the regular curriculum. After leaving the University he spent  seven years as family tutor in Switzerland and in Frankfurt-on-the-Main.  Soon after, in 1801, we find him as _Privat-Docent_; then, in 1805, as  professor at the University of Jena. His academic activities were  interrupted by the battle of Jena. For the next two years we meet him as  an editor of a political journal at Bamberg, and from 1808 to 1816 as  rector of the Gymnasium at Nuremberg. He was then called to a  professorship of philosophy at Heidelberg. In 1818 he was called to  Berlin to fill the vacancy left by the death of Fichte. From this time  on until his death in 1831, he was the recognized dictator of one of the  most powerful philosophic schools in the history of thought.    It is no easy task to convey an adequate idea of Hegel's philosophy  within the limits of a short introduction. There is, however, one  central thought animating the vast range of his whole philosophic system  which permits of non-technical statement. This thought will be more  easily grasped, if we consider first the well-known concept of  permanence and change. They may be said to constitute the most  fundamental distinction in life and in thought. Religion and poetry have  always dwelt upon their tragic meaning. That there is nothing new under  the sun and that we are but \"fair creatures of an hour\" in an  ever-changing world, are equally sad reflections. Interesting is the  application of the difference between permanence and change to extreme  types of temperament. We may speak loosely of the \"static\" and the  \"dynamic\" temperaments, the former clinging to everything that is  traditional, conservative, and abiding in art, religion, philosophy,  politics, and life; the latter everywhere pointing to, and delighting  in, the fluent, the novel, the evanescent. These extreme types, by no  means rare or unreal, illustrate the deep-rooted need of investing  either permanence or change with a more fundamental value. And to the  value of the one or the other, philosophers have always endeavored to  give metaphysical expression.    [Illustration: SCHLIESINGER GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL]    Some thinkers have proclaimed change to be the deepest manifestation of  reality, while others have insisted upon something abiding behind a  world of flux. The question whether change or permanence is more  essential arose early in Greek philosophy. Heraclitus was the first one  to see in change a deeper significance than in the permanence of the  Eleatics. A more dramatic opposition than the one which ensued between  the Heracliteans and the Eleatics can scarcely be imagined--both schools  claiming a monopoly of reason and truth, both distrusting the senses,  and each charging the other with illusion. Now the significance of  Hegel's philosophy can be grasped only when we bear in mind that it was  just this profound distinction between the permanent and the changing  that Hegel sought to understand and to interpret. He saw more deeply  into the reality of movement and change than any other philosopher  before or after him.

In all truth, it  is a most garrulous and incoherent narrative. Like the automobile,  part of the time the narrative moves, part of the time it does  not; now it is in the road pursuing a straight course; then again  it is in the ditch, or far afield, quite beyond control and out of  reason. It is impossible to write coolly, calmly, logically, and  coherently about the automobile; it is not a cool, calm, logical,  or coherent beast, the exact reverse being true.    The critic who has never driven a machine is not qualified to  speak concerning the things contained herein, while the critic who  has will speak with the charity and chastened humility which  spring from adversity.    The charm of automobiling lies less in the sport itself than in  the unusual contact with people and things, hence any description  of a tour would be incomplete without reflections by the way; the  imagination once in will not out; it even seeks to usurp the  humbler function of observation. However, the arrangement of  chapters and headings--like finger-posts or danger signs--is such  that the wary reader may avoid the bad places and go through from  cover to cover, choosing his own route. To facilitate the finding  of what few morsels of practical value the book may contain, an  index has been prepared which will enable the casual reader to  select his pages with discrimination.    These confessions and warnings are printed in this conspicuous  manner so that the uncertain seeker after \"something to read\" may  see at a glance the poor sort of entertainment offered herein, and  replace the book upon the shelf without buying.          CHAPTER ONE SOME PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS  THE MADDING CROWD    Any woman can drive an electric automobile, any man can drive a  steam, but neither man nor woman can drive a gasoline; it follows  its own odorous will, and goes or goes not as it feels disposed.    For this very wilfulness the gasoline motor is the most  fascinating machine of all. It possesses the subtle attraction of  caprice; it constantly offers something to overcome; as in golf,  you start out each time to beat your own record. The machine is  your tricky and resourceful opponent. When you think it conquered  and well-broken to harness, submissive and resigned to your will,  behold it is as obstinate as a mule,--balks, kicks, snorts, puffs,  blows, or, what is worse, refuses to kick, snort, puff, and blow,  but stands in stubborn silence, an obdurate beast which no amount  of coaxing, cajoling, cranking will start.    One of the beauties of the beast is its strict impartiality. It  shows no more deference to maker than to owner; it moves no more  quickly for expert mechanic than for amateur driver. When it  balks, it balks,--inventor, manufacturer, mechanic, stand puzzled;  suddenly it starts,--they are equally puzzled.    Who has not seen inventors of these capricious motors standing by  the roadside scratching their heads in despair, utterly at a loss  to know why the stubborn thing does not go? Who has not seen  skilled mechanics in blue jeans and unskilled amateurs in jeans of  leather, so to speak, flat on their backs under the vehicle,  peering upward into the intricacies of the mechanism, trying to  find the cause,--the obscure, the hidden source of all their  trouble? And then the probing with wires, the tugs with wrenches,  the wrestling with screw-drivers, the many trials,--for the most  part futile,--the subdued language of the bunkers, and at length,  when least expected, a start, and the machine goes off as if  nothing at all had been the matter. It is then the skilled driver  looks wise and does not betray his surprise to the gaping crowd,  just looks as if the start were the anticipated result of his  well-directed efforts instead of a chance hit amidst blind  gropings.    One cannot but sympathize with the vanity of the French chauffeur  who stops his machine in the midst of a crowd when it is working  perfectly, makes a few idle passes with wrenches and oil-cans,  pulls a lever and is off, all for the pleasure of hearing the  populace remark, \"He understands his machine. He is a good one.\"  While the poor fellow, who really is in trouble, sweats and groans  and all but swears as he works in vain to find what is the matter,  to the delight of the onlookers who laugh at what seems to them  ignorance and lack of skill.    And why should not these things be? Is not the crowd multitude  always with us--or against us? There is no spot so dreary, no  country so waste, no highway so far removed from the habitations  and haunts of man that a crowd of gaping people will not spring up  when an automobile stops for repairs. Choose a plain, the broad  expanse of which is unbroken by a sign of man; a wood, the depths  of which baffle the eye and tangle the foot; let your automobile  stop for so long as sixty seconds, and the populace begin to  gather, with the small boy in the van; like birds of prey they  perch upon all parts of the machine, choosing by quick intuition  those parts most susceptible to injury from weight and contact,  until you scarcely can move and do the things you have to do.    The curiosity of the small boy is the forerunner of knowledge, and  must be satisfied. It is quite idle to tell him to \"Keep away!\" it  is worse than useless to lose your temper and order him to \"Clear  out!\" it is a physical impossibility for him to do either; the law  of his being requires him to remain where he is and to  indefatigably get in the way. If he did not pry into everything  and ask a thousand questions, the thoughtful observer would be  fearful lest he were an idiot. The American small boy is not  idiotic; tested by his curiosity concerning automobiles, he is the  fruition of the centuries, the genius the world is awaiting, the  coming ruler of men and empires, or--who knows?--the coming master  of the automobile.    Happily, curiosity is not confined to the small boy; it is but  partially suppressed in his elders,--and that is lucky, for his  elders, and their horses, can often help.    The young chauffeur is panicky if he comes to a stop on a lonely  road, where no human habitation is visible; he fears he may never  get away, that no help will come; that he must abandon his machine  and walk miles for assistance. The old chauffeur knows better. It  matters not to him how lonely the road, how remote the spot, one  or two plaintive blasts of the horn and, like mushrooms, human  beings begin to spring up; whence they come is a mystery to you;  why they come equally a mystery to them, but come they will, and  to help they are willing, to the harnessing of horses and the  dragging of the heavy machine to such place as you desire.    This willingness, not to say eagerness, on the part of the farmer,  the truckman, the liveryman, in short, the owner of horses, to  help out a machine he despises, which frightens his horses and  causes him no end of trouble, is an interesting trait of human  nature; a veritable heaping of coals of fire. So long as the  machine is careering along in the full tide of glory, clearing and  monopolizing the highway, the horse owner wishes it in Hades; but  let the machine get into trouble, and the same horse owner will  pull up out of the ditch into which he has been driven, hitch his  horses to the cause of his scare, haul it to his stable, and make  room by turning his Sunday carryall into the lane, and four  farmers, three truckmen, and two liverymen out of five will refuse  all offers of payment for their trouble.    But how galling to the pride of the automobilist to see a pair of  horses patiently pulling his machine along the highway, and how he  fights against such an unnatural ending of a day's run.    The real chauffeur, the man who knows his machine, who can run it,  who is something more than a puller of levers and a twister of  wheels, will not seek or permit the aid of horse or any other  power, except where the trouble is such that no human ingenuity  can repair on the road.    It is seldom the difficulty is such that repairs cannot be made on  the spot. The novice looks on in despair, the experienced driver  considers a moment, makes use of the tools and few things he has  with him, and goes on.    It is astonishing how much can be done with few tools and  practically no supplies. A packing blows out; if you have no  asbestos, brown paper, or even newspaper saturated with oil, will  do for the time being; if a wheel has to be taken off, a  fence-rail makes an excellent jack; if a chain is to be riveted,  an axe or even a stone makes a good dolly-bar and your wrench an  excellent riveting hammer; if screws, or nuts, or bolts drop off,  --and they do,--and you have no extra, a glance at the machine is  sure to"]]]
