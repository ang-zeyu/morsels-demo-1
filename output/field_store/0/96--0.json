The wind  from behind had kept the dust moving forward at a pace just equal to  the gallop of his horse. Not until he had brought his mount to a halt  in front of the hotel and swung down to the ground did either he or  his horse become distinctly visible. Then it was seen that the animal  was in the last stages of exhaustion, with dull eyes and hanging head  and forelegs braced widely apart, while the sweat dripped steadily  from his flanks into the white dust on the street. Plainly he had been  pushed to the last limit of his strength.    The rider was almost as far spent as his mount, for he went up the  steps of the hotel with his shoulders sagging with weariness, a  wide-shouldered, gaunt-ribbed man. Thick layers of dust had turned his  red kerchief and his blue shirt to a common gray. Dust, too, made  a mask of his face, and through that mask the eyes peered out,  surrounded by pink skin. Even at its best the long, solemn face could  never have been called handsome. But, on this particular day, he  seemed a haunted man, or one fleeing from an inescapable danger.    The two loungers at the door of the hotel instinctively stepped aside  and made room for him to pass, but apparently he had no desire to  enter the building. Suddenly he became doubly imposing, as he stood on  the veranda and stared up and down at the idlers. Certainly his throat  must be thick and hot with dust, but an overmastering purpose made him  oblivious of thirst.    \"Gents,\" he said huskily, while a gust of wind fanned a cloud of dust  from his clothes, \"is there anybody in this town can gimme a hoss to  get to Stillwater, inside three hours' riding?\"    He waited a moment, his hungry eyes traveling eagerly from face to  face. Naturally the oldest man spoke first, since this was a matter of  life and death.    \"Any hoss in town can get you there in that time, if you know the  short way across the mountain.\"    \"How do you take it? That's the way for me.\"    But the old fellow shook his head and smiled in pity. \"Not if you  ain't rode it before. I used to go that way when I was a kid, but  nowadays nobody rides that way except Doone. That trail is as tricky  as the ways of a coyote; you'd sure get lost without a guide.\"    The stranger turned and followed the gesture of the speaker. The  mountain rose from the very verge of the town, a ragged mass of sand  and rock, with miserable sagebrush clinging here and there, as dull  and uninteresting as the dust itself. Then he lowered the hand from  beneath which he had peered and faced about with a sigh. \"I guess it  ain't much good trying that way. But I got to get to Stillwater inside  of three hours.\"    \"They's one hoss in town can get you there,\" said the old man. \"But  you can't get that hoss today.\"    The stranger groaned. \"Then I'll make another hoss stretch out and  do.\"    \"Can't be done. Doone's hoss is a marvel. Nothing else about here can  touch him, and he's the only one that can make the trip around the  mountain, inside of three hours. You'd kill another hoss trying to do  it, what with your weight.\"    The stranger groaned again and struck his knuckles against his  forehead. \"But why can't I get the hoss? Is Doone out of town with  it?\"    \"The hoss ain't out of town, but Doone is.\"    The traveler clenched his fists. This delay and waste of priceless  time was maddening him. \"Gents,\" he called desperately, \"I got to  get to Martindale today. It's more than life or death to me. Where's  Doone's hoss?\"    \"Right across the road,\" said the old man who had spoken first. \"Over  yonder in the corral--the bay.\"    The traveler turned and saw, beyond the road, a beautiful mare, not  very tall, but a mare whose every inch of her fifteen three proclaimed  strength and speed. At that moment she raised her head and looked  across to him, and the heart of the rider jumped into his throat. The  very sight of her was an omen of victory, and he made a long stride in  her direction, but two men came before him. The old fellow jumped from  the chair and tapped his arm.    \"You ain't going to take the bay without getting leave from Doone?\"    \"Gents, I got to,\" said the stranger. \"Listen! My name's Gregg, Bill  Gregg. Up in my country they know I'm straight; down here you ain't  heard of me. I ain't going to keep that hoss, and I'll pay a hundred  dollars for the use of her for one day. I'll bring or send her back  safe and sound, tomorrow. Here's the money. One of you gents, that's a  friend of Doone, take it for him.\"    Not a hand was stretched out; every head shook in negation.    \"I'm too fond of the little life that's left to me,\" said the old  fellow. \"I won't rent out that hoss for him. Why, he loves that mare  like she was his sister. He'd fight like a flash rather than see  another man ride her.\"    But Bill Gregg had his eyes on the bay, and the sight of her was  stealing his reason. He knew, as well as he knew that he was a man,  that, once in the saddle on her, he would be sure to win. Nothing  could stop him. And straight through the restraining circle he broke  with a groan of anxiety.    Only the old man who had been the spokesman called after him: \"Gregg,  don't be a fool. Maybe you don't recognize the name of Doone, but the  whole name is Ronicky Doone. Does that mean anything to you?\"    Into the back of Gregg's mind came several faint memories, but they  were obscure and uncertain. \"Blast your Ronicky Doone!\" he replied. \"I  got to have that hoss, and, if none of you'll take money for her rent,  I'll take her free and pay her rent when I come through this way  tomorrow, maybe. S'long!\"    While he spoke he had been undoing the cinches of his own horse. Now  he whipped the saddle and bridle off, shouted to the hotel keeper  brief instructions for the care of the weary animal and ran across the  road with the saddle on his arm.    In the corral he had no difficulty with the mare. She came straight to  him in spite of all the flopping trappings. With prickly ears and eyes  lighted with kindly curiosity she looked the dusty fellow over.    He slipped the bridle over her head. When he swung the saddle over her  back she merely turned her head and carelessly watched it fall. And  when he drew up the cinches hard, she only stamped in mock anger. The  moment he was in the saddle she tossed her head eagerly, ready to be  off.    He looked across the street to the veranda of the hotel, as he passed  through the gate of the corral. The men were standing in a long and  awe-stricken line, their eyes wide, their mouths agape. Whoever  Ronicky Doone might be, he was certainly a man who had won the respect  of this town. The men on the veranda looked at Bill Gregg as though  he were already a ghost. He waved his hand defiantly at them and the  mare, at a word from him, sprang into a long-striding gallop that  whirled them rapidly down the street and out of the village.    The bay mare carried him with amazing speed over the ground. They  rounded the base of the big mountain, and, glancing up at the ragged  canyons which chopped the face of the peak, he was glad that he had  not attempted that short cut. If Ronicky Doone could make that trail  he was a skillful horseman.    Bill Gregg swung up over the left shoulder of the mountain and found  himself looking down on the wide plain which held Stillwater. The air  was crystal-clear and dry; the shoulder of the mountain was high above  it; Gregg saw a breathless stretch of the cattle country at one sweep  of his eyes.    Stillwater was still a long way off, and far away across the plain he  saw a tiny moving dot that grew slowly. It was the train heading for  Stillwater, and that train he must beat to the station. For a moment  his heart stood still; then he saw that the train was distant indeed,  and, by the slightest use of the mare's speed, he would be able to  reach the town, two or three minutes ahead of it.    But, just as he was beginning to exult in the victory, after all the  hard riding of the past three days, the mare tossed up her head and  shortened her stride. The heart of Gregg stopped, and he went cold. It  was not only the fear that his journey might be ruined, but the fear  that something had happened to this magnificent creature beneath him.  He swung to the side in the saddle and watched her gallop. Certain she  went laboring, very much as though she were trying to run against a  mighty pull on the reins.    He looked at her head. It was thrown high, with pricking ears. Perhaps  she was frightened by some foolish thing near the road. He touched her  with the spurs, and she increased her pace to the old length and  ease of stride; but, just as he had begun to be reassured, her step  shortened and fell to laboring again, and this time she threw her head  higher than before. It was amazing to Bill Gregg; and then it seemed  to him that he heard a faint, far whistling, floating down from high  above his head.    Again that thin, long-drawn sound, and this time, glancing over his  right shoulder, he saw a horseman plunging down the slope of the  mountain. He knew instantly that it was Ronicky Doone. The man had  come to recapture his horse and had taken the short cut across the  mountain to come up with her. Just by a fraction of a minute Doone  would be too late, for, by the time he came down onto the trail,  the bay would be well ahead, and certainly no horse lived in those  mountains capable of overtaking her when she felt like running. Gregg  touched her again with the spurs, but this time she reared straight up  and, whirling to the side, faced steadily toward her onrushing master.          Chapter Two      _Friendly Enemies_    Again and again Gregg spurred the bay cruelly.    She winced from the pain and snorted, but, apparently having not the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11887"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

It is something to know that John Scott was born at  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the principal dwelling represented in the  above Engraving, in the year 1751; that he received the rudiments of  his education at the free grammar-school of the town; that he grew up  \"a man of safe discretion;\" that he enjoyed the highest legal honours  which his sovereign could bestow for a quarter of a century; and that  he still lives, a venerable octogenarian, in the enjoyment of \"glory  from his conscience, and honour from men.\" The biography of so  distinguished an individual must have innumerable good tendencies:  it at once inculcates the wholesome truth that \"every man is the  architect of his own fortune;\" and it presents us, moreover, with  the encouraging picture of a well-regulated life, and its healthful  energies so employed in the discharge of important duties as to  entitle the subject to high rank among the worthies of his country.    John Scott, Lord Eldon, is the third son of William Scott, of  Newcastle-upon-Tyne. \"His father was by trade what in the language of  the place is called a 'fitter,' or agent for the sale and shipment  of coals. He had by industry and habits of close saving accumulated  rather considerable means from small beginnings. Beyond this he was  a man of great shrewdness and knowledge of the world,\" and quickly  perceiving the talents of the two younger boys, William (now Lord  Stowell,) and John, he wisely gave them an education in accordance  with their mental endowments. \"It is said that the singular variety  in the talent of these two remarkable youths was manifested at a very  early age. When asked to 'give an account of the sermon,' which was a  constant Sabbath custom of their father, William, the eldest, gave at  once a condensed and lucid digest of the general argument. John,  on the other hand, would go into all the minutiae, but failed in  producing the lucid, general view embodied in half the number of words  by his brother.\"[1] The two boys received their early education at the  free grammar-school of Newcastle.[2] William was from the beginning  destined for the study of the law. John was at first intended for  the church, and was, accordingly, sent to Oxford: early marriage was,  however, the fortunate means of changing his destination, and he began  the world in the same profession with his brother. In 1757, John was  entered as a student at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar  at the usual period. He at this time possessed an extensive stock of  legal information, having been an indefatigable reader, and spent the  two last years of his preliminary studies in the office of a special  pleader. At his outset he made no progress, his powers being palsied  by an oppressive diffidence. He therefore devoted his talents entirely  to being a draftsman in Chancery. His employment was laborious, and  not lucrative, while it materially injured his health. In a fit of  despondency he resolved to retire into humble practice in his native  county; and he had actually given up his chambers and taken leave of  his friends in the metropolis, when he was not only diverted from his  purpose by an eminent solicitor, but was even prevailed upon to make  one more trial at the bar. His first success was the undoubted fruit  of his extraordinary abilities, and is said to have originated in the  sudden illness of a leading counsel the night before the trial of a  complicated civil cause. It could not be put off, and the client  of the lost leader was in despair, when Scott courageously took the  brief, made himself in one night master of its voluminous intricacies,  and triumphed. From this time he gained confidence, and his forensic  reputation soon became established. He was much aided by the  encouragement which he received from Lord Thurlow, who praised his  abilities, and is said to have offered him a mastership in Chancery,  which Mr. Scott declined.        [1] Tait's Edinburgh Magazine for the present month.        [2] At this school also were educated Vice-Admiral Lord      Collingwood; Sir Robert Chambers; William Elstob, an antiquary      and divine; the poet, Akenside; the Rev. George Hall, Bishop      of Dromore; and the Rev. John Brand, author of a history of      Newcastle, and secretary to the Society of Antiquaries; all of      whom were born at Newcastle.    In 1783; Mr. Scott obtained a silk gown; and, through Lord Weymouth's  interest, he was introduced into parliament for the borough of Weobly.  It is stated that on the latter occasion, he stipulated for the  liberty of voting as he pleased. He took a decided part with the Pitt  administration; and in 1788, he was appointed solicitor-general,  and knighted; in 1793, he rose to be attorney-general, and in the  following year he conducted the trial of Hardy, Tooke, and Thelwall,  for treason. Erskine was opposed to him; and the prosecution failed,  though the speech of the attorney-general occupied nine hours in the  delivery.    In 1799, Sir John Scott was appointed to the chief justiceship of the  Common Pleas, on the resignation of Chief Justice Eyre; and in the  same year he was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Eldon. In  1801, he was made Lord Chancellor, which high office he retained till  the year 1827, with the exception of the short period during which the  Whigs were in office, in 1806. His lordship was raised to the dignity  of an earl at the coronation of George IV. in 1821.    The high character of the Earl of Eldon as Chancellor is thus lucidly  drawn by Sir Egerton Brydges: \"Of all who, in the long lapse of ages,  have filled the sacred seat on which he now (1823) sits, none ever  had purer hands, none ever had a conscientious desire of equity more  ardent and more incessant than Lord Eldon. The amazing expanse of  his views, the inexpressible niceness of his discrimination, his  unrelaxing anxiety to do justice in every individual case, the  kindness of his heart, and the ductility of his ideas, all ensure that  attention to every suitor which must necessarily obtain the unbounded  admiration and attachment of the virtuous and the wise. Lord Eldon's  eloquence,\" continues Sir Egerton, \"is rather adapted to cultivated  and thinking minds than to a popular audience. It generally addresses  the understanding rather than the fancy. It frequently wants fluency,  but occasionally is tinged with a high degree of moral pathos.\"    We could illustrate the conscientious character alluded to by the  above writer, with anecdotes of the chancellorship of Lord Eldon. As  the following have, we believe, but once appeared in print, they may  not, be familiar to the reader. Sir Richard Phillips relates:[3] \"In  conversation with Mr. Butterman, (at Dronfield), I heard two anecdotes  of Lord Eldon, which, as an example to Lord Chancellors, and to  public spirited parishioners, I consider it my duty to introduce. The  incumbent, some years ago, thought proper to propose an exchange with  an incompetent clergyman; when Mr. B., as a friend to the church, and  some of his respectable neighbours took alarm at the negotiation, and  in the commencement he penned a letter to the Chancellor. The other  parties calculated on the arrangement, but, on applying to the  Chancellor he could consent to no exchange, but that if the parties  were tired of their positions, they might respectively resign, and  there were plenty of candidates. The determination was final, and the  scheme of exchange was abandoned. In another instance, a master  had been regularly appointed to the grammar school at Dronfield,  on liberal principles of education, but, within a few years, some  prejudice was excited against him, and the churchwardens for the time  thought proper to stop his salary. On this occasion, Mr. B. and some  friends combined in an application to Lord Eldon, and his lordship  instantly directed the churchwardens to render an account of the trust  within a few days. They claimed time, and were allowed a month, when,  without other form, he directed the salary to be paid to the appointed  master, with all expenses.\"        [3] In his Personal Tour through the United Kingdom, Part iii.    Newcastle contains memorials of Lord Eldon which indicate that  the inhabitants are proud of their distinguished fellow-freeman. A  spacious range of elegant buildings is called Eldon Square: and in the  Guildhall is a portrait of his lordship, opposite that of his brother,  Lord Stowell.           *       *       *       *       *      THE WEARIED SOLDIER.        \"When silent time, wi' lightly foot,      Had trod o'er thirty years,    I sought again, my native land,      Wi' many hopes and fears.\"                          MRS. HAMILTON.      He came to the village, when the sun      In the \"golden west\" was bright,    When sounds were dying one by one,      And the vesper star was shining down,    With a soft and silvery light.      A war-worn wanderer was he,      And absent many a year    From the cottage-home he fain would see,      From that resting-place where he would be,    The spot to memory dear.      It rose at last upon his view,      (Old times were thronging round him,)    The lattice where the jasmine grew,      The meadow where he brush'd the dew    When youth's bright hopes were round him.      But faces new, and sadly strange,      Were in that cottage now;    Cold eyes, that o'er his features range,      For time had wrought a weary change    Upon the soldier's brow.
