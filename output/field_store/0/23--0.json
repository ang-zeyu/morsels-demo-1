Or at least so thought Tarzan of the Apes, who squatted  upon a low-swinging branch in a near-by tree and looked down upon her.    Just to have seen him there, lolling upon the swaying bough of the  jungle-forest giant, his brown skin mottled by the brilliant equatorial  sunlight which percolated through the leafy canopy of green above him,  his clean-limbed body relaxed in graceful ease, his shapely head partly  turned in contemplative absorption and his intelligent, gray eyes  dreamily devouring the object of their devotion, you would have thought  him the reincarnation of some demigod of old.    You would not have guessed that in infancy he had suckled at the breast  of a hideous, hairy she-ape, nor that in all his conscious past since  his parents had passed away in the little cabin by the landlocked  harbor at the jungle's verge, he had known no other associates than the  sullen bulls and the snarling cows of the tribe of Kerchak, the great  ape.    Nor, could you have read the thoughts which passed through that active,  healthy brain, the longings and desires and aspirations which the sight  of Teeka inspired, would you have been any more inclined to give  credence to the reality of the origin of the ape-man. For, from his  thoughts alone, you could never have gleaned the truth--that he had  been born to a gentle English lady or that his sire had been an English  nobleman of time-honored lineage.    Lost to Tarzan of the Apes was the truth of his origin.  That he was  John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, with a seat in the House of Lords, he did  not know, nor, knowing, would have understood.    Yes, Teeka was indeed beautiful!    Of course Kala had been beautiful--one's mother is always that--but  Teeka was beautiful in a way all her own, an indescribable sort of way  which Tarzan was just beginning to sense in a rather vague and hazy  manner.    For years had Tarzan and Teeka been play-fellows, and Teeka still  continued to be playful while the young bulls of her own age were  rapidly becoming surly and morose.  Tarzan, if he gave the matter much  thought at all, probably reasoned that his growing attachment for the  young female could be easily accounted for by the fact that of the  former playmates she and he alone retained any desire to frolic as of  old.    But today, as he sat gazing upon her, he found himself noting the  beauties of Teeka's form and features--something he never had done  before, since none of them had aught to do with Teeka's ability to race  nimbly through the lower terraces of the forest in the primitive games  of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan's fertile brain evolved.  Tarzan scratched his head, running his fingers deep into the shock of  black hair which framed his shapely, boyish face--he scratched his head  and sighed.  Teeka's new-found beauty became as suddenly his despair.  He envied her the handsome coat of hair which covered her body.  His  own smooth, brown hide he hated with a hatred born of disgust and  contempt.  Years back he had harbored a hope that some day he, too,  would be clothed in hair as were all his brothers and sisters; but of  late he had been forced to abandon the delectable dream.    Then there were Teeka's great teeth, not so large as the males, of  course, but still mighty, handsome things by comparison with Tarzan's  feeble white ones.  And her beetling brows, and broad, flat nose, and  her mouth! Tarzan had often practiced making his mouth into a little  round circle and then puffing out his cheeks while he winked his eyes  rapidly; but he felt that he could never do it in the same cute and  irresistible way in which Teeka did it.    And as he watched her that afternoon, and wondered, a young bull ape  who had been lazily foraging for food beneath the damp, matted carpet  of decaying vegetation at the roots of a near-by tree lumbered  awkwardly in Teeka's direction.  The other apes of the tribe of Kerchak  moved listlessly about or lolled restfully in the midday heat of the  equatorial jungle.  From time to time one or another of them had passed  close to Teeka, and Tarzan had been uninterested.  Why was it then that  his brows contracted and his muscles tensed as he saw Taug pause beside  the young she and then squat down close to her?    Tarzan always had liked Taug.  Since childhood they had romped  together.  Side by side they had squatted near the water, their quick,  strong fingers ready to leap forth and seize Pisah, the fish, should  that wary denizen of the cool depths dart surfaceward to the lure of  the insects Tarzan tossed upon the face of the pool.    Together they had baited Tublat and teased Numa, the lion.  Why, then,  should Tarzan feel the rise of the short hairs at the nape of his neck  merely because Taug sat close to Teeka?    It is true that Taug was no longer the frolicsome ape of yesterday.  When his snarling-muscles bared his giant fangs no one could longer  imagine that Taug was in as playful a mood as when he and Tarzan had  rolled upon the turf in mimic battle.  The Taug of today was a huge,  sullen bull ape, somber and forbidding.  Yet he and Tarzan never had  quarreled.    For a few minutes the young ape-man watched Taug press closer to Teeka.  He saw the rough caress of the huge paw as it stroked the sleek  shoulder of the she, and then Tarzan of the Apes slipped catlike to the  ground and approached the two.    As he came his upper lip curled into a snarl, exposing his fighting  fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest.  Taug looked  up, batting his blood-shot eyes.  Teeka half raised herself and looked  at Tarzan.  Did she guess the cause of his perturbation? Who may say?  At any rate, she was feminine, and so she reached up and scratched Taug  behind one of his small, flat ears.    Tarzan saw, and in the instant that he saw, Teeka was no longer the  little playmate of an hour ago; instead she was a wondrous thing--the  most wondrous in the world--and a possession for which Tarzan would  fight to the death against Taug or any other who dared question his  right of proprietorship.    Stooped, his muscles rigid and one great shoulder turned toward the  young bull, Tarzan of the Apes sidled nearer and nearer.  His face was  partly averted, but his keen gray eyes never left those of Taug, and as  he came, his growls increased in depth and volume.    Taug rose upon his short legs, bristling.  His fighting fangs were  bared.  He, too, sidled, stiff-legged, and growled.    \"Teeka is Tarzan's,\" said the ape-man, in the low gutturals of the  great anthropoids.    \"Teeka is Taug's,\" replied the bull ape.    Thaka and Numgo and Gunto, disturbed by the growlings of the two young  bulls, looked up half apathetic, half interested.  They were sleepy,  but they sensed a fight.  It would break the monotony of the humdrum  jungle life they led.    Coiled about his shoulders was Tarzan's long grass rope, in his hand  was the hunting knife of the long-dead father he had never known.  In  Taug's little brain lay a great respect for the shiny bit of sharp  metal which the ape-boy knew so well how to use.  With it had he slain  Tublat, his fierce foster father, and Bolgani, the gorilla.  Taug knew  these things, and so he came warily, circling about Tarzan in search of  an opening.  The latter, made cautious because of his lesser bulk and  the inferiority of his natural armament, followed similar tactics.    For a time it seemed that the altercation would follow the way of the  majority of such differences between members of the tribe and that one  of them would finally lose interest and wander off to prosecute some  other line of endeavor.  Such might have been the end of it had the  CASUS BELLI been other than it was; but Teeka was flattered at the  attention that was being drawn to her and by the fact that these two  young bulls were contemplating battle on her account.  Such a thing  never before had occurred in Teeka's brief life.  She had seen other  bulls battling for other and older shes, and in the depth of her wild  little heart she had longed for the day when the jungle grasses would  be reddened with the blood of mortal combat for her fair sake.    So now she squatted upon her haunches and insulted both her admirers  impartially.  She hurled taunts at them for their cowardice, and called  them vile names, such as Histah, the snake, and Dango, the hyena.  She  threatened to call Mumga to chastise them with a stick--Mumga, who was  so old that she could no longer climb and so toothless that she was  forced to confine her diet almost exclusively to bananas and grub-worms.    The apes who were watching heard and laughed.  Taug was infuriated.  He  made a sudden lunge for Tarzan, but the ape-boy leaped nimbly to one  side, eluding him, and with the quickness of a cat wheeled and leaped  back again to close quarters.  His hunting knife was raised above his  head as he came in, and he aimed a vicious blow at Taug's neck.  The  ape wheeled to dodge the weapon so that the keen blade struck him but a  glancing blow upon the shoulder.    The spurt of red blood brought a shrill cry of delight from Teeka.  Ah,  but this was something worth while!  She glanced about to see if others  had witnessed this evidence of her popularity.

In the actual labor  of mining, the mighty arms and tireless back Of Quade had been a  treasure. For knowledge of camping, hunting, cooking, and all the lore  of the trail, Lowrie stood as a valuable resource; and Sandersen was  the dreamy, resolute spirit, who had hoped for gold in those mountains  until he came to believe his hope. He had gathered these three  stalwarts to help him to his purpose, and if he lived he would lead yet  others to failure.    Hope never died in this tall, gaunt man, with a pale-blue eye the color  of the horizon dusted with the first morning mist. He was the very  spirit of lost causes, full of apprehensions, foreboding,  superstitions. A hunch might make him journey five hundred miles; a  snort of his horse could make him give up the trail and turn back.    But Hal Sinclair was the antidote for Sandersen. He was still a boy at  thirty--big, handsome, thoughtless, with a heart as clean as new snow.  His throat was so parched by that day's ride that he dared not open his  lips to sing, as he usually did. He compromised by humming songs new  and old, and when his companions cursed his noise, he contented himself  with talking softly to his horse, amply rewarded when the pony  occasionally lifted a tired ear to the familiar voice.    Failure and fear were the blight on the spirit of the rest. They had  found no gold worth looking at twice, and, lingering too long in the  search, they had rashly turned back on a shortcut across the desert.  Two days before, the blow had fallen. They found Sawyer's water hole  nearly dry, just a little pool in the center, with caked, dead mud all  around it. They drained that water dry and struck on. Since then the  water famine had gained a hold on them; another water hole had not a  drop in it. Now they could only aim at the cool, blue mockery of the  mountains before them, praying that the ponies would last to the  foothills.    Still Hal Sinclair could sing softly to his horse and to himself; and,  though his companions cursed his singing, they blessed him for it in  their hearts. Otherwise the white, listening silence of the desert  would have crushed them; otherwise the lure of the mountains would have  maddened them and made them push on until the horses would have died  within five miles of the labor; otherwise the pain in their slowly  swelling throats would have taken their reason. For thirst in the  desert carries the pangs of several deaths--death from fire,  suffocation, and insanity.    No wonder the three scowled at Hal Sinclair when he drew his revolver.    \"My horse is gun-shy,\" he said, \"but I'll bet the rest of you I can  drill a horn off that skull before you do.\"    Of course it was a foolish challenge. Lowrie was the gun expert of the  party. Indeed he had reached that dangerous point of efficiency with  firearms where a man is apt to reach for his gun to decide an argument.  Now Lowrie followed the direction of Sinclair's gesture. It was the  skull of a steer, with enormous branching horns. The rest of the  skeleton was sinking into the sands.    \"Don't talk fool talk,\" said Lowrie. \"Save your wind and your  ammunition. You may need 'em for yourself, son!\"    That grim suggestion made Sandersen and Quade shudder. But a grin  spread on the broad, ugly face of Lowrie, and Sinclair merely shrugged  his shoulders.    \"I'll try you for a dollar.\"    \"Nope.\"    \"Five dollars?\"    \"Nope.\"    \"You're afraid to try, Lowrie!\"    It was a smiling challenge, but Lowrie flushed. He had a childish pride  in his skill with weapons.    \"All right, kid. Get ready!\"    He brought a Colt smoothly into his hand and balanced it dexterously,  swinging it back and forth between his eyes and the target to make  ready for a snap shot.    \"Ready!\" cried Hal Sinclair excitedly.    Lowrie's gun spoke first, and it was the only one that was fired, for  Sinclair's horse was gun-shy indeed. At the explosion he pitched  straight into the air with a squeal of mustang fright and came down  bucking. The others forgot to look for the results of Lowrie's shot.  They reined their horses away from the pitching broncho disgustedly.  Sinclair was a fool to use up the last of his mustang's strength in  this manner. But Hal Sinclair had forgotten the journey ahead. He was  rioting in the new excitement cheering the broncho to new exertions.  And it was in the midst of that flurry of action that the great blow  fell. The horse stuck his right forefoot into a hole.    To the eyes of the others it seemed to happen slowly. The mustang was  halted in the midst of a leap, tugged at a leg that seemed glued to the  ground, and then buckled suddenly and collapsed on one side. They heard  that awful, muffled sound of splintering bone and then the scream of  the tortured horse.    But they gave no heed to that. Hal Sinclair in the fall had been pinned  beneath his mount. The huge strength of Quade sufficed to budge the  writhing mustang. Lowrie and Sandersen drew Sinclair's pinioned right  leg clear and stretched him on the sand.    It was Lowrie who shot the horse.    \"You've done a brown turn,\" said Sandersen fiercely to the prostrate  figure of Sinclair. \"Four men and three hosses. A fine partner you are,  Sinclair!\"    \"Shut up,\" said Hal. \"Do something for that foot of mine.\"    Lowrie cut the boot away dexterously and turned out the foot. It was  painfully twisted to one side and lay limp on the sand.    \"Do something!\" said Sinclair, groaning.    The three looked at him, at the dead horse, at the white-hot desert, at  the distant, blue mountains.    \"What the devil can we do? You've spoiled all our chances, Sinclair.\"    \"Ride on then and forget me! But tie up that foot before you go. I  can't stand it!\"    Silently, with ugly looks, they obeyed. Secretly every one of the three  was saying to himself that this folly of Sinclair's had ruined all  their chances of getting free from the sands alive. They looked across  at the skull of the steer. It was still there, very close. It seemed to  have grown larger, with a horrible significance. And each instinctively  put a man's skull beside it, bleached and white, with shadow eyes.  Quade did the actual bandaging of Sinclair's foot, drawing tight above  the ankle, so that some of the circulation was shut off; but it eased  the pain, and now Sinclair sat up.    \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"mighty sorry, boys!\"    There was no answer. He saw by their lowered eyes that they were hating  him. He felt it in the savage grip of their hands, as they lifted him  and put him into Quade's saddle. Quade was the largest, and it was  mutely accepted that he should be the first to walk, while Sinclair  rode. It was accepted by all except Quade, that is to say. That big man  strode beside his horse, lifting his eyes now and then to glare  remorselessly at Sinclair.    It was bitter work walking through that sand. The heel crunched into  it, throwing a strain heavily on the back of the thigh, and then the  ball of the foot slipped back in the midst of a stride. Also the labor  raised the temperature of the body incredibly. With no wind stirring it  was suffocating.    And the day was barely beginning!    Barely two hours before the sun had been merely a red ball on the edge  of the desert. Now it was low in the sky, but bitterly hot. And their  mournful glances presaged the horror that was coming in the middle of  the day.    Deadly silence fell on that group. They took their turns by the watch,  half an hour at a time, walking and then changing horses, and, as each  man took his turn on foot, he cast one long glance of hatred at  Sinclair.    He was beginning to know them for the first time. They were chance  acquaintances. The whole trip had been undertaken by him on the spur of  the moment; and, as far as lay in his cheery, thoughtless nature, he  had come to regret it. The work of the trail had taught him that he was  mismated in this company, and the first stern test was stripping the  masks from them. He saw three ugly natures, three small, cruel souls.    It came Sandersen's turn to walk.    \"Maybe I could take a turn walking,\" suggested Sinclair.    It was the first time in his life that he had had to shift any burden  onto the shoulders of another except his brother, and that was  different. Ah, how different! He sent up one brief prayer for Riley  Sinclair. There was a man who would have walked all day that his  brother might ride, and at the end of the day that man of iron would be  as fresh as those who had ridden. Moreover, there would have been no  questions, no spite, but a free giving. Mutely he swore that he would  hereafter judge all men by the stern and honorable spirit of Riley.    And then that sad offer: \"Maybe I could take a turn walking, Sandersen.  I could hold on to a stirrup and hop along some way!\"    Lowrie and Quade sneered, and Sandersen retorted fiercely: \"Shut up!  You know it ain't possible, but I ought to call your bluff.\"    He had no answer, for it was not possible. The twisted foot was a  steady torture.    In another half hour he asked for water, as they paused for Sandersen  to mount, and Lowrie to take his turn on foot. Sandersen snatched the  canteen which Quade reluctantly passed to the injured man.    \"Look here!\" said Sandersen. \"We got to split up on this. You sit there  and ride and take it easy. Me and the rest has to go through hell. You  take some of the hell yourself. You ride, but we'll have the water, and  they ain't much of it left at that!\"    Sinclair glanced helplessly at the others. Their faces were set in  stern agreement.    Slowly the sun "]]]
