TO THE CITIZENS    OF    _London_ and _Westminster_.      GENTLEMEN,    _Experience has confirm'd you in that everlasting_ Maxim, _that there is  no other way to protect the_ Innocent, _but by Punishing the_ Guilty.    _Crimes ever were, and ever must be unavoidably frequent in such  populous Cities as yours are, being the necessary Consequences, either  of the_ Wants, _or the Depravity, of the lowest part of the_ humane  _Species_.    _At this time the most flagrant Offences, as_ Burning of Dwellings;  Burglaries, _and_ Highway Robberies _abound; and_ Frauds _common_  Felonies, _and_ Forgeries _are practic'd without Number; thus not only  your Properties, but even your very Lives are every way struck at_.    _The_ Legislative Power _has not been wanting in providing necessary and  wholesome Laws against these_ Evils, _the executive part whereof  (according to your great Privileges) is lodged in your own Hands: And  the Administration hath at all times applyed proper Remedies and  Regulations to the_ Defects _which have happen'd in the_ Magistracy  _more immediately under their Jurisdiction_.    _Through the just and salutary Severities of the Magistrates, publick  excessive_ Gaming _has been in a manner Surpress'd; and some late  Examples of divine Vengeance have overtaken certain of the most  notorious lewd_ Prostitutes _of the Town, which together with the  laudable endeavours of the great and worthy_ Societies, _has given no  small check to that enormous and spreading_ Vice.    _But here's a_ Criminal _bids Defiance to your_ Laws, _and _Justice _who  declar'd and has manifested that the_ Bars _are not made that can either  keep him_ Out, _or keep him_ In, _and accordingly hath a second time  fled from the very_ Bosom Of Death.    _His History will astonish! and is not compos'd of Fiction, Fable, or  Stories plac'd at York_, Rome, _or_ Jamaica, _but_ Facts _done at your  Doors_, Facts _unheard of, altogether new, Incredible, and yet  Uncontestable_.    _He is gone once more upon his wicked Range in the World. Restless  Vengeance is pursuing, and_ Gentlemen '_tis to be hoped that she will be  assisted by your Endeavours to bring to Justice this notorious  Offender_.          THE LIFE OF    _JOHN SHEPPARD, &c._      This _John Sheppard_, a Youth both in Age and Person, tho' an old Man in  Sin; was Born in the Parish of _Stepney_ near _London_, in the Year  1702, a Son, Grandson, and great Grandson of a _Carpenter_: His Father  died when he was so very Young that he could not recollect that ever he  saw him. Thus the burthen of his Maintenance, together with his  Brother's and Sister's, lay upon the Shoulders of the Widow Mother, who  soon procured an Admittance of her Son _John_ into the _Work-House_ in  _Bishopsgate-street,_ where he continued for the space of a Year and  half, and in that time received an Education sufficient to qualifie him  for the Trade his Mother design'd him, _viz_. a _Carpenter_: Accordingly  she was recommended to Mr. _Wood_ in _Witch-Street_ near _Drury-Lane_,  as a Master capable of entertaining and instructing her Son: They agreed  and Bound he was for the space of seven Years; the Lad proved an early  proficient, had a ready and ingenious Hand, and soon became Master of  his Business, and gave entire Satisfaction to his Master Customers, and  had the Character of a very sober and orderly Boy. But alas unhappy  Youth! before he had compleated six Years of his Apprenticeship, he  commenced a fatal Acquaintance with one _Elizabeth Lyon_, otherwise  call'd _Edgworth Bess_, from a Town of that Name in _Middlesex_ where  she was Born, the reputed Wife of a Foot Soldier, and who lived a wicked  and debauch'd Life; and our young _Carpenter_ became Enamour'd of her,  and they must Cohabit together as Man and Wife.    Now was laid the Foundation of his Ruin; _Sheppard_ grows weary of the  Yoke of Servitude, and began to dispute with his Master; telling him  that his way of Jobbing from House to House was not sufficient to  furnish him with a due Experience in his Trade; and that if he would not  set out to undertake some Buildings, he would step into the World for  better Information. Mr. _Wood_ a mild, sober, honest Man, indulg'd him;  and Mrs. _Wood_ with Tears, exhorted him against the Company of this  lewd Prostitute: But her Man prompted and harden'd by his HARLOT, D---  n'd _her Blood_, and threw a Stick at his Mistress, and beat her to the  Ground. And being with his Master at Work at Mr. _Britt's_ the _Sun_  Ale-house near _Islington_, upon a very trivial Occasion fell upon his  Master, and beat and bruised him in a most barbarous and shameful  Manner. Such a sudden and deplorable Change was there in the Behaviour  of this promising young Man. Next ensued a neglect of Duty, both to God  and his Master, lying out of Nights, perpetual Jarrings, and  Animosities; these and such like, were the Consequences of his intimacy  with this she _Lyon_; who by the sequel will appear to have been a main  loadstone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt.    Mr. _Wood_ having Reason to suspect, that _Sheppard_ had robb'd a  Neighbour, began to be in great Fear and Terror for himself. And when  his Man came not Home in due season at Nights bar'd him out; but he made  a mere jest of the Locks and Bolts, and enter'd in, and out at Pleasure;  and when Mr. _Wood_ and his Wife have had all the Reason in the World to  believe him Lock't out, they have found him very quiet in his Bed the  next Morning, such was the power of his early Magick.    _Edgworth Bess_ having stol'n a Gold Ring from a Gentleman, whom she had  pick'd up in the Streets, was sent to St. _Giles's_ Round-house;  _Sheppard_ went immediately to his Consort, and after a short Discourse  with Mr. _Brown_ the Beadle, and his Wife, who had the Care of the  Place, he fell upon the poor old Couple, took the Keys from them, and  let his Lady out at the Door in spight of all the Out-cryes, and  Opposition they were capable of making.    About _July_ 1723, He was by his Master sent to perform a Repair, at the  House of Mr. _Bains_, a Piece-Broker in _White-Horse Yard_; he from  thence stole a Roll of Fustain, containing 24 Yards, which was  afterwards found in his Trunk. This is supposed to be the first Robbery  he ever committed and it was not long e're he Repeated another upon this  same Mr. _Bains_, by breaking into his House in the Night-time, and  taking out of the _Till_ seven Pounds in Money, and Goods to the value  of fourteen Pounds more. How he enter'd this House, was a Secret till  his being last committed to _Newgate_, when he confessed that he took up  the Iron Bars at the Cellar Window, and after he had done his Business,  he nailed them down again, so that Mr. _Bains_ never believed his House  had been broke; and an innocent Woman a Lodger in the House lay all the  while under the weight of a suspicion of committing the Robbery.    _Sheppard_ and his Master had now parted, ten Months before the  expiration of his Apprenticeship, a woeful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#1)"],[1,"Team.

J. BETTS,  _Clerk of the Southern District of New-York._      AN ESSAY ON ELOCUTION,    DESIGNED FOR THE USE OF SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE LEARNERS    BY SAMUEL KIRKHAM.    This work is mainly designed as a Reading-Book for Schools. In the first  part of it, the _principles_ of reading are developed and explained in a  scientific and _practical_ manner, and so familiarly illustrated in  their application to practical examples as to enable even the juvenile  mind very readily to comprehend their nature and character, their design  and use, and thus to acquire that high degree of excellence, both, in  reading and speaking, which all desire, but to which few attain.    The last part of the work, contains _Selections_ from the greatest  master-pieces of rhetorical and poetical composition, both ancient and  modern. Many of these selections are taken from the most elegant and  classical American authors--writers whose noble productions have already  shed an unfading lustre, and stamped immortality upon the literature of  our country.--In the select part of the work, _rhetorical marks_ are  also employed to point out the application of the principles laid down  in the first part.--The very favorable reception of the work by the  public, and its astonishingly rapid introduction into schools, since its  first publication in 1833, excites in the author the most sanguine hopes  in regard to its future success.    NOTICES.    After a careful perusal of this work, we are decidedly of opinion, that  it is the only _successful_ attempt of the kind. The rules are copious,  and the author's explanations and illustrations _are happily adapted to  the comprehension of learners_. No school should be without this book,  and it ought to find a place in the library of every gentleman who  values the attainment of a just and forcible elocution.--_Pittsburgh  Mer. April,_ 1834.    Mr. Kirkham has given rules for inflections and emphasis, and has  followed them by illustrative examples, and these by remarks upon the  inflection which he has adopted, and the reasons for his preference of  one inflection to another--a most admirable plan for such a work.  Copious examples occur in which all the various inflections and the  shades of emphasis are distinguished with great accuracy and clearness.  The catechetical appendages of each chapter, give the work new value in  a school, and the selections made for the exercise of scholars, evince  good taste and judgment. _U.S. Gazette, Philadelphia, Sept_. 17, 1834.    The Essay now before us, needs not depend on any former work of its  author for a borrowed reputation; it has intrinsic merits of its own. It  lays down principles clearly and concisely. It presents the reader with  many new and judicious selections, both in prose and poetry; and  altogether evinces great industry combined with taste and  ingenuity.--_Courier of Upper Canada, York, Oct_. 12, 1833.    Of the talent and judgment of Mr. Kirkham, we have already had occasion  to speak in terms of honest praise. His work on Elocution raises him  still higher in our estimation.--The book would be of great utility in  schools--such a one as has long been wanted; and we are glad to see it  forthcoming.--_Baltimore Visitor, July,_ 1833.    Every facility for teaching Elocution, which I have so often needed, but  never before found, is exactly furnished in this work:--principles are  clearly and concisely laid down, and _are very happily adapted to the  comprehension of the learner_. Thoroughly convinced of its utility, I  shall lose no time in introducing it into my school. _Hartford, Conn.  Aug._. 20, 1534. NATHANIEL WEBB.          RECOMMENDATIONS.    It is well known that the recommendations which generally accompany new  books have very little weight with the public. This is as it should be,  for that work which rests more on its written testimonials, than on its  intrinsic merits for support, asserts no claims to permanent patronage.  But recommendations which analyze the merits of a work, and which, by  exhibiting its prominent features in a striking light, are calculated to  carry conviction to the reader that the system recommended is  meritorious, the author is proud to have it in his power to present in  this volume. The following are _some_ of the numerous testimonials which  he has received, and for which he tenders his grateful acknowledgments  to those literary gentlemen to whose liberality and politeness he is  indebted for them. More than _six hundred_ others presented to the  author, and many of which are equally flattering with these, he has not  room to insert.           *       *       *       *       *    The following notice of this work is extracted from the \"Western  Review.\" This journal is ably conducted by the Rev. Timothy Flint,  author of \"Francis Berrian,\" \"History and Geography of the Miss.  Valley,\" and many other popular and valuable works.    We had not, at that time, seen Mr. Kirkham's \"Grammar in familiar  Lectures,\" but have since given it a cursory perusal. If we comprehend  the author's design, it is not so much to introduce new principles, as  to render more easy and intelligible those which have been long  established, and to furnish additional facilities to an accurate and  thorough knowledge of our language. In this we think he has been  successful.    It is to be expected that a modest, unassuming writer, on presenting  himself before the public tribunal as an author, will, as far as is  consistent with his plan, avail himself of the authority of such as have  written well on the subject before him. Mr. Kirkham has accordingly  followed Mr. Murray in the old beaten track of English writers on  grammar, in the general principles of his science; endeavoring, at the  same time, to avoid whatever appeared to be erroneous or absurd in the  writings of that author, and adopting an entirely new arrangement. The  most useful matter contained in the treatise of Mr. Murray, is embraced  in this; but in the definitions and rules, it is simplified, and  rendered much more intelligible. Though our author follows Mr. Murray,  in the general principles of his work, he has, in numerous instances,  differed from him, pursuing a course that appears to be his own, and  introducing some valuable improvements.    Among these may be mentioned some additional rules and explanatory notes  in syntax, the arrangement of the parts of speech, the mode of  explaining them, manner of parsing, manner of explaining some of the  pronouns, and the use of a synopsis which presents the essentials of the  science at one view, and is well calculated to afford assistance to  learners.    In his arrangement of the parts of speech, Mr. Kirkham seems to have  endeavored to follow _the order of nature;_ and we are not able to see  how he could have done better. The noun and verb, as being the most  important parts of speech, are first explained, and afterwards those  which are considered in a secondary and subordinate character. By  following this order, he has avoided the absurdity so common among  authors, of defining the minor parts before their principals, of which  they were designed to be the appendages, and has rationally prepared the  way for conducting the learner by easy advances to a correct view of the  science.    In his illustrations of the various subjects contained in his work, our  author appears to have aimed, not at a flowery style, nor at the  appearance of being learned, but at being understood. The clearness and  perspicuity of his remarks, and their application to familiar objects,  are well calculated to arrest the attention, and aid the understanding  of the pupil, and thereby to lessen the labor of the instructor. The  principles of the science _are simplified, and rendered so perfectly  easy of comprehension,_ we should think no ordinary mind, having such  help, could find them difficult. It is in this particular that the work  appears to possess its chief merit, and on this account it cannot fail  of being preferred to many others.    It gives us pleasure to remark, in reference to the success of the"]]]
