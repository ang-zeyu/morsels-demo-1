The means adopted by man to  illuminate his home at night, stamp at once his position in the scale of  civilisation. The fluid bitumen of the far East, blazing in rude vessels  of baked earth; the Etruscan lamp, exquisite in form, yet ill adapted to  its office; the whale, seal, or bear fat, filling the hut of the Esquimaux  or Lap with odour rather than light; the huge wax candle on the glittering  altar, the range of gas lamps in our streets,--all have their stories to  tell. All, if they could speak (and, after their own manner, they can),  might warm our hearts in telling, how they have ministered to man's  comfort, love of home, toil, and devotion.    Surely, among the millions of fire-worshippers and fire-users who have  passed away in earlier ages, _some_ have pondered over the mystery of  fire; perhaps some clear minds have guessed shrewdly near the truth. Think  of the time man has lived in hopeless ignorance: think that only during a  period which might be spanned by the life of one man, has the truth been  known.    Atom by atom, link by link, has the reasoning chain been forged. Some  links, too quickly and too slightly made, have given way, and been  replaced by better work; but now the great phenomena are known--the  outline is correctly and firmly drawn--cunning artists are filling in the  rest, and the child who masters these Lectures knows more of fire than  Aristotle did.    The candle itself is now made to light up the dark places of nature; the  blowpipe and the prism are adding to our knowledge of the earth's crust;  but the torch must come first.    Among the readers of this book some few may devote themselves to  increasing the stores of knowledge: the Lamp of Science _must_ burn.  \"_Alere flammam._\"    W. CROOKES.          CONTENTS.

A CANDLE: THE FLAME--ITS SOURCES--STRUCTURE--MOBILITY--BRIGHTNESS.      I purpose, in return for the honour you do us by coming to see what are  our proceedings here, to bring before you, in the course of these  lectures, the Chemical History of a Candle. I have taken this subject on a  former occasion; and were it left to my own will, I should prefer to  repeat it almost every year--so abundant is the interest that attaches  itself to the subject, so wonderful are the varieties of outlet which it  offers into the various departments of philosophy. There is not a law  under which any part of this universe is governed which does not come into  play, and is touched upon in these phenomena. There is no better, there is  no more open door by which you can enter into the study of natural  philosophy, than by considering the physical phenomena of a candle. I  trust, therefore, I shall not disappoint you in choosing this for my  subject rather than any newer topic, which could not be better, were it  even so good.    And before proceeding, let me say this also--that though our subject be so  great, and our intention that of treating it honestly, seriously, and  philosophically, yet I mean to pass away from all those who are seniors  amongst us. I claim the privilege of speaking to juveniles as a juvenile  myself. I have done so on former occasions--and, if you please, I shall do  so again. And though I stand here with the knowledge of having the words I  utter given to the world, yet that shall not deter me from speaking in the  same familiar way to those whom I esteem nearest to me on this occasion.    And now, my boys and girls, I must first tell you of what candles are  made. Some are great curiosities. I have here some bits of timber,  branches of trees particularly famous for their burning. And here you see  a piece of that very curious substance taken out of some of the bogs in  Ireland, called _candle-wood_,--a hard, strong, excellent wood, evidently  fitted for good work as a resister of force, and yet withal burning so  well that where it is found they make splinters of it, and torches, since  it burns like a candle, and gives a very good light indeed. And in this  wood we have one of the most beautiful illustrations of the general nature  of a candle that I can possibly give. The fuel provided, the means of  bringing that fuel to the place of chemical action, the regular and  gradual supply of air to that place of action--heat and light--all  produced by a little piece of wood of this kind, forming, in fact, a  natural candle.    But we must speak of candles as they are in commerce. Here are a couple of  candles commonly called dips. They are made of lengths of cotton cut off,  hung up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again and cooled,  then re-dipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round the cotton.  In order that you may have an idea of the various characters of these  candles, you see these which I hold in my hand--they are very small, and  very curious. They are, or were, the candles used by the miners in coal  mines. In olden times the miner had to find his own candles; and it was  supposed that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the fire-damp  in the coal mines as a large one; and for that reason, as well as for  economy's sake, he had candles made of this sort--20, 30, 40, or 60 to the  pound. They have been replaced since then by the steel-mill, and then by  the Davy-lamp, and other safety-lamps of various kinds. I have here a  candle that was taken out of the _Royal George_[1], it is said, by Colonel  Pasley. It has been sunk in the sea for many years, subject to the action  of salt water. It shews you how well candles may be preserved; for though  it is cracked about and broken a good deal, yet, when lighted, it goes on  burning regularly, and the tallow resumes its natural condition as soon as  it is fused.    Mr. Field, of Lambeth, has supplied me abundantly with beautiful  illustrations of the candle and its materials. I shall therefore now refer  to them. And, first, there is the suet--the fat of the ox--Russian tallow,  I believe, employed in the manufacture of these dips, which Gay Lussac, or  some one who entrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that  beautiful substance, stearin, which you see lying beside it. A candle, you  know, is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a  clean thing, and you may almost scrape off and pulverise the drops which  fall from it without soiling anything. This is the process he  adopted[2]:--The fat or tallow is first boiled with quick-lime, and made  into a soap, and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which  takes away the lime, and leaves the fat re-arranged as stearic acid,  whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time.  Glycerin--absolutely a sugar, or a substance similar to sugar--comes out  of the tallow in this chemical change. The oil is then pressed out of it;  and you see here this series of pressed cakes, shewing how beautifully the  impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on  increasing, and at last you have left that substance which is melted, and  cast into candles as here represented. The candle I have in my hand is a  stearin candle, made of stearin from tallow in the way I have told you.  Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the purified oil of the  spermaceti whale. Here also are yellow bees-wax and refined bees-wax, from  which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious substance called  paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the  bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought from Japan, since we  have forced an entrance into that out-of-the-way place--a sort of wax  which a kind friend has sent me, and which forms a new material for the  manufacture of candles.    And how are these candles made? I have told you about dips, and I will  shew you how moulds are made. Let us imagine any of these candles to be  made of materials which can be cast. \"Cast!\" you say. \"Why, a candle is a  thing that melts; and surely if you can melt it, you can cast it.\" Not so.  It is wonderful, in the progress of manufacture, and in the consideration  of the means best fitted to produce the required result, how things turn  up which one would not expect beforehand. Candles cannot always be cast. A  wax candle can never be cast. It is made by a particular process, which I  can illustrate in a minute or two: but I must not spend much time on it.  Wax is a thing which, burning so well, and melting so easily in a candle,  cannot be cast. However, let us take a material that can be cast. Here is  a frame, with a number of moulds fastened in it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],[0,"The Religions of India (#1)"],[1,"file was produced from images generously made available by the  Bibliotheque nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at  http://gallica.bnf.fr              HANDBOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS            EDITED BY MORRIS JASTROW, JR., PH.D.    _Professor of Semitic Languages  in the University of Pennsylvania_              VOLUME I              HANDBOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS              THE    RELIGIONS OF INDIA        BY        EDWARD WASHBURN HOPKINS    Ph.D. (LEIPSIC)    PROFESSOR OF SANSKRIT AND COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY IN BRYN MAWR COLLEGE                _\"This holy mystery I declare unto you:    There is nothing nobler than humanity.\"_      THE MAH[=A]BH[=A]RATA.

The growing interest both in this country and abroad in the historical  study of religions is one of the noticeable features in the  intellectual phases of the past decades. The more general indications  of this interest may be seen in such foundations as the Hibbert and  Gifford Lectureships in England, and the recent organization of an  American committee to arrange in various cities for lectures on the  history of religions, in the establishment of a special department for  the subject at the University of Paris, in the organization of the  Musee Guimet at Paris, in the publication of a journal--the _Revue de  l'Histoire des Religions_--under the auspices of this Museum, and in  the creation of chairs at the College de France, at the Universities  of Holland, and in this country at Cornell University and the  University of Chicago,[1] with the prospect of others to follow in the  near future. For the more special indications we must turn to the  splendid labors of a large array of scholars toiling in the various  departments of ancient culture--India, Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt,  Palestine, Arabia, Phoenicia, China, Greece, and Rome--with the result  of securing a firm basis for the study of the religions flourishing in  those countries--a result due mainly to the discovery of fresh sources  and to the increase of the latter brought about by exploration and  incessant research. The detailed study of the facts of religion  everywhere, both in primitive society and in advancing civilization,  and the emphasis laid upon gathering and understanding these facts  prior to making one's deductions, has succeeded in setting aside the  speculations and generalizations that until the beginning of this  century paraded under the name of \"Philosophy of Religion.\"    Such has been the scholarly activity displayed and the fertility  resulting, that it seems both desirable and timely to focus, as it  were, the array of facts connected with the religions of the ancient  world in such a manner that the summary resulting may serve as the  point of departure for further investigations.    This has been the leading thought which has suggested the series of  Handbooks on the History of Religions. The treatment of the religions  included in the series differs from previous attempts in the aim to  bring together the ascertained results of scholarship rather than to  make an additional contribution, though the character of the scholars  whose cooeperation has beep secured justifies the hope that their  productions will also mark an advance in the interpretation of the  subject assigned to each. In accord with this general aim, mere  discussion has been limited to a minimum, while the chief stress has  been laid upon the clear and full presentation of the data connected  with each religion.    A uniform plan has been drawn up by the editor for the order of  treatment in the various volumes, by following which it is hoped that  the continuous character of the series will be secured.    In this plan the needs of the general reader, as well as those of the  student, for whom, in the first place, the series is designed, have  been kept in view. After the introduction, which in the case of each  volume is to be devoted to a setting forth of the sources and the  method of study, a chapter follows on the land and the people,  presenting those ethnographical and geographical considerations,  together with a brief historical sketch of the people in question, so  essential to an understanding of intellectual and religious life  everywhere.    In the third section, which may be denominated the kernel of the book,  the subdivisions and order of presentation necessarily vary, the  division into periods being best adapted to one religion, the  geographical order for another, the grouping of themes in a logical  sequence for a third; but in every case, the range covered will be the  same, namely, the beliefs, including the pantheon, the relation to the  gods, views of life and death, the rites--both the official ones and  the popular customs--the religious literature and architecture. A  fourth section will furnish a general estimate of the religion, its  history, and the relation it bears to others. Each volume will  conclude with a full bibliography, index, and necessary maps, with  illustrations introduced into the text as called for. The Editor has  been fortunate in securing the services of distinguished specialists  whose past labors and thorough understanding of the plan and purpose  of the series furnish a guarantee for the successful execution of  their task.    It is the hope of the Editor to produce in this way a series of  manuals that may serve as text-books for the historical study of  religions in our universities and seminaries. In addition to supplying  this want, the arrangement of the manuals will, it is expected, meet  the requirements of reliable reference-books for ascertaining the  present status of our knowledge of the religions of antiquity, while  the popular manner of presentation, which it will be the aim of the  writers to carry out, justifies the hope that the general reader will  find the volumes no less attractive and interesting.

SOURCES.--DATES.--METHODS OF INTERPRETATION.--DIVISIONS OF SUBJECT.      SOURCES.      India always has been a land of religions. In the earliest Vedic  literature are found not only hymns in praise of the accepted gods,  but also doubts in regard to the worth of these gods; the beginnings  of a new religion incorporated into the earliest records of the old.  And later, when, about 300 B.C, Megasthenes was in India, the  descendants of those first theosophists are still discussing, albeit  in more modern fashion, the questions that lie at the root of all  religion. \"Of the philosophers, those that are most estimable he terms  Brahmans ([Greek: _brachmanas_]). These discuss with many words  concerning death. For they regard death as being, for the wise, a  birth into real life--into the happy life. And in many things they  hold the same opinions with the Greeks: saying that the universe was  begotten and will be destroyed, and that the world is a sphere, which  the god who made and owns it pervades throughout; that there are  different beginnings of all things, but water is the beginning of  world-making, while, in addition to the four elements, there is, as  fifth, a kind of nature, whence came the sky and the stars.... And  concerning the seed of things and the soul they have much to say also,  whereby they weave in myths, just as does Plato, in regard to the  soul's immortality, judgment in hell, and such things.\"[1]    And as India conspicuously is a country of creeds, so is its  literature preeminently priestly and religious. From the first Veda to  the last Pur[=a]na, religion forms either the subject-matter of the  most important works, or, as in the case of the epics,[2] the basis of  didactic excursions and sectarian interpolations, which impart to  worldly themes a tone peculiarly theological. History and oratory are  unknown in Indian literature. The early poetry consists of hymns and  religious poems; the early prose, of liturgies, linguistics, \"law,\"  theology, sacred legends and other works, all of which are intended to  supplement the knowledge of the Veda, to explain ceremonies, or to  inculcate religious principles. At a later date, formal grammar and  systems of philosophy, fables and commentaries are added to the prose;  epics, secular lyric, drama, the Pur[=a]nas and such writings to the  poetry. But in all this great mass, till that time which Mueller has  called the Renaissance--that is to say, till after the Hindus were  come into close contact with foreign nations, notably the Greek, from  which has been borrowed, perhaps, the classical Hindu drama,[3]--there  is no real literature that was not religious originally, or, at least,  so apt for priestly use as to become chiefly moral and theosophic;  while the most popular works of modern times are sectarian tracts,  Pur[=]nas, Tantras and remodelled worldly poetry. The sources, then,  from which is to be drawn the knowledge of Hindu religions are the  best possible--the original texts. The information furnished by  foreigners, from the times of Ktesias and Megasthenes to that of  Mandelslo, is considerable; but one is warranted in assuming that what  little in it is novel is inaccurate, since otherwise the information  would have been furnished by the"]]]
