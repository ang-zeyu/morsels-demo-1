[PRICE 2_d_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE NEW CHURCH OF ST. DUNSTAN IN THE WEST.      [Illustration: NEW CHURCH OF ST. DUNSTAN IN THE WEST, FLEET STREET.]    In our fourteenth volume we took a farewell glance of the old church of  St. Dunstan, and adverted to the proposed new structure. Little did we  then expect that within three years the removal of the old church would  be effected, and a fabric of greatly surpassing beauty raised in its  place. All this has been accomplished by the unanimity of the  parishioners of St. Dunstan, unaided by any public grant, and assisted  only by their own right spirit, integrity, and well-directed taste. The  erection of this Church, as the annexed Engraving shows, is not to be  considered merely as a parochial, but as a public, benefit, and must be  ranked among the most important of our metropolitan improvements. The  different situation of the new and the old churches will occasion an  addition of 30 feet to the width of the opposite street, and it will be  perceived by the Engraving,[1] that improvements are contemplated in the  houses adjoining the church, so as to give an _unique_ architectural  character to this portion of the line of Fleet-street.        [1] Copied, by permission, from a handsome Lithograph, published      by Mr. Waller, Fleet-street.    The church has been built from the designs and under the superintendance  of John Shaw, Esq., F.R. and A.S. the architect of Christ's Hospital.  The tower is of the Kelton stone, a very superior kind of freestone, of  beautiful colour, from the county of Rutland. Of this material King's  College Chapel, Cambridge, and many other of our finest edifices have  been constructed. The tower has below an entrance doorway, finished with  rich mouldings and tracery; on each side are the arms of his Majesty and  the City of London. Above is a clock with three dials, and a belfry to  admit the fine set of bells[2] from the old church, the sound of which  will doubtless receive effect through the four large upper windows which  are the main features of the tower. Above these windows, the tower,  hitherto square, becomes gradually octagonal, springing from corbeled  heads; till terminated by four octagonal pinnacles, and crowned by an  octagonal moulded battlement. Upon the tower is an enriched stone  lantern, perforated with gothic windows of two heights, each angle  having a buttress and enriched finial; the whole being terminated by an  ornamental, pierced, and very rich crown parapet. The height of the  tower, to the battlements, is 90 feet; and the whole height of the tower  and lantern is 130 feet.        [2] The tower of the old church was furnished with a set of      eight very excellent bells: there was also a bell of a smaller      size suspended in one of the turrets, which was rung every      morning at a quarter before seven o'clock. On the walls of the      belfry were some records of exploits in ringing, which had been      performed there on different occasions.    The body of the church is of fine brick, finished with stone, and of  octagon form, about 50 feet diameter. The interior has eight recesses;  one of these being occupied by the altar with a large pointed window  above, and three others by the organ and galleries for the children of  the parish schools: the remaining four recesses are unoccupied by  galleries; against their walls are placed the sepulchral monuments from  the old church. The octagon form was often adopted in the lady-chapels  at the east end of our most ancient cathedrals, where the recesses were  devoted to tombs and private chapels. The upper or clere story is  supported on arches, with an enriched gothic window in each compartment.  The roof springs from clustered columns, branching into an enriched  groined ceiling, with a very large and embellished pendent key-stone in  the centre, from which will be suspended the chandelier to light the  whole of the interior. The ornaments of this key-stone are of a very  elegant character: its foliated tracery, as well as the richness of the  bosses, corbels, and other embellishments throughout the interior, are  extremely beautiful. The pewing, gallery fronts, and fittings will be of  fine oak; and we learn that the altar and eight clere story windows will  be filled with painted glass. The church is calculated to hold about 900  persons.    The tower is connected with the main body by a lobby, and will front the  street, enclosed with a handsome railing. The builders of the church are  Messrs. Browne and Atkinson, of Goswell-street, London; and the pewing  and interior fittings are about to be executed by Messrs. Cubitt.           *       *       *       *       *    We could occupy a column or a page with enumerating the monumental  remains of the old church, although we have already mentioned the  principal of them. (_See Mirror_, vol. xiv. p. 145-243.) It is our  intention to return to them, even if it be but to point the attention of  the lover of parochial antiquities to a Series of Views of St. Dunstan  and its Monuments, with an Historical Account of the Church, by the Rev.  J.F. Denham; which by its concise yet satisfactory details, leads us to  wish that every parish in the metropolis were illustrated by so  accomplished an annalist.           *       *       *       *       *      ITALIAN HYMN TO THE MADONNA.        When the cypress-tree is weeping      With the bright rose o'er the tomb.    And the sunny orb is sleeping      On the mountain's brow of gloom.    Sweet mother at thy shrine      Our spirits melt in prayer,    Beneath the loveliness divine,      Which art has pictured there.      Or when the crystal star of Even      Is mirror'd in the silent sea,    And we can almost deem that heaven      Derives its calmest smile from thee.    Oh, virgin, if the lute      Invokes thy name in song,    Be thine the only voice that's mute,      Amid the tuneful throng.      When battle waves her falchion gory,      Over the dead on sea or land,    And one proud heart receives the glory,      Won by the blood of many a band,    If the hero's prayer to thee,      From his fading lips be given,    Awake his heart to ecstacy,      With brightest hopes of heaven.      Madonna! on whose bosom slumber'd,      The infant, Christ, with sunny brow,    The viewless hours have pass'd unnumber'd,      Since we adored thy shrine as now;    But not the gorgeous sky,      Nor the blue expansive sea,    To us such beauty could supply,      As that which hallow'd thee!      And when the scenes of life are faded      From our dim eyes like phantom-things,    When gentlest hearts with gloom are shaded,      And cease to thrill at Fancy's strings,    _Thou_, like the rainbow's form,      When summer skies are dark,    Shalt give thy light amid the storm,      And guide the Wanderer's bark!

We ought not perhaps to insist too much on the opinions of the heathen  philosophers, because the extension of knowledge, and a more matured  experience, has shown the fallacy of many of their notions; but if we  were permitted to lay any stress on the authority of these celebrated  men, we might bring forward a mine of classical learning in commendation  of a vegetable diet; we might point to the life of a Pythagoras, or a  Seneca, as well as to the works of a Plato, and show how the wisest  among the ancients lived, as well as thought, with regard to this  subject.    But we shall be contented, as far as authority is concerned, to rest our  claims to attention, rather upon that which bears a more modern date,  and to bring forward the evidence of facts instead of the theories of  ingenuity. The subject itself we may venture to hope, though a little  homely, is not without interest, and certainly not unimportant. It is  somewhat scientific from its very nature, and so far from being a matter  confined to the medical faculty, it is one on which every man exerts,  every day of his existence, his own free choice, as far indeed as custom  has allowed him the exercise of that freedom.    But, though we will not go back to the dreams of our forefathers, (who,  if they had more genius, had fewer materials for it to work upon than  their servile children,) yet we must always make the Bible an exception,  and in the present case we find it expedient as well as becoming, to  refer to that oldest and most valuable of records. We have there no  express mention of eating flesh before the Flood; but, on the contrary,  a direct command that man should subsist on the fruits of the earth.  (\"Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face  of the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree  yielding seed; to _you it shall be for meat_\"--Gen. i. 29.)    After the Flood, when the Israelites were distressed for want of food in  the Wilderness, we find that it was sent to them from heaven in a  vegetable form, and to denote its divine origin and its superior  excellency, it is called in the Scriptures \"the corn of heaven,\" and  \"angels' food,\" &c. Oftener than once this favoured but ungrateful  people despised and loathed this miraculous provision; they called out  for animal food, and accordingly quails were sent them, but they were  punished with destruction by the flesh which they desired; (\"And while  the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of  the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people  with a very great plague.\"--Numb. xi. 33.)

The electric railway recently set in operation between Frankfort and  Offenbach furnishes an occasion for studying the question of such roads  anew and from a practical standpoint. For elevated railways Messrs.  Siemens and Halske a long time ago chose rails as current conductors. The  electric railway from Berlin to Lichterfelde and the one at Vienna are in  reality only elevated roads established upon the surface.    Although it is possible to insulate the rails in a satisfactory manner in  the case of an elevated road, the conditions of insulation are not very  favorable where the railway is to be constructed on a level with the  surface. In this case it becomes necessary to dispense with the simple and  cheap arrangement of rails as conductors, and to set up, instead, a number  of poles to support the electric conductors. It is from these latter that  certain devices of peculiar construction take up the current. The simplest  arrangement to be adopted under these circumstances would evidently be to  stretch a wire upon which a traveler would slide--this last named piece  being connected with the locomotive by means of a flexible cord. This  general idea, moreover, has been put in practice by several constructors.    In the Messrs. Siemens Bros.' electric railway that figured at Paris in  1881 the arrangement adopted for taking up the current consisted of two  split tubes from which were suspended two small contact carriages that  communicated with the electric car through the intermedium of flexible  cables. This is the mode of construction that Messrs. Siemens and Halske  have adopted in the railway from Frankfort to Offenbach. While the Paris  road was of an entirely temporary character, that of Frankfort has been  built according to extremely well studied plans, and after much light  having been thrown upon the question of electric traction by three years  of new experiments.    Fig. 1 shows the electric car at the moment of its start from Frankfort,  Fig. 2 shows the arrangement of a turnout, and Fig. 3 gives a general plan  of the electric works.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY, FRANKFORT, GERMANY.]    The two grooved tubes are suspended from insulators fixed upon external  cast iron supports. As for the conductors, which have their resting points  upon ordinary insulators mounted at the top of the same supports, these  are cables composed of copper and steel. They serve both for leading the  current and carrying the tubes. The same arrangement was used by Messrs.  Siemens and Halske at Vienna in 1883.    The motors, which are of 240 H.P., consist of two coupled steam engines of  the Collmann system. The one shaft in common runs with a velocity of 60  revolutions per minute. Its motion is transmitted by means of ten hempen  cables, 3.5 cm. in diameter. The flywheel, which is 4 m. in diameter,  serves at the same time as a driving pulley. As the pulley mounted upon  the transmitting shaft is only one meter in diameter, it follows that the  shafting has a velocity of 240 revolutions per minute. The steam  generators are of the Ten Brink type, and are seven in number. The normal  pressure in them is four atmospheres. There are at present four  dynamo-electric machines, but sufficient room was provided for four more.  The shafts of the dynamos have a velocity of 600 revolutions per minute.  The pulleys are 60 cm. in diameter, and the width of the driving belts is  18 cm. The dynamos are mounted upon rails so as to permit the tension of  the belting to be regulated when necessity requires it. This arrangement,  which possesses great advantages, had already been adopted in many other  installations.    The electric machines are 2 meters in height. The diameter of the rings is  about 45 cm. and their length is 70 cm. The electric tension of the  dynamos measures 600 volts.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--TURNOUT TRACK OF THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY, FRANKFORT,  GERMANY.]    The duty varies between 80 and 50 per cent., according to the arrangement  of the cars. The total length of the road is 6,655 meters. Usually, there  are four cars _en route_, and two dynamos serve to create the current.  When the cars are coupled in pairs, three dynamos are used--one of the  machines being always held in reserve. All the dynamos are grouped for  quantity.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--GENERAL PLAN OF THE ELECTRIC WORKS.]    The company at present owns six closed and five open cars. In the former  there is room for twenty-two persons. The weight of these cars varies  between 3,500 and 4,000 kilos.--_La Lumiere Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *      By the addition of ten parts of collodion to fifteen of creasote (says the  _Revue de Therap._) a sort of jelly is obtained which is more convenient  to apply to decayed teeth than is creasote in its liquid form.           *       *       *       *       *          POSSIBILITIES OF THE TELEPHONE.      The meeting of the American Association was one of unusual interest and  importance to the members of Section B. This is to be attributed not only  to the unusually large attendance of American physicists, but also to the  presence of a number of distinguished members of the British Association,  who have contributed to the success of the meetings not only by presenting  papers, but by entering freely into the discussions. In particular the  section was fortunate in having the presence of Sir William Thomson, to  whom more than to any one else we owe the successful operation of the  great ocean cables, and who stands with Helmholtz first among living  physicists. Whenever he entered any of the discussions, all were benefited  by the clearness and suggestiveness of his remarks.    Professor A. Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, read a paper  giving a possible method of communication between ships at sea. The simple  experiment that illustrates the method which he proposed is as follows:  Take a basin of water, introduce into it, at two widely separated points,  the two terminals of a battery circuit which contains an interrupter,  making and breaking the circuit very rapidly. Now at two other points  touch the water with the terminals of a circuit containing a telephone. A  sound will be heard, except when the two telephone terminals touch the  water at points where the potential is the same. In this way the  equipotential lines can easily be picked out. Now to apply this to the  case of a ship at sea: Suppose one ship to be provided with a dynamo  machine generating a powerful current, and let one terminal enter the  water at the prow of the ship, and the other to be carefully insulated,  except at its end, and be trailed behind the ship, making connection with  the sea at a considerable distance from the vessel; and suppose the  current be rapidly made and broken by an interrupter; then the observer on  a second vessel provided with similar terminal conductors to the first,  but having a telephone instead of a dynamo, will be able to detect the  presence of the other vessel even at a considerable distance; and by  suitable modifications the direction of the other vessel may be found.  This conception Professor Bell has actually tried on the Potomac River  with two small boats, and found that at a mile and a quarter, the furthest  distance experimented upon, the sound due to the action of the interrupter  in one boat was distinctly audible in the other.
