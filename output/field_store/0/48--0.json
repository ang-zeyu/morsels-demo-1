CHAPTER I.      THE CAUSE OF THE WAR WITH SPAIN.    Many causes led up to the Spanish-American war. Cuba had been in  a state of turmoil for a long time, and the continual reports of  outrages on the people of the island by Spain greatly aroused the  Americans. The \"ten years war\" had terminated, leaving the island much  embarrassed in its material interests, and woefully scandalized by the  methods of procedure adopted by Spain and principally carried out  by Generals Campos and Weyler, the latter of whom was called the  \"butcher\" on account of his alleged cruelty in attempting to suppress  the former insurrection. There was no doubt much to complain of under  his administration, for which the General himself was not personally  responsible. He boasted that he only had three individuals put to  death, and that in each of these cases he was highly justified by  martial law.    FINALLY THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES was forcibly attracted to  Cuba by the Virginius affair, which consisted in the wanton murder of  fifty American sailors--officers and crew of the Virginius, which was  captured by the Spanish off Santiago bay, bearing arms and ammunition  to the insurgents--Captain Fry, a West Point graduate, in command.    Spain would, no doubt, have received a genuine American thrashing on  this occasion had she not been a republic at that time, and President  Grant and others thought it unwise to crush out her republican  principles, which then seemed just budding into existence.    The horrors of this incident, however, were not out of the minds of  the American people when the new insurrection of 1895 broke out. At  once, as if by an electric flash, the sympathy of the American people  was enlisted with the Insurgents who were (as the Americans believed)  fighting Spain for their _liberty_. Public opinion was on the  Insurgents' side and against Spain from the beginning. This feeling of  sympathy for the fighting Cubans knew no North nor South; and strange  as it may seem the Southerner who quails before the mob spirit that  disfranchises, ostracises and lynches an American Negro who seeks his  liberty at home, became a loud champion of the Insurgent cause in  Cuba, which was, in fact, the cause of Cuban Negroes and mulattoes.    GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE, of Virginia, possibly the most noted Southerner  of the day, was sent by President Cleveland to Havana as Consul  General, and seemed proud of the honor of representing his government  there, judging from his reports of the Insurgents, which were  favorable. General Lee was retained at his post by President McKinley  until it became necessary to recall him, thus having the high honor  paid him of not being changed by the new McKinley administration,  which differed from him in politics; and as evidence of General  Fitzhugh Lee's sympathy with the Cubans it may be cited that he sent  word to the Spanish Commander (Blanco) on leaving Havana that he would  return to the island again and when he came he \"would bring the stars  and stripes in front of him.\"    BELLIGERENT RIGHTS TO THE INSURGENTS OR NEUTRALITY became the topic of  discussion during the close of President Cleveland's administration.  The President took the ground that the Insurgents though deserving of  proper sympathy, and such aid for humanity's sake as could be given  them, yet they had not established on any part of the island such a  form of government as could be recognized at Washington, and accorded  belligerent rights or rights of a nation at war with another nation;  that the laws of neutrality should be strictly enforced, and America  should keep \"hands off\" and let Spain and the Insurgents settle their  own differences.    [Illustration: GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE.]    MUCH MONEY AND TIME was expended by the United States government in  maintaining this neutral position. Fillibustering expeditions were  constantly being fitted up in America with arms and ammunition for the  Cuban patriots. As a neutral power it became the duty of the American  government to suppress fillibustering, but it was both an unpleasant  and an expensive duty, and one in which the people had little or no  sympathy.    SPAIN TRIES TO APPEASE public sentiment in America by recalling  Marshal Campos, who was considered unequal to the task of defeating  the Insurgents, because of reputed inaction. The flower of the Spanish  army was poured into Cuba by the tens of thousands--estimated, all  told, at three hundred thousand when the crisis between America and  Spain was reached.    WEYLER THE \"BUTCHER,\" was put in command and inaugurated the policy of  establishing military zones inside of the Spanish lines, into which  the unarmed farmers, merchants, women and children were driven,  penniless; and being without any visible means of subsistence were  left to perish from hunger and disease. (The condition of these people  greatly excited American sympathy with the Insurgents.) General Weyler  hoped thus to weaken the Insurgents who received considerable of  supplies from this class of the population, either by consent or  force. Weyler's policy in reference to the reconcentrados (as these  non-combatant people were called) rather increased than lessened  the grievance as was natural to suppose, in view of the misery and  suffering it entailed on a class of people who most of all were not  the appropriate subjects for his persecution, and sentiment became so  strong in the United States against this policy (especially in view of  the fact that General Weyler had promised to end the \"Insurrection\" in  three months after he took command) that in FEBRUARY, 1896, the United  States Congress took up the discussion of the matter. Several Senators  and Congressmen returned from visits to the island pending this  discussion, in which they took an active and effective part, depicting  a most shocking and revolting situation in Cuba, for which Spain  was considered responsible; and on April 6th following this joint  resolution was adopted by Congress:    \"_Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America_, that in the opinion of Congress a public  war exists between the Government of Spain and the Government  proclaimed and for some time maintained by force of arms by the people  of Cuba; and that the United States of America should maintain a  strict neutrality between the contending powers, according to each all  the rights of belligerents in the ports and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11112"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration: Macclesfield Bridge, Regent's Park.]        MACCLESFIELD BRIDGE.      This picturesque structure crosses the Canal towards the Northern verge  of the Regent's Park; and nearly opposite to it is a road leading to  Primrose Hill, as celebrated in the annals of Cockayne as was the  Palatino among the ancient Romans.    The bridge was built from the designs of Mr. Morgan, and its  construction is considered to be \"appropriate and architectural.\" Its  piers are formed by cast-iron columns, of the Grecian Doric order, from  which spring the arches, covering the towing-path, the canal itself, and  the southern bank. The _abacus_, or top of the columns, the mouldings or  ornaments of the capitals, and the frieze, are in exceeding good taste,  as are the ample shafts. The supporters of the roadway, likewise,  correspond with the order; although, says Mr. Elmes, the architect,  \"fastidious critics may object to the dignity of the pure ancient Doric  being violated by degrading it into supporters of modern arches.\" The  centre arch is appropriated to the canal and the towing-path, and the  two external arches to foot-passengers, and as communications to the  road above them. Mr. Elmes[1] sums up the merits of the bridge as  follows:--\"It has a beautiful and light appearance, and is an  improvement in execution upon a design of Perronet's for an  _architectural_ bridge, that is, a bridge of _orders_. The columns are  well proportioned, and suitably robust, carrying solidity, grace, and  beauty in every part; from the massy grandeur of the abacus, to the  graceful revolving of the beautiful echinus, and to the majestic  simplicity of the slightly indented flutings.\" He then suggests certain  improvements in the design, which would have made the bridge  \"unexceptionably the most novel and the most tasteful in the metropolis.  Even as it is, it is scarcely surpassed for lightness, elegance, and  originality by any in Europe. It is of the same family with the  beautiful little bridge in Hyde Park, between the new entrance and the  barracks.\"    We are happy to quote the above praise on the construction of  _Macclesfield Bridge_, inasmuch as a critical notice of many of the  structures in the Regent's Park would subject them to much severe and  merited censure. The forms of bridges admit, perhaps, of more display of  taste than any other species of ornamental architecture, and of a  greater means of contributing to the picturesque beauty of the  surrounding scenery.

Now to their love and worth of every kind,    A soft compunction turns the afflicted mind;    Virtues neglected then, adored become,    And graces slighted, blossom on the tomb.\"    CRABBE.      \"It was the early wish of Pope,\" says Dr. Knox, \"that when he died, not  a stone might tell where he lay. It is a wish that will commonly be  granted with reluctance. The affection of those whom we leave behind us  is at a loss for methods to display its wonted solicitude, and seeks  consolation under sorrow, in doing honour to all that remains. It is  natural that filial piety, parental tenderness, and conjugal love,  should mark, with some fond memorial, the clay-cold spot where the form,  still fostered in the bosom, moulders away. And did affection go no  farther, who could censure? But, in recording the virtues of the  departed, either zeal or vanity leads to an excess perfectly ludicrous.  A marble monument, with an inscription palpably false and ridiculously  pompous, is far more offensive to true taste, than the wooden memorial  of the rustic, sculptured with painted bones, and decked out with  death's head in all the colours of the rainbow. There is an elegance and  a classical simplicity in the turf-clad heap of mould which covers the  poor man's grave, though it has nothing to defend it from the insults of  the proud but a bramble. The primrose that grows upon it is a better  ornament than the gilded lies on the oppressor's tombstone.\"    The Greeks had a custom of bedecking tombs with herbs and flowers, among  which parsley was chiefly in use, as appears from Plutarch's story of  Timoleon, who, marching up an ascent, from the top of which he might  take a view of the army and strength of the Carthaginians, was met by a  company of mules laden with parsley, which his soldiers conceived to be  a very ill boding and fatal occurrence, that being the very herb  wherewith they adorned the sepulchres of the dead. This custom gave  birth to that despairing proverb, when we pronounce of one dangerously  sick, that he has need of nothing but parsley; which is in effect to  say, he's a dead man, and ready for the grave. All sorts of purple and  white flowers were acceptable to the dead; as the amaranthus, which was  first used by the Thessalians to adorn Achilles's grave. The rose, too,  was very grateful; nor was the use of myrtle less common. In short,  graves were bedecked with garlands of all sorts of flowers, as appears  from Agamemnon's daughter in Sophocles:--        \"No sooner came I to my father's tomb,    But milk fresh pour'd in copious streams did flow,    And _flowers_ of ev'ry sort around were strow'd.\"      Several other tributes were frequently laid upon graves, as ribands;  whence it is said that Epaminondas's soldiers being disanimated at  seeing the riband that hung upon his spear carried by the wind to a  certain Lacedaemonian sepulchre, he bid them take courage, for that it  portended destruction to the Lacedaemons, it being customary to deck the  sepulchres of their dead with ribands. Another thing dedicated to the  dead was their hair. Electra, in Sophocles, says, that Agamemnon had  commanded her and Chrysosthemis to pay this honour:--        \"With drink-off'rings and _locks of hair_ we must,    According to his will, his _tomb_ adorn.\"      It was likewise customary to perfume the grave-stones with sweet  ointments, &c.    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *    SONG.    _(For the Mirror.)_        I've roam'd the thorny path of life,      And search'd abroad to find.    Amid the blooming flowers so rife,      That germ called peace of mind.    At length a lovely lily caught      My anxious, longing view,    With all the sweets of \"Heartsease\" fraught,      That fragrant flower was YOU.      Thy smile to me is Heaven divine,      Thy voice the soul of Love--    In pity, then, sweet maid, be mine,      My \"heartsease\" flow'ret prove.    Nor wealth nor power would I attain,      Though uncontrolled and free--    All other joys to me are pain,      When sever'd, love, from THEE.      ELFORD.           *       *       *       *       *    CHARLES BRANDON, AFTERWARDS DUKE OF SUFFOLK.    _(For the Mirror.)_      An event in the life of this nobleman gave Otway the plot for his  celebrated tragedy of \"The Orphan,\" though he laid the scene of his play  in Bohemia. It is recorded in the \"English Adventures,\" a very scarce  pamphlet, published in 1667, only two or three copies of which are  extant. The father of Charles Brandon retired, on the death of his lady,  to the borders of Hampshire. His family consisted of two sons, and a  young lady, the daughter of a friend, lately deceased, whom he adopted  as his own child.    This lady being singularly beautiful, as well as amiable in her manners,  attracted the affections of both the brothers. The elder, however, was  the favourite, and he privately married her; which the younger not  knowing, and overhearing an appointment of the lovers to meet the next  night in her bed-chamber, he contrived to get his brother otherwise  employed, and made the signal of admission himself, (thinking it a mere  intrigue.) Unfortunately he succeeded.    On discovery, the lady lost her reason, and soon after died. The two  brothers fought, and the elder fell. The father broke his heart a few  months afterwards. The younger brother, Charles Brandon, the  unintentional author of all this family misery, quitted England in  despair, with a fixed determination of never returning.    Being abroad for several years, his nearest relations supposed him dead,  and began to take the necessary steps for obtaining his estates; when,  roused by this intelligence, he returned privately to England, and for a  time took obscure lodgings in the vicinity of his family mansion.    While he was in this retreat, the young king, (Henry VIII.), who had  just buried his father, was one day hunting on the borders of Hampshire,  when he heard the cries of a female in distress in an adjoining wood.  His gallantry immediately summoned him to the place, though he then  happened to be detached from all his courtiers, where he saw two  ruffians attempting to violate the honour of a young lady. The king  instantly drew on them; and a scuffle ensued, which roused the _reverie_  of Charles Brandon, who was taking his morning walk in an adjoining  thicket. He immediately ranged himself on the side of the king, whom he  then did not know; and by his dexterity, soon disarmed one of the  ruffians, while the other fled.    The king, charmed with this act of gallantry, so congenial to his own  mind, inquired the name and family of the stranger; and not only  repossessed him of his patrimonial estates, but took him under his  immediate protection.    It was this same Charles Brandon who afterwards privately married  Henry's sister, Margaret, queen-dowager of France; which marriage the  king"]]]
