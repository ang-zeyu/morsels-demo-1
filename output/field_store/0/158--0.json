These men were not only contemporary with Hebbel and  Ludwig, but may indeed be called their artistic counterparts. Though  widely differentiated by individual temper and talent, these painters  and poets belong to the same phase of mid-century German literature and  art: the striving of Romanticism beyond itself, the struggle for a new  style uniting depth of feeling and terseness of delineation, the longing  for a new view of life harmonizing the worship of the past with the  demands of modern society and the problems of the day. Hence the heroic  note in the work of these painters and poets, hence their predilection  for great historical or mythological or religious subjects, hence their  leaning toward tragic conflicts in every day situations, hence their all  too conscious striving for pointed effects; hence, also, the inspiring  influence emanating from their best productions.    KUNO FRANCKE.          THE LIFE OF FRIEDRICH HEBBEL        By WILLIAM GUILD HOWARD, A.M.,    Assistant Professor of German, Harvard University      The greatest German dramatists of the middle of the nineteenth century  were Franz Grillparzer, Friedrich Hebbel, and Otto Ludwig. In a caustic  epigram written in 1855, Grillparzer set forth that Dame Poetry, for  some years a widow and now ailing, needed a husband, but could find  none; and we remember that the heroine of _Libussa_ rejects the wise  Lapak, the strong Biwoy, and the rich Domaslaw because she desires in  one man, united, the qualities which separately dominate the three. With  more charity, Grillparzer might have more fully recognized the poet in  Hebbel or Ludwig; but we may be permitted to think of these three  dramatists as not unlike the three suitors for the hand of Libussa:  Grillparzer was rich, Ludwig was wise, and Hebbel was strong. Each of  them was somewhat deficient in the qualities of the other two; each,  however, was a personality, and Hebbel one of the most powerful that  ever lived.    Hebbel's career is a long battle against all but insuperable obstacles.  Born at Wesselburen in the present province of Schleswig-Holstein on  March 18, 1813, he was the son of a poor stone mason--so poor that, as  Hebbel said, poverty had taken the place of his soul. Though Klaus  Hebbel was a well-meaning man, he was a slave to the inexorable _non  possumus_ of penury. In winter, especially, lack of work made even the  provision of daily bread often difficult and sometimes impossible for  him. But Friedrich Hebbel's childhood, full of hardship as it was, was  not cheerless. The father did what he could; and the mother, at whatever  sacrifice to herself, could nearly always do something for the children.  The greatest hardship was caused by the father's hostility to these  maternal concessions to childish desires; for to him, whose life was  labor, unproductive use of time was a crime. He thought it a matter of  course that his son should become a laboring man like himself, and it is  little less than a miracle that this did not happen. The mother, to be  sure, fostered the boy's more ambitious hopes; the death of the father  in Hebbel's fourteenth year was perhaps a blessing in disguise;  undoubtedly the happiest chance in Hebbel's boyhood, so far as external  events are concerned, was the fact that he won the favor of a real  teacher in his schoolmaster Dethlefsen, who not only gave his education  the proper start, but also recommended him, as his best scholar, to the  local magistrate, J.J. Mohr.    For nearly eight years (1827 to 1835) Hebbel was in Mohr's employ, first  as an errand boy, and ultimately as a clerk, to whom more and more  official business was intrusted. He lived in the household of his  superior, continued in the magistrate's library the assiduous reading  which he had begun with Dethlefsen's books, and acquired, along with the  habits of official accuracy, something of the ways of a higher social  station than that to which he had been born. His contact with the world  of affairs and with litigation also considerably broadened his outlook,  though it was often the seamy side of life that he saw, and his own  early necessities had sharpened his sense of the essential tragedy of  existence. Among the young people of the town Hebbel was as active and  inventive as any; he wrote verses, took part in amateur theatricals, and  was a leader in many undertakings that had not amusement as their sole  object.    From the beginning Hebbel shows extraordinary sensitiveness to esthetic  appeal and a disposition to dreamy imaginativeness. The Bible, the  Protestant hymnal, pre-classical prose and poetry of the eighteenth  century, as well as contemporary romantic fiction, including Jean Paul,  Hoffmann, and Heine, touched his fancy and stirred him to emulation.    [Illustration: FRIEDRICH HEBBEL]    As a boy, he is said to have composed a tragedy _Evolia, the Captain of  Robbers_, which his mother confiscated and burned. His early poems are  echoes of Klopstock, Matthisson, Hoelty, Buerger, and other predecessors;  but especially of Schiller, whose moral seriousness and sonorous  language alike inspired the serious and rhetorically gifted youth. The  influence of Schiller, however, marks no epoch in the poetic development  of Hebbel; it dominates the period of adolescence. The sense of poetry  was aroused in him as a boy, he said, by Paul Gerhardt's hymn \"The woods  are now at rest\" (_Nun ruhen alle Walder_); the discovery of what poetry  is he made in 1830, when he read Uhland's _Minstrel's Curse_ and  perceived that the sole principle of art is not to write, like Schiller,  eloquently about ideas, but \"to make in a particular phenomenon the  universal intuitively perceptible.\"    Having published poems and stories from 1829 on in a local newspaper,  Hebbel, in 1831, seeking a wider audience at the same time that he  longed for a larger sphere of activity, submitted specimens of his work  to Amalie Schoppe in Hamburg, the editress of a fashion paper; and in  this and the following years she printed a considerable number of his  productions. Moreover, she took a genuine personal interest in his  ambitions; and after several plans had proved abortive, she succeeded  in collecting for him a small sum of money and the promise of other  material aid in a plan that should give a firm foundation for the  structure of his hopes: he should come to Hamburg and prepare for the  study of law. Accordingly, on the fourteenth of February, 1835, he left  his modest but secure position in Wesselburen for the alluring great  world where he felt that he belonged, but where he was destined to toil  and to suffer, in a struggle for existence which only a hardy  North-German peasant could have endured.    Hebbel came to Hamburg as a young man of twenty-two, far ahead of his  years in knowledge, judgment, and capacity, but still unacquainted with  rudimentary things belonging to higher education, such as Latin grammar.  He could not find the right tone in dealing with his benefactors, and he  suffered unspeakable humiliation in the conflict of a proud and  independent spirit with the subjection which inconsiderate well-wishers  imposed upon him. He learned more by private reading and by association  with students in a Scientific Society than he learned in school; and to  one woman, Elise"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"EXPEDITIONS    INTO THE INTERIOR OF    EASTERN AUSTRALIA;    WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE RECENTLY EXPLORED REGION OF    AUSTRALIA FELIX,    AND OF THE PRESENT COLONY OF    NEW SOUTH WALES:    BY MAJOR T.L.
