BASKERVILL    PROFESSOR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE IN VANDERBILT  UNIVERSITY NASHVILLE, TENN.    AND    J.W. SEWELL    OF THE FOGG HIGH SCHOOL, NASHVILLE, TENN.      1895          PREFACE.    Of making many English grammars there is no end; nor should there be  till theoretical scholarship and actual practice are more happily  wedded. In this field much valuable work has already been  accomplished; but it has been done largely by workers accustomed to  take the scholar's point of view, and their writings are addressed  rather to trained minds than to immature learners. To find an advanced  grammar unencumbered with hard words, abstruse thoughts, and difficult  principles, is not altogether an easy matter. These things enhance the  difficulty which an ordinary youth experiences in grasping and  assimilating the facts of grammar, and create a distaste for the  study. It is therefore the leading object of this book to be both as  scholarly and as practical as possible. In it there is an attempt to  present grammatical facts as simply, and to lead the student to  assimilate them as thoroughly, as possible, and at the same time to do  away with confusing difficulties as far as may be.    To attain these ends it is necessary to keep ever in the foreground  the _real basis of grammar_; that is, good literature. Abundant  quotations from standard authors have been given to show the student  that he is dealing with the facts of the language, and not with the  theories of grammarians. It is also suggested that in preparing  written exercises the student use English classics instead of \"making  up\" sentences. But it is not intended that the use of literary  masterpieces for grammatical purposes should supplant or even  interfere with their proper use and real value as works of art. It  will, however, doubtless be found helpful to alternate the regular  reading and aesthetic study of literature with a grammatical study, so  that, while the mind is being enriched and the artistic sense  quickened, there may also be the useful acquisition of arousing a keen  observation of all grammatical forms and usages. Now and then it has  been deemed best to omit explanations, and to withhold personal  preferences, in order that the student may, by actual contact with the  sources of grammatical laws, discover for himself the better way in  regarding given data. It is not the grammarian's business to  \"correct:\" it is simply to record and to arrange the usages of  language, and to point the way to the arbiters of usage in all  disputed cases. Free expression within the lines of good usage should  have widest range.    It has been our aim to make a grammar of as wide a scope as is  consistent with the proper definition of the word. Therefore, in  addition to recording and classifying the facts of language, we have  endeavored to attain two other objects,--to cultivate mental skill and  power, and to induce the student to prosecute further studies in this  field. It is not supposable that in so delicate and difficult an  undertaking there should be an entire freedom from errors and  oversights. We shall gratefully accept any assistance in helping to  correct mistakes.    Though endeavoring to get our material as much as possible at first  hand, and to make an independent use of it, we desire to express our  obligation to the following books and articles:--    Meiklejohn's \"English Language,\" Longmans' \"School Grammar,\" West's  \"English Grammar,\" Bain's \"Higher English Grammar\" and \"Composition  Grammar,\" Sweet's \"Primer of Spoken English\" and \"New English  Grammar,\" etc., Hodgson's \"Errors in the Use of English,\" Morris's  \"Elementary Lessons in Historical English Grammar,\" Lounsbury's  \"English Language,\" Champney's \"History of English,\" Emerson's  \"History of the English Language,\" Kellner's \"Historical Outlines of  English Syntax,\" Earle's \"English Prose,\" and Matzner's \"Englische  Grammatik.\" Allen's \"Subjunctive Mood in English,\" Battler's articles  on \"Prepositions\" in the \"Anglia,\" and many other valuable papers,  have also been helpful and suggestive.

Mooney of Wall &  Mooney's Battle-Ground Academy, Franklin, Tenn., for a critical  examination of the first draft of the manuscript, and to Professor  Jno. M. Webb of Webb Bros.

So many slighting remarks have been made of late on the use of  teaching grammar as compared with teaching science, that it is plain  the fact has been lost sight of that grammar is itself a science. The  object we have, or should have, in teaching science, is not to fill a  child's mind with a vast number of facts that may or may not prove  useful to him hereafter, but to draw out and exercise his powers of  observation, and to show him how to make use of what he observes....  And here the teacher of grammar has a great advantage over the teacher  of other sciences, in that the facts he has to call attention to lie  ready at hand for every pupil to observe without the use of apparatus  of any kind while the use of them also lies within the personal  experience of every one.--DR RICHARD MORRIS.    The proper study of a language is an intellectual discipline of the  highest order. If I except discussions on the comparative merits of  Popery and Protestantism, English grammar was the most important  discipline of my boyhood.--JOHN TYNDALL.      INTRODUCTION.      What various opinions writers on English grammar have given in answer  to the question, _What is grammar?_ may be shown by the following--    [Sidenote: _Definitions of grammar._]         English grammar is a description of the usages of the English       language by good speakers and writers of the present       day.--WHITNEY         A description of account of the nature, build, constitution, or       make of a language is called its grammar--MEIKLEJOHN         Grammar teaches the laws of language, and the right method of       using it in speaking and writing.--PATTERSON         Grammar is the science of _letter_; hence the science of using       words correctly.--ABBOTT         The English word _grammar_ relates only to the laws which govern       the significant forms of words, and the construction of the       sentence.--RICHARD GRANT WHITE    These are sufficient to suggest several distinct notions about English  grammar--    [Sidenote: _Synopsis of the above._]    (1) It makes rules to tell us how to use words.    (2) It is a record of usage which we ought to follow.    (3) It is concerned with the _forms_ of the language.    (4) English _has_ no grammar in the sense of forms, or inflections,  but takes account merely of the nature and the uses of words in  sentences.    [Sidenote: _The older idea and its origin._]    Fierce discussions have raged over these opinions, and numerous works  have been written to uphold the theories. The first of them remained  popular for a very long time. It originated from the etymology of the  word _grammar_ (Greek _gramma_, writing, a letter), and from an effort  to build up a treatise on English grammar by using classical grammar  as a model.    Perhaps a combination of (1) and (3) has been still more popular,  though there has been vastly more classification than there are forms.    [Sidenote: _The opposite view_.]    During recent years, (2) and (4) have been gaining ground, but they  have had hard work to displace the older and more popular theories. It  is insisted by many that the student's time should be used in studying  general literature, and thus learning the fluent and correct use of  his mother tongue. It is also insisted that the study and discussion  of forms and inflections is an inexcusable imitation of classical  treatises.    [Sidenote: _The difficulty_.]    Which view shall the student of English accept? Before this is  answered, we should decide whether some one of the above theories must  be taken as the right one, and the rest disregarded.    The real reason for the diversity of views is a confusion of two  distinct things,--what the _definition_ of grammar should be, and what  the _purpose_ of grammar should be.    [Sidenote: _The material of grammar_.]    The province of English grammar is, rightly considered, wider than is  indicated by any one of the above definitions; and the student ought  to have a clear idea of the ground to be covered.    [Sidenote: _Few inflections_.]    It must be admitted that the language has very few inflections at  present, as compared with Latin or Greek; so that a small grammar will  hold them all.    [Sidenote: _Making rules is risky_.]    It is also evident, to those who have studied the language  historically, that it is very hazardous to make rules in grammar: what  is at present regarded as correct may not be so twenty years from now,  even if our rules are founded on the keenest scrutiny of the  \"standard\" writers of our time.

Sweat rolled down his bullet head and stood  upon his heavy jowls and bull neck. His lieutenant marched beside  him while Underlieutenant von Goss brought up the rear, following  with a handful of askaris the tired and all but exhausted porters  whom the black soldiers, following the example of their white officer,  encouraged with the sharp points of bayonets and the metal-shod  butts of rifles.    There were no porters within reach of Hauptmann Schneider so he  vented his Prussian spleen upon the askaris nearest at hand, yet  with greater circumspection since these men bore loaded rifles--and  the three white men were alone with them in the heart of Africa.    Ahead of the hauptmann marched half his company, behind him the  other half--thus were the dangers of the savage jungle minimized  for the German captain. At the forefront of the column staggered  two naked savages fastened to each other by a neck chain. These  were the native guides impressed into the service of Kultur and upon  their poor, bruised bodies Kultur's brand was revealed in divers  cruel wounds and bruises.    Thus even in darkest Africa was the light of German civilization  commencing to reflect itself upon the undeserving natives just as  at the same period, the fall of 1914, it was shedding its glorious  effulgence upon benighted Belgium.    It is true that the guides had led the party astray; but this is  the way of most African guides. Nor did it matter that ignorance  rather than evil intent had been the cause of their failure. It  was enough for Hauptmann Fritz Schneider to know that he was lost  in the African wilderness and that he had at hand human beings less  powerful than he who could be made to suffer by torture. That he  did not kill them outright was partially due to a faint hope that  they might eventually prove the means of extricating him from his  difficulties and partially that so long as they lived they might  still be made to suffer.    The poor creatures, hoping that chance might lead them at last  upon the right trail, insisted that they knew the way and so led  on through a dismal forest along a winding game trail trodden deep  by the feet of countless generations of the savage denizens of the  jungle.    Here Tantor, the elephant, took his long way from dust wallow to  water. Here Buto, the rhinoceros, blundered blindly in his solitary  majesty, while by night the great cats paced silently upon their  padded feet beneath the dense canopy of overreaching trees toward  the broad plain beyond, where they found their best hunting.    It was at the edge of this plain which came suddenly and  unexpectedly  before the eyes of the guides that their sad hearts beat with  renewed hope. Here the hauptmann drew a deep sigh of relief, for  after days of hopeless wandering through almost impenetrable jungle  the broad vista of waving grasses dotted here and there with open  park like woods and in the far distance the winding line of green  shrubbery that denoted a river appeared to the European a veritable  heaven.    The Hun smiled in his relief, passed a cheery word with his  lieutenant,  and then scanned the broad plain with his field glasses. Back and  forth they swept across the rolling land until at last they came  to rest upon a point near the center of the landscape and close to  the green-fringed contours of the river.    \"We are in luck,\" said Schneider to his companions. \"Do you see  it?\"    The lieutenant, who was also gazing through his own glasses,  finally brought them to rest upon the same spot that had held the  attention of his superior.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"an English farm. It must be Greystoke's, for there  is none other in this part of British East Africa. God is with us,  Herr Captain.\"    \"We have come upon the English schweinhund long before he can have  learned that his country is at war with ours,\" replied Schneider.  \"Let him be the first to feel the iron hand of Germany.\"    \"Let us hope that he is at home,\" said the lieutenant, \"that we  may take him with us when we report to Kraut at Nairobi.  It will  go well indeed with Herr Hauptmann Fritz Schneider if he brings in  the famous Tarzan of the Apes as a prisoner of war.\"    Schneider smiled and puffed out his chest. \"You are right, my  friend,\" he said, \"it will go well with both of us; but I shall  have to travel far to catch General Kraut before he reaches Mombasa.  These English pigs with their contemptible army will make good time  to the Indian Ocean.\"    It was in a better frame of mind that the small force set out across  the open country toward the trim and well-kept farm buildings of  John Clayton, Lord Greystoke; but disappointment was to be their  lot since neither Tarzan of the Apes nor his son was at home.    Lady Jane, ignorant of the fact that a state of war existed between  Great Britain and Germany, welcomed the officers most hospitably  and gave orders through her trusted Waziri to prepare a feast for  the black soldiers of the enemy.    Far to the east, Tarzan of the Apes was traveling rapidly from  Nairobi toward the farm. At Nairobi he had received news of the  World War that had already started, and, anticipating an immediate  invasion of British East Africa by the Germans, was hurrying homeward  to fetch his wife to a place of greater security. With him were a  score of his ebon warriors, but far too slow for the ape-man was  the progress of these trained and hardened woodsmen.    When necessity demanded, Tarzan of the Apes sloughed the thin  veneer of his civilization and with it the hampering apparel that  was its badge. In a moment the polished English gentleman reverted  to the naked ape man.    His mate was in danger. For the time, that single thought  dominated.  He did not think of her as Lady Jane Greystoke, but rather as the  she he had won by the might of his steel thews, and that he must  hold and protect by virtue of the same offensive armament.    It was no member of the House of Lords who swung swiftly and grimly  through the tangled forest or trod with untiring muscles the wide  stretches of open plain--it was a great he ape filled with a single  purpose that excluded all thoughts of fatigue or danger.    Little Manu, the monkey, scolding and chattering in the upper  terraces of the forest, saw him pass. Long had it been since he had  thus beheld the great Tarmangani naked and alone hurtling through  the jungle. Bearded and gray was Manu, the monkey, and to his dim  old eyes came the fire of recollection of those days when Tarzan  of the Apes had ruled supreme, Lord of the Jungle, over all the  myriad life that trod the matted vegetation between the boles of  the great trees, or flew or swung or climbed in the leafy fastness  upward to the very apex of the loftiest terraces.    And Numa, the lion, lying up for the day close beside last night's  successful kill, blinked his yellow-green eyes and twitched his  tawny tail as he caught the scent spoor of his ancient enemy.    Nor was Tarzan senseless to the presence of Numa or Manu or any of  the many jungle beasts he passed in his rapid flight towards the  west. No particle had his shallow probing of English society dulled  his marvelous sense faculties. His nose had picked out the presence  of Numa, the lion, even before the majestic king of beasts was  aware of his passing.    He had heard noisy little Manu, and even the soft rustling of the  parting shrubbery where Sheeta passed before either of these alert  animals sensed his presence.    But however keen the senses of the ape-man, however swift his  progress through the wild country of his adoption, however mighty  the muscles that bore him, he was still mortal.  Time and space  placed their inexorable limits upon him; nor was there another who  realized this truth more keenly than Tarzan. He chafed and fretted  that he could not travel with the swiftness of thought and that the  long tedious miles stretching far ahead of him must require hours  and hours of tireless effort upon his part before he would swing  at last from the final bough of the fringing forest into the open  plain and in sight of his goal.    Days it took, even though he lay up at night for but a few hours  and left to chance the finding of meat directly on his trail. If  Wappi, the antelope, or Horta, the boar, chanced in his way when  he was hungry, he ate, pausing but long enough to make the kill  and cut himself a steak.    Then at last the long journey drew to its close and he was passing  through the last stretch of heavy forest that bounded his estate  upon the east, and then this was traversed and he stood upon the  plain's edge looking out across his broad lands towards his home.    At the first glance his eyes narrowed and his muscles tensed.  Even  at that distance he could see that something was amiss.  A thin  spiral of smoke arose at the right of the bungalow where the barns  had stood, but there were no barns there now, and from the bungalow  chimney from which smoke should have arisen, there arose nothing.
