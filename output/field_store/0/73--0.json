And glad they were when they came to the water-hole, where only one  white man had gone before, which the natives know as the camp of Bwona  Khubla, and found the water there.    It lies three days from the nearest other water, and when Bwona Khubla  had gone there three years ago, what with malaria with which he was  shaking all over, and what with disgust at finding the water-hole dry,  he had decided to die there, and in that part of the world such  decisions are always fatal.  In any case he was overdue to die, but  hitherto his amazing resolution, and that terrible strength of  character that so astounded his porters, had kept him alive and moved  his safari on.    He had had a name no doubt, some common name such as hangs as likely  as not over scores of shops in London; but that had gone long ago, and  nothing identified his memory now to distinguish it from the memories  of all the other dead but \"Bwona Khubla,\" the name the Kikuyus gave  him.    There is not doubt that he was a fearful man, a man that was dreaded  still for his personal force when his arm was no longer able to lift  the kiboko, when all his men knew he was dying, and to this day though  he is dead.    Though his temper was embittered by malaria and the equatorial sun,  nothing impaired his will, which remained a compulsive force to the  very last, impressing itself upon all, and after the last, from what  the Kikuyus say.  The country must have had powerful laws that drove  Bwona Khubla out, whatever country it was.    On the morning of the day that they were to come to the camp of Bwona  Khubla all the porters came to the travelers' tents asking for dow.  Dow is the white man's medicine, that cures all evils; the nastier it  tastes, the better it is.  They wanted down this morning to keep away  devils, for they were near the place where Bwona Khubla died.    The travelers gave them quinine.    By sunset the came to Campini Bwona Khubla and found water there. Had  they not found water many of them must have died, yet none felt any  gratitude to the place, it seemed too ominous, too full of doom, too  much harassed almost by unseen, irresistible things.    And all the natives came again for dow as soon as the tents were  pitched, to protect them from the last dreams of Bwona Khubla, which  they say had stayed behind when the last safari left taking Bwona  Khubla's body back to the edge of civilization to show to the white  men there that they had not killed him, for the white men might not  know that they durst not kill Bwona Khubla.    And the travelers gave them more quinine, so much being bad for the  nerves, and that night by the camp-fires there was no pleasant talk;  all talking at once of meat they had eaten and cattle that each one  owned, but a gloomy silence hung by every fire and the little canvas  shelters.  They told the white men that Bwona Khubla's city, of which  he had thought at the last (and where the natives believed he was once  a king), of which he had raved till the loneliness rang with his  raving, had settled down all about them; and they were afraid, for it  was so strange a city, and wanted more dow.  And the two travelers  gave them more quinine, for they saw real fear in their faces, and  knew they might run away and leave them alone in that place, that  they, too, had come to fear with an almost equal dread, though they  knew not why.  And as the night wore on their feeling of boding  deepened, although they had shared three bottles or so of champagne  that they meant to keep for days when they killed a lion.    This is the story that each of those two men tell, and which their  porters corroborate, but then a Kikuyu will always say whatever he  thinks is expected of him.    The travelers were both in bed and trying to sleep but not able to do  so because of an ominous feeling.  That mournfullest of all the cries  of the wild, the hyaena like a damned soul lamenting, strangely enough  had ceased.  The night wore on to the hour when Bwona Khubla had died  three or four years ago, dreaming and raving of \"his city\"; and in the  hush a sound softly arose, like a wind at first, then like the roar of  beasts, then unmistakably the sound of motors--motors and motor  busses.    And then they saw, clearly and unmistakably they say, in that lonely  desolation where the equator comes up out of the forest and climbs  over jagged hills,--they say they saw London.    There could have been no moon that night, but they say there was a  multitude of stars.  Mists had come rolling up at evening about the  pinnacles of unexplored red peaks that clustered round the camp.  But  they say the mist must have cleared later on; at any rate they swear  they could see London, see it and hear the roar of it.  Both say they  saw it not as they knew it at all, not debased by hundreds of  thousands of lying advertisements, but transfigured, all its houses  magnificent, its chimneys rising grandly into pinnacles, its vast  squares full of the most gorgeous trees, transfigured and yet London.    Its windows were warm and happy, shining at night, the lamps in their  long rows welcomed you, the public-houses were gracious jovial places;  yet it was London.    They could smell the smells of London, hear London songs, and yet it  was never the London that they knew; it was as though they had looked  on some strange woman's face with the eyes of her lover.  For of all  the towns of the earth or cities of song; of all the spots there be,  unhallowed or hallowed, it seemed to those two men then that the city  they saw was of all places the most to be desired by far.  They say a  barrel organ played quite near them, they say a coster was singing,  they admit that he was singing out of tune, they admit a cockney  accent, and yet they say that that song had in it something that no  earthly song had ever had before, and both men say that they would  have wept but that there was a feeling about their heartstrings that  was far too deep for tears.  They believe that the longing of this  masterful man, that was able to rule a safari by raising a hand, had  been so strong at the last that it had impressed itself deeply upon  nature and had caused a mirage that may not fade wholly away, perhaps  for several years.    I tried to establish by questions the truth or reverse of this story,  but the two men's tempers had been so spoiled by Africa that they were  not up to cross-examination.  They would not even say if their  camp-fires were still burning.  They say that they saw the London  lights all round them from eleven o'clock till midnight, they could  hear London voices and the sound of the traffic clearly, and over  all, a little misty perhaps, but unmistakably London, arose the great  metropolis.    After midnight London quivered a little and grew more indistinct, the  sound of the traffic began to dwindle away, voices seemed farther off,  ceased altogether, and all was quiet once more where the mirage  shimmered and faded, and a bull rhinoceros coming down through the  stillness snorted, and watered at the Carlton Club.          HOW THE OFFICE OF POSTMAN FELL VACANT IN OTFORD-UNDER-THE-WOLD    The duties of postman at Otford-under-the-Wold carried Amuel Sleggins  farther afield than the village, farther afield than the last house in  the lane, right up to the big bare wold and the house where no one  went, no one that is but the three grim men that dwelt there and the  secretive wife of one, and, once a year when the queer green letter  came, Amuel Sleggins the postman.    The green letter always came just as the leaves were turning,  addressed to the eldest of the three grim men, with a wonderful  Chinese stamp and the Otford post-mark, and Amuel Sleggins carried it  up to the house.    He was not afraid to go, for he always took the letter, had done so  for seven years, yet whenever summer began to draw to a close, Amuel  Sleggins was ill at ease, and if there was a touch of autumn about  shivered unduly so that all folk wondered.    And then one day a wind would blow from the East, and the wild geese  would appear, having left the sea, flying high and crying strangely,  and pass till they were no more than a thin black line in the sky like  a magical stick flung up by a doer of magic, twisting and twirling  away; and the leaves would turn on the trees and the mists be white on  the marshes and the sun set large and red and autumn would step down  quietly that night from the wold; and the next day the strange green  letter would come from China.    His fear of the three grim men and that secretive woman and their  lonely, secluded house, or else the cadaverous cold of the dying  season, rather braced Amuel when the time was come and he would step  out bolder upon the day that he feared than he had perhaps for weeks.  He longed on that day for a letter for the last house in the lane,  there he would dally and talk awhile and look on church-going faces  before his last tramp over the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11462"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

POPE'S TEMPLE, AT HAGLEY      [Illustration: Pope's Temple, at Hagley]    Reader! are you going out of town \"_in search of the picturesque_\"--if  so, bend your course to the classic, the consecrated ground of HAGLEY!  think of LYTTLETON, POPE, SHENSTONE, and THOMSON, or refresh your memory  from the \"_Spring_\" of the latter, as--      Courting the muse, thro' _Hagley_ Park thou strayst.    Thy _British Tempe_! There along the dale,    With woods o'erhung, and shagg'd with mossy rocks,    Whence on each hand the gushing waters play,    And down the rough cascade white dashing fall,    Or gleam in lengthen'd vista through the trees,    You silent steal; or sit beneath the shade    Of solemn oaks, that tuft the swelling mounts    Thrown graceful round by Nature's careless hand,    And pensive listen to the various voice    Of rural peace; the herds, the flocks, the birds,    The hollow-whispering breeze, the 'plaint of rills,    That, purling down amid the twisted roots    Which creep around their dewy murmurs shake    On the sooth'd ear.    Such is the fervid language in which the Poet of the year invoked      \"LYTTLETON, the friend!\"    Yet these lines will kindle the delight and reverence of every lover of  Nature, in common with the effect of the _Seasons_ on the reader, who  \"wonders that he never saw before what Thomson shows him, and that he  never yet has felt what Thomson impresses.\"[1]        [1] Johnson's Life of Thomson.    But we quit these nether flights of song to describe the locality of  Hagley Park, of whose beauties our Engraving is but a mere vignette, and  in comparison like holding a candle to the sun. The village of Hagley is  a short distance from Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, whence the  pleasantest route to the park is to turn to the right on the Birmingham  road, which cuts the grounds into two unequal parts. The house is a  plain and even simple, yet classical edifice. Whately, in his work on  Gardening, describes it as surrounded by a lawn, of fine uneven ground,  and diversified with large clumps, little groups, and single trees; it  is open in front, but covered on one side by the Witchbury hills; on the  other side, and behind by the eminences in the park, which are high and  steep, and all overspread with a lofty hanging wood. The lawn pressing  to the front, or creeping up the slopes of three hills, and sometimes  winding along glades into the depth of the wood, traces a beautiful  outline to a sylvan scene, already rich to luxuriance in massive  foliage, and stately growth. The present house was built by the first  Lord Lyttleton, not on, but near to, the site of the ancient family  mansion, a structure of the sixteenth century. Admission may be obtained  on application to the housekeeper; and for paintings, carving, and  gilding, Hagley is one of the richest show-houses in the kingdom.[2]        [2] _Show-houses_ is a very appropriate term for such of the      mansions of our nobility and gentry as are open to public      inspection. Hagley is extremely rich in treasures of art. A mere      catalogue of them would occupy the whole of our sheet; but we      must notice two curiously carved mahogany tables, which cost      L200.; four exquisitely carved busts of Shakspeare, Milton,      Spenser, and Dryden, by Scheimaker, and bequeathed to George,      Lord Lyttleton, by Pope; the portrait of Pope and his dog,      Bounce; a fine Madonna, by Rubens; several pictures by Vandyke,      Sir Peter Lely, Le Brun, &c. &c. the Gobelin tapestry of the      drawing room; the ceiling painted by Cipriani; and the family      pictures, among which is Judge Lyttleton, copied from the      painted glass in the Middle Temple Hall.    Much as the visiter will admire the refined taste displayed within the  mansion, his admiration will be heightened by the classic taste in which  the grounds are disposed. A short distance from the house, embosomed in  trees, stands the church, built in the time of Henry III.; with a  sublime Gothic arch, richly painted windows, and a ceiling fretted with  the heraldic fires of the Lyttleton family, whose tombs are placed on  all sides; among them, the resting-place of the gay poet is  distinguished by the following plain inscription:--      This unadorned stone was placed here    By the particular desire and express    Directions of the Right Honourable       GEORGE, LORD LYTTLETON,    Who died August 22, 1773, aged 64.    Leaving the church we ascend to the crest of a hill, on which stands the  Prince of Wales's Pillar. From this point, the view is inexpressibly  beautiful, in which may be seen an octagon seat sacred to the memory of  Thomson, and erected on the brow of a verdant steep, his favourite spot.  In the foreground is a gently winding valley; on the rising hill beyond  is a noble wood, whilst to the right the open country fades in the  distance; on the left the Clent hills appear, and a dusky antique tower  stands just below them at the extremity of the wood; whilst in the midst  of it, we can discern the _Doric temple sacred to Pope_. This exquisite  gem of the picturesque is represented in our Engraving.    In the adjoining grove of oaks is the antique tower; in a beautiful  amphitheatre of wood, an Ionic rotunda; and in an embowering grove a  Palladian bridge, with a light airy portico. Here on a fine lawn is the  urn inscribed to Pope, mentioned by Shenstone:      Here Pope! ah, never must that towering mind    To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;    What art, what friendship! oh! what fame resign'd;    In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.    At the end of the valley, in an obscure corner is a hermitage, composed  of roots and moss, whence we look down on a piece of water in the  hollow, thickly shaded with tall trees, (_see the engraving_,) over  which is a fine view of distant landscape. This spot is the extremity of  the park, and the Clent hills rise in all their wild irregularity,  immediately behind it.    We have not space to describe, or rather to abridge from Whately's  beautiful description, a tithe of the classic embellishments of Hagley.  Shenstone as well as Pope has here his votive urn. Ivied ruin, temple,  grotto, statue, fountain, and bridge; the proud portico and the humble  rustic seat, alternate amidst these ornamental charms, and never were  Nature and art more delightfully blended than in the beauties of Hagley.  Here Pope, Shenstone, and Thomson[3] passed many hours of calm  contemplation and poetic ease, amidst the hospitalities of the noble  owner of Hagley. To think of their kindred spirits haunting its groves,  and their imaginative contrivances of votive temples, urns, and tablets,  and to combine them with these enchanting scenes of Nature, is to  realize all that Poets have sung of Arcadia of old. Happy! happy life  for the man of letters; what a retreat must your bowers have afforded  from the common-place perplexities of every-day life: Alas! the picture  is almost too sunny for sober contemplation.        [3] Thomson's affectionate letter to his sister, (quoted by      Johnson, who received it from Boswell,) is dated \"Hagley, in      Worcestershire, October the 4th, 1747.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _In part of the impression of our last Number, we stated the architect  of the front of_ Apsley House, _to be Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, instead of  Mr. Benjamin Wyatt, by whom the design was furnished, and under whose  superintendence this splendid improvement has been executed.

Yet from the store    Of your abundance, you refuse to grant    The veriest trifle. May the bounty    Of that great God who gave you what you have    Ne'er from you flow. You have forgot me, sir,    But I remember ere I left this land,    By way of traffic for the western world,    I had a favourite, faithful dog,    Who for the kindnesses I pour'd upon him    Would fawn upon me: not in flattery,    But in a sort that spoke his generous nature.    Lasting as memory,    Faster than friendship--deeper than the wave    Is the affection of a mindless brute.
