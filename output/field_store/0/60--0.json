[Illustration: THE TEMPLE CHURCH.]      The Temple Church,[1] London, was erected in the twelfth century; but  among antiquarians considerable difference of opinion at various times  prevailed as to who were the original builders of these round churches,  which form the most striking and beautiful specimens of the architectural  skill of our Anglo-Norman ancestors. In England there are four examples of  round churches, almost in perfect preservation, namely, the church of St.  Mary, Temple; St. Sepulchre, Northampton; St. Mary, Cambridge; and that of  Little Maplestead, Essex. It was long thought that they were of Jewish  origin; but through the ingenious and learned essays of Mr. Essex and of  Mr. Britton, this erroneous notion has been entirely removed. Mr. Essex, in  his Essay, observes, in support of his opinion, that \"their Temple at  Jerusalem was not of a circular form, neither was the Tabernacle of Moses;  nor do we find the modern Jews affect that figure in building their  synagogues. It has, however, been generally supposed that the round church  at Cambridge, that at Northampton, and some others, were built for  synagogues by the Jews while they were permitted to dwell in those places.  But as no probable reason can be assigned for this supposition, and I think  it is very certain that the Jews who were settled in Cambridge had their  synagogue, and probably dwelled together in a part of the town now called  the Jewry, so we may reasonably conclude the round churches we find in  other parts of this kingdom were not built by the Jews for synagogues,  whatever the places may be called in which they stand.\"--It has been  generally allowed by these and other writers on archaeology, that the  primitive church of this form was that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem,  and that the Temple Church at London was built by the Knights' Templars,  whose occupation was the protection of Christian pilgrims against the  Saracens. It has been further urged by a correspondent (Charles Clarke,  Esq. F.S.A.) in the first volume of Britton's \"Architectural Antiquities,\"  that two of the before-mentioned round churches, namely, Northampton and  Cambridge, were in fact built by \"affluent crusaders, in imitation of that  of the Holy Sepulchre;\" and in support of his opinion he cites several  historical notices.        [1] The circular part.    The late perfect restoration of the Temple Church ought to be proudly  recorded in our architectural annals. The excellence of the workmanship,  and the native purity of the detail, evince not only scientific skill, but  also a laudable motive of preserving this antique specimen of pure  Anglo-Norman architecture from the ravages of time. Let the architect's  attention be directed to the western doorway, and also to the interior of  the church; and here, in good preservation, he will see excellent specimens  of their mode of ornamenting the moldings by the cable, the lozenge, the  cheveron, the nail-head, the billet, &c. &c., ornaments peculiar to the  _round style_. The circular-headed windows, with their slender columns,  also show, that in the restoration the style has not been tampered with;  but substantial authorities have been quoted to perfect this praiseworthy  attempt of the architect. That part of the church which has been added at a  later date than the circular part, and for the convenience of divine  worship, is lighted by the beautiful proportioned triple lancet-shaped  windows, so justly admired. A writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for May,  1827, after making some judicious remarks, seems to think the crosses on  the ends of the building, \"as not in character with the building.\" Now as  to architectural propriety in the decorations of a Christian church, no  ornament could be better devised; and if we proceed to the antiquity of  such ornament, I would observe, that the adoption would be equally correct,  that being the insignia of the banner under which the Knights' Templars  originally fought.    C. DAVY.           *       *       *       *       *      BRIDGET TROT AND TIMOTHY GREEN.    (_For the Mirror_.)        \"'Tis a common tale,      An ordinary sorrow of man's life;      A tale of silent sufferings, hardly clothed      In bodily form.\"    WORDSWORTH.        Miss Bridget _Trot_, a \"_wo_\"-man was,      Of excellent repute,    Who _kept a stand_ in Leadenhall,      And there disposed of fruit.      And though in features rather _dark_,      No _fairer_ could be found;    For what she sold, like _ringing_ gold,      When _peeled_, was always _sound_!      She had moreover notions _high_,      And thought herself above    The very _low_-ly common way      Of _falling_ into love.      And therefore when to her his _suit_      A _Snip_ did often press    With vows of love, she _cut_ him _short_      At _length_, without _re-dress_.      Yet nothing odd was there in this      One case, it must be said;    For who that wish'd a _perfect_ man      Could with a _ninth part_ wed?      Not she for one, whatever he      Might do to make him _smart_,    And howsoe'er her saying \"Nay\"      Might add it to his heart.      'Tis very strange, (yet so it is,)      That vows should go for naught.    But she who _strove_ to 'scape love's _toils_      Quite unawares was caught!      For though so _hard_ to Snip _at first_,      _At last_ it chanced that she    A sort of soft emotion felt      Towards one Timothy,      A butcher--_Green_ by name, but _red_      In face, as was his cap,    And though he seldom tasted _wine_,      A _port_-ly sort of chap.      This man one day in passing by,      In taste for what she'd got,    Saw Biddy's stall--and 'twas her _fate_      To sell to him a _lot!_      She thought his manners very sweet,      He gave so fond a gaze;    (But dashing _blades_ of such like trades      Have ever _killing_ ways!)      And whilst he paid the _coppers_ down,      He had the _brass_ to say    Her _fruit_ was sweet, but sweeter still      The _apple_ of her eye.      Besides all this, he looked so neat      Whilst shouldering his tray;    So what with _steel, et cetera,_      Her heart was _stole_ away!      Lo! _shortly after_ both agreed,      They fixed the wedding day,    But _long before_ that day arriv'd      He took to stop away!      From that same time her peace of mind      And comfort were at _steak_--    She did so _lean_ to Mr. Green,      Her heart was like to break!      At last she went one morn to see      What he could be about,    And hoped, alone, to find him _in_,      But he had just popt _out_.      She ax'd, \"Is Mr. Green at home?\"      Of one who, with a laugh,    Replied, \"He's not! but if you please      I'll fetch _his better half_.\"      \"His what?\" scarce _uttered_ Bridget out,      With _utter_most dismay;    And _there_ she stopt, she could no more,      And nearly swoon'd _away!_      But when at length she was herself,      And saw her faithless clown.    She straightway went to blow him _up_,      But got a good set _down_!      \"Oh, cold and faithless Tim,\" quoth she,      \"You vowed you couldn't _smother_    Your _burning_ love for me, but now      You're married to another!\"      \"Is this the way you treat me, sir?      Too _cheaply_ was I bought!    I loved you _dearly_, but it seems      That that _all went for naught_.\"      She sighed, and gave one parting look,      Then tore herself away    From her false swain and Mrs. Green,      For ever and a day!      And _very_ soon got _very_ ill,      And _very_ quick did die,    And _very_ truly _veri_fied      Her love for Timothy!

In the steeple of Glasgow is a great bell, which is twelve feet one inch in  circumference, and has a grave and deep tone. In 1789, it was accidentally  cracked by some persons who got admission to the steeple. It was,  therefore, sent to London, and cast anew. On the outside of it is the  following inscription:--        In the year of grace      1594,      Marcus Knox,      a merchant of Glasgow,      zealous for the interests of the reformed religion,      caused me to be fabricated in Holland      for the use of his fellow citizens in Glasgow,      and placed me with solemnity      in the tower of their cathedral.      My function      was to announce, by the impress on my bosom,      (Me audito venias doctrinam sanctam ut discas;[2])      and      I was taught to proclaim the hours of unheeded time.      195 years had I sounded these awful warnings,      when I was broken      by the hands of inconsiderate and      unskilful men.      In the year 1790,      I was cast into the furnace,      refounded at London,      and returned to my sacred vocation.      Reader,      thou also shall know a resurrection,      may it be to eternal life.    MALVINA.

GUY'S CLIFF.        \"A home of pleasure, a place meet for the Muses.\"--LELAND.      Warwick--what olden glories and tales of other times are associated with  this county. How many of its sites are connected with high-minded men and  great and glorious actions. To the antiquary, the poet, and the  philosopher, every foot is hallowed ground; and even the cold calculations  of the commercial speculator treat with regard a county whose manufactures  add to the stock of national wealth and importance. How many stories of  love, war, and chivalry are told of its halls, castles, and monasteries,  their lords and ladies and maidens of high birth. Kenilworth and  STRATFORD--Leicester, SHAKSPEARE and Warwick--like long trails of light,  all flit before us in this retrospective dream of the days of \"merry  England.\"    Guy's Cliff is situated about one mile and a half north-east of Warwick.  Here the river Avon winds through fertile meadows; and on its western bank,  a combination of rock and wood, singularly picturesque, invited at an early  period the reveries of superstitious seclusion and poetical fancy. It is  supposed that here was an oratory, and a cell for the hermit, in Saxon  times; and it is certain that a hermit dwelt in this lovely recess in the  reigns of Edward III. and Henry IV. This is the spot to which the renowned  _Guy_, Earl of Warwick, is said to have retired after his duel with the  Danish Colbrond;[1] and here his neglected countess, the fair Felicia, is  reported to have interred his remains. It appears that Henry V. visited  Guy's Cliff, and was so charmed with its natural beauties, and, probably,  so much interested by the wild legend connected with the place, that he  determined to found a chantry for two priests here. But war and an early  death prevented the performance of this, among many other pious and  benevolent intentions ascribed to the heroic Henry. Such a chantry was,  however, founded in the first year of Henry VI. by Richard Beauchamp, Earl  of Warwick; but the chapel and some contiguous buildings were not completed  till after the earl's decease. In this delightful retreat lived John Rous,  the antiquary, as a chantry priest.        [1] See MIRROR, vol xiii. p. 114.    About the middle of the eighteenth century, this estate passed to a private  gentleman, who built a handsome mansion here. But the chief attractions  are the natural beauties of the grounds--as the rock, on which the house  and chapel are built. Here is shown a cave, devoutly believed by  neighbouring peasants to be that which Guy \"hewed with his own hands,\" and  in which he lived        Like a Palmer poore.    The chapel founded by Richard Beauchamp was a plain, substantial edifice.  The founder caused to be carved from the solid rock on which this chapel  abuts, a rude statue of the famous Earl Guy, about eight feet in height. It  would appear, from a print in Dugdale's Warwickshire, that this figure was  well preserved in the seventeenth century.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT CROSSES IN ENGLAND.    (_For the Mirror._)            \"She doth stray about    By holy _crosses_, where she kneels and prays    For happy wedlock hours.\"      SHAKSPEARE.      In former times, an idea of peculiar sanctity was annexed to crosses. They  not only marked civil and ecclesiastical limits, but probably served for  stations, when the bounds were visited in processions. It was a common  practice for mendicants to place themselves near some of these crosses, and  ask alms; whence the ancient proverb, \"He begs like a cripple at a cross.\"  Cornwall abounds with stone crosses. In churchyards, by the side of roads,  and on the open downs, they remain solitary and neglected. In almost every  town that had an abbey, or any other religious foundation, there was one of  these structures. The monks frequently harangued the populace from these  crosses. Many of them still remain, exhibiting beautiful specimens of  architecture and sculpture. The most memorable and interesting objects of  this kind were those which King Edward I. erected at the different stages  where the corpse of Queen Eleanor rested, in its progress from  Nottinghamshire to London. Mr. Gough tells us, that there were originally  fifteen of these elegant structures; but only three are now remaining,  which, by their peculiar beauty, as specimens of architecture and  productions of art, serve to excite regret at the destruction of the  others. The first of the three above-mentioned, is the cross at Geddington,  about three miles from Kettering, in Northamptonshire. The second is the  Queen's Cross, near Northampton. The third is the cross at Waltham, in  Hertfordshire. For a further account of these crosses, see Mr. Britton's  \"Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      TO R.H., ON HER DEPARTURE FOR LONDON.

The tale which to _thee_ I've confest      Another ne'er shall hear again;    Nor love, that link'd me with the blest,      Be darken'd with an earthly chain.    No, as the scroll above the dead,      The dreams of parted joys will last;    There is a bliss now love has fled,      To trace this record of the past.    Then, oh! mid all remember me--    My latest thought will be for thee.      Life hath been as a cloudy day,      Yet still it hath not _all_ been gloom,    For many a wild and broken ray      Hath cheer'd awhile my spirit's doom;    As flow'rets on a river's rim,      Whose shadows deck each passing wave,    Thought lingers on, perturb'd and dim,      Or sunbeam resting on a grave.    Remember me--remember me--    My latest thought will be for thee.      Where'er my feet may wander now,      No more awakes the slightest care;    It matters not--for still wilt thou      Be present 'mid my heart's despair.    So springs and blooms, in lonely state,      Some flow'ret on a roofless cot,    And decks with smiles, though desolate,      The gloomy stillness of the spot.    Remember me--remember me--    My latest thought will be for thee.      Though calm the eye, and still the tongue,      It needs not that the cheek be pale    To prove the heart by feelings wrung,      And brooding o'er a hopeless tale;    For calm is oft the ocean's breast,      Though 'neath its deep blue waters lie    A thousand wrecks--so sorrows rest      In still and silent misery.    Remember me--remember me--    My latest thought will be for thee.    H.P.           *       *       *       *       *      THE COURSE OF LOVE.

Tell whence the magnet's force,      The central motive scan,    Lay bare Nile's hidden source,      Earth's vast circumference span.      Results from such detail      Skill superhuman prove:    Yet powers like these would fail      To tell the course of love.      Direct the impulse fierce      Of ocean's watery sway;    When wint'ry tempests pierce,      Bind Boreas to obey.      Go, mould the fleeting cloud,      The lucid dew-drop mix,    The solar radiance shroud,      The trembling moonbeam fix.      Then bid the wand'ring star      Within the zodiac move;    'Twere task more hard by far      To guide the course of love.
