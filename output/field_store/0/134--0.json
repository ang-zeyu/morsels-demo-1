THE SIGN OF THE SUNSET    \"BUT the man's almost dead.\"    The words stung John Hare's fainting spirit into life. He opened his  eyes. The desert still stretched before him, the appalling thing that  had overpowered him with its deceiving purple distance. Near by stood a  sombre group of men.    \"Leave him here,\" said one, addressing a gray-bearded giant. \"He's the  fellow sent into southern Utah to spy out the cattle thieves. He's all  but dead. Dene's outlaws are after him. Don't cross Dene.\"    The stately answer might have come from a Scottish Covenanter or a  follower of Cromwell.    \"Martin Cole, I will not go a hair's-breadth out of my way for Dene or  any other man. You forget your religion. I see my duty to God.\"    \"Yes, August Naab, I know,\" replied the little man, bitterly. \"You would  cast the Scriptures in my teeth, and liken this man to one who went down  from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. But I've suffered  enough at the hands of Dene.\"    The formal speech, the Biblical references, recalled to the reviving  Hare that he was still in the land of the Mormons. As he lay there the  strange words of the Mormons linked the hard experience of the last few  days with the stern reality of the present.    \"Martin Cole, I hold to the spirit of our fathers,\" replied Naab, like  one reading from the Old Testament. \"They came into this desert land to  worship and multiply in peace. They conquered the desert; they prospered  with the years that brought settlers, cattle-men, sheep-herders, all  hostile to their religion and their livelihood. Nor did they ever fail  to succor the sick and unfortunate. What are our toils and perils  compared to theirs? Why should we forsake the path of duty, and turn  from mercy because of a cut-throat outlaw? I like not the sign of the  times, but I am a Mormon; I trust in God.\"    \"August Naab, I am a Mormon too,\" returned Cole, \"but my hands are  stained with blood. Soon yours will be if you keep your water-holes and  your cattle. Yes, I know. You're strong, stronger than any of us, far  off in your desert oasis, hemmed in by walls, cut off by canyons,  guarded by your Navajo friends. But Holderness is creeping slowly on  you. He'll ignore your water rights and drive your stock. Soon Dene will  steal cattle under your very eyes. Don't make them enemies.\"    \"I can't pass by this helpless man,\" rolled out August Naab's sonorous  voice.    Suddenly, with livid face and shaking hand, Cole pointed westward.  \"There! Dene and his band! See, under the red wall; see the dust, not  ten miles away. See them?\"    The desert, gray in the foreground, purple in the distance, sloped to  the west. Eyes keen as those of hawks searched the waste, and followed  the red mountain rampart, which, sheer in bold height and processional  in its craggy sweep, shut out the north. Far away little puffs of dust  rose above the white sage, and creeping specks moved at a snail's pace.    \"See them? Ah! then look, August Naab, look in the heavens above for my  prophecy,\" cried Cole, fanatically. \"The red sunset--the sign of the  times--blood!\"    A broad bar of dense black shut out the April sky, except in the extreme  west, where a strip of pale blue formed background for several clouds of  striking color and shape. They alone, in all that expanse, were dyed in  the desert's sunset crimson. The largest projected from behind the dark  cloud-bank in the shape of a huge fist, and the others, small and round,  floated below. To Cole it seemed a giant hand, clutching, with  inexorable strength, a bleeding heart. His terror spread to his  companions as they stared.    Then, as light surrendered to shade, the sinister color faded; the  tracing of the closed hand softened; flush and glow paled, leaving the  sky purple, as if mirroring the desert floor. One golden shaft shot up,  to be blotted out by sudden darkening change, and the sun had set.    \"That may be God's will,\" said August Naab. \"So be it. Martin Cole, take  your men and go.\"    There was a word, half oath, half prayer, and then rattle of stirrups,  the creak of saddles, and clink of spurs, followed by the driving rush  of fiery horses. Cole and his men disappeared in a pall of yellow dust.    A wan smile lightened John Hare's face as he spoke weakly: \"I fear your-  -generous act--can't save me... may bring you harm. I'd rather you left  me--seeing you have women in your party.\"    \"Don't try to talk yet,\" said August Naab. \"You're faint. Here--drink.\"  He stooped to Hare, who was leaning against a sage-bush, and held a  flask to his lips. Rising, he called to his men: \"Make camp, sons. We've  an hour before the outlaws come up, and if they don't go round the sand-  dune we'll have longer.\"    Hare's flagging senses rallied, and he forgot himself in wonder. While  the bustle went on, unhitching of wagon-teams, hobbling and feeding of  horses, unpacking of camp-supplies, Naab appeared to be lost in deep  meditation or prayer. Not once did he glance backward over the trail on  which peril was fast approaching. His gaze was fastened on a ridge to  the east where desert line, fringed by stunted cedars, met the pale-blue  sky, and for a long time he neither spoke nor stirred. At length he  turned to the camp-fire; he raked out red coals, and placed the iron  pots in position, by way of assistance to the women who were preparing  the evening meal.    A cool wind blew in from the desert, rustling the sage, sifting the  sand, fanning the dull coals to burning opals. Twilight failed and night  fell; one by one great stars shone out, cold and bright. From the zone  of blackness surrounding the camp burst the short bark, the hungry  whine, the long-drawn-out wail of desert wolves.    \"Supper, sons,\" called Naab, as he replenished the fire with an armful  of grease-wood.    Naab's sons had his stature, though not his bulk. They were wiry, rangy  men, young, yet somehow old. The desert had multiplied their years. Hare  could not have told one face from another, the bronze skin and steel eye  and hard line of each were so alike. The women, one middle-aged, the  others young, were of comely, serious aspect.    \"Mescal,\" called the Mormon.    A slender girl slipped from one of the covered wagons; she was dark,  supple, straight as an Indian.    August Naab dropped to his knees, and, as the members of his family  bowed their heads, he extended his hands over them and over the food  laid on the ground.    \"Lord, we kneel in humble thanksgiving. Bless this food to our use.  Strengthen us, guide us, keep us as Thou hast in the past. Bless this  stranger within our gates. Help us to help him. Teach us Thy ways, O  Lord--Amen.\"    Hare found himself flushing and thrilling, found himself unable to  control a painful binding in his throat. In forty-eight hours he had  learned to hate the Mormons unutterably; here, in the presence of this  austere man, he felt that hatred wrenched from his heart, and in its  place stirred something warm and living. He was glad, for if he had to  die, as he believed, either from the deed of evil men, or from this last  struggle of his wasted body, he did not want to die in bitterness. That  simple prayer recalled the home he had long since left in Connecticut,  and the time when he used to tease his sister and anger his father and  hurt his mother while grace was being said at the breakfast-table. Now  he was alone in the world, sick and dependent upon the kindness of these  strangers. But they were really friends--it was a wonderful thought.    \"Mescal, wait on the stranger,\" said August Naab, and the girl knelt  beside him, tendering meat and drink. His nerveless fingers refused to  hold the cup, and she put it to his lips while he drank. Hot coffee  revived him; he ate and grew stronger, and readily began to talk when  the Mormon asked for his story.    \"There isn't much to tell. My name is Hare. I am twenty-four. My parents  are dead. I came West because the doctors said I couldn't live in the  East. At first I got better. But my money gave out and work became a  necessity. I tramped from place to place, ending up ill in Salt Lake  City. People were kind to me there. Some one got me a job with a big  cattle company, and sent me to Marysvale, southward over the bleak  plains. It was cold; I was ill when I reached Lund. Before I even knew  what my duties were for at Lund I was to begin work--men called me a  spy. A fellow named Chance threatened me. An innkeeper led me out the  back way, gave me bread and water, and said: 'Take this road to Bane;  it's sixteen miles. If you make it some one'll give you a lift North.' I  walked all night, and all the next day. Then I wandered on till I  dropped here where you found me.\"    \"You missed the road to Bane,\" said Naab. \"This is the trail to White  Sage. It's a trail of sand and stone that leaves no tracks, a lucky  thing for you. Dene wasn't in Lund while you were there--else you  wouldn't be here. He hasn't seen you, and he can't be certain of your  trail. Maybe he rode to Bane, but still we may find a way--\"    One of his sons whistled low, causing Naab to rise slowly, to peer into  the darkness, to listen intently.    \"Here, get up,\" he said, extending a hand to Hare. \"Pretty shaky, eh?  Can you walk? Give me a hold--there.... Mescal, come.\" The slender girl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#1)"],[1,"Team        ARCHITECTURE AND DEMOCRACY    BY    CLAUDE BRAGDON  F.A.I.A.    1918                [Illustration: PLATE I. THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING, NEW YORK]          PREFACE      This book can lay no claim to unity of theme, since its subjects range  from skyscrapers to symbols and soul states; but the author claims for  it nevertheless a unity of point of view, and one (correct or not) so  comprehensive as to include in one synthesis every subject dealt  with. For according to that point of view, a skyscraper is only a  symbol--and of what? A condition of consciousness, that is, a state of  the soul. Democracy even, we are beginning to discover, is a condition  of consciousness too.    Our only hope of understanding the welter of life in which we are  immersed, as in a swift and muddy river, is in ascending as near  to its pure source as we can. That source is in consciousness and  consciousness is in ourselves. This is the point of view from which  each problem dealt with has been attacked; but lest the author be at  once set down as an impracticable dreamer, dwelling aloof in an ivory  tower, the reader should know that his book has been written in  the scant intervals afforded by the practice of the profession of  architecture, so broadened as to include the study of abstract form,  the creation of ornament, experiments with color and light, and such  occasional educational activities as from time to time he has been  called upon to perform at one or another architectural school.    The three essays included under the general heading of \"Democracy  and Architecture\" were prepared at the request of the editor of _The  Architectural Record_, and were published in that journal. The two  following, on \"Ornament from Mathematics,\" represent a recasting and  a rewriting of articles which have appeared in _The Architectural  Review, The Architectural Forum_, and _The American Architect_.  \"Harnessing the Rainbow\" is an address delivered before the Ad. Club  of Cleveland, and the Rochester Rotary Club, and afterwards made into  an essay and published in _The American Architect_ under a different  title. The appreciation of Louis Sullivan as a writer appears here for  the first time, the author having previously paid his respects to Mr.  Sullivan's strictly architectural genius in an essay in _House and  Garden_. \"Color and Ceramics\" was delivered on the occasion of the  dedication of the Ceramic Building of the University of Illinois,  and afterwards published in _The Architectural Forum_. \"Symbols and  Sacraments\" was printed in the English Quarterly _Orpheus_. \"Self  Education\" was delivered before the Boston Architectural Club, and  afterwards published in a number of architectural journals.    Acknowledgment is hereby tendered by the author to the editors of  these various magazines for their consent to republication, together  with thanks, however belated, for their unfailing hospitality to the  children of his brain.

Symbol of Resurrection          Every form of government, every social institution, every  undertaking, however great, however small, every symbol of  enlightenment or degradation, each and all have sprung and are still  springing from the life of the people, and have ever formed and are  now as surely forming images of their thought. Slowly by centuries,  generations, years, days, hours, the thought of the people has  changed; so with precision have their acts responsively changed; thus  thoughts and acts have flowed and are flowing ever onward, unceasingly  onward, involved within the impelling power of Life. Throughout this  stream of human life, and thought, and activity, men have ever felt  the need to build; and from the need arose the power to build. So,  as they thought, they built; for, strange as it may seem, they could  build in no other way. As they built, they made, used, and left behind  them records of their thinking. Then, as through the years new men  came with changed thoughts, so arose new buildings in consonance  with the change of thought--the building always the expression of  the thinking. Whatever the character of the thinking, just so was the  character of the building.    What is Architecture? A Study in the American People of Today, by  LOUIS SULLIVAN.          Architecture and Democracy    I    BEFORE THE WAR      The world war represents not the triumph, but the birth of democracy.  The true ideal of democracy--the rule of a people by the _demos_, or  group soul--is a thing unrealized. How then is it possible to consider  or discuss an architecture of democracy--the shadow of a shade? It is  not possible to do so with any degree of finality, but by an intention  of consciousness upon this juxtaposition of ideas--architecture and  democracy--signs of the times may yield new meanings, relations may  emerge between things apparently unrelated, and the future, always  existent in every present moment, may be evoked by that strange magic  which resides in the human mind.    Architecture, at its worst as at its best, reflects always a true  image of the thing that produced it; a building is revealing even  though it is false, just as the face of a liar tells the thing  his words endeavor to conceal. This being so, let us make such  architecture as is ours declare to us our true estate.    The architecture of the United States, from the period of the Civil  War, up to the beginning of the present crisis, everywhere reflects a  struggle to be free of a vicious and depraved form of feudalism,  grown strong under the very aegis of democracy. The qualities that made  feudalism endeared and enduring; qualities written in beauty on  the cathedral cities of mediaeval Europe--faith, worship,  loyalty, magnanimity--were either vanished or banished from this  pseudo-democratic, aridly scientific feudalism, leaving an inheritance  of strife and tyranny--a strife grown mean, a tyranny grown prudent,  but full of sinister power the weight of which we have by no means  ceased to feel.    Power, strangely mingled with timidity; ingenuity, frequently  misdirected; ugliness, the result of a false ideal of beauty--these  in general characterize the architecture of our immediate past; an  architecture \"without ancestry or hope of posterity,\" an architecture  devoid of coherence or conviction; willing to lie, willing to steal.  What impression such a city as Chicago or Pittsburgh might have made  upon some denizen of those cathedral-crowned feudal cities of the  past we do not know. He would certainly have been amazed at its giant  energy, and probably revolted at its grimy dreariness. We are wont  to pity the mediaeval man for the dirt he lived in, even while smoke  greys our sky and dirt permeates the very air we breathe: we think of  castles as grim and cathedrals as dim, but they were beautiful and gay  with color compared with the grim, dim canyons of our city streets.    Lafcadio Hearn, in _A Conservative_, has sketched for us, with a  sympathy truly clairvoyant, the impression made by the cities of the  West upon the consciousness of a young Japanese samurai educated under  a feudalism not unlike that of the Middle Ages, wherein was worship,  reverence, poetry, loyalty--however strangely compounded with the more  sinister products of the feudal state.        Larger than all anticipation the West appeared to him,--a      world of giants; and that which depresses even the boldest      Occidental who finds himself, without means or friends, alone      in a great city, must often have depressed the Oriental exile:      that vague uneasiness aroused by the sense of being invisible      to hurrying millions; by the ceaseless roar of traffic      drowning voices; by monstrosities of architecture without a      soul; by the dynamic display of wealth forcing mind and      hand, as mere cheap machinery, to the uttermost limits of      the possible. Perhaps he saw such cities as Dore saw London:      sullen majesty of arched glooms, and granite deeps opening      into granite deeps beyond range of vision, and mountains      of masonry with seas of labor in turmoil at their base, and      monumental spaces displaying the grimness of ordered power      slow-gathering through centuries. Of beauty there was nothing      to make appeal to him between those endless cliffs of stone      which walled out the sunrise and the sunset, the sky and the      wind.    The view of our pre-war architecture thus sketchily presented is sure  to be sharply challenged in certain quarters, but unfortunately for  us all this is no mere matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact. The  buildings are there, open to observation; rooted to the spot, they  cannot"]]]
