Introduction    The author does not intend to apologize for what many readers may  call the \"brutality\" of the story; but rather to explain that its  wild spirit is true to the life of the Western border as it was  known only a little more than one hundred years ago.    The writer is the fortunate possessor of historical material of  undoubted truth and interest. It is the long-lost journal of Colonel  Ebenezer Zane, one of the most prominent of the hunter-pioneer, who  labored in the settlement of the Western country.    The story of that tragic period deserves a higher place in  historical literature than it has thus far been given, and this  unquestionably because of a lack of authentic data regarding the  conquering of the wilderness. Considering how many years the  pioneers struggled on the border of this country, the history of  their efforts is meager and obscure.    If the years at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the  nineteenth century were full of stirring adventure on the part of  the colonists along the Atlantic coast, how crowded must they have  been for the almost forgotten pioneers who daringly invaded the  trackless wilds! None there was to chronicle the fight of these  sturdy, travelers toward the setting sun. The story of their stormy  lives, of their heroism, and of their sacrifice for the benefit of  future generations is too little known.    It is to a better understanding of those days that the author has  labored to draw from his ancestor's notes a new and striking  portrayal of the frontier; one which shall paint the fever of  freedom, that powerful impulse which lured so many to unmarked  graves; one which shall show his work, his love, the effect of the  causes which rendered his life so hard, and surely one which does  not forget the wronged Indian.    The frontier in 1777 produced white men so savage as to be men in  name only. These outcasts and renegades lived among the savages, and  during thirty years harassed the border, perpetrating all manner of  fiendish cruelties upon the settlers. They were no less cruel to the  redmen whom they ruled, and at the height of their bloody careers  made futile the Moravian missionaries' long labors, and destroyed  the beautiful hamlet of the Christian Indians, called Gnaddenhutten,  or Village of Peace.    And while the border produced such outlaws so did it produce hunters  Eke Boone, the Zanes, the McCollochs, and Wetzel, that strange,  silent man whose deeds are still whispered in the country where he  once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades, and  who was purely a product of the times. Civilization could not have  brought forth a man like Wetzel. Great revolutions, great crises,  great moments come, and produce the men to deal with them.    The border needed Wetzel. The settlers would have needed many more  years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him. He  was never a pioneer; but always a hunter after Indians. When not on  the track of the savage foe, he was in the settlement, with his keen  eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy. To the superstitious  Indians he was a shadow; a spirit of the border, which breathed  menace from the dark forests. To the settlers he was the right arm  of defense, a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring  frontiersmen who made the settlement of the West a possibility.    And if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as  he truly was, loved by pioneers, respected and feared by redmen, and  hated by renegades; if it softens a little the ruthless name history  accords him, the writer will have been well repaid.    Z. G.        The Spirit of the Border        Chapter I.    \"Nell, I'm growing powerful fond of you.\"    \"So you must be, Master Joe, if often telling makes it true.\"    The girl spoke simply, and with an absence of that roguishness which  was characteristic of her. Playful words, arch smiles, and a touch  of coquetry had seemed natural to Nell; but now her grave tone and  her almost wistful glance disconcerted Joe.    During all the long journey over the mountains she had been gay and  bright, while now, when they were about to part, perhaps never to  meet again, she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her  character. It checked his boldness as nothing else had done.  Suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a woman's love when  she bestows it without reservation. Silenced by the thought that he  had not understood her at all, and the knowledge that he had been  half in sport, he gazed out over the wild country before them.    The scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought  more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway  of the unknown West; that somewhere beyond this rude frontier  settlement, out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and  silent before them, was to be their future home.    From the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed  gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit  of land between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Here these  swift streams merged and formed the broad Ohio. The new-born river,  even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain  of its far-away grandeur, swept majestically round a wide curve and  apparently lost itself in the forest foliage.    On the narrow point of land commanding a view of the rivers stood a  long, low structure enclosed by a stockade fence, on the four  corners of which were little box-shaped houses that bulged out as if  trying to see what was going on beneath. The massive timbers used in  the construction of this fort, the square, compact form, and the  small, dark holes cut into the walls, gave the structure a  threatening, impregnable aspect.    Below Nell and Joe, on the bank, were many log cabins. The yellow  clay which filled the chinks between the logs gave these a peculiar  striped appearance. There was life and bustle in the vicinity of  these dwellings, in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the  neighboring forests. There were canvas-covered wagons around which  curly-headed youngsters were playing. Several horses were grazing on  the short grass, and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that  had been thrown to them. The smoke of many fires curled upward, and  near the blaze hovered ruddy-faced women who stirred the contents of  steaming kettles. One man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep, and  the clean, sharp strokes rang on the air; another hammered stakes  into the ground on which to hang a kettle. Before a large cabin a  fur-trader was exhibiting his wares to three Indians. A second  redskin was carrying a pack of pelts from a canoe drawn up on the  river bank. A small group of persons stood near; some were  indifferent, and others gazed curiously at the savages. Two children  peeped from behind their mother's skirts as if half-curious,  half-frightened.    From this scene, the significance of which had just dawned on him,  Joe turned his eyes again to his companion. It was a sweet face he  saw; one that was sedate, but had a promise of innumerable smiles.  The blue eyes could not long hide flashes of merriment. The girl  turned, and the two young people looked at each other. Her eyes  softened with a woman's gentleness as they rested upon him, for,  broad of shoulder, and lithe and strong as a deer stalker, he was  good to look at.    \"Listen,\" she said. \"We have known each other only three weeks.  Since you joined our wagon-train, and have been so kind to me and so  helpful to make that long, rough ride endurable, you have won my  regard. I--I cannot say more, even if I would. You told me you ran  away from your Virginian home to seek adventure on the frontier, and  that you knew no one in all this wild country. You even said you  could not, or would not, work at farming. Perhaps my sister and I  are as unfitted as you for this life; but we must cling to our uncle  because he is the only relative we have. He has come out here to  join the Moravians, and to preach the gospel to these Indians. We  shall share his life, and help him all we can. You have been telling  me you--you cared for me, and now that we are about to part I--I  don't know what to say to you--unless it is: Give up this intention  of yours to seek adventure, and come with us. It seems to me you  need not hunt for excitement here; it will come unsought.\"    \"I wish I were Jim,\" said he, suddenly.    \"Who is Jim?\"    \"My brother.\"    \"Tell me of him.\"    \"There's nothing much to tell. He and I are all that are left of our  people, as are you and Kate of yours. Jim's a preacher, and the best  fellow--oh! I cared a lot for Jim.\"    \"Then, why did you leave him?\"    \"I was tired of Williamsburg--I quarreled with a fellow, and hurt  him. Besides, I wanted to see the West; I'd like to hunt deer and  bear and fight Indians. Oh, I'm not much good.\"    \"Was Jim the only one you cared for?\" asked Nell, smiling. She was  surprised to find him grave.    \"Yes, except my horse and dog, and I had to leave them behind,\"  answered Joe, bowing his head a little.    \"You'd like to be Jim because he's a preacher, and could help uncle  convert the Indians?\"    \"Yes, partly that, but mostly because--somehow--something you've  said or done has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],[0,"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#1)"],[1,"FACTA DUCIS VIVENT OPEROGAQUE    GLORIA RERUM.--OVID, IN LIVIAM 185        THE HERO'S DEEDS AND HARD-WON    FAME SHALL LIVE.

The greater portion of the following pages were completed before the  death of Prince Bismarck; I take this opportunity of apologising to the  publishers and the editor of the series, for the unavoidable delay which  has caused publication to be postponed for a year.    During this period, two works have appeared to which some reference is  necessary. The value of Busch's _Memoirs_ has been much exaggerated;  except for quite the last years of Bismarck's life they contain little  new information which is of any importance. Not only had a large portion  of the book already been published in Busch's two earlier books, but  many of the anecdotes and documents in those parts which were new had  also been published elsewhere.    Bismarck's own _Memoirs_ have a very different value: not so much  because of the new facts which they record, but because of the light  they throw on Bismarck's character and on the attitude he adopted  towards men and political problems. With his letters and speeches, they  will always remain the chief source for our knowledge of his inner life.    The other authorities are so numerous that it is impossible here to  enumerate even the more important. I must, however, express the  gratitude which all students of Bismarck's career owe to Horst Kohl; in  his _Bismarck-Regesten_ he has collected and arranged the material so as  infinitely to lighten the labours of all others who work in the same  field. His _Bismarck-Jahrbuch_ is equally indispensable; without this it  would be impossible for anyone living in England to use the innumerable  letters, documents, and anecdotes which each year appear in German  periodicals. Of collections of documents and letters, the most important  are those by Herr v. Poschinger, especially the volumes containing the  despatches written from Frankfort and those dealing with Bismarck's  economic and financial policy. A full collection of Bismarck's  correspondence is much wanted; there is now a good edition of the  private letters, edited by Kohl, but no satisfactory collection of the  political letters.    For diplomatic history between 1860 and 1870, I have, of course, chiefly  depended on Sybel; but those who are acquainted with the recent course  of criticism in Germany will not be surprised if, while accepting his  facts, I have sometimes ventured to differ from his conclusions.

CHAPTER I.    BIRTH AND PARENTAGE.      Otto Eduard Leopold Von Bismarck was born at the manor-house of  Schoenhausen, in the Mark of Brandenburg, on April 1, 1815. Just a month  before, Napoleon had escaped from Elba; and, as the child lay in his  cradle, the peasants of the village, who but half a year ago had  returned from the great campaign in France, were once more called to  arms. A few months passed by; again the King of Prussia returned at the  head of his army; in the village churches the medals won at Waterloo  were hung up by those of Grossbehren and Leipzig. One more victory had  been added to the Prussian flags, and then a profound peace fell upon  Europe; fifty years were to go by before a Prussian army again marched  out to meet a foreign foe.    The name and family of Bismarck were among the oldest in the land. Many  of the great Prussian statesmen have come from other countries: Stein  was from Nassau, and Hardenberg was a subject of the Elector of Hanover;  even Bluecher and Schwerin were Mecklenburgers, and the Moltkes belong to  Holstein. The Bismarcks are pure Brandenburgers; they belong to the old  Mark, the district ruled over by the first Margraves who were sent by  the Emperor to keep order on the northern frontier; they were there two  hundred years before the first Hohenzollern came to the north.    The first of the name of whom we hear was Herbort von Bismarck, who, in  1270, was Master of the Guild of the Clothiers in the city of Stendal.  The town had been founded about one hundred years before by Albert the  Bear, and men had come in from the country around to enjoy the  privileges and security of city life. Doubtless Herbort or his father  had come from Bismarck, a village about twenty miles to the west, which  takes its name either from the little stream, the Biese, which runs near  it, or from the bishop in whose domain it lay. He was probably the first  to bear the name, which would have no meaning so long as he remained in  his native place, for the _von_ was still a mark of origin and had not  yet become the sign of nobility. Other emigrants from Bismarck seem also  to have assumed it; in the neighbouring town of Prenzlau the name  occurs, and it is still found among the peasants of the Mark; as the  Wends were driven back and the German invasion spread, more adventurous  colonists migrated beyond the Oder and founded a new Bismarck in  Pomerania.    Of the lineage of Herbort we know nothing[1]; his ancestors must have  been among the colonists who had been planted by the Emperors on the  northern frontier to occupy the land conquered from the heathen. He  seems himself to have been a man of substance and position; he already  used the arms, the double trefoil, which are still borne by all the  branches of his family. His descendants are often mentioned in the  records of the Guild; his son or grandson, Rudolph or Rule, represented  the town in a conflict with the neighbouring Dukes of Brunswick. It was  his son Nicolas, or Claus as he is generally called, who founded the  fortunes of the family; he attached himself closely to the cause of the  Margrave, whom he supported in his troubles with the Duke of Brunswick,  and whose interests he represented in the Town Council. He was amply  rewarded for his fidelity. After a quarrel between the city and the  Prince, Bismarck left his native home and permanently entered the  service of the Margrave. Though probably hitherto only a simple citizen,  he was enfiefed with the castle of Burgstall, an important post, for it  was situated on the borders of the Mark and the bishopric of"]]]
