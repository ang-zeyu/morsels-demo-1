VOL. 10, No. 275.] SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1827. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          KEW PALACE.    [Illustration: Kew Palace.]      Innumerable are the instances of princes having sought to perpetuate  their memories by the building of palaces, from the _Domus Aurea_,  or golden house of Nero, to the comparatively puny structures of our  own times. As specimens of modern magnificence and substantial comfort,  the latter class of edifices may be admirable; but we are bound to  acknowledge, that in boldness and splendour of design, they cannot  assimilate to the labours of antiquity, much of whose stupendous  character is to this day preserved in many series of interesting  ruins:--      Whilst in the progress of the long decay,    Thrones sink to dust, and nations pass away.    As a record of this degeneracy, near the western corner of Kew Green  stands the new palace, commenced for George III., under the direction  of the late James Wyatt, Esq. The north front, the only part open to  public inspection, possesses an air of solemn, sullen grandeur; but it  very ill accords with the taste and science generally displayed by its  nominal architect.    To quote the words of a contemporary, \"this Anglo-Teutonic,  castellated, gothized structure must be considered as an abortive  production, at once illustrative of bad taste and defective judgment.  From the small size of the windows and the diminutive proportion of  its turrets, it would seem to possess     \"'Windows that exclude the light,     And passages that lead to nothing.'\"    Upon the unhappy seclusion of the _royal_ architect, the works were  suspended, and it now remains unfinished. Censure and abuse have,  however, always been abundantly lavished on its architecture, whether  it be the result of royal caprice or of professional study; but the  taste of either party deserves to be taxed with its demerits.    The northern front was intended to be appropriated to the use of  domestics; the whole building is rendered nearly indestructible by  fire, by means of cast-iron joists and rafters, &c., certainly in this  case an unnecessary precaution, since the whole pile is shortly to be  pulled down. The foundation, too, is in a bog close to the Thames,  and the principal object in its view is the dirty town of Brentford,  on the opposite side of the river; a selection, it would seem, of  _family_ taste, for George II. is known to have often said,  when riding through Brentford, \"I do like this place, it's so like  Yarmany.\"    A modern tourist, in \"A Morning's Walk from London to Kew,\"  characterizes the new palace as \"the _Bastile palace_, from its  resemblance to that building, so obnoxious to freedom and freemen. On  a former occasion,\" says he, \"I have viewed its interior, and I am at  a loss to conceive the motive for preferring an external form, which  rendered it impracticable to construct within it more than a series of  large closets, boudoirs, and rooms like oratories.\" The latter part of  this censure is judiciously correct; but the epithet \"bastile\" is  perhaps too harsh for some ears.    The _old palace_ at Kew formerly belonged to the Capel family, and  by marriage became the property of Samuel Molyneux, Esq., secretary  to George II. when prince of Wales. The late Frederic, prince of Wales,  took a long lease of the house, which he made his frequent residence;  and here, too, occasionally resided his favourite poet, James Thomson,  author of \"The Seasons.\" It is now held by his majesty on the same  tenure. The house contains some good pictures, among which is a set of  Canaletti's works; the celebrated picture of the Florence gallery, by  Zoffany, (who resided in the neighbourhood,) was removed several years  since. The pleasure-grounds, which contain 120 acres, were laid out by  Sir William Chambers, one of the greatest masters of ornamental  English gardening. Altogether they form a most delightful suburban  retreat, and we hope to take an early opportunity of noticing them  more in detail.    The old mansion opposite the palace was taken on a long lease by  Queen Caroline of the descendants of Sir Richard Lovett, and has been  inhabited by different branches of the royal family: and here his  present majesty was educated, under the superintendance of the late  Dr. Markham, archbishop of York. This house was bought, in 1761, for  the late Queen Charlotte, who died here November 17, 1818.    Apart from these courtly attractions, Kew is one of the most  interesting of the villages near London. On Kew Green once stood a  house, the favourite retirement of Sir Peter Lely. In the church and  cemetery, too, are interred Meyer, the celebrated miniature-painter,  Gainsborough, and Zoffany. Their tombs are simple and unostentatious;  but other and more splendid memorials are left to record their genius.    The premature fate of Kew Palace renders  it at this moment an object of public  curiosity; while the annexed engraving  may serve to identify its site, when posterity      \"Asks where the fabric stood.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE NUPTIAL CHARM.    (For the Mirror.)        There is a charm in wedded bliss.    That leaves each rapture cold to this;    There is a soft endearing spell,    That language can but faintly tell.      'Tis not the figure, form, nor face,    'Tis not the manner, air, nor grace,    'Tis not the smile nor sparkling eye,    'Tis not the winning look nor sigh.      There is a charm surpassing these,    A pleasing spell-like pleasure's breeze!    A joy that centres in the heart,    And doth its balmy sweets impart!      'Tis not the lure of beauty's power,    The skin-deep magnet of an hour;    It is--_affection's_ mutual glow,    That does the nuptial charm bestow!      UTOPIA.           *       *       *       *       *        FINE ARTS.      RAPHAEL SANZIO D'URBINO.      In No. 273 of the Mirror, _P.T.W._ has noticed the _Cartoons_  of Raphael; and I therefore solicit the reader's attention to the  subjoined remarks on that master's unsurpassed genius.    Raphael Sanzio d'Urbino was the pupil of Pietro Perugino, but  afterwards studied the works of Leonardo di Vinci and Michael Angelo.  He excelled every modern painter, and was thought to equal the  ancients; though he did not design naked figures with so much  knowledge as Michael Angelo, who was more eminently skilled in  anatomy; neither did he paint in so graceful a style as the Venetians;  but he had a much more happy manner of disposing and choosing his  subjects than any other artist who has lived since his time. His  admirable choice of attitudes, ornaments, draperies, and expression,  can surely never be equalled by the most successful _aspirant_ in the  fine arts. He has an undisputed title to the prince of painters; for,  notwithstanding his premature death, he produced the most enchanting  representations of the sublime and beautiful. A painter will ever  derive much benefit from the study of all Raphael's pictures;  especially from the Martyrdom of Saint Felicitas; the Transfiguration;  Joseph explaining Pharaoh's Dream; and the School of Athens. Among the  wonders of art with which the School of Athens abounds, we may select  that of four youths attending to a sage mathematician, who is  demonstrating some theorem. One of the boys is listening with profound  reverence to the reasoning of his master; another discovers a greater  quickness of apprehension; while the third is endeavouring to explain  it to the last, who stands with a gaping countenance, utterly unable  to comprehend the learned man's discourse. Expression, which was  Raphael's chief excellence, and in which no other master has well  succeeded, may be seen in the above picture to perfection. Besides his  grand historical works, he executed portraits in a good style; and was  also an admirable architect. In person, he was handsome, and  remarkably well made, his manners being polite and unaffected. He  never refused to impart to others what he knew himself; by which  conduct he became esteemed in private, as much as he was adored in  public.    This master's grand works are principally at Rome, in the Vatican; in  the palace, Florence; Versailles; and the Palais Royal, France; the  king's collection, Naples; and in the apartments at Hampton Court  Palace. His best scholars were Julio Romano, Polydore, Giovanni  d'Udine, and Gaudenzio, to all of whom he communicated the grand  _arcana_ of his wonderful art.

Hitherto it has been found that of all the appliances and methods for  separating the liquid from the solid matters, whether it is in the case  of effluents from tanneries and other manufactories, or the ocherous and  muddy sludges taken from the settling tanks in mines, some of which  contain from 90 to 95 per cent. of water, the filter press is the best  and the most economical, and it is to this particular process that  Messrs. Johnson's exhibits at the Health Exhibition, London, chiefly  relate. Our engravings are from _The Engineer_. A filter press consists  of a number of narrow cells of cast iron, shown in Figs. 3 and 4, held  together in a suitable frame, the interior frames being provided with  drainage surfaces communicating with outlets at the bottom, and covered  with a filtering medium, which is generally cloth or paper. The interior  of the cells so built up are in direct communication with each other, or  with a common channel for the introduction of the matter to be filtered,  and as the only exit is through the cloth or paper, the solid portion is  kept back while the liquid passes through and escapes by the drainage  surfaces to the outlets. The cells are subjected to pressure, which  increases as the operation goes on, from the growing resistance offered  by the increasing deposit of solid matter on the cloths; and it is  therefore necessary that they should be provided with a jointing strip  around the outside, and be pressed together sufficiently to prevent any  escape of liquid. In ordinary working both sides of the cell are exposed  to the same pressure, but in some cases the feed passages become choked,  and destroy the equilibrium. This, in the earlier machines, gave rise to  considerable annoyance, as the diaphragms, being thin, readily collapsed  at even moderate pressures; but recently all trouble on this head has  been obviated by introducing the three projections near the center, as  shown in the cuts, which bear upon each other and form a series of stays  from one end of the cells to the other, supporting the plates until the  obstruction is forced away. We give an illustration below showing the  arrangement of a pair of filter presses with pneumatic pressure  apparatus, which has been successfully applied for dealing with sludge  containing a large amount of fibrous matter and rubbish, which could not  be conveniently treated with by pumps in the ordinary way. The sludge is  allowed to gravitate into wrought iron receivers placed below the floor,  and of sufficient size to receive one charge. From these vessels it is  forced into the presses by means of air compressed to from 100 lb. to  120 lb. per square inch, the air being supplied by the horizontal pump  shown in the engraving. The press is thus almost instantaneously filled,  and the whole operation is completed in about an hour, the result being  a hard pressed cake containing about 45 per cent. of water, which can be  easily handled and disposed of as required. The same arrangement is in  use for dealing with sewage sludge, and the advantages of the compressed  air system over the ordinary pumps, as well as the ready and cleanly  method of separating the liquid, will probably commend itself to many of  our readers. We understand that from careful experiments on a large  scale, extending over a period of two years, the cost of filtration,  including all expenses, has been found to be not more than about 6d. per  ton of wet sludge. A number of specimens of waste liquors from factories  with the residual matters pressed into cakes, and also of the purified  effluents, are exhibited. These will prove of interest to many, all the  more so since in some instances the waste products are converted into  materials of value, which, it is stated, will more than repay for the  outlay incurred.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Fig 4.]    Another application of the filter press is in the Porter-Clark process  of softening water, which is shown in operation. We may briefly state  that the chief object is to precipitate the bicarbonates of lime and  magnesia held in solution by the water, and so get rid of what is known  as the temporary hardness. To accomplish this, strong lime water is  introduced in a clear state to the water to be softened, the quantity  being regulated according to the amount of bicarbonates in solution. The  immediate effect of this is that a proportion of the carbonic acid of  the latter combines with the invisible lime of the clear lime water,  forming a chalky precipitate, while the loss of this proportion of  carbonic acid also reduces the invisible bicarbonates into visible  carbonates. The precipitates thus formed are in the state of an  impalpable powder, and in the original Clark process many hours were  required for their subsidence in large settling tanks, which had to be  in duplicate in order to permit of continuous working. By Mr. Porter's  process, however, this is obviated by the use of filter presses, through  which the chalky water is passed, the precipitate being left behind,  while, by means of a special arrangement of cells, the softened and  purified water is discharged under pressure to the service tanks. Large  quantities can thus be dealt with, within small space, and in many cases  no pumping is required, as the resistance of the filtering medium being  small, the ordinary pressure in the main is but little reduced. One of  the apparatus exhibited is designed for use in private mansions, and  will soften and filter 750 gallons a day. In such a case, where it would  probably be inconvenient to apply the usual agitating machinery, special  arrangements have been made by which all the milk of lime for a day's  working is made at one time in a special vessel agitated by hand, on the  evening previous to the day on which it is to be used. Time is thus  given for the particles of lime to settle during the night. The clear  lime water is introduced into the mixing vessel by means of a charge of  air compressed in the top of a receiver, by the action of water from the  main, the air being admitted to the milk of lime vessel through a  suitable regulating valve. A very small filter suffices for removing the  precipitate, and the clear, softened water can either be used at once,  or stored in the usual way. The advantages which would accrue to the  community at large from the general adoption of some cheap method of  reducing the hardness of water are too well known to need much comment  from us.           *       *       *       *       *          PNEUMATIC MALTING.
