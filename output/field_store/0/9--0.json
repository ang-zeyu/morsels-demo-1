Now, however,  there is ample evidence to prove that the entire nation was thoroughly  well informed of the course which events were taking, and also warned as  to the catastrophe to which the national course was certainly leading.    Even to-day, after more than twelve months of devastating warfare, there  is no unity of opinion in Germany as to who caused the war. Some writers  accuse France, others England, while many lay the guilt at Russia's  door. They are only unanimous in charging one or other, or all the  powers, of the Triple Entente. We shall see that every power now at war,  with the exception of Germany and Italy, has been held responsible for  Armageddon, but apparently it has not yet occurred to Germans that the  bearer of guilt for this year's bloodshed--is Germany alone!    It is true that the conflict between Austria and Serbia forms the  starting point. Whether or not Serbia was seriously in the wrong is a  matter of opinion, but it is generally held that Austria dealt with her  neighbour with too much heat and too little discretion. Austria kindled  the flames of war, but it was Germany's mission to seize a blazing torch  and set Europe alight.    When the text of Austria's ultimatum became known, a very serious mood  came over Germany. There was not a man who did not realize that a great  European War loomed on the horizon. A well-organized, healthy public  opinion could at that period have brought the governments of the  Germanic Powers to recognize their responsibility. Had the German Press  been unanimous, it might have stopped the avalanche. But there were two  currents of opinion, the one approving, the other condemning Austria for  having thrown down the gauntlet to Serbia and above all to Russia.    One paper exulted over the statement that every sentence in Austria's  ultimatum \"was a whip-lash across Serbia's face;\" a phrase expressing so  aptly the great mass of popular opinion. This expression met with  unstinted approval, for it corresponded with German ideals and standards  in dealing with an opponent. Yet there was no lack of warnings, and very  grave ones too. A glance at German newspapers will suffice to prove this  statement.    On July 24th, 1914, Krupp's organ, the _Rheinisch-Westfaelische Zeitung_,  contained the following: \"The Austro-Hungarian ultimatum is nothing but  a pretext for war, but this time a dangerous one. It seems that we are  standing on the verge of an Austro-Serbian war. It is possible, very  possible, that we shall have to extinguish East-European conflagrations  with our arms, either because of our treaties or from the compulsion of  events. But it is a scandal if the Imperial Government (Berlin) has not  required that such a final offer should be submitted to it for approval  before its presentation to Serbia. To-day nothing remains for us but to  declare: 'We are not bound by any alliance to support wars let loose by  the Hapsburg policy of conquest.'\"    The _Post_ wrote on the same date: \"Is that a note? No! it is an  ultimatum of the sharpest kind. Within twenty-four hours Austria demands  an answer. A reply? No! but an absolute submission, the utter and  complete humiliation of Serbia. On former occasions we have (and with  justice) made fun of Austria's lack of energy. Now we have a proof of  energy which terrifies us. This 'note' represents about the very  uttermost which can be said to any government, and such things are only  said when the sender of the 'note' has absolutely determined upon war.\"    The principal organ of Germany's largest political party, the Social  Democrats, contained a still more emphatic protest on July 25th. A  telegram from the Belgrade correspondent of the _Vorwaerts_ runs: \"Since  the presentation of Austria's note, public opinion has become  exceedingly serious, although the city is still very calm. The general  view held is that Austria's ultimatum is unacceptable for a sovereign  State. In Belgrade no one doubts that Russia will stand by Serbia.  Everyone is certain that in consequence of Austria's excessively sharp  tone, Russia will not remain inactive should Austria resort to armed  force. The populace is prepared for war.\"    In view of the subsequent attitude of Germany's Social Democrats, an  official proclamation, published in all their seventy-seven daily papers  on July 25th, is of supreme importance. At that date they had apparently  no doubt whatever as to the guilty party. The change of front in the  Reichstag on August 4th would seem in the light of this proclamation, as  nothing other than a betrayal of conscience. Further, the split which  has arisen in their ranks during the war leads to the supposition that  Liebknecht, Kautsky and Bernstein have been troubled by the inward  voice.    This is the full text of the proclamation as it appeared in the  _Vorwaerts_:      \"An Appeal! The Balkan plains are still steaming with the blood of    thousands of murdered; the ruins of desolate towns and devastated    villages are still smoking after the Balkan War; hungry, workless men,    widowed women and orphan children are still wandering through the    land, and yet again Austria's Imperialism unchains the War Fury to    bring death and destruction over all Europe.      \"Even if we condemn the doings of the Greater-Serbian Nationalists,    still the wicked war-provocation of the Austro-Hungarian Government    calls forth the most stinging protest. The demands made by this    government are so brutal, that in the history of the world their like    has never been presented to an independent State, and they can only be    calculated to provoke war.      \"Germany's proletariat, conscious of its mission, raises herewith, in    the name of humanity and civilization, the most fervent protest    against this criminal action of the war party (_Kriegshetzer_). It    (the Social Democratic Party) demands imperatively that the German    Government should exercise all its influence on the Austrian    Government to preserve peace, and in case this infamous war cannot be    prevented then to abstain from any warlike interference. No single    drop of blood of a single German soldier may be sacrificed to gratify    the lust for power of the Austrian autocracy, the Imperial    profit-interests.      \"Comrades! we call upon you to give expression to the working-classes'    unshakable will for peace in mass meetings. This is a serious moment,    more solemn than any in the last few decades. There is danger in    delay. A world war threatens us. The ruling classes who enslave,    despise and exploit you in times of peace desire now to misuse you as    cannon-fodder. From all sides the cry must ring in the ears of those    in authority: We don't want war! Down with war!      \"Long live international brotherhood!      \"Berlin, July 25th, 1914.      \"_The Leaders of the Party_.\"    Two days later the _Leipziger Tageblatt_ announced that the Public  Prosecutor had commenced proceedings against the editors of _Vorwaerts_  for having distributed the above appeal in pamphlet form in the streets  of Berlin. From this fact we may conclude that the charges thrown out by  the Social Democratic Party were by no means congenial to the plans of  the German Government.    The Liberal _Berliner Tageblatt_ (July 24th), gave its unreserved  support to Austria's action. \"The Austrian Government has voiced its  demands in a calm and serious tone which contains nothing offensive to  the Serbian monarchy. Everyone who has considered the results of the  inquiry into the tragedy of Serajewo, and the burrowing of Serbian  propagandists in Austria, must give his absolute sanction to the  latter's demands. Much as every right-thinking man must desire that  peace should be preserved, still he must admit that Austria could not  have acted otherwise.\"    Even the _Vossische Zeitung_, the organ of army circles, was more  conservative in its judgment. In the issue for July 24th a leading  article runs: \"It cannot be denied that nearly every point raised by  Austria in her note is an encroachment on Serbia's sovereign rights.  Austria appears as the policeman, who undertakes to create order in  Serbia, because the Serbian Government, according to Austria's claim, is  unable to hold in check those 'subversive elements' within its  frontiers, which disturb Austria's peace. But only in this manner can  Austria protect herself against the criminals who are sent from Serbia  to the territories of the Hapsburg monarchy. No consideration whatever  can be shown to Serbia, as Austria's first duty is self-defence.\"    In the German Press two widely-differing opinions found expression with  regard to the equity of Austria's demands, but the Press and people were  unanimous in believing that if these demands were ruthlessly pressed  home they could only lead to a European conflagration.    In view of this latter danger, national opinion was again divided"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#1)"],[1,"GREY        THE DESERT    of    WHEAT    1919            CHAPTER I    Late in June the vast northwestern desert of wheat began to take on a  tinge of gold, lending an austere beauty to that endless, rolling,  smooth world of treeless hills, where miles of fallow ground and miles  of waving grain sloped up to the far-separated homes of the heroic men  who had conquered over sage and sand.    These simple homes of farmers seemed lost on an immensity of soft gray  and golden billows of land, insignificant dots here and there on distant  hills, so far apart that nature only seemed accountable for those broad  squares of alternate gold and brown, extending on and on to the waving  horizon-line. A lonely, hard, heroic country, where flowers and fruit  were not, nor birds and brooks, nor green pastures. Whirling strings of  dust looped up over fallow ground, the short, dry wheat lay back from  the wind, the haze in the distance was drab and smoky, heavy with  substance.    A thousand hills lay bare to the sky, and half of every hill was wheat  and half was fallow ground; and all of them, with the shallow valleys  between, seemed big and strange and isolated. The beauty of them was  austere, as if the hand of man had been held back from making green his  home site, as if the immensity of the task had left no time for youth  and freshness. Years, long years, were there in the round-hilled,  many-furrowed gray old earth. And the wheat looked a century old. Here  and there a straight, dusty road stretched from hill to hill, becoming a  thin white line, to disappear in the distance. The sun shone hot, the  wind blew hard; and over the boundless undulating expanse hovered a  shadow that was neither hood of dust nor hue of gold. It was not  physical, but lonely, waiting, prophetic, and weird. No wild desert of  wastelands, once the home of other races of man, and now gone to decay  and death, could have shown so barren an acreage. Half of this wandering  patchwork of squares was earth, brown and gray, curried and disked, and  rolled and combed and harrowed, with not a tiny leaf of green in all the  miles. The other half had only a faint golden promise of mellow harvest;  and at long distance it seemed to shimmer and retreat under the hot sun.  A singularly beautiful effect of harmony lay in the long, slowly rising  slopes, in the rounded hills, in the endless curving lines on all sides.  The scene was heroic because of the labor of horny hands; it was sublime  because not a hundred harvests, nor three generations of toiling men,  could ever rob nature of its limitless space and scorching sun and  sweeping dust, of its resistless age-long creep back toward the desert  that it had been.           *       *       *       *       *    Here was grown the most bounteous, the richest and finest wheat in all  the world. Strange and unfathomable that so much of the bread of man,  the staff of life, the hope of civilization in this tragic year 1917,  should come from a vast, treeless, waterless, dreary desert!    This wonderful place was an immense valley of considerable altitude  called the Columbia Basin, surrounded by the Cascade Mountains on the  west, the Coeur d'Alene and Bitter Root Mountains on the east, the  Okanozan range to the north, and the Blue Mountains to the south. The  valley floor was basalt, from the lava flow of volcanoes in ages past.  The rainfall was slight except in the foot-hills of the mountains. The  Columbia River, making a prodigious and meandering curve, bordered on  three sides what was known as the Bend country. South of this vast area,  across the range, began the fertile, many-watered region that extended  on down into verdant Oregon. Among the desert hills of this Bend  country, near the center of the Basin, where the best wheat was raised,  lay widely separated little towns, the names of which gave evidence of  the mixed population. It was, of course, an exceedingly prosperous  country, a fact manifest in the substantial little towns, if not in the  crude and unpretentious homes of the farmers. The acreage of farms ran  from a section, six hundred and forty acres, up into the thousands.           *       *       *       *       *    Upon a morning in early July, exactly three months after the United  States had declared war upon Germany, a sturdy young farmer strode with  darkly troubled face from the presence of his father. At the end of a  stormy scene he had promised his father that he would abandon his desire  to enlist in the army.    Kurt Dorn walked away from the gray old clapboard house, out to the  fence, where he leaned on the gate. He could see for miles in every  direction, and to the southward, away on a long yellow slope, rose a  stream of dust from a motor-car.    \"Must be Anderson--coming to dun father,\" muttered young Dorn.    This was the day, he remembered, when the wealthy rancher of Ruxton was  to look over old Chris Dorn's wheat-fields. Dorn owed thirty-thousand  dollars and interest for years, mostly to Anderson. Kurt hated the debt  and resented the visit, but he could not help acknowledging that the  rancher had been lenient and kind. Long since Kurt had sorrowfully  realized that his father was illiterate, hard, grasping, and growing  worse with the burden of years.    \"If we had rain now--or soon--that section of Bluestem would square  father,\" soliloquized young Dorn, as with keen eyes he surveyed a vast  field of wheat, short, smooth, yellowing in the sun. But the cloudless  sky, the haze of heat rather betokened a continued drought.    There were reasons, indeed, for Dorn to wear a dark and troubled face as  he watched the motor-car speed along ahead of its stream of dust, pass  out of sight under the hill, and soon reappear, to turn off the main  road and come toward the house. It was a big, closed car, covered with  dust. The driver stopped it at the gate and got out.    \"Is this Chris Dorn's farm?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" replied Kurt.    Whereupon the door of the car opened and out stepped a short, broad man  in a long linen coat.    \"Come out, Lenore, an' shake off the dust,\" he said, and he assisted a  young woman to step out. She also wore a long linen coat, and a veil  besides. The man removed his coat and threw it into the car. Then he  took off his sombrero to beat the dust off of that.    \"Phew! The Golden Valley never seen dust like this in a million  years!... I'm chokin' for water. An' listen to the car. She's boilin'!\"    Then, as he stepped toward Kurt, the rancher showed himself to be a  well-preserved man of perhaps fifty-five, of powerful form beginning to  sag in the broad shoulders, his face bronzed by long exposure to wind  and sun. He had keen gray eyes, and their look was that of a man used to  dealing with his kind and well disposed toward them.    \"Hello! Are you young Dorn?\" he asked.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Kurt, stepping out.    \"I'm Anderson, from Ruxton, come to see your dad. This is my girl  Lenore.\"    Kurt acknowledged the slight bow from the veiled young woman, and then,  hesitating, he added, \"Won't you come in?\"    \"No, not yet. I'm chokin' for air an' water. Bring us a drink,\" replied  Anderson.    Kurt hurried away to get a bucket and tin cup. As he drew water from the  well he was thinking rather vaguely that it was somehow  embarrassing--the fact of Mr. Anderson being accompanied by his  daughter. Kurt was afraid of his father. But then, what did it matter?  When he returned to the yard he found the rancher sitting in the shade  of one of the few apple-trees, and the young lady was standing near, in  the act of removing bonnet and veil. She had thrown the linen coat over  the seat of an old wagon-bed that lay near.    \"Good water is scarce here, but I'm glad we have some,\" said Kurt; then  as he set down the bucket and offered a brimming cupful to the girl he  saw her face, and his eyes met hers. He dropped the cup and stared. Then  hurriedly, with flushing face, he bent over to recover and refill it.    \"Ex-excuse me. I'm--clumsy,\" he managed to say, and as he handed the cup  to her he averted his gaze. For more than a year the memory of this very  girl had haunted him. He had seen her twice--the first time at the close  of his one year of college at the University of California, and the  second time on the street in Spokane. In a glance he had recognized the  strong, lithe figure, the sunny hair, the rare golden tint of her  complexion, the blue eyes, warm and direct. And he had sustained a shock  which momentarily confused him.    \"Good water, hey?\" dissented Anderson, after drinking a second cup. \"Boy  that's wet, but it ain't water to drink. Come down in the foot-hills an'  I'll show you. My ranch 's called 'Many Waters,' an' you can't keep your  feet dry.\"    \"I wish we had some of it here,\" replied Kurt, wistfully, and he waved a  hand at the broad, swelling slopes. The warm breath that blew in from  the wheatlands felt dry and smelled dry.    \"You're in for a dry spell?\" inquired Anderson, with interest that was  keen, and kindly as well.    \"Father says so. And I fear it, too--for he never makes a mistake in  weather or crops.\"    \"A hot, dry spell!... This summer?... Hum!... Boy, do you know that  wheat is the most important thing in the world to-day?\"    \"You mean on account of the war,\" replied Kurt. \"Yes, I know. But father  doesn't see that. All he sees is--if we have rain we'll have bumper  crops. That big field there would be a record--at war prices.... And he  wouldn't be ruined!\"    \"Ruined?... Oh, he means I'd close on him.... Hum!... Say, what do you  see in a big wheat yield--if it rains?\"    \"Mr. Anderson, I'd like to see our debt paid, but I'm thinking most of  wheat for starving peoples. I--I've studied this wheat question. It's  the biggest question in this war.\"    Kurt had forgotten the girl and was unaware of her eyes bent steadily  upon him. Anderson had roused to the interest of wheat, and to a"]]]
