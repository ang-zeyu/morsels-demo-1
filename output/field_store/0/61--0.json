Lorentz of the University of Leyden            NOTE    Whether it is true or not that not more than twelve persons in all the  world are able to understand Einstein's Theory, it is nevertheless  a fact that there is a constant demand for information about this  much-debated topic of relativity. The books published on the subject  are so technical that only a person trained in pure physics and  higher mathematics is able to fully understand them. In order to  make a popular explanation of this far-reaching theory available,  the present book is published.    Professor Lorentz is credited by Einstein with sharing the development  of his theory. He is doubtless better able than any other man--except  the author himself--to explain this scientific discovery.    The publishers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to the New  York Times, The Review of Reviews and The Athenaeum for courteous  permission to reprint articles from their pages. Professor Lorentz's  article appeared originally in The Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant of  November 19, 1919.        INTRODUCTION    The action of the Royal Society at its meeting in London on November  6, in recognizing Dr. Albert Einstein's \"theory of relativity\"  has caused a great stir in scientific circles on both sides of the  Atlantic. Dr. Einstein propounded his theory nearly fifteen years  ago. The present revival of interest in it is due to the remarkable  confirmation which it received in the report of the observations  made during the sun's eclipse of last May to determine whether rays  of light passing close to the sun are deflected from their course.    The actual deflection of the rays that was discovered by the  astronomers was precisely what had been predicted theoretically by  Einstein many years since. This striking confirmation has led certain  German scientists to assert that no scientific discovery of such  importance has been made since Newton's theory of gravitation was  promulgated. This suggestion, however, was put aside by Dr. Einstein  himself when he was interviewed by a correspondent of the New York  Times at his home in Berlin. To this correspondent he expressed the  difference between his conception and the law of gravitation in the  following terms:    \"Please imagine the earth removed, and in its place suspended a box as  big as a room or a whole house, and inside a man naturally floating  in the center, there being no force whatever pulling him. Imagine,  further, this box being, by a rope or other contrivance, suddenly  jerked to one side, which is scientifically termed 'difform motion',  as opposed to 'uniform motion.' The person would then naturally reach  bottom on the opposite side. The result would consequently be the  same as if he obeyed Newton's law of gravitation, while, in fact,  there is no gravitation exerted whatever, which proves that difform  motion will in every case produce the same effects as gravitation.    \"I have applied this new idea to every kind of difform motion and  have thus developed mathematical formulas which I am convinced give  more precise results than those based on Newton's theory. Newton's  formulas, however, are such close approximations that it was difficult  to find by observation any obvious disagreement with experience.\"    Dr. Einstein, it must be remembered, is a physicist and not an  astronomer. He developed his theory as a mathematical formula. The  confirmation of it came from the astronomers. As he himself says, the  crucial test was supplied by the last total solar eclipse. Observations  then proved that the rays of fixed stars, having to pass close to  the sun to reach the earth, were deflected the exact amount demanded  by Einstein's formulas. The deflection was also in the direction  predicted by him.    The question must have occurred to many, what has all this to do with  relativity? When this query was propounded by the Times correspondent  to Dr. Einstein he replied as follows:    \"The term relativity refers to time and space. According to Galileo and  Newton, time and space were absolute entities, and the moving systems  of the universe were dependent on this absolute time and space. On  this conception was built the science of mechanics. The resulting  formulas sufficed for all motions of a slow nature; it was found,  however, that they would not conform to the rapid motions apparent  in electrodynamics.    \"This led the Dutch professor, Lorentz, and myself to develop  the theory of special relativity. Briefly, it discards absolute  time and space and makes them in every instance relative to moving  systems. By this theory all phenomena in electrodynamics, as well as  mechanics, hitherto irreducible by the old formulae--and there are  multitudes--were satisfactorily explained.    \"Till now it was believed that time and space existed by themselves,  even if there was nothing else--no sun, no earth, no stars--while  now we know that time and space are not the vessel for the universe,  but could not exist at all if there were no contents, namely, no sun,  earth and other celestial bodies.    \"This special relativity, forming the first part of my theory,  relates to all systems moving with uniform motion; that is, moving  in a straight line with equal velocity.    \"Gradually I was led to the idea, seeming a very paradox in science,  that it might apply equally to all moving systems, even of difform  motion, and thus I developed the conception of general relativity  which forms the second part of my theory.\"    As summarized by an American astronomer, Professor Henry Norris  Russell, of Princeton, in the Scientific American for November 29,  Einstein's contribution amounts to this:    \"The central fact which has been proved--and which is of great interest  and importance--is that the natural phenomena involving gravitation  and inertia (such as the motions of the planets) and the phenomena  involving electricity and magnetism (including the motion of light)  are not independent of one another, but are intimately related, so  that both sets of phenomena should be regarded as parts of one vast  system, embracing all Nature. The relation of the two is, however, of  such a character that it is perceptible only in a very few instances,  and then only to refined observations.\"    Already before the war, Einstein had immense fame among physicists,  and among all who are interested in the philosophy of science,  because of his principle of relativity.    Clerk Maxwell had shown that light is electro-magnetic, and had reduced  the whole theory of electro-magnetism to a small number of equations,  which are fundamental in all subsequent work. But these equations  were entangled with the hypothesis of the ether, and with the notion  of motion relative to the ether. Since the ether was supposed to be  at rest, such motion was indistinguishable from absolute motion. The  motion of the earth relatively to the ether should have been different  at different points of its orbit, and measurable phenomena should  have resulted from this difference. But none did, and all attempts to  detect effects of motions relative to the ether failed. The theory of  relativity succeeded in accounting for this fact. But it was necessary  incidentally to throw over the one universal time, and substitute  local times attached to moving bodies and varying according to their  motion. The equations on which the theory of relativity is based are  due to Lorentz, but Einstein connected them with his general principle,  namely, that there must be nothing, in observable phenomena, which  could be attributed to absolute motion of the observer.    In orthodox Newtonian dynamics the principle of relativity had a  simpler form, which did not require the substitution of local time  for general time. But it now appeared that Newtonian dynamics is only  valid when we confine ourselves to velocities much less than that  of light. The whole Galileo-Newton system thus sank to the level  of a first approximation, becoming progressively less exact as the  velocities concerned approached that of light.    Einstein's extension of his principle so as to account for gravitation  was made during the war, and for a considerable period our astronomers  were unable to become acquainted with it, owing to the difficulty  of obtaining German printed matter. However, copies of his work  ultimately reached the outside world and enabled people to learn more  about it. Gravitation, ever since Newton, had remained isolated from  other forces in nature; various attempts had been made to account  for it, but without success. The immense unification effected by  electro-magnetism apparently left gravitation out of its scope. It  seemed that nature had presented a challenge to the physicists which  none of them were able to meet.    At this point Einstein intervened with a hypothesis which, apart  altogether from subsequent verification, deserves to rank as one  of the great monuments of human genius. After correcting Newton,  it remained to correct Euclid, and it was in terms of non-Euclidean  geometry that he stated his new theory. Non-Euclidean geometry is  a study of which the primary motive was logical and philosophical;  few of its promoters ever dreamed that it would come to be applied  in physics. Some of Euclid's axioms were felt to be not \"necessary  truths,\" but mere empirical laws; in order to establish this view,  self-consistent geometries were constructed upon assumptions other  than those of Euclid. In these geometries the sum of the angles of  a triangle is not two right angles, and the departure from two right  angles increases as the size of the triangle increases. It is often  said that in non-Euclidean geometry space has a curvature, but this  way of stating the matter is misleading, since it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11340"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration: Epsom New Race Stand.]      We do not wish to compete with the \"List of all the running horse-es,  with the names, weights, and colours of the riders,\" although the  proximity of our publication day to the commencement of Epsom Races  (June 2), has induced us to select the above subject for an  illustration.    The erection of the New Race Stand is the work of a company, entitled  the \"Epsom Grand Stand Association\"--the capital L20,000, in 1,000  shares of L20 each. The speculation is patronized by the Stewards of  the Jockey Club, and among the trustees is one of the county members,  C.N. Pallmer, Esq. The building is now roofed in, and temporary  accommodation will be provided for visitors at the ensuing Spring  Races. It is after the model of the Stand at Doncaster, but is much  larger, and will accommodate from 4 to 5,000 persons. The style of the  architecture is Grecian.    The building is 156 feet in width, including the Terrace, and 60 feet  in depth, having a portico the width, returning on each side, which is  connected with a spacious terrace, raised ten feet above the level of  the ground, and a magnificent flight of steps in the centre. The  columns of the portico are of the Doric order, supporting a balcony,  or gallery, which is to be covered by a verandah, erected on small  ornamental iron pillars, placed over those below. The upper part of  the Stand is to have a balustrade the whole width of the front. With  reference to the interior arrangements, there are four large and  well-proportioned rooms for refreshments, &c.; a spacious hall,  leading through a screen of Doric columns to a large and elegant  staircase of stone, and on each side of the staircase are retiring  rooms of convenience for gentlemen. The entrance to this floor is from  the abovementioned terrace and portico in front; and also, at the  back, by an entrance which forms a direct communication through the  building. The first floor consists of a splendid room, 108 feet in  length, and 34 in width, divided into three compartments by ornamental  columns and pilasters, supporting a richly paneled ceiling, and having  a direct communication with the balcony, or gallery; and on each side  of the staircase there are retiring rooms for the ladies, with the  same arrangements as those below for the gentlemen. The roof will  contain about 2,000 persons standing; affording, at the same time, an  opportunity for every one to see the whole of the race (Derby Course)  which at one time was considered doubtful.    The architect is Mr. W. Trendall; and the builder Mr. Chadwick.    By a neat plan from a survey by Mr. Mogg, the \"Stand\" is about ten  poles from the Winning Post. It must have a most commanding view of  the surrounding country--but, anon, \"may we be there to see.\"           *       *       *       *       *      HISTORY OF COALS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      Coals are found in several parts of the continent of Europe, but the  principal mines are in this country. They have been discovered and  wrought in Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Canada, and in some of the  provinces of New England. China abounds in them, and they are well  known in Tartary, and in the Island of Madagascar.    We find (says Brand) express mention of coals, used as a fuel by  artificers about 2,000 years ago, in the writings of Theophrastus, the  scholar of Aristotle, who, in his book on Stones, gives the substance;  though some writers have not scrupled to affirm, that coal was unknown  to the Ancient Britons, yet others have adduced proofs to the  contrary, which seem, to carry along with them little less than  conviction. The first charter for the license of digging coals, was  granted by King Henry III. in the year 1239; it was there denominated  sea coal; and, in 1281, Newcastle was famous for its great trade in  this article; but in 1306, the use of sea coal was prohibited at  London, by proclamation. Brewers, dyers, and other artificers, who had  occasion for great fires, had found their account in substituting our  fossil for dry wood and charcoal; but so general was the prejudice  against it at that time, that the nobles and commons assembled in  parliament, complained against the use thereof as a public nuisance,  which was thought to corrupt the air with its smoke and stink. Shortly  after this, it was the common fuel at the King's palace in London;  and, in 1325, a trade was opened between France and England, in which  corn was imported, and coal exported. Stowe in his \"Annals\" says,  \"within thirty years last the nice dames of London would not come into  any house or roome where sea coales were burned; nor willingly eat of  the meat that was either sod or roasted with sea coal fire.\"    Tinmouth Priory had a colliery at Elwick, which in 1330 was let at the  yearly rent of five pounds; in 1530 it was let for twenty pounds a  year, on condition that not more than twenty chaldron should be drawn  in a day; and eight years after, at fifty pounds a year, without  restriction on the quantity to be wrought. In Richard the Second's  time, Newcastle coals were sold at Whitby, at three shillings and  four-pence per chaldron; and in the time of Henry VIII. their price  was twelvepence a chaldron in Newcastle; in London about four  shillings, and in France they sold for thirteen nobles per chaldron.  Queen Elizabeth obtained a lease of the manors and coal mines of  Gateshead and Whickham, which she soon transferred to the Earl of  Leicester. He assigned it to his secretary, Sutton, the founder of the  Charter-house, who also made assignment of it to Sir W. Riddell and  others, for the use of the Mayor and Burgesses of Newcastle. Duties  were laid upon this article to assist in building St. Paul's Church,  and fifty parish churches in London after the great fire; and in 1677,  Charles II. granted to his natural son, Charles Lenox, Duke of  Richmond, and his heirs, a duty of one shilling a chaldron on coals,  which continued in his family till it was purchased by government in  1800. The collieries in the vicinity of Newcastle are perhaps the most  valuable and extensive in Europe, and afford nearly the whole supply  of the metropolis, and of those counties on the eastern coast  deficient in coal strata; thus--              \"The grim ore    Here useless, like the miser's brighter hoard,    Is from its prison brought and sent abroad,    The frozen horns to cheer, to minister    To needful sustenance and polished arts--    Hence are the hungry fed, the naked clothed,    The wintry damps dispell'd, and social mirth    Exults and glows before the blazing hearth.\"    _Iago's Edge Hill_, p. 106.

Two of your correspondents have puzzled themselves in seeking the  origin of the old Cat and Fiddle sign. The one has been led away by a  love of etymology--the other would string the fiddle at the expense of  poor puss's viscera. Now laying aside conjecture and the subtleties of  language, suppose we consult plain matter of fact? It is then  generally allowed that the tones of a flute resemble the _human  voice_: those of a clarionet, the notes of a _goose_: and, all the  world knows that a well-played violin (especially in the practice of  gliding) yields sounds so inseparable from the _strains of a cat_, as  not to be distinguished by the mere amateur of musical science.    In conformity, therefore, with this last truth, the small fiddles  which Dancing-masters carry in their pockets, are at this day called  _kits_. But our etymologist will readily perceive this to be a mere  abbreviation, and that they must originally have been known as  _kittens_.    E.D.

(_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)        \"I am corrected, sir; but hear me speak--    When admiration glows with such a fire    As to o'ertop the memory, error then    May merit mercy.\" _Old Play_.    In justice to myself and the readers of the MIRROR, I must be allowed  to offer a few apologetic remarks on the almost unpardonable  anachronisms which I so inadvertently suffered to occur in my  communication on the subject of Dr. Johnson's Residence in Bolt Court.  But when I state that the chronological metathesis occurred entirely  in consequence of my referring to that most treacherous portion of  human intellect, the memory; and that it is upwards of seven years  since I read \"Boswell's Life of Johnson,\" or \"Johnson's Poets,\" it may  be some mitigation of the censure I so justly deserve. Yet I may be  suffered to suggest to your correspondent, who has so kindly corrected  me, that my paper was more in the suppository style than he seems to  have imagined; and that I did not assert that Boswell, Savage, and  Johnson, met at the latter's \"house in Bolt Court, and discussed  subjects of polite literature.\" The expression used is, \"We can  _imagine_,\" &c. constituting a creation of the fancy rather than a  positive portraiture. Certain it is that Johnson's dwelling was in the  neighbourhood of Temple Bar at the time of the nocturnal perambulation  alluded to; and that it was Savage (to whom he was so unaccountably  attached, in spite of the \"bastard's\" frailties) who enticed the  doctor from his bed to a midnight ramble.
