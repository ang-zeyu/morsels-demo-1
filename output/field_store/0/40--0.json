The Wild Geese          THE UNTAMED          CHAPTER I      PAN OF THE DESERT    Even to a high-flying bird this was a country to be passed over  quickly. It was burned and brown, littered with fragments of rock,  whether vast or small, as if the refuse were tossed here after the  making of the world. A passing shower drenched the bald knobs of a  range of granite hills and the slant morning sun set the wet rocks  aflame with light. In a short time the hills lost their halo and  resumed their brown. The moisture evaporated. The sun rose higher and  looked sternly across the desert as if he searched for any remaining  life which still struggled for existence under his burning course.    And he found life. Hardy cattle moved singly or in small groups and  browsed on the withered bunch grass. Summer scorched them, winter  humped their backs with cold and arched up their bellies with famine,  but they were a breed schooled through generations for this fight  against nature. In this junk-shop of the world, rattlesnakes were  rulers of the soil. Overhead the buzzards, ominous black specks  pendant against the white-hot sky, ruled the air.    It seemed impossible that human beings could live in this  rock-wilderness. If so, they must be to other men what the lean, hardy  cattle of the hills are to the corn-fed stabled beeves of the States.    Over the shoulder of a hill came a whistling which might have been  attributed to the wind, had not this day been deathly calm. It was fit  music for such a scene, for it seemed neither of heaven nor earth,  but the soul of the great god Pan come back to earth to charm those  nameless rocks with his wild, sweet piping. It changed to harmonious  phrases loosely connected. Such might be the exultant improvisations  of a master violinist.    A great wolf, or a dog as tall and rough coated as a wolf, trotted  around the hillside. He paused with one foot lifted and lolling,  crimson tongue, as he scanned the distance and then turned to look  back in the direction from which he had come. The weird music changed  to whistled notes as liquid as a flute. The sound drew closer. A  horseman rode out on the shoulder and checked his mount. One could not  choose him at first glance as a type of those who fight nature in a  region where the thermometer moves through a scale of a hundred and  sixty degrees in the year to an accompaniment of cold-stabbing winds  and sweltering suns. A thin, handsome face with large brown eyes and  black hair, a body tall but rather slenderly made--he might have been  a descendant of some ancient family of Norman nobility; but could such  proud gentry be found riding the desert in a tall-crowned sombrero  with chaps on his legs and a red bandana handkerchief knotted around  his throat? That first glance made the rider seem strangely out of  place in such surroundings. One might even smile at the contrast, but  at the second glance the smile would fade, and at the third, it would  be replaced with a stare of interest. It was impossible to tell why  one respected this man, but after a time there grew a suspicion of  unknown strength in this lone rider, strength like that of a machine  which is stopped but only needs a spark of fire to plunge it into  irresistible action. Strangely enough, the youthful figure seemed in  tune with that region of mighty distances, with that white, cruel sun,  with that bird of prey hovering high, high in the air.    It required some study to guess at these qualities of the rider, for  they were such things as a child feels more readily than a grown man;  but it needed no expert to admire the horse he bestrode. It was a  statue in black marble, a steed fit for a Shah of Persia! The stallion  stood barely fifteen hands, but to see him was to forget his size. His  flanks shimmered like satin in the sun. What promise of power in the  smooth, broad hips! Only an Arab poet could run his hand over that  shoulder and then speak properly of the matchless curve. Only an Arab  could appreciate legs like thin and carefully drawn steel below the  knees; or that flow of tail and windy mane; that generous breast with  promise of the mighty heart within; that arched neck; that proud head  with the pricking ears, wide forehead, and muzzle, as the Sheik said,  which might drink from a pint-pot.    A rustling like dried leaves came from among the rocks and the hair  rose bristling around the neck of the wolflike dog. With outstretched  head he approached the rocks, sniffing, then stopped and turned  shining eyes upon his master, who nodded and swung from the saddle. It  was a little uncanny, this silent interchange of glances between the  beast and the man. The cause of the dog's anxiety was a long rattler  which now slid out from beneath a boulder, and giving its harsh  warning, coiled, ready to strike. The dog backed away, but instead of  growling he looked to the man.    Cowboys frequently practise with their revolvers at snakes, but one of  the peculiarities of this rider was that he carried no gun, neither  six-shooter nor rifle. He drew out a short knife which might be used  to skin a beef or carve meat, though certainly no human being had ever  used such a weapon against a five-foot rattler. He stooped and rested  both hands on his thighs. His feet were not two paces from the poised  head of the snake. As if marvelling at this temerity, the big rattler  tucked back his head and sounded the alarm again. In response the  cowboy flashed his knife in the sun. Instantly the snake struck but  the deadly fangs fell a few inches short of the riding boots. At the  same second the man moved. No eye could follow the leap of his hand as  it darted down and fastened around the snake just behind the head. The  long brown body writhed about his wrist, with rattles clashing. He  severed the head deftly and tossed the twisting mass back on the  rocks.    Then, as if he had performed the most ordinary act, he rubbed his  gloves in the sand, cleansed his knife in a similar manner, and  stepped back to his horse. Contrary to the rules of horse-nature, the  stallion had not flinched at sight of the snake, but actually advanced  a high-headed pace or two with his short ears laid flat on his  neck, and a sudden red fury in his eyes. He seemed to watch for an  opportunity to help his master. As the man approached after killing  the snake the stallion let his ears go forward again and touched his  nose against his master's shoulder. When the latter swung into the  saddle, the wolf-dog came to his side, reared, and resting his  forefeet on the stirrup stared up into the rider's face. The man  nodded to him, whereat, as if he understood a spoken word, the dog  dropped back and trotted ahead. The rider touched the reins and  galloped down the easy slope. The little episode had given the effect  of a three-cornered conversation. Yet the man had been as silent as  the animals.    In a moment he was lost among the hills, but still his whistling came  back, fainter and fainter, until it was merely a thrilling whisper  that dwelt in the air but came from no certain direction.    His course lay towards a road which looped whitely across the hills.  The road twisted over a low ridge where a house stood among a grove of  cottonwoods dense enough and tall enough to break the main force of  any wind. On the same road, a thousand yards closer to the rider of  the black stallion, was Morgan's place.          CHAPTER II      THE PANTHER    In the ranch house old Joseph Cumberland frowned on the floor as he  heard his daughter say: \"It isn't right, Dad. I never noticed it  before I went away to school, but since I've come back I begin to feel  that it's shameful to treat Dan in this way.\"    Her eyes brightened and she shook her golden head for emphasis. Her  father watched her with a faintly quizzical smile and made no reply.  The dignity of ownership of many thousand cattle kept the old  rancher's shoulders square, and there was an antique gentility about  his thin face with its white goatee. He was more like a quaint  figure of the seventeenth century than a successful cattleman of the  twentieth.    \"It _is_ shameful, Dad,\" she went on, encouraged by his silence, \"or  you could tell me some reason.\"    \"Some reason for not letting him have a gun?\" asked the rancher, still  with the quizzical smile.    \"Yes, yes!\" she said eagerly, \"and some reason for treating him in a  thousand ways as if he were an irresponsible boy.\"    \"Why, Kate, gal, you have tears in your eyes!\"    He drew her onto a stool beside him, holding both her hands, and  searched her face with eyes as blue and almost as bright as her own.  \"How does it come that you're so interested in Dan?\"    \"Why, Dad, dear,\" and she avoided his gaze, \"I've always been  interested in him. Haven't we grown up together?\"    \"Part ways you have.\"    \"And haven't we been always just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#1)"],[1,"Team                              DIO'S ROME                          AN               HISTORICAL NARRATIVE           ORIGINALLY COMPOSED IN GREEK               DURING THE REIGNS OF              SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS, GETA              AND CARACALLA, MACRINUS,         ELAGABALUS AND ALEXANDER SEVERUS:                       AND          NOW PRESENTED IN ENGLISH FORM                        BY              HERBERT BALDWIN FOSTER,       A.B.

[Sidenote: A.D. 54 (a.u. 807)] [Sidenote:--1--] At the death of Claudius  the leadership on most just principles belonged to Britannicus, who had  been born a legitimate son of Claudius and in physical development was  beyond what would have been expected of his years. Yet by law the power  passed to Nero on account of his adoption. No claim, indeed, is stronger  than that of arms. Every one who possesses superior force has always the  appearance of both saying and doing what is more just. So Nero, having  first disposed of Claudius's will and having succeeded him as master of  the whole empire, put Britannicus and his sisters out of the way. Why,  then, should one stop to lament the misfortunes of other victims?    [Sidenote:--2--] The following signs of dominion had been observed in his  career. At his birth just before dawn rays not cast by any beam of  sunlight yet visible surrounded his form. And a certain astrologer from  this and from the motion of the stars at that time and their relation to  one another divined two things in regard to him,--that he would rule and  that he would murder his mother. Agrippina on hearing this became for the  moment so beside herself as actually to cry out: \"Let him kill me, if only  he shall rule.\" Later she was destined to repent bitterly of her prayer.  Some people become so steeped in folly that if they expect to obtain some  blessing mingled with evil, they at once through their anxiety for the  advantage pay no heed to the detriment. When the time for the latter also  comes, they are cast down and would choose not to have secured even the  greatest good thing. Yet Domitius, the father of Nero, had a sufficient  previous intimation of his son's coming baseness and licentiousness, not  by any oracle but through the nature of his own and Agrippina's  characters. And he declared: \"It is impossible for any good man to be born  from me and from her.\" As time went on, the finding of a serpent skin  around Nero's neck when he was but a boy caused the seers to say: \"He  shall acquire great power from the aged man.\" Serpents are thought to  slough off their old age with their old skin, and so get power.    [Sidenote:--3--] Nero was seventeen years of age when he began to rule. He  first entered the camp, and, after reading to the soldiers all that Seneca  had written, he promised them as much as Claudius had been accustomed to  give. Before the senate he read such a considerable document,--this, too,  written by Seneca,--that it was voted the statements should be inscribed  on a silver tablet and should be read every time the new consuls took up  the duties of their office. Consequently those who heard him made  themselves ready to enjoy a good reign according to the letter of the  compilation. At first Agrippina [in company with Pallas, a vulgar and  tiresome man,] managed all affairs pertaining to the empire, and she and  her son went about together, often reclining in the same litter; usually,  however, she would be carried and he would follow alongside. It was she  who transacted business with embassies and sent letters to peoples and  governors and kings. When this had gone on for a considerable time, it  aroused the displeasure of Seneca and Burrus, who were both the most  sensible and the most influential of the advisers of Nero. The one was his  teacher and the other was prefect of the Pretorians. They took the  following occasion to stop this method of procedure. An embassy of  Armenians had arrived and Agrippina wished to ascend the platform from  which Nero was talking with them. The two men, seeing her approach,  persuaded the young man to go down before she could reach there and meet  his mother, pretending some form of greeting. After that was done they did  not return again, making some excuse to prevent the foreigners from seeing  the flaw in the empire. Subsequently they labored to keep any public  business from being again committed to her hands.    [Sidenote:--4--] When they had accomplished this, they themselves took  charge of the entire empire and gave it the very best and fairest  management that they could. Nero was not in general fond of affairs and  was glad to live at leisure. [The reason, indeed, that he had previously  distrusted his mother and now was fond of her lay in the fact that now he  was free to enjoy himself, and the government was being carried on no less  well. And his advisers after consultation made many changes in existing  customs, abolishing some things altogether and passing a number of new  laws.] They let Nero sow his wild oats with the intention of bringing  about in him through the satisfaction of all his desires a changed  attitude of mind, while in the meantime no great damage should be done to  public interests. Surely they must have known that a young and self-willed  spirit, when reared in unreproved license and in absolute authority, so  far from becoming satiated by the indulgence of its passions is ruined  more and more by these very agencies. Indeed, Nero at first gave but  simple dinners; his revels, his drunkenness, his amours were moderate.  Afterward, as no one reproved him for them and public business was carried  forward none the worse for all of it, he began to believe that what he did  was right and that he could carry his practices to even greater lengths.  [Consequently he began to indulge in each of these pursuits in a more open  and precipitate fashion. And in case his guardians gave him any warning or  his mother any rebuke, he would appear abashed while they were present and  promise to reform; but as soon as they were gone, he would again become  the slave of his desire and yield to those who were dragging him in the  other direction,--a straight course down hill.] Next he came to despise  instruction, inasmuch as he was always hearing from his associates, \"Do  _you_ submit to this?\" or \"Do _you_ fear these people?\", \"Don't  you know that you are Caesar?\", \"Have not you the authority over them  rather than they over you?\" He was also animated by obstinacy, not wishing  to acknowledge his mother as superior and himself as inferior, nor to  admit the greater good sense of Seneca and Burrus.    [Sidenote:--5--] Finally he passed the possibility of being shamed, dashed  to the ground and trampled under foot all their suggestions, and began to  follow in the steps of Gaius. When he had once felt a desire to emulate  him, he quite outdid him, for he believed that the imperial power must  manifest itself among other ways by allowing no one to surpass it even in  the vilest deeds. [As he was praised for this by the crowds, and received  many pleasant compliments from them, he gave himself no rest. His doings  were at first confined to his home and associates, but were later on  carried abroad. Thus he attached a mighty disgrace to the whole Roman race  and committed many outrages upon the individuals composing it. Innumerable  acts of violence and insult, of rape and murder, were committed both by  the emperor himself and by those who at one time or another had influence  with him. And, as certainly and inevitably follows in all such practices],  great sums of money naturally were spent, great sums unjustly procured,  and great sums seized by force. For under no circumstances was Nero  niggardly. Here is an illustration. He had ordered no less than two  hundred and fifty myriads at one time to be given to Doryphorus, who  attended to the state documents of his empire. Agrippina had it all piled  in a heap, hoping by showing him the money all"]]]
