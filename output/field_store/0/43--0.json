INDIAN SPEECHES    (1907-1909)    BY VISCOUNT MORLEY    OM      _The modern and Western spirit is assuredly at work in the Indian  countries, but the vital question for Indian Governments is, How far  it has changed the ideas of men_?--SIR HENRY MAINE.    1909          NOTE    A signal transaction is now taking place in the course of Indian  polity. These speeches, with no rhetorical pretensions, contain some  of the just, prudent, and necessary points and considerations, that  have guided this transaction, and helped to secure for it the sanction  of Parliament. The too limited public that follows Indian affairs with  coherent attention, may find this small sheaf of speeches, revised as  they have been, to be of passing use. Three cardinal State-papers have  been appended. They mark the spirit of British rule in India, at three  successive stages, for three generations past; and bear directly upon  what is now being done.    _November_, 1909.          CONTENTS    I.

JUNE 6, 1907)    I am afraid I shall have to ask the House for rather a large draft  upon its indulgence. The Indian Secretary is like the aloe, that  blooms once in 100 years: he only troubles the House with speeches  of his own once in twelve months. There are several topics which the  House will expect me to say something about, and of these are two or  three topics of supreme interest and importance, for which I plead for  patience and comprehensive consideration. We are too apt to find that  Gentlemen both here and outside fix upon some incident of which they  read in the newspaper; they put it under a microscope; they indulge  in reflections upon it; and they regard that as taking an intelligent  interest in the affairs of India. If we could suppose that on some  occasion within the last three or four weeks a wrong turn had been  taken in judgment at Simla, or in the Cabinet, or in the India Office,  or that to-day in this House some wrong turn might be taken, what  disasters would follow, what titanic efforts to repair these  disasters, what devouring waste of national and Indian treasure, and  what a wreckage might follow! These are possible consequences that  misjudgment either here or in India might bring with it.    Sir, I believe I am not going too far when I say that this is almost,  if not quite, the first occasion upon which what is called the British  democracy in its full strength has been brought directly face to face  with the difficulties of Indian Government in all their intricacies,  all their complexities, all their subtleties, and above all in their  enormous magnitude. Last year when I had the honour of addressing the  House on the Indian Budget, I observed, as many have done before me,  that it is one of the most difficult experiments ever tried in human  history, whether you can carry on, what you will have to try to carry  on in India--personal government along with free speech and free right  of public meeting. This which last year was partially a speculative  question, has this year become more or less actual, and that is a  question which I shall by and by have to submit to the House. I want  to set out the case as frankly as I possibly can. I want, if I may  say so without presumption, to take the House into full confidence so  far--and let nobody quarrel with this provision--as public interests  allow. I will beg the House to remember that we do not only hear one  another; we are ourselves this afternoon overheard. Words that may be  spoken here, are overheard in the whole kingdom. They are overheard  thousands of miles away by a vast and complex community. They are  overheard by others who are doing the service and work of the Crown in  India. By those, too, who take part in the immense work of commercial  and non-official life in India. We are overheard by great Indian  princes who are outside British India. We are overheard by the dim  masses of Indians whom, in spite of all, we shall persist in regarding  as our friends. We are overheard by those whom, I am afraid, we must  reluctantly call our enemies. This is the reason why everybody who  speaks to-day, certainly including myself, must use language that is  well advised, language of reserve, and, as I say again, the fruit of  comprehensive consideration.    The Budget is a prosperity Budget. We have, however, to admit that  a black shadow falls across the prospect. The plague figures are  appalling. But do not let us get unreasonably dismayed, even about  these appalling figures. If we reviewed the plague figures up to last  December, we might have hoped that the horrible scourge was on the  wane. From 92,000 deaths in the year 1900, the figures went up to  1,100,000 in 1904, while in 1905 they exceeded 1,000,000. In 1906  a gleam of hope arose, and the mortality sank to something under  350,000. The combined efforts of Government and people had produced  that reduction; but, alas, since January, 1907, plague has again  flared up in districts that have been filled with its terror for a  decade; and for the first four months of this year the deaths amounted  to 642,000, which exceeded the record for the same period in any past  year. You must remember that we have to cover a very vast area. I do  not know that these figures would startle us if we took the area of  the whole of Europe. It was in 1896 that this plague first appeared in  India, and up to April, 1907, the total figure of the human beings who  have died is 5,250,000. But dealing with a population of 300,000,000,  this dire mortality, although enormous, is not at all comparable with  the results of the black death and other scourges, that spread over  Europe in earlier times, in proportion to the population. The plague  mortality in 1904 (the worst complete year) would only represent,  if evenly distributed, a death-rate of about 3 per 1,000. But it is  local, and particularly centres in the Punjab, the United Provinces,  and in Bombay. I do not think that anybody who has been concerned in  India--I do not care to what school of Indian thought he belongs--can  deny that measures for the extermination and mitigation of this  disease have occupied the most serious, constant, unflagging, zealous,  and energetic attention of the Indian Government. But the difficulties  we encounter are manifold, as many Members of the House are well  aware. It is possible that hon. Members may rise and say that we are  not enforcing with sufficient zeal proper sanitary rules; and, on the  other hand, I dare say that other hon. Members will get up to show  that the great difficulty in the way of sanitary rules being observed,  arises from the reluctance of the population to practise them. That  is perfectly natural and is well understood. They are a suspicious  population, and we all know that, when these new rules are forced  upon them, they constantly resent and resist them. A policy of severe  repression is worse than useless. I will not detain the House with  particulars of all the proceedings we have taken in dealing with  the plague. But I may say that we have instituted a long scientific  inquiry with the aid of the Royal Society and the Lister Institute.  Then we have very intelligent officers, who have done all they could  to trace the roots of the disease, and to discover if they could, any  means to prevent it. It is a curious thing that, while there appears  to be no immunity from this frightful scourge for the natives,  Europeans enjoy almost entire immunity from the disease. That is  difficult to understand or to explain.    Now as to opium, I know that a large number of Members in the House  are interested in it. Judging by the voluminous correspondence that I  receive, all the Churches and both political Parties are sincerely and  deeply interested in the question, and I was going to say that the  resolutions with which they have favoured me often use the expression  \"righteousness before revenue.\" The motto is excellent, but its virtue  will be cheap and shabby, if you only satisfy your own righteousness  at the expense of other people's revenue.    Mr. LUPTON: We are quite ready to bear the expense.    Mr. MORLEY: My hon. friend says they are quite prepared to bear the  expense. I commend that observation cheerfully to the Chancellor of  the Exchequer. This question touches the consciences of the people of  the country. My hon. friend sometimes goes a little far; still, he  represents a considerable body of feeling. Last May, when the opium  question was raised in this House, something fell from me which  reached the Chinese Government, and the Chinese Government, on the  strength of that utterance of mine, made in the name of His Majesty's  Government, have persistently done their best to come to some sort  of arrangement and understanding with His Majesty's Government. In  September an Imperial decree was issued in China ordering the strict  prohibition of the consumption and cultivation of opium, with a view  to ultimate eradication in ten years. Communications were made to  the Foreign Secretary, and since then there has been a considerable  correspondence, some of which the House is, by Question and Answer,  acquainted with. The Chinese Government have been uniformly assured,  not only by my words spoken in May, but by the Foreign Secretary, that  the sympathy of this country was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#1)"],[1,"Team.            [Illustration]      THE INFANT SYSTEM,    FOR    DEVELOPING THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL POWERS OF ALL CHILDREN,    FROM ONE TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE    BY SAMUEL WILDERSPIN, INVENTOR OF THE SYSTEM OF INFANT TRAINING.      \"Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me.\"  _Matt_. xviii. 5.    \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones.\" _Matt_.  xvii. 10.    EIGHTH EDITION, CAREFULLY REVISED.      1852.        PREFACE      In again presenting this volume to the world, I trust I feel thankful  to God for the favour with which the Infant System has been received,  and for all the aid I have enjoyed in my course of labour. Had the  measures I originated for the development of the infant mind, and the  improvement of the moral character, been sanctioned at first, as many  now think they should have been, their progress would, undoubtedly,  have been far greater; but when I consider what has been accomplished  under the divine benediction, and amid greater difficulties than ever  beset the path of an individual similarly occupied, I know not how to  express the gratitude of which I am conscious. It seems proper and  even necessary to remark, that the system explained in this volume, is  the result of many years of labour. Thousands of children have been  attentively observed, and for the necessities that arose in their  instruction, provision has been made. Others have doubtless reached  some of the conclusions at which I have arrived, but this is only  another instance of the coincidence in judgment and effort, often  discoverable in persons far apart, whose attention has been directed  to similiar subjects; but with the exception of the elliptical plan,  devised by Dr. Gilchrist, I am not aware that I owe an idea or  contrivance to any individual whatever. Upwards of twenty-five  thousand children have been now under my own care, in various parts of  the United Kingdom, whose age has not exceeded six years; myself, my  daughters, and my agents, have organized many score of schools, and  thus I have had opportunities of studying the infant mind and heart,  such as none of my contemporaries have ever possessed.    Still I am aware I have much to learn. I am far less satisfied with  the extent of my knowledge, and far less confident of its perfection  and completeness now than I was in the earlier part of my course.  The whole energies of my mind, however, having been thrown upon the  subject, and the whole of my time for the third of a century having  been zealously devoted to it, I trust the volume will contain  knowledge of a more plain, simple, and practical character than is  elsewhere to be found:--perhaps it may not be presumption to say than  _can_ elsewhere be found. Should I have the pleasure to labour for  years to come, I trust I shall have much more to communicate on the  subject.    Two editions of this work in its former state have been printed in  German; and it has also been reprinted in America. I have, however,  felt it due to the friends of education, to make this volume as  complete as possible, and though still occasionally engaged in  superintending and organizing schools, I have felt it necessary to  revise this eighth edition very carefully throughout, and commence it  with a new and additional chapter.    _Moor Cottage,  Westgate Common,  Wakefield,  Nov. 1552_.          A FEW TESTIMONIALS TO THE INFANT SYSTEM.      It is said that we are aiming at carrying education too far; that we  are drawing it out to an extravagant length, and that, not satisfied  with dispensing education to children also have attained what in  former times was thought a proper age, we are now anxious to educate  mere infants, incapable of receiving benefit from such instruction.  This objection may be answered in two ways. In the first place, it  should be observed, that the objection comes from those very persons  who object to education being given to children when they arrive at a  more advanced period, on the ground that their parents then begin to  find them useful in labour, and consequently cannot spare so much of  their time as might be requisite: surely, that, the education of the  children should commence at that time when their labour can be of  value to their parents. But the other answer, in my opinion, is still  more decisive: it is found even at the early age of seven or eight,  that children are not void of those propensities, which are the  forerunners of vice, and I can give no better illustration of this,  than the fact of a child only eight years old, being convicted of a  capital offence at our tribunals of justice; when, therefore, I find  that at this early period of life, these habits of vice are formed, it  seems to me that we ought to begin still earlier to store their minds  with such tastes, and to instruct them in such a manner as to exclude  the admission of those practises that lead to such early crime and  depravity. A Noble friend has most justly stated, that it is not with  the experiences of yesterday that we come armed to the contest: it is  not a speculation that we are bringing forward to your notice, but an  experiment.'--_The Lord Chancellor_.    \"In leaving poor children to the care of their parents, neglect is the  least that happens; it too frequently occurs that they are turned over  to delegates, where they meet with the worst treatment; so that we do  not in fact come so much into contact with the parents themselves as  with those delegates, who are so utterly unfit for the office they  undertake. Infant Schools, however, have completely succeeded, not  only in the negative plan they had in view, of keeping the children  out of vice and mischief, but even to the extent of engrafting  in their minds at an early age those principles of virtue, which  capacitated them for receiving a further stage of instruction at a  more advanced school, and finally, as they approached manhood, to be  ripened into the noblest sentiments of probity and integrity.\"--_The  Marquis of Lansdowne_.    \"I am a zealous friend, upon conviction, to Infant Schools for the  children of the poor. No person who has not himself watched them, can  form an adequate action of what these institutions, when judiciously  conducted, may effect in forming the tempers and habits of young  children; in giving them, not so much actual knowledge, as that which  at their age is more important, the habit and faculty of acquiring it;  and it correcting those moral defects which neglect or injudicious  treatment would soon confirm and render incurable. The early age at  which children are taken out of our National Schools, is an additional  reason for commencing a regular and systematic discipline of their  minds and wills, as soon as they are capable of profiting by it; and  that is at the very earliest opening of the understanding, and at the  first manifestation of a corrupt nature in the shape of a childish  petulance and waywardness.\"--_The Bishop of London_.    \"The claims of this Institution were of such a nature, that they  required no recommendation but a full statement of them. The  foundation of its happy results had been pointed out to exist in the  principles of policy, and of religion paramount to all policy--a  religion that appealed to every feeling of human nature. He would  recommend this charity, as one less attended with perplexity in its  operations or doubt as to its utility, than many, which, though  established with the best possible motives, frequently failed in  effecting the good proposed; but in this the most acute opponent could  not discover any mischief that would arise from its success.\"--_Sir  James Mackintosh_.    \"I have always thought that that man that would be the greatest  benefactor to his country who did most for the suppression of crime;  this I am sorry to say, our legislature have neglected in a great  degree, while they have readily employed themselves in providing for  its punishment. Those acquainted with our prisons must know that those  found to have sunk deepest into vice and crime were persons who had  never received any education, moral or religious. In the Refuge for  the Destitute, an exact account was kept, and it was found that of the  great mass of culprits sent there by the magistrates on account of  their youth, two-thirds were the children of parents who had no  opportunity of educating them. By this institution they would at once  promote virtue and prevent vice.\"--_Dr. Lushington_.    \"The real fact is, that the character of all mankind is formed very  early--much earlier than might be supposed: at the age of two or three  years, dispositions were found in children of a description the most  objectionable. In these schools the principles of mutual kindness and  assistance were carried as far as could well be conceived, and it was  most delightful to regard the conduct of the children towards each  other. Instead of opposition, they displayed mutual good-will,  inculcated to the greatest degree, so as to destroy in the minds of  the children that selfishness which was the bane of our nature. Such  effects appeared almost to realize the golden age, for the children  appeared always happy, and never so happy as when attending the  schools.\"--_W. Smith, Esq. M.P_.    \"I feel, having witnessed the happy effects produced by these schools,  a warm zeal in support of such institutions. We cannot begin too soon  to impress religions principles on the minds of the young; it is an  affecting consideration, that while great statesmen have been busied  in their closets on some fine scheme or speculation, they have  neglected these salutary principles which the Almighty has given to  mankind. It is remarkable how eagerly the young mind receives the  histories of the Bible, and how well they are fitted to work on their  dispositions; and when I consider the miserable state of the poor, I  cannot but feel that the "]]]
