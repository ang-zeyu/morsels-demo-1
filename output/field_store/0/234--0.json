REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MODERN HISTORY IN THE  UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, IN ADMIRATION OF HIS PROFOUND HISTORICAL  LEARNING, AND IN GRATITUDE FOR ADVICE AND HELP GENEROUSLY GIVEN.              PREFACE      An apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a  new Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have  sought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of  facts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable  materials that have recently been published by continental historians.  To explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an  elaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space  absolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the  most important topics.    To deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief  importance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and  Vandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrueck, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,  and Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.  I have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or  collections of documents due to the labours of the \"Societe d'Histoire  Contemporaine,\" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,  Caudrillier, Capitaine \"J.G.,\" Levy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,  and others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,  Klinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the  recently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not  devoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with  caution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Leon Lecestre and  M. Leonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life  of the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely  revise our judgments on many of its episodes.    But I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not  been able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During  a study of this period for an earlier work published in the \"Cambridge  Historical Series,\" I ascertained the great value of the British  records for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our  historical research that, apart from the fruitful labours of the Navy  Records Society, of Messrs. Oscar Browning and Hereford George, and of  Mr. Bowman of Toronto, scarcely any English work has appeared that is  based on the official records of this period. Yet they are of great  interest and value. Our diplomatic agents then had the knack of  getting at State secrets in most foreign capitals, even when we were  at war with their Governments; and our War Office and Admiralty  Records have also yielded me some interesting \"finds.\" M. Levy, in the  preface to his \"Napoleon intime\" (1893), has well remarked that \"the  documentary history of the wars of the Empire has not yet been  written. To write it accurately, it will be more important thoroughly  to know foreign archives than those of France.\" Those of Russia,  Austria, and Prussia have now for the most part been examined; and I  think that I may claim to have searched all the important parts of our  Foreign Office Archives for the years in question, as well as for part  of the St. Helena period. I have striven to embody the results of this  search in the present volumes as far as was compatible with limits of  space and with the narrative form at which, in my judgment, history  ought always to aim.    On the whole, British policy comes out the better the more fully it is  known. Though often feeble and vacillating, it finally attained to  firmness and dignity; and Ministers closed the cycle of war with acts  of magnanimity towards the French people which are studiously ignored  by those who bid us shed tears over the martyrdom of St. Helena.  Nevertheless, the splendour of the finale must not blind us to the  flaccid eccentricities that made British statesmanship the laughing  stock of Europe in 1801-3, 1806-7, and 1809. Indeed, it is  questionable whether the renewal of war between England and Napoleon  in 1803 was due more to his innate forcefulness or to the contempt  which he felt for the Addington Cabinet. When one also remembers our  extraordinary blunders in the war of the Third Coalition, it seems a  miracle that the British Empire survived that life and death struggle  against a man of superhuman genius who was determined to effect its  overthrow. I have called special attention to the extent and  pertinacity of Napoleon's schemes for the foundation of a French  Colonial Empire in India, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia; and  there can be no doubt that the events of the years 1803-13 determined,  not only the destinies of Europe and Napoleon, but the general trend  of the world's colonization.    As it has been necessary to condense the story of Napoleon's life in  some parts, I have chosen to treat with special brevity the years  1809-11, which may be called the _constans aetas_ of his career, in  order to have more space for the decisive events that followed; but  even in these less eventful years I have striven to show how his  Continental System was setting at work mighty economic forces that  made for his overthrow, so that after the _debacle_ of 1812 it came to  be a struggle of Napoleon and France _contra mundum_.    While not neglecting the personal details of the great man's life, I  have dwelt mainly on his public career. Apart from his brilliant  conversations, his private life has few features of abiding interest,  perhaps because he early tired of the shallowness of Josephine and the  Corsican angularity of his brothers and sisters. But the cause also  lay in his own disposition. He once said to M. Gallois: \"Je n'aime pas  beaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin rien: _je suis tout a fait un  etre politique_.\" In dealing with him as a warrior and statesman, and  in sparing my readers details as to his bolting his food, sleeping at  concerts, and indulging in amours where for him there was no glamour  of romance, I am laying stress on what interested him most--in a word,  I am taking him at his best.    I could not have accomplished this task, even in the present  inadequate way, but for the help generously accorded from many  quarters. My heartfelt thanks are due to Lord Acton, Regius Professor  of Modern History in the University of Cambridge, for advice of the  highest importance; to Mr. Hubert Hall of the Public Record Office,  for guidance in my researches there; to Baron Lumbroso of Rome,  editor of the \"Bibliografia ragionata dell' Epoca Napoleonica,\" for  hints on Italian and other affairs; to Dr. Luckwaldt, Privat Docent of  the University of Bonn, and author of \"Oesterreich und die Anfaenge des  Befreiungs-Krieges,\" for his very scholarly revision of the chapters  on German affairs; to Mr. F.H.E. Cunliffe, M.A., Fellow of All Souls'  College, Oxford, for valuable advice on the campaigns of 1800, 1805,  and 1806; to Professor Caudrillier of Grenoble, author of \"Pichegru,\"  for information respecting the royalist plot; and to Messrs. J.E.  Morris, M.A., and E.L.S. Horsburgh, B.A., for detailed communications  concerning Waterloo, The nieces of the late Professor Westwood of  Oxford most kindly allowed the facsimile of the new Napoleon letter,  printed opposite p. 156 of vol. i., to be made from the original in  their possession; and Miss Lowe courteously placed at my disposal the  papers of her father relating to the years 1813-15, as well as to the  St. Helena period. I wish here to record my grateful obligations for  all these friendly courtesies, which have given value to the book,  besides saving me from many of the pitfalls with which the subject  abounds. That I have escaped them altogether is not to be imagined;  but I can honestly say, in the words of the late Bishop of London,  that \"I have tried to write true history.\"    J.H.R.

But the Commandments  do not always prevent such virtuous scoffers from dealings with their  neighbor of which no gentleman could be capable and retain his claim to  the title. Though it may require ingenuity to reconcile their actions with  the Decalogue--the ingenuity is always forthcoming. There is no intention  in this remark to intimate that there is any higher rule of life than the  Ten Commandments; only it is illuminating as showing the relationship  between manners and morals, which is too often overlooked. The polished  gentleman of sentimental fiction has so long served as the type of smooth  and conscienceless depravity that urbanity of demeanor inspires distrust  in ruder minds. On the other hand, the blunt, unpolished hero of melodrama  and romantic fiction has lifted brusqueness and pushfulness to a pedestal  not wholly merited. Consequently, the kinship between conduct that keeps  us within the law and conduct that makes civilized life worthy to be  called such, deserves to be noted with emphasis. The Chinese sage,  Confucius, could not tolerate the suggestion that virtue is in itself  enough without politeness, for he viewed them as inseparable and \"saw  courtesies as coming from the heart,\" maintaining that \"when they are  practised with all the heart, a moral elevation ensues.\"    People who ridicule etiquette as a mass of trivial and arbitrary  conventions, \"extremely troublesome to those who practise them and  insupportable to everybody else,\" seem to forget the long, slow progress  of social intercourse in the upward climb of man from the primeval state.  Conventions were established from the first to regulate the rights of the  individual and the tribe. They were and are the rules of the game of life  and must be followed if we would \"play the game.\" Ages before man felt the  need of indigestion remedies, he ate his food solitary and furtive in some  corner, hoping he would not be espied by any stronger and hungrier fellow.  It was a long, long time before the habit of eating in common was  acquired; and it is obvious that the practise could not have been taken up  with safety until the individuals of the race knew enough about one  another and about the food resources to be sure that there was food  sufficient for all. When eating in common became the vogue, table manners  made their appearance and they have been waging an uphill struggle ever  since. The custom of raising the hat when meeting an acquaintance derives  from the old rule that friendly knights in accosting each other should  raise the visor for mutual recognition in amity. In the knightly years, it  must be remembered, it was important to know whether one was meeting  friend or foe. Meeting a foe meant fighting on the spot. Thus, it is  evident that the conventions of courtesy not only tend to make the wheels  of life run more smoothly, but also act as safeguards in human  relationship. Imagine the Paris Peace Conference, or any of the later  conferences in Europe, without the protective armor of diplomatic  etiquette!    Nevertheless, to some the very word etiquette is an irritant. It implies a  great pother about trifles, these conscientious objectors assure us, and  trifles are unimportant. Trifles are unimportant, it is true, but then  life is made up of trifles. To those who dislike the word, it suggests all  that is finical and superfluous. It means a garish embroidery on the big  scheme of life; a clog on the forward march of a strong and courageous  nation. To such as these, the words etiquette and politeness connote  weakness and timidity. Their notion of a really polite man is a dancing  master or a man milliner. They were always willing to admit that the  French were the politest nation in Europe and equally ready to assert that  the French were the weakest and least valorous, until the war opened their  eyes in amazement. Yet, that manners and fighting can go hand in hand  appears in the following anecdote:    In the midst of the war, some French soldiers and some non-French of the  Allied forces were receiving their rations in a village back of the lines.  The non-French fighters belonged to an Army that supplied rations  plentifully. They grabbed their allotments and stood about while hastily  eating, uninterrupted by conversation or other concern. The French  soldiers took their very meager portions of food, improvised a kind of  table on the top of a flat rock, and having laid out the rations,  including the small quantity of wine that formed part of the repast, sat  down in comfort and began their meal amid a chatter of talk. One of the  non-French soldiers, all of whom had finished their large supply of food  before the French had begun eating, asked sardonically: \"Why do you  fellows make such a lot of fuss over the little bit of grub they give you  to eat?\" The Frenchman replied: \"Well, we are making war for civilization,  are we not? Very well, we are. Therefore, we eat in a civilized way.\"    To the French we owe the word etiquette, and it is amusing to discover its  origin in the commonplace familiar warning--\"Keep off the grass.\" It  happened in the reign of Louis XIV, when the gardens of Versailles were  being laid out, that the master gardener, an old Scotsman, was sorely  tried because his newly seeded lawns were being continually  trampled upon. To keep trespassers off, he put up warning signs or  tickets--_etiquettes_--on which was indicated the path along which to  pass. But the courtiers paid no attention to these directions and so the  determined Scot complained to the King in such convincing manner that His  Majesty issued an edict commanding everyone at Court to \"keep within the  _etiquettes_.\" Gradually the term came to cover all the rules for correct  demeanor and deportment in court circles; and thus through the centuries  it has grown into use to describe the conventions sanctioned for the  purpose of smoothing personal contacts and developing tact and good  manners in social intercourse. With the decline of feudal courts and the  rise of empires of industry, much of the ceremony of life was discarded  for plain and less formal dealing. Trousers and coats supplanted doublets  and hose, and the change in costume was not more extreme than the change  in social ideas. The court ceased to be the arbiter of manners, though the  aristocracy of the land remained the high exemplar of good breeding.    Yet, even so courtly and materialistic a mind as Lord Chesterfield's  acknowledged a connection between manners and morality, of which latter  the courts of Europe seemed so sparing. In one of the famous \"Letters to  His Son\" he writes: \"Moral virtues are the foundation of society in  general, and of friendship in particular; but attentions, manners, and  graces, both adorn and strengthen them.\" Again he says: \"Great merit, or  great"]]]
