It was mainly, if not entirely, owing to rain that  the French lost the Battle of Agincourt; whilst, if I mistake not,  Confucius alone knows how many victories have been snatched from the  Chinese by the same factor.    It was most certainly rain that drove Leon Hamar to take refuge in a  second-hand bookshop; for so deep-rooted was his aversion to any  literature saving a financial gazette or the stock and shares column  of a daily, that nothing would have induced him to get within touching  distance of a book save the risk of a severe wetting. Now, to his  unutterable disgust, he found himself surrounded by the things he  loathed. Books ancient--very ancient, judging by their bindings--and  modern--histories, biographies, novels and magazines--anything from  ten dollars to five cents, and all arrayed with most laudable tact  according to their bulk and condition. But Hamar was neither to be  tempted nor mollified. He frowned at one and all alike, and the  colossal edition of Miss Somebody or Other's poems--that by reason of  its magnificent cover of crimson and gold occupied a most prominent  position--met with the same vindictive reception as the tattered and  torn volumes of Whittier stowed away in an obscure corner.    Backing still further into the entrance of the store for a better  protection from the rain, which, now falling heavier and heavier, was  blown in by the wind, Hamar collided with a stand of books, with the  result that one of them fell with a loud bang on the pavement.    A man, evidently the owner of the store, and unmistakably a Jew,  instantly appeared. Picking up the book, and wiping it with a dirty  handkerchief, he thrust it at Hamar.    \"See!\" he said, \"you have damaged this property of mine. You must  either buy it or give me adequate compensation.\"    \"What!\" Hamar cried, \"compensation for such rubbish as that? Why all  your books together are not worth five dollars. Indeed I've seen twice  as many sold at a sale for half that amount. You can't Jew me!\"    The two men eyed each other quizzically.    \"Perhaps,\" the owner of the store observed slowly, \"perhaps some of  your ancestors were once Yiddish. In which case there ought to be a  bond of sympathy between us. You may have that book for a nickel.  What, no! Your cheeks are hollow, your fingers thin. A nickel is too  much for you. I will take your chain in exchange.\"    \"And leave me the watch!\" Hamar retorted, with a grim smile. \"You are  a philanthropist--not a storekeeper.\"    \"I should leave you nothing!\" the Jew laughed.    \"There's no watch there! See!\" and he pointed to the concave surface  of the watch-pocket. \"I noticed its absence at once. It's been keeping  you alive for some days past. I'll give you four dollars on the  chain--and you may have the book!\"    \"The book's no good to me!\" Hamar grunted. \"The money is. Here! hand  me over the four dollars and you can have the chain. It's eighteen  carat gold and worth at least ten dollars.\"    \"Then why not take it to some one who will give you ten dollars!\"  sneered the Jew. \"Because you know better. You're no greenhorn. That  chain is fifteen carat at the most, and there's not a man in this city  who would give you more than four dollars for it.\"    \"Very well, then!\" Hamar said sulkily. \"I agree. No! the money first.\"    The Jew dived deep down into his trouser pocket, and, after foraging  about for some seconds, produced a handful of greasy coins, out of  which he carefully selected the sum named.    Hamar, who had been watching him greedily, grabbed the coins, bit them  with his teeth, and rang them on the counter. With an air of relief he  then slipped his watch-chain into the outstretched palm before him,  remarked upon the fact that the rain had suddenly ceased, and prepared  to take his departure.    \"Here's the book!\" the Jew ejaculated, whilst his face became suffused  with a smirk. \"Don't go without it. Now! there's no knowing but what  we may not have further dealings with one another. I'm a  money-lender--I've a place down-stairs--I take all sorts of  things--all sorts of things. On the strict Q.T. mind. Sabez!\"    In another moment Hamar found himself standing on the wet pavement,  nursing the four dollars in his waistcoat pocket with one hand, and  mechanically clutching the despised volume with the other. Had he ever  acted upon impulse, he would most certainly have hurled the book into  the gutter; but on second thoughts he came to the conclusion that it  would be better to dispose of it less obstrusively.    It was now evening, and having tasted nothing since mid-day, he  realized, for at least the hundredth time that week, that he was  hungry. The touch of the dollars, however, only made him smile. He  could eat his full for twenty-five cents and yet live well for another  four days. And, besides, he still had a tie-pin and a fur coat. He  might get a dollar on the one and two, if not two and a half, on the  other; which would carry him through till the end of the week when  something else might turn up--something which would not involve too  hard work and would just keep him clear of jail. He turned sharply  down Montgomery Street, crossed Kearney Street, and slipped  noiselessly through the side doorway of a restaurant, in a  suspicious-looking alley, not a hundred yards distant from the  gorgeously illuminated Palace Hotel. Here, within five minutes, he was  served with as good a meal as one could get in San Francisco for the  money--and if the table linen was not as clean as it might have been,  the food was not a whit the less excellent for that. At least so Hamar  thought; and it was not until there was nothing left to eat that he  left off eating. When he thought no one was looking in his direction,  he popped the despised book under his chair and rose to go. Before he  had gone ten yards, however, one of the waiters came running after  him.    \"Hi, sir, stop, sir!\" the fellow cried. \"You've left something  behind!\" And in spite of Hamar's denials the officious menial  persisted the book was his. In the end Hamar was obliged to submit.  He took the book, and rewarded the waiter with curses.    Hamar next tried to dispose of it down the area of a Chinese laundry;  but a policeman saw him, and he only escaped being taken up on  suspicion, by parting with a dollar. This was the climax. He did not  dare make any further attempt to dispose of the book, but, with bitter  hatred in his heart, tucked it savagely under his arm, and made direct  for his room in 115th Street.    To his annoyance--for under the circumstances he preferred to be  alone--he found two men sitting in front of his empty hearth. They  were Matt Kelson and Ed Curtis; both of whom had been his colleagues  at Meidler, Meidler & Co., in Sacramento Street, and like himself had  been thrown out of work when the firm had \"smashed.\" Since that affair  Hamar had studiously avoided them. It was true he had once been as  friendly with them as he deemed it politic to be friendly with any  one; but now--they were out of employment, and in danger of  starvation. That made all the difference. He did not believe in  poverty encouraging poverty, any more than he believed in charity  among beggars. He had nothing to share with them, not even a thought;  and resolving to get rid of his quondam friends as soon as possible,  he confined his welcome to a frown.    \"Hulloa! what's the matter?\" Kelson exclaimed. \"When a man frowns like  that, it usually means he is crossed in love.\"    \"Or has an empty stomach, which amounts to the same thing,\" Curtis  interposed. \"Come--let the sun loose, Leon! We've good news for  you!--haven't we, Matt?\"    Kelson nodded.    \"What is it, then?\" Hamar grunted. \"Have you both got cancer?\"    \"No! We've come to borrow from you!\"    \"Then you've come to the wrong shop!

LONDON:  ELLIOT STOCK, 62, PATERNOSTER ROW.    1897.          PREFACE.    The book called 'The Consolation of Philosophy' was throughout the  Middle Ages, and down to the beginnings of the modern epoch in the  sixteenth century, the scholar's familiar companion. Few books have  exercised a wider influence in their time. It has been translated into  every European tongue, and into English nearly a dozen times, from King  Alfred's paraphrase to the translations of Lord Preston, Causton,  Ridpath, and Duncan, in the eighteenth century. The belief that what  once pleased so widely must still have some charm is my excuse for  attempting the present translation. The great work of Boethius, with its  alternate prose and verse, skilfully fitted together like dialogue and  chorus in a Greek play, is unique in literature, and has a pathetic  interest from the time and circumstances of its composition. It ought  not to be forgotten. Those who can go to the original will find their  reward. There may be room also for a new translation in English after an  interval of close on a hundred years.    Some of the editions contain a reproduction of a bust purporting to  represent Boethius. Lord Preston's translation, for example, has such a  portrait, which it refers to an original in marble at Rome. This I have  been unable to trace, and suspect that it is apocryphal. The Hope  Collection at Oxford contains a completely different portrait in a  print, which gives no authority. I have ventured to use as a  frontispiece a reproduction from a plaster-cast in the Ashmolean Museum,  taken from an ivory diptych preserved in the Bibliotheca Quiriniana at  Brescia, which represents Narius Manlius Boethius, the father of the  philosopher. Portraiture of this period is so rare that it seemed that,  failing a likeness of the author himself, this authentic representation  of his father might have interest, as giving the consular dress and  insignia of the time, and also as illustrating the decadence of  contemporary art. The consul wears a richly-embroidered cloak; his right  hand holds a staff surmounted by the Roman eagle, his left the _mappa  circensis,_ or napkin used for starting the races in the circus; at his  feet are palms and bags of money--prizes for the victors in the games.  For permission to use this cast my thanks are due to the authorities of  the Ashmolean Museum, as also to Mr. T.W. Jackson, Curator of the Hope  Collection, who first called my attention to its existence.    I have to thank my brother, Mr. L. James, of Radley College, for much  valuable help and for correcting the proof-sheets of the translation.  The text used is that of Peiper, Leipsic, 1874.          PROEM.    Anicus Manlius Severinus Boethius lived in the last quarter of the fifth  century A.D., and the first quarter of the sixth. He was growing to  manhood, when Theodoric, the famous Ostrogoth, crossed the Alps and made  himself master of Italy. Boethius belonged to an ancient family, which  boasted a connection with the legendary glories of the Republic, and was  still among the foremost in wealth and dignity in the days of Rome's  abasement. His parents dying early, he was brought up by Symmachus, whom  the age agreed to regard as of almost saintly character, and afterwards  became his son-in-law. His varied gifts, aided by an excellent  education, won for him the reputation of the most accomplished man of  his time. He was orator, poet, musician, philosopher. It is his peculiar  distinction to have handed on to the Middle Ages the tradition of Greek  philosophy by his Latin translations of the works of Aristotle. Called  early to a public career, the highest honours of the State came to him  unsought. He was sole Consul in 510 A.D., and was ultimately raised by  Theodoric to the dignity of Magister Officiorum, or head of the whole  civil administration. He was no less happy in his domestic life, in the  virtues of his wife, Rusticiana, and the fair promise of his two sons,  Symmachus and Boethius; happy also in the society of a refined circle of  friends. Noble, wealthy, accomplished, universally esteemed for his  virtues, high in the favour of the Gothic King, he appeared to all men a  signal example of the union of merit and good fortune. His felicity  seemed to culminate in the year 522 A.D., when, by special and  extraordinary favour, his two sons, young as they were for so exalted an  honour, were created joint Consuls and rode to the senate-house  attended by a throng of senators, and the acclamations of the multitude.  Boethius himself, amid the general applause, delivered the public speech  in the King's honour usual on such occasions. Within a year he was a  solitary prisoner at Pavia, stripped of honours, wealth, and friends,  with death hanging over him, and a terror worse than death, in the fear  lest those dearest to him should be involved in the worst results of his  downfall. It is in this situation that the opening of the 'Consolation  of Philosophy' brings Boethius before us. He represents himself as  seated in his prison distraught with grief, indignant at the injustice  of his misfortunes, and seeking relief for his melancholy in writing  verses descriptive of his condition. Suddenly there appears to him the  Divine figure of Philosophy, in the guise of a woman of superhuman  dignity and beauty, who by a succession of discourses convinces him of  the vanity of regret for the lost gifts of fortune, raises his mind once  more to the contemplation of the true good, and makes clear to him the  mystery of the world's moral government.

Philosophy appears to       Boethius, drives away the Muses of Poetry, and herself laments       (Song II.) the disordered condition of his mind.--CH. II. Boethius       is speechless with amazement. Philosophy wipes away the tears that       have clouded his eyesight.--CH. III. Boethius recognises his       mistress Philosophy. To his wondering inquiries she explains her       presence, and recalls to his mind the persecutions to which       Philosophy has oftentimes from of old been subjected by an ignorant       world. CH. IV. Philosophy bids Boethius declare his griefs. He       relates the story of his unjust accusation and ruin. He concludes       with a prayer (Song V.) that the moral disorder in human affairs       may be set right.--CH. V. Philosophy admits the justice of       Boethius' self-vindication, but grieves rather for the unhappy       change"]]]
