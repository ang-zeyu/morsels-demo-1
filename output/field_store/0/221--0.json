London    George Bell & Sons, York St., Covent Garden, and New York    1894    Reprinted from Stereotype Plates by Wm. Clowes & Sons, Ltd., Stamford  Street and Charing Cross                PREFACE.      No apologies are needed for a new edition of so favourite an author as  Plutarch. From the period of the revival of classical literature in  Europe down to our own times, his writings have done more than those of  any other single author to familiarise us with the greatest men and the  greatest events of the ancient world.    The great Duke of Marlborough, it is said, confessed that his only  knowledge of English history was derived from Shakespeare's historical  plays, and it would not be too much to say that a very large proportion  of educated men, in our own as well as in Marlborough's times, have owed  much of their knowledge of classical antiquity to the study of  Plutarch's Lives. Other writers may be read with profit, with  admiration, and with interest; but few, like Plutarch, can gossip  pleasantly while instructing solidly; can breathe life into the dry  skeleton of history, and show that the life of a Greek or Roman worthy,  when rightly dealt with, can prove as entertaining as a modern novel. No  one is so well able as Plutarch to dispel the doubt which all schoolboys  feel as to whether the names about which they read ever belonged to men  who were really alive; his characters are so intensely human and  lifelike in their faults and failings as well as in their virtues, that  we begin to think of them as of people whom we have ourselves personally  known.    His biographies are numerous and short. By this, he avoids one of the  greatest faults of modern biographers, that namely of identifying  himself with some one particular personage, and endeavouring to prove  that all his actions were equally laudable. Light and shade are as  necessary to a character as to a picture, but a man who devotes his  energies for years to the study of any single person's life, is  insensibly led into palliating or explaining away his faults and  exaggerating his excellencies until at last he represents him as an  impossible monster of virtue. Another advantage which we obtain by his  method is that we are not given a complete chronicle of each person's  life, but only of the remarkable events in it, and such incidents as  will enable us to judge of his character. This also avoids what is the  dreariest part of all modern biographies, those chapters I mean which  describe the slow decay of their hero's powers, his last illness, and  finally his death. This subject, which so many writers of our own time  seem to linger lovingly upon, is dismissed by Plutarch in a few lines,  unless any circumstance of note attended the death of the person  described.    Without denying that Plutarch is often inaccurate and often diffuse;  that his anecdotes are sometimes absurd, and his metaphysical  speculations not unfrequently ridiculous, he is nevertheless generally  admitted to be one of the most readable authors of antiquity, while all  agree that his morality is of the purest and loftiest type.    The first edition of the Greek text of Plutarch's Lives appeared at  Florence in the year 1517, and two years afterwards it was republished  by Aldus. Before this, however, about the year 1470, a magnificent Latin  version by various hands appeared at Rome. From this, from the Greek  text, and also from certain MSS. to which he had access, Amyot in the  year 1559 composed his excellent translation, of which it has been well  said: \"Quoique en vieux Gaulois, elle a un air de fraicheur qui la fait  rejeunir de jour en jour.\"    Amyot's spirited French version was no less spiritedly translated by Sir  Thomas North. His translation was much read and admired in its day; a  modern reviewer even goes so far as to say that it is \"still beyond  comparison the best version of Parallel Lives which the English tongue  affords.\" Be this as it may, the world will ever be deeply indebted to  North's translation, for it is to Shakespeare's perusal of that work  that we owe 'Coriolanus,' 'Antony and Cleopatra,' and 'Julius Caesar.'    North's translation was followed by that known as Dryden's. This work,  performed by many different hands, is of unequal merit. Some Lives are  rendered into a racy and idiomatic, although somewhat archaic English,  while others fall far short of the standard of Sir Thomas North's work.  Dryden's version has during the last few years been re-edited by A.H.  Clough, Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford.    The translation by which Plutarch is best known at the present day is  that of the Langhornes. Their style is certainly dull and commonplace,  and is in many instances deserving of the harsh epithets which have been  lavished upon it. We must remember, however, before unsparingly  condemning their translation, that the taste of the age for which they  wrote differed materially from that of our own, and that people who  could read the 'Letters of Theodosius and Constantia' with interest,  would certainly prefer Plutarch in the translation of the Langhornes to  the simpler phrases of North's or Dryden's version. All events, comic or  tragic, important or commonplace, are described with the same inflated  monotony which was mistaken by them for the dignity of History. Yet  their work is in many cases far more correct as a translation, and the  author's meaning is sometimes much more clearly expressed, than in  Dryden's earlier version. Langhorne's Plutarch was re-edited by  Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1819.    In 1844, thirteen Lives were translated by that eminent scholar the late  Mr. George Long; and it is by way of complement to these Lives that the  present version was undertaken with his consent and his approval.    Those translated by Mr. Long were selected by him as illustrating a  period of Roman history in which he was especially interested, and will  therefore be found to be more fully annotated than the others. It has  seemed to me unnecessary to give information in the notes which can at  the present day be obtained in a more convenient form in Dr. Smith's  Classical Dictionary and Dictionary of Antiquities, many of the articles  in which are written by Mr. Long himself. The student of classical  literature will naturally prefer the exhaustive essays to be found in  these works to any notes appended to Plutarch's text, while to those who  read merely \"for the story,\" the notes prove both troublesome and  useless.    In deciding on the spelling of the Greek proper names, I have felt great  hesitation. To make a Greek speak of Juno or Minerva seems as absurd as  to make a Roman swear by Herakles or Ares. Yet both Greek and Roman  divinities are constantly mentioned. The only course that seemed to  avoid absolute absurdity appeared to me to be that which I have adopted,  namely to speak of the Greek divinities by their Greek, and the Latin  ones by their Latin names. In substituting a k for the more usual c, I  have followed the example of Grote, who in his History spells all Greek  names exactly as they are written, with the exception of those with  which we are so familiar in their Latin form as to render this  practically impossible; as for instance in the case of Cyprus or  Corinth, or of a name like Thucydides, where a return to the Greek k  would be both pedantic and unmeaning.    The text, which I have followed throughout, is that of C. Sintenis,  Leipsic, 1873.    AUBREY STEWART.          PREFACE TO THE CIVIL WARS OF ROME.[A]    [Footnote A: It has been thought desirable to give here Mr. Long's  preface to the lives published by him, under the title of \"Civil Wars of  Rome.\" The lives will be found in subsequent volumes.]      Among the extant Lives of Plutarch there are thirteen Lives of Romans  which belong to the most eventful period of Roman history. They are the  lives of the brothers Tiberius and Caius Sempronius Gracchus, of Caius  Marius, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Quintus Sertorius, Marcus Licinius  Crassus, Cneius Pompeius Magnus, Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, Marcus  Tullius Cicero, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, Caius Julius Caesar, Marcus  Junius Brutus, and Marcus Antonius. From the year of the death of  Tiberius Gracchus, B.C. 133, to the death of Marcus Antonius, B.C. 30, a  period of about one hundred years, the Roman State was convulsed by  revolutions which grew out of the contest between the People and the  Nobility, or rather, out of the contests between the leaders of these  two bodies. This period is the subject of Appian's History of the Civil  Wars of the Romans, in Five Books. Appian begins with the Tribunate and  legislation of Tiberius Gracchus, from which he proceeds to the  Dictatorship of Sulla, and then to the quarrels between Pompeius and  Caesar, and Caesar's Dictatorship and assassination. He then proceeds to  the history of the Triumvirate formed after Caesar's death by his great  nephew Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus, Marcus Antonius, and Lepidus, the  quarrels of the Triumviri, the downfall of Lepidus, who was reduced to  the condition of a private person, and the death of Sextus Pompeius, the  last support of the party in whose cause his father, Cneius Pompeius,  lost his life. The remainder of this History, which is lost, carried the  narration down to the quarrels of Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, which  ended in the defeat of Antonius in the battle of Actium, B.C. 31, and  his death in Egypt, B.C. 30. The victory over Antonius placed all the  power in the hands of Octavianus, who, in the year B.C. 27, received  from the Roman Senate the title of Augustus, or the Sacred, by which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the lovely original illustrations.

AUTHOR'S NOTE      It should be stated here that, with the exception of one reproduction  after the Neo-Impressionist Van Rysselberghe, the other forty-nine  engravings illustrating this volume I owe to the courtesy of M.  Durand-Ruel, from the first the friend of the Impressionist painters,  and later the most important collector of their works, a friend who has  been good enough to place at our disposal the photographs from which our  illustrations have been reproduced. Chosen from a considerable  collection which has been formed for thirty years past, these  photographs, none of which are for sale, form a veritable and unique  museum of documents on Impressionist art, which is made even more  valuable through the dispersal of the principal masterpieces of this art  among the private collections of Europe and America. We render our  thanks to M. Durand-Ruel no less in the name of the public interested in  art, than in our own.          CONTENTS      AUTHOR'S NOTE      I.

Portraits of Madame van Rysselberghe and her     Daughter          NOTE TO LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS      The illustrations contained in this volume have been taken from  different epochs of the Impressionist movement. They will give but a  feeble idea of the extreme abundance of its production.    Banished from the salons, exhibited in private galleries and sold direct  to art lovers, the Impressionist works have been but little seen. The  series left by Caillebotte to the Luxembourg Gallery is very badly shown  and is composed of interesting works which, however, date back to the  early period, and are very inferior to the beautiful productions which  followed later. Renoir is best represented. The private galleries in  Paris, where the best Impressionist works are to be found, are those of  MM. Durand-Ruel, Rouart, de Bellis, de Camondo, and Manzi, to which must  be added the one sold by MM. Theodore Duret and Faure, and the one of  Mme. Ernest Rouart, daughter of Mme. Morisot, the sister-in-law of  Manet. The public galleries of M. Durand-Ruel's show-rooms are the place  where it is easiest to find numerous Impressionist pictures.    In spite of the firm opposition of the official juries, a place of  honour was reserved at the Exposition of 1889 for Manet, and at that of  1900 a fine collection of Impressionists occupied two rooms and caused a  considerable stir.    Amongst the critics who have most faithfully assisted this group of  artists, I must mention, besides the early friends previously referred  to, Castagnary, Burty, Edouard de Goncourt, Roger Marx, Geffroy, Arsene  Alexandre, Octave Mirbeau, L. de Fourcaud, Clemenceau, Mallarme,  Huysmans, Jules Laforgue, and nearly all the critics of the Symbolist  reviews. A book on \"Impressionist Art\" by M. Georges Lecomte has been  published by the firm of Durand-Ruel as an _edition-de-luxe_. But the  bibliography of this art consists as yet almost exclusively of articles  in journals and reviews and of some isolated biographical pamphlets.  Manet is, amongst many, the one who has excited most criticism of all  kinds; the articles, caricatures and pamphlets relating to his work  would form a considerable collection. It should be added that, with the  exception of Manet two years before his death, and Renoir last year at  the age of sixty-eight, no Impressionist has been decorated by the  French government. In England such a distinction has even less  importance in itself than elsewhere. But if I insist upon it, it is only  to draw attention to the fact that, through the sheer force of their  talent, men like Degas, Monet and Pissarro have achieved great fame and  fortune, without gaining access to the Salons, without official  encouragement, decoration, subvention or purchases for the national  museums. This is a very significant instance and serves well to complete  the physiognomy of this group of independents.          I    THE PRECURSORS OF IMPRESSIONISM--THE BEGINNING OF THIS MOVEMENT AND THE  ORIGIN OF ITS NAME      It will be beyond the scope of this volume to give a complete history of  French Impressionism, and to include all the attractive details to which  it might lead, as regards the movement itself and the very curious epoch  during which its evolution has taken place. The proportions of this book  confine its aim to the clearest possible summing up for the British  reader of the ideas, the personalities and the works of a considerable  group of artists who, for various reasons, have remained but little  known and who have only too frequently been gravely misjudged. These  reasons are very obvious: first, the Impressionists have been unable to  make a show at the Salons, partly because the jury refused them  admission, partly because they held aloof of their own free will. They  have, with very rare exceptions, exhibited at special minor galleries,  where they become known to a very restricted public. Ever attacked, and  poor until the last few years, they enjoyed none of the benefits of  publicity and sham glory. It is only quite recently that the admission  of the incomplete and badly arranged Caillebotte collection to the  Luxembourg Gallery has enabled the public to form a summary idea of  Impressionism. To conclude the enumeration of the obstacles, it must be  added that there are hardly any photographs of Impressionist works in  the market. As it is, photography is but a poor translation of these  canvases devoted to the study of the play of light; but even this very  feeble means of distribution has been withheld from them! Exhibited at  some galleries, gathered principally by Durand-Ruel, sold directly to  art-lovers--foreigners mostly--these large series of works have  practically remained unknown to the French public. All the public heard  was the reproaches and sarcastic comments of the opponents, and they  never became aware that in the midst of modern life the greatest, the  richest movement was in progress, which the French school had known  since the days of Romanticism. Impressionism has been made known to them  principally by the controversies and by the fruitful consequences of  this movement for the illustration and study of contemporary life.
