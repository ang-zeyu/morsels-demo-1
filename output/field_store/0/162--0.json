Where I have been obliged to use technical anatomical  and physiological terms I have either explained their meaning in the text,  aided by diagrams and figures, or I have given in brackets the English  equivalents of the terms used.    I trust my attempt to give a sketch of the mechanism of the human voice,  and how it is produced in speech and song, may prove of interest to the  general public, and I even hope that teachers of voice production may find  some of the pages dealing with the brain mechanism not unworthy of their  attention.

Before, however, passing to consider  in detail the instrument, I will briefly direct your attention to some  facts and theories regarding the origin of speech.          THEORIES ON THE ORIGIN OF SPEECH      The evolutionary theory is thus propounded by Romanes in his \"Mental  Evolution in Man,\" pp. 377-399: \"Starting from the highly intelligent and  social species of anthropoid ape as pictured by Darwin, we can imagine that  this animal was accustomed to use its voice freely for the expression of  the emotions, uttering danger signals, and singing. Possibly it may also  have been sufficiently intelligent to use a few imitative sounds; and  certainly sooner or later the receptual life of this social animal must  have advanced far enough to have become comparable with that of an infant  of about two years of age. That is to say, this animal, although not yet  having begun to use articulate signs, must have advanced far enough in the  conventional use of natural signs (a sign with a natural origin in tone and  gesture, whether spontaneously or intentionally imitative) to have admitted  of a totally free exchange of receptual ideas, such as would be concerned  in animal wants and even, perhaps, in the simplest forms of co-operative  action. Next I think it probable that the advance of receptual intelligence  which would have been occasioned by this advance in sign-making would in  turn have led to a development of the latter--the two thus acting and  reacting on each other until the language of tone and gesture became  gradually raised to the level of imperfect pantomime, as in children before  they begin to use words. At this stage, however, or even before it, I think  very probably vowel sounds must have been employed in tone language, if not  also a few consonants. Eventually the action and reaction of receptual  intelligence and conventional sign-making must have ended in so far  developing the former as to have admitted of the breaking up (or  articulation) of vocal sounds, as the only direction in which any  improvement in vocal sign-making was possible.\" Romanes continues his  sketch by referring to the probability that this important stage in the  development of speech was greatly assisted by the already existing habit of  articulating musical notes, supposing our progenitors to have resembled the  gibbons or the chimpanzees in this respect. Darwin in his great work on the  \"Expression of the Emotions\" points to the fact that the gibbon, the most  erect and active of the anthropoid apes, is able to sing an octave in  half-tones, and it is interesting to note that Dubois considers his  Pithecanthropus Erectus is on the same stem as the gibbon. But it has  lately been shown that some animals much lower in the scale than monkeys,  namely, rodents, are able to produce correct musical tones. Therefore the  argument loses force that the progenitors of man probably uttered musical  sounds before they had acquired the power of articulate speech, and that  consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion, it tends to  assume through the principle of association a musical character. The work  of anthropologists and linguists, especially the former, supports the  progressive-evolution theory, which, briefly stated, is--that articulate  language is the result of an elaboration in the long procession of ages in  which there occurred three stages--the cry, vocalisation, and articulation.  The cry is the primordial, pure animal language; it is a simple vocal  aspiration without articulation; it is either a reflex expressing needs and  emotions, or at a higher stage intentional (to call, warn, menace, etc.).  Vocalisation (emission of vowels) is a natural production of the vocal  instrument, and does not in itself contain the essential elements of  speech. Many animals are capable of vocalisation, and in the child the  utterance of vowel sounds is the next stage after the cry.    The conditions necessary to the existence of speech arose with  articulation, and it is intelligence that has converted the vocal  instrument into the speaking instrument. For whereas correct intonation  depends upon the innate musical ear, which is able to control and regulate  the tensions of the minute muscles acting upon the vocal cords, it is  intelligence which alters and changes the form of the resonator by means of  movement of the lips, tongue, and jaw in the production of articulate  speech. The simple musical instrument in the production of phonation is  bilaterally represented in the brain, but as a speaking instrument it is  unilaterally represented in right-handed individuals in the left hemisphere  and in left-handed individuals in the right hemisphere. The reason for this  we shall consider later; but the fact supports Darwin's hypothesis.    Another hypothesis which was brought forward by Grieger and supported by  some authors is summarised by Ribot as follows: \"Words are an imitation of  the movements of the mouth. The predominant sense in man is that of sight;  man is pre-eminently visual. Prior to the acquisition of speech he  communicated with his fellows by the aid of gestures and movement of the  mouth and face; he appealed to their eyes. Their facial 'grimaces,'  fulfilled and elucidated by gesture, became signs for others; they fixed  their attention upon them. When articulate sounds came into being, these  lent themselves to a more or less conventional language by reason of their  acquired importance.\" For support of this hypothesis the case of  non-educated deaf-mutes is cited. They invent articulate sounds which they  cannot hear and use them to designate certain things. Moreover, they employ  gesture language--a language which is universally understood.    Another theory of the origin of the speaking voice is that speech is an  instinct not evolved, but breaking forth spontaneously in man; but even if  this be so, it was originally so inadequate and weak that it required  support from the gesture language to become intelligible. This mixed  language still survives among some of the inferior races of men. Miss  Kingsley and Tylor have pointed out that tribes in Africa have to gather  round the camp fires at night in order to converse, because their  vocabulary is so incomplete that without being reinforced by gesture and  pantomime they would be unable to communicate with one another. Gesture is  indispensable for giving precision to vocal sounds in many languages, e.g.  those of the Tasmanians, Greenlanders, savage tribes of Brazil, and Grebos  of Western Africa.

[Illustration]      Frogmore is one of the most delightful of the still retreats of  Royalty. It was formerly the seat of the Hon. Mrs. Egerton, of whom it  was purchased by Queen Charlotte, in 1792, who made considerable  additions to the house and gardens. The grounds were laid out by Uvedale  Price, Esq. a celebrated person in the annals of picturesque gardening.  The ornamental improvements were made by the direction of the Princess  Elizabeth, (now Landgravine of Hesse Homburg,) whose taste for rural  quiet we noticed in connexion with an Engraving of Her Royal Highness'  Cottage, adjoining Old Windsor churchyard. [1]        [1]: See _Mirror_, No 475.    Frogmore occupies part of a fertile valley, which divides the Little  Park from Windsor Forest, and comprises about thirteen acres. Mr.  Hakewill describes it as \"diversified with great skill and taste, and a  piece of water winds throughout it with a pleasing variety of turn and  shape. The trees and shrubs, both native and exotic, which spread their  shade and diffuse their fragrance, are disposed with the best effect;  while buildings are so placed as to enliven and give character to the  general scene. The Ruin was designed by Mr. James Wyatt, and being  seated on the bank of the water, as well as in part in the wood, it  presents, with its creeping ivy and fractured buttresses, a most  pleasing object from various points of the garden. The _Hermitage (see  the Engraving)_ is a small circular thatched building, completely  embowered in lofty trees, and was constructed from a drawing of the  Princess Elizabeth. There is also a Gothic Temple, sacred to solitude,  and a well-imagined and picturesque barn, which heighten the appropriate  scenery. Too much cannot be said of the secluded beauty of this charming  spot, and nothing further need be said of the taste and judgment of  Major Price, to whom its arrangements have been entrusted.\"    The _Hermitage_ contains a tablet spread with fruit, eggs, and bread,  and a figure of a hermit reading the Scriptures; at the entrance are  the following lines, written on the marriage of the Princess Royal:--      Ye whom variety delights,    Descend awhile from Windsor's heights,    And in this hovel deign to tread,    Quitting the castle for the shed;    Such were the muse's favourite haunts,    From care secluded and from wants.    What nature needs this but can give,    Could we as nature dictates live;    For see, on this plain board at noon    Are placed a platter and a spoon,    Which, though they mark no gorgeous treat,    Suggest 'tis reasonable to eat.    What though the sun's meridian light    Beams not on our hovel bright,    Though others need, we need him not,    Coolness and gloom befit a cot.    Our hours we count without the sun.    These sands proclaim them as they run,    Sands within a glass confined,    Glass which ribs of iron bind;    For Time, still partial to this glass,    Made it durable as brass,    That, placed secure upon a shelf,    None might crush it but himself.    Let us here the day prolong    With loyal and with nuptial song,    Such as, with duteous strains addrest,    May gratify each royal guest;    Thrice happy, should our rural toils    Be requited by their smiles.    There are other affectionate testimonials in the grounds. The Gothic  ruin contains an apartment fitted up as an oratory, ornamented with a  copy of the Descent from the Cross, modelled in chalk, after the  celebrated painting by Rembrandt; busts of George III. and the Duke of  Kent; a posthumous marble figure of an infant child of his present  Majesty; and an alto-relievo representing an ascending spirit attended  by a guardian angel with the inscription--                 Monumental Tablet                 To the Memory                     of    Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte.             *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT WAGES TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.    (_For the Mirror._)      Chamberlayne, in his _Angliae Notitia_, says, \"Although the lords of  parliament are to bear their own charges, because they represent there  only themselves; yet all the commons, both lay and clergy, that is,  _Procuratores Cleri_, are to have _rationales expensus_, (as the words  of the writ are) that is, such allowance as the king considering the  prices of all things, shall judge meet to impose upon the people to pay.  In the 17th of Edward II. it was ten groats for knights, and five groats  for burgesses; but not long after it was four shillings for all others,  which in those days, as appears by the prices of all things, was a  considerable sum, above ten times more than it is now, (1688) for not  only then expenses were considered, though that was great by reason of  the suitable attendance that then every parliament-man had, but also  their pains, their loss of time, and necessary neglect of their own  private affairs for the service of their country; and when the counties,  cities, and boroughs paid so dear for their expenses, they were wont to  take care to chuse such men as were best able, and most diligent in the  speedy despatch of affairs; by which means, with some others, more  business in those times was despatched in parliament in a week, than is  now perhaps in ten; so that the protections for parliament-men and their  servants from arrests were not then grievous, when scarce any parliament  or sessions lasted so long as one of the four terms at Westminster.    \"The aforementioned expenses duly paid, did cause all the petty decayed  boroughs of England to become humble suitors to the king, that they  might not be obliged to send burgesses to parliament; whereby it came to  pass, that divers were unburgessed, as it was in particular granted to  _Chipping_, or _Market-Morriton_, upon their petition; and then the  number of the _Commons House_ being scarce half so many as at present,  then debates and bills were sooner expedited.\" page 156, 21st. edit.    Halsted, in his _History of Kent_, tells us, \"The pay of the burgesses  of Canterbury was fixed (anno 1411) at two shillings a-day for each,  while such burgess was absent from his family attending his duty. In  1445 the wages were no more than twelve pence a-day; two years  afterwards they were increased to sixteenpence, and in 1503 had again  been raised to two shillings. In Queen Mary's reign, the corporation  refused to continue this payment any longer, and the wages of the  members were then levied by assessment on the inhabitants at large, and  continued to be so raised till these kinds of payments were altogether  discontinued.\"    P.T.W.             *       *       *       *       *      THE WORD \"EI.\"    (_For the Mirror._)      This word, which was engraven on the temple of Apollo, at Delphi, has  occasioned much controversy among the literati. The learned and  admirable Plutarch tells us that it means \"thou art\" as if \"thou art  one.\" The Langhornes, in their life of this philosopher, [2] attack his  opinion as inconsistent with \"the whole tenour of the Heathen  Mythology.\" It in to be observed, that the Greek word for priests is  \"[Greek: iereis]\" (iereis). But I infer nothing from this; yet at the  same time it is a remarkable circumstance. The objection of the  Langhornes is frivolous; for the sun (Apollo) in most nations, was  considered chief of the gods, and this inscription was placed to prove  his _superiority and unity_.        [2] Langhorne's Plutarch, vol. i. p. xv.--Limbird's edition.    It is a very remarkable circumstance, that when the Pythia refused to  enter the temple, at the application of Alexander, \"Philip's godlike  son,\" and he attempting to force her in, she exclaimed--\"[Greek:  Anikaetos ei o pai]\" (My son, you are invincible.) Now, probably, she  had some other intention in using that word; but, however, that does not  affect the argument. I cannot but consider that Plutarch is right.
