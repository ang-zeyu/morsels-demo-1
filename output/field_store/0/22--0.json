By order of the War Office he obtained berths for us on the liner  _Morea_, of the P. and O. Line. We embarked at Marseilles on December  19, 1916, and after an uneventful journey reached Port Said on December  27.    At Cairo General Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in  Egypt, was good enough to put us in touch with Brig.-General II. G.  Casson, C.M.G., Director-in-Chief of the Prisoners of War Department.  With the help of Colonel Simpson we drew up a programme of visits. A  motor-car was placed at our disposal, and permission given us to take  photographs in the camps, distribute gifts among the prisoners, and  talk freely with them.    We have to express our warmest thanks to General Murray and to the  officers who allowed us to make our enquiries everywhere, without  restriction. We should also like to offer our deepest gratitude to Sir  Reginald Wingate, British High Commissioner in Egypt, for the kindly  care accorded us throughout our stay.          ~1. Heliopolis Camp.~    _(Visited on January 2, 1917.)_      This camp is laid out quite close to the new city of hotels and villas  founded in 1905 under the name of The Oasis of Heliopolis. The camp site  is 134 feet above the level of Cairo.      _Strength._--3,906 Turkish non-commissioned officers and men.    3 Turkish soldiers of the Sanitary Corps.    2 Armenian doctors (officers in the Turkish Army).    The camp is arranged to hold a total population of 15,000 men. A  barbed-wire fencing separates it from adjoining property.      _Accommodation._--The barracks for the prisoners are arranged in groups,  in parallel lines separated by passages 65 feet wide. These barracks,  built under the supervision of the Egyptian Engineering Department, are  of uniform construction, and about 42 feet long by 30 feet wide. They  are solid frames of wood with the spaces between filled in with reeds  arranged vertically and held in place by crossbars. The roof is of reed  thatch edged with tarred felt. Thanks to the design, the ventilation is  perfect. The sandy soil shows hardly a sign of dampness. The passage  between the rows of beds is made of hard-beaten earth which is very dry  and easily kept clean. All along this corridor, as in all the camp  roads, buckets full of water are arranged in readiness to meet an  outbreak of fire. The water in these buckets is not meant for drinking,  and therefore contains a little cresol to prevent prisoners drinking it.  The danger of fire is further reduced to a minimum by the fact that the  men smoke only out of doors and that the mildness of the climate does  away with the use of stoves. Each barrack accommodates 50 men.      _Bedding._--Each prisoner lies on a mat of plaited rush, and has four  blankets. Every morning the mats are brushed and rolled up and the  blankets folded, so that during the day there is a large clear space  inside the building. The detention cells have the same sleeping  accommodation.      _Exercise._--The space left between the barracks of the separate  sections is amply sufficient for exercise, which is quite unrestricted  during the regulation hours.      _Food._--Provisions are purchased by the commissariat and brought every  morning into a special barrack, whence each section draws its daily  rations. Bread comes from the Cairo bakeries. It is of good quality and  agreeable to the taste. The kitchens are in the open and heated by wood  fires. They are staffed by a detachment of prisoners under a head cook.  At meal times each section sends men to draw the rations for each room  in large metal bowls. Every man has his own spoon, bowl and drinking  cup, all of metal. The hours of meals are ordinarily as follows:      5 a.m.; 11 a.m.; and 4 p.m.    The last meal is the principal one of the day.    We have examined the various food materials given the prisoners and  found them to be of excellent quality.    The menu of the Turkish prisoners of war now interned in Heliopolis Camp  consists of bread, meat, vegetables, rice, butter, pepper, salt, onions,  tea (7-1/2 grammes), sugar (42 grammes), cheese and jam or olives.    Each prisoner receives 42-1/2 grammes of cigarettes and two boxes of  matches every week; two lbs. of firewood per day; and soap.    It interested us to make a note of the expenses involved by the support  of each Turkish prisoner, according to figures supplied by the English  authorities.    The calculation is based on a period of six months (in winter).                                          L    s.   d.

It sells  tea, coffee, and light refreshments. A cup of sweetened tea costs 5  paras, or about one-third of a penny. The canteen also deals in letter  paper, post-cards, thread, needles, buttons and other small odds and  ends.    The men receive 2 ounces of tobacco free every week. They never get  alcohol.      _Clothing._--Each prisoner is supplied with two complete sets of  underwear: shirts, drawers, and socks. The uniform consists of trousers  and coat of dark blue cloth. The brass buttons give it a military  appearance.    All the men wear the red fez. They are allowed to wear their  decorations. That they are prisoners is shown only by their having on  them a white metal plate about 1-1/2 inches in diameter, bearing a  registration number and the two letters P.W. (Prisoner of War). In our  opinion this kind of medallion is a more judicious form of indication  than the bands, armlets or large letters used elsewhere. In summer the  cloth uniforms are replaced by linen uniforms of the same cut and  colour.    All men wear indoors leather slippers of the Eastern kind. Shoes are  used only by prisoners engaged on gardening, and by non-commissioned  officers.    Linen, clothes and footwear are renewed on fixed dates or according to  need.      _Hygiene._--Everything that has to do with hygiene and the sanitation of  the camp is the province of Lieut.-Colonel E.G. Garner, Medical Office  Inspector of Prisoner-of-War Camps in Egypt.    Water is supplied from the Heliopolis town mains, is of good quality,  and is provided in sufficient quantities.    For toilet purposes the prisoners have the use twice a day of shower  baths and water taps. The floor of the lavatories is sloping cement, and  the water drains away through a gulley between the two rows of baths.  Prisoners can get hot water from the kitchen when they need it. Soap is  supplied _ad libitum_.    For washing their clothes the prisoners have some very convenient  arrangements. Once a week each prisoner's blankets and clothes are  passed through the disinfecting chamber and thoroughly sterilised.  Thanks to this precaution, there is not a trace of vermin to be found in  the camp.    Ten Turkish barbers are occupied in cutting the hair of prisoners and  shaving them in a well-managed barber's shop.    The latrines are clean and numerous enough. Some of them are on the  English system; the rest on the Turkish. They are disinfected daily with  carbolineum. All discharge into the sewers.      _Medical attention._--The camp medical service is staffed by Colonel  E.G. Garner and two Armenian doctors (Arsen Khoren and Leon Samuel).  Four English hospital orderlies are assisted by three Turkish orderlies.  An English dentist visits the camp at the doctor's request.    At the infirmary, which is clean and well looked after, all prisoners  not seriously ill are accommodated with beds having mattresses and steel  springs. The consulting room is well supplied with medicines. Serious  cases are sent to the hospitals set apart for prisoners of war.    From 20 to 30 men come to the infirmary daily for medical attention. All  the cases are entered in a register, which we have examined; after each  name is the complaint and the treatment prescribed.    At the time of our visit there were six lying-down cases in the  infirmary; two with tuberculosis in the first stage (prisoners captured  recently at El Arish); one with diarrhoea; one with conjunctivitis; one  with malaria; and one with a wounded leg.    Of the prisoners in camp 3 per cent. have been attacked by malaria--old  cases from the marshy districts of Turkey, such as Angora Yosgath, for  instance. Nine per cent. have been attacked by chronic bacillar  dysentery; these are treated periodically with anti-dysenteric serum.

It has been observed that men of eminence in all ages, and  distinguished for the same excellence, have generally had something in  their lives similar to each other. The place of Homer's nativity, has  not been more variously conjectured, or his parents more differently  assigned than our author's. Leland, who lived nearest to Chaucer's  time of all those who have wrote his life, was commissioned by king  Henry VIII, to search all the libraries, and religious houses in  England, when those archives were preserved, before their destruction  was produced by the reformation, or Polydore Virgil had consumed such  curious pieces as would have contradicted his framed and fabulous  history. He for some reasons believed Oxford or Berkshire to have  given birth to this great man, but has not informed us what those  reasons were that induced him to believe so, and at present there  appears no other, but that the seats of his family were in those  countries. Pitts positively asserts, without producing any authority  to support it, that Woodstock was the place; which opinion Mr. Camden  seems to hint at, where he mentions that town; but it may be suspected  that Pitts had no other ground for the assertion, than Chaucer's  mentioning Woodstock park in his works, and having a house there. But  after all these different pretensions, he himself, in the Testament of  Love, seems to point out the place of his nativity to be the city of  London, and tho' Mr. Camden mentions the claim of Woodstock, he  does not give much credit to it; for speaking of Spencer (who was  uncontrovertedly born in London) he calls him fellow citizen to  Chaucer.    The descent of Chaucer is as uncertain, and unfixed by the critics,  as the place of his birth. Mr. Speight is of opinion that one Richard  Chaucer was his father, and that one Elizabeth Chaucer, a nun of St.  Helen's, in the second year of Richard II. might have been his sister,  or of his kindred. But this conjecture, says Urry,[1] seems very  improbable; for this Richard was a vintner, living at the corner of  Kirton-lane, and at his death left his house, tavern, and stock to the  church of St. Mary Aldermary, which in all probability he would not  have done if he had had any sons to possess his fortune; nor is it  very likely he could enjoy the family estates mentioned by Leland in  Oxfordshire, and at the same time follow such an occupation. Pitts  asserts, that his father was a knight; but tho' there is no authority  to support this assertion, yet it is reasonable to suppose that he  was something superior to a common employ. We find one John Chaucer  attending upon Edward III. and Queen Philippa, in their expedition to  Flanders and Cologn, who had the King's protection to go over sea  in the twelfth year of his reign. It is highly probable that  this gentleman was father to our Geoffry, and the supposition is  strengthened by Chaucer's first application, after leaving the  university and inns of law, being to the Court; nor is it unlikely  that the service of the father should recommend the son.    It is universally agreed, that he was born in the second year of the  reign of King Edward III. A.D. 1328. His first studies were in the  university of Cambridge, and when about eighteen years of age he wrote  his Court of Love, but of what college he was is uncertain, there  being no account of him in the records of the University. From  Cambridge he was removed to Oxford in order to compleat his studies,  and after a considerable stay there, and a strict application to the  public lectures of the university, he became (says Leland) \"a ready  logician, a smooth rhetorician, a pleasant poet, a great philosopher,  an ingenious mathematician, and a holy divine. That he was a great  master in astronomy, is plain by his discourses of the Astrolabe. That  he was versed in hermetic philosophy (which prevailed much at that  time), appears by his Tale of the Chanons Yeoman: His knowledge in  divinity is evident from his Parson's Tale, and his philosophy from  the Testament of Love.\" Thus qualified to make a figure in the world,  he left his learned retirement, and travelled into France, Holland,  and other countries, where he spent some of his younger days. Upon his  return he entered himself in the Inner Temple, where he studied the  municipal laws of the land. But he had not long prosecuted that dry  study, till his superior abilities were taken notice of by some  persons of distinction, by whole patronage he then approached the  splendor of the court. The reign of Edward III. was glorious and  successful, he was a discerning as well as a fortunate Monarch; he had  a taste as well for erudition as for arms; he was an encourager of men  of wit and parts, and permitted them to approach him, without reserve.  At Edward's court nothing but gallantry and a round of pleasure  prevailed, and how well qualified our poet was to shine in the soft  circles, whoever has read his works, will be at no loss to determine;  but besides the advantages of his wit and learning, he possessed those  of person in a very considerable degree. He was then about the age of  thirty, of a fair beautiful complexion, his lips red and full, his  size of a just medium, and his air polished and graceful, so that he  united whatever could claim the approbation of the Great, and charm  the eyes of the Fair. He had abilities to record the valour of the  one, and celebrate the beauty of the other, and being qualified by his  genteel behaviour to entertain both, he became a finished courtier.  The first dignity to which we find him preferred, was that of page  to the king, a place of so much honour and esteem at that time, that  Richard II. leaves particular legacies to his pages, when few others  of his servants are taken notice of. In the forty-first year of Edward  III. he received as a reward of his services, an annuity of twenty  marks per ann. payable out of the Exchequer, which in those days was  no inconsiderable pension; in a year after he was advanced to be of  his Majesty's privy chamber, and a very few months to be his shield  bearer, a title, at that time, (tho' now extinct) of very great  honour, being always next the king's person, and generally upon signal  victories rewarded with military honours. Our poet being thus eminent  by his places, contracted friendships, and procured the esteem of  persons of the first quality. Queen Philippa, the Duke of Lancaster,  and his Duchess Blanch, shewed particular honour to him, and lady  Margaret the king's daughter, and the countess of Pembroke gave him  their warmest patronage as a poet. In his poems called the Romaunt,  and the Rose, and Troilus and Creseide, he gave offence to some court  ladies by the looseness of his description, which the lady Margaret  resented, and obliged him to atone for it, by his Legend of good  Women, a piece as chaste as the others were luxuriously amorous, and,  under the name of the Daisy, he veils lady Margaret, whom of all his  patrons he most esteemed.    Thus loved and honoured, his younger years were dedicated to pleasure  and the court. By the recommendation of the Dutchess Blanch, he  married one Philippa Rouet, sister to the guardianess of her grace's  children, who was a native of Hainault: He was then about thirty years  of age, and being fixed by marriage, the king began to employ him in  more public and advantageous posts. In the forty-sixth year of his  majesty's reign, Chaucer was sent to Venice in commission with others,  to treat with the Doge and Senate of Genoa, about affairs of great  importance to our state. The duke of Lancaster, whose favourite  passion was ambition, which demanded the assistance of learned  men, engaged warmly in our poet's interest; besides, the duke was  remarkably fond of Lady Catherine Swynford, his wife's sister, who  was then guardianess to his children, and whom he afterwards made his  wife; thus was he doubly attached to Chaucer, and with the varying  fortune of the duke of Lancaster we find him rise or fall. Much about  this time, for his successful negociations at Genoa, the king granted  to him by letters patent, by the title of Armiger Noster, one  pitcher of wine daily in the port of"]]]
