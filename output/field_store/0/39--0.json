WEBSTER,    _Author of \"Practical Forestry,\" \"Hardy Coniferous Trees,\"  \"British Orchids,\" &c., &c._          1897.          PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION, 1893.    This book has been written and is published with the distinct object  in view of bringing home to the minds of planters of Hardy Trees and  Shrubs, the fact that the monotonous repetition, in at least nine-tenths  of our Parks and Gardens, of such Trees as the Elm, the Lime, and the  Oak, and such Shrubs as the Cherry Laurel and the Privet, is neither  necessary nor desirable. There is quite a host of choice and beautiful  flowering species, which, though at present not generally known are yet  perfectly hardy, of the simplest culture, and equally well adapted for  the ornamentation of our Public and Private Parks and Gardens.    Of late years, with the marked decline in the cultivation of Coniferous  Trees, many of which are ill adapted for the climate of this country,  the interest in our lovely flowering Trees and Shrubs has been greatly  revived. This fact has been well exemplified in the numerous enquiries  after these subjects, and the space devoted to their description and  modes of cultivation in the Horticultural Press.    In the hope, too, of helping to establish a much-desired standard of  nomenclature, I have followed the generic names adopted by the authors  of _The Genera Plantarum_, and the specific names and orthography, as  far as I have been able, of the _Index Kewensis_; and where possible  I have given the synonyms, the date of introduction, and the native  country. The alphabetical arrangement that has been adopted, both with  regard to the genera and species, it is hoped, will greatly facilitate  the work of reference to its pages. The descriptive notes and hints on  cultivation, the selected lists of Trees and Shrubs for various special  purposes, and the calendarial list which indicates the flowering season  of the different species, may be considered all the more valuable for  being concisely written, and made readily accessible by means of the  Index.    No work written on a similar plan and treating solely of Hardy  Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs has hitherto been published;  and it is not supposed for a moment that the present one will entirely  supply the deficiency; but should it meet with any measure of public  approval, it may be the means of paving the way towards the publication  of a more elaborate work--and one altogether more worthy of the  interesting and beautiful Flowering Trees and Shrubs that have been  found suitable for planting in the climate of the British Isles.    Of the fully thirteen hundred species and varieties of Trees and Shrubs  enumerated, all may be depended upon as being hardy in some part of the  country. Several of them, and particularly those introduced from China  and Japan, have not before been included in a book of this character.  Trials for the special purpose of testing the hardiness of the more  tender kinds have been instituted and carried out in several favoured  parts of England and Ireland.    A.D.W.  HOLLYDALE, WOBURN.      PREFACE TO SECOND AND CHEAP EDITION, 1897.    The First Edition of Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs having  been sold out, it has been considered desirable to run off a second and  cheap edition on exactly similar lines to the first, and previous to the  more elaborate illustrated edition which is now in hand.    A.D.W.  BOXMOOR, HERTS, 1897.          HARDY ORNAMENTAL FLOWERING TREES & SHRUBS.      ABELIA.    ABELIA CHINENSIS (_syn A. rupestris_).--The Rock Abelia China, 1844.  This is a neat, twiggy shrub, growing from 2 ft. to 3 ft. high, with  slender shoots, and very pleasing, shining green serrated leaves. The  tubular, sweet-scented flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of  the shoots, even the smallest, and are of a very delicate shade of  pink--indeed, almost white. It makes an excellent wall plant, but by  no means refuses to grow and flower freely without either shelter or  protection, provided a fairly rich and well drained soil is provided.  From August to October is the flowering period of this handsome  deciduous shrub. This is the only really hardy species of the genus,  for though the rosy-purple flowered A. floribunda from Mexico has stood  for several years uninjured in the South of England, it is not to be  relied upon. Both species are readily propagated from cuttings.    A. TRIFLORA.--Himalayan regions, 1847. A half-hardy and beautiful  species with small lanceolate, entire leaves, and pretty star-shaped  flowers that are white and flushed with pink. The long, narrow, and  hairy calyx-lobes give a light and feathery appearance to the flowers,  which are produced continuously from May to November. It does best as a  wall plant, and several beautiful examples may be seen in and around  London, as also at Exeter, and in the South of Ireland.      ADENOCARPUS.    ADENOCARPUS DECORTICANS (_syn A. Boissieri_).--Spain, 1883. This little  known hardy shrub, a native of the Sierra Nevada mountains, in Spain, is  one of great beauty, and well worthy of extended culture. The flowers  are produced abundantly, and are of a bright yellow colour, resembling  those of our common Broom, to which family it is nearly allied. Peaty  soil suits it well, and repeated trials have clearly proved that it is  hardy, at least in the South of England.      AESCULUS.    AESCULUS CALIFORNICA (_syn Pavia californica_).--California. This is  one of the handsomest species, of low, spreading habit, and blooming  freely about midsummer.    AE. GLABRA (_syn Ae. rubicunda_).--Red-flowered Horse Chestnut. North  America, 1820. If only for its neat and moderate growth, and attractive  spikes of brightly-coloured flowers, this species must be considered as  one of the handsomest and most valuable of small growing trees. Being  of moderate size, for we rarely meet with specimens of greater height  than 30 feet, and of very compact habit, it is rendered peculiarly  suitable for planting in confined spots, and where larger growing and  more straggling subjects would be out of place. It withstands soot and  smoke well, and is therefore much valued for suburban planting. The  long spikes of pretty red flowers are usually produced in great  abundance, and as they stand well above the foliage, and are of firm  lasting substance, they have a most pleasing and attractive appearance.  As there are numerous forms of the red-flowered Horse Chestnut,  differing much in the depth of flower colouring, it may be well to warn  planters, for some of these have but a faint tinge of pink overlying a  dirty yellowish-green groundwork, while the finest and most desirable  tree has the flowers of a decided pinky-red. There is a double-flowered  variety Ae. glabra flore-pleno (_syn Ae. rubicunda flore-pleno_) and  one of particular merit named Ae. rubicunda Briotii.    AE. HIPPOCASTANUM.--The Common Horse Chestnut. Asia, 1629. A fine  hardy free-flowering tree, supposed to have been introduced from Asia,  and of which there are several varieties, including a double-flowered,  a variegated, and several lobed and cut-leaved forms. The tree needs  no description, the spikes of pinky-white flowers, which are produced  in great abundance, and ample foliage rendering it one of, if not the  handsomest tree of our acquaintance. It gives a pleasing shade, and  forms an imposing and picturesque object in the landscape, especially  where the conditions of soil--a rich free loam--are provided. Ae.  Hippocastanum alba flore-pleno (the double white Horse Chestnut), has  a decidedly pyramidal habit of growth, and the flowers, which are  larger than those of the species, are perfectly double. It is a very  distinct and desirable large growing tree. Ae. Hippocastanum laciniata  and Ae. Hippocastanum digitalis are valuable for their divided leaves;  while Ae. Hippocastanum foliis variegatis has the foliage rather  irregularly variegated.    AE. PARVIFLORA (_syn Pavia macrostachya_).--Buckeye. North America,  1820. This is very distinct, and possesses feature which are shared by  no other hardy tree or shrub in cultivation. Rarely exceeding 12 feet  in height, and with a spread of often as much as 20 feet, this shrub  forms a perfect hemisphere of foliage, and which, when tipped with the  pretty fragrant flowers, renders it one of the most effective and  handsome. The foliage is large, and resembles that of the common Horse  Chestnut, while the pure white flowers, with their long projecting  stamens and red-tipped anthers, are very pretty and imposing when at  their best in July. It succeeds well in rich, dampish loam, and as a  shrub for standing alone in any conspicuous position it has, indeed,  few equals.    AE. PAVIA (_syn Pavia rubra_).--Red Buckeye. North America, 1711. A  small growing and slender-branched tree or shrub, which bears an  abundance of brownish-scarlet flowers. There are several good  varieties, two of the best being Ae. Pavia atrosanguinea, and Ae.  Pavia Whittleyana, with small, brilliant red flowers.    There are several other species, such as Ae. Pavia humilis (_syn Pavia  humilis_) of trailing habit; Ae. flava (_syn Pavia flava_) bearing  pretty yellow flowers; Ae. Pavia macrocarpa (_syn Pavia macrocarpa_)  an open-headed and graceful tree; Ae. flava discolor (_syn Pavia  discolor_); and Ae. chinensis; but they have not been found very  amenable to cultivation, except in very favoured parts of the South of  England and Ireland.      AILANTHUS.    AILANTHUS GLANDULOSA.--Tree of Heaven. China, 1751. A handsome,  fast-growing tree, with large pinnate leaves that are often fully  three feet long, and terminal erect clusters of not very showy  greenish-white flowers that exhale a rather disagreeable odour. It is  one of the most distinct and imposing of pinnate-leaved trees, and  forms"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#1)"],[1,"STORIES FROM THE ITALIAN POETS: WITH LIVES OF THE WRITERS.      BY LEIGH HUNT.        IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I.          MDCCCXLVI.          TO SIR PERCY SHELLEY, BART.      MY DEAR SIR PERCY,    As I know no man who surpasses yourself either in combining a love of  the most romantic fiction with the coolest good sense, or in passing  from the driest metaphysical questions to the heartiest enjoyment of  humour,--I trust that even a modesty so true as yours will not grudge me  the satisfaction of inscribing these volumes with your name.    That you should possess such varieties of taste is no wonder,  considering what an abundance of intellectual honours you inherit; nor  might the world have been the better for it, had they been tastes, and  nothing more. But that you should inherit also that zeal for justice to  mankind, which has become so Christian a feature in the character of the  age, and that you should include in that zeal a special regard for the  welfare of your Father's Friend, are subjects of constant pleasurable  reflection to    Your obliged and affectionate    LEIGH HUNT.        PREFACE.      The purpose of these volumes is, to add to the stock of tales from the  Italian writers; to retain as much of the poetry of the originals as it  is in the power of the writer's prose to compass; and to furnish careful  biographical notices of the authors. There have been several collections  of stories from the Novellists of Italy, but none from the Poets; and it  struck me that prose versions from these, of the kind here offered to  the public, might not be unwillingly received. The stories are selected  from the five principal narrative poets, Dante, Pulci, Boiardo, Ariosto,  and Tasso; they comprise the most popular of such as are fit for  translation; are reduced into one continuous narrative, when diffused  and interrupted, as in the instances of those of Angelica, and Armida;  are accompanied with critical and explanatory notes; and, in the case of  Dante, consist of an abstract of the poet's whole work. The volumes are,  furthermore, interspersed with the most favourite _morceaux_ of the  originals, followed sometimes with attempts to versify them; and in the  Appendix, for the furtherance of the study of the Italian language, are  given entire stories, also in the original, and occasionally rendered  in like manner. The book is particularly intended for such students or  other lovers of the language as are pleased with any fresh endeavours to  recommend it; and, at the same time, for such purely English readers as  wish to know something about Italian poetry, without having leisure to  cultivate its acquaintance.    I did not intend in the first instance to depart from the plan  of selection in the case of Dante; but when I considered what an  extraordinary person he was,--how intense is every thing which he  says,--how widely he has re-attracted of late the attention of the  world,--how willingly perhaps his poem might be regarded by the reader  as being itself one continued story (which, in fact, it is), related  personally of the writer,--and lastly, what a combination of  difficulties have prevented his best translators in verse from giving  the public a just idea of his almost Scriptural simplicity,--I began to  think that an abstract of his entire work might possibly be looked upon  as supplying something of a desideratum. I am aware that nothing but  verse can do perfect justice to verse; but besides the imperfections  which are pardonable, because inevitable, in all such metrical  endeavours, the desire to impress a grand and worshipful idea of Dante  has been too apt to lead his translators into a tone and manner the  reverse of his passionate, practical, and creative style--a style which  may be said to write things instead of words; and thus to render every  word that is put out of its place, or brought in for help and filling  up, a misrepresentation. I do not mean to say, that he himself never  does any thing of the sort, or does not occasionally assume too much  of the oracle and the schoolmaster, in manner as well as matter;  but passion, and the absence of the superfluous, are the chief  characteristics of his poetry. Fortunately, this sincerity of purpose  and utterance in Dante render him the least pervertible of poets in a  sincere prose translation; and, since I ventured on attempting one, I  have had the pleasure of meeting with an express recommendation of such  a version in an early number of the _Edinburgh Review_.[1]    The abstract of Dante, therefore, in these volumes (with every  deprecation that becomes me of being supposed to pretend to give a  thorough idea of any poetry whatsoever, especially without its metrical  form) aspires to be regarded as, at all events, not exhibiting a false  idea of the Dantesque spirit in point of feeling and expression. It is  true, I have omitted long tedious lectures of scholastic divinity, and  other learned absurdities of the time, which are among the bars to the  poem's being read through, even in Italy (which Foscolo tells us is  never the case); and I have compressed the work in other passages not  essentially necessary to the formation of a just idea of the author.  But quite enough remains to suggest it to the intelligent; and in no  instance have I made additions or alterations. There is warrant--I hope  I may say letter--for every thing put down. Dante is the greatest poet  for intensity that ever lived; and he excites a corresponding emotion  in his reader--I wish I could say, always on the poet's side; but his  ferocious hates and bigotries too often tempt us to hate the bigot,  and always compel us to take part with the fellow-creatures whom he  outrages. At least, such is their effect on myself. Nor will he or his  worshippers suffer us to criticise his faults with mere reference to the  age in which he lived. I should have been glad to do so; but the claims  made for him, even by himself, will not allow it. We are called upon to  look on him as a divine, a prophet, an oracle in all respects for all  time. Such a man, however, is the last whom a reporter is inclined to  misrepresent. We respect his sincerity too much, ferocious and arrogant  though it be; and we like to give him the full benefit of the recoil of  his curses and maledictions. I hope I have not omitted one. On the  other hand, as little have I closed my feelings against the lovely  and enchanting sweetness which this great semi-barbarian sometimes so  affectingly utters. On those occasions he is like an angel enclosed  for penance in some furious giant, and permitted to weep through the  creature's eyes.    The stories from goodnatured Pulci I have been obliged to compress for  other reasons--chiefly their excessive diffuseness. A paragraph of the  version will sometimes comprise many pages. Those of Boiardo and Ariosto  are more exact; and the reader will be good enough to bear in mind, that  nothing is added to any of the poets, different as the case might seem  here and there on comparison with the originals. An equivalent for  whatever is said is to be found in some part of the context--generally  in letter, always in spirit. The least characteristically exact passages  are some in the love-scenes of Tasso; for I have omitted the plays upon  words and other corruptions in style, in which that poet permitted  himself to indulge. But I have noticed the circumstance in the comment.  In other respects, I have endeavoured to make my version convey some  idea of the different styles and genius of the writers,--of the severe  passion of Dante; of the overflowing gaiety and affecting sympathies  of Pulci, several of whose passages in the Battle of Roncesvalles are  masterpieces of pathos; of the romantic and inventive elegance of  Boiardo; the great cheerful universality of Ariosto, like a healthy  _anima mundi_; and the ambitious irritability, the fairy imagination,  and tender but somewhat effeminate voluptuousness of the poet of Armida  and Rinaldo. I do not pretend that prose versions of passages from these  writers can supersede the necessity of metrical ones, supposing proper  metrical ones attainable. They suffice for them, in some respects, less  than for Dante, the manner in their case being of more importance to  the effect. But with all due respect to such translators as Harrington,  Rose, and Wiffen, their books are not Ariosto and Tasso, even in manner.  Harrington, the gay \"godson\" of Queen Elizabeth, is not always unlike  Ariosto; but when not in good spirits he becomes as dull as if her  majesty had frowned on him. Rose was a man of wit, and a scholar; yet  he has undoubtedly turned the ease and animation of his original into  inversion and insipidity. And Wiffen, though elegant and even poetical,  did an unfortunate thing for Tasso, when he gave an additional line and  a number of paraphrastic thoughts to a stanza already tending to the  superfluous. Fairfax himself, who, upon the whole, and with regard to  a work of any length, is the best metrical translator our language has  seen, and, like Chapman, a genuine poet, strangely aggravated the sins  of prettiness and conceit in his original, and added to them a love  of tautology amounting to that of a lawyer. As to Hoole, he is below  criticism; and other versions I have not happened to see. Now if I had  no acquaintance with the Italian language, I confess I would rather get  any friend who had, to read to me a passage out of Dante, Tasso, or  Ariosto, into the first simple prose that offered itself, than go to any  of the above translators for a taste of it, Fairfax excepted; and we  have seen with how much allowance his sample would have to be taken.  I have therefore, with some restrictions, only ventured to do for the  public what I would have had a friend do for myself.
