The \"perfect language\" has been hitherto regarded as the  province of scholars, and few of these even have found time or taste to  search its treasures. And yet among them is the key to the heart of  modern India--as well as the splendid record of her ancient Gods and  glories. The hope of Hindostan lies in the intelligent interest of  England. Whatever avails to dissipate misconceptions between them, and  to enlarge their intimacy, is a gain to both peoples; and to this end  the present volume aspires, in an humble degree, to contribute.    The \"Hitopadesa\" is a work of high antiquity, and extended popularity.  The prose is doubtless as old as our own era; but the intercalated  verses and proverbs compose a selection from writings of an age  extremely remote. The \"Mahabharata\" and the textual Veds are of those  quoted; to the first of which Professor M. Williams (in his admirable  edition of the \"Nala,\" 1860) assigns a date of 350 B.C., while he claims  for the \"Rig-Veda\" an antiquity as high as B.C. 1300. The \"Hitopadesa\"  may thus be fairly styled \"The Father of all Fables\"; for from its  numerous translations have come AEsop and Pilpay, and in later days  Reineke Fuchs. Originally compiled in Sanscrit, it was rendered, by  order of Nushiravan, in the sixth century, A.D., into Persic. From the  Persic it passed, A.D. 850, into the Arabic, and thence into Hebrew and  Greek. In its own land it obtained as wide a circulation. The Emperor  Acbar, impressed with the wisdom of its maxims and the ingenuity of its  apologues, commended the work of translating it to his own Vizir, Abdul  Fazel. That minister accordingly put the book into a familiar style, and  published it with explanations, under the title of the \"Criterion of  Wisdom.\" The Emperor had also suggested the abridgment of the long  series of shlokes which here and there interrupt the narrative, and the  Vizir found this advice sound, and followed it, like the present  Translator. To this day, in India, the \"Hitopadesa,\" under other names  (as the \"Anvari Suhaili\"[1]), retains the delighted attention of young  and old, and has some representative in all the Indian vernaculars. A  work so well esteemed in the East cannot be unwelcome to Western  readers, who receive it here, a condensed but faithful transcript of  sense and manner.    As often as an Oriental allusion, or a name in Hindoo mythology, seemed  to ask some explanation for the English reader, notes have been  appended, bearing reference to the page. In their compilation, and  generally, acknowledgment is due to Professor Johnson's excellent  version and edition of the \"Hitopadesa,\" and to Mr. Muir's \"Sanscrit  Texts.\"    A residence in India, and close intercourse with the Hindoos, have given  the author a lively desire to subserve their advancement. No one listens  now to the precipitate ignorance which would set aside as \"heathenish\"  the high civilization of this great race; but justice is not yet done to  their past development and present capacities. If the wit, the morality,  and the philosophy of these \"beasts of India\" (so faithfully rendered by  Mr. Harrison Weir) surprise any vigorous mind into further exploration  of her literature, and deeper sense of our responsibility in her  government, the author will be repaid.    EDWIN ARNOLD.    [1] \"The Lights of Canopus,\" a Persian paraphrase; as the \"Khirad  Afroz,\" \"the lamp of the Understanding,\" is in Hindustani.          THE BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS    INTRODUCTION      HONOR TO GUNESH, GOD OF WISDOM        This book of Counsel read, and you shall see,      Fair speech and Sanscrit lore, and Policy.    ON the banks of the holy river Ganges there stood a city named  Pataliputra. The King of it was a good King and a virtuous, and his name  was Sudarsana. It chanced one day that he overheard a certain person  reciting these verses--        \"Wise men, holding wisdom highest, scorn delights, as false as fair,      Daily live they as Death's fingers twined already in their hair.        Truly, richer than all riches, better than the best of gain,      Wisdom is, unbought, secure--once won, none loseth her again.        Bringing dark things into daylight, solving doubts that vex the mind,      Like an open eye is Wisdom--he that hath her not is blind.\"    Hearing these the King became disquieted, knowing that his own sons were  gaining no wisdom, nor reading the Sacred Writings,[2] but altogether  going in the wrong way; and he repeated this verse to himself--        \"Childless art thou? dead thy children? leaving thee to want and dool?      Less thy misery than his is, who is father to a fool.\"    And again this--        \"One wise son makes glad his father, forty fools avail him not:--      One moon silvers all that darkness which the silly stars did dot.\"    \"And it has been said,\" reflected he--        \"Ease and health, obeisant children, wisdom, and a fair-voiced wife--      Thus, great King! are counted up the five felicities of life.      For the son the sire is honored; though the bow-cane bendeth true,      Let the strained string crack in using, and what service shall it do?\"    \"Nevertheless,\" mused the King, \"I know it is urged that human efforts  are useless: as, for instance--        \"That which will not be, will not be--and what is to be, will be:--      Why not drink this easy physic, antidote of misery?\"    \"But then that comes from idleness, with people who will not do what  they should do. Rather,        \"Nay! and faint not, idly sighing, 'Destiny is mightiest,'      Sesamum holds oil in plenty, but it yieldeth none unpressed.      Ah! it is the Coward's babble, 'Fortune taketh, Fortune gave;'      Fortune! rate her like a master, and she serves thee like a slave.\"    \"For indeed,        \"Twofold is the life we live in--Fate and Will together run:--      Two wheels bear life's chariot onward--will it move on only one?\"    \"And        \"Look! the clay dries into iron, but the potter moulds the clay:--      Destiny to-day is master--Man was master yesterday.\"    \"So verily,        \"Wo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"BEETHOVEN'S LETTERS.

We beg you to be so good as to send us two copies in score of the Symphony  in A. We likewise wish to know when we may expect a copy of the Sonata for  Baroness von Ertmann, as she leaves this, most probably, the day after  to-morrow.    No. 3--I mean the enclosed note--is from a musical friend in Silesia, not a  rich man, for whom I have frequently had my scores written out. He wishes  to have these works of Mozart in his library; as my servant, however, has  the good fortune, by the grace of God, to be one of the greatest blockheads  in the world (which is saying a good deal), I cannot make use of him for  this purpose. Be so kind therefore as to send to Herr ---- (for the  _Generalissimus_ can have no dealings with a petty tradesman), and desire  him to _write down the price of each work_ and send it to me with my two  scores in A, and also an answer to my injunction about Ertmann, as early  to-day as you can (_presto, prestissimo_!)--_nota bene_, the _finale_ to be  _a march in double-quick time_. I recommend the best execution of these  orders, so that no further obstacle may intervene to my recovery.    L. VAN BEETHOVEN,      The best _generalissimus_ for the good,    But the devil himself for the bad!      217.    TO STEINER.    The Lieutenant-General is requested to send his _Diabolum_, that I may tell  him myself my opinion of the \"Battle,\" which is _printed in the vilest  manner_. There is much to be altered.    THE G----S.      218.    TO TOBIAS HASLINGER.    MY GOOD ADJUTANT,--    Best of all little fellows! Do see again about that house, and get it for  me. I am very anxious also to procure _the treatise on education_. It is of  some importance to me to be able to compare my own opinions on this subject  with those of others, and thus still further improve them. As for our  juvenile Adjutant, I think I shall soon have hit on the right system for  his education. Your    CONTRA FA,    _Manu propria._      219.    TO THE HIGH-BORN HERR HASLINGER, HONORARY MEMBER OF THE HOeFEN GRABENS AND  PATER NOSTER GAeSSCHEN.    BEST OF ALL PRINTERS AND ENGRAVERS,--    Be kinder than kind, and throw off a hundred impressions of the  accompanying small plate.[1] I will repay you threefold and fourfold.  Farewell!    Your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: This is possibly the humorous visiting-card that Beethoven  sometimes sent to his friends, with the inscription _Wir bleiben die Alten_  (\"We are the same as ever\"), and on reversing the card, a couple of asses  stared them in the face! Frau Eyloff told me of a similar card that her  brother Schindler once got from Beethoven on a New Year's day.]      220.    TO BARONESS DOROTHEA VON ERTMANN.[1]    Feb. 23, 1817.    MY DEAR AND VALUED DOROTHEA CECILIA,--    You have no doubt often misjudged me, from my apparently forbidding manner;  much of this arose from circumstances, especially in earlier days, when my  nature was less understood than at present. You know the manifestations of  those self-elected apostles who promote their interests by means very  different from those of the true Gospel. I did not wish to be included in  that number. Receive now what has been long intended for you,[2] and may it  serve as a proof of my admiration of your artistic talent, and likewise of  yourself! My not having heard you recently at Cz---- [Czerny's] was owing  to indisposition, which at last appears to be giving"]]]
