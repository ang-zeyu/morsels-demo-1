By William Hope Hodgson    1907              _Madre Mia_    People may say thou art no longer young    And yet, to me, thy youth was yesterday,      A yesterday that seems      Still mingled with my dreams.  Ah! how the years have o'er thee flung    Their soft mantilla, grey.    And e'en to them thou art not over old;    How could'st thou be! Thy hair      Hast scarcely lost its deep old glorious dark:      Thy face is scarcely lined. No mark  Destroys its calm serenity. Like gold    Of evening light, when winds scarce stir,    The soul-light of thy face is pure as prayer.          I    The Land of Lonesomeness      Now we had been five days in the boats, and in all this time made no  discovering of land. Then upon the morning of the sixth day came there a  cry from the bo'sun, who had the command of the lifeboat, that there was  something which might be land afar upon our larboard bow; but it was very  low lying, and none could tell whether it was land or but a morning  cloud. Yet, because there was the beginning of hope within our hearts, we  pulled wearily towards it, and thus, in about an hour, discovered it to  be indeed the coast of some flat country.    Then, it might be a little after the hour of midday, we had come so close  to it that we could distinguish with ease what manner of land lay beyond  the shore, and thus we found it to be of an abominable flatness, desolate  beyond all that I could have imagined. Here and there it appeared to be  covered with clumps of queer vegetation; though whether they were small  trees or great bushes, I had no means of telling; but this I know, that  they were like unto nothing which ever I had set eyes upon before.    So much as this I gathered as we pulled slowly along the coast, seeking  an opening whereby we could pass inward to the land; but a weary time  passed or ere we came upon that which we sought. Yet, in the end, we  found it--a slimy-banked creek, which proved to be the estuary of a great  river, though we spoke of it always as a creek. Into this we entered, and  proceeded at no great pace upwards along its winding course; and as we  made forward, we scanned the low banks upon each side, perchance there  might be some spot where we could make to land; but we found none--the  banks being composed of a vile mud which gave us no encouragement to  venture rashly upon them.    Now, having taken the boat something over a mile up the great creek, we  came upon the first of that vegetation which I had chanced to notice from  the sea, and here, being within some score yards of it, we were the  better able to study it. Thus I found that it was indeed composed largely  of a sort of tree, very low and stunted, and having what might be  described as an unwholesome look about it. The branches of this tree, I  perceived to be the cause of my inability to recognize it from a bush,  until I had come close upon it; for they grew thin and smooth through all  their length, and hung towards the earth; being weighted thereto by a  single, large cabbage-like plant which seemed to sprout from the extreme  tip of each.    Presently, having passed beyond this clump of the vegetation, and the  banks of the river remaining very low, I stood me upon a thwart, by which  means I was enabled to scan the surrounding country. This I discovered,  so far as my sight could penetrate, to be pierced in all directions with  innumerable creeks and pools, some of these latter being very great of  extent; and, as I have before made mention, everywhere the country was  low set--as it might be a great plain of mud; so that it gave me a sense  of dreariness to look out upon it. It may be, all unconsciously, that my  spirit was put in awe by the extreme silence of all the country around;  for in all that waste I could see no living thing, neither bird nor  vegetable, save it be the stunted trees, which, indeed, grew in clumps  here and there over all the land, so much as I could see.    This silence, when I grew fully aware of it was the more uncanny; for my  memory told me that never before had I come upon a country which  contained so much quietness. Nothing moved across my vision--not even a  lone bird soared up against the dull sky; and, for my hearing, not so  much as the cry of a sea-bird came to me--no! nor the croak of a frog,  nor the plash of a fish. It was as though we had come upon the Country of  Silence, which some have called the Land of Lonesomeness.    Now three hours had passed whilst we ceased not to labor at the oars, and  we could no more see the sea; yet no place fit for our feet had come to  view, for everywhere the mud, grey and black, surrounded us--encompassing  us veritably by a slimy wilderness. And so we were fain to pull on, in  the hope that we might come ultimately to firm ground.    Then, a little before sundown, we halted upon our oars, and made a scant  meal from a portion of our remaining provisions; and as we ate, I could  see the sun sinking away over the wastes, and I had some slight diversion  in watching the grotesque shadows which it cast from the trees into the  water upon our larboard side; for we had come to a pause opposite a clump  of the vegetation. It was at this time, as I remember, that it was borne  in upon me afresh how very silent was the land; and that this was not due  to my imagination, I remarked that the men both in our own and in the  bo'sun's boat, seemed uneasy because of it; for none spoke save in  undertones, as though they had fear of breaking it.    And it was at this time, when I was awed by so much solitude, that there  came the first telling of life in all that wilderness. I heard it first  in the far distance, away inland--a curious, low, sobbing note it was,  and the rise and the fall of it was like to the sobbing of a lonesome  wind through a great forest. Yet was there no wind. Then, in a moment, it  had died, and the silence of the land was awesome by reason of the  contrast. And I looked about me at the men, both in the boat in which I  was and that which the bo'sun commanded; and not one was there but held  himself in a posture of listening. In this wise a minute of quietness  passed, and then one of the men gave out a laugh, born of the nervousness  which had taken him.    The bo'sun muttered to him to hush, and, in the same moment, there came  again the plaint of that wild sobbing. And abruptly it sounded away on  our right, and immediately was caught up, as it were, and echoed back  from some place beyond us afar up the creek. At that, I got me upon a  thwart, intending to take another look over the country about us; but  the banks of the creek had become higher; moreover the vegetation acted  as a screen, even had my stature and elevation enabled me to overlook  the banks.    And so, after a little while, the crying died away, and there was another  silence. Then, as we sat each one harking for what might next befall,  George, the youngest 'prentice boy, who had his seat beside me, plucked  me by the sleeve, inquiring in a troubled voice whether I had any  knowledge of that which the crying might portend; but I shook my head,  telling him that I had no knowing beyond his own; though, for his  comfort, I said that it might be the wind. Yet, at that, he shook his  head; for indeed, it was plain that it could not be by such agency, for  there was a stark calm.    Now, I had scarce made an end of my remark, when again the sad crying  was upon us. It appeared to come from far up the creek, and from far down  the creek, and from inland and the land between us and the sea. It filled  the evening air with its doleful wailing, and I remarked that there was  in it a curious sobbing, most human in its despairful crying. And so  awesome was the thing that no man of us spoke; for it seemed that we  harked to the weeping of lost souls. And then, as we waited fearfully,  the sun sank below the edge of the world, and the dusk was upon us.    And now a more extraordinary thing happened; for, as the night fell with  swift gloom, the strange wailing and crying was hushed, and another sound  stole out upon the land--a far, sullen growling. At the first, like the  crying, it came from far inland; but was caught up speedily on all sides  of us, and presently the dark was full of it. And it increased in volume,  and strange trumpetings fled across it. Then, though with slowness, it  fell away to a low, continuous growling, and in it there was that which I  can only describe as an insistent, hungry snarl. Aye! no other word of  which I have knowledge so well describes it as that--a note of _hunger_,  most awesome to the ear. And this, more than all the rest of those  incredible voicings, brought terror into my heart.    Now as I sat listening, George gripped me suddenly by the arm, declaring  in a shrill whisper that something had come among the clump of trees upon  the left-hand bank. Of the truth of this, I had immediately a proof; for  I caught the sound of a continuous rustling among them, and then a nearer  note of growling, as though a wild beast purred at my elbow. Immediately  upon this, I caught the bo'sun's voice, calling in a low tone to Josh,  the eldest 'prentice, who had the charge of our boat, to come alongside  of him; for he would have the boats together. Then got we out the oars  and laid the boats together in the midst of the creek; and so we watched  through the night, being full of fear, so that we kept our speech low;  that is, so low as would carry our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#1)"],[1,"HO, JEEVES    By    P. G. WODEHOUSE    1922              To    RAYMOND NEEDHAM, K.C.    WITH AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION          -1-      \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"may I speak frankly?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"What I have to say may wound you.\"    \"Not at all, sir.\"    \"Well, then----\"    No--wait. Hold the line a minute. I've gone off the rails.      I don't know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always  come up against when I'm telling a story is this dashed difficult problem  of where to begin it. It's a thing you don't want to go wrong over,  because one false step and you're sunk. I mean, if you fool about too  long at the start, trying to establish atmosphere, as they call it, and  all that sort of rot, you fail to grip and the customers walk out on you.    Get off the mark, on the other hand, like a scalded cat, and your public  is at a loss. It simply raises its eyebrows, and can't make out what  you're talking about.    And in opening my report of the complex case of Gussie Fink-Nottle,  Madeline Bassett, my Cousin Angela, my Aunt Dahlia, my Uncle Thomas,  young Tuppy Glossop and the cook, Anatole, with the above spot of  dialogue, I see that I have made the second of these two floaters.    I shall have to hark back a bit. And taking it for all in all and  weighing this against that, I suppose the affair may be said to have had  its inception, if inception is the word I want, with that visit of mine  to Cannes. If I hadn't gone to Cannes, I shouldn't have met the Bassett  or bought that white mess jacket, and Angela wouldn't have met her shark,  and Aunt Dahlia wouldn't have played baccarat.    Yes, most decidedly, Cannes was the _point d'appui._    Right ho, then. Let me marshal my facts.    I went to Cannes--leaving Jeeves behind, he having intimated that he did  not wish to miss Ascot--round about the beginning of June. With me  travelled my Aunt Dahlia and her daughter Angela. Tuppy Glossop, Angela's  betrothed, was to have been of the party, but at the last moment couldn't  get away. Uncle Tom, Aunt Dahlia's husband, remained at home, because he  can't stick the South of France at any price.    So there you have the layout--Aunt Dahlia, Cousin Angela and self off to  Cannes round about the beginning of June.    All pretty clear so far, what?    We stayed at Cannes about two months, and except for the fact that Aunt  Dahlia lost her shirt at baccarat and Angela nearly got inhaled by a  shark while aquaplaning, a pleasant time was had by all.    On July the twenty-fifth, looking bronzed and fit, I accompanied aunt and  child back to London. At seven p.m. on July the twenty-sixth we alighted  at Victoria. And at seven-twenty or thereabouts we parted with mutual  expressions of esteem--they to shove off in Aunt Dahlia's car to Brinkley  Court, her place in Worcestershire, where they were expecting to  entertain Tuppy in a day or two; I to go to the flat, drop my luggage,  clean up a bit, and put on the soup and fish preparatory to pushing round  to the Drones for a bite of dinner.    And it was while I was at the flat, towelling the torso after a  much-needed rinse, that Jeeves, as we chatted of this and that--picking  up the threads, as it were--suddenly brought the name of Gussie  Fink-Nottle into the conversation.    As I recall it, the dialogue ran something as follows:    SELF: Well, Jeeves, here we are, what?    JEEVES: Yes, sir.    SELF: I mean to say, home again.    JEEVES: Precisely, sir.    SELF: Seems ages since I went away.    JEEVES: Yes, sir.    SELF: Have a good time at Ascot?    JEEVES: Most agreeable, sir.    SELF: Win anything?    JEEVES: Quite a satisfactory sum, thank you, sir.    SELF: Good. Well, Jeeves, what news on the Rialto? Anybody been phoning  or calling or anything during my abs.?    JEEVES: Mr. Fink-Nottle, sir, has been a frequent caller.    I stared. Indeed, it would not be too much to say that I gaped.    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You don't mean Mr. Fink-Nottle?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"But Mr. Fink-Nottle's not in London?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, I'm blowed.\"    And I'll tell you why I was blowed. I found it scarcely possible to give  credence to his statement. This Fink-Nottle, you see, was one of those  freaks you come across from time to time during life's journey who can't  stand London. He lived year in and year out, covered with moss, in a  remote village down in Lincolnshire, never coming up even for the Eton  and Harrow match. And when I asked him once if he didn't find the time  hang a bit heavy on his hands, he said, no, because he had a pond in his  garden and studied the habits of newts.    I couldn't imagine what could have brought the chap up to the great city.  I would have been prepared to bet that as long as the supply of newts  didn't give out, nothing could have shifted him from that village of his.    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You got the name correctly? Fink-Nottle?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, it's the most extraordinary thing. It must be five years since he  was in London. He makes no secret of the fact that the place gives him  the pip. Until now, he has always stayed glued to the country, completely  surrounded by newts.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Newts, Jeeves. Mr. Fink-Nottle has a strong newt complex. You must have  heard of newts. Those little sort of lizard things that charge about in  ponds.\"    \"Oh, yes, sir. The aquatic members of the family Salamandridae which  constitute the genus Molge.\"    \"That's right. Well, Gussie has always been a slave to them. He used to  keep them at school.\"    \"I believe young gentlemen frequently do, sir.\"    \"He kept them in his study in a kind of glass-tank arrangement, and  pretty niffy the whole thing was, I recall. I suppose one ought to have  been able to see what the end would be even then, but you know what boys  are. Careless, heedless, busy about our own affairs, we scarcely gave  this kink in Gussie's character a thought. We may have exchanged an  occasional remark about it taking all sorts to make a world, but nothing  more. You can guess the sequel. The trouble spread,\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"Absolutely, Jeeves. The craving grew upon him. The newts got him.  Arrived at man's estate, he retired to the depths of the country and gave  his life up to these dumb chums. I suppose he used to tell himself that  he could take them or leave them alone, and then found--too late--that he  couldn't.\"    \"It is often the way, sir.\"    \"Too true, Jeeves. At any rate, for the last five years he has been  living at this place of his down in Lincolnshire, as confirmed a  species-shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second  day and refused to see a soul. That's why I was so amazed when you told  me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this. I still can't believe  it. I am inclined to think that there must be some mistake, and that  this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of  Fink-Nottle. The chap I know wears horn-rimmed spectacles and has a face  like a fish. How does that check up with your data?\"    \"The gentleman who came to the flat wore horn-rimmed spectacles, sir.\"    \"And looked like something on a slab?\"    \"Possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine, sir.\"    \"Then it must be Gussie, I suppose. But what on earth can have brought  him up to London?\"    \"I am in a position to explain that, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle confided to me  his motive in visiting the metropolis. He came because the young lady is  here.\"    \"Young lady?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You don't mean he's in love?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, I'm dashed. I'm really dashed. I positively am dashed, Jeeves.\"    And I was too. I mean to say, a joke's a joke, but there are limits.    Then I found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair.  Conceding the fact that Gussie Fink-Nottle, against all the ruling of the  form book, might have fallen in love, why should he have been haunting my  flat like this? No doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow  needs a friend, but I couldn't see what had made him pick on me.    It wasn't as if he and I were in any way bosom. We had seen a lot of each  other at one time, of course, but in the last two years I hadn't had so  much as a post card from him.    I put all this to Jeeves:    \"Odd, his coming to me. Still, if he did, he did. No argument about that.  It must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found I  wasn't here.\"    \"No, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle did not call to see you, sir.\"    \"Pull yourself together, Jeeves. You've just told me that this is what he  has been doing, and assiduously, at that.\"    \"It was I with whom he was desirous of establishing communication, sir.\"    \"You? But I didn't know you had ever met him.\"    \"I had not had that pleasure until he called here, sir. But it appears  that Mr. Sipperley, a fellow student with whom Mr. Fink-Nottle had been at  the university, recommended him to place his affairs in my hands.\"    The mystery had conked. I saw all. As I dare say you know, Jeeves's  reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the  cognoscenti, and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering  themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing  up to him. And when he's got A out of a bad spot, A puts B on to him. And  then, when he has fixed up B, B sends C along. And so on, if you get my  drift, and so forth.    That's how these big consulting practices like Jeeves's grow. Old Sippy,  I knew, had been deeply impressed by the man's efforts on his behalf at  the time when he was trying to get engaged to Elizabeth Moon, so it was  not to be wondered at that he should have advised Gussie to apply. Pure  routine, you might say.    \"Oh, you're acting for him, are you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Now I follow. Now I understand. And what is Gussie's trouble?\"    \"Oddly enough, sir, precisely the same as that of Mr. Sipperley when I  was enabled"]]]
