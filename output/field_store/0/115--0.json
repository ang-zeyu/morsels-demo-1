Wheatley, F.S.A.          OLD COOKERY BOOKS AND ANCIENT CUISINE    BY    W. CAREW HAZLITT    London    1902              _THE BOOK-LOVERS LIBRARY_ was first published in the following styles:    No. 1.--Printed on antique paper, in cloth bevelled with rough edges,  price 4s. 6d.

There are a few sets left, and can be had on application to the  Publisher.          INTRODUCTORY      Man has been distinguished from other animals in various ways; but  perhaps there is no particular in which he exhibits so marked a  difference from the rest of creation--not even in the prehensile  faculty resident in his hand--as in the objection to raw food, meat,  and vegetables. He approximates to his inferior contemporaries only in  the matter of fruit, salads, and oysters, not to mention wild-duck.  He entertains no sympathy with the cannibal, who judges the flavour of  his enemy improved by temporary commitment to a subterranean  larder; yet, to be sure, he keeps his grouse and his venison till it  approaches the condition of spoon-meat.    It naturally ensues, from the absence or scantiness of explicit or  systematic information connected with the opening stages of such  inquiries as the present, that the student is compelled to draw his  own inferences from indirect or unwitting allusion; but so long as  conjecture and hypothesis are not too freely indulged, this class of  evidence is, as a rule, tolerably trustworthy, and is, moreover, open  to verification.    When we pass from an examination of the state of the question as  regarded Cookery in very early times among us, before an even  more valuable art--that of Printing--was discovered, we shall find  ourselves face to face with a rich and long chronological series of  books on the Mystery, the titles and fore-fronts of which are often  not without a kind of fragrance and _gout_.    As the space allotted to me is limited, and as the sketch left by  Warner of the convivial habits and household arrangements of  the Saxons or Normans in this island, as well as of the monastic  institutions, is more copious than any which I could offer, it may be  best to refer simply to his elaborate preface. But it may be pointed  out generally that the establishment of the Norman sway not only  purged of some of their Anglo-Danish barbarism the tables of the  nobility and the higher classes, but did much to spread among the  poor a thriftier manipulation of the articles of food by a resort to  broths, messes, and hot-pots. In the poorer districts, in Normandy  as well as in Brittany, Duke William would probably find very little  alteration in the mode of preparing victuals from that which was in  use in his day, eight hundred years ago, if (like another Arthur)  he should return among his ancient compatriots; but in his adopted  country he would see that there had been a considerable revolt from  the common saucepan--not to add from the pseudo-Arthurian bag-pudding;  and that the English artisan, if he could get a rump-steak or a leg of  mutton once a week, was content to starve on the other six days.    Those who desire to be more amply informed of the domestic economy  of the ancient court, and to study the _minutiae_, into which I am  precluded from entering, can easily gratify themselves in the pages  of \"The Ordinances and Regulations for the Government of the Royal  Household,\" 1790; \"The Northumberland Household Book;\" and the  various printed volumes of \"Privy Purse Expenses\" of royal and  great personages, including \"The Household Roll of Bishop Swinfield  (1289-90).\"    The late Mr. Green, in his \"History of the English People\" (1880-3, 4  vols. 8vo), does not seem to have concerned himself about the kitchens  or gardens of the nation which he undertook to describe. Yet, what  conspicuous elements these have been in our social and domestic  progress, and what civilising factors!    To a proper and accurate appreciation of the cookery of ancient times  among ourselves, a knowledge of its condition in other more or  less neighbouring countries, and of the surrounding influences and  conditions which marked the dawn of the art in England, and its slow  transition to a luxurious excess, would be in strictness necessary;  but I am tempted to refer the reader to an admirable series of papers  which appeared on this subject in Barker's \"Domestic Architecture,\"  and were collected in 1861, under the title of \"Our English Home: its  Early History and Progress.\" In this little volume the author, who  does not give his name, has drawn together in a succinct compass the  collateral information which will help to render the following pages  more luminous and interesting. An essay might be written on the  appointments of the table only, their introduction, development, and  multiplication.    The history and antiquities of the Culinary Art among the Greeks  are handled with his usual care and skill by M.J.A. St. John in his  \"Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece,\" 1842; and in the _Biblia_  or Hebrew Scriptures we get an indirect insight into the method of  cooking from the forms of sacrifice.    The earliest legend which remains to us of Hellenic gastronomy is  associated with cannibalism. It is the story of Pelops--an episode  almost pre-Homeric, where a certain rudimentary knowledge of dressing  flesh, and even of disguising its real nature, is implied in the tale,  as it descends to us; and the next in order of times is perhaps  the familiar passage in the _Odyssey_, recounting the adventures of  Odysseus and his companions in the cave of Polyphemus. Here, again,  we are introduced to a rude society of cave-dwellers, who eat human  flesh, if not as an habitual diet, yet not only without reluctance,  but with relish and enjoyment.    The _Phagetica_ of Ennius, of which fragments remain, seems to be the  most ancient treatise of the kind in Roman literature. It is supposed  to relate an account of edible fishes; but in a complete state the  work may very well have amounted to a general Manual on the subject.  In relation even to Homer, the _Phagetica_ is comparatively modern,  following the _Odyssey_ at a distance of some six centuries; and in  the interval it is extremely likely that anthropophagy had become  rarer among the Greeks, and that if they still continued to be cooking  animals, they were relinquishing the practice of cooking one another.    Mr. Ferguson, again, has built on Athenaeus and other authorities a  highly valuable paper on \"The Formation of the Palate,\" and the late  Mr. Coote, in the forty-first volume of \"Archaeologia,\" has a second  on the \"Cuisine Bourgeoise\" of ancient Rome. These two essays, with  the \"Fairfax Inventories\" communicated to the forty-eighth volume of  the \"Archaeologia\" by Mr. Peacock, cover much of the ground which had  been scarcely traversed before by any scientific English inquirer. The  importance of an insight into the culinary economy of the Romans lies  in the obligations under which the more western nations of Europe are  to it for nearly all that they at first knew upon the subject. The  Romans, on their part, were borrowers in this, as in other, sciences  from Greece, where the arts of cookery and medicine were associated,  and were studied by physicians of the greatest eminence; and to Greece  these mysteries found their way from Oriental sources. But the school  of cookery which the Romans introduced into Britain was gradually  superseded in large measure by one more agreeable to the climate and  physical demands of the people; and the free use of animal food, which  was probably never a leading feature in the diet of the Italians as  a community, and may be treated as an incidence of imperial luxury,  proved not merely innocuous, but actually beneficial to a more  northerly race.    So little is to be collected--in the shape of direct testimony, next  to nothing--of the domestic life of the Britons--that it is only by  conjecture that one arrives at the conclusion that the original diet  of our countrymen consisted of vegetables, wild fruit, the honey of  wild bees--which is still extensively used in this country,--a coarse  sort of bread, and milk. The latter was evidently treated as a very  precious article of consumption, and its value was enhanced by the  absence of oil and the apparent want of butter. Mr. Ferguson supposes,  from some remains of newly-born calves, that our ancestors sacrificed  the young of the cow rather than submit to a loss of the milk; but it  was, on the contrary, an early superstition, and may be, on obvious  grounds, a fact, that the presence of the young increased the yield  in the mother, and that the removal of the calf was detrimental. The  Italian invaders augmented and enriched the fare, without, perhaps,  materially altering its character; and the first decided reformation  in the mode of living here was doubtless achieved by the Saxon and  Danish settlers; for those in the south, who had migrated hither  from the Low Countries, ate little flesh, and indeed, as to certain  animals, cherished, according to Caesar, religious scruples against  it.    It was to the hunting tribes, who came to us from regions even bleaker  and more exacting than our own, that the southern counties owed the  taste for venison and a call for some nourishment more sustaining than  farinaceous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: OUR CAMP ON THE SNOW MOUNTAIN  AT AN ALTITUDE OF 12,000 FEET]          CAMPS AND TRAILS IN CHINA    A NARRATIVE OF EXPLORATION, ADVENTURE, AND SPORT IN LITTLE-KNOWN CHINA    BY    ROY CHAPMAN ANDREWS, M.A.    ASSOCIATE CURATOR OF MAMMALS IN THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AND  LEADER OF THE MUSEUM'S ASIATIC ZOÖLOGICAL EXPEDITION OF 1916-1917; FELLOW  NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES; CORRESPONDING MEMBER ZOÖLOGICAL SOCIETY OF  LONDON, MEMBER OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON; AUTHOR OF 'WHALE  HUNTING WITH GUN AND CAMERA'    AND    YVETTE BORUP ANDREWS    PHOTOGRAPHER OF THE ASIATIC ZOÖLOGICAL EXPEDITION    1918          THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO PRESIDENT HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN AS AN EXPRESSION  OF GRATITUDE AND ADMIRATION      \"Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;  Let us journey to a lonely land I know.

PREFACE      The object of this book is to present a popular narrative of the Asiatic  Zoölogical Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History to China in  1916-17. Details of a purely scientific nature have been condensed, or  eliminated, and emphasis has been placed upon our experiences with the  strange natives and animals of a remote and little known region in the hope  that the book will be interesting to the general reader.    The scientific reputation of the Expedition will rest upon the technical  reports of its work which will be published in due course by the American  Museum of Natural History. To these reports we would refer those readers  who desire more complete information concerning the results of our  researches. At the time the manuscript of this volume was sent to press the  collections were still undergoing preparation and the study of the  different groups had just begun.    Although the book has been largely written by the senior author, his  collaborator has contributed six chapters marked with her initials; all the  illustrations are from her photographs and continual use has been made of  her daily journals; she has, moreover, materially assisted in reference  work and in numerous other ways.    The information concerning the relationships and distribution of the native  tribes of Yün-nan is largely drawn from the excellent reference work by  Major H.R. Davies and we have followed his spelling of Chinese names.    Parts of the book have been published as separate articles in the _American  Museum Journal, Harper's Magazine_, and _Asia_ and to the editors of the  above publications our acknowledgments are due.    That the Expedition obtained a very large and representative collection of  small mammals is owing in a great measure to the efforts of Mr. Edmund  Heller, our companion in the field. He worked tirelessly in the care and  preservation of the specimens, and the fact that they reached New York in  excellent condition is, in itself, the best testimony to the skill and  thoroughness with which they were prepared.    Our Chinese interpreter, Wu Hung-tao, contributed largely to the success of  the Expedition. His faithful and enthusiastic devotion to our interests and  his tact and resourcefulness under trying circumstances won our lasting  gratitude and affectionate regard.    The nineteen months during which we were in Asia are among  the most memorable of our lives and we wish to express our deepest  gratitude to the Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History, and  especially to President Henry Fairfield Osborn, whose enthusiastic  endorsement and loyal support made the Expedition possible. Director F.A.  Lucas, Dr. J.A. Allen and Mr. George H. Sherwood were unfailing in  furthering our interests, and to them we extend our hearty thanks.    To the following patrons, who by their generous contributions materially  assisted in the financing of the Expedition, we wish to acknowledge our  great personal indebtedness as well as that of the Museum; Mr. and Mrs.  Charles L. Bernheimer, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney M. Colgate, Messrs. George  Bowdoin, Lincoln Ellsworth, James B. Ford, Henry C. Frick, Childs Frick,  and Mrs. Adrian Hoffman Joline.    The Expedition received many courtesies while in the field from the  following gentlemen, without whose coöperation it would have been  impossible to have carried on the work successfully. Their services have  been referred to individually in subsequent parts of the book: The Director  of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs of the Province of Yün-nan; M. Georges  Chemin Dupontès, Director de l'Exploration de la Compagnie Française des  Chemins de Fer de l'Indochine et du Yün-nan, Hanoi, Tonking; M. Henry  Wilden, Consul de France, Shanghai; M. Kraemer, Consul de France, Hongkong;  Mr. Howard Page, Standard Oil Co., Yün-nan Fu; the Hon. Paul Reinsch,  Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to the Chinese Republic,  Mr. J.V.A. McMurray, First Secretary of the American Legation, Peking; Mr.  H.G. Evans, British-American Tobacco Co., Hongkong; the Rev. William Hanna,  Ta-li Fu; the Rev. A. Kok, Li-chang Fu; Ralph Grierson, Esq., Teng-yueh;  Herbert Goffe, Esq., H.B.M. Consul General, Yün-nan Fu; Messrs. C.R.  Kellogg, and H.W. Livingstone, Foochow, China; the General Passenger Agent,  Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, Hongkong; and the Rev. H.R. Caldwell,  Yenping, who has read parts of this book in manuscript and who through his  criticisms has afforded us the benefit of his long experience in China.    To Miss Agnes F. Molloy and Miss Anna Katherine Berger we wish to express  our appreciation of editorial and other assistance during the preparation  of the volume.
