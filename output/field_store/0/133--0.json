The general post-office, Dublin, was at first held in a small building  on the site of the Commercial Buildings, and was afterwards removed to a  larger house opposite the bank on College Green (since converted into  the Royal Arcade;) and on January 6, 1818, the new post-office in  Sackville-street was opened for business.    The foundation-stone of this magnificent building, which is built after  a design of Francis Johnson, Esq., was laid by his excellency Charles,  Earl of Whitworth, August 12, 1814, and the structure was completed in  the short space of three years, for the sum of 50,000l.    The front, which extends 220 feet, has a magnificent portico (80 feet  wide), of six fluted Ionic columns, 4 feet 6 inches in diameter. The  frieze of the entablature is highly enriched, and in the tympanum of the  pediment are the royal arms. On the acroteria of the pediment are three  statues by John Smyth, viz.--Mercury on the right, with his Caduceus and  purse; On the left Fidelity, with her finger on her lip, and a key in  her hand; and in the centre Hibernia, resting on her spear, and holding  her shield. The entablature, with the exception of the architrave, is  continued along the rest of the front; the frieze, however, is not  decorated over the portico. A handsome balustrade surmounts the cornice  of the building, which is 50 feet from the ground. With the exception of  the portico, which is of Portland stone, the whole is of mountain  granite. The elevation has three stories, of which the lower or basement  is rusticated, and in this respect it resembles the India House of  London, where a rusticated basement is introduced, although the portico  occupies the entire height of the structure.    Over the centre of the building is seen a cupola, containing the chimes  and bell on which the clock-hammer strikes. The bell is so loud, that it  is heard in every part of the city.    The interior is particularly remarkable for the convenience of its  arrangement, and the number of its communicating apartments. The  board-room is a very handsome apartment, furnished with two seats, which  are for the postmasters-general. Over the chimney-piece, protected by a  curtain of green silk, is a bust of Earl Whitworth, in white marble, by  John Smyth.           *       *       *       *       *          THE TOPOGRAPHER.    No. XXIV.           *       *       *       *       *      HIGH CROSS.    _A Roman Station--the Camp of Claudius--Manners, Customs, and Dialects  of the people of the District._    About two miles to the west of Little Claybrook, in the hundred of  Luthlaxton, in Leicestershire, is a place called High Cross, which,  according to some antiquarians, was the Benonce or Vennones of the  Romans. Dr. Stukely describes this station as situated at the  intersection of the two great Roman roads, \"which traverse the kingdom  obliquely, and seem to be the centre, as well as the highest ground in  England; for from hence rivers run every way. The foss road went on the  backside of an inn standing here, and so towards Bath. The ground  hereabout is very rich, and much _ebulus_ (a herb much sought after  for the cure of dropsies,) grows here. Claybrooklane has a piece of  quickset hedge left across it, betokening one side of the Foss; which  road in this place bears exactly north-east and south-west as it does  upon the moor on this side of Lincoln. In the garden before the inn  abovementioned, a tumulus was removed about the year 1720, under which  the body of a man was found upon the plain surface; as likewise hath  been under several others hereabout; and foundations of buildings have  been frequently dug up along the street here, all the way to Cleycestre,  through which went the great street-way, called Watling-street; for on  both sides of the way have been ploughed and dug up many ancient coins,  great square stones and bricks, and other rubbish, of that ancient Roman  building, not far from a beacon, standing upon the way now called High  Cross, of a cross which stood there some time, upon the meeting of  another great way.\"    At the intersection of the roads is the pedestal, &c. of a cross which  was erected here in the year 1712; on which are the two following Latin  inscriptions. On one side is--      Vicinarum provinciarum, Vervicensis scilicet et Leicestrensis,    ornamenta, proceres patritiique, auspiciis, illustrissimi Basili    Comitis de Denbeigh, hanc columnam statuendam curaverunt, in gratam    pariter et perpetuam memoriam Jani tandem a Serenissima Anna clausi    A.D. MDCCXII.    Which is thus translated,      The noblemen and gentry, ornaments of the neighbouring counties of    Warwick and Leicester, at the instances of the Right Honourable Basil    Earl of Denbeigh, have caused this pillar to be erected in grateful as    well as perpetual remembrance of Peace at last restored by her Majesty    Queen Anne, in the year of our Lord, 1712.    The inscription on the other side runs thus--      Si Veterum Romanorum vestigia quaeras, hic cernas viator. Hic enim    celeberrimae illorum viae militares sese mutuo secantes ad extremes    usque Britanniae limites procurent: hic stativa sua habuerunt Vennones;    et ad primum ad hinc lapidem castra sua ad Stratam, et ad Fossam    tumulum, Claudius quidam cohortis praefectus habuisse videtur.    Which may be thus rendered,      If, traveller, you search for the footsteps of the ancient Romans, here    you may behold them. For here their most celebrated ways, crossing one    another, extend to the utmost boundaries of Britain; here the Vennones    kept their quarters; and at the distance of one mile from hence,    Claudius, a certain commander of a cohort, seems to have had a camp,    towards the street, and towards the foss a tomb.    The ground here is so high, and the surrounding country so low and flat,  that it is said, fifty-seven churches may be seen from this spot by the  help of a glass.    The following judicious remarks on the customs, mariners, and dialects  of the common people of this district by Mr. Macauley, who published a  history of Claybrook, may be amusing to many readers.--The people here  are much attached to _wakes_; and among the farmers and cottagers these  annual festivals are celebrated with music, dancing, feasting, and much  inoffensive sport; but in the neighbouring villages the return of the  wake never fails to produce at least a week of idleness, intoxication,  and riot. These and other abuses by which those festivals are grossly  perverted, render it highly desirable to all the friends of order and  decency that they were totally suppressed. On Plow Monday is annually  displayed a set of _morice dancers_; and the custom of ringing the  curfew is still continued here, as well as the pancake bell on Shrove  Tuesday. The dialect of the common people is broad, and partakes of the  Anglo-Saxon sounds and terms. The letter _h_ comes in almost on every  occasion where it ought not, and it is frequently omitted where it ought  to come in. The words _fire_, _mire_, and such like, are pronounced as  if spelt _foire_, _moire_; and _place_, _face_, and other similar words,  as if spelt _pleace_, _feace_; and in the plural you sometimes hear  _pleacen_, _closen_, for closes, and many other words in the same style  of Saxon termination. The words _there_, and _where_, are generally  pronounced _theere_ and _wheere_; the words _mercy_, _deserve_, thus,  _marcy_, _desarve_. The following peculiarities are also observable:  _uz_, strongly aspirated for _us_; _war_ for _was_; _meed_ for _maid_;  _faither_ for _father_; _e'ery_ for _every_; _brig_ for _bridge_;  _thurrough_ for _furrow_; _hawf_ for _half_; _cart rit_ for _cart rut_;  _malefactory_ for _manufactory_; _inactions_ for _anxious_. The words  _mysen_ and _himsen_, are sometimes used for _myself_ and _himself_; the  word _shoek_ is used to denote an idle worthless vagabond; and the word  _ripe_ for one who is very profane. The following phrases are common,  \"a power of people,\" \"a hantle of money,\" \"I can't awhile as yet.\" The  words _like_ and _such_ frequently occur as expletives in conversation,  \"I won't stay here haggling all day and _such_.\" \"If you don't give me  my price _like_.\" The monosyllable _as_ is generally substituted for  _that_; \"the last time _as_ I called,\" \"I reckon _as_ I an't one,\" \"I  imagine _as_ I am not singular.\" Public characters are stigmatized by  saying, \"that they set poor lights.\" The substantive _right_ often  supplies the place of _ought_, as \"farmer A has a right to pay his tax.\"  Next ways, and clever through, are in common use, as \"I shall go clever  through Ullesthorpe.\" \"_Nigh hand_\" for probably, as he will nigh hand  call on us. _Duable_, convenient or proper: thus \"the church is not  served at _duable_ hours.\" Wives of farmers often call their husbands  \"our master,\" and the husbands call their wives _mamy_, whilst a  labourer will often distinguish his wife by calling her the \"o'man.\"  People now living remember when _Goody_ and _Dame_, _Gaffer_ and  _Gammer_, were in vogue among the peasantry of Leicestershire; but they  are now almost universally discarded and supplanted by Mr. and Mrs.  which are indiscriminately applied to all ranks, from the squire and his  lady down to Mr. and Mrs. Pauper, who flaunt in rags and drink tea twice  a day.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SONG.

From time to time I have read short stories and  magazine articles which have been published about Elizabeth Zane and  her famous exploit; but they are unreliable in some particulars,  which is owing, no doubt, to the singularly meagre details available  in histories of our western border.    For a hundred years the stories of Betty and Isaac Zane have been  familiar, oft-repeated tales in my family--tales told with that  pardonable ancestral pride which seems inherent in every one. My  grandmother loved to cluster the children round her and tell them  that when she was a little girl she had knelt at the feet of Betty  Zane, and listened to the old lady as she told of her brother's  capture by the Indian Princess, of the burning of the Fort, and of  her own race for life. I knew these stories by heart when a child.    Two years ago my mother came to me with an old note book which had  been discovered in some rubbish that had been placed in the yard to  burn. The book had probably been hidden in an old picture frame for  many years. It belonged to my great-grandfather, Col. Ebenezer Zane.  From its faded and time-worn pages I have taken the main facts of my  story. My regret is that a worthier pen than mine has not had this  wealth of material.    In this busy progressive age there are no heroes of the kind so dear  to all lovers of chivalry and romance. There are heroes, perhaps,  but they are the patient sad-faced kind, of whom few take cognizance  as they hurry onward. But cannot we all remember some one who  suffered greatly, who accomplished great deeds, who died on the  battlefield--some one around whose name lingers a halo of glory? Few  of us are so unfortunate that we cannot look backward on kith or kin  and thrill with love and reverence as we dream of an act of heroism  or martyrdom which rings down the annals of time like the melody of  the huntsman's horn, as it peals out on a frosty October morn purer  and sweeter with each succeeding note.    If to any of those who have such remembrances, as well as those who  have not, my story gives an hour of pleasure I shall be rewarded.        PROLOGUE      On June 16, 1716, Alexander Spotswood, Governor of the Colony of  Virginia, and a gallant soldier who had served under Marlborough in  the English wars, rode, at the head of a dauntless band of  cavaliers, down the quiet street of quaint old Williamsburg.    The adventurous spirits of this party of men urged them toward the  land of the setting sun, that unknown west far beyond the blue  crested mountains rising so grandly before them.    Months afterward they stood on the western range of the Great North  mountains towering above the picturesque Shenandoah Valley, and from  the summit of one of the loftiest peaks, where, until then, the foot  of a white man had never trod, they viewed the vast expanse of plain  and forest with glistening eyes. Returning to Williamsburg they told  of the wonderful richness of the newly discovered country and thus  opened the way for the venturesome pioneer who was destined to  overcome all difficulties and make a home in the western world.    But fifty years and more passed before a white man penetrated far  beyond the purple spires of those majestic mountains.    One bright morning in June, 1769, the figure of a stalwart, broad  shouldered man could have been seen standing on the wild and rugged  promontory which rears its rocky bluff high above the Ohio river, at  a point near the mouth of Wheeling Creek. He was alone save for the  companionship of a deerhound that crouched at his feet. As he leaned  on a long rifle, contemplating the glorious scene that stretched  before him, a smile flashed across his bronzed cheek, and his heart  bounded as he forecast the future of that spot. In the river below  him lay an island so round and green that it resembled a huge lily  pad floating placidly on the water. The fresh green foliage of the  trees sparkled with glittering dewdrops. Back of him rose the high  ridges, and, in front, as far as eye could reach, extended an  unbroken forest.    Beneath him to the left and across a deep ravine he saw a wide level  clearing. The few scattered and blackened tree stumps showed the  ravages made by a forest fire in the years gone by. The field was  now overgrown with hazel and laurel bushes, and intermingling with  them were the trailing arbutus, the honeysuckle, and the wild rose.  A fragrant perfume was wafted upward to him. A rushing creek  bordered one edge of the clearing. After a long quiet reach of  water, which could be seen winding back in the hills, the stream  tumbled madly over a rocky ledge, and white with foam, it hurried  onward as if impatient of long restraint, and lost its individuality  in the broad Ohio.    This solitary hunter was Colonel Ebenezer Zane. He was one of those  daring men, who, as the tide of emigration started westward, had  left his friends and family and had struck out alone into the  wilderness. Departing from his home in Eastern Virginia he had  plunged into the woods, and after many days of hunting and  exploring, he reached the then far Western Ohio valley.    The scene so impressed Colonel Zane that he concluded to found a  settlement there. Taking \"tomahawk possession\" of the locality  (which consisted of blazing a few trees with his tomahawk), he built  himself a rude shack and remained that summer on the Ohio.    In the autumn he set out for Berkeley County, Virginia, to tell his  people of the magnificent country he had discovered. The following  spring he persuaded a number of settlers, of a like spirit with  himself, to accompany him to the wilderness. Believing it unsafe to  take their families with them at once, they left them at Red Stone  on the Monongahela river, while the men, including Colonel Zane, his  brothers Silas, Andrew, Jonathan and Isaac, the Wetzels, McCollochs,  Bennets, Metzars and others, pushed on ahead.    The country through which they passed was one tangled, most  impenetrable forest; the axe of the pioneer had never sounded in  this region, where every rod of the way might harbor some unknown  danger.    These reckless bordermen knew not the meaning of fear; to all,  daring adventure was welcome, and the screech of a redskin and the  ping of a bullet were familiar sounds; to the Wetzels, McCollochs  and Jonathan Zane the hunting of Indians was the most thrilling  passion of their lives; indeed, the Wetzels, particularly, knew no  other occupation. They had attained a wonderful skill with the  rifle; long practice had rendered their senses as acute as those of  the fox. Skilled in every variety of woodcraft, with lynx eyes ever  on the alert for detecting a trail, or the curling smoke of some  camp fire, or the minutest sign of an enemy, these men stole onward  through the forest with the cautious but dogged and persistent  determination that was characteristic of the settler.    They at length climbed the commanding bluff overlooking the majestic  river, and as they gazed out on the undulating and uninterrupted  area of green, their hearts beat high with hope.    The keen axe, wielded by strong arms, soon opened the clearing and  reared stout log cabins on the river bluff. Then Ebenezer Zane and  his followers moved their families and soon the settlement began to  grow and flourish. As the little village commenced to prosper the  redmen became troublesome. Settlers were shot while plowing the  fields or gathering the harvests. Bands of hostile Indians prowled  around and made it dangerous for anyone to leave the clearing.  Frequently the first person to appear in the early morning would be  shot at by an Indian concealed in the woods.    General George Rodgers Clark, commandant of the Western Military  Department, arrived at the village in 1774. As an attack from the  savages was apprehended during the year the settlers determined to  erect a fort as a defense for the infant settlement. It was planned  by General Clark and built by the people themselves. At first they  called it Fort Fincastle, in honor of Lord Dunmore, who, at the time  of its erection, was Governor of the Colony of Virginia. In 1776 its  name was changed to Fort Henry, in honor of Patrick Henry.    For many years it remained the most famous fort on the frontier,  having withstood numberless Indian attacks and two memorable sieges,  one in 1777, which year is called the year of the \"Bloody Sevens,\"  and again in 1782. In this last siege the British Rangers under  Hamilton took part with the Indians, making the attack practically  the last battle of the Revolution.        BETTY ZANE    CHAPTER I.    The Zane family was a remarkable one in early days, and most of its  members are historical characters.    The first Zane of whom any trace can be found was a Dane of  aristocratic lineage, who was exiled from his country and came to  America with William Penn. He was prominent for several years in the  new settlement founded by Penn, and Zane street, Philadelphia, bears  his name. Being a proud and arrogant man, he soon became obnoxious  to his Quaker brethren. He therefore cut loose from them and  emigrated to Virginia, settling on the Potomac river, in what was  then known as Berkeley county. There his five sons, and one  daughter, the heroine"]]]
