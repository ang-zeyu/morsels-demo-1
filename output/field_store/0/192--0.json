In this volume the terminal phenomena of the sexual process are discussed,  before an attempt is finally made, in the concluding volume, to consider  the bearings of the psychology of sex on that part of morals which may be  called \"social hygiene.\"    Under \"Erotic Symbolism\" I include practically all the aberrations of the  sexual instinct, although some of these have seemed of sufficient  importance for separate discussion in previous volumes. It is highly  probable that many readers will consider that the name scarcely suffices  to cover manifestations so numerous and so varied. The term \"sexual  equivalents\" will seem preferable to some. While, however, it may be fully  admitted that these perversions are \"sexual equivalents\"--or at all events  equivalents of the normal sexual impulse--that term is merely a  descriptive label which tells us nothing of the phenomena. \"Sexual  Symbolism\" gives us the key to the process, the key that makes all these  perversions intelligible. In all of them--very clearly in some, as in  shoe-fetichism; more obscurely in others, as in exhibitionism--it has come  about by causes congenital, acquired, or both, that some object or class  of objects, some act or group of acts, has acquired a dynamic power over  the psycho-physical mechanism of the sexual process, deflecting it from  its normal adjustment to the whole of a beloved person of the opposite  sex. There has been a transmutation of values, and certain objects,  certain acts, have acquired an emotional value which for the normal person  they do not possess. Such objects and acts are properly, it seems to me,  termed symbols, and that term embodies the only justification that in most  cases these manifestations can legitimately claim.    \"The Mechanism of Detumescence\" brings us at last to the final climax for  which the earlier and more prolonged stage of tumescence, which has  occupied us so often in these _Studies_, is the elaborate preliminary.  \"The art of love,\" a clever woman novelist has written, \"is the art of  preparation.\" That \"preparation\" is, on the physiological side, the  production of tumescence, and all courtship is concerned in building up  tumescence. But the final conjugation of two individuals in an explosion  of detumescence, thus slowly brought about, though it is largely an  involuntary act, is still not without its psychological implications and  consequences; and it is therefore a matter for regret that so little is  yet known about it. The one physiological act in which two individuals are  lifted out of all ends that center in self and become the instrument of  those higher forces which fashion the species, can never be an act to be  slurred over as trivial or unworthy of study.    In the brief study of \"The Psychic State in Pregnancy\" we at last touch  the point at which the whole complex process of sex reaches its goal. A  woman with a child in her womb is the everlasting miracle which all the  romance of love, all the cunning devices of tumescence and detumescence,  have been invented to make manifest. The psychic state of the woman who  thus occupies the supreme position which life has to offer cannot fail to  be of exceeding interest from many points of view, and not least because  the maternal instinct is one of the elements even of love between the  sexes. But the psychology of pregnancy is full of involved problems, and  here again, as so often in the wide field we have traversed, we stand at  the threshold of a door it is not yet given us to pass.

In the previous five volumes of these _Studies_, I have dealt mainly with  the sexual impulse in relation to its object, leaving out of account the  external persons and the environmental influences which yet may powerfully  affect that impulse and its gratification. We cannot afford, however, to  pass unnoticed this relationship of the sexual impulse to third persons  and to the community at large with all its anciently established  traditions. We have to consider sex in relation to society.    In so doing, it will be possible to discuss more summarily than in  preceding volumes the manifold and important problems that are presented  to us. In considering the more special questions of sexual psychology we  entered a neglected field and it was necessary to expend an analytic care  and precision which at many points had never been expended before on these  questions. But when we reach the relationships of sex to society we have  for the most part no such neglect to encounter. The subject of every  chapter in the present volume could easily form, and often has formed, the  topic of a volume, and the literature of many of these subjects is already  extremely voluminous. It must therefore be our main object here not to  accumulate details but to place each subject by turn, as clearly and  succinctly as may be, in relation to those fundamental principles of  sexual psychology which--so far as the data at present admit--have been  set forth in the preceding volumes.    It may seem to some, indeed, that in this exposition I should have  confined myself to the present, and not included so wide a sweep of the  course of human history and the traditions of the race. It may especially  seem that I have laid too great a stress on the influence of Christianity  in moulding sexual ideals and establishing sexual institutions. That, I am  convinced, is an error. It is because it is so frequently made that the  movements of progress among us--movements that can never at any period of  social history cease--are by many so seriously misunderstood. We cannot  escape from our traditions. There never has been, and never can be, any  \"age of reason.\" The most ardent co-called \"free-thinker,\" who casts aside  as he imagines the authority of the Christian past, is still held by that  past. If its traditions are not absolutely in his blood, they are  ingrained in the texture of all the social institutions into which he was  born and they affect even his modes of thinking. The latest modifications  of our institutions are inevitably influenced by the past form of those  institutions. We cannot realize where we are, nor whither we are moving,  unless we know whence we came. We cannot understand the significance of  the changes around us, nor face them with cheerful confidence, unless we  are acquainted with the drift of the great movements that stir all  civilization in never-ending cycles.    In discussing sexual questions which are very largely matters of social  hygiene we shall thus still be preserving the psychological point of view.  Such a point of view in relation to these matters is not only legitimate  but necessary. Discussions of social hygiene that are purely medical or  purely juridical or purely moral or purely theological not only lead to  conclusions that are often entirely opposed to each other but they  obviously fail to possess complete applicability to the complex human  personality. The main task before us must be to ascertain what best  expresses, and what best satisfies, the totality of the impulses and ideas  of civilized men and women. So that while we must constantly bear in mind  medical, legal, and moral demands--which all correspond in some respects  to some individual or social need--the main thing is to satisfy the  demands of the whole human person.    It is necessary to emphasize this point of view because it would seem  that no error is more common among writers on the hygienic and moral  problems of sex than the neglect of the psychological standpoint. They may  take, for instance, the side of sexual restraint, or the side of sexual  unrestraint, but they fail to realize that so narrow a basis is inadequate  for the needs of complex human beings. From the wider psychological  standpoint we recognize that we have to conciliate opposing impulses that  are both alike founded on the human psychic organism.    In the preceding volumes of these _Studies_ I have sought to refrain from  the expression of any personal opinion and to maintain, so far as  possible, a strictly objective attitude. In this endeavor, I trust, I have  been successful if I may judge from the fact that I have received the  sympathy and approval of all kinds of people, not less of the  rationalistic free-thinker than of the orthodox believer, of those who  accept, as well as of those who reject, our most current standards of  morality. This is as it should be, for whatever our criteria of the worth  of feelings and of conduct, it must always be of use to us to know what  exactly are the feelings of people and how those feelings tend to affect  their conduct. In the present volume, however, where social traditions  necessarily come in for consideration and where we have to discuss the  growth of those traditions in the past and their probable evolution in the  future, I am not sanguine that the objectivity of my attitude will be  equally clear to the reader. I have here to set down not only what people  actually feel and do but what I think they are tending to feel and do.  That is a matter of estimation only, however widely and however cautiously  it is approached; it cannot be a matter of absolute demonstration. I trust  that those who have followed me in the past will bear with me still, even  if it is impossible for them always to accept the conclusions I have  myself reached.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.
