RUSKIN HOUSE, 40 MUSEUM STREET, W.C.          PREFACE      The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar  approaches the task of translating the _Agamemnon_ depends directly on its  greatness as poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of  Aeschylus is an extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the  vocabulary obscure, unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its  peculiarities cannot be disregarded, or the translation will be false in  character. Yet not Milton himself could produce in English the same great  music, and a translator who should strive ambitiously to represent the  complex effect of the original would clog his own powers of expression and  strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the diction in this  narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding the  _Agamemnon_ which seems almost to defy reproduction in another setting,  because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the  historical development of Greek literature.    If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a  very special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to  Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the _Agamemnon_ seems to  stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near  perfection. The drama has come fully to life, but the religion has not yet  faded to a formality. The _Agamemnon_ is not, like Aeschylus' _Suppliant  Women_, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play, showing  clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological  depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its  atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one  feels that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer's wish to thrill an  audience, not even perhaps the pure artist's wish to create beauty, but  something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and  expression of truth; though of course the truth in question is something  felt rather than stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and  majestic rhythm like the movement of the stars.    Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as \"the ring, or  resonance, of greatness of soul,\" one sees in part where the sublimity of  the _Agamemnon_ comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which  some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion.  For the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and  utterly refuses to tolerate others. The _Agamemnon_ may be slow in getting  to work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to  being cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never  ceases to be genuinely a \"criticism of life.\" The theme which it treats,  for instance, is a great theme in its own right; it is not a made-up story  ingeniously handled.    The trilogy of the _Oresteia_, of which this play is the first part,  centres on the old and everlastingly unsolved problem of      The ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that amendeth wrong.    Every wrong is justly punished; yet, as the world goes, every punishment  becomes a new wrong, calling for fresh vengeance. And more; every wrong  turns out to be itself rooted in some wrong of old. It is never  gratuitous, never untempted by the working of Peitho (Persuasion), never  merely wicked. The _Oresteia_ first shows the cycle of crime punished by  crime which must be repunished, and then seeks for some gleam of escape,  some breaking of the endless chain of \"evil duty.\" In the old order of  earth and heaven there was no such escape. Each blow called for the return  blow and must do so _ad infinitum_. But, according to Aeschylus, there is  a new Ruler now in heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and  thereby grown wise. He is Zeus the Third Power, Zeus the Saviour, and his  gift to mankind is the ability through suffering to Learn (pp. 7 f.)    At the opening of the _Agamemnon_ we find Clytemnestra alienated from her  husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, Aigisthos. The  air is heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due  cause. Agamemnon, obeying the prophet Calchas, when the fleet lay  storm-bound at Aulis, had given his own daughter, Iphigenia, as a human  sacrifice. And if we ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we  are told of his gradual temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient  superstition; and above all, the fact that he had already inwardly  accepted the great whole of which this horror was a part. At the first  outset of his expedition against Troy there had appeared an omen, the  bloody sign of two eagles devouring a mother-hare with her unborn  young.... The question was thus put to the Kings and their prophet: Did  they or did they not accept the sign, and wish to be those Eagles? And  they had answered Yes. They would have their vengeance, their full and  extreme victory, and were ready to pay the price. The sign once accepted,  the prophet recoils from the consequences which, in prophetic vision, he  sees following therefrom: but the decision has been taken, and the long  tale of cruelty rolls on, culminating in the triumphant sack of Troy,  which itself becomes not an assertion of Justice but a whirlwind of  godless destruction. And through all these doings of fierce beasts and  angry men the unseen Pity has been alive and watching, the Artemis who  \"abhors the Eagles' feast,\" the \"Apollo or Pan or Zeus\" who hears the  crying of the robbed vulture; nay, if even the Gods were deaf, the mere  \"wrong of the dead\" at Troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon  the \"Slayer of Many Men\" (pp. 15, 20).    If we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through  incessant evil, Aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the  infection of old sin, old cruelty. There is no doubt somewhere a  _[Greek: protarchos hAte ]_, a \"first blind deed of wrong,\" but in  practice every wrong is the result of another. And the Children of Atreus  are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her  first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some  definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of  two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs.  From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the  House--more than its \"Luck,\" a little less than its Guardian  Angel--becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a \"Red Slayer\" which cries  ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind  way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance  (p. 69).    This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly  groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it  were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by  Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know  not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be  recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee  and foretell the truth, none should believe her. The Cassandra scene is a  creation beyond praise or criticism. The old scholiast speaks of the \"pity  and amazement\" which it causes. The Elders who talk with her wish to  believe, they try to understand, they are really convinced of Cassandra's  powers. But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra  tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no  finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they  are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams  wandering in the daylight.\"    The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme  and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further  significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the  incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of  sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16).  Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol  of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or  specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations  of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66  ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of  names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei],  \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Aga_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is  more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too  much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all  things that are in excess. _Aga_ is sometimes called \"the jealousy of  God,\" but such a translation is not happy. It is not the jealousy, nor  even the indignation, of a personal God, but the profound repudiation and  reversal of Hubris which is the very law of the Cosmos. Through all the  triumph of the conqueror, this _Aga_ abides.    The greatest and most human character of the whole play is Clytemnestra.  She is conceived on the grand Aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even  Lady Macbeth and Beatrice Cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of  Brynhild. Yet she is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology.  She is the first and leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the  tragic stage, the sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal.  Aeschylus employs none of the devices of later playwrights to make her  interesting."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14419"],[0,"Grammatical Sketch of the Heve Language (#1)"],[1,"Team            Transcriber's Note: The symbol \"[=o]\" is  used to represent an \"o\" with macron.

This tongue was spoken in the middle of the last century over a  region of country principally within Sonora, the northernmost of  the seven Provinces then comprising the kingdom of New Galicia  under the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The limit of Sonora on the east  was continuous along the chain of mountains that divides it from  Taraumara,--from Sateche, the farthest of the Indian settlements in  that district, southwardly eighty leagues to Bacoa Sati the first of  its towns. On the west the Province was washed by the sea of Cortez  from the mouth of the Hiaqui to the Tomosatzi, or Colorado, the waters  of the Hiaqui forming its limit to the south; and on the north by a  course from the Mission of Baseraca westwardly through the Presidio  de Fronteras to that of Pitic (Terrenate), a distance of seventy  leagues. According to the opinion of a Jesuit Father, the author of  an anonymous work in, manuscript on that country, written in the year  1762 at Alamo, it was thought also to be the most important among  the many Provinces of Mexico, whether for fertility of soil, gold  washings, or silver mines; and not less distinguishable for the  docility and loyalty of those aboriginal inhabitants who had  early given their adhesion to the government to secure religious  instruction.    [Footnote 1: The title of the work, in manuscript, from which the  grammatical notices have been elaborated is Arte y Vocabulario de  la lingua Dohema, Heve ó Eudeva; the adjective termination of the  last and first name being evidently Spanish, as is also the plural  terminations used elsewhere in some of the modifications of those  words. We have only the definition of Heve with certainty given as  \"people;\" to the word \"nation\" in the vocabulary, there being attached  the remark: \"I find no generic term: each (nation) has its specific  name; the Eudeves are called Dóhme.\" Another like work, also  unpublished, with the title _Arte cíe In lengua Pinea_ has the  dictionary inscribed _Vocabulario en lengua Nevome_.    In the uncertain relationship of the tribes to each other, better  marked and measured perhaps by the proximity of their idioms than by  any other means with which we are acquainted, a thought has been taken  from the indistinct manner in which these different people are spoken  of by those who have been among them to advance in the present title,  (since we may not be at liberty to reject,) the word Dóhme for the  family; and Pima generally for the common language, under which the  Opata, Heve, Nevome, Sobahipurls and the rest may be placed, as they  shall become known, each by its separate dialect.]    The Missions of Sonora included moreover a section to the south  bounded by the River Chico within the Province of Ostimuri. To the  north, within the religious precinct, was the Pimeria Alta through the  Sobahipuris up to the junction of the river of that name, (otherwise  the San Pedro,) with the Gila; thence for a distance of more than  one hundred and thirty leagues, after passing among _rancherías_ of  Pima, Opa, and Cocomaricopa, and having received in its course the  Asumpcion, or Compuesto--from its being formed by the united waters  of two streams, the Salado and Verde--it enters the Tomosatzi, closing  that Pimeria of innumerable tribes described by the missionaries as  sealed in productive places, and in a genial climate. Other Indians of  the same names, the Yuma also and Papapootam (Papago) lived beyond,  as appears from the accounts given by the spiritual invaders of those  remote regions, chiefly the Fathers Kino, Keller, and Sedelmayer.    The two principal nations of Sonora are spoken of as the Opata and  Tima, since the Eudeve should be reckoned with the Opata, for the  reason that its language differs as little from that of the other as  the Portuguese from the Castilian, or the Provençal from the French;  and likewise should also be added the Jove, who, having mingled with  the Opata, no longer use their own tongue, except in some instances of  the aged. It is one difficult to acquire, and different from any other  in the Province.    The Opata are the best of the native Christians, having never turned  upon their teachers, nor once risen against the royal authorities; nor  do they, like other Indians, make the women bear the heavier share of  the labor in the fields. They are industrious husbandmen; but they are  not any the less wanting in valor on that account, having oftentimes  shown their good conduct when bearing arms with the king's forces  at the expense of the Missions. Individuals there were, and perhaps  still are, who did the work of blacksmiths, carpenters, tailors, stone  cutters, masons, learning any craft readily, and practicing it with  skill. They and some of the Endeve, although in a less degree, are to  the other Indians what the people who live in towns are to those in  the country, still for all it was remarked, they were none the less  Indians. Such was the general character of the Opata, which is the  same that is given of them in our time by that curious and instructive  observer, John R. Bartlett, in his narrative of an expedition into  that country.    The Jove were a rural people, quite the greater number of them,  unwilling to be brought together in communities, lived in chasms  among the ridges where they were born, proof to the solicitations of  kindness and conveniences of civilized life. The other portion of them  dwelt in Ponida, Teopari and Mochoba. The good missionary at Bacadeque  endeavored to bring into towns those who inhabited the ranchería  of Sathechi and the margins of the Mulatos and Arcos, rivers to the  south, without avail. They live among briars, owning a few animals,  subsisting on wild fruits and vegetables, gathering an occasional  stalk of maize or a pumpkin that nature suffers to grow in some  crevice here and there made by torrents bursting from the mountains.    These nations, the Pima and the Opata, Eudeve, Jove, forming two  people, occupy the greater portion of Sonora, seated far inward to  the west from the Cordillera. The limit on the south is where stood  the deserted town of Ivatora thence to Arivetze, Bacanora, Tonitzi,  Soyopa, Nacori; on the west from Alamos, through parts of Ures and  Nacomeri to Opedepe, and Cucurpe; on the north from Arispe, Chinapa,  Bacoquetzi, Cuquiaratzi to Babispe, and from that Mission of Babispe  on the east by mountains of low elevation returning to Natora.    The Pima occupy a still wider territory, extending on the south into  Cinaloa, on the east in to the Province of Taraumara. The Upper Pima  are found far to the north living by the Sobahipuris to its outlet,  and on both banks of the Gila to the Tomosatzi, in vales of luxuriant  beauty, and in wastes of sand and sterility between those rivers  and the sea,--having still other tribes beyond them using the same  language in different dialects. The Lower Pima are in the west of  the Province, having many towns extending to the frontier of the  indomitable Seri, who live some thirty leagues to the north of the  mouth of the Hiaqui and have their farthest limit inland, some dozen  leagues from the sea, finding shelter among the ridges, and in the  neighboring island of Tiburon.[2] Those of the Pima who reside on  the south, in the Province of Cinaloa, the history of their migration  thither is of the earliest, and belongs to that which should relate  the closing scene in the journey of Cabeza de Vaca, with the strange  success that eventually, at the close of a century, attended his  Christian purpose.    [Footnote 2: The Guaima speak nearly the same language as the Seri,  are few in number, and live among the Hiaqui in Belén and elsewhere,  having retreated before the sanguinary fury of their congeners    _MS._]    All these nations, save the last, and all others who inhabit the  country excepting the Apaches--including a numerous people on the Gila  and on the farther bank of the Colorado--speak the same language, with  so slight differences, say the missionaries, that they who shall have  attained the one of the Opata and Eudeve with little difficulty will  master the rest. And for this we have that early authority referred  to, of three centuries since: \"They made known to us what they would  say by means of a language they have among them through which we and  they understood each other. Those to whom it properly belongs we call  Primahaitu, which is equivalent to when we say Biscayans. We found  it in use over more than four hundred leagues (miles?) of our travel,  without another in the whole extent.\" The name thus given by the  narrator of the Naufragios seemingly exists in these words, their  definitions taken from a dictionary in MS. of the Pima language  written by a missionary. No, _pima_: Nothing, _pim' haitu_. Ques.  What, _Ai_? Ans. _Pimahaitu_ (nihil).          GRAMMAR OF THE HEVE LANGUAGE.           *       *       *       *       *      PART I.    ORTHOGRAPHY.
