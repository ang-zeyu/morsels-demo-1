Frost  Tampa, Florida  October 20, 1937    JOSEPHINE ANDERSON      HANTS    \"I kaint tell nothin bout slavery times cept what I heared folks talk  about. I was too young to remember much but I recleck seein my granma  milk de cows an do de washin. Granpa was old, an dey let him do light  work, mosly fish an hunt.    \"I doan member nothin bout my daddy. He died when I was a baby. My  stepfather was Stephen Anderson, an my mammy's name was Dorcas. He come  fum Vajinny, but my mammy was borned an raised in Wilmington. My name  was Josephine Anderson fore I married Willie Jones. I had two  half-brothers youngern me, John Henry an Ed, an a half-sister, Elsie. De  boys had to mind de calves an sheeps, an Elsie nursed de missus' baby. I  done de cookin, mosly, an helped my mammy spin.    \"I was ony five year old when dey brung me to Sanderson, in Baker  County, Florida. My stepfather went to work for a turpentine man, makin  barrels, an he work at dat job till he drop dead in de camp. I reckon he  musta had heart disease.    \"I doan recleck ever seein my mammy wear shoes. Even in de winter she go  barefoot, an I reckon cold didn't hurt her feet no moran her hands an  face. We all wore dresses made o' homespun. De thread was spun an de  cloth wove right in our own home. My mamy an granmamy an me done it in  spare time.    \"My weddin dress was blue--blue for true. I thought it was de prettiest  dress I ever see. We was married in de court-house, an dat be a mighty  happy day for me. Mos folks dem days got married by layin a broom on de  floor an jumpin over it. Dat seals de marriage, an at de same time  brings em good luck.    \"Ya see brooms keeps hants away. When mean folks dies, de old debbil  sometimes doan want em down dere in da bad place, so he makes witches  out of em, an sends em back. One thing bout witches, dey gotta count  everthing fore dey can git acrosst it. You put a broom acrosst your door  at night an old witches gotta count ever straw in dat broom fore she can  come in.    \"Some folks can jes nachly see hants bettern others. Teeny, my gal can.  I reckon das cause she been borned wid a veil--you know, a caul, sumpum  what be over some babies' faces when dey is borned. Folks borned wid a  caul can see sperrits, an tell whas gonna happen fore it comes true.    \"Use to worry Teeny right smart, seein sperrits day an night. My husban  say he gonna cure her, so he taken a grain o' corn an put it in a bottle  in Teeny's bedroom over night. Den he planted it in de yard, an driv  plenty sticks roun da place. When it was growin good, he put leaf-mold  roun de stalk, an watch it ever day, an tell us don't _nobody_ touch de  stalk. It raise three big ears o' corn, an when dey was good roastin  size he pick em off an cook em an tell Teeny eat ever grain offn all  three cobs. He watch her while she done it, an she ain never been  worried wid hants no more. She sees em jes the same, but dey doan bother  her none.    \"Fust time I ever knowed a hant to come into our quarters was when I was  jes big nough to go out to parties. De game what we use to play was spin  de plate. Ever time I think on dat game it gives me de shivers. One time  there was a strange young man come to a party where I was. Said he name  Richard Green, an he been takin keer o' horses for a rich man what was  gonna buy a plantation in dat county. He look kinda slick an  dressed-up--diffunt from de rest. All de gals begin to cast sheep's eyes  at him, an hope he gonna choose dem when day start playin games.    \"Pretty soon dey begin to play spin de plate an it come my turn fust  thing. I spin it an call out 'Mister Green!' He jumps to de middle o' de  ring to grab de plate an 'Bang'--bout four guns go off all at oncet, an  Mister Green fall to de floor plum dead shot through de head.    \"Fore we knowed who done it, de sheriff an some more men jump down from  de loft, where dey bean hidin an tell us quit hollerin an doan be  scairt. Dis man be a bad deeper--you know, one o' them outlaws what  kills folks. He some kinda foreigner, an jes tryin make blieve he a  niggah, so's they don't find him.    \"Wall we didn't feel like playin no more games, an f'ever after dat you  coundn't git no niggahs to pass dat house alone atter dark. Dey say da  place was hanted, an if you look through de winder any dark night you  could see a man in dere spinnin de plate.    \"I sho didn't never look in, cause I done seen more hants aready dan I  ever wants to see agin. One night I was goin to my granny's house. It  was jes comin dark, an when I got to de crick an start across on de  foot-log, dere on de other end o' dat log was a man wid his haid cut off  an layin plum over on his shoulder. He look at me, kinda pitiful, an  don't say a word--but I closely never waited to see what he gonna talk  about. I pure flew back home. I was so scairt I couldn't tell de folks  what done happened till I set down an get my breath.    \"Nother time, not so long ago, when I live down in Gary, I be walkin  down de railroad track soon in de mornin an fore I knowed it, dere was a  white man walkin long side o' me. I jes thought it were somebody, but I  wadn't sho, so I turn off at de fust street to git way from dere. De nex  mawnin I be boin[TR: goin?] to work at de same time. It were kinda foggy  an dark, so I never seen nobody till I mighty nigh run into dis same  man, an dere he goes, bout half a step ahead o' me, his two hands restin  on his be-hind.    \"I was so close up to him I could see him plain as I see you. He had  fingernails dat long, all cleaned an polished. He was tull, an had on a  derby hat, an stylish black clothes. When I walk slow he slow down, an  when I stop, he stop, never oncet lookin roun. My feets make a noise on  de cinders tween de rails, but he doan make a mite o' noise. Dat was de  fust thing got me scairt, but I figger I better find out for sho ifen he  be a sperrit; so I say, gook an loud: 'Lookee here, Mister, I jez an old  colored woman, an I knows my place, an I wisht you wouldn't walk wid me  counta what folks might say.'    \"He never looked roun no moren if I wan't there, an I cut my eyes roun  to see if there is somebody I can holler to for help. When I looked back  he was gone; gone, like dat, without makin a sound. Den I knowed he be a  hant, an de nex day when I tell somebody bout it dey say he be de genman  what got killed at de crossin a spell back, an other folks has seen him  jus like I did. Dey say dey can hear babies cryin at de trestle right  near dere, an ain't nobody yit ever found em.    \"Dat ain de ony hant I ever seen. One day I go out to de smokehouse to  git a mess o' taters. It was after sundown, but still purty light. When  I gits dere de door be unlocked an a big man standin half inside. 'What  you doin stealin our taters!' I hollers at him, an pow! He gone, jes  like dat. Did I git back to dat house! We mighty glad to eat grits an  cornbread dat night.    \"When we livin at Titusville, I see my old mammy comin up de road jus as  plain as day. I stan on de porch, fixin to run an meet her, when all of  a sudden she be gone. I begin to cry an tell de folks I ain't gonna see  my mammy agin. An sho nuff, I never did. She die at Sanderson, back in  West Florida, fore I got to see her.    \"Does I blieve in witches? S-a-a-y, I knows more bout em den to jes  'blieve'--I been _rid_ by em. Right here in dis house. You ain never  been rid by a witch? Well, you mighty lucky. Dey come in de night,  ginnerly soon after you drop off to sleep. Dey put a bridle on your  head, an a bit in your mouth, an a saddle on your back. Den dey take off  their skin an hang it up on de wall. Den dey git on you an some nights  dey like to ride you to death. You try to holler but you kaint, counta  the iron bit in your mouth, an you feel like somebody holdin you down.  Den dey ride you back home an into your bed.

Cloth, $1.25 net.      TO THE STAFF OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS LABORATORY, AT MADISON,  WISCONSIN IN APPRECIATION OF THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED AND  COURTESIES EXTENDED THE AUTHOR          PREFACE        This book was written primarily for students of forestry to whom  a knowledge of the technical properties of wood is essential.  The mechanics involved is reduced to the simplest terms and  without reference to higher mathematics, with which the students  rarely are familiar. The intention throughout has been to avoid  all unnecessarily technical language and descriptions, thereby  making the subject-matter readily available to every one  interested in wood.    Part I is devoted to a discussion of the mechanical properties  of wood--the relation of wood material to stresses and strains.  Much of the subject-matter is merely elementary mechanics of  materials in general, though written with reference to wood in  particular. Numerous tables are included, showing the various  strength values of many of the more important American woods.    Part II deals with the factors affecting the mechanical  properties of wood. This is a subject of interest to all who are  concerned in the rational use of wood, and to the forester it  also, by retrospection, suggests ways and means of regulating  his forest product through control of the conditions of  production. Attempt has been made, in the light of all data at  hand, to answer many moot questions, such as the effect on the  quality of wood of rate of growth, season of cutting, heartwood  and sapwood, locality of growth, weight, water content,  steaming, and defects.    Part III describes methods of timber testing. They are for the  most part those followed by the U.S. Forest Service. In schools  equipped with the necessary machinery the instructions will  serve to direct the tests; in others a study of the text with  reference to the illustrations should give an adequate  conception of the methods employed in this most important line  of research.    The appendix contains a copy of the working plan followed by the  U.S. Forest Service in the extensive investigations covering the  mechanical properties of the woods grown in the United States.  It contains many valuable suggestions for the independent  investigator. In addition four tables of strength values for  structural timbers, both green and air-seasoned, are included.  The relation of the stresses developed in different structural  forms to those developed in the small clear specimens is given.    In the bibliography attempt was made to list all of the  important publications and articles on the mechanical properties  of wood, and timber testing. While admittedly incomplete, it  should prove of assistance to the student who desires a fuller  knowledge of the subject than is presented here.    The writer is indebted to the U.S. Forest Service for nearly all  of his tables and photographs as well as many of the data upon  which the book is based, since only the Government is able to  conduct the extensive investigations essential to a thorough  understanding of the subject. More than eighty thousand tests  have been made at the Madison laboratory alone, and the work is  far from completion.    The writer also acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. Emanuel  Fritz, M.E., M.F., for many helpful suggestions in the  preparation of Part I; and especially to Mr. Harry Donald  Tiemann, M.E., M.F., engineer in charge of Timber Physics at the  Government Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, for  careful revision of the entire manuscript.
