A magnificent work[1] upon this subject has just been completed in  Paris, where it was commenced fifteen years ago. It was begun under  the auspices of M. Paul Delaroche and M.C. Lenormand, member of the  Institute, and well known already as one of the first authorities in  the numismatic branch of archaeology. Some faint idea of the greatness  of the task may be given by stating that it embraces the whole range  of art, from the regal coins of Syracuse and of the Ptolemies, down to  those of our day; that such a stupendous scheme should ever have been  carried into execution is not solely due to the admirable ease and  fidelity, with which the \"Collas machine\" renders the smallest and the  largest gems of the antique: but to him who first felt, appreciated,  and afterward promoted its capabilities in this labor of love, M.A.  Lachevardiere. Comparisons and contrasts, which are the life of art,  though generally confined to the mental vision, are not the least of  the recommendations of this vast work. For the first time have the  minor treasures of each country been brought together, and not the  least conspicuous portion are those from the British Museum and the  Bank of England.    [Footnote 1: Tresor de Numismatique et de Glyptique; ou, Recueil  General de Medailles, Monnaies, Pierres Gravees, Sceaux, Bas-reliefs,  Ornements, &c. Paris, 1850.]    Whether we consider the selection of these monumental relics, the  explanatory letterpress, or the engravings which reproduce them, we  are struck by the admirable taste, science, and fidelity with which  the largest as well as the smallest gems have each and every one been  made to tally in size with the originals.    The collection of the \"Tresor de Numismatique et Glyptique,\"  consisting of twenty volumes in folio, and containing a thousand  engraved plates in folio, reproduces upward of 15,000 specimens, and  is divided into three classes--1st. The coins, medals, cameos, &c.  of antiquity; 2d. Those of the middle ages; lastly, those of modern  times. The details of this immense mass of artistic wealth would be  endless; but these three classes seem to be arranged according to the  latest classification of numismatists.    In the first class may be noticed--1. The regal coins of Greece,  which contains, beside the portraits of the Greek Kings, to be found  in Visconti's \"Iconographie,\" copied from medals and engraved gems,  all the coins bearing the Greek name of either a king, a prince, or  a tyrant, and every variety of these types, whether they bear the  effigy of a prince, or only reproduce his name. To the medals of each  sovereign are joined the most authentic and celebrated engraved gems  of European cabinets. Next come the series of portraits of the Roman  emperors and their families, with all the important varieties of Roman  numismatics, amongst which will be found the most celebrated coins  of France, Vienna, Dresden, Munich, Florence, Naples, St. Petersburg,  Weimar, &c.; and, moreover, those medallions which perpetuate great  events. These two volumes contain eight-fold more matter than the  great work of Visconti.    In the second class, containing the works of the middle ages, and  showing the uninterrupted progress of the numismatic art down to  modern times, and forming alone fourteen volumes, we find the source  which the French artists and men of letters have studied with such  predilection. First in order are the Italian medals of the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries, chiefly by the famous Victor Pisano, a  Veronese, whom Nasari has so much lauded. The scholars and imitators  of Pisano also produced works as interesting as historical documents  as they are admirable in workmanship. Here also will be found the  French and English seals, in which the balance of skill in design and  execution is acknowledged to be in our favor.    Less barbarous, and indeed perfect works of art, in character of  costume and visage, are the medals struck in Germany during the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the influence of Albert  Durer and his school was strongly felt. And finally, relics of  ornamental art of different nations and epochs.    In the third class, two parts only are devoted to contemporary art;  the medals illustrative of the French revolution of 1789; those of  the \"Empire\" and of the Emperor \"Napoleon;\" generally smacking of the  florid and corrupt taste of that period, they are nevertheless curious  as being often the sole evidence of the facts commemorated. There is,  however, a manifest improvement in the late ones, and in them may be  traced the transition from the independent ideas of the revolution  to the subsequent submission to one man: and not less striking is  the transition from a slip-shod style of art to a pedantic imitation  of the antique. The \"Tresor de Numismatique et de Glyptique\" is the  most scientific and important work of art which has been executed and  achieved of late years in France. Our great public libraries may be  proud of possessing so rich, so valuable, and so curious a collection,    Most lovers of art have their favorite periods and well-beloved  masters, but in this varied range of excellence it is difficult which  to select for preference and admiration. The cameos have a beauty and  _finesse_ which far surpass that of busts and statues; they evince the  skill of grouping, which, with rare exceptions, such as the Niobe and  Laocoon, is seldom aimed at in the more important pieces of sculpture.  Cameos, moreover, let us, as it were, into the secrets of indoor  life. To these considerations we may add that these gems have had an  immense influence on French modern art. The \"Apotheosis of Augustus\"  especially, known to antiquarians as the \"Agate of Tiberius,\" the  largest cameo in the world, and beautifully engraved the size of the  original in this collection, may be traced in more than one of their  late compositions.    It is said that large medallions are a sign of taste either in the  medalist or the monarch he is supposed to honor; if so, Dupre and  Varin have drawn a thick vail over the effulgence of Louis XIV.  We would not, however, lose their wigs and smiles for a world of  historiettes.    But it is to be remembered that the more names are blazoned on works  of art, the more art becomes deteriorated. In this respect the present  collection shows the rapidly progressive march of this evil through  twenty-five centuries--a most instructive subject of contemplation.           *       *       *       *       *      THE CSIKOS OF HUNGARY.    Of the chivalry, the gallantry, the splendor, the hospitality, the  courage, and the love of liberty of the Hungarian noble or gentleman,  no one doubts. Of his ideas of true constitutional freedom, or the  zeal with which that or Hungarian independence has been maintained  first through Turkish, and then German domination for some hundred  years past, doubts may be entertained. Neither do the Hungarian  peasantry or people reflect high credit on their \"natural superiors.\"  Something should be deducted for the forced vivacity and straining  after effect of the litterateur; but this sketch of a large class of  peasantry from Max Schlesinger's \"War in Hungary,\" just published  in London, must have some foundation in truth--and very like the Red  Indians or half-breeds of Spanish America the people look.    \"The Csikos is a man who from his birth, somehow or other, finds  himself seated upon a foal. Instinctively the boy remains fixed upon  the animal's back, and grows up in his seat as other children do in  the cradle.    \"The boy grows by degrees to a big horse-herd. To earn his livelihood,  he enters the service of some nobleman, or of the Government, who  possess in Hungary immense herds of wild horses. These herds range  over a tract of many German square miles, for the most part some level  plain, with wood, marsh, heath, and moorland; they rove about where  they please, multiply, and enjoy freedom of existence. Nevertheless,  it is a common error to imagine that these horses, like a pack of  wolves in the mountains, are left to themselves and nature, without  any care or thought of man. Wild horses, in the proper sense of the  term, are in Europe at the present day only met with in Bessarabia;  whereas the so-called wild herds in Hungary may rather be compared  to the animals ranging in our large parks, which are attended to and  watched. The deer are left to the illusion that they enjoy the most  unbounded freedom; and the deer-stalker, when in pursuit of his game,  readily gives in to the same illusion. Or, to take another simile, the  reader has only to picture to himself a well-constituted free state,  whether a republic or a monarchy is all one.    \"The Csikos has the difficult task of keeping a watchful eye upon  these herds. He knows their strength, their habits, the spots they  frequent; he knows the birthday of every foal, and when the animal,  fit for training, should be taken out of the herd. He has then a hard  task upon his hands, compared with which a Grand-Ducal wild-boar hunt  is child's play; for the horse has not only to be taken alive from the  midst of the herd, but of course safe and sound in wind and limb. For  this purpose, the celebrated whip of the Csikos serves him; probably  at some future time a few splendid specimens of this instrument will  be exhibited in the Imperial Arsenal at Vienna, beside the sword of  Scanderberg and the Swiss 'morning-stars.'    \"This whip has a stout handle from one and a half to two feet long,  and a cord which measures not less than from eighteen to twenty-four  feet in length. The cord is attached to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#1)"],[1,"OF WONDER    by Lord Dunsany            A Tale of London    Thirteen at Table    The City on Mallington Moor    Why the Milkman Shudders When He Perceives the Dawn    The Bad Old Woman in Black    The Bird of the Difficult Eye    The Long Porter's Tale    The Loot of Loma    The Secret of the Sea    How Ali Came to the Black Country    The Bureau d'Echange de Maux    A Story of Land and Sea      Guarantee To The Reader      A Tale of the Equator    A Narrow Escape    The Watch-tower    How Plash-Goo Came to the Land of None's Desire    The Three Sailors' Gambit    The Exiles Club    The Three Infernal Jokes          Preface                                                       Ebrington Barracks                                                          Aug. 16th 1916.    I do not know where I may be when this preface is read. As I write it  in August 1916, I am at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, recovering  from a slight wound. But it does not greatly matter where I am; my  dreams are here before you amongst the following pages; and writing in  a day when life is cheap, dreams seem to me all the dearer, the only  things that survive.    Just now the civilization of Europe seems almost to have ceased, and  nothing seems to grow in her torn fields but death, yet this is only  for a while and dreams will come back again and bloom as of old, all  the more radiantly for this terrible ploughing, as the flowers will  bloom again where the trenches are and the primroses shelter in  shell-holes for many seasons, when weeping Liberty has come home to  Flanders.    To some of you in America this may seem an unnecessary and wasteful  quarrel, as other people's quarrels often are; but it comes to this  that though we are all killed there will be songs again, but if we  were to submit and so survive there could be neither songs nor dreams,  nor any joyous free things any more.    And do not regret the lives that are wasted amongst us, or the work  that the dead would have done, for war is no accident that man's care  could have averted, but is as natural, though not as regular, as the  tides; as well regret the things that the tide has washed away, which  destroys and cleanses and crumbles, and spares the minutest shells.    And now I will write nothing further about our war, but offer you  these books of dreams from Europe as one throws things of value, if  only to oneself, at the last moment out of a burning house.                                                                 DUNSANY.            A Tale of London    \"Come,\" said the Sultan to his hasheesh-eater in the very furthest  lands that know Bagdad, \"dream to me now of London.\"    And the hasheesh-eater made a low obeisance and seated himself  cross-legged upon a purple cushion broidered with golden poppies, on  the floor, beside an ivory bowl where the hasheesh was, and having  eaten liberally of the hasheesh blinked seven times and spoke thus:    \"O Friend of God, know then that London is the desiderate town even of  all Earth's cities. Its houses are of ebony and cedar which they roof  with thin copper plates that the hand of Time turns green. They have  golden balconies in which amethysts are where they sit and watch the  sunset. Musicians in the gloaming steal softly along the ways; unheard  their feet fall on the white sea-sand with which those ways are  strewn, and in the darkness suddenly they play on dulcimers and  instruments with strings. Then are there murmurs in the balconies  praising their skill, then are there bracelets cast down to them for  reward and golden necklaces and even pearls.    \"Indeed but the city is fair; there is by the sandy ways a paving all  alabaster, and the lanterns along it are of chrysoprase, all night  long they shine green, but of amethyst are the lanterns of the  balconies.    \"As the musicians go along the ways dancers gather about them and  dance upon the alabaster pavings, for joy and not for hire. Sometimes  a window opens far up in an ebony palace and a wreath is cast down to  a dancer or orchids showered upon them.    \"Indeed of many cities have I dreamt but of none fairer, through many  marble metropolitan gates hasheesh has led me, but London is its  secret, the last gate of all; the ivory bowl has nothing more to show.  And indeed even now the imps that crawl behind me and that will not  let me be are plucking me by the elbow and bidding my spirit return,  for well they know that I have seen too much. 'No, not London,' they  say; and therefore I will speak of some other city, a city of some  less mysterious land, and anger not the imps with forbidden things. I  will speak of Persepolis or famous Thebes.\"    A shade of annoyance crossed the Sultan's face, a look of thunder that  you had scarcely seen, but in those lands they watched his visage  well, and though his spirit was wandering far away and his eyes were  bleared with hasheesh yet that storyteller there and then perceived  the look that was death, and sent his spirit back at once to London as  a man runs into his house when the thunder comes.    \"And therefore,\" he continued, \"in the desiderate city, in London, all  their camels are pure white. Remarkable is the swiftness of their  horses, that draw their chariots that are of ivory along those sandy  ways and that are of surpassing lightness, they have little bells of  silver upon their horses' heads. O Friend of God, if you perceived  their merchants! The glory of their dresses in the noonday! They are  no less gorgeous than those butterflies that float about their  streets. They have overcloaks of green and vestments of azure, huge  purple flowers blaze on their overcloaks, the work of cunning needles,  the centres of the flowers are of gold and the petals of purple. All  their hats are black--\" (\"No, no,\" said the Sultan)--\"but irises are  set about the brims, and green plumes float above the crowns of them.    \"They have a river that is named the Thames, on it their ships go up  with violet sails bringing incense for the braziers that perfume the  streets, new songs exchanged for gold with alien tribes, raw silver  for the statues of their heroes, gold to make balconies where the  women sit, great sapphires to reward their poets with, the secrets of  old cities and strange lands, the earning of the dwellers in far  isles, emeralds, diamonds, and the hoards of the sea. And whenever a  ship comes into port and furls its violet sails and the news spreads  through London that she has come, then all the merchants go down to  the river to barter, and all day long the chariots whirl through the  streets, and the sound of their going is a mighty roar all day until  evening, their roar is even like--\"    \"Not so,\" said the Sultan.    \"Truth is not hidden from the Friend of God,\" replied the  hasheesh-eater, \"I have erred being drunken with the hasheesh, for in  the desiderate city, even in London, so thick upon the ways is the  white sea-sand with which the city glimmers that no sound comes from  the path of the charioteers, but they go softly like a light  sea-wind.\" (\"It is well,\" said the Sultan.) \"They go softly down to  the port where the vessels are, and the merchandise in from the sea,  amongst the wonders that the sailors show, on land by the high ships,  and softly they go though swiftly at evening back to their homes.    \"O would that the Munificent, the Illustrious, the Friend of God, had  even seen these things, had seen the jewellers with their empty  baskets, bargaining there by the ships, when the barrels of emeralds  came up from the hold. Or would that he had seen the fountains there  in silver basins in the midst of the ways. I have seen small spires  upon their ebony houses and the spires were all of gold, birds  strutted there upon the copper roofs from golden spire to spire that  have no equal for splendour in all the woods of the world. And over  London the desiderate city the sky is so deep a blue that by this  alone the traveller may know where he has come, and may end his  fortunate journey. Nor yet for any colour of the sky is there too  great heat in London, for along its ways a wind blows always from the  South gently and cools the city.    \"Such, O Friend of God, is indeed the city of London, lying very far  off on the yonder side of Bagdad, without a peer for beauty or  excellence of its ways among the towns of the earth or cities of song;  and even so, as I have told, its fortunate citizens dwell, with their  hearts ever devising beautiful things and from the beauty of their own  fair work that is more abundant around them every year, receiving new  inspirations to work things more beautiful yet.\"    \"And is their government good?\" the Sultan said.    \"It is most good,\" said the hasheesh-eater, and fell backwards upon  the floor.    He lay thus and was silent. And when the Sultan perceived he would  speak no more that night he smiled and lightly applauded.    And there was envy in that palace, in lands beyond Bagdad, of all that  dwell in London.            Thirteen at Table    In front of a spacious fireplace of the old kind, when the logs were  well alight, and men with pipes and glasses were gathered before it in  great easeful chairs, and the wild weather outside and the comfort  that was within, and the season of the year--for it was Christmas--and  the hour of the night, all called for the weird or uncanny, then out  spoke the ex-master of foxhounds and told this tale.    I once had an odd experience too. It was when I had the Bromley and  Sydenham, the year I gave them up--as a matter of fact it was the last  day of the season. It was no use going on because there were no foxes  left in the county, and London was sweeping down on us. You could see  it from the kennels all along the skyline like a terrible army in  grey, and masses of villas every year came skirmishing down our  valleys. Our coverts were mostly on the hills, and as the town came  down upon the valleys "]]]
