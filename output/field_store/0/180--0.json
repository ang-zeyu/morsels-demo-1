The old maxim, that \"Knowledge is power,\" is a true one, but there  is still a greater truth: \"KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\" Safety amid physical  ills that beset mankind, and safety amid the moral pitfalls that  surround so many young people, is the great crying demand of the age.    2. CRITICISM.--This work, though plain and to some extent startling,  is chaste, practical and to the point, and will be a boon and a  blessing to thousands who consult its pages. The world is full of  ignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise, because they live  to suffer ills, for they know no better. New light is fast falling  upon the dark corners, and the eyes of many are being opened.    3. RESEARCHES OF SCIENCE.--The researches of science in the past few  years have thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology  of man and woman, and the diseases to which they are subject, and  consequently many reformations have taken place in the treatment and  prevention of diseases peculiar to the sexes.    4. LOCK AND KEY.--Any information bearing upon the diseases of mankind  should not be kept under lock and key. The physician is frequently  called upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some  private and startling disease contracted on account of ignorance. The  better plan, however, is to so educate and enlighten old and young  upon the important subjects of health, so that the necessity to call a  physician may occur less frequently.    5. PROGRESSION.--A large, respectable, though diminishing class in  every community, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to  either sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction.  But such an opinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the  mother of purity than it is of religion.

CHESTERTON                PREFACE    This book is only an uncomfortably large note-book; and it has  the disadvantages, whether or no it has the advantages, of notes that were  taken on the spot.  Owing to the unexpected distraction of other duties,  the notes were published in a newspaper as they were made on the spot;  and are now reproduced in a book as they were published in the newspaper.  The only exception refers to the last chapter on Zionism; and even  there the book only reverts to the original note-book. A difference  of opinion, which divided the writer of the book from the politics  of the newspaper, prevented the complete publication of that chapter  in that place.  I recognise that any expurgated form of it would  have falsified the proportions of my attempt to do justice in a very  difficult problem; but on re-reading even my own attempt in extenso,  I am far from satisfied that the proper proportions are kept.  I wrote these first impressions in Palestine, where everybody  recognises the Jew as something quite distinct from the Englishman  or the European; and where his unpopularity even moved me in the  direction of his defence.  But I admit it was something of a shock  to return to a conventional atmosphere, in which that unpopularity  is still actually denied or described as mere persecution.  It was more of a shock to realise that this most obscurantist of all types  of obscurantism is still sometimes regarded as a sort of liberalism.  To talk of the Jews always as the oppressed and never as the  oppressors is simply absurd; it is as if men pleaded for reasonable  help for exiled French aristocrats or ruined Irish landlords,  and forgot that the French and Irish peasants had any wrongs at all.  Moreover, the Jews in the West do not seem so much concerned to ask,  as I have done however tentatively here, whether a larger and less  local colonial development might really transfer the bulk of Israel  to a more independent basis, as simply to demand that Jews shall  continue to control other nations as well as their own.  It might be  worth while for England to take risks to settle the Jewish problem;  but not to take risks merely to unsettle the Arab problem,  and leave the Jewish problem unsolved.    For the rest, there must under the circumstances be only too  many mistakes; the historical conjectures, for they can be no more,  are founded on authorities sufficiently recognised for me to be permitted  to trust them; but I have never pretended to the knowledge necessary  to check them.  I am aware that there are many disputed points;  as for instance the connection of Gerard, the fiery Templar,  with the English town of Bideford.  I am also aware that some are  sensitive about the spelling of words; and the very proof-readers  will sometimes revolt and turn Mahomet into Mohammed.  Upon this point, however, I am unrepentant; for I never could see  the point of altering a form with historic and even heroic fame in our  own language, for the sake of reproducing by an arrangement of our  letters something that is really written in quite different letters,  and probably pronounced with quite a different accent.  In speaking  of the great prophet I am therefore resolved to call him Mahomet;  and am prepared, on further provocation, to call him Mahound.    G. K. C.

For it is often necessary to walk backwards, as a man  on the wrong road goes back to a sign-post to find the right road.  The modern man is more like a traveller who has forgotten the name  of his destination, and has to go back whence he came, even to find out  where he is going.  That the world has lost its way few will now deny;  and it did seem to me that I found at last a sort of sign-post,  of a singular and significant shape, and saw for a moment in my mind  the true map of the modern wanderings; but whether I shall be able  to say anything of what I saw, this story must show.    I had said farewell to all my friends, or all those with my own limited  number of legs; and nothing living remained but a dog and a donkey.  The reader will learn with surprise that my first feeling of fellowship  went out to the dog; I am well aware that I lay open my guard to a lunge  of wit.  The dog is rather like a donkey, or a small caricature of one,  with a large black head and long black ears; but in the mood of the  moment there was rather a moral contrast than a pictorial parallel.  For the dog did indeed seem to stand for home and everything I was  leaving behind me, with reluctance, especially that season of the year.  For one thing, he is named after Mr. Winkle, the Christmas guest  of Mr. Wardle; and there is indeed something Dickensian in his union  of domesticity with exuberance.  He jumped about me, barking like  a small battery, under the impression that I was going for a walk;  but I could not, alas, take him with me on a stroll to Palestine.  Incidentally, he would have been out of place; for dogs have not  their due honour in the East; and this seemed to sharpen my sense  of my own domestic sentinel as a sort of symbol of the West.  On the other hand, the East is full of donkeys, often very  dignified donkeys; and when I turned my attention to the other  grotesque quadruped, with an even larger head and even longer ears,  he seemed to take on a deep shade of oriental mystery.  I know not why these two absurd creatures tangled themselves up  so much in my train of thought, like dragons in an illuminated text;  or ramped like gargoyles on either side of the gateway of my adventure.  But in truth they were in some sense symbols of the West and the East  after all.  The dog's very lawlessness is but an extravagance  of loyalty; he will go mad with joy three times on the same day,  at going out for a walk down the same road.  The modern world  is full of fantastic forms of animal worship; a religion generally  accompanied with human sacrifice.  Yet we hear strangely little of  the real merits of animals; and one of them surely is this innocence  of all boredom; perhaps such simplicity is the absence of sin.  I have some sense myself of the sacred duty of surprise;  and the need of seeing the old road as a new road.  But I cannot  claim that whenever I go out for a walk with my family and friends,  I rush in front of them volleying vociferous shouts of happiness;  or even leap up round them attempting to lick their faces.  It is in this  power of beginning again with energy upon familiar and homely things  that the dog is really the eternal type of the Western civilisation.  And the donkey is really as different as is the Eastern civilisation.  His very anarchy is a sort of secrecy; his very revolt is a secret.  He does not leap up because he wishes to share my walk,  but to follow his own way, as lonely as the wild ass of Scripture.  My own beast of burden supports the authority of Scripture  by being a very wild ass.  I have given him the name of Trotsky,  because he seldom trots, but either scampers or stands still.  He scampers all over the field when it is necessary to catch him,  and stands still when it is really urgent to drive him.  He also breaks fences, eats vegetables, and fulfills other functions;  between delays and destructions he could ruin a really poor man  in a day.  I wish this fact were more often remembered, in judging  whether really poor men have really been cruel to donkeys.  But I assure the reader that I am not cruel to my donkey; the cruelty  is all the other way.  He kicks the people who try to catch him;  and again I am haunted by a dim human parallel.  For it seems to me  that many of us, in just detestation of the dirty trick of cruelty  to animals, have really a great deal of patience with animals;  more patience, I fear, than many of us have with human beings.  Suppose I had to go out and catch my secretary in a field  every morning; and suppose my secretary always kicked me by way  of beginning the day's work; I wonder whether that day's work  would resume its normal course as if nothing had happened.  Nothing graver than these grotesque images and groping speculations  would come into my conscious mind just then, though at the back  of it there was an indescribable sense of regret and parting.  All through my wanderings the dog remained in my memory as a  Dickensian and domestic emblem of England; and if it is difficult  to take a donkey seriously, it ought to be easiest, at least,  for a man who is going to Jerusalem.    There was a cloud of Christmas weather on the great grey beech-woods  and the silver cross of the cross-roads. For the four roads that meet  in the market-place of my little town make one of the largest and  simplest of such outlines on the map of England; and the shape as it  shines on that wooded chart always affects me in a singular fashion.  The sight of the cross-roads is in a true sense the sign of the cross.  For it is the sign of a truly Christian thing; that sharp combination  of liberty and limitation which we call choice.  A man is entirely  free to choose between right and left, or between right and wrong.  As"]]]
