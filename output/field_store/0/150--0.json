MITCHELL, F.G.S. & M.R.G.S.    SURVEYOR-GENERAL.        SECOND EDITION, CAREFULLY REVISED.    ...    IN TWO VOLUMES.    VOLUME 1.      LONDON:  T. & W. BOONE, NEW BOND STREET.      ...      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.    The following Journals were written at the close of many a laborious day,  when the energies both of mind and body were almost exhausted by  long-continued toil. The author trusts that this circumstance will  account for, and palliate, some of the defects which may be discovered in  his volumes. Conscious as he is of the deficiencies of his work, he  nevertheless hopes that the reader will not pronounce it to be wholly  devoid of interest. Though Australia calls up no historical  recollections, no classical associations of ideas, it has other, and not  less valid titles to our attention. It is a new and vast country, over  the largest portion of which a veil of mystery still hangs; many of its  productions vary in a singular manner, from those in other parts of the  world; within the memory of man one British colony has risen there, in  spite of adverse circumstances, to a high degree of prosperity; others  have been founded, which promise to be equally successful; and it seems  impossible to doubt that, at no distant period, the whole territory will  be inhabited by a powerful people, speaking the English language,  diffusing around them English civilisation and arts, and exercising a  predominant influence over eastern Asia, and the numerous and extensive  islands in that quarter of the globe.    In his expeditions into the interior of Australia, the author was led  cheerfully on, by an eager curiosity to examine a country which is yet in  the same state as when it was formed by its Maker. With respect to the  narrative of those expeditions, the sole merit which he claims is that of  having faithfully described what he attentively observed; neither his  pencil nor his pen has been allowed to pass the bounds of truth. There is  however one branch of his subject on which justice and gratitude render  it necessary for him to say something more. In those departments of  natural history, to which he owns himself a stranger, he has received  assistance of the utmost value from several distinguished persons. To the  few plants which, after his unfortunate fellow traveller had sacrificed  his life to the pursuit, the writer was able to collect, a permanent  place in the botanic system has been given by Dr. Lindley. Much  importance has been added to the work, by the researches and discoveries  which Professor Owen has made, with regard to the fossil remains; and the  few particulars gleaned relative to existing animals have enabled Mr.  Ogilby to introduce several interesting novelties to the attention of  zoologists. To these gentlemen, and also to Professor Faraday, Mr.  MacLeay, and other scientific friends, the warmest acknowledgments of the  writer are due, for whatever naturalists may deem worthy of praise in  these pages.    The aid thus liberally afforded, acting in unison with a feeling that, as  the surveys were undertaken by order of Government, it is his duty to lay  the result of them early before the public, has encouraged the author to  persevere steadily in bringing out these volumes; though he must candidly  own that, but for these considerations, he would rather have delayed the  performance of this task till he had completed another,* of a national  character, which, connected as it is with the days of his early service  in the cause of his country, may naturally be supposed to have stronger  and more attractive claims upon him.

London,  20 May 1814.    PREFACE.    The publication in 1814 of a voyage commenced in 1801, and of which all  the essential parts were concluded within three years, requires some  explanation. Shipwreck and a long imprisonment prevented my arrival in  England until the latter end of 1810; much had then been done to forward  the account, and the charts in particular were nearly prepared for the  engraver; but it was desirable that the astronomical observations, upon  which so much depended, should undergo a re-calculation, and the lunar  distances have the advantage of being compared with the observations made  at the same time at Greenwich; and in July 1811, the necessary authority  was obtained from the Board of Longitude. A considerable delay hence  arose, and it was prolonged by the Greenwich observations being found to  differ so much from the calculated places of the sun and moon, given in  the Nautical Almanacks of 1801, 2 and 3, as to make considerable  alterations in the longitudes of places settled during the voyage; and a  reconstruction of all the charts becoming thence indispensable to  accuracy, I wished also to employ in it corrections of another kind,  which before had been adopted only in some particular instances.    A variety of observations with the compass had shown the magnetic needle  to differ from itself sometimes as much as six, and even seven degrees,  in or very near the same place, and the differences appeared to be  subject to regular laws; but it was so extraordinary in the present  advanced state of navigation, that they should not have been before  discovered and a mode of preventing or correcting them ascertained, that  my deductions, and almost the facts were distrusted; and in the first  construction of the charts I had feared to deviate much from the usual  practice. Application was now made to the Admiralty for experiments to be  tried with the compass on board different ships; and the results in five  cases being conformable to one of the three laws before deduced, which  alone was susceptible of proof in England, the whole were adopted without  reserve, and the variations and bearings taken throughout the voyage  underwent a systematic correction. From these causes the reconstruction  of the charts could not be commenced before 1813, which, when the extent  of them is considered, will explain why the publication did not take  place sooner; but it is hoped that the advantage in point of accuracy  will amply compensate the delay.    Besides correcting the lunar distances and the variations and bearings,  there are some other particulars, both in the account of the voyage and  in the Atlas, where the practice of former navigators has not been  strictly followed. Latitudes, longitudes, and bearings, so important to  the seaman and _un_interesting to the general reader, have hitherto been  interwoven in the text; they are here commonly separated from it, by  which the one will be enabled to find them more readily, and the other  perceive at a glance what may be passed. I heard it declared that a man  who published a quarto volume without an index ought to be set in the  pillory, and being unwilling to incur the full rigour of this sentence, a  running title has been affixed to all the pages; on one side is expressed  the country or coast, and on the opposite the particular part where the  ship is at anchor or which is the immediate subject of examination; this,  it is hoped, will answer the main purpose of an index, without swelling  the volumes. Longitude is one of the most essential, but at the same time  least certain _data_ in hydrography; the man of science therefore  requires something more than the general result of observations before  giving his unqualified assent to their accuracy, and the progress of  knowledge has of late been such, that a commander now wishes to know the  foundation upon which he is to rest his confidence and the safety of his  ship; to comply with this laudable desire, the particular results of the  observations by which the most important points on each coast are fixed  in longitude, as also the means used to obtain them, are given at the end  of the volume wherein that coast is described., as being there of most  easy reference.    The deviations in the Atlas from former practice, or rather the  additional marks used, are intended to make the charts contain as full a  journal of the voyage as can be conveyed in this form; a chart is the  seaman's great, and often sole guide, and if the information in it can be  rendered more complete without introducing confusion, the advantage will  be admitted by those who are not opposers of all improvement. In closely  following a track laid down upon a chart, seamen often run at night,  unsuspicious of danger if none be marked; but some parts of that track  were run in the night also, and there may consequently be rocks or  shoals, as near even as half a mile, which might prove fatal to them; it  therefore seems proper that night tracks should be distinguished from  those of the day, and they are so in this Atlas, I believe, for the first  time. A distinction is made between the situations at noon where the  latitude was observed, and those in which none could be obtained; and the  positions fixed in longitude by the time keepers are also marked in the  track, as are the few points where a latitude was obtained from the moon.    It has appeared to me, that to show the direction and strength of the  winds, with the kind of weather we had when running along these coasts,  would be an useful addition to the charts; not only as it would enable  those who may navigate by them alone to form a judgment of what is to be  expected at the same season, but also that it may be seen how far  circumstances prevented several parts of the coast being laid down so  correctly as others. This has been done by single arrows, wherever they  could be marked without confusion; they are more or less feathered,  proportionate to the strength of wind intended to be expressed, and the  arrows themselves give the direction. Under each is a short or abridged  word, denoting the weather; when this weather prevailed in a more than  usual degree a line is drawn under the word, and when in an excessive  degree there are two lines. Single arrows being thus appropriated to the  winds, the tides and currents are shown by double arrows, between which  is usually marked the rate per hour.    On the land, the shading of the hills gives a general idea of their  elevation, and it has been assisted by saying how far particular hills  and capes are visible from a ship's deck in fine weather; this will be  useful to a seaman on first making the land, be a better criterion to  judge of its height, and those hills not so marked may be more nearly  estimated by comparison. Behind different parts of the coast is given a  short description of their appearance, which it is conceived will be  gratifying to scientific, and useful to professional men. The capes and  hills whose positions are fixed by cross bearings taken on shore or from  well ascertained points in the track, as also the stations whence  bearings were observed with a theodolite, have distinguishing marks;  which, with all others not"]]]
