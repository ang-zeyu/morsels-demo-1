Brinkley, Ark.  Age: 73      \"I was born in Chickashaw County, Mississippi. Ely Abbott and Maggie  Abbott was our owners. They had three girls and two boys--Eddie and  Johnny. We played together till I was grown. I loved em like if they was  brothers. Papa and Mos Ely went to war together in a two-horse top  buggy. They both come back when they got through.    \"There was eight of us children and none was sold, none give way. My  parents name Peter and Mahaley Abbott. My father never was sold but my  mother was sold into this Abbott family for a house girl. She cooked and  washed and ironed. No'm, she wasn't a wet nurse, but she tended to Eddie  and Johnny and me all alike. She whoop them when they needed, and Miss  Maggie whoop me. That the way we grow'd up. Mos Ely was 'ceptionly good  I recken. No'm, I never heard of him drinkin' whiskey. They made cider  and 'simmon beer every year.    \"Grandpa was a soldier in the war. He fought in a battle. I don't know  the battle. He wasn't hurt. He come home and told us how awful it was.    \"My parents stayed on at Mos Ely's and my uncle's family stayed on. He  give my uncle a home and twenty acres of ground and my parents same  mount to run a gin. I drove two mules, my brother drove two and we drove  two more between us and run the gin. My auntie seen somebody go in the  gin one night but didn't think bout them settin' it on fire. They had a  torch, I recken, in there. All I knowed, it burned up and Mos Ely had to  take our land back and sell it to pay for four or five hundred bales of  cotton got burned up that time. We stayed on and sharecropped with him.  We lived between Egypt and Okolona, Mississippi. Aberdeen was our  tradin' point.    \"I come to Arkansas railroading. I railroaded forty years. Worked on the  section, then I belong to the extra gang. I help build this railroad to  Memphis.    \"I did own a home but I got in debt and had to sell it and let my money  go.    \"Times is so changed and the young folks different. They won't work only  nough to get by and they want you to give em all you got. They take it  if they can. Nobody got time to work. I think times is worse than they  ever been, cause folks hate to work so bad. I'm talking bout hard work,  field work. Jobs young folks want is scarce; jobs they could get they  don't want. They want to run about and fool around an get by.    \"I get $8.00 and provisions from the government.\"          Interviewer: Watt McKinney  Person interviewed: Lucian Abernathy, Marvell, Arkansas  Age: 85      \"I was borned in de 'streme norf part of Mississippi nigh de Tennessee  line.

Kegan Paul,  Trench, Truebner & Co. an elementary work on the Egyptian language,  entitled \"First Steps in Egyptian,\" and two years later the companion  volume, \"An Egyptian Reading Book,\" with transliterations of all the  texts printed in it, and a full vocabulary. The success of these works  proved that they had helped to satisfy a want long felt by students of  the Egyptian language, and as a similar want existed among students of  the languages written in the cuneiform character, Mr. L.W. King, of the  British Museum, prepared, on the same lines as the two books mentioned  above, an elementary work on the Assyrian and Babylonian languages  (\"First Steps in Assyrian\"), which appeared in 1898. These works,  however, dealt mainly with the philological branch of Egyptology and  Assyriology, and it was impossible in the space allowed to explain much  that needed explanation in the other branches of those subjects--that is  to say, matters relating to the archaeology, history, religion, etc., of  the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians. In answer to the numerous  requests which have been made, a series of short, popular handbooks on  the most important branches of Egyptology and Assyriology have been  prepared, and it is hoped that these will serve as introductions to the  larger works on these subjects. The present is the first volume of the  series, and the succeeding volumes will be published at short intervals,  and at moderate prices.                            EGYPTIAN IDEAS                        OF THE                     FUTURE LIFE                          BY       E.A. WALLIS BUDGE, M. A., LITT. D., D. LIT.

C. B., D. C. L., F. R. S., ETC., ETC., ETC. IN  GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF MUCH FRIENDLY HELP AND ENCOURAGEMENT          PREFACE.       *    *    *    *    *    The following pages are intended to place before the reader in a handy  form an account of the principal ideas and beliefs held by the ancient  Egyptians concerning the resurrection and the future life, which is  derived wholly from native religious works. The literature of Egypt  which deals with these subjects is large and, as was to be expected, the  product of different periods which, taken together, cover several  thousands of years; and it is exceedingly difficult at times to  reconcile the statements and beliefs of a writer of one period with  those of a writer of another. Up to the present no systematic account of  the doctrine of the resurrection and of the future life has been  discovered, and there is no reason for hoping that such a thing will  ever be found, for the Egyptians do not appear to have thought that it  was necessary to write a work of the kind. The inherent difficulty of  the subject, and the natural impossibility that different men living in  different places and at different times should think alike on matters  which must, after all, belong always to the region of faith, render it  more than probable that no college of priests, however powerful, was  able to formulate a system of beliefs which would be received throughout  Egypt by the clergy and the laity alike, and would be copied by the  scribes as a final and authoritative work on Egyptian eschatology.  Besides this, the genius and structure of the Egyptian language are such  as to preclude the possibility of composing in it works of a  philosophical or metaphysical character in the true sense of the words.  In spite of these difficulties, however, it is possible to collect a  great deal of important information on the subject from the funereal and  religious works which have come down to us, especially concerning the  great central idea of immortality, which existed unchanged for thousands  of years, and formed the pivot upon which the religious and social life  of the ancient Egyptians actually turned. From the beginning to the end  of his life the Egyptian's chief thought was of the life beyond the  grave, and the hewing of his tomb in the rock, and the providing of its  furniture, every detail of which was prescribed by the custom of the  country, absorbed the best thoughts of his mind and a large share of his  worldly goods, and kept him ever mindful of the time when his mummified  body would be borne to his \"everlasting house\" in the limestone plateau  or hill.    The chief source of our information concerning the doctrine of the  resurrection and of the future life as held by the Egyptians is, of  course, the great collection of religious texts generally known by the  name of \"Book of the Dead.\" The various recensions of these wonderful  compositions cover a period of more than five thousand years, and they  reflect faithfully not only the sublime beliefs, and the high ideals,  and the noble aspirations of the educated Egyptians, but also the  various superstitions and childish reverence for amulets, and magical  rites, and charms, which they probably inherited from their pre-dynastic  ancestors, and regarded as essentials for their salvation. It must be  distinctly understood that many passages and allusions in the Book of  the Dead still remain obscure, and that in some places any translator  will be at a difficulty in attempting to render certain, important words  into any modern European language. But it is absurd to talk of almost  the whole text of the Book of the Dead as being utterly corrupt, for  royal personages, and priests, and scribes, to say nothing of the  ordinary educated folk, would not have caused costly copies of a very  lengthy work to be multiplied, and illustrated by artists possessing the  highest skill, unless it had some meaning to them, and was necessary for  the attainment by them of the life which is beyond the grave. The  \"finds\" of recent years in Egypt have resulted in the recovery of  valuable texts whereby numerous difficulties have been cleared away; and  we must hope that the faults made in translating to-day may be corrected  by the discoveries of to-morrow. In spite of all difficulties, both  textual and grammatical, sufficient is now known of the Egyptian  religion to prove, with certainty, that the Egyptians possessed, some  six thousand years ago, a religion and a system of morality which, when  stripped of all corrupt accretions, stand second to none among those  which have been developed by the greatest nations of the world.

THE BELIEF IN GOD ALMIGHTY.    A study of ancient Egyptian religious texts will convince the reader  that the Egyptians believed in One God, who was self-existent, immortal,  invisible, eternal, omniscient, almighty, and inscrutable; the maker of  the heavens, earth, and underworld; the creator of the sky and the sea,  men and women, animals and birds, fish and creeping things, trees and  plants, and the incorporeal beings who were the messengers that  fulfilled his wish and word. It is necessary to place this definition of  the first part of the belief of the Egyptian at the beginning of the  first chapter of this brief account of the principal religious ideas  which he held, for the whole of his theology and religion was based upon  it; and it is also necessary to add that, however far back we follow his  literature, we never seem to approach a time when he was without this  remarkable belief. It is true that he also developed polytheistic ideas  and beliefs, and that he cultivated them at certain periods of his  history with diligence, and to such a degree that the nations around,  and even the stranger in his country, were misled by his actions, and  described him as a polytheistic idolater.
