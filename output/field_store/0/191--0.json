This volume has been thoroughly revised for the present edition and  considerably enlarged throughout, in order to render it more accurate and  more illustrative, while bringing it fairly up to date with reference to  scientific investigation. Numerous histories have also been added to the  Appendix.    It has not been found necessary to modify the main doctrines set forth ten  years ago. At the same time, however, it may be mentioned, as regards the  first study in the volume, that our knowledge of the physiological  mechanism of the sexual instinct has been revolutionized during recent  years. This is due to the investigations that have been made, and the  deductions that have been built up, concerning the part played by  hormones, or internal secretions of the ductless glands, in the physical  production of the sexual instinct and the secondary sexual characters. The  conception of the psychology of the sexual impulse here set forth, while  correlated to terms of a physical process of tumescence and detumescence,  may be said to be independent of the ultimate physiological origins of  that process. But we cannot fail to realize the bearing of physiological  chemistry in this field; and the doctrine of internal secretions, since it  may throw light on many complex problems presented by the sexual instinct,  is full of interest for us.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.    June, 1913.          PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.      The present volume of _Studies_ deals with some of the most essential  problems of sexual psychology. The _Analysis of the Sexual Impulse_ is  fundamental. Unless we comprehend the exact process which is being worked  out beneath the shifting and multifold phenomena presented to us we can  never hope to grasp in their true relations any of the normal or abnormal  manifestations of this instinct. I do not claim that the conception of the  process here stated is novel or original. Indeed, even since I began to  work it out some years ago, various investigators in these fields,  especially in Germany, have deprived it of any novelty it might otherwise  have possessed, while at the same time aiding me in reaching a more  precise statement. This is to me a cause of satisfaction. On so  fundamental a matter I should have been sorry to find myself tending to a  peculiar and individual standpoint. It is a source of gratification to me  that the positions I have reached are those toward which current  intelligent and scientific opinions are tending. Any originality in my  study of this problem can only lie in the bringing together of elements  from somewhat diverse fields. I shall be content if it is found that I  have attained a fairly balanced, general, and judicial statement of these  main factors in the sexual instinct.    In the study of _Love and Pain_ I have discussed the sources of those  aberrations which are commonly called, not altogether happily, \"sadism\"  and \"masochism.\" Here we are brought before the most extreme and perhaps  the most widely known group of sexual perversions. I have considered them  from the medico-legal standpoint, because that has already been done by  other writers whose works are accessible. I have preferred to show how  these aberrations may be explained; how they may be linked on to normal  and fundamental aspects of the sexual impulse; and, indeed, in their  elementary forms, may themselves be regarded as normal. In some degree  they are present, in every case, at some point of sexual development;  their threads are subtly woven in and out of the whole psychological  process of sex. I have made no attempt to reduce their complexity to a  simplicity that would be fallacious. I hope that my attempt to unravel  these long and tangled threads will be found to make them fairly clear.    In the third study, on _The Sexual Impulse in Women_, we approach a  practical question of applied sexual psychology, and a question of the  first importance. No doubt the sex impulse in men is of great moment from  the social point of view. It is, however, fairly obvious and well  understood. The impulse in women is not only of at least equal moment, but  it is far more obscure. The natural difficulties of the subject have been  increased by the assumption of most writers who have touched it--casually  and hurriedly, for the most part--that the only differences to be sought  in the sexual impulse in man and in woman are quantitative differences. I  have pointed out that we may more profitably seek for qualitative  differences, and have endeavored to indicate such of these differences as  seem to be of significance.    In an Appendix will be found a selection of histories of more or less  normal sexual development. Histories of gross sexual perversion have often  been presented in books devoted to the sexual instinct; it has not  hitherto been usual to inquire into the facts of normal sexual  development. Yet it is concerning normal sexual development that our  ignorance is greatest, and the innovation can scarcely need justification.  I have inserted these histories not only because many of them are highly  instructive in themselves, but also because they exhibit the nature of the  material on which my work is mainly founded.    I am indebted to many correspondents, medical and other, in various parts  of the world, for much valuable assistance. When they have permitted me  to do so I have usually mentioned their names in the text. This has not  been possible in the case of many women friends and correspondents, to  whom, however, my debt is very great. Nature has put upon women the  greater part of the burden of sexual reproduction; they have consequently  become the supreme authorities on all matters in which the sexual emotions  come into question. Many circumstances, however, that are fairly obvious,  conspire to make it difficult for women to assert publicly the wisdom and  knowledge which, in matters of love, the experiences of life have brought  to them. The ladies who, in all earnestness and sincerity, write books on  these questions are often the last people to whom we should go as the  representatives of their sex; those who know most have written least. I  can therefore but express again, as in previous volumes I have expressed  before, my deep gratitude to these anonymous collaborators who have aided  me in throwing light on a field of human life which is of such primary  social importance and is yet so dimly visible.

As in many other of these _Studies_, and perhaps more than in most, the  task attempted in the present volume is mainly of a tentative and  preliminary character. There is here little scope yet for the presentation  of definite scientific results. However it may be in the physical  universe, in the cosmos of science our knowledge must be nebulous before  it constellates into definitely measurable shapes, and nothing is gained  by attempting to anticipate the evolutionary process. Thus it is that  here, for the most part, we have to content ourselves at present with the  task of mapping out the field in broad and general outlines, bringing  together the facts and considerations which indicate the direction in  which more extended and precise results will in the future be probably  found.    In his famous _Descent of Man_, wherein he first set forth the doctrine of  sexual selection, Darwin injured an essentially sound principle by  introducing into it a psychological confusion whereby the physiological  sensory stimuli through which sexual selection operates were regarded as  equivalent to aesthetic preferences. This confusion misled many, and it is  only within recent years (as has been set forth in the \"Analysis of the  Sexual Impulse\" in the previous volume of these _Studies_) that the  investigations and criticisms of numerous workers have placed the doctrine  of sexual selection on a firm basis by eliminating its hazardous aesthetic  element. Love springs up as a response to a number of stimuli to  tumescence, the object that most adequately arouses tumescence being that  which evokes love; the question of aesthetic beauty, although it develops  on this basis, is not itself fundamental and need not even be consciously  present at all. When we look at these phenomena in their broadest  biological aspects, love is only to a limited extent a response to beauty;  to a greater extent beauty is simply a name for the complexus of stimuli  which most adequately arouses love. If we analyze these stimuli to  tumescence as they proceed from a person of the opposite sex we find that  they are all appeals which must come through the channels of four senses:  touch, smell, hearing, and, above all, vision. When a man or a woman  experiences sexual love for one particular person from among the multitude  by which he or she is surrounded, this is due to the influences of a group  of stimuli coming through the channels of one or more of these senses.  There has been a sexual selection conditioned by sensory stimuli. This is  true even of the finer and more spiritual influences that proceed from one  person to another, although, in order to grasp the phenomena adequately,  it is best to insist on the more fundamental and less complex forms which  they assume. In this sense sexual selection is no longer a hypothesis  concerning the truth of which it is possible to dispute; it is a  self-evident fact. The difficulty is not as to its existence, but as to  the methods by which it may be most precisely measured. It is  fundamentally a psychological process, and should be approached from the  psychological side. This is the reason for dealing with it here. Obscure  as the psychological aspects of sexual selection still remain, they are  full of fascination, for they reveal to us the more intimate sides of  human evolution, of the process whereby man is molded into the shapes we  know.
