The actual amount of knowledge gained at school must needs be  small, and often quickly forgotten, but the habit of right study is an  invaluable possession.    The former method of teaching Botany was confined almost wholly to dry,  technical classification. The pupil learned to find the name and order of  a plant, but its structure, its habits, its life in short, were untouched  by him. We know now that Nature is the best text-book. The pupil should  first ask his questions of her and try to interpret her answers; then he  may learn with profit what those who better understand her speech have to  tell him.    This method of teaching, however, requires much, very much, of the  teacher. He must be himself intelligent, well trained, and able to give  time to the preparation of his lessons. It seems to us, who are but  amateurs, as if it were impossible to teach thus without a thorough  comprehension of the whole field. Our own ignorance oppresses us so much  that we feel tempted to say that we cannot attempt it. But if the work of  leading children to observe the wonders about them is to be done at all,  it must be done by us, who are not masters of our subject, and we must  find out for ourselves how we can best accomplish this result, since we  have so little to guide us.    It is with the hope that the experience of one who has tried to do  this with some fair amount of success may be of use to other puzzled  experimenters, that I venture to write out some outlines of lessons in  Botany for beginners.    The method of beginning with the simpler forms of life is one that appeals  to the scientific tendencies of the day. It seems logical to begin with  lower forms and work up to the higher. But this method is only suitable  for mature minds. We do not teach a child English by showing him the  sources of the language; he learns it by daily use. So also the beginning  of the study of any Natural Science by the young should be the observation  of the most obvious things about them, the things which they can see, and  handle, and experiment upon naturally, without artificial aids. Therefore  this book concerns itself only with the Flowering Plants.    The author believes that the simplest botanical study should afford the  means of identifying plants, as a large part of the student's pleasure in  the science will be the recognition of the things about him. The present  volume affords the basis for future classification, which Part II, on  flowers, will develop. It is, doubtless, as good a way, perhaps the best,  to begin with a single plant, and study root, stem, leaves, and flowers  as belonging to a whole, but the problem is complicated by practical  difficulties. In our climate there are but two months of the school year  when flowers are easily obtained. On the other hand, the material for  these lessons can be got throughout the winter, and the class, well  trained in methodical work, will begin the study of flowers at the season  when every day brings some fresh wonder of beauty.    The author will receive gladly any criticisms or suggestions.    JANE H. NEWELL.    175 Brattle St., Cambridge          INTRODUCTION.      The lessons here outlined are suitable for children of twelve years of  age, and upwards. For younger pupils they would require much adaptation,  and even then they would not be so good as some simpler method, such as  following the growth of one plant, and comparing it with others at every  step. The little ones profit most by describing the very simple things  that they see, without much reference to theories.    The outlines follow the plan of Dr. Gray's First Lessons and How Plants  Grow, and are intended to be used in connection with either of those  books. The necessary references will be found at the end of every section.  The book contains also references to a course of interesting reading in  connection with the subjects of the lessons.    The lessons may begin, like the text-books, with the subject of  Germination, if the seeds are planted before they are required for use,  but it is generally preferable to use the first recitation with the class  for planting the seeds, in order to have them under the direct care of the  pupils. Some general talks about plants are therefore put at the beginning  to occupy the time until the seedlings are ready for study.    Some Nasturtiums (_Tropaeolum majus_) and Morning-Glories should be planted  from the first in boxes of earth and allowed to grow over the window, as  they are often used for illustrations.          I.    PLANTS AND THEIR USES.[1]      [Footnote 1: This section may be omitted, and the lessons begun with  Seedlings, if the teacher prefer.]    What is Botany? The pupils are very apt to say at first that it is  learning about _flowers_. The teacher can draw their attention to the fact  that flowers are only a part of the plant, and that Botany is also the  study of the leaves, the stem, and the root. Botany is the science of  _plants_. Ask them what the Geranium is. Tell them to name some other  plants. The teacher should keep a few growing plants in the schoolroom for  purposes of illustration.    Ask them what else there is in the world besides plants. By this question  the three kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, are brought up. It  will give occasion for a discussion of the earth and what it contains, the  mountains, formed of rocks and soil, the plants growing on the earth,  and the animals that inhabit it, including man. Let them name the three  kingdoms with some example of each. Which of these kingdoms contain living  things? The words _organic_ and _inorganic_ can be brought in here. An  _organ_ ([Greek: Ergon], meaning work) is any part that does a special  work, as the leaves, the stem of a plant, and the eye, the ear of animals.  An _organism_ is a living being made up of such organs. The inorganic  world contains the mineral kingdom; the organic world includes the  vegetable and animal kingdoms.    One's aim in these lessons should always be to tell the pupils as little  as possible. Try to lead them to think out these things for themselves.    Ask them how plants differ from animals. They will say that plants are  fixed to one place, while animals can move about; that plants have no will  or consciousness, and that animals have. These answers are true when we  compare the higher animals with plants, but the differences become lost as  we descend in the scale and approach the border land where botanist and  zoologist meet on a common ground. Sea-anemones are fixed to the rock on  which they grow, while some of the lower plants are able to move from  place to place, and it is hardly safe to affirm that a jelly-fish is more  conscious of its actions than is a Sensitive Plant, the leaves of which  close when the stem is touched.    There is no real division between animals and plants. We try to classify  the objects about us into groups, according to the closeness of their  relationships, but we must always remember that these hard lines are ours,  not Nature's. We attempt, for purposes of our own convenience, to divide a  whole, which is so bound together that it cannot be separated into parts  that we can confidently place on different sides of a dividing line.      1. _Plants as Food-Producers_.--The chief distinguishing characteristic of  plants is one that the pupils may be led to think out for themselves by  asking them what animals feed upon. To help them with this, ask them what  they had for breakfast. Oatmeal is mentioned, perhaps. This is made from  oats, which is a plant. Coffee and tea, bread made from wheat, potatoes,  etc., all come from plants.[1] Beef, butter and milk come from the cow,  but the cow lives upon grass. The plant, on the other hand, is nourished  upon mineral or inorganic matter. It can make its own food from the soil  and the air, while animals can only live upon that which is made for  them by plants. These are thus the link between the mineral and animal  kingdoms. Ask the scholars if they can think of anything to eat or drink  that does not come from a plant. With a little help they will think of  salt and water. These could not support life. So we see that animals  receive all their food through the vegetable kingdom. One great use of  plants is that they are _food-producers_.    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany, for use in Schools.

Ils sont tout entiers dans la  moment qu'ils vivent et leur genie se ramasse sur un point.\"    ANATOLE FRANCE        MAHOMET      INTRODUCTION    The impetus that gave victory to Islam is spent. Since its material  prosperity overwhelmed its spiritual ascendancy in the first years of  triumph its vitality has waned under the stress of riches, then beneath  lassitude and the slow decrease of power. The Prophet Mahomet is at once  the glory and bane of his people, the source of their strength and the  mainspring of their weakness. He represents more effectively than any  other religious teacher the sum of his followers' spiritual and worldly  ideas. His position in religion and philosophy is substantially the  position of all his followers; none have progressed beyond the primary  thesis he gave to the Arabian world at the close of his career.    He closes a long line of semi-divine teachers and monitors. After him the  curtains of heaven close, and its glory is veiled from men's eyes. He is  the last great man who imposed enthusiasm for an idea upon countless  numbers of his fellow-creatures, so that whole tribes fought and died at  his bidding, and at the command of God through him. Now that the vital  history of Islam has been written, some decision as to the position and  achievements of its founder may be formulated.    Mahomet conceived the office of Prophet to be the result of an  irresistible divine call. Verily the angel Gabriel appeared to him,  commanding him to \"arise and warn.\" He was the vehicle through whom the  will of Allah was revealed. The inspired character of his rule was the  prime factor in its prevailing; by virtue of his heavenly authority he  exercised his sway over the religious actions of his followers, their  aspirations and their beliefs. In order to promulgate the divine  ordinances the Kuran was sent down, inspired directly by the angel  Gabriel at the bidding of the Lord. Upon all matters of belief and upon  all other matters dealt with, however cursorily, in the Kuran Mahomet  spoke with the power of God Himself; upon matters not within the scope of  religion or of the Sacred Book he was only a human and fallible  counsellor.    \"I am no more than man; when I order you anything with respect to  religion, receive it, and when I order you about the affairs of the  world, then am I nothing more than man.\"    There is no question of his equality with the Godhead, or even of his  sharing any part of the divine nature. He is simply the instrument,  endowed with a power and authority outside himself, a man who possesses  one cardinal thesis which all those within his faith must accept.    The idea which represents at once the scope of his teaching and the  source of his triumphs is the unity and indivisibility of the Godhead.  This is the sole contribution he has made to the progressive thought of  the world. Though he came later in time than the culture of Greece and  Rome, he never knew their philosophies or the sum of their knowledge. His  religion could never he built upon such basic strength as Christianity.  It sprang too rapidly into prominence, and had no foundation of slowly  developed ideas upon which to rest both its enthusiasm and its earthly  endeavour.    Mahomet bears closer resemblance to the ancient Hebrew prophets than to  any Christian leader or saint. His mind was akin to theirs in its  denunciatory fury, its prostration before the might and majesty  of a single God. The evolution of the tribal deity from the local  wonderworker, whose shrine enclosed his image, to the impersonal and  distant but awful power who held the earth beneath his sway, was  Mahomet's contribution to the mental development of his country, and the  achievement within those confines was wonderful. But to the sum of the  world's thought he gave little. His central tenet had already gained its  votaries in other lands, and, moreover, their form of belief in one God  was such that further development of thought was still possible to them.  The philosophy of Islam blocks the way of evolution for itself, because  its system leaves no room for such pregnant ideas as divine incarnation,  divine immanence, the fatherhood of God. It has been content to formulate  one article of faith: \"There is no God but God,\" the corollary as to  Mahomet's divine appointment to the office of Prophet being merely an  affirmation of loyalty to the particular mode of faith he imposed.  Therefore the part taken by Islam in the reading of the world's  mystery ceased with the acceptance of that previously conceived central  tenet.    In the sphere of ideas, indeed, Mahomet gave his people nothing original,  for his power did not lie in intellect, but in action. His mind had not  passed the stage that has just exchanged many fetishes for one spiritual  God, still to be propitiated, not alone by sacrifices, but by prayers,  ceremonies, and praise. In the world of action lay the strength of Islam  and the genius of its founder; it is therefore in the impress it made  upon events and not in its theology and philosophy that its secret is to  be found. But besides the acceptance of one God as Lord, Islam forced  upon its devotees a still more potent idea, whose influence is felt both  in the spheres of thought and action.    As an outcome of its political and military needs Mahomet created and  established its unassailable belief in fatality--not the fatalism  of cause and effect, bearing within itself the essence of a reason too  vast for humanity to comprehend, but the fatalism of an omnipotent and  capricious power inherent in the Mahomedan conception of God. With this  mighty and irresponsible being nothing can prevail. Before every event  the result of it is irrevocably decreed. Mankind can alter no tiniest  detail of his destined lot. The idea corresponds with Mahomet's vision of  God--an awful, incomprehensible deity, who dwells perpetually in the  terrors of earth, not in its gentleness and compassion. The doctrine of  fatalism proved Islam's greatest asset during its first hard years of  struggle, for it gave to its battlefields the glory of God's  surveillance: \"Death is a favour to a Muslim.\" But with prosperity and  conquest came inaction; then fatalism, out of the weakening of endurance,  created the pessimism of Islam's later years. Being philosophically  uncreative, it descended into the sloth of those who believe, without  exercise of reason or will, in the uselessness of effort.    Before Islam decayed into inertia it had experienced a fierce and flaming  life. The impulse bestowed upon it by its founder operated chiefly in the  religious world, and indirectly in the realm of political and military  power. How far the religion of Islam is indebted to Mahomet's knowledge  of the Jewish and Christian systems becomes clear upon a study of the  Kuran and the Muslim institutions. That Mahomet was familiar with Jewish  Scriptures and tradition is beyond doubt.    The middle portion of the Kuran is filled to the point of weariness with  reiterations of Jewish legend and hero-myths. It is evident that Mahomet  took the God of the Jews to be his own deity, combining in his conception  also the traditional connection of Jehovah and His Chosen People with the  ancient faith and ceremonies of Mecca, purged of their idolatries. From  the Jews he took his belief in the might and terror of the Lord and the  admonitory character of his mission. From them also he took the  separatist nature of his creed. The Jewish teachers postulated a religion  distinct from every other belief, self-sufficient, owning no interpreter  save the Law and the Scriptures. Mahomet conceived himself also as the  sole vehicle during his lifetime and after his death for the commands of  the Most High. He aimed at the superseding of Rabbinical power, and hoped  to win the Jews into recognition of himself as successor to their own  teachers and prophets.    But his claims were met by an unyielding reliance upon the completed Law.  If the Jewish religion had rejected a Redeemer from among its own people,  it was impossible that it should accept a leader from an alien and  despised race. Mahomet, finding coalition impossible, gave free play to  his separatist instinct, so that in this respect, and also in its  fundamental conception of the deity, as well as in its reliance upon  inspired Scriptures and oral traditions, Mahomedanism approximates to the  Jewish system. It misses the influence of an immemorial history, and  receives no help in its campaign of warfare from the traditional glories  of long lines of warrior kings. Chief of all, it lacks the inspiration of  the matchless Jewish Scriptures and Sacred Books, depending for  instruction upon a document confined to the revelation of one man's  personality and view of life.    Still the narrowness of the Mahomedan system provoked its power; its  rapid rush to the heights Of dominion was born of the straitening of its  impulse into the channel of conquest and the forcible imposition of its  faith.    Of Christianity Mahomet knew far less than of Judaism. He went to the "]]]
