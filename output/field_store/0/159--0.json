The revolutions of society are almost as sure if not as regular as  those of the planets. The inventions of a generation weary after  a while, but they are very likely to be revived if they have once  ministered successfully to pleasure or ambition. The famous coteries  in which learning was inter-blended with fashion in the golden age  of French intelligence, are being revived under the new Republic,  and women are again quietly playing with institutions and liberties,  perhaps as dangerously as when Mesdames de Tencin, Pompadour,  Geoffrin, Deffant, Popliniere and L'Espinasse assembled the destinies  nightly in their drawing rooms.    The tendency to such associations is displayed also in most of our  own cities. The Town and Country Club of Boston, the Wistar Parties  in Philadelphia, the Literary Club in Charleston, the recent  _converzaziones_ at the houses of President Charles King of Columbia  College, and others, and the well-known Saturday Evenings at Miss  Lynch's, where literature and art and general speculation have for  some seasons had a common center, all illustrate the disposition of an  active and cultivated society, not engrossed by special or spasmodic  excitements, to cluster by rules of feeling and capacity: and clusters  of passion and mind are rarely for a long period inert. When they  become common they are apt to assume the direction of private custom  and public opinion and affairs.    In view of these things, we are sure that the readers of the  _International_ will be interested in the following translation of  Professor Schlosser's brilliant survey of those _bureaux d'esprit_  which so much distinguished society and influenced its history  in Europe, from the beginning to the middle of the last century.  Schlosser is a Privy Councillor and Professor of History in the  University of Heidelberg. He is chiefly known in continental Europe  by his great work, the History of the Eighteenth Century, and of  the Nineteenth till the overthrow of the French Empire, a work which  derives its value not merely from the profound and minute acquaintance  of the author with the subject, from the new views which are presented  and the hitherto unexamined sources from which much has been derived,  but from his well-known independence of character--from the general  conclusions which he draws from the comparative views of the  resources, conduct, manners, institutions and literature of the great  European nations, during a period unparalleled in the history of  the world for the development of the physical and mental powers of  mankind, for the greatness of the events which occurred, for the  progress of knowledge, for the cultivation of the arts and sciences,  for all that contributes to the greatness and prosperity of nations.           *       *       *       *       *    If we venture to bring the Parisian evening, dinner and supper parties  into connection with the general history of Europe, and the ladies  also at whose houses these parties took place, we can neither be  blamed for scrupulous severity, nor for paradoxical frivolity. It  belongs to the character of the eighteenth century, that the historian  who wishes to bring the true springs of conduct and sources of action  to light, must condescend even so far. It must also be borne in mind,  when the clever women and societies of Paris are spoken of, that  the demands of the age and progressive improvement and culture were  altogether unattended to at the court of Louis XV., as well before as  after the death of Cardinal Fleury, and that all which was neglected  at Versailles was cultivated in Paris. The court and the city had been  hitherto united in their wants and in their judgment; the court ruled  education, fashion and the general tone, as it ruled the state; now,  however, they completely separated. Afterward the voice of the city  was raised in opposition, and the voice of this opposition became the  organ of the age and of the country; but it was felt and recognized  in Versailles only when it was too late. How easy it would have  been then, as Marmontel had shown very clearly in his memoirs, to  fetter Voltaire, who was offensive to the people, and how important  this would have been for the state, will appear in the following  paragraphs, in which we shall show that even the Parisian theatre,  whose boards were regarded as a model by all Europe, freed itself  from the influence of the court, became dependent on the tone-giving  circles of Paris, and assumed a decidedly democratic direction.    As early as the time of Louis XIV., the court had separated itself  from the learned men of the age; and at the end of the seventeenth  century the houses and societies could be historically pointed out,  in which judgments were pronounced upon questions of literature in  the same manner as the pit became the tribunal to which plays and  play-actors must appeal; we shall not, however, go back so far, but  keep the later times always in our view. In those associations in  which the Abbe de Chaulieu and other friends of Vendome and Conti led  the conversation, literature was brought wholly under the dominion of  audacious pretension and immorality, in the time of the Regency and  during the minority of Louis XV. In reference to the leaders there  needs no proof. What could a Philip of Orleans or his Dubois take  under his protection, except what corresponded with his ideas and mode  of life?    The time of the minority of Louis XV. and that of the administration  of Cardinal Fleury was for several reasons highly favorable to the  formation of private societies, which entertained themselves with  wit and satire, and carried on a quiet but continual contest with the  persons and systems which were protected by the government and the  clergy. Fleury regarded everything as sinful which had the appearance  of worldly knowledge, or partook of the character of jests, novels,  or plays; Louis, as he grew up, showed himself quite indifferent to  everything which had no connection with religious ceremonies, hunting,  or handsome women. Fleury spoke and wrote in that ecclesiastical  phraseology which was laughed at in the world: he favored the clergy,  school learning, the tone of the times of Louis XIV.; but the spirit  of the age demanded something different from this. All that was  regarded with disfavor by Fleury assembled around those celebrated  men, who held their reunions in Paris, and this court soon became more  important to the vain than the royal one itself, and it was proved by  experience that reputation and glory might be gained without the  aid or protection of the court at Versailles. This no one could have  previously believed, but the public soon learnt to do homage to the  tone-giving scholars, to the ladies and gentlemen who fostered them,  as it had formerly paid its homage to the ministers of the court.  This gave to the ladies, who collected around them the celebrated men  of the time (for reputation was much more the question than merit,)  and who protected and entertained them, a degree of weight in the  political and literary world, which made them as important in  the eighteenth century as Richelieu and Colbert had been in the  seventeenth.    The queen, on her part, might have been able to exercise a beneficial  influence, however little power she had in other respects, when  compared with the mistresses of the king; but the daughter of  Stanislaus Leckzinski was a gentle, admirable woman, although somewhat  narrow-minded, and wholly given up to irrational devotional exercises  and bigotry. Like her father, she was altogether in the hands of the  Jesuits, blindly and unconditionally their servant; such an attachment  to a religious order, and such blind devotedness as hers would be  quite incredible, if we did not possess her own and her father's  autograph letters, as proofs of the fact. We shall present our readers  with some extracts from these letters, which are preserved in the  archives of the French empire, when we come to speak of the abolition  of the order of Jesuits.    As to the enlightened mistresses who had much more power and influence  than the queen, Pompadour seemed, as we learn from Marmontel, desirous  of participating in the literature of the age and of doing something  for its promotion, when she saw how important writers and the  influence of the press had become; but partly because both she and  the king were altogether destitute of any sense for the beautiful  in literature or art, and partly because the better portion of the  learned men at the time neither could nor would be pleased with what  a Bernis, Dueclos and Marmontel were disposed to be, who undoubtedly  received some marks of favor from her. Voltaire is therefore quite  right when he lays upon the court the blame of allowing the influence  which literature then exercised upon the people, to be withdrawn  altogether from king and his ministers, and to be transferred to the  hands of the Parisian ladies and farmers-general, &c. Voltaire, in his  well-known verses,[1] admits, with great openness and simplicity, that  he attached much importance to the applause of a court, although it  neither possessed judgment nor feeling for the merits of a writer,  nor for poetical beauties; and he complains at the same time that this  court had neither duly estimated his tragedies nor his epic poems. It  is characteristic both of the court and of Voltaire that he eagerly  pressed himself forward for admission to its favor, and sought to  attract attention by a work which be himself called a piece of trash,  and that the court extended its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#1)"],[1,"VOLUME X      PRINCE OTTO VON BISMARCK    COUNT HELMUTH VON MOLTKE    FERDINAND LASSALLE            THE GERMAN CLASSICS    Masterpieces of German Literature            TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH    Patrons' Edition        IN TWENTY VOLUMES        ILLUSTRATED    1914             CONTENTS OF VOLUME X      Prince Otto Von Bismarck      Bismarck as a National Type.

Professor of the History of  German Culture, Harvard University.      No man since Luther has been a more complete embodiment of German  nationality than Otto von Bismarck. None has been closer to the German  heart. None has stood more conspicuously for racial aspirations,  passions, ideals.    It is the purpose of the present sketch to bring out a few of these  affinities between Bismarck and the German people.    I    Perhaps the most obviously Teutonic trait in Bismarck's character is  its martial quality. It would be preposterous, surely, to claim  warlike distinction as a prerogative of the German race. Russians,  Frenchmen, Englishmen, Americans, undoubtedly, make as good fighters  as Germans. But it is not an exaggeration to say that there is no  country in the world where the army is as enlightened or as popular an  institution as it is in Germany.    The German army is not composed of hirelings of professional fighters  whose business it is to pick quarrels, no matter with whom. It is, in  the strictest sense of the word, the people in arms. Among its  officers there is a large percentage of the intellectual elite of the  country; its rank and file embrace every occupation and every class of  society, from the scion of royal blood down to the son of the  seamstress. Although it is based upon the unconditional  acceptance of the monarchical creed, nothing is farther removed from  it than the spirit of servility. On the contrary, one of the very  first teachings which are inculcated upon the German recruit is that,  in wearing the \"king's coat,\" he is performing a public duty, and that  by performing this duty he is honoring himself. Nor can it be said  that it is the aim of German military drill to reduce the soldier to a  mere machine, at will to be set in motion or be brought to a  standstill by his superior. The aim of this drill is rather to give  each soldier increased self-control, mentally no less than bodily; to  develop his self-respect; to enlarge his sense of responsibility, as  well as to teach him the absolute necessity of the subordination of  the individual to the needs of the whole. The German army, then, is by  no means a lifeless tool that might be used by an unscrupulous and  adventurous despot to gratify his own whims or to wreak his private  vengeance. The German army is, in principle at least, a national  school of manly virtues, of discipline, of comradeship, of  self-sacrifice, of promptness of action, of tenacity of purpose.  Although, probably, the most powerful armament which the world has  ever seen, it makes for peace rather than for war. Although called  upon to defend the standard of the most imperious dynasty of western  Europe, it contains more of the spirit of true democracy than many a  city government on this side of the Atlantic.    All this has to be borne in mind if we wish to judge correctly of  Bismarck's military propensities. He has never concealed the fact that  he felt himself, above all, a soldier. One of his earliest public  utterances was a defense of the Prussian army against the sympathizers  with the revolution of 1848. His first great political achievement was  the carrying through, in the early sixties, of King William's army  reform in the face of the most stubborn and virulent opposition of a  parliamentary majority. Never, in the years following the formation of  the Empire, did his speech in the German Parliament rise to a higher  pathos than when he was asserting the military supremacy of the  Emperor, or calling upon the parties to forget their dissensions in  maintaining the defensive strength of the nation, or showering  contempt upon liberal deputies who seemed to think that questions of  national existence could be solved by effusions of academic oratory.  Over and over, during the last decade of his official career, did he  declare that the only thing which kept him from throwing aside the  worry and vexation of governmental duties and retiring to the much  coveted leisure of home and hearth, was the oath of vassal loyalty  constraining him to stand at his post until his imperial master  released him of his own accord. And at the very height of his  political triumphs he wrote to his sovereign: \"I have always regretted  that my talents did not allow me to testify my attachment to the royal  house and my enthusiasm for the greatness and glory of the Fatherland  in the front rank of a regiment rather than behind a writing-desk. And  even now, after having been raised by your Majesty to the highest  honors of a statesman, I cannot altogether repress a feeling of regret  at not having been similarly able to carve out a career for myself as  a soldier. Perhaps I should have made a poor general, but if I had  been free to follow the bent of my own inclination I would rather have  won battles for your Majesty than diplomatic campaigns.\"    It seems clear that both the defects and the greatness of Bismarck's  character are intimately associated with these military leanings of  his. He certainly was overbearing; he could tolerate no opposition; he  was revengeful and unforgiving; he took pleasure in the appeal to  violence; he easily resorted to measures of repression; he requited  insults with counter-insults; he had something of that blind _furor  Teutonicus_ which was the terror of the Italian republics in the  Middle Ages. These are defects of temper which will probably prevent  his name from ever shining with that serene lustre of international  veneration that has surrounded the memory of a Joseph II. or a  Washington with a kind of impersonal immaculateness. But his  countrymen, at least, have every reason to condone these defects; for  they are concomitant results of the military bent of German character,  and they are offset by such transcendent military virtues that we  would almost welcome them as bringing this colossal figure within the  reach of our own frailties and shortcomings.    Three of the military qualities that made Bismarck great seem to me to  stand out with particular distinctness: his readiness to take the most  tremendous responsibilities, if he could justify his action by the  worth of the cause for which he made himself responsible; his  moderation after success was assured; his unflinching submission to  the dictates of monarchical discipline.    Moritz Busch has recorded an occurrence, belonging to the autumn of  1877, which most impressively brings before us the tragic grandeur and  the portentous issues of Bismarck's career."]]]
