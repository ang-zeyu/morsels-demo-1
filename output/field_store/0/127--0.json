TO                     THE RIGHT HONOURABLE                   LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH,           ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL SECRETARIES                  OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.            MY LORD,      Hightly flattered by your Lordship's polite condescension, in permitting me  to inscribe to you the following Pages, I return your Lordship my most  unfeigned thanks.    If they meet your Lordship's approbation, and that of a discerning Public;  or if they tend in the most remote degree to excite more intelligent  efforts and more active enterprise on behalf of the unenlightened African,  or to augment the Commerce of the United Kingdom with a Country, now in  danger of falling into the hands of our Enemies, I shall feel an ample  reward for the risques and dangers to which I have been exposed in  collecting these Fragments; while the occasion gives me the opportunity of  subscribing myself,                              With grateful acknowledgments,                                 Your Lordship's                    Most obedient, and devoted humble Servant,                                                JOSEPH CORRY,    PREFACE.    With becoming deference, I shall endeavour to illustrate in the following  pages, the observations I have personally made upon the Coast of Africa,  and to give the information I have obtained from an extended circle of  Chiefs, and native Tribes, relative to its Inhabitants, their Religion,  Habits and Customs, the natural productions and commercial resources, &c.  and attempt to delineate the most eligible grounds upon which the condition  of the African may be effectually improved, and our commercial relations be  preserved with that important quarter of the globe.    Though deeply impressed with the importance of the subject, and my own  incompetency, I obtrude myself upon Public notice, governed by this  reflection, that I am stimulated by an ardent zeal for the prosperity of my  Country, and am animated by a philanthropic solicitude for the effectual  manumission of the African, from his enslaved customs, his superstitious  idolatry, and for the enlargement of his intellectual powers.    I shall guard against the sacrifice of truth to abstracted principles; and  if in the most remote degree, I excite the interference of my countrymen in  behalf of the African, extend our commerce, and enlarge the circle of  civilized and Christian Society, I shall think that I have neither  travelled, nor written in vain.    Africa is a country hitherto but little known; those in general who have  visited it, have been either inadequate to research, or have been absorbed  in the immediate attainment of gain; moreover the European Traveller in  that country has to contend with the combined influence of the native  jealousies of its inhabitants, their hereditary barbarism, obstinate  ferocity, and above all, an uncongenial climate. To surmount these  difficulties, commerce is the most certain medium to inspire its Chiefs and  Natives with confidence, and to obtain a facility of intercourse with the  Interior country. Sanctioned by that pursuit, I have been favoured with  information from a large circle of Native Chiefs, and Tribes, relative to  their customs, their habits, localities, predilections, and the existing  state of society.    The impressions, which ocular demonstration, and personal investigation  occasion upon visiting this uncultivated country, are so different from  those excited in any other district of the globe, and so powerful, that the  mind is naturally led to meditation on the means of its improvement and on  the mode by which it may be ameliorated, and the sources of commerce be  essentially enlarged.    Europe, which merits the highest rank for philanthropy, has hitherto  strangely neglected this country; nor have the attempts of individuals and  benevolent Societies been productive in endeavouring to diffuse the  influence of civilization, and to desseminate the seeds of science  throughout these extensive regions.    Trusting that my endeavours to befriend the Natives of Africa, and to  extend the Commerce of my Country, will shield me from the severity of  animadversion, and of criticism, I shall proceed in my relation.

VOL. 20, NO. 582.] SATURDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1832. [PRICE 2d.                 *       *       *       *       *            [Illustration: THE YORK COLUMN, (from St. James's Park.)]          THE YORK COLUMN.      Five years have now elapsed since the improvements in St. James's Park  were commenced, by order of Government, for the gratification of the  people. We were early in our congratulation, as well as illustration, of  the prospective advantages of these plans for the public enjoyment, as  will be seen on reference to our tenth volume; and, with respect to the  re-disposal of St. James's Park, we believe the feeling of satisfaction  has been nearly universal.    At the period to which we have just alluded, the removal of Carlton  House, (for it scarcely deserved the name of Palace,) had been decided  on. The walls were dismantled of their decorative finery, and their  demolition commenced; the grounds were, to use a somewhat grandiloquent  phrase, dis-afforested; and the upper end of \"the sweet, shady side  of Pall Mall\" marked out for public instead of Royal occupation. Thus,  within a century has risen and disappeared from this spot the splendid  abode and its appurtenances; for, it was in the year 1732 that Frederic,  Prince of Wales, first purchased the property from the Earl of  Burlington; though it was not until 1788 that the erection of Carlton  House was commenced for the late King, then Prince of Wales; so that the  existence of the Palace must be restricted within forty years--a term  reminding us of the duration of a pavilion, rather than of a kingly  mansion.    Upon the precise site of the courtyard and part of Carlton House have  been erected two mansions, of splendid character, appropriated to the  United Service and Athenaeum Clubs: the first built from the designs of  Mr. Nash, and the latter from those of Mr. Decimus Burton. They front  Pall Mall West, or may be considered to terminate Waterloo Place.    The site of Carlton House Gardens is now occupied by palatial houses,  which are disposed in two ranges, and front St. James's Park. The  substructure, containing the kitchens and domestic offices, forms a  terrace about 50 feet wide, adorned with pillars of the Paestum Doric  Order, surmounted with a balustrade. The superstructure consists of  three stories, ornamented with Corinthian columns. The houses at each  extremity have elevated attics. Only small portions of these superb  elevations are shown in the Engraving, with the Athenaeum Club House in  the distance.    In the space between the two ranges, it was proposed to erect a  fountain, formed of the eight column's of the portico of Carlton House,  (which was in elaborate imitation of the Temple of Jupiter Stator,  at Rome,[1]) to which eight on the same model were to be added. The  balustraded terrace had been continued fronting the Park with a view to  this embellishment. It however occurred to some guardian of the public  weal, that the above space presented an eligible opportunity for a grand  public entrance from Pall Mall into the Park. The idea was mooted in  Parliament; but some difficulties arose, from the leases already granted  to the builders of the houses on the terrace, who had calculated on the  _exclusive_ appropriation of the latter. The anxiety of the public  for the improvement at length reached the present King; and it was the  first popular act of his patriotic reign to command a grand triumphal[2]  entrance to be formed, with all possible speed; the difficulties  being then easily removed. The necessary portion of the terrace was  accordingly removed, and the magnificent approach formed, as shown in  the Engraving.    While these improvements were in progress, a monumental memorial had  been projected by the British Army to their late commander-in-chief, the  Duke of York; an expression of grateful sympathy which must be recorded  to the honour of truly British hearts. The funds for this tribute were  augmented by each individual of the above branch of the service  contributing one day's pay. The design was furnished by Mr. Benjamin  Wyatt, the architect of the superb mansion built for the Duke of York;  and, after the execution was somewhat advanced, it was resolved to set  up the tribute in the place it now occupies.    The monument consists of a plain Doric column, surmounted with a  colossal statue of the Duke of York. The pedestal and shaft are of fine  granite. The plinth, or base of the pedestal, is 22 feet square, and the  pedestal 18 feet; the circumference of the shaft is 11 feet 6 inches,  decreasing to 10 feet 2 inches at the top; the abacus is 13 feet 6  inches square. The interior of the column may be ascended by a winding  staircase of 169 steps, lit by narrow loop-holes.    From the top stair a doorway opens to the exterior of the abacus, which  will be enclosed with a massive iron railing, so as to form a prospect  gallery. The iron-work is not yet completed; but, as we have enjoyed the  view from two sides of the square, we can vouch for its commanding a  fine _coup d'oeil_ of the whole metropolis, and certainly the  finest view of its most embellished quarter. From this spot alone can  the magnificence of Regent-street be duly appreciated, and above all the  skill of the architect in effecting the junction of the lines by the  classical introduction of the Quadrant.    That part of the structure which is, strictly speaking, upon the abacus  of the column, has a domed roof, upon which will be placed the colossal  statue, executed in bronze, by Mr. Westmacott. The Duke is represented  in a flowing robe, with a sword in his right hand, and in the left, one  of the insignia of the Order of the Garter. The height of the figure  is 13 feet 6 inches. The total height of the column, exclusive of the  statue, is 124 feet. The masonry, (executed by Mr. Nowell, of Pimlico,)  deserves especial notice. Its neatness and finish are truly astonishing,  and the solidity and massiveness of the material appear calculated \"for  all time.\"    We should mention that the embellishment about the upper part of the  pedestal (as seen in the cut,) has not yet been placed on the original;  nor has the statue yet been raised to the summit of the column.        [1] The above columns, with those of the handsome Ionic calonnade          which screened the Palace from Pall Mall, are, we believe, the          only remains of the building.        [2] The entrance deserves this epithet on more than one account.           *       *       *       *       *          MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT AND MODERN CHRISTMAS.      \"Anciently there was in the king's house,\" says Stow, \"wheresoever he  lodged, at the feast of Christmas, a 'Lord of Misrule, or Master of  Merry Disports;' and the like also was there in the house of every  nobleman of honour or good worship, whether spiritual or temporal.  Among these, the Mayor and Sheriffs of London had their several Lords of  Misrule, ever contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make  the rarest pastime to divert the beholders. These Lords began their  rule, or rather misrule, on All Hallow's-eve, and continued the same  until Candlemas-day, in which space there were fine and subtle  disguisings, masques, and mummeries, with playing at cards for counters,  nails, and points, in every house, more for pastime than for gain.  Against this feast, the parish churches and every man's house were  decked with holm, ivy, bay, and whatsoever the season of the year  afforded that was green; and the conduits and standards in the streets  were likewise garnished.\"    W.G.C.      _Kent._    At Ramsgate they commence their Christmas festivities by the following  ceremony:--A party of the youthful portion of the community having  procured the head of a horse, it is affixed to a pole, about four feet  in length; a string is attached to the lower jaw, a horse-cloth is tied  round the extreme part of the head, beneath which one of the party is  concealed, who, by repeated pulling and loosening the string, causes  the jaw to rise and fall, and thus produces, by bringing the teeth in  contact, a snapping noise, as he moves along; the rest of the party  following in procession, grotesquely habited, and ringing hand-bells!  In this order they proceed from house to house, singing carols and  ringing their bells, and are generally remunerated for the amusement  they occasion by a largess of money, or beer and cake. This ceremony is  called \"a hoodening.\" The figure which we have described is designated  \"a hooden,\" or wooden horse. The ceremony prevails in many parts of  the Isle of Thanet, and may probably be traced as the relic of some  religious ceremony practised in the early ages by our Saxon ancestors.      _Norfolk._    The following account of a pageant which took place at Christmas, 1440,  is from the records of Norwich:--\"John Hadman, a wealthy citizen, made  disport with his neighbours and friends, and was crowned King of  Christmas. He rode in state through the city, dressed forth in silks and  tinsel, and preceded by twelve persons habited as the twelve months of  the year, their costumes varying to represent the different seasons of  the year. Alter King Christmas followed Lent, clothed in white garments  trimmed with herring skins, on horseback, the horse being decorated with  trappings of oyster-shells, being indicative that sadness and a holy  time should follow Christmas revelling. In this way they rode through  the city, accompanied by numbers in various grotesque dresses,"]]]
