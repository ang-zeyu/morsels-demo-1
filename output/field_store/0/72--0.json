AA'RON, a Moor, beloved by Tam'ora, queen of the Goths,  in the tragedy of _Titus Andron'icus_, published among the plays of  Shakespeare (1593).    (The classic name is _Andronicus_, but the character of this play is  purely fictitious.)    _Aaron (St.)_, a British martyr of the City of Legions (_Newport_,  in South Wales). He was torn limb from limb by order of Maximian'us  Hercu'lius, general in Britain, of the army of Diocle'tian. Two  churches were founded in the City of Legions, one in honor of St.  Aaron and one in honor of his fellow-martyr, St. Julius. Newport was  called Caerleon by the British.      ... two others ... sealed their doctrine with    their blood;    St. Julius, and with him St. Aaron, have their    room    At Carleon, suffering death by Diocletian's doom.  Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv, (1622).    AAZ'IZ (3 _syl._), so the queen of Sheba or Saba is sometimes called;  but in the Koran she is called Balkis (ch. xxvii.).    ABAD'DON, an angel of the bottomless pit (_Rev_. ix. 11). The word is  derived from the Hebrew, _abad_, \"lost,\" and means _the lost one_.  There are two other angels introduced by Klopstock in _The Messiah_  with similar names, but must not be confounded with the angel referred  to in _Rev_.; one is Obaddon, the angel of death, and the other  Abbad'ona, the repentant devil.    AB'ARIS, to whom Apollo gave a golden arrow, on which to ride through  the air.--See _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_.    ABBAD'ONA, once the friend of Ab'diel, was drawn into the rebellion of  Satan half unwillingly. In hell he constantly bewailed his fall, and  reproved Satan for his pride and blasphemy. He openly declared to the  internals that he would take no part or lot in Satan's scheme for the  death of the Messiah, and during the crucifixion lingered about the  cross with repentance, hope, and fear. His ultimate fate we are not  told, but when Satan and Adramelech are driven back to hell, Obaddon,  the angel of death, says--    \"For thee, Abbadona, I have no orders. How long thou art permitted to  remain on earth I know not, nor whether thou wilt be allowed to see  the resurrection of the Lord of glory ... but be not deceived, thou  canst not view Him with the joy of the redeemed.\" \"Yet let me see Him,  let me see him!\"--Klopstock, _The Messiah_, xiii.    ABBERVILLE (_Lord_), a young nobleman, 23 years of age, who has for  travelling tutor a Welshman of 65, called Dr. Druid, an antiquary,  wholly ignorant of his real duties as a guide of youth. The young  man runs wantonly wild, squanders his money, and gives loose to his  passions almost to the verge of ruin, but he is arrested and reclaimed  by his honest Scotch bailiff or financier, and the vigilance of his  father's executor, Mr. Mortimer. This \"fashionable lover\" promises  marriage to a vulgar, malicious city minx named Lucinda Bridgemore,  but is saved from this pitfall also.--Cumberland, _The Fashionable  Lover_ (1780).    ABBOT (_The_), the complacent churchman in Aldrich's poem of _The  Jew's Gift_, who hanged a Jew \"just for no crime,\" and pondered and  smiled and gave consent to the heretic's burial--    \"Since he gave his beard to the birds.\" (1881.)    ABDAL-AZIS, the Moorish governor of Spain after the overthrow of  king Roderick. When the Moor assumed regal state and affected Gothic  sovereignty, his subjects were so offended that they revolted and  murdered him. He married Egilona, formerly the wife of Roderick.--  Southey, _Roderick, etc_., xxii. (1814).    AB'DALAZ'IZ (_Omar ben_), a caliph raised to \"Mahomet's bosom\" in  reward of his great abstinence and self-denial.--_Herbelot_, 690.    He was by no means scrupulous; nor did he think with the caliph Omar  ben Abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to  enjoy paradise in the next.--W. Beckford, _Vathek_ (1786).    ABDAL'DAR, one of the magicians in the Domdaniel caverns, \"under the  roots of the ocean.\" These spirits were destined to be destroyed by  one of the race of Hodei'rah (3 _syl_.), so they persecuted the race  even to death. Only one survived, named Thal'aba, and Abdaldar was  appointed by lot to find him out and kill him. He discovered the  stripling in an Arab's tent, and while in prayer was about to stab him  to the heart with a dagger, when the angel of death breathed on him,  and he fell dead with the dagger in his hand. Thalaba drew from the  magician's finger a ring which gave him command over the spirits.  --Southey, _Thalaba the Destroyer_, ii. iii. (1797).    ABDALLA, one of sir Brian de Bois Guilbert's slaves.--Sir W. Scott,  _Ivanhoe_ (time, Richard I.).    _Abdal'lah_, brother and predecessor of Giaf'fer (2 _syl_.), pacha of  Aby'dos. He was murdered by the pacha.--Byron, _Bride of Abydos_.    ABDALLAH EL HADGI, Saladin's envoy.--Sir W. Scott, _The Talisman_  (t"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#1)"],[1,"WILLOWS    Algernon Blackwood  (1907)        I      After leaving Vienna, and long before you come to Budapest, the Danube  enters a region of singular loneliness and desolation, where its waters  spread away on all sides regardless of a main channel, and the country  becomes a swamp for miles upon miles, covered by a vast sea of low  willow-bushes. On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy  blue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may be  seen in large straggling letters the word Sumpfe, meaning marshes.    In high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grown  islands is almost topped by the water, but in normal seasons the bushes  bend and rustle in the free winds, showing their silver leaves to the  sunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering beauty. These willows never  attain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remain  humble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender stems  that answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as grasses, and so  continually shifting that they somehow give the impression that the entire  plain is moving and alive. For the wind sends waves rising and falling over  the whole surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swells  like the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery white  as their underside turns to the sun.    Happy to slip beyond the control of the stern banks, the Danube here  wanders about at will among the intricate network of channels intersecting  the islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters pour with a  shouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing at  the sandy banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; and  forming new islands innumerably which shift daily in size and shape and  possess at best an impermanent life, since the flood-time obliterates their  very existence.    Properly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life begins soon  after leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian canoe, with gipsy tent and  frying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood about  mid-July. That very same morning, when the sky was reddening before  sunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving it a  couple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills of the  Wienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below Fischeramend under a  grove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on the tearing  current past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman Carnuntum of Marcus  Aurelius), and so under the frowning heights of Thelsen on a spur of the  Carpathians, where the March steals in quietly from the left and the  frontier is crossed between Austria and Hungary.    Racing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into Hungary,  and the muddy waters--sure sign of flood--sent us aground on many a  shingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden belching whirlpool  before the towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Poszony) showed against the sky;  and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse, flew at top speed under  the grey walls, negotiated safely the sunken chain of the Fliegende Brucke  ferry, turned the corner sharply to the left, and plunged on yellow foam  into the wilderness of islands, sandbanks, and swamp-land beyond--the land  of the willows.    The change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps down  on the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the scenery of  lake and forest. We entered the land of desolation on wings, and in less  than half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, nor  any single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight. The  sense of remoteness from the world of humankind, the utter isolation, the  fascination of this singular world of willows, winds, and waters, instantly  laid its spell upon us both, so that we allowed laughingly to one another  that we ought by rights to have held some special kind of passport to admit  us, and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking leave into a  separate little kingdom of wonder and magic--a kingdom that was reserved  for the use of others who had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten  warnings to trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them.    Though still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a most  tempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about for  a suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering character of  the islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in shore  and then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands as we  seized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank into  the water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the wind  into a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. Then we  lay panting and laughing after our exertions on the hot yellow sand,  sheltered from the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, a  cloudless blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willow  bushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and clapping their  thousand little hands as though to applaud the success of our efforts.    \"What a river!\" I said to my companion, thinking of all the way we had  traveled from the source in the Black Forest, and how he had often been  obliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of June.    \"Won't stand much nonsense now, will it?\" he said, pulling the canoe a  little farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for a  nap.    I lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the elements--water,  wind, sand, and the great fire of the sun--thinking of the long journey  that lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us to the Black Sea,  and how lucky I was to have such a delightful and charming traveling  companion as my friend, the Swede.    We had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube, more than any  other river I knew, impressed us from the very beginning with its  aliveness. From its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the pinewood  gardens of Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to play the  great river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps, unobserved,  unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the grown of some living  creature. Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it  became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being,  through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its  mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly  and well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a  Great Personage.    How, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its secret  life? At night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our tent,  uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be caused by  the rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is its hurrying  speed. We knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools, suddenly  bubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its shallows  and swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere surface  sounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at the banks. How it  stood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its face! And how its  laughter roared out when the wind blew up-stream and tried to stop its  growing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices, its tumblings and  foamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges; that  self-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the affected  dignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far too  important to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when the sun  caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steam  rose.    It was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world knew  it. There were places in the upper reaches among the Swabian forests, when  yet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it, where it elected  to disappear through holes in the ground, to appear again on the other side  of the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name;  leaving, too, so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out and  wade and push the canoe through miles of shallows.    And a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth, was  to lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent tributaries  came to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge them when in,  but to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well marked, the very  levels different, the Danube utterly declining to recognize the newcomer.  Below Passau, however, it gave up this particular trick, for there the Inn  comes in with a thundering power impossible to ignore, and so pushes and  incommodes the parent river that there is hardly room for them in the long  twisting gorge that follows, and the Danube is shoved this way and that  against the cliffs, and forced to hurry itself with great waves and much  dashing to and fro in order to get through in time. And during the fight  our canoe slipped down from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time of  its life among the struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river a  lesson, and after Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals.    This was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to know  other aspects of the great creature, and across the Bavarian wheat plain of  Straubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing June sun that we could  well imagine only the surface inches were water, while below there moved,  concealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of Undines,"]]]
