Wallcousins    1912              [Illustration: TYPE OF SHIP SAILED IN BY THE ENGLISH OR FRENCH  PIONEERS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY]          The Pioneer Library    A standard series by Sir Harry Johnston. Tastefully bound.         Pioneers in Australasia.       Pioneers in Canada.       Pioneers in South Africa.       Pioneers in West Africa.       Pioneers in Tropical America.       Pioneers in India.              PREFACE      I have been asked to write a series of works which should deal with  \"real adventures\", in parts of the world either wild and uncontrolled  by any civilized government, or at any rate regions full of dangers,  of wonderful discoveries; in which the daring and heroism of white men  (and sometimes of white women) stood out clearly against backgrounds  of unfamiliar landscapes, peopled with strange nations, savage tribes,  dangerous beasts, or wonderful birds. These books would again and  again illustrate the first coming of the white race into regions  inhabited by people of a different type, with brown, black, or yellow  skins; how the European was received, and how he treated these races  of the soil which gradually came under his rule owing to his superior  knowledge, weapons, wealth, or powers of persuasion. The books were to  tell the plain truth, even if here and there they showed the white man  to have behaved badly, or if they revealed the fact that the American  Indian, the Negro, the Malay, the black Australian was sometimes cruel  and treacherous.    A request thus framed was almost equivalent to asking me to write  stories of those pioneers who founded the British Empire; in any case,  the first volumes of this series do relate the adventures of those who  created the greater part of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, by  their perilous explorations of unknown lands and waters. In many  instances the travellers were all unconscious of their destinies, of  the results which would arise from their actions. In some cases they  would have bitterly railed at Fate had they known that the result of  their splendid efforts was to be the enlargement of an empire under  the British flag. Perhaps if they could know by now that we are  striving under that flag to be just and generous to all types of men,  and not to use our empire solely for the benefit of English-speaking  men and women, the French who founded the Canadian nation, the Germans  and Dutch who helped to create British Africa, Malaysia, and  Australia, the Spaniards who preceded us in the West Indies, and the  Portuguese in West, Central, and East Africa, in Newfoundland and  Ceylon, might--if they have any consciousness or care for things in  this world--be not so sorry after all that we are reaping where they  sowed.    It is (as you will see) impossible to tell the tale of these early  days in the British Dominions beyond the Seas, without describing here  and there the adventures of men of enterprise and daring who were not  of our own nationality. The majority, nevertheless, were of British  stock; that is to say, they were English, Welsh, Scots, Irish, perhaps  here and there a Channel Islander and a Manxman; or Nova Scotians,  Canadians, and New Englanders. The bulk of them were good fellows, a  few were saints, a few were ruffians with redeeming features.  Sometimes they were common men who blundered into great discoveries  which will for ever preserve their names from perishing; occasionally  they were men of Fate, predestined, one might say, to change the  history of the world by their revelations of new peoples, new lands,  new rivers, new lakes, snow mountains, and gold mines. Here and there  is a martyr like Marquette, or Livingstone, or Gordon, dying for the  cause of a race not his own. And others again are mere boys, whose  adventures come to them because they are adventurous, and whose feats  of arms, escapes, perils, and successes are quite as wonderful as  those attributed to the juvenile heroes of Marryat, Stevenson, and the  author of _The Swiss Family Robinson_.    I have tried, in describing these adventures, to give my readers some  idea of the scenery, animals, and vegetation of the new lands through  which these pioneers passed on their great and small purposes; as well  as of the people, native to the soil, with whom they came in contact.  And in treating of these subjects I have thought it best to give the  scientific names of the plant or animal which was of importance in my  story, so that any of my readers who were really interested in natural  history could at once ascertain for themselves the exact type alluded  to, and, if they wished, look it up in a museum, a garden, or a  natural history book.    I hope this attempt at scientific accuracy will not frighten away  readers young and old; and, if you can have patience with the author,  you will, by reading this series of books on the great pioneers of  British West Africa, Canada, Malaysia, West Indies, South Africa, and  Australasia, get a clear idea of how the British Colonial Empire came  to be founded.    You will find that I have often tried to tell the story in the words  of the pioneers, but in these quotations I have adopted the modern  spelling, not only in my transcript of the English original or  translation, but also in the place and tribal names, so as not to  puzzle or delay the reader. Otherwise, if you were to look out some of  the geographical names of the old writers, you might not be able to  recognize them on the modern atlas. The pronunciation of this modern  geographical spelling is very simple and clear: the vowels are  pronounced _a_ = ah, _e_ = eh, _i_ = ee, _o_ = o, _o_ = oh,  _[-o]_ = aw, _oe_ = u in 'hurt', and _u_ = oo, as in German, Italian, or  most other European languages; and the consonants as in English.

The spirants thorn and eth  are represented by _th_ and _d_, as being more familiar to readers  unacquainted with the  original. Marks of vowel-length are in all cases  omitted. The inflexional _-r_ of the nominative singular masculine  is also omitted, whether it appears as _-r_ or is assimilated to a  preceding consonant (as in Odinn, Eysteinn, Heindall, Egill) in the  Norse form, with the single exception of the name Tyr, where I use  the form which has become conventional in English.    Manchester,  December 1901.          The Edda: I. The Divine Mythology of the North      The Icelandic Eddas are the only vernacular record of Germanic  heathendom as it developed during the four centuries which in England  saw the destruction of nearly all traces of the heathen system. The  so-called Elder Edda is a collection of some thirty poems, mythic and  heroic in substance, interspersed with short pieces of prose, which  survives in a thirteenth-century MS., known as the Codex Regius,  discovered in Iceland in 1642; to these are added other poems of  similar character from other sources. The Younger Edda is a prose  paraphrase of, and commentary on, these poems and others which are  lost, together with a treatise on metre, written by the historian  Snorri Sturluson about 1220.    This use of the word Edda is incorrect and unhistorical, though  convenient and sanctioned by the use of several centuries. It was early  used as a general term for the rules and materials for versemaking,  and applied in this sense to Snorri's work. When the poems on which  his paraphrase is founded were discovered, Icelandic scholars by a  misunderstanding applied the name to them also; and as they attributed  the collection quite arbitrarily to the historian Saemund (1056-1133),  it was long known as Saemundar Edda, a name now generally discarded in  favour of the less misleading titles of Elder or Poetic Edda. From its  application to this collection, the word derives a more extended use,  (1) as a general term for Norse mythology; (2) as a convenient name  to distinguish the simpler style of these anonymous narrative poems  from the elaborate formality of the Skalds.    The poems of the Edda are certainly older than the MS., although  the old opinion as to their high antiquity is untenable. The majority  probably date from the tenth century in their present form; this dating  does not necessitate the ascription of the shape in which the legends  are presented, still less of their substance, to that period. With  regard to the place of their composition opinions vary widely,  Norway, the British Isles and Greenland having all found champions;  but the evidence is rather questionable, and I incline to leave  them to the country which has preserved them. They are possibly of  popular origin; this, together with their epic or narrative character,  would account for the striking absence from them of some of the chief  characteristics of Skaldic poetry: the obscuring of the sense by the  elaborate interlacing of sentences and the extensive use of kennings  or mythological synonyms, and the complication of the metre by such  expedients as the conjunction of end-rhyme with alliteration. Eddie  verse is governed solely by the latter, and the strophic arrangement  is simple, only two forms occurring: (1) couplets of alliterative  short lines; (2) six-line strophes, consisting of a couplet followed  by a single short line, the whole repeated.    Roughly speaking, the first two-fifths of the MS. is mythological,  the rest heroic. I propose to observe this distinction, and to  deal in this study with the stories of the Gods. In this connexion,  Snorri's Edda and the mythical Ynglinga Saga may also be considered,  but as both were compiled a couple of centuries or more after the  introduction of Christianity into Iceland, it is uncertain how much in  them is literary explanation of tradition whose meaning was forgotten;  some also, especially in Snorri, is probably pure invention, fairy  tale rather than myth.    Many attempts have been made to prove that the material of the Edda  is largely borrowed. The strength and distinction of Icelandic poetry  rest rather on the fact that it is original and national and, like  that of Greece, owes little to foreign sources; and that it began in  the heathen age, before Christian or Romantic influences had touched  Iceland. Valuable as the early Christian poetry of England is, we look  in vain there for the humour, the large-minded simplicity of motive,  the suggestive character-drawing, the swift dramatic action, which  are as conspicuous in many poems in the Edda as in many of the Sagas.    Omitting the heroic poems, there are in Codex Regius the following: (1)  Of a more or less comprehensive character, _Voeluspa, Vafthrudnismal,  Grimnismal, Lokasenna, Harbardsljod_; (2) dealing with episodes,  _Hymiskvida, Thrymskvida, Skirnisfoer. Havamal_ is a collection  of proverbs, but contains two interpolations from mythical  poems; _Alvissmal_, which, in the form of a dialogue between  Thor and a dwarf Alviss, gives a list of synonyms, is a kind of  mythologico-poetical glossary. Several of these poems are found  in another thirteenth-century vellum fragment, with an additional  one, variously styled _Vegtamskvida_ or _Baldr's Dreams_; the great  fourteenth-century codex Flateybook contains _Hyndluljod_, partly  genealogical, partly an imitation of _Voeluspa_; and one of the MSS. of  Snorri's Edda gives us _Rigsthula_.    _Voeluspa_, though not one of the earliest poems, forms an appropriate  opening. Metrical considerations forbid an earlier date than the  first quarter of the eleventh century, and the last few lines are  still later. The material is, however, older: the poem is an outline,  in allusions often obscure to us, of traditions and beliefs familiar to  its first hearers. The very bareness of the outline is sufficient proof  that the material is not new. The framework is apparently imitated from  that of the poem known as _Baldr's Dreams_, some lines from which are  inserted in _Voeluspa_. This older poem describes Odin's visit to the  Sibyl in hell-gates to inquire into the future. He rides down to her  tomb at the eastern door of Nifl-hell and chants spells, until she  awakes and asks: \"What man unknown to me is that, who has troubled me  with this weary journey? Snow has snowed on me, rain has beaten me,  dew has drenched me, I have long been dead.\" He gives the name Wegtam,  or Way-wise, and then follow question and answer until she discovers  his identity and will say no more. In _Voeluspa_ there is no descriptive  introduction, and no dialogue; the whole is spoken by the Sibyl,  who plunges at once into her story, with only the explanatory words:  \"Thou, Valfather, wouldst have me tell the ancient histories of men as  far as I remember.\" She describes the creation of the world and sky  by Bor's sons; the building by the Gods of a citadel in Ida-plain,  and their age of innocence till three giant-maids brought greed of  gold; the creation of the dwarfs; the creation of the first man and  woman out of two trees by Odin, Hoeni and Lodur; the world-ash and  the spring beside it where dwell the three Norns who order the fates  of men. Then follows an allusion to the war between the Aesir and the  Vanir, the battle with the giants who had got possession of the goddess  Freyja, and the breaking of bargains; an obscure reference to Mimi's  spring where Odin left his eye as a pledge; and an enumeration of his  war-maids or Valkyries. Turning to the future, the Sibyl prophesies  the death of Baldr, the vengeance on his slayer, and the chaining of  Loki, the doom of the Gods and the destruction of the world at the  coming of the fire-giants and the release of Loki's children from  captivity. The rest of the poem seems to be later; it tells how the  earth shall rise again from the deep, and the Aesir dwell once more  in Odin's halls, and there is a suggestion of Christian influence in  it which is absent from the earlier part.    Of the other general poems, the next four were probably composed before  950; in each the setting is different. _Vafthrudnismal_, a riddle-poem,  shows Odin in a favourite position, seeking in disguise for knowledge  of the future. Under the name of Gangrad (Wanderer), he visits the  wise giant Vafthrudni, and the two agree to test their wisdom: the one  who fails to answer a question is to forfeit his head. In each case  the questions deal first with the past. Vafthrudni asks about Day and  Night, and the river which divides the Giants from the Gods, matters of  common knowledge; and then puts a question as to the future: \"What is  the plain where Surt and the blessed Gods shall meet in battle?\" Odin  replies, and proceeds to question in his turn; first about the creation  of Earth and Sky, the origin of Sun and Moon, Winter and Summer, the  Giants and the Winds; the coming of Njoerd the Wane to the Aesir as  a hostage; the Einherjar, or chosen warriors of Valhalla. Then come  prophetic questions on the destruction of the Sun by the wolf Fenri,  the Gods who shall rule in the new world after Ragnaroek, the end of  Odin. The poem is brought to a close by Odin's putting the question  which only himself can answer: \"What did Odin say in his son's ear  before he mounted the pyre?\" and the giant's head is forfeit.    In the third poem of this class, _Grimnismal_, a prose introduction  relates that Odin and Frigg quarrelled over the merits of their  respective foster-children.
