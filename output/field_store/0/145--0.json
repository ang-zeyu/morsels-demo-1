Philippine Folk Tales    Compiled and Annotated by    Mabel Cook Cole      1916        PREFACE      From time to time since the American occupation of the Islands,  Philippine folk-tales have appeared in scientific publications, but  never, so far as the writer is aware, has there been an attempt to  offer to the general public a comprehensive popular collection of  this material. It is my earnest hope that this collection of tales  will give those who are interested opportunity to learn something  of the magic, superstitions, and weird customs of the Filipinos,  and to feel the charm of their wonder-world as it is pictured by  these dark-skinned inhabitants of our Island possessions.    In company with my husband, who was engaged in ethnological work for  the Field Museum of Natural History, it was my good fortune to spend  four years among the wild tribes of the Philippines, During this  time we frequently heard these stories, either related by the people  in their homes and around the camp fires or chanted by the pagan  priests in communion with the spirits. The tales are now published  in this little volume, with the addition of a few folk-legends  that have appeared in the _Journal of American Folk-Lore_ and in  scientific publications, here retold with some additions made by  native story-tellers.    I have endeavored to select typical tales from tribes widely separated  and varying in culture from savagery to a rather high degree of  development. The stories are therefore divided into five groups,  as follows: Tinguian, Igorot, the Wild Tribes of Mindanao, Moro,  and Christian,    The first two groups, Tinguian and Igorot, are from natives who  inhabit the rugged mountain region of northwestern Luzon. From time  immemorial they have been zealous head-hunters, and the stories teem  with references to customs and superstitions connected with their  savage practices. By far the largest number belong to the Tinguian  group. In order to appreciate these tales to the fullest extent,  we must understand the point of view of the Tinguian. To him they  embody all the known traditions of \"the first times\"--of the people  who inhabited the earth before the present race appeared, of the  ancient heroes and their powers and achievements. In them he finds  an explanation of and reason for many of his present laws and customs.    A careful study of the whole body of Tinguian mythology points to  the conclusion that the chief characters of these tales are not  celestial beings but typical, generalized heroes of former ages,  whose deeds have been magnified in the telling by many generations  of their descendants. These people of \"the first times\" practiced  magic. They talked with jars, created human beings out of betel-nuts,  raised the dead, and had the power of changing themselves into other  forms. This, however, does not seem strange or impossible to the  Tinguian of today, for even now they talk with jars, perform certain  rites to bring sickness and death to their foes, and are warned by  omens received through the medium of birds, thunder and lightning,  or the condition of the liver of a slaughtered animal. They still  converse freely with certain spirits who during religious ceremonies  are believed to use the bodies of men or women as mediums for the  purpose of advising and instructing the people.    Several of the characters appear in story after story. Sometimes they  go under different names, but in the minds of the story-tellers their  personality and relationships are definitely established. Thus Ini-init  of the first tale becomes Kadayadawan in the second, Aponitolau in  the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, and Ligi in the seventh. Kanag,  the son of Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen, in the fifth tale is called  Dumalawi.    These heroes had most unusual relations with the heavenly bodies,  all of which seem to have been regarded as animate beings. In the  fourth tale Aponitolau marries Gaygayoma, the star maiden who is  the daughter of the big star and the moon. In the first story the  same character under the name of Ini-init seems to be a sun-god:  we are told that he is \"the sun,\" and again \"a round stone which  rolls.\" Thereupon we might conclude that he is a true solar being;  yet in the other tales of this collection and in many more known to  the Tinguian he reveals no celestial qualities. Even in the first  story he abandons his place in the sky and goes to live on earth.    In the first eight stories we read of many customs of \"the first  times\" which differ radically from those of the present. But a careful  analysis of all the known lore of this people points to the belief that  many of these accounts depict a period when similar customs did exist  among the people, or else were practiced by emigrants who generations  ago became amalgamated with the Tinguian and whose strange customs  finally became attributed to the people of the tales. The stories  numbered nine to sixteen are of a somewhat different type, and in  them the Tinguian finds an explanation of many things, such as,  how the people learned to plant, and to cure diseases, where they  secured the valuable jars and beads, and why the moon has spots on  its face. All these stories are fully believed, the beads and jars  are considered precious, and the places mentioned are definitely  known. While the accounts seem to be of fairly recent origin they  conflict neither with the fundamental ideas and traditions of \"the  first times\" nor with the beliefs of today.    Stories seventeen to twenty-three are regarded as fables and are told  to amuse the children or to while away the midday hours when the people  seek shaded spots to lounge or stop on the trail to rest. Most of  them are known to the Christianized tribes throughout the Islands and  show great similarity to the tales found in the islands to the south  and, in some cases, in Europe. In many of them the chief incidents  are identical with those found elsewhere, but the story-tellers, by  introducing old customs and beliefs, have moulded and colored them  until they reflect the common ideas of the Tinguian.    The third group includes stories from several wild tribes who dwell  in the large island of Mindanao. Here are people who work in brass  and steel, build good dwellings, and wear hemp clothing elaborately  decorated with beads, shell disks, and embroidery, but who still  practice many savage customs, including slavery and human sacrifice.    The fourth division gives two tales from the Moro (hardy Malayan  warriors whose ancestors early became converts to the faith of  Mohammed). Their teachers were the Arabian traders who, about 1400,  succeeded in converting many of the Malay Islanders to the faith of  the prophet.    The last group contains the stories of the Christianized natives--those  who accepted the rule of Spain and with it the Catholic religion. Their  tales, while full of local color, nevertheless show the influence  of the European tutors. They furnish an excellent opportunity to  contrast the literature of the savage head-hunters with that of the  Moro and Christian tribes and to observe how various recent influences  have modified the beliefs of people who not many centuries ago were  doubtless of a uniform grade of culture. It is interesting, too, to  note that European tales brought into the Islands by Mohammedan and  Christian rulers and traders have been worked over until, at first  glance, they now appear indigenous.    Owing to local coloring, these tales have various forms. Still we  find many incidents which are held in common by all the tribes of  the Archipelago and even by the people of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and  India. Some of these similarities and parallelisms are indicated in  the foot-notes throughout the book.

ADAPTED TO THIS COUNTRY,  AND ALL GRADES OF LIFE.      By Amelia Simmons,  AN AMERICAN ORPHAN.      PUBLISHED ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS.      _HARTFORD_  PRINTED BY HUDSON & GOODWIN,  FOR THE AUTHOR.    1796      PREFACE.    As this treatise is calculated for the improvement of the rising  generation of _Females_ in America, the Lady of fashion and fortune  will not be displeased, if many hints are suggested for the more  general and universal knowledge of those females in this country, who  by the loss of their parents, or other unfortunate circumstances, are  reduced to the necessity of going into families in the line of  domestics, or taking refuge with their friends or relations, and doing  those things which are really essential to the perfecting them as good  wives, and useful members of society. The orphan, tho' left to the  care of virtuous guardians, will find it essentially necessary to have  an opinion and determination of her own. The world, and the fashion  thereof, is so variable, that old people cannot accommodate themselves  to the various changes and fashions which daily occur; _they_ will  adhere to the fashion of _their_ day, and will not surrender their  attachments to the _good old way_--while the young and the gay, bend  and conform readily to the taste of the times, and fancy of the hour.  By having an opinion and determination, I would not be understood to  mean an obstinate perseverance in trifles, which borders on  obstinacy--by no means, but only an adherence to those rules and  maxims which have flood the test of ages, and will forever establish  the _female character_, a virtuous character--altho' they conform to  the ruling taste of the age in cookery, dress, language, manners, &c.    It must ever remain a check upon the poor solitary orphan, that while  those females who have parents, or brothers, or riches, to defend  their indiscretions, that the orphan must depend solely upon  _character_. How immensely important, therefore, that every action,  every word, every thought, be regulated by the strictest purity, and  that every movement meet the approbation of the good and wise.    The candor of the American Ladies is solicitously intreated by the  Authoress, as she is circumscribed in her knowledge, this being an  original work in this country. Should any future editions appear, she  hopes to render it more valuable.    [Illustration]      DIRECTIONS for CATERING, or the procuring the best VIANDS, FISH, &c.    _How to choose Flesh_.    BEEF. The large stall fed ox beef is the best, it has a coarse open  grain, and oily smoothness; dent it with your finger and it will  immediately rise again; if old, it will be rough and spungy, and the  dent remain.    Cow Beef is less boned, and generally more tender and juicy than the  ox, in America, which is used to labor.    Of almost every species of Animals, Birds and Fishes, the female is  the tenderest, the richest flavour'd, and among poultry the soonest  fattened.    _Mutton_, grass-fed, is good two or three years old.    _Lamb_, if under six months is rich, and no danger of imposition; it  may be known by its size, in distinguishing either.    _Veal_, is soon lost--great care therefore is necessary in purchasing.  Veal bro't to market in panniers, or in carriages, is to be prefered  to that bro't in bags, and flouncing on a sweaty horse.    _Pork_, is known by its size, and whether properly fattened by its  appearance.      _To make the best Bacon_.    To each ham put one ounce saltpetre, one pint bay salt, one pint  molasses, shake together 6 or 8 weeks, or when a large quantity is  together, bast them with the liquor every day; when taken out to dry,  smoke three weeks with cobs or malt fumes. To every ham may be added a  cheek, if you stow away a barrel and not alter the composition, some  add a shoulder. For transportation or exportation, double the period  of smoaking.      _Fish, how to choose the best in market_.    _Salmon_, the noblest and richest fish taken in fresh water--the  largest are the best. They are unlike almost every other fish, are  ameliorated by being 3 or 4 days out of water, if kept from heat and  the moon, which has much more injurious effect than the sun.    In all great fish-markets, great fish-mongers strictly examine the  gills--if the bright redness is exchanged for a low brown, they are  stale; but when live fish are bro't flouncing into market, you have  only to elect the kind most agreeable to your palate and the season.    _Shad_, contrary to the generally received opinion are not so much  richer flavored, as they are harder when first taken out of the water;  opinions vary respecting them. I have tasted Shad thirty or forty  miles from the place where caught, and really conceived that they had  a richness of flavor, which did not appertain to those taken fresh and  cooked immediately, and have proved both at the same table, and the  truth may rest here, that a Shad 36 or 48 hours out of water, may not  cook so hard and solid, and be esteemed so elegant, yet give a higher  relished flavor to the taste.    Every species generally of _salt water Fish_, are best fresh from the  water, tho' the _Hannah Hill, Black Fish, Lobster, Oyster, Flounder,  Bass, Cod, Haddock_, and _Eel_, with many others, may be transported  by land many miles, find a good market, and retain a good relish; but  as generally, live ones are bought first, deceits are used to give  them a freshness of appearance, such as peppering the gills, wetting  the fins and tails, and even painting the gills, or wetting with  animal blood. Experience and attention will dictate the choice of the  best. Fresh gills, full bright eyes, moist fins and tails, are  denotements of their being fresh caught; if they are soft, its certain  they are stale, but if deceits are used, your smell must approve or  denounce them, and be your safest guide.    Of all fresh water fish, there are none that require, or so well  afford haste in cookery, as the _Salmon Trout_, they are best when  caught under a fall or cateract--from what philosophical circumstance  is yet unsettled, yet true it is, that at the foot of a fall the  waters are much colder than at the head; Trout choose those waters; if  taken from them and hurried into dress, they are genuinely good; and  take rank in point of superiority of flavor, of most other fish.    _Perch and Roach_, are noble pan fish, the deeper the water from  whence taken, the finer are their flavors; if taken from shallow  water, with muddy bottoms, they are impregnated therewith, and are  unsavory.    _Eels_, though taken from muddy bottoms, are best to jump in the pan.    Most white or soft fish are best bloated, which is done by salting,  peppering, and drying in the sun, and in a chimney; after 30 or 40  hours drying, are best broiled, and moistened with butter, &c.      _Poultry--how to choose_.    Having before stated that the female in almost every instance, is  preferable to the male, and peculiarly so in the _Peacock_, which,  tho' beautifully plumaged, is tough, hard, stringy, and untasted, and  even indelicious--while the _Pea Hen_ is exactly otherwise, and the  queen of all birds.    So also in a degree, _Turkey_.    _Hen Turkey_, is higher and richer flavor'd, easier fattened and  plumper--they are no odds in market.    _Dunghill Fowls_, are from their frequent use, a tolerable proof of  the former birds.    _Chickens_, of either kind are good, and the yellow leg'd the best,  and their taste the sweetest.    _Capons_, if young are good, are known by short spurs and smooth legs.    All birds are known, whether fresh killed or stale, by a tight vent in  the former, and a loose open vent if old or stale; their smell denotes  their goodness; speckled rough legs denote age, while smooth legs and  combs prove them young.    _A Goose_, if young, the bill will be yellow, and will have but few  hairs, the bones will crack easily; but if old, the contrary, the bill  will be red, and the pads still redder; the joints stiff and  difficultly disjointed; if young, otherwise; choose one not very  fleshy on the breast, but fat in the rump.    _Ducks_, are similar to geese.    _Wild Ducks_, have redder pads, and smaller than the tame ones,  otherwise are like the goose or tame duck, or to be chosen by the same  rules.    _Wood Cocks_, ought to be thick, fat and flesh firm, the nose dry, and  throat clear.    _Snipes_, if young and fat, have full veins under the wing, and are  small in the veins, otherwise like the Woodcock.    _Partridges_, if young, will have black bills, yellowish legs; if old,  the legs look bluish; if old or stale, it may be perceived by smelling  at their mouths.    _Pigeons_, young, have light red legs, and the flesh of a colour, and  prick easily--old have red legs, blackish in parts, more hairs,  plumper and loose vents--so also of grey or green Plover, Blade Birds,  Thrash, Lark, and wild Fowl in general.      _Hares_, are white flesh'd and flexible when new and fresh kill'd; if  stale, their flesh will have a blackish hue, like old pigeons, if the  cleft in her lip spread much, is wide and ragged, she is old; the  contrary when young.    _Leveret_, is like the Hare in every respect, that some are obliged to  search for the knob, or small bone on the fore leg or foot, to  distinguish them.    _Rabbits_, the wild are the best, either are good and tender; if old  there will be much yellowish fat about the kidneys, the claws long,  wool rough, and mixed with grey hairs; if young the reverse. As to  their being fresh, judge by the scent, they soon perish, if trap'd or  shot, and left in pelt or undressed; their taint is"]]]
