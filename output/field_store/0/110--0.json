A Scientific Treatise on Food Substances and Their Dietetic Properties,  together with a Practical Explanation of the Principles of Healthful  Cookery, and a Large Number of Original, Palatable, and Wholesome Recipes.    by    MRS. E. E. KELLOGG, A.M.    Superintendent of the Sanitarium School of Cookery and of the Bay View  Assembly School of Cookery, and Chairman of the World's Fair Committee  on Food Supplies, for Michigan    1893                PREFACE.    The interest in scientific cookery, particularly in cookery as related  to health, has manifestly increased in this country within the last  decade as is evidenced by the success which has attended every  intelligent effort for the establishment of schools for instruction in  cookery in various parts of the United States. While those in charge of  these schools have presented to their pupils excellent opportunities for  the acquirement of dexterity in the preparation of toothsome and  tempting viands, but little attention has been paid to the science of  dietetics, or what might be termed the hygiene of cookery.    A little less than ten years ago the Sanitarium at Battle Creek Mich.,  established an experimental kitchen and a school of cookery under the  supervision of Mrs. Dr. Kellogg, since which time, researches in the  various lines of cookery and dietetics have been in constant progress in  the experimental kitchen, and regular sessions of the school of cookery  have been held. The school has gradually gained in popularity, and the  demand for instruction has become so great that classes are in session  during almost the entire year.    During this time, Mrs. Kellogg has had constant oversight of the cuisine  of both the Sanitarium and the Sanitarium Hospital, preparing bills of  fare for the general and diet tables, and supplying constantly new  methods and original recipes to meet the changing and growing demands of  an institution numbering always from 500 to 700 inmates.    These large opportunities for observation, research, and experience,  have gradually developed a system of cookery, the leading features of  which are so entirely novel and so much in advance of the methods  heretofore in use, that it may be justly styled, _A New System of  Cookery_. It is a singular and lamentable fact, the evil consequences of  which are wide-spread, that the preparation of food, although involving  both chemical and physical processes, has been less advanced by the  results of modern researches and discoveries in chemistry and physics,  than any other department of human industry. Iron mining, glass-making,  even the homely art of brick-making, and many of the operations of the  farm and the dairy, have been advantageously modified by the results of  the fruitful labors of modern scientific investigators. But the art of  cookery is at least a century behind in the march of scientific  progress. The mistress of the kitchen is still groping her way amid the  uncertainties of mediaeval methods, and daily bemoaning the sad results  of the \"rule of thumb.\" The chemistry of cookery is as little known to  the average housewife as were the results of modern chemistry to the old  alchemists; and the attempt to make wholesome, palatable, and  nourishing food by the methods commonly employed, is rarely more  successful than that of those misguided alchemists in transmuting lead  and copper into silver and gold.    The new cookery brings order from out the confusion of mixtures and  messes, often incongruence and incompatible, which surrounds the average  cook, by the elucidation of the principles which govern the operations  of the kitchen, with the same certainty with which the law of gravity  rules the planets.    Those who have made themselves familiar with Mrs. Kellogg's system of  cookery, invariably express themselves as trebly astonished: first, at  the simplicity of the methods employed; secondly, at the marvelous  results both as regards palatableness, wholesomeness, and  attractiveness; thirdly, that it had never occurred to them \"to do this  way before.\"    This system does not consist simply of a rehash of what is found in  every cook book, but of new methods, which are the result of the  application of the scientific principles of chemistry and physics to the  preparation of food in such a manner as to make it the most nourishing,  the most digestible, and the most inviting to the eye and to the palate.    Those who have tested the results of Mrs. Kellogg's system of cookery at  the Sanitarium tables, or in their own homes through the instruction of  her pupils, have been most enthusiastic in their expressions of  satisfaction and commendation. Hundreds of original recipes which have  appeared in her department in _Good Health_, \"Science in the Household\",  have been copied into other journals, and are also quite largely  represented in the pages of several cook books which have appeared  within the last few years.    The great success which attended the cooking school in connection with  the Bay View Assembly (the Michigan Chautauqua), as well as the uniform  success which has met the efforts of many of the graduates of the  Sanitarium school of cookery who have undertaken to introduce the new  system through the means of cooking classes in various parts of the  United States, has created a demand for a fuller knowledge of the  system.    This volume is the outgrowth of the practical and experimental work, and  the popular demand above referred to. Its preparation has occupied the  entire leisure time of the author during the last five or six years. No  pains or expense has been spared to render the work authoritative on all  questions upon which it treats, and in presenting it to the public, the  publishers feel the utmost confidence that the work will meet the  highest expectations of those who have waited impatiently for its  appearance during the months which have elapsed since its preparation  was first announced.
