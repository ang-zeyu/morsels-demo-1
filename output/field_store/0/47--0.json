IV.    GRAMMAR OF THE MUTSUN LANGUAGE,    SPOKEN AT THE MISSION OF SAN JUAN BAUTISTA, ALTA CALIFORNIA.    BY FATHER FELIPE ARROYO DE LA CUESTA,    OF THE ORDER OF ST. FRANCIS.        1861        EXTRACTO    DE LA    GRAMATICA MUTSUN,    O DE LA LENGUA DE LOS NATURALES DE LA    MISION DE SAN JUAN BAUTISTA,    COMPUESTA    POR EL REV. PADRE FRAY FELIPE ARROYO    DE LA CUESTA,    DEL ORDEN SERAFICO DE N.P. SAN FRANCISCO, MINISTRO    DE DICHA MISION EN 1816.           *       *       *       *       *    NUEVA-YORK.    1861.              PREFACE           *       *       *       *       *    The accompanying volume is printed exactly from a manuscript of 76  pages, small quarto, belonging to the College of Santa Inez, by whose  president it was, at the suggestion of A.S. Taylor, Esq., forwarded to  the Smithsonian Institution.    The Mutsunes were the Indians among whom the mission of San Juan  Bautista was planted, June 24, 1799. Their village lay in the centre of  a valley, with abundance of rich land, and as late as 1831 numbered 1200  souls. The mission is about 40 miles northwest from Monterey, and they  are thus the most northerly tribe, of whose language, to our knowledge,  the Spanish missionaries compiled a grammar. For purposes of comparison  this little work, accordingly, possesses great value, as the language  was one of considerable extent, covering, according to Mr. Taylor's  estimate, a district one hundred and seventy miles long by eighty broad.    The late W.W. Turner, who examined the work, says in a brief notice  addressed to the Historical Magazine (vol. 1, p. 206): \"The Mutsun  language is clearly the same with the _Rumsen_ or _Runsien_ (the  Achastlian of De la Manon); one of the two spoken at the mission of San  Carlos, and with that of the mission of La Soledad, further to the  south. A considerable degree of resemblance appears also in the language  of the _Olhones_ (or _Costanos_) on the Bay of San Francisco; and a  fainter one further north in the San Rafael, and also in the _Olamentke_  or _Bodegan_ language.\"    On the cover of the manuscript is the following note, of considerable  importance in instituting comparisons: \"Copia de la lengua Mutsun en  estilo Catalan a causa la escribio un Catalan. La Castellana usa de la  fuerza de la pronunciacion de letras de otro modo en sa alfabeto. Ve el  original intitulado Gramatica California.\" The Catalans pronounce _ch_  hard and _j_ like the Germans.    Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta was then, it would seem, a Catalan. He  came to California, it is said, about 1810, and was for many years  missionary at San Juan Bautista. About 1830 he had, however, become very  infirm and broken in health, yet then new troubles came, and in the  political changes, which struck a death blow to the missions, the aged  missionary was driven from one refuge to another, still apparently  continuing his literary labor. He finally died at the mission of Santa  Inez in 1842.       J.G.S.          INTRODUCCION    A LA    GRAMATICA MUTSUN.           *       *       *       *       *    Al Idioma de estos Indios, le faltan las letras siguientes: _b, d, k, f,  r_, fuerte, _v_ consonante, y _x_.          CAPITULO I.    De la Analogia, o partes de la Oracion.      De las Declinaciones del Nombre Substantivo.    Las Declinaciones de los nombres substantivos son tantas como  terminaciones tienen los mismos Nombres: unos acaban en _es_, como  _eyes_; otros en _an_, como _anan_; otros en _ec_, como _irec_; otros  en _us_, como _rus_; otros en _a_, como _rina_; otros en _el_, como  _mogel_; otros en _ag_, como _rag_; otros en _o_, como _coro_; otros  en _ar_, como _sacar_; otros en _or_, como _por_; otros en _oi_, como  _jocoi_; otros en _ur_, como _juppur_; otros en _os_, como _jorcos_:  y asi otros nombres con otras terminaciones irreducibles por ahora a  numero determinado. Mas porque tengan tantas, y tan diversas  terminaciones, no por eso dexan de poderse declinar gramaticalmente  todos los nombres que llamamos Substantivos, aunque sin articulos, o  signo pronominal _el_, _la_, _lo_, o _hic_, _haec_, _hoc_, como se dice  en latin: por esto en los substantivos no se pone, ni se dice, _eyes_,  la barba, sino barba; _anan_, la madre, sino madre; _irec_, piedra;  _rus_, saliva; _rina_, raton: _mogel_, cabeza; _rag_, piojo; _coro_,  pies; _sacar_, liendre; _por_, pulga; _jocoi_, sarna; _juppur_, divieso;  y _jorcos_, pescuezo: porque este idioma carece de nuestros articulos  gramaticales; y de consiguiente de los generos masculino, femenino,  y neutro.    La variacion de la voz que se hace por los casos con distinta  terminacion se llama _Declinacion_, porque se aparta de la terminacion  del 1^o: v.g.; _musa_, _musae_, _musam_, &c., como se ensena en la  Gramatica latina; o bien en la Castellana, con los articulos v.g.:  _el Senor_, _del Senor_, _para_, o _al Senor_, &c. Mas como esta  lengua no tiene articulos ni cierto numero de declinaciones, esto es,  terminaciones fixas que por donde va un nombre substantivo vaya otro  igual, es preciso discurrir como se forman, y que casos tiene esta  lengua sin poner 1^a. _Declinacion_, 2^a, 3^a, &c, sino solamente  establecer el Nominativo, Genitivo, Dativo, Acusativo, Vocativo,  y Ablativo, de singular y plural, de todos los nombres substantivos  de esta lengua Mutsun y es de este modo:    SINGULAR.      Nom. v.g.  _Appa_,                 El Padre natural.    Gen.       _Appa_,                 Del Padre.    Dat.       _Appahuas_,             Para el Padre, &c.    Acus.      _Appase_,               (Mas adelante se explicara).    Voc.       _Appa_.    Abla.      _Appatsu_, o _Appame_, _o Appatca_.    PLURAL.      Nom.       _Appagma_,              Los Padres.    Gen.       _Appagma_,              De los Padres.    Dat.       _Appagmahuas_,          Para los Padres, &c. (Tambien                                         se explicare mas adelante.)    Acu.       _Apagamase_.    Voc.       _Appagma_.    Abla.      _Appagmatsu_, o _Appagmane_, o _Appamatca_.      Otro exemplo.    SINGULAR.      N.         _Anan_,                 La Madre natural.    G.         _Anan_,                 De la Madre.    D.         _Ananhuas_,             Para la Madre, &c. (que se notara).    Acus.      _Ananne_.    V.         _Anan_.    Abla.      _Anantsu_, o _Ananme_, o _Anantac_.                 PLURAL.      N.         _Ananmac_.    G.         _Ananmac_.    D.         _Ananmancuas_.    Acus.      _Ananmase_.    Voc.       _Ananmac_.    Abla.      _Ananmactsu_, o _Ananmacne_, o _Ananmatca_.      Segun estos exemplos vemos que se pueden declinar los nombres  substantivos de este Idioma por los casos que tiene nuestro Castellano,  y el Latin. Mas hemos de advertir que toda declinacion se ha de  considerar en quanto a la terminacion, o voz, y en quanto al modo  de significar la cosa, y asi aunque el Nom, Gen, y Voc, suenan  materialmente lo mismo, se apartan entre si en quanto al modo de la  recta y formal significacion de la cosa; y por esto se ha de atender al  sentido de la Oracion, y entonces se conoce si es Nom^o, Gen^o, &c., segun  la parte que rija dichos casos. Segun los exemplos puestos arriba se  pueden declinar todos los nombres substantivos, sean de cosas animadas o  inanimadas, con esta diferencia, que los declinables de cosas animadas,  en todos los casos, siempre se forman como arriba dixe; el Nom^o es como  suena la voz en singular, v.g.: ?Como se dice Muger? pregunto a un  Indio.--_Mucurma_, responde. Pues esta voz, _Mucurma_ es Nom^o y raiz  para todos los casos; y asi diremos en singular:      Nom^o      _Mucurma_.              PLURAL: _Mucurmacma_.    Gen^o      _Mucurma_.              &c.    Dat^o      _Mucurmahuas_.        { Nota: No todos los nombres                                     { tienen _Plural_.    Acus^o     _Mucurmase_.    Voc^o      _Mucurma_.    Ablat^o    _Mucurmatsu_, o _Mucurmame_, o _Mucurmatca_.      Nominativo, Genitivo, y Vocativo suenan de un mismo modo, esto es,  tienen una misma terminacion; el Dativo tiene _huas_; el Acusativo _se_,  y algunos _e_, y otros _ne_; y el Ablativo tiene _tsu, me_, y _ca_, o  _tac_, segun finalizen las palabras: el Ablativo tambien acaba en _sum_,  en _um_, y en _ium_, como se vera en los exemplos, y se advertira en  quantas ocasiones se hable en Ablativo con preposicion pospuesta,  o posposicion, la que siempre acompana a los casos Dativo, Acusativo,  y Ablativo de que se infiere que este Idioma es pospositivo, y no  prepositivo. La posposicion _huas, gua_ o _cuas_, de los Dativos  significa _a el_, o _lo_, y tambien _para el, para la, para lo_. La  posposicion _se_ o _e_, de los Acusativos equivale _a los, a las_, de  nuestro Castellano. El _tsu_ de Ablativo significa _con_: el _me_ unas  veces _en_, y otras veces, _en casa_, o _con_: el _tac_, y el _tca_ es  lo mismo que _en_: el _ium_, el _sum_, y el _um_, significan _con_  y _de_, segun los verbos que rijan la oracion. Exemplo de todo esto,  y servira tambien para entender nuestra preposicion pospuesta, o las  posposiciones de esta lengua.      Nom^o        _Mucurma guate_,      Muger viene, o la Muger viene.    Gen^o     { _Attenane utsel?_      De quien es esta arracada.              { _Mucurmane utsel_,     De la Muger es esta arracada.    Dat^o     { _Attehuas?_            Para quien, o a quien?              { _Murcurmahuas_,        Para la Muger, o a la Muger.    Acus^o      _Can jaguei Murcumase_, Yo cierro la Muger.    Voc^o       _Ayi, Mucurma_,        Ven, Muger.    Abl^o     { _Otso Mucurmatsu_,     Vete con la Muger.              { _Otso Mucurmame_,      Vete a casa de la Muger.

CHAPTER I      \"LA-A-A-DIES AN' GEN'L'MUN\"    All through the exhibition the two sat unmoved; yet on the whole it was  the best Wild West show that ever stirred sawdust in Madison Square  Garden and it brought thunders of applause from the crowded house. Even  if the performance could not stir these two, at least the throng of  spectators should have drawn them, for all New York was there, from the  richest to the poorest; neither the combined audiences of a seven-day  race, a prize-fight, or a community singing festival would make such a  cosmopolitan assembly.    All Manhattan came to look at the men who had lived and fought and  conquered under the limitless skies of the Far West, free men, wild  men--one of their shrill whoops banished distance and brought the  mountain desert into the very heart of the unromantic East.  Nevertheless from all these thrills these two men remained immune.    To be sure the smaller tilted his head back when the horses first swept  in, and the larger leaned to watch when Diaz, the wizard with the  lariat, commenced to whirl his rope; but in both cases their interest  held no longer than if they had been old vaudevillians watching a series  of familiar acts dressed up with new names.    The smaller, brown as if a thousand fierce suns and winds had tanned and  withered him, looked up at last to his burly companion with a faint  smile.    \"They're bringing on the cream now, Drew, but I'm going to spoil the  dessert.\"    The other was a great, grey man whom age apparently had not weakened but  rather settled and hardened into an ironlike durability; the winds of  time or misfortune would have to break that stanch oak before it would  bend.    He said: \"We've half an hour before our train leaves. Can you play your  hand in that time?\"    \"Easy. Look at 'em now--the greatest gang of liars that never threw a  diamond hitch! Ride? I've got a ten-year kid home that would laugh at  'em all. But I'll show 'em up. Want to know my little stunt?\"    \"I'll wait and enjoy the surprise.\"    The wild riders who provoked the scorn of the smaller man were now  gathering in the central space; a formidable crew, long of hair and  brilliant as to bandannas, while the announcer thundered through his  megaphone:    \"La-a-a-dies and gen'l'mun! You see before you the greatest band of  subduers and breakers of wild horses that ever rode the cattle ranges.  Death defying, reckless, and laughing at peril, they have never failed;  they have never pulled leather. I present 'Happy' Morgan!\"    Happy Morgan, yelling like one possessed of ten shrill-tongued demons,  burst on the gallop away from the others, and spurring his horse  cruelly, forced the animal to race, bucking and plunging, half way  around the arena and back to the group. This, then, was a type of the  dare-devil horse breaker of the Wild West? The cheers travelled in waves  around and around the house and rocked back and forth like water pitched  from side to side in a monstrous bowl.    When the noise abated somewhat, \"And this, la-a-a-dies and gen'l'mun, is  the peerless, cowpuncher, 'Bud Reeves.'\"    Bud at once imitated the example of Happy Morgan, and one after another  the five remaining riders followed suit. In the meantime a number of  prancing, kicking, savage-eyed horses were brought into the arena and to  these the master of ceremonies now turned his attention.    \"From the wildest regions of the range we have brought mustangs that  never have borne the weight of man. They fight for pleasure; they buck  by instinct. If you doubt it, step down and try 'em. One hundred dollars  to the man who sticks on the back of one of 'em--but we won't pay the  hospital bill!\"    He lowered his megaphone to enjoy the laughter, and the small man took  this opportunity to say: \"Never borne the weight of a man! That chap in  the dress-suit, he tells one lie for pleasure and ten more from  instinct. Yep, he has his hosses beat. Never borne the weight of man!  Why, Drew, I can see the saddle-marks clear from here; I got a mind to  slip down there and pick up the easiest hundred bones that ever rolled  my way.\"    He rose to make good his threat, but Drew cut in with: \"Don't be a damn  fool, Werther. You aren't part of this show.\"    \"Well, I will be soon. Watch me! There goes Ananias on his second wind.\"    The announcer was bellowing: \"These man-killing mustangs will be ridden,  broken, beaten into submission in fair fight by the greatest set of  horse-breakers that ever wore spurs. They can ride anything that walks  on four feet and wears a skin; they can--\"    Werther sprang to his feet, made a funnel of his hand, and shouted:  \"Yi-i-i-ip!\"    If he had set off a great quantity of red fire he could not more  effectively have drawn all eyes upon him. The weird, shrill yell cut the  ringmaster short, and a pleased murmur ran through the crowd. Of course,  this must be part of the show, but it was a pleasing variation.    \"Partner,\" continued Werther, brushing away the big hand of Drew which  would have pulled him down into his seat; \"I've seen you bluff for two  nights hand running. There ain't no man can bluff all the world three  times straight.\"    The ringmaster retorted in his great voice: \"That sounds like good  poker. What's your game?\"    \"Five hundred dollars on one card!\" cried Werther, and he waved a  fluttering handful of greenbacks. \"Five hundred dollars to any man of  your lot--or to any man in this house that can ride a real wild horse.\"    \"Where's your horse?\"    \"Around the corner in a Twenty-sixth Street stable. I'll have him here  in five minutes.\"    \"Lead him on,\" cried the ringmaster, but his voice was not quite so  loud.    Werther muttered to Drew:    \"Here's where I hand him the lemon that'll curdle his cream,\" and ran  out of the box and straight around the edge of the arena. New York,  murmuring and chuckling through the vast galleries of the Garden,  applauded the little man's flying coat-tails.    He had not underestimated the time; in a little less than his five  minutes the doors at the end of the arena were thrown wide and Werther  reappeared. Behind him came two stalwarts leading between them a rangy  monster. Before the blast of lights and the murmurs of the throng the  big stallion reared and flung himself back, and the two who lead him  bore down with all their weight on the halter ropes. He literally walked  down the planks into the arena, a strange, half-comical, half-terrible  spectacle. New York burst into applause. It was a trained horse, of  course, but a horse capable of such training was worth applause.    At that roar of sound, vague as the beat of waves along the shore, the  stallion lurched down on all fours and leaped ahead, but the two on the  halter ropes drove all their weight backward and checked the first  plunge. A bright-coloured scarf waved from a nearby box, and the  monster swerved away. So, twisting, plunging, rearing, he was worked  down the arena. As he came opposite a box in which sat a tall young man  in evening clothes the latter rose and shouted: \"Bravo!\"    The fury of the stallion, searching on all sides for a vent but  distracted from one torment to another, centred suddenly on this slender  figure. He swerved and rushed for the barrier with ears flat back and  bloodshot eyes. There he reared and struck at the wood with his great  front hoofs; the boards splintered and shivered under the blows.    As for the youth in the box, he remained quietly erect before this brute  rage. A fleck of red foam fell on the white front of his shirt. He drew  his handkerchief and wiped it calmly away, but a red stain remained. At  the same time the two who led the stallion pulled him back from the  barrier and he stood with head high, searching for a more convenient  victim.    Deep silence spread over the arena; more hushed and more hushed it grew,  as if invisible blankets of soundlessness were dropping down over the  stirring masses; men glanced at each other with a vague surmise, knowing  that this was no part of the performance. The whole audience drew  forward to the edge of the seats and stared, first at the monstrous  horse, and next at the group of men who could \"ride anything that walks  on four feet and wears a skin.\"    Some of the women were already turning away their heads, for this was to  be a battle, not a game; but the vast majority of New York merely  watched and waited and smiled a slow, stiff-lipped smile. All the  surroundings were changed, the flaring electric lights, the vast roof,  the clothes of the multitude, but the throng of white faces"]]]
