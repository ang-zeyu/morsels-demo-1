HARRY M. DAUGHERTY    ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES    A TRUE AND LOYAL FRIEND, A FAIR AND CHIVALROUS FOE    With whom it is the author's great privilege to collaborate as  Solicitor-General in defending and vindicating in the Supreme Court of  the United States the principles and mandates of its Constitution    _Chamonix_,    _July_ 14 1922          _Preface by the Earl of Balfour_[1]      I have been greatly honoured by your invitation to take the chair on  this interesting occasion. It gives me special pleasure to be able to  introduce to this distinguished audience my friend, Mr. Beck,  Solicitor-General of the United States. It is a great and responsible  office; but long before he held it he was known to the English public  and to English readers as the author who, perhaps more than any other  writer in our language, contributed a statement of the Allied case in  the Great War which produced effects far beyond the country in which it  was written or the public to which it was first addressed. Mr. Beck  approached that great theme in the spirit of a great judge; he  marshalled his arguments with the skill of a great advocate, and the  combination of these qualities--qualities, highly appreciated  everywhere, but nowhere more than in this Hall and among a Gray's Inn  audience--has given an epoch-making character to his work. To-day he  comes before us in a different character. He is neither judge nor  advocate, but historian: and he offers to guide us through one of the  most interesting and important enterprises in which our common race has  ever been engaged.    The framers of the American Constitution were faced with an entirely new  problem, so far, at all events, as the English-speaking world was  concerned; and though they founded their doctrines upon the English  traditions of law and liberty, they had to deal with circumstances which  none of their British progenitors had to face, and they showed a  masterly spirit in adapting the ideas of which they were the heirs to a  new country and new conditions. The result is one of the greatest pieces  of constructive statesmanship ever accomplished. We, who belong to the  British Empire, are at this moment engaged, under very different  circumstances, in welding slowly and gradually the scattered fragments  of the British Empire into an organic whole, which must, from the very  nature of its geographical situation, have a Constitution as different  from that of the British Isles, as the Constitution of the British Isles  is different from that of the American States. But all three spring from  one root; all three are carried out by men of like political ideals; all  three are destined to promote the cause of ordered liberty throughout  the world. In the meanwhile we on this side of the Atlantic cannot do  better than study, under the most favourable and fortunate conditions,  the story of the great constitutional adventure which has given us the  United States of America.    A.J.B.    [Footnote 1: [Address of the Earl of Balfour as Chairman on the occasion  of the delivery on June 13, 1922, in Gray's Inn of the first of the  lectures herein reprinted.]]          _Introduction by Sir John Simon, K.C._[2]      I have the privilege and the honour of adding a few words to express our  thanks to the Solicitor-General of the United States for this memorable  course of lectures. They are memorable alike for their subject and their  form; alike for the place in which we are met and for the man who has so  generously given of his time and learning for our instruction. Mr. Beck  is always a welcome visitor to our shores, and nowhere is he more  welcome than in these ancient Inns of Court which are the home and  source of law for Americans and Englishmen alike. In contemplating the  edifice reared by the Fathers of the American Constitution we take pride  in remembering that it was built upon British foundations by men, many  of whom were trained in the English Courts; and when Mr. Beck lectures  on this subject to us, our interest and our sympathy are redoubled by  the thought that whatever differences there may be between the Old World  and the New, citizens of the United States and ourselves are the Sons of  a Common Mother and jointly inherit the treasure of the Common Law. And  we cannot part with Mr. Beck on this occasion without a personal word.  Plato records a saying of Socrates that the dog is a true philosopher  because philosophy is love of knowledge, and a dog, while growling at  strangers, always welcomes the friends that he knows. And the British  public often greets its visitors with a touch of this canine philosophy.  We regard Mr. Beck, not as a casual visitor, but as a firm friend to  whom we owe much; he has been here again and again and we hope will  often repeat his visits, and Englishmen will never forget how, at a  crisis in our fate, Mr. James Beck profoundly influenced the judgment of  the neutral world and vindicated, by his masterly and sympathetic  argument, the justice of our cause.    [Footnote 2: Address of Sir John Simon on the conclusion, on June  19,1922, of the three lectures herein printed.]          _Author's Introduction_      This book is a result of three lectures, which were delivered in the  Hall of Gray's Inn, London, on June 13, 15, and 19, 1922, respectively,  under the auspices and on the invitation of the University of London.  The invitation originated with the University of Manchester, which,  through its then Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Ramsay Muir, two years ago  graciously invited me to visit Manchester and explain American political  institutions to the undergraduates. Subsequently I was greatly honoured  when the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh and London joined in the  invitation.    Unfortunately for me--for I greatly valued the privilege of explaining  the institutions of my country to the undergraduates of these great  Universities--my political duties made it impossible for me to visit  England prior to June 1, about which time the Supreme Court of the  United States, in which my official duties largely preoccupy my time,  adjourns for the summer. Any dates after June 1 were inconvenient to the  first three Universities, but it was my good fortune that the University  of London was able to carry out the plan, and that it had the cordial  co-operation of that venerable Inn of Court, Gray's Inn, one of the  \"noblest nurseries of legal training.\"    Thus I was privileged to address at once an academic and a professional  audience.    I came to England for this purpose as a labour of love. I had no  anticipation of success, for I feared that the interest in the  subject-matter of my lectures would be very slight.    My surprise and gratification increased on the occasion of each lecture,  as the audiences grew in numbers and distinction. Many leading jurists  and statesmen took more than a mere complimentary interest, and some of  them, although pressed with social and public duties, honoured me with  their attendance at all three lectures. How can I adequately express my  appreciation of the great honour thus done me by the Earl of Balfour,  the Lord Chancellor, Lord Justice Atkin, the Vice-Chancellor of the  University of London, and many other leaders in academic and legal  circles--not to forget the Chief Justice of the United States, who paid  me the great compliment of attending the last lecture. To one and nil of  my auditors, my heartfelt thanks!    I also must not fail to acknowledge the generous space given in the  British Press to these lectures, and the even more generous allusions to  them in the editorial columns. An especial acknowledgment is due to  Viscount Burnham and _The Daily Telegraph_ for their generous interest  in this book. The good cause of Anglo-American friendship has no better  friend than Lord Burnham.    This experience has convinced me that now, more than ever before, there  is in England a deep interest in American institutions and their  history. This is as it should be, for--for better or worse--England and  America will play together a great part in the future history of the  world. In double harness they are destined to pull the heavy load of the  world's problems. Therefore these \"yoke-fellows in equity\" must know  each other better, and, what is more, _pull together_.    As I was revising the proofs of these lectures in beautiful Chamonix,  the prospectus of the Scottish-American Association reached me, in which  its Honorary Secretary and my good friend, Dr. Charles Sarolea, took  occasion to make the following suggestion to his British compatriots:        \"To remove those causes of estrangement, to avoid a fateful      catastrophe, in other words, to bring about a cordial understanding      _with_ America, the first condition must be an understanding _of_      America. Such an understanding, or even the atmosphere in which such      an understanding may grow, has still to be created. It is indeed      passing strange that in these days of cheap books and free      education, America should be almost a '_terra incognita_,' that we      should know next to nothing of American history, of the American      Constitution, of American practical politics, of the American      mentality.

Yet there is a way to talk above the noise of a  freight train just as there is a way to whistle into the teeth of a  stiff wind. This freight-car talk is pitched just above the ordinary  tone--it is an overtone of conversation, one might say--and it is  distinctly nasal. The brakie could talk above the racket, and so, of  course, could Lefty Joe. They sat about in the center of the train, on  the forward end of one of the cars. No matter how the train lurched and  staggered over that fearful road bed, these two swayed in their places  as easily and as safely as birds on swinging perches. The brakie had  touched Lefty Joe for two dollars; he had secured fifty cents; and since  the vigor of Lefty's oaths had convinced him that this was all the money  the tramp had, the two now sat elbow to elbow and killed the distance  with their talk.    \"It's like old times to have you here,\" said the brakie. \"You used to  play this line when you jumped from coast to coast.\"    \"Sure,\" said Lefty Joe, and he scowled at the mountains on either side  of the pass. The train was gathering speed, and the peaks lurched  eastward in a confused, ragged procession. \"And a durned hard ride it's  been many a time.\"    \"Kind of queer to see you,\" continued the brakie. \"Heard you was rising  in the world.\"    He caught the face of the other with a rapid side glance, but Lefty Joe  was sufficiently concealed by the dark.    \"Heard you were the main guy with a whole crowd behind you,\" went on the  brakie.    \"Yeh?\"    \"Sure. Heard you was riding the cushions, and all that.\"    \"Yeh?\"    \"But I guess it was all bunk; here you are back again, anyway.\"    \"Yep,\" agreed Lefty.    The brakie scratched his head, for the silence of the tramp convinced  him that there had been, after all, a good deal of truth in the rumor.  He ran back on another tack and slipped about Lefty.    \"I never laid much on what they said,\" he averred. \"I know you, Lefty;  you can do a lot, but when it comes to leading a whole gang, like they  said you was, and all that--well, I knew it was a lie. Used to tell 'em  that.\"    \"You talked foolish, then,\" burst out Lefty suddenly. \"It was all  straight.\"    The brakie could hear the click of his companion's teeth at the period  to this statement, as though he regretted his outburst.    \"Well, I'll be hanged,\" murmured the brakie innocently.    Ordinarily, Lefty was not easily lured, but this night he apparently was  in the mood for talk.    \"Kennebec Lou, the Clipper, and Suds. Them and a lot more. They was all  with me; they was all under me; I was the Main Guy!\"    What a ring in his voice as he said it! The beaten general speaks thus  of his past triumphs. The old man remembered his youth in such a voice.  The brakie was impressed; he repeated the three names.    \"Even Suds?\" he said. \"Was even Suds with you?\"    \"Even Suds!\"    The brakie stirred a little, wabbling from side to side as he found a  more comfortable position; instead of looking straight before him, he  kept a side-glance steadily upon his companion, and one could see that  he intended to remember what was said on this night.    \"Even Suds,\" echoed the brakie. \"Good heavens, and ain't he a man for  you?\"    \"He was a man,\" replied Lefty Joe with an indescribable emphasis.    \"Huh?\"    \"He ain't a man any more.\"    \"Get bumped off?\"    \"No. Busted.\"    The brakie considered this bit of news and rolled it back and forth and  tried its flavor against his gossiping palate.    \"Did you fix him after he left you?\"    \"No.\"    \"I see. You busted him while he was still with you. Then Kennebec Lou  and the Clipper get sore at the way you treat Suds. So here you are back  on the road with your gang all gone bust. Hard luck, Lefty.\"    But Lefty whined with rage at this careless diagnosis of his downfall.    \"You're all wrong,\" he said. \"You're all wrong. You don't know nothin'.\"    The brakie waited, grinning securely into the night, and preparing his  mind for the story. But the story consisted of one word, flung bitterly  into the rushing air.    \"Donnegan!\"    \"Him?\" cried the brakie, starting in his place.    \"Donnegan!\" cried Lefty, and his voice made the word into a curse.    The brakie nodded.    \"Them that get tangled with Donnegan don't last long. You ought to know  that.\"    At this the grief, hate, and rage in Lefty Joe were blended and caused  an explosion.    \"Confound Donnegan. Who's Donnegan? I ask you, who's Donnegan?\"    \"A guy that makes trouble,\" replied the brakie, evidently hard put to it  to find a definition.    \"Oh, don't he make it, though? Confound him!\"    \"You ought to of stayed shut of him, Lefty.\"    \"Did I hunt him up, I ask you? Am I a nut? No, I ain't. Do I go along  stepping on the tail of a rattlesnake? No more do I look up Donnegan.\"    He groaned as he remembered.    \"I was going fine. Nothing could of been better. I had the boys  together. We was doing so well that I was riding the cushions and I went  around planning the jobs. Nice, clean work. No cans tied to it. But one  day I had to meet Suds down in the Meriton Jungle. You know?\"    \"I've heard--plenty,\" said the brakie.    \"Oh, it ain't so bad--the Meriton. I've seen a lot worse. Found Suds  there, and Suds was playing Black Jack with an ol gink. He was trimmin'  him close. Get Suds going good and he could read 'em three down and bury  'em as fast as they came under the bottom card. Takes a hand to do that  sort of work. And that's the sort of work Suds was doing for the old  man. Pretty soon the game was over and the old man was busted. He took  up his pack and beat it, saying nothing and looking sick. I started  talking to Suds.    \"And while he was talking, along comes a bo and gives us a once-over. He  knew me. 'Is this here a friend of yours, Lefty? he says.    \"'Sure,' says I.    \"'Then, he's in Dutch. He trimmed that old dad, and the dad is one of  Donnegan's pals. Wait till Donnegan hears how your friend made the cards  talk while he was skinning the old boy!    \"He passes me the wink and goes on. Made me sick. I turned to Suds, and  the fool hadn't batted an eye. Never even heard of Donnegan. You know  how it is? Half the road never heard of it; part of the roads don't know  nothin' else. He's like a jumpin tornado; hits every ten miles and don't  bend a blade of grass in between.    \"Took me about five minutes to tell Suds about Donnegan. Then Suds let  out a grunt and started down the trail for the old dad. Missed him. Dad  had got out of the Jungle and copped a rattler. Suds come back half  green and half yeller.    \"'I've done it; I've spilled the beans,' he says.    \"'That ain't half sayin' it,' says I.    \"Well, we lit out after that and beat it down the line as fast as we  could. We got the rest of the boys together; I had a swell job planned  up. Everything staked. Then, the first news come that Donnegan was after  Suds.    \"News just dropped on us out of the sky. Suds, you know how he is.  Strong bluff. Didn't bat an eye. Laughed at this Donnegan. Got a hold of  an old pal of his, named Levine, and he is a mighty hot scrapper. From a  knife to a toenail, they was nothing that Levine couldn't use in a  fight. Suds sent him out to cross Donnegan's trail.    \"He crossed it, well enough. Suds got a telegram a couple days later  saying that Levine had run into a wild cat and was considerable chawed  and would Suds send him a stake to pay the doctor?    \"Well, after that Suds got sort of nervous. Didn't take no interest in  his work no more. Kept a weather eye out watching for the coming of  Donnegan. And pretty soon he up and cleaned out of camp.    \"Next day, sure enough, along comes Donnegan and asks for Suds. We kept  still--all but Kennebec Lou. Kennebec is some fighter himself. Two  hundred pounds of mule muscle with the brain of a devil to tell what to  do--yes, you can lay it ten to one that Kennebec is some fighter. That  day he had a good edge from a bottle of rye he was trying for a friend.    \"He didn't need to go far to find trouble in Donnegan. A wink and a grin  was all they needed for a password, and then they went at each other's  throats. Kennebec made the first pass and hit thin air; and before he  got back on his heels, Donnegan had hit him four times. Then Kennebec  jumped back and took a fresh start with a knife.\"    Here Lefty Joe paused and sighed.    He continued, after a long interval: \"Five minutes later we was all busy  tyin' up what was left of Kennebec; Donnegan was down the road whistlin'  like a bird. And that was the end of my gang. What with Kennebec Lou and  Suds both gone, what chance did I have to hold the boys together?\"          2      The brakie heard this recital with the keenest interest, nodding from  time to time.    \"What beats me, Lefty,\" he said at the end of the story, \"is why you  didn't knife into the fight yourself and take a hand with Donnegan\"    At this Lefty was silent. It was rather the silence of one which cannot  tell whether or not it is worth while to speak than it was the silence  of one who needs time for thought.    \"I'll tell you why, bo. It's because when I take a trail like that it  only has one end I'm going to bump off the other bird or he's going to  bump off me\"    The brakie cleared his throat    \"Look here,\" he said, \"looks to me like a queer thing that you're on  this train\"    \"Does it\" queried Lefty softly \"Why?\"    \"Because Donnegan is two cars back, asleep.\"    \"The devil you say!\"    The brakie broke into laughter    \"Don't kid yourself along,\" he warned. \"Don't do it. It ain't  wise--with me.\"    \"What you mean?\"    \"Come on, Lefty. Come clean. You better do a fade"]]]
