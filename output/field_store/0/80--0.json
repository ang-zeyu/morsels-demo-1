THE APPETITE OF TYRANNY     IV. THE ESCAPE OF FOLLY            INTRODUCTION.    THE FACTS OF THE CASE.    Unless we are all mad, there is at the back of the most bewildering  business a story: and if we are all mad, there is no such thing as  madness. If I set a house on fire, it is quite true that I may illuminate  many other people's weaknesses as well as my own. It may be that the master  of the house was burned because he was drunk: it may be that the mistress  of the house was burned because she was stingy, and perished arguing about  the expense of a fire-escape. It is, nevertheless, broadly true that they  both were burned because I set fire to their house. That is the story  of the thing. The mere facts of the story about the present European  conflagration are quite as easy to tell.    Before we go on to the deeper things which make this war the most sincere  war of human history, it is as easy to answer the question of why England  came to be in it at all, as it is to ask how a man fell down a coal-hole,  or failed to keep an appointment. Facts are not the whole truth. But  facts are facts, and in this case the facts are few and simple. Prussia,  France, and England had all promised not to invade Belgium. Prussia  proposed to invade Belgium, because it was the safest way of invading  France. But Prussia promised that if she might break in, through her own  broken promise and ours, she would break in and not steal. In other words,  we were offered at the same instant a promise of faith in the future and  a proposal of perjury in the present. Those interested in human origins  may refer to an old Victorian writer of English, who, in the last and most  restrained of his historical essays, wrote of Frederick the Great, the  founder of this unchanging Prussian policy. After describing how Frederick  broke the guarantee he had signed on behalf of Maria Theresa, he then  describes how Frederick sought to put things straight by a promise that  was an insult. \"If she would but let him have Silesia, he would, he said,  stand by her against any power which should try to deprive her of her other  dominions, as if he was not already bound to stand by her, or as if his new  promise could be of more value than the old one.\" That passage was written  by Macaulay, but so far as the mere contemporary facts are concerned it  might have been written by me.    Upon the immediate logical and legal origin of the English interest  there can be no rational debate. There are some things so simple that  one can almost prove them with plans and diagrams, as in Euclid. One  could make a kind of comic calendar of what would have happened to the  English diplomatist, if he had been silenced every time by Prussian  diplomacy. Suppose we arrange it in the form of a kind of diary:    July 24: Germany invades Belgium.    July 25: England declares war.    July 26: Germany promises not to annex Belgium.    July 27: England withdraws from the war.    July 28: Germany annexes Belgium, England declares war.    July 29: Germany promises not to annex France, England withdraws from the  war.    July 30: Germany annexes France, England declares war.    July 31: Germany promises not to annex England.    Aug. 1: England withdraws from the war. Germany invades England.    How long is anybody expected to go on with that sort of game; or keep peace  at that illimitable price? How long must we pursue a road in which promises  are all fetishes in front of us; and all fragments behind us? No; upon the  cold facts of the final negotiations, as told by any of the diplomatists in  any of the documents, there is no doubt about the story. And no doubt about  the villain of the story.    These are the last facts; the facts which involved England. It is equally  easy to state the first facts; the facts which involved Europe. The  prince who practically ruled Austria was shot by certain persons whom the  Austrian Government believed to be conspirators from Servia. The Austrian  Government piled up arms and armies, but said not a word either to Servia  their suspect, or Italy their ally. From the documents it would seem  that Austria kept everybody in the dark, except Prussia. It is probably  nearer the truth to say that Prussia kept everybody in the dark, including  Austria. But all that is what is called opinion, belief, conviction, or  common sense: and we are not dealing with it here. The objective fact is  that Austria told Servia to permit Servian officers to be suspended by the  authority of Austrian officers; and told Servia to submit to this within  forty-eight hours. In other words, the Sovereign of Servia was practically  told to take off not only the laurels of two great campaigns, but his own  lawful and national crown, and to do it in a time in which no respectable  citizen is expected to discharge an hotel bill. Servia asked for time for  arbitration--in short, for peace. But Russia had already begun to mobilise;  and Prussia, presuming that Servia might thus be rescued, declared war.    Between these two ends of fact, the ultimatum to Servia, the ultimatum  to Belgium, anyone so inclined can of course talk as if everything were  relative. If anyone asks why the Czar should rush to the support of  Servia, it is easy to ask why the Kaiser should rush to the support of  Austria. If anyone says that the French would attack the Germans, it  is sufficient to answer that the Germans did attack the French. There  remain, however, two attitudes to consider, even perhaps two arguments to  counter, which can best be considered and countered under this general  head of facts. First of all, there is a curious, cloudy sort of argument,  much affected by the professional rhetoricians of Prussia, who are sent  out to instruct and correct the minds of Americans or Scandinavians. It  consists of going into convulsions of incredulity and scorn at the mention  of Russia's responsibility of Servia, or England's responsibility of  Belgium; and suggesting that, treaty or no treaty, frontier or no frontier,  Russia would be out to slay Teutons or England to steal Colonies. Here, as  elsewhere, I think the professors dotted all over the Baltic plain fail in  lucidity and in the power of distinguishing ideas. Of course it is quite  true that England has material interests to defend, and will probably use  the opportunity to defend them; or, in other words, of course England, like  everybody else, would be more comfortable if Prussia were less predominant.    The fact remains that we did not do what the Germans did. We did not  invade Holland to seize a naval and commercial advantage; and whether  they say that we wished to do it in our greed, or feared to do it in our  cowardice, the fact remains that we did not do it. Unless this commonsense  principle be kept in view, I cannot conceive how any quarrel can possibly  be judged. A contract may be made between two persons solely for material  advantage on each side: but the moral advantage is still generally  supposed to lie with the person who keeps the contract. Surely it cannot  be dishonest to be honest--even if honesty is the best policy. Imagine the  most complex maze of indirect motive; and still the man who keeps faith for  money cannot possibly be worse than the man who breaks faith for money. It  will be noted that this ultimate test applies in the same way to Servia as  to Belgium and Britain. The Servians may not be a very peaceful people,  but on the occasion under discussion it was certainly they who wanted  peace. You may choose to think the Serb a sort of born robber: but on this  occasion it was certainly the Austrian who was trying to rob. Similarly,  you may call England perfidious as a sort of historical summary; and  declare your private belief that Mr. Asquith was vowed from infancy to the  ruin of the German Empire, a Hannibal and hater of the eagles. But, when  all is said, it is nonsense to call a man perfidious because he keeps his  promise. It is absurd to complain of the sudden treachery of a business man  in turning up punctually to his appointment: or the unfair shock given to a  creditor by the debtor paying his debts.    Lastly, there is an attitude, not unknown in the crisis, against which I  should particularly like to protest. I should address my protest especially  to those lovers and pursuers of peace who, very shortsightedly, have  occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which is impatient of these  preliminary details about who did this or that, and whether it was right  or wrong. They are satisfied with saying that an enormous calamity, called  war, has been begun by some or all of us and should be ended by some or  all of us. To these people, this preliminary chapter about the precise  happenings must appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest  part of the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell  these people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles  of human justice and historic continuity; but that they are specially and  supremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and international  peace.    These sincere and high-minded peace-lovers are always telling us that  citizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that  nations should no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are always  telling us that we no longer fight duels; and need not wage wars. In  short, they perpetually base their peace proposals on the fact that an  ordinary citizen no longer avenges himself with an axe. But how is he  prevented from revenging himself with an axe? If he hits his neighbour on  the head with the kitchen chopper, what do we do?

FRIENDS THOUGH DIVIDED      A TALE OF THE CIVIL WAR    BY    G.A. HENTY      AUTHOR OF \"IN TIMES OF PERIL,\" \"THE YOUNG FRANCTIREURS,\"  \"THE YOUNG BUGLERS,\" ETC, ETC.          PREFACE      My dear lads: Although so long a time has elapsed since the great civil  war in England, men are still almost as much divided as they were then  as to the merits of the quarrel, almost as warm partisans of the one  side or the other. Most of you will probably have formed an opinion as  to the rights of the case, either from your own reading, or from hearing  the views of your elders.    For my part, I have endeavored to hold the scales equally, to relate  historical facts with absolute accuracy, and to show how much of right  and how much of wrong there was upon either side. Upon the one hand, the  king by his instability, bad faith, and duplicity alienated his best  friends, and drove the Commons to far greater lengths than they had at  first dreamed of. Upon the other hand, the struggle, begun only to win  constitutional rights, ended--owing to the ambition, fanaticism, and  determination to override all rights and all opinions save their own, of  a numerically insignificant minority of the Commons, backed by the  strength of the army--in the establishment of the most complete  despotism England has ever seen.    It may no doubt be considered a failing on my part that one of my heroes  has a very undue preponderance of adventure over the other. This I  regret; but after the scale of victory turned, those on the winning side  had little to do or to suffer, and one's interest is certainly with the  hunted fugitive, or the slave in the Bermudas, rather than with the  prosperous and well-to-do citizen.

It was a pleasant afternoon in the month of July, 1642, when three young  people sat together on a shady bank at the edge of a wood some three  miles from Oxford. The country was undulating and picturesque, and a  little more than a mile in front of them rose the lofty spire of St.  Helen's, Abingdon. The party consisted of two lads, who were about  fifteen years of age, and a girl of ten. The lads, although of about the  same height and build, were singularly unlike. Herbert Rippinghall was  dark and grave, his dress somber in hue, but good in material and well  made. Harry Furness was a fair and merry-looking boy; good humor was the  distinguishing characteristic of his face; his somewhat bright and  fashionably cut clothes were carelessly put on, and it was clear that no  thought of his own appearance or good looks entered his mind. He wore  his hair in ringlets, and had on his head a broad hat of felt with a  white feather, while his companion wore a plain cap, and his hair was  cut closely to his head.    \"It is a bad business, Harry,\" the latter said, \"but, there is one  satisfaction that, come what may, nothing can disturb our friendship. We  have never had a quarrel since we first met at the old school down  there, six years ago. We have been dear friends always, and my only  regret has been that your laziness has prevented our being rivals, for  neither would have grudged the other victory.\"    \"No, indeed, Herbert. But there was never a chance of that. You have  always been Mr. Gregory's prize boy, and are now head of the school;  while I have always been in his bad books. But, as you say, Herbert, we  have been dear friends, and, come what will, we'll continue so. We  cannot agree on the state of the kingdom, and shall never do so. We have  both taken our views from our parents; and indeed it seems to me that  the question is far too difficult a one for boys like us to form any  opinion of it. When we see some of the best and wisest in the land  ranging themselves on either side, it is clear that even such a wise  noddle as yours--to say nothing of a feather brain like mine--cannot  form any opinion on a subject which perplexes our elders and betters.\"    \"That is true, Harry; but still--\"    \"No, no, Herbert, we will have no argument. You have the best of it  there, and I fall back upon authority. My father, the colonel, is for  the king; yours for the Parliament. He says that there are faults on  both sides, and indeed, for years he favored the Commons. The king's  acts were unconstitutional and tyrannical, and my father approved of the  bold stand which Sir George Elliot made against him. Now, however, all  this has been changed, he tells me, and the Commons seek to rule without  either king or peers. They have sought to impose conditions which would  render them the lords absolute of England, and reduce the king to a mere  puppet. They have, too, attacked the Church, would abolish bishops, and  interfere in all matters spiritual. Therefore, my father, while  acknowledging the faults which the king has committed, and grieving  over the acts which have driven the Parliament to taking up a hostile  attitude to him, yet holds it his duty to support him against the  violent men who have now assumed power, and who are aiming at the  subversion of the constitution and the loss of the country.\"    \"I fear, also,\" Herbert said, \"that the Commons have gone grievously  beyond their rights, although, did my father hear me say so, I should  fall under his gravest displeasure. But he holds that it is necessary  that there should be an ecclesiastical sweep, that the prelates should  have no more power in the land, that popery should be put down with an  iron hand, and that, since kings cannot be trusted to govern well, all  power should be placed in the hands of the people. My own thoughts do  incline toward his; but, as you say, when one sees men like my Lord  Falkland, who have hitherto stood among the foremost in the ranks of  those who demand that the king shall govern according to law, now siding  with him against them, one cannot but feel how grave are the  difficulties, and how much is to be said on either side. How is one to  choose? The king is overbearing, haughty, and untrue to his word. The  Parliament is stiff-necked and bent upon acquiring power beyond what is  fair and right. There are, indeed, grievous faults on both sides. But it  seems to me that should the king now have his way and conquer the  Commons, he and his descendants will henceforth govern as absolute  monarchs, and the liberty of the people will be endangered; while on the  other hand, should the Parliament gain the upper hand, they will place  on a firm basis the liberties of Englishmen, and any excesses which they  may commit will be controlled and modified by a future parliament, for  the people of England will no more suffer tyranny on the part of the  Commons than of the king; but while they cannot change the one, it is  in their power to elect whom they will, and to send up men who will  govern things moderately and wisely.\"    \"At any rate,\" Harry said, \"my father thinks that there is neither  moderation nor wisdom among the zealots at Westminster; and as I hear  that many nobles and country gentlemen throughout England are of the  same opinion, methinks that though at present the Parliament have the  best of it, and have seized Portsmouth, and the Tower, and all the  depots of arms, yet that in the end the king will prevail against them.\"    \"I trust,\" Herbert continued earnestly, \"that there will be no fighting.  England has known no civil wars since the days of the Roses, and when we  see how France and Germany are torn by internal dissensions, we should  be happy indeed that England has so long escaped such a scourge. It is  indeed sad to think that friends should be arrayed against each other in  a quarrel in which both sides are in the wrong.\"    \"I hope,\" Harry said, \"that if they needs must fight, it will soon be  over, whichever way fortune may turn.\"    \"I think not,\" Herbert answered. \"It is a war of religion as much as a  war for power. The king and the Commons may strive who shall govern the  realm; but the people who will take up arms will do it more for the  triumph of Protestantism than for that of Pym and Hampden.\"    \"How tiresome you both are,\" Lucy Rippinghall interrupted, pouting. \"You  brought me out to gather flowers, and you do nothing but talk of kings  and Parliament, as if I cared for them. I call it very rude. Herbert is  often forgetful, and thinks of his books more than of me; but you,  Master Harry, are always polite and gentle, and I marvel much that you  should be so changed to-day.\"    \"Forgive me,\" Harry said, smiling. \"We have been very remiss, Miss  Lucy; but we will have no more of high politics, and will, even if never  again,\" he said sadly, \"devote all our energies to getting such a basket  of flowers for you as may fill your rooms with beaupots. Now, if your  majesty is ready to begin, we are your most obedient servants.\"    And so, with a laugh, the little party rose to their feet, and started  in quest of wild flowers."]]]
