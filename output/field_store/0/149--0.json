If the reader is anxious to illustrate any political position with the  \"signs of the times,\" he has only to start from Waterloo-place, (thus  commencing with a glorious reminiscence,) through Regent-street and  Portland-place, and make the architectural tour of the Regent's Park.  Entering the park from the New Road by York Gate, one of the first  objects for his admiration will be _York Terrace_, a splendid range of  private residences, which has the appearance of an unique palace. This  striking effect is produced by all the entrances being in the rear, where  the vestibules are protected by large porches. All the doors and windows  in the principal front represented in the engraving are uniform, and  appear like a suite of princely apartments, somewhat in the style of a  little Versailles. This idea is assisted by the gardens having no  divisions.    The architecture of the building is Graeco-Italian. It consists of an  entrance or ground story, with semicircular headed windows and rusticated  piers. A continued pedestal above the arches of these windows runs  through the composition, divided between the columns into balustrades, in  front of the windows of the principal story, to which they form handsome  balconies. The elegant windows of this and the principal chamber story  are of the Ilissus Ionic, and are decorated with a colonnade, completed  with a well-proportioned entablature from the same beautiful order. Mr.  Elmes, in his critical observations on this terrace, thinks the attic  story \"too irregular to accompany so chaste a composition as the Ionic,  to which it forms a crown;\" he likewise objects to the cornice and  blocking-course, as being \"also too small in proportion for the majesty  of the lower order.\"    York Terrace is from the design of Mr. Nash, whose genius not  unfrequently strays into such errors as our architectural critic has  pointed out.           *       *       *       *       *      VALENTINE CUSTOMS.    _(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_      As some of the customs described by your correspondent W.H.H.[1] are left  unaccounted for, I suppose any one is at liberty to sport a few  conjectures on the subject. May not, for instance, the practice of  burning the \"_holly boy_\" have its origin in some of those rustic  incantations described by Theocritus as the means of recalling a truant  lover, or of warming a cold one; and thus translated:--        [1] See No. 356 of the MIRROR, \"Valentine's Day.\"      \"First Delphid injured me, he raised my flame,    And now I burn this bough in Delphid's name.\"    Virgil, too, in his 8th Eclogue, alludes to the same charm:--      \"Sparge molam, et fragiles incende bitumine lauros;    Daphnis me malus urit, ego hanc in Daphnide laurum.\"      \"Next in the fire the bays with brimstone burn,    And whilst it crackles in the sulphur, say,    This I for Daphnis burn, thus Daphnis burn away.\"                                     DRYDEN.    The _\"holly bush\"_ being made to represent the person beloved, may also  be borrowed from the ancients:--      -------------------\"Terque haec altaria circum    _Effigiem_ duco.\"                                        VIRGIL.      \"Thrice round the altar I the image draw.\"    The burning wax candles may be more difficult to account for, unless it  refer to the custom of melting wax in order to mollify the beloved one's  heart:--      \"As this devoted wax melts o'er the fire,    Let Myndian Delphis melt with soft desire.\"                                      THEOCRITUS.      ---------------\"Haec ut cera liquescit.\"    -------------\"Sic nostro Daphnis amore.\"                                     VIRGIL.    For a woman to compose a garland was always considered an indication of  her being in love. Aristophanes says,      \"The wreathing garlands in a woman is    The usual symptom of a love-sick mind.\"    Should the charms resorted to by lovers two thousand years ago, appear to  you, even remotely, to have influenced the love rites as performed by the  village men and maidens of the present day, perhaps you may deem this  string of quotations worthy of a corner in your amusing miscellany.

The figures that were first stamped on the coins of all  nations were those of oxen, horses, sheep, &c. It may, therefore, be  concluded, that the coins of any country which have only the figures of  cattle stamped on them, and perhaps of trees, representing the woods in  which their cattle pastured,--were the most ancient coins of the country.  Some of the gold coins found at Karnbre, and described by Dr. Borlase,  are of this kind, and may be justly esteemed the most ancient of our  British coins. Sovereigns soon became aware of the importance of money,  and took the fabrication of it under their own direction, ordering their  own heads to be impressed on one side of the coins, while the figure of  some animal still continued to be stamped on the other. Of this kind are  some of the Karnbre coins, with a royal head on one side, and a horse on  the other. When the knowledge and use of letters were once introduced  into any country, it would not be long before they appeared on its coins,  expressing the names of the princes whose heads were stamped on them.  This was a very great improvement in the art of coining, and gave an  additional value to the money, by preserving the memories of princes, and  giving light to history. Our British ancestors were acquainted with this  improvement before they were subdued by the Romans, as several coins of  ancient Britain have very plain and perfect inscriptions, and on that  account merit particular attention.    INA.           *       *       *       *       *      ANIMAL FOOD.    _(For the Mirror.)_      It is generally allowed, that a profusion of animal food has a tendency  to vitiate and debase the nature and dispositions of men;  notwithstanding, the lovers of flesh urge the names of many of the most  eminent in literature and science, in opposition to this assertion.    Plutarch attributed the stupidity of his countrymen, the Boeotians, to  the profusion of animal food which they consumed, and even now, our  lovely, soup drinking, coffee sipping friends on the continent, attribute  the saturnine, melancholy, and bearish dispositions of John Bull, to his  partiality for,      \"The famous roast-beef of Old England.\"    A facetious, philosophical, friend of mine, lately amused me with some  remarks, on the nature and properties of different kinds of food. \"We  know,\" said he, \"that one herb produces _this_ effect, and another  _that_; that different species and varieties of plants have different  virtues; and, why may we not infer that the same rule extends to animated  nature; that our fish, flesh, and fowl, not only serve as nutriment, but  that each kind possesses peculiar and individual properties.\"    This will account for the _piggish_ habits and propensities so  conspicuous in the inhabitants of certain places in England, and whose  partiality for _swine's flesh_, is proverbial. The _sheepish_ manners of  our students and school-boys, may also be attributed to the _mutton_ so  generally alloted to them. I might continue my observations, _ad  infinitum_. I might say, that the _wisdom of the goose_ was discoverable  in--whose love of that, \"most abused of God's creatures,\" is well known:  and that the sea-side predilections of a certain Bart., of festive  notoriety, were occasioned by his partiality for turtle.    QUAESITOR.           *       *       *       *       *      WHITEHALL.    MARRIAGE OF ANNE BOLEYN    _(For the Mirror)_      The extraordinary revolution which took place in our religious  institutions in the time of Henry VIII., has rendered his reign one of  the most important in the annals of ecclesiastical history. For the great  changes at that glorious aera, the reformation, when the clouds of  ignorance and superstition were dispelled, we are principally indebted to  the beauteous, but unfortunate Anne Boleyn, whose influence with the  haughty monarch, was the chief cause of the abolition of the papal  supremacy in England; one of the greatest blessings ever bestowed by a  monarch on his country. Intimately associated with, and the principal  scene of these important events, was the ancient palace of Whitehall,[3]  which Henry, into whose possession it came on the premunire of Wolsey,  considerably enlarged and beautified, changing its name from that of York  Place, to the one by which it is still designated.

The Result of Theosophical Study    Index          Chapter I    WHAT THEOSOPHY IS      \"There is a school of philosophy still in existence of which modern culture  has lost sight.\" In these words Mr. A.P. Sinnett began his book, _The  Occult World_, the first popular exposition of Theosophy, published thirty  years ago. [Namely in 1881.] During the years that have passed since then,  many thousands have learned wisdom in that school, yet to the majority its  teachings are still unknown, and they can give only the vaguest of replies  to the query, \"What is Theosophy?\"    Two books already exist which answer that question: Mr. Sinnett's _Esoteric  Buddhism_ and Dr. Besant's _The Ancient Wisdom_. I have no thought of  entering into competition with those standard works; what I desire is to  present a statement, as clear and simple as I can make it, which may be  regarded as introductory to them.    We often speak of Theosophy as not in itself a religion, but the truth  which lies behind all religions alike. That is so; yet, from another point  of view, we may surely say that it is at once a philosophy, a religion and  a science. It is a philosophy, because it puts plainly before us an  explanation of the scheme of evolution of both the souls and the bodies  contained in our solar system. It is a religion in so far as, having shown  us the course of ordinary evolution, it also puts before us and advises a  method of shortening that course, so that by conscious effort we may  progress more directly towards the goal. It is a science, because it treats  both these subjects as matters not of theological belief but of direct  knowledge obtainable by study and investigation. It asserts that man has no  need to trust to blind faith, because he has within him latent powers  which, when aroused, enable him to see and examine for himself, and it  proceeds to prove its case by showing how those powers may be awakened. It  is itself a result of the awakening of such powers by men, for the  teachings which it puts before us are founded upon direct observations made  in the past, and rendered possible only by such development.    As a philosophy, it explains to us that the solar system is a  carefully-ordered mechanism, a manifestation of a magnificent life, of  which man is but a small part. Nevertheless, it takes up that small part  which immediately concerns us, and treats it exhaustively under three  heads--present, past and future.    It deals with the present by describing what man really is, as seen by  means of developed faculties. It is customary to speak of man as having a  soul. Theosophy, as the result of direct investigation, reverses that  dictum, and states that man _is_ a soul, and _has_ a body--in fact several  bodies, which are his vehicles and instruments in various worlds. These  worlds are not separate in space; they are simultaneously present with us,  here and now, and can be examined; they are the divisions of the material  side of Nature--different degrees of density in the aggregation of matter,  as will presently be explained in detail. Man has an existence in several  of these, but is normally conscious only of the lowest, though sometimes in  dreams and trances he has glimpses of some of the others. What is called  death is the laying aside of the vehicle belonging to this lowest world,  but the soul or real man in a higher world is no more changed or affected  by this than the physical man is changed or affected when he removes his  overcoat. All this is a matter, not of speculation, but of observation and  experiment.    Theosophy has much to tell us of the past history of man--of how in the  course of evolution he has come to be what he now is. This also is a matter  of observation, because of the fact that there exists an indelible record  of all that has taken place--a sort of memory of Nature--by examining which  the scenes of earlier evolution may be made to pass before the eyes of the  investigator as though they were happening at this moment. By thus studying  the past we learn that man is divine in origin and that he has a long  evolution behind him--a double evolution, that of the life or soul within,  and that of the outer form. We learn, too, that the life of man as a soul  is of, what to us seems, enormous length, and that what we have been in the  habit of calling his life is in reality only one day of his real existence.  He has already lived through many such days, and has many more of them yet  before him; and if we wish to understand the real life and its object, we  must consider it in relation not only to this one day of it, which begins  with birth and ends with death, but also to the days which have gone before  and those which are yet to come.    Of those that are yet to come there is also much to be said, and on this  subject, too, a great deal of definite information is available. Such  information is obtainable, first, from men who have already passed much  further along the road of evolution than we, and have consequently direct  experience of it; and, secondly, from inferences drawn from the obvious  direction of the steps which we see to have been previously taken. The goal  of this particular cycle is in sight, though still far above us but it  would seem that, even when that has been attained, an infinity of progress  still lies before everyone who is willing to undertake it.    One of the most striking advantages of Theosophy is that the light which it  brings to us at once solves many of our problems, clears away many  difficulties, accounts for the apparent injustices of life, and in all  directions brings order out of seeming chaos. Thus, while some of its  teaching is based upon the observation of forces whose direct working is  somewhat beyond the ken of the ordinary man of the world, if the latter  will accept it as a hypothesis he will very soon come to see that it must  be a correct one, because it, and it alone, furnishes a coherent and  reasonable explanation of the drama of life which is being played before  him.    The existence of Perfected Men, and the possibility of coming into touch  with Them and being taught by Them, are prominent among the great new  truths which Theosophy brings to the western world. Another of them is the  stupendous fact that the world is not drifting blindly into anarchy, but  that its progress is under the control of a perfectly organized Hierarchy,  so that final failure even for the tiniest of its units is of all  impossibilities the most impossible. A glimpse of the working of that  Hierarchy inevitably engenders the desire to co-operate with it, to serve  under it, in however humble a capacity, and some time in the far-distant  future to be worthy to join the outer fringes of its ranks.    This brings us to that aspect of Theosophy which we have called religious.  Those who come to know and to understand these things are dissatisfied with  the slow aeons of evolution; they yearn to become more immediately useful,  and so they demand and obtain knowledge of the shorter but steeper Path.  There is no possibility of escaping the amount of work that has to be done.  It is like carrying a load up a mountain; whether one carries it straight  up a steep path or more gradually by a road of gentle slope, precisely the  same number of foot-pounds must be exerted. Therefore to do the same work  in a small fraction of the time means determined effort. It can be done,  however, for it has been done; and those who have done it agree that it far  more than repays the trouble. The limitations of the various vehicles are  thereby gradually transcended, and the liberated man becomes an intelligent  co-worker in the mighty plan for the evolution of all beings.    In its capacity as a religion, too, Theosophy gives its followers a rule of  life, based not on alleged commands delivered at some remote period of the  past, but on plain common sense as indicated by observed facts. The  attitude of the student of Theosophy towards the rules which it prescribes  resembles rather that which we adopt to hygienic regulations than obedience  to religious commandments. We may say, if we wish, that this thing or that  is in accordance with the divine Will, for the divine Will is expressed in  what we know as the laws of Nature. Because that Will wisely ordereth all  things, to infringe its laws means to disturb the smooth working of the  scheme, to hold back for a moment that fragment or tiny part of evolution,  and consequently to bring discomfort upon ourselves and others. It is for  that reason that the wise man avoids infringing them--not to escape the  imaginary wrath of some offended deity.    But if from a certain point of view we may think of Theosophy as a  religion, we must note two great points of difference between it and what  is ordinarily called religion in the West. First, it neither demands belief  from its followers, nor does it even speak of belief in the sense in which  that word is usually employed. The student of occult science either _knows_  a thing or suspends his judgment about it; there is no place in his scheme  for blind faith. Naturally, beginners in the study cannot yet _know_ for  themselves, so they are asked to read the results of the various  observations and to deal with them as probable hypotheses--provisionally to  accept and act upon them, until such time as they can prove them for  themselves.    Secondly, Theosophy never endeavours to convert any man from whatever  religion he already holds. On the"]]]
