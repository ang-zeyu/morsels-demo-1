If  anything could have driven me from Gladys, it would have been the  thought of such a father-in-law.  I am convinced that he really  believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a  week for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his  views upon bimetallism, a subject upon which he was by way of being an  authority.    For an hour or more that evening I listened to his monotonous chirrup  about bad money driving out good, the token value of silver, the  depreciation of the rupee, and the true standards of exchange.    \"Suppose,\" he cried with feeble violence, \"that all the debts in the  world were called up simultaneously, and immediate payment insisted  upon,--what under our present conditions would happen then?\"    I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man, upon  which he jumped from his chair, reproved me for my habitual levity,  which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in  my presence, and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic  meeting.    At last I was alone with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come!  All  that evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which  will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse  alternating in his mind.    She sat with that proud, delicate profile of hers outlined against the  red curtain.  How beautiful she was!  And yet how aloof!  We had been  friends, quite good friends; but never could I get beyond the same  comradeship which I might have established with one of my  fellow-reporters upon the Gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly,  and perfectly unsexual.  My instincts are all against a woman being too  frank and at her ease with me.  It is no compliment to a man.  Where  the real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are its companions,  heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in  hand.  The bent head, the averted eye, the faltering voice, the wincing  figure--these, and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply, are the  true signals of passion.  Even in my short life I had learned as much  as that--or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct.    Gladys was full of every womanly quality.  Some judged her to be cold  and hard; but such a thought was treason.  That delicately bronzed  skin, almost oriental in its coloring, that raven hair, the large  liquid eyes, the full but exquisite lips,--all the stigmata of passion  were there.  But I was sadly conscious that up to now I had never found  the secret of drawing it forth.  However, come what might, I should  have done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night.  She  could but refuse me, and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted  brother.    So far my thoughts had carried me, and I was about to break the long  and uneasy silence, when two critical, dark eyes looked round at me,  and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof.  \"I have a  presentiment that you are going to propose, Ned.  I do wish you  wouldn't; for things are so much nicer as they are.\"    I drew my chair a little nearer.  \"Now, how did you know that I was  going to propose?\" I asked in genuine wonder.    \"Don't women always know?  Do you suppose any woman in the world was  ever taken unawares?  But--oh, Ned, our friendship has been so good and  so pleasant!  What a pity to spoil it!  Don't you feel how splendid it  is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to  face as we have talked?\"    \"I don't know, Gladys.  You see, I can talk face to face with--with the  station-master.\"  I can't imagine how that official came into the  matter; but in he trotted, and set us both laughing.  \"That does not  satisfy me in the least.  I want my arms round you, and your head on my  breast, and--oh, Gladys, I want----\"    She had sprung from her chair, as she saw signs that I proposed to  demonstrate some of my wants.  \"You've spoiled everything, Ned,\" she  said.  \"It's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing  comes in!  It is such a pity!  Why can't you control yourself?\"    \"I didn't invent it,\" I pleaded.  \"It's nature.  It's love.\"    \"Well, perhaps if both love, it may be different.  I have never felt  it.\"    \"But you must--you, with your beauty, with your soul!  Oh, Gladys, you  were made for love!  You must love!\"    \"One must wait till it comes.\"    \"But why can't you love me, Gladys?  Is it my appearance, or what?\"    She did unbend a little.  She put forward a hand--such a gracious,  stooping attitude it was--and she pressed back my head.  Then she  looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile.    \"No it isn't that,\" she said at last.  \"You're not a conceited boy by  nature, and so I can safely tell you it is not that.  It's deeper.\"    \"My character?\"    She nodded severely.    \"What can I do to mend it?  Do sit down and talk it over.  No, really,  I won't if you'll only sit down!\"    She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my  mind than her whole-hearted confidence.  How primitive and bestial it  looks when you put it down in black and white!--and perhaps after all  it is only a feeling peculiar to myself.  Anyhow, she sat down.    \"Now tell me what's amiss with me?\"    \"I'm in love with somebody else,\" said she.    It was my turn to jump out of my chair.    \"It's nobody in particular,\" she explained, laughing at the expression  of my face: \"only an ideal.  I've never met the kind of man I mean.\"    \"Tell me about him.  What does he look like?\"    \"Oh, he might look very much like you.\"    \"How dear of you to say that!  Well, what is it that he does that I  don't do?  Just say the word,--teetotal, vegetarian, aeronaut,  theosophist, superman.  I'll have a try at it, Gladys, if you will only  give me an idea what would please you.\"    She laughed at the elasticity of my character.  \"Well, in the first  place, I don't think my ideal would speak like that,\" said she.  \"He  would be a harder, sterner man, not so ready to adapt himself to a  silly girl's whim.  But, above all, he must be a man who could do, who  could act, who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him, a  man of great deeds and strange experiences.  It is never a man that I  should love, but always the glories he had won; for they would be  reflected upon me.  Think of Richard Burton!  When I read his wife's  life of him I could so understand her love!  And Lady Stanley!  Did you  ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband?  These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul,  and yet be the greater, not the less, on account of her love, honored  by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds.\"    She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down  the whole level of the interview.  I gripped myself hard, and went on  with the argument.    \"We can't all be Stanleys and Burtons,\" said I; \"besides, we don't get  the chance,--at least, I never had the chance.  If I did, I should try  to take it.\"    \"But chances are all around you.  It is the mark of the kind of man I  mean that he makes his own chances.  You can't hold him back.  I've  never met him, and yet I seem to know him so well.  There are heroisms  all round us waiting to be done.  It's for men to do them, and for  women to reserve their love as a reward for such men.  Look at that  young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon.  It was blowing a  gale of wind; but because he was announced to go he insisted on  starting.  The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twenty-four  hours, and he fell in the middle of Russia.  That was the kind of man I  mean.  Think of the woman he loved, and how other women must have  envied her!  That's what I should like to be,--envied for my man.\"    \"I'd have done it to please you.\"    \"But you shouldn't do it merely to please me.  You should do it because  you can't help "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#1)"],[1,"JIMMYJOHN BOSS AND OTHER STORIES    By Owen Wister          To Messrs. Harper & Bothers and Henry Mills Alden whose friendliness and  fair dealing I am glad of this chance to record    Owen Wister          Preface         It's very plain that if a thing's the fashion--         Too much the fashion--if the people leap       To do it, or to be it, in a passion         Of haste and crowding, like a herd of sheep,         Why then that thing becomes through imitation         Vulgar, excessive, obvious, and cheap.         No gentleman desires to be pursuing         What every Tom and Dick and Harry's doing.         Stranger, do you write books? I ask the question,         Because I'm told that everybody writes       That what with scribbling, eating, and digestion,         And proper slumber, all our days and nights         Are wholly filled. It seems an odd suggestion--         But if you do write, stop it, leave the masses,         Read me, and join the small selected classes.          The Jimmyjohn Boss      I    One day at Nampa, which is in Idaho, a ruddy old massive jovial man  stood by the Silver City stage, patting his beard with his left hand,  and with his right the shoulder of a boy who stood beside him. He had  come with the boy on the branch train from Boise, because he was a  careful German and liked to say everything twice--twice at least when it  was a matter of business. This was a matter of very particular business,  and the German had repeated himself for nineteen miles. Presently the  east-bound on the main line would arrive from Portland; then the Silver  City stage would take the boy south on his new mission, and the man  would journey by the branch train back to Boise. From Boise no one could  say where he might not go, west or east. He was a great and pervasive  cattle man in Oregon, California, and other places. Vogel and Lex--even  to-day you may hear the two ranch partners spoken of. So the veteran  Vogel was now once more going over his notions and commands to his  youthful deputy during the last precious minutes until the east-bound  should arrive.    \"Und if only you haf someding like dis,\" said the old man, as he tapped  his beard and patted the boy, \"it would be five hoondert more dollars  salary in your liddle pants.\"    The boy winked up at his employer. He had a gray, humorous eye; he was  slim and alert, like a sparrow-hawk--the sort of boy his father openly  rejoices in and his mother is secretly in prayer over. Only, this boy  had neither father nor mother. Since the age of twelve he had looked out  for himself, never quite without bread, sometimes attaining champagne,  getting along in his American way variously, on horse or afoot, across  regions of wide plains and mountains, through towns where not a soul  knew his name. He closed one of his gray eyes at his employer, and  beyond this made no remark.    \"Vat you mean by dat vink, anyhow?\" demanded the elder.    \"Say,\" said the boy, confidentially--\"honest now. How about you and me?  Five hundred dollars if I had your beard. You've got a record and I've  got a future. And my bloom's on me rich, without a scratch. How many  dollars you gif me for dat bloom?\" The sparrow-hawk sailed into a  freakish imitation of his master.    \"You are a liddle rascal!\" cried the master, shaking with entertainment.  \"Und if der peoples vas to hear you sass old Max Vogel in dis style they  would say, 'Poor old Max, he lose his gr-rip.' But I don't lose it.\" His  great hand closed suddenly on the boy's shoulder, his voice cut clean  and heavy as an axe, and then no more joking about him. \"Haf you  understand that?\" he said.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"How old are you, son?\"    \"Nineteen, sir.\"    \"Oh my, that is offle young for the job I gif you. Some of dose man you  go to boss might be your father. Und how much do you weigh?\"    \"About a hundred and thirty.\"    \"Too light, too light. Und I haf keep my eye on you in Boise. You are  not so goot a boy as you might be.\"    \"Well, sir, I guess not.\"    \"But you was not so bad a boy as you might be, neider. You don't lie  about it. Now it must be farewell to all that foolishness. Haf you  understand? You go to set an example where one is needed very bad. If  those men see you drink a liddle, they drink a big lot. You forbid them,  they laugh at you. You must not allow one drop of whiskey at the whole  place. Haf you well understand?\"    \"Yes, sir. Me and whiskey are not necessary to each other's happiness.\"    \"It is not you, it is them. How are you mit your gun?\"    Vogel took the boy's pistol from its holster and aimed at an empty  bottle which was sticking in the thin Deceiver snow. \"Can you do this?\"  he said, carelessly, and fired. The snow struck the bottle, but the  unharming bullet was buried half an inch to the left.    The boy took his pistol with solemnity. \"No,\" he said. \"Guess I can't do  that.\" He fired, and the glass splintered into shapelessness. \"Told you  I couldn't miss as close as you did,\" said he.    \"You are a darling,\" said Mr. Vogel. \"Gif me dat lofely weapon.\"    A fortunate store of bottles lay, leaned, or stood about in the white  snow of Nampa, and Mr. Vogel began at them.    \"May I ask if anything is the matter?\" inquired a mild voice from the  stage.    \"Stick that lily head in-doors,\" shouted Vogel; and the face and  eye-glasses withdrew again into the stage. \"The school-teacher he will  be beautifool virtuous company for you at Malheur Agency,\" continued  Vogel, shooting again; and presently the large old German destroyed a  bottle with a crashing smack. \"Ah!\" said he, in unison with the smack.  \"Ah-ha! No von shall say der old Max lose his gr-rip. I shoot it efry  time now, but the train she whistle. I hear her.\"    The boy affected to listen earnestly.    \"Bah! I tell you I hear de whistle coming.\"    \"Did you say there was a whistle?\" ventured the occupant of the stage.  The snow shone white on his glasses as he peered out.    \"Nobody whistle for you,\" returned the robust Vogel. \"You listen to me,\"  he continued to the boy. \"You are offle yoong. But I watch you plenty  this long time. I see you work mit my stock on the Owyhee and the  Malheur; I see you mit my oder men. My men they say always more and  more, 'Yoong Drake he is a goot one,' und I think you are a goot one  mine own self. I am the biggest cattle man on the Pacific slope, und I  am also an old devil. I have think a lot, und I like you.\"    \"I'm obliged to you, sir.\"    \"Shut oop. I like you, und therefore I make you my new sooperintendent  at my Malheur Agency r-ranch, mit a bigger salary as you don't get  before. If you are a sookcess, I r-raise you some more.\"    \"I am satisfied now, sir.\"    \"Bah! Never do you tell any goot business man you are satisfied mit vat  he gif you, for eider he don't believe you or else he think you are a  fool. Und eider ways you go down in his estimation. You make those men  at Malheur Agency behave themselves und I r-raise you. Only I do vish, I  do certainly vish you had some beard on that yoong chin.\"    The boy glanced at his pistol.    \"No, no, no, my son,\" said the sharp old German. \"I don't want gunpowder  in dis affair. You must act kviet und decisif und keep your liddle shirt  on. What you accomplish shootin'? You kill somebody, und then, pop!  somebody kills you. What goot is all that nonsense to me?\"    \"It would annoy me some, too,\" retorted the boy, eyeing the capitalist.  \"Don't leave me out of the proposition.\"    \"Broposition! Broposition! Now you get hot mit old Max for nothing.\"    \"If you didn't contemplate trouble,\" pursued the boy, \"what was your  point just now in sampling my marksmanship?\" He kicked some snow in the  direction of the shattered bottle. \"It's understood no whiskey comes on  that ranch. But if no gunpowder goes along with me, either, let's call  the deal off. Buy some other fool.\"    \"You haf not understand, my boy. Und you get very hot because I happen  to make that liddle joke about somebody killing you. Was you thinking  maybe old Max not care what happen to you?\"    A moment of silence passed before the answer came: \"Suppose we talk  business?\"    \"Very well, very well. Only notice this thing. When oder peoples talk  oop to me like you haf done many times, it is not they who does the  getting hot. It is me--old Max. Und when old Max gets hot he slings them  out of his road anywheres. Some haf been very sorry they get so slung.  You invite me to buy some oder fool? Oh, my boy, I will buy no oder fool  except you, for that was just like me when I was yoong Max!\" Again the  ruddy and grizzled magnate put his hand on the shoulder of the boy, who  stood looking away at the bottles, at the railroad track, at anything  save his employer.    The employer proceeded: \"I was afraid of nobody und noding in those  days. You are afraid of nobody and noding. But those days was different.  No Pullman sleepers, no railroad at all. We come oop the Columbia in  the steamboat, we travel hoonderts of miles by team, we sleep, we eat  nowheres in particular mit many unexpected interooptions. There was  Indians, there was offle bad white men, und if you was not offle  yourself you vanished quickly. Therefore in those days was Max Vogel  hell und repeat.\"    The magnate smiled a broad fond smile over the past which he had kicked,  driven, shot, bled, and battled through to present power; and the boy  winked up at him again now.    \"I don't propose to vanish, myself,\" said he.    \"Ah-ha! you was no longer mad mit der old Max! Of coorse I care what  happens to you. I was alone in the world myself in those lofely wicked  days.\"    Reserve again made flinty the boy's face.    \"Neider did I talk about my feelings,\" continued Max Vogel, \"but I nefer  show them too quick. If I was injured I wait, and I strike to kill. We  all paddles our own dugout, eh? We ask no favors from nobody; we must  win our spurs! Not so? Now I talk business with you where you interroopt"]]]
