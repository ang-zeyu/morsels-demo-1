Includes bibliographical  references (p.).      Preface    Frederick Douglass lived so long, and played so conspicuous a part on  the world's stage, that it would be impossible, in a work of the  size of this, to do more than touch upon the salient features of his  career, to suggest the respects in which he influenced the course of  events in his lifetime, and to epitomize for the readers of another  generation the judgment of his contemporaries as to his genius and his  character.    Douglass's fame as an orator has long been secure. His position as the  champion of an oppressed race, and at the same time an example of its  possibilities, was, in his own generation, as picturesque as it  was unique; and his life may serve for all time as an incentive  to aspiring souls who would fight the battles and win the love of  mankind. The average American of to-day who sees, when his attention  is called to it, and deplores, if he be a thoughtful and just man,  the deep undertow of race prejudice that retards the progress of the  colored people of our own generation, cannot, except by reading the  painful records of the past, conceive of the mental and spiritual  darkness to which slavery, as the inexorable condition of its  existence, condemned its victims and, in a less measure, their  oppressors, or of the blank wall of proscription and scorn by which  free people of color were shut up in a moral and social Ghetto, the  gates of which have yet not been entirely torn down.    From this night of slavery Douglass emerged, passed through the limbo  of prejudice which he encountered as a freeman, and took his place in  history. \"As few of the world's great men have ever had so checkered  and diversified a career,\" says Henry Wilson, \"so it may at least be  plausibly claimed that no man represents in himself more conflicting  ideas and interests. His life is, in itself, an epic which finds few  to equal it in the realms of either romance or reality.\" It was, after  all, no misfortune for humanity that Frederick Douglass felt the iron  hand of slavery; for his genius changed the drawbacks of color and  condition into levers by which he raised himself and his people.    The materials for this work have been near at hand, though there is  a vast amount of which lack of space must prevent the use.  Acknowledgment is here made to members of the Douglass family for aid  in securing the photograph from which the frontispiece is reproduced.    The more the writer has studied the records of Douglass's life, the  more it has appealed to his imagination and his heart. He can claim no  special qualification for this task, unless perhaps it be a profound  and in some degree a personal sympathy with every step of Douglass's  upward career. Belonging to a later generation, he was only  privileged to see the man and hear the orator after his life-work was  substantially completed, but often enough then to appreciate  something of the strength and eloquence by which he impressed his  contemporaries. If by this brief sketch the writer can revive among  the readers of another generation a tithe of the interest that  Douglass created for himself when he led the forlorn hope of his race  for freedom and opportunity, his labor will be amply repaid.

I.      If it be no small task for a man of the most favored antecedents and  the most fortunate surroundings to rise above mediocrity in a great  nation, it is surely a more remarkable achievement for a man of the  very humblest origin possible to humanity in any country in any age of  the world, in the face of obstacles seemingly insurmountable, to win  high honors and rewards, to retain for more than a generation the  respect of good men in many lands, and to be deemed worthy of  enrolment among his country's great men. Such a man was Frederick  Douglass, and the example of one who thus rose to eminence by sheer  force of character and talents that neither slavery nor caste  proscription could crush must ever remain as a shining illustration  of the essential"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#1)"],[1,"By J.

FOREWORD      I. PRE-CHRISTIAN PANTHEISM     II. POST-CHRISTIAN PANTHEISM    III. MODERN PANTHEISM         AFTERWORD          PANTHEISM      FOREWORD.    [Sidenote: Pantheism not Sectarian or even Racial.]    Pantheism differs from the systems of belief constituting the main  religions of the world in being comparatively free from any limits of  period, climate, or race. For while what we roughly call the Egyptian  Religion, the Vedic Religion, the Greek Religion, Buddhism, and others  of similar fame have been necessarily local and temporary, Pantheism has  been, for the most part, a dimly discerned background, an esoteric  significance of many or all religions, rather than a \"denomination\" by  itself. The best illustration of this characteristic of Pantheism is the  catholicity of its great prophet Spinoza. For he felt so little  antagonism to any Christian sect, that he never urged any member of a  church to leave it, but rather encouraged his humbler friends, who  sought his advice, to make full use of such spiritual privileges as  they appreciated most. He could not, indeed, content himself with the  fragmentary forms of any sectarian creed. But in the few writings which  he made some effort to adapt to the popular understanding, he seems to  think it possible that the faith of Pantheism might some day leaven all  religions alike. I shall endeavour briefly to sketch the story of that  faith, and to suggest its significance for the future. But first we must  know what it means.    [Sidenote: Meaning of Pantheism.]    [Sidenote: God is All.]    [Sidenote: But not Everything Is God.]    [Sidenote: Analogy of the Human Organism.]    Pantheism, then, being a term derived from two Greek words signifying  \"all\" and \"God,\" suggests to a certain extent its own meaning. Thus, if  Atheism be taken to mean a denial of the being of God, Pantheism is its  extreme opposite; because Pantheism declares that there is nothing but  God. This, however, needs explanation. For no Pantheist has ever held  that _everything_ is God, any more than a teacher of physiology, in  enforcing on his students the unity of the human organism, would insist  that every toe and finger is the man. But such a teacher, at least in  these days, would almost certainly warn his pupils against the notion  that the man can be really divided into limbs, or organs, or faculties,  or even into soul and body. Indeed, he might without affectation adopt  the language of a much controverted creed, so far as to pronounce that  \"the reasonable soul and flesh is one man\"--\"one altogether.\" In this  view, the man is the unity of all organs and faculties. But it does not  in the least follow that any of these organs or faculties, or even a  selection of them, is the man.    [Sidenote: The Analogy Imperfect but Useful.]    If I apply this analogy to an explanation of the above definition of  Pantheism as the theory that there is nothing but God, it must not be  supposed that I regard the parallelism as perfect. In fact, one purpose  of the following exposition will be to show why and where all such  analogies fail. For Pantheism does not regard man, or any organism, as a  true unity. In the view of Pantheism the only real unity is God. But  without any inconsistency I may avail myself of common impressions to  correct a common mis-impression. Thus, those who hold that the  reasonable soul and flesh is one man--one altogether--but at the same  time deny that the toe or the finger, or the stomach or the heart, is  the man, are bound in consistency to recognise that if Pantheism affirms  God to be All in All, it does not follow that Pantheism must hold a man,  or a tree, or a tiger to be God.    [Sidenote: Farther Definition.]    Excluding, then, such an apparently plausible, but really fallacious  inversion of the Pantheistic view of the Universe, I repeat that the  latter is the precise opposite of Atheism. So far from tolerating any  doubt as to the being of God, it denies that there is anything else. For  all objects of sense and thought, including individual consciousness,  whether directly observed in ourselves, or inferred as existing in  others, are, according to Pantheism, only facets of an infinite Unity,  which is \"altogether one\" in a sense inapplicable to anything else.  Because that Unity is not merely the aggregate of all the finite objects  which we observe or infer, but is a living whole, expressing itself in  infinite variety. Of that infinite variety our gleams of consciousness  are infinitesimal parts, but not parts in a sense involving any real  division. The questions raised by such a view of the Universe, many of  them unanswerable--as is also the case with questions raised by every  other view of the Universe--will be considered further on. All that I  am trying to secure in these preliminary observations is a general idea  of the Pantheistic view of the Universe as distinguished from that of  Polytheism, Monotheism, or Atheism.    [Sidenote: Various Forms of Pantheism.]    [Sidenote: Spurious Forms.]    [Sidenote: Exclusion of Creation.]    [Sidenote: Evolution and Decay applicable only to Parts, not to the  Whole.]    Of course, there have been different forms of Pantheism, as there have  been also various phases of Monotheism; and in the brief historical  review which will follow this introductory explanation of the name, I  shall note at least the most important of those forms. But any which  fail to conform, to the general definition here given, will not be  recognised as Pantheism at all, though they may be worth some attention  as approximations thereto. For any view of the Universe, allowing the  existence of anything outside the divine Unity, denies that God is All  in All, and, therefore, is obviously not Pantheism. Whether we should  recognise as true Pantheism any theory involving the evolution of a  finite world or worlds out of the divine substance at some definite  epoch or epochs, may be a debatable question, provided that the eternity  and inviolability of the divine oneness is absolutely guarded in  thought. Yet I will anticipate so far as to say that, in my view, the  question must be negatived. At any rate, we must exclude all creeds  which tolerate the idea of a creation in the popular sense of the word,  or of a final catastrophe. True, the individual objects, great or small,  from a galaxy to a moth, which have to us apparently a separate  existence, have all been evolved out of preceding modes of being, by a  process which seems to us to involve a beginning, and to ensure an end.  But in the view of Pantheism, properly so-called, the transference of  such a process to the whole Universe is the result of an illusion  suggested by false analogy. For the processes called evolution, though  everywhere operative, affect, each of them, only parts of the infinite  whole of things; and experience cannot possibly afford any justification  for supposing that they affect the Universe itself. Thus, the matter or  energy of which we think we consist, was in existence, every atom of it,  and every element of force, before we were born, and will survive our  apparent death. And the same thing, at least on the Pantheistic view, is  true of every other mode of apparently separate or finite existence.  Therefore no birth of a new nebula ever added a grain of matter or an  impulse of new energy to the Universe. And the final decease of our  solar system, if such an event be in prospect, cannot make any  difference whatever to the infinite balance of forces, of which,  speaking in anthropomorphic and inadequate language, we suppose the  Eternal All to consist.    [Sidenote: Limitation of Scope.]    These observations are not intended to be controversial, but only to  make clear the general sense in which the term Pantheism is here used.  Not that it would be possible at the outset to indicate all that is  implicit in the definition. I only wish to premise plainly that I am not  concerned with any view of the world such as implies or admits that,  whether by process of creation, or emanation, or self-division, or  evolution, the oneness of the Eternal has ever been marred, or anything  other than the being of God has been or can be produced.
