THE AUTHOR      John Meade Falkner was a remarkable character, as he was not only a  scholar and a writer, but a captain of industry as well. Born in 1858,  the son of a clergyman in Wiltshire, he was educated at Marlborough and  Hertford College, Oxford. On leaving the university, he became tutor to  the sons of Sir Andrew Noble, then vice-chairman of the  Armstrong-Whitworth Company; and his ability so much impressed his  employer that in 1885 he was offered a post in the firm. Without  connections or influence in industrial circles, and solely by his  intellect, he rose to be a director in 1901, and finally, in 1915,  chairman of this enormous business. He was actually chairman during the  important years 1915-1920, and remained a director until 1926.    His intellectual energy was so great that throughout his life he found  time for scholarship as well as business. He travelled for his firm in  Europe and South America; and in the intervals of negotiating with  foreign governments studied manuscripts wherever he found a library. His  researches in the Vatican Library were of special importance, and in  connection with them he received a gold medal from the Pope; he was also  decorated by the Italian, Turkish and Japanese governments.    His scholastic interests included archaeology, folklore, palaeography,  mediaeval history, architecture and church music; and he was a collector  of missals. Towards the end of his life he was made an Honorary Fellow  of Hertford College, Oxford, Honorary Reader in Palaeography to Durham  University, and Honorary Librarian to the Chapter Library of Durham  Cathedral, which he left one of the best cathedral libraries in Europe.  He died at Durham in 1932.    Apart from _The Lost Stradivarius_, Falkner was the author of two other  novels, _The Nebuly Coat_ (1903--also published in Penguin Books) and  _Moonfleet_ (1898). He also wrote a History of Oxfordshire, handbooks to  that county and to Berkshire, historical short stories, and some  mediaevalist verse.              THE LOST STRADIVARIUS              Letter from MISS SOPHIA MALTRAVERS    to her Nephew, SIR EDWARD MALTRAVERS,    then a Student at Christ Church, Oxford.      13 Pauncefort Buildings, Bath,    Oct. 21, 1867.      MY DEAR EDWARD,      It was your late father's dying request that certain events which    occurred in his last years should be communicated to you on your coming    of age. I have reduced them to writing, partly from my own recollection,    which is, alas! still too vivid, and partly with the aid of notes taken    at the time of my brother's death. As you are now of full age, I submit    the narrative to you. Much of it has necessarily been exceedingly    painful to me to write, but at the same time I feel it is better that    you should hear the truth from me than garbled stories from others who    did not love your father as I did.      Your loving Aunt,    SOPHIA MALTRAVERS      To Sir Edward Maltravers, Bart.            \"A tale out of season is as music in mourning.\"    --ECCLESIASTICUS xxii. 6.          MISS SOPHIA MALTRAVERS' STORY    CHAPTER I      Your father, John Maltravers, was born in 1820 at Worth, and succeeded  his father and mine, who died when we were still young children. John  was sent to Eton in due course, and in 1839, when he was nineteen years  of age, it was determined that he should go to Oxford. It was intended  at first to enter him at Christ Church; but Dr. Sarsdell, who visited us  at Worth in the summer of 1839, persuaded Mr. Thoresby, our guardian, to  send him instead to Magdalen Hall. Dr. Sarsdell was himself Principal of  that institution, and represented that John, who then exhibited some  symptoms of delicacy, would meet with more personal attention under his  care than he could hope to do in so large a college as Christ Church.  Mr. Thoresby, ever solicitous for his ward's welfare, readily waived  other considerations in favour of an arrangement which he considered  conducive to John's health, and he was accordingly matriculated at  Magdalen Hall in the autumn of 1839.    Dr. Sarsdell had not been unmindful of his promise to look after my  brother, and had secured him an excellent first-floor sitting-room, with  a bedroom adjoining, having an aspect towards New College Lane.    I shall pass over the first two years of my brother's residence at  Oxford, because they have nothing to do with the present story. They  were spent, no doubt, in the ordinary routine of work and recreation  common in Oxford at that period.    From his earliest boyhood he had been passionately devoted to music,  and had attained a considerable proficiency on the violin. In the autumn  term of 1841 he made the acquaintance of Mr. William Gaskell, a very  talented student at New College, and also a more than tolerable  musician. The practice of music was then very much less common at Oxford  than it has since become, and there were none of those societies  existing which now do so much to promote its study among undergraduates.  It was therefore a cause of much gratification to the two young men, and  it afterwards became a strong bond of friendship, to discover that one  was as devoted to the pianoforte as was the other to the violin. Mr.  Gaskell, though in easy circumstances, had not a pianoforte in his  rooms, and was pleased to use a fine instrument by D'Almaine that John  had that term received as a birthday present from his guardian.    From that time the two students were thrown much together, and in the  autumn term of 1841 and Easter term of 1842 practised a variety of music  in John's rooms, he taking the violin part and Mr. Gaskell that for the  pianoforte.    It was, I think, in March 1842 that John purchased for his rooms a piece  of furniture which was destined afterwards to play no unimportant part  in the story I am narrating. This was a very large and low wicker chair  of a form then coming into fashion in Oxford, and since, I am told,  become a familiar object of most college rooms. It was cushioned with a  gaudy pattern of chintz, and bought for new of an upholsterer at the  bottom of the High Street.    Mr. Gaskell was taken by his uncle to spend Easter in Rome, and  obtaining special leave from his college to prolong his travels; did not  return to Oxford till three weeks of the summer term were passed and May  was well advanced. So impatient was he to see his friend that he would  not let even the first evening of his return pass without coming round  to John's rooms. The two young men sat without lights until the night  was late; and Mr. Gaskell had much to narrate of his travels, and spoke  specially of the beautiful music which he had heard at Easter in the  Roman churches. He had also had lessons on the piano from a celebrated  professor of the Italian style, but seemed to have been particularly  delighted with the music of the seventeenth-century composers, of whose  works he had brought back some specimens set for piano and violin.    It was past eleven o'clock when Mr. Gaskell left to return to New  College; but the night was unusually warm, with a moon near the full,  and John sat for some time in a cushioned window-seat before the open  sash thinking over what he had heard about the music of Italy. Feeling  still disinclined for sleep, he lit a single candle and began to turn  over some of the musical works which Mr. Gaskell had left on the table.  His attention was especially attracted to an oblong book, bound in  soiled vellum, with a coat of arms stamped in gilt upon the side. It was  a manuscript copy of some early suites by Graziani for violin and  harpsichord, and was apparently written at Naples in the year 1744, many  years after the death of that composer. Though the ink was yellow and  faded, the transcript had been accurately made, and could be read with  tolerable comfort by an advanced musician in spite of the antiquated  notation.    Perhaps by accident, or perhaps by some mysterious direction which our  minds are incapable of appreciating, his eye was arrested by a suite of  four movements with a _basso continuo_, or figured bass, for the  harpsichord. The other suites in the book were only distinguished by  numbers, but this one the composer had dignified with the name of  \"l'Areopagita.\" Almost mechanically John put the book on his  music-stand, took his violin from its case, and after a moment's tuning  stood up and played the first movement, a lively _Coranto_. The light of  the single candle burning on the table was scarcely sufficient to  illumine the page; the shadows hung in the creases of the leaves, which  had grown into those wavy folds sometimes observable in books made of  thick paper and remaining long shut; and it was with difficulty that he  could read what he was playing. But he felt the strange impulse of the  old-world music urging him forward, and did not even pause to light the  candles which stood ready in their sconces on either side of the desk.  The _Coranto_ was followed by a _Sarabanda_, and the _Sarabanda_ by a  _Gagliarda_. My brother stood playing, with his face turned to the  window, with the room and the large wicker chair of which I have spoken  behind him. The _Gagliarda_ began with a bold and lively air, and as he  played the opening bars, he heard behind him a creaking of the wicker  chair. The sound was a perfectly familiar one--as of some person placing  a hand on either arm of the chair preparatory to lowering himself into  it, followed by another as of the same person being leisurely seated.  But for the tones of the violin, all was silent, and the creaking of the  chair was strangely distinct. The illusion was so complete that my  brother stopped playing suddenly, and turned round expecting that some  late friend of his had slipped in unawares,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14134"],[0,"Akbar, Emperor of India (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team        This book was produced from images scanned by the State Central  Library, Hyderabad, and hosted by the Million Book Project at  http://www.archive.org/        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

And if within the realm of historical  investigation, a more seductive charm lies for him in the analysis of  great personalities than in ascertaining the course of historical  development, then verily may he look about in vain for such  personalities in the antiquity and middle ages of India. Not that the  princely thrones were wanting in great men in ancient India, for we  find abundant traces of them in Hindu folk-lore and poetry, but these  sources do not extend to establishing the realistic element in details  and furnishing life-like portraits of the men themselves. That the  Hindu has ever been but little interested in historical matters is a  generally recognized fact. Religious and philosophical speculations,  dreams of other worlds, of previous and future existences, have  claimed the attention of thoughtful minds to a much greater degree  than has historical reality.      [Footnote A: This essay is art enlarged form of an address delivered    on the occasion of the birthday of King Wilhelm II of Wuerttemberg, on    February 25, 1909.]    The misty myth-woven veil which hangs over persons and events of  earlier times, vanishes at the beginning of the modern era which in  India starts with the Mohammedan conquest, for henceforth the history  of India is written by foreigners. Now we meet with men who take a  decisive part in the fate of India, and they appear as sharply  outlined, even though generally unpleasing, personalities.    Islam has justly been characterized as the caricature of a religion.  Fanaticism and fatalism are two conspicuously irreligious emotions,  and it is exactly these two emotions, which Islam understands how to  arouse in savage peoples, to which it owes the part it has played in  the history of the world, and the almost unprecedented success of its  diffusion in Asia, Africa and Europe.    About 1000 A.D. India was invaded by the Sultan Mahmud of Ghasna.  \"With Mahmud's expedition into India begins one of the most horrible  periods of the history of Hindustan. One monarch dethrones another, no  dynasty continues in power, every accession to the throne is  accompanied by the murder of kinsmen, plundering of cities,  devastation of the lowlands and the slaughter of thousands of men,  women and children of the predecessor's adherents; for five centuries  northwest and northern India literally reeked with the blood of  multitudes.\"[1] Mohammedan dynasties of Afghan, Turkish and Mongolian  origin follow that of Ghasna. This entire period is filled with an  almost boundless series of battles, intrigues, imbroglios and  political revolutions; nearly all events had the one characteristic in  common, that they took place amid murder, pillage and fire.      [Footnote 1: E. Schlagintweit, _Indien in Wort und Bild_, II, 26 f.]    [Illustration: AKBAR, EMPEROR OF INDIA.    From Noer's _Kaiser Akbar_, (Frontispiece to Vol. II).]    The most frightful spectacle throughout these reeking centuries is the  terrible Mongolian prince Timur, a successor of Genghis-Khan, who fell  upon India with his band of assassins in the year 1398 and before his  entry into Delhi the capital, in which he was proclaimed Emperor of  India, caused the hundred thousand prisoners whom he had captured in  his previous battles in the Punjab, to be slaughtered in one single  day, because it was too inconvenient to drag them around with him. So  says Timur himself with shameless frankness in his account of the  expedition, and he further relates that after his entry into Delhi,  all three districts of the city were plundered \"according to the will  of God.\"[2] In 1526 Baber, a descendant of Timur, made his entry into  Delhi and there founded the dominion of the Grand Moguls (i.e., of the  great Mongols). The overthrow of this dynasty was brought about by the  disastrous reign of Baber's successor Aurungzeb, a cruel, crafty and  treacherous despot, who following the example of his ancestor Timur,  spread terror and alarm around him in the second half of the  seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. Even to-day  Hindus may be seen to tremble when they meet the sinister fanatical  glance of a Mohammedan.      [Footnote 2: A. Mueller, _Der Islam im Morgen-und Abendland_, II, 300    f.]    Princes with sympathetic qualities were not entirely lacking in the  seven centuries of Mohammedan dominion in India, and they shine forth  as points of light from the gloomy horror of this time, but they fade  out completely before the luminous picture of the man who governed  India for half a century (1556-1605) and by a wise, gentle and just  reign brought about a season of prosperity such as the land had never  experienced in the millenniums of its history. This man, whose memory  even to-day is revered by the Hindus, was a descendant of Baber, Abul  Fath Jelaleddin Muhammed, known by the surname Akbar \"the Great,\"  which was conferred upon the child even when he was named, and  completely supplanted the name that properly belonged to him. And  truly he justified the epithet, for great, fabulously great, was Akbar  as man, general, statesman and ruler,--all in all a prince who  deserves to be known by every one whose heart is moved by the  spectacle of true human greatness.[3]      [Footnote 3: From the literature on Emperor Akbar the following works    deserve special mention: J. Talboys Wheeler, _The History of India    from the Earliest Ages._ Vol. IV, Pt. I, \"Mussulman Rule,\" London,    1876 (judges Akbar very unfairly in many places, but declares at the    bottom of page 135, \"The reign of Akbar is one of the most important    in the history of India; it is one of the most important in the    history of the world\"); Mountstuart Elphinstone, _History of India,    the Hindu and Mahometan Periods_, with notes and additions by E.B.

Mueller, _Der Islam im Morgen-und Abendland_, Vol. II, Berlin, 1887;    but especially Count F.A. von Noer, _Kaiser Akbar, ein Versuch ueber    die Geschichte Indiens im sechzehnten Jahrhundert_, Vol. I, Leyden,    1880; Vol. II, revised from the author's manuscript by Dr. Gustav von    Buchwald, Leyden, 1885. In the preface to this work the original    sources are listed and described; compare also M. Elphinstone, pp.    536, 537, note 45.]    When we wish to understand a personality we are in the habit of  ascertaining the inherited characteristics, and investigating the  influences exercised upon it by religion, family, environment,  education, youthful impressions, experience, and so forth. Most men  are easily comprehensible as the products of these factors. The more  independent of all such influences, or the more in opposition to them,  a personality develops, the more attractive and interesting will it  appear to us. At the first glance it looks as if the Emperor Akbar had  developed his entire character from himself and by his own efforts in  total independence of all influences which in other cases are thought  to determine the character and nature of a man. A Mohammedan, a  Mongol, a descendant of the monster Timur, the son of a weak incapable  father, born in exile, called when but a lad to the government of a  disintegrated and almost annihilated realm in the India of the  sixteenth century,--which means in an age of perfidy, treachery,  avarice, and self-seeking,--Akbar appears before us as a noble man,  susceptible to all grand and beautiful impressions, conscientious,  unprejudiced, and energetic, who knew how to bring peace and order out  of the confusion of the times, who throughout his reign desired the  furtherance of his subjects' and not of his own interest, who while  increasing the privileges of the Mohammedans, not only also declared  equality of rights for the Hindus but even actualized that equality,  who in every conceivable way sought to conciliate his subjects so  widely at variance with each other in race, customs, and religion, and  who finally when the narrow dogmas of his religion no longer satisfied  him, attained to a purified faith in God, which was independent of all  formulated religions.    A closer observation, however, shows that the contrast is not quite so  harsh between what according to our hypotheses Akbar should have been  as a result of the"]]]
