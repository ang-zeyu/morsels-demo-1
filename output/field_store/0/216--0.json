It became green  everywhere in the first spring, after London ended, so that all the  country looked alike.    The meadows were green, and so was the rising wheat which had been sown,  but which neither had nor would receive any further care. Such arable  fields as had not been sown, but where the last stubble had been  ploughed up, were overrun with couch-grass, and where the short stubble  had not been ploughed, the weeds hid it. So that there was no place  which was not more or less green; the footpaths were the greenest of  all, for such is the nature of grass where it has once been trodden on,  and by-and-by, as the summer came on, the former roads were thinly  covered with the grass that had spread out from the margin.    In the autumn, as the meadows were not mown, the grass withered as it  stood, falling this way and that, as the wind had blown it; the seeds  dropped, and the bennets became a greyish-white, or, where the docks and  sorrel were thick, a brownish-red. The wheat, after it had ripened,  there being no one to reap it, also remained standing, and was eaten by  clouds of sparrows, rooks, and pigeons, which flocked to it and were  undisturbed, feasting at their pleasure. As the winter came on, the  crops were beaten down by the storms, soaked with rain, and trodden upon  by herds of animals.    Next summer the prostrate straw of the preceding year was concealed by  the young green wheat and barley that sprang up from the grain sown by  dropping from the ears, and by quantities of docks, thistles, oxeye  daisies, and similar plants. This matted mass grew up through the  bleached straw. Charlock, too, hid the rotting roots in the fields under  a blaze of yellow flower. The young spring meadow-grass could scarcely  push its way up through the long dead grass and bennets of the year  previous, but docks and thistles, sorrel, wild carrots, and nettles,  found no such difficulty.    Footpaths were concealed by the second year, but roads could be traced,  though as green as the sward, and were still the best for walking,  because the tangled wheat and weeds, and, in the meadows, the long  grass, caught the feet of those who tried to pass through. Year by year  the original crops of wheat, barley, oats, and beans asserted their  presence by shooting up, but in gradually diminished force, as nettles  and coarser plants, such as the wild parsnips, spread out into the  fields from the ditches and choked them.    Aquatic grasses from the furrows and water-carriers extended in the  meadows, and, with the rushes, helped to destroy or take the place of  the former sweet herbage. Meanwhile, the brambles, which grew very fast,  had pushed forward their prickly runners farther and farther from the  hedges till they had now reached ten or fifteen yards. The briars had  followed, and the hedges had widened to three or four times their first  breadth, the fields being equally contracted. Starting from all sides at  once, these brambles and briars in the course of about twenty years met  in the centre of the largest fields.    Hawthorn bushes sprang up among them, and, protected by the briars and  thorns from grazing animals, the suckers of elm-trees rose and  flourished. Sapling ashes, oaks, sycamores, and horse-chestnuts, lifted  their heads. Of old time the cattle would have eaten off the seed leaves  with the grass so soon as they were out of the ground, but now most of  the acorns that were dropped by birds, and the keys that were wafted by  the wind, twirling as they floated, took root and grew into trees. By  this time the brambles and briars had choked up and blocked the former  roads, which were as impassable as the fields.    No fields, indeed, remained, for where the ground was dry, the thorns,  briars, brambles, and saplings already mentioned filled the space, and  these thickets and the young trees had converted most part of the  country into an immense forest. Where the ground was naturally moist,  and the drains had become choked with willow roots, which, when confined  in tubes, grow into a mass like the brush of a fox, sedges and flags and  rushes covered it. Thorn bushes were there, too, but not so tall; they  were hung with lichen. Besides the flags and reeds, vast quantities of  the tallest cow-parsnips or \"gicks\" rose five or six feet high, and the  willow herb with its stout stem, almost as woody as a shrub, filled  every approach.    By the thirtieth year there was not one single open place, the hills  only excepted, where a man could walk, unless he followed the tracks of  wild creatures or cut himself a path. The ditches, of course, had long  since become full of leaves and dead branches, so that the water which  should have run off down them stagnated, and presently spread out into  the hollow places and by the corner of what had once been fields,  forming marshes where the horsetails, flags, and sedges hid the water.    As no care was taken with the brooks, the hatches upon them gradually  rotted, and the force of the winter rains carried away the weak timbers,  flooding the lower grounds, which became swamps of larger size. The  dams, too, were drilled by water-rats, and the streams percolating  through, slowly increased the size of these tunnels till the structure  burst, and the current swept on and added to the floods below. Mill-dams  stood longer, but, as the ponds silted up, the current flowed round and  even through the mill-houses, which, going by degrees to ruin, were in  some cases undermined till they fell.    Everywhere the lower lands adjacent to the streams had become marshes,  some of them extending for miles in a winding line, and occasionally  spreading out to a mile in breadth. This was particularly the case where  brooks and streams of some volume joined the rivers, which were also  blocked and obstructed in their turn, and the two, overflowing, covered  the country around; for the rivers brought down trees and branches,  timbers floated from the shore, and all kinds of similar materials,  which grounded in the shallows or caught against snags, and formed huge  piles where there had been weirs.    Sometimes, after great rains, these piles swept away the timbers of the  weir, driven by the irresistible power of the water, and then in its  course the flood, carrying the balks before it like battering rams,  cracked and split the bridges of solid stone which the ancients had  built. These and the iron bridges likewise were overthrown, and  presently quite disappeared, for the very foundations were covered with  the sand and gravel silted up.    Thus, too, the sites of many villages and towns that anciently existed  along the rivers, or on the lower lands adjoining, were concealed by the  water and the mud it brought with it. The sedges and reeds that arose  completed the work and left nothing visible, so that the mighty  buildings of olden days were by these means utterly buried. And, as has  been proved by those who have dug for treasures, in our time the very  foundations are deep beneath the earth, and not to be got at for the  water that oozes into the shafts that they have tried to sink through  the sand and mud banks.    From an elevation, therefore, there was nothing visible but endless  forest and marsh. On the level ground and plains the view was limited to  a short distance, because of the thickets and the saplings which had now  become young trees. The downs only were still partially open, yet it was  not convenient to walk upon them except in the tracks of animals,  because of the long grass which, being no more regularly grazed upon by  sheep, as was once the case, grew thick and tangled. Furze, too, and  heath covered the slopes, and in places vast quantities of fern. There  had always been copses of fir and beech and nut-tree covers, and these  increased and spread, while bramble, briar, and hawthorn extended around  them.    By degrees the trees of the vale seemed as it were to invade and march  up the hills, and, as we see in our time, in many places the downs are  hidden altogether with a stunted kind of forest. But all the above  happened in the time of the first generation. Besides these things a  great physical change took place; but before I speak of that, it will be  best to relate what effects were produced upon animals and men.    In the first years after the fields were left to themselves, the fallen  and over-ripe corn crops became the resort of innumerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13962"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 455, September 20, 1884 (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 455            NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 20, 1884    Scientific American Supplement.

The spirited view herewith presented, representing the \"Fall of the  Giraffe\" before the rifle of a sportsman, we take from the _Illustrated  London News_. Hunting the giraffe has long been a favorite sport among the  more adventurous of British sportsmen, its natural range being all the  wooded parts of eastern, central, and southern Africa, though of late  years it has been greatly thinned out before the settlements advancing  from the Cape of Good Hope.    [Illustration: THE FALL OF THE GIRAFFE.]    The characteristics of this singular animal are in some particulars those  of the camel, the ox, and the antelope. Its eyes are beautiful, extremely  large, and so placed that the animal can see much of what is passing on  all sides, and even behind it, so that it is approached with the greatest  difficulty. The animal when full grown attains sometimes a height of  fifteen to seventeen feet. It feeds on the leaves and twigs of trees  principally, its immense length of legs and height at the withers  rendering it difficult for the animal to graze on an even surface. It is  not easily overtaken except by a swift horse, but when surprised or run  down it can defend itself with considerable vigor by kicking, thus, it is  said, often tiring out and beating off the lion. It was formerly almost  universally believed that the fore legs were longer than the hinder ones,  but in fact the hind legs are the longer by about one inch, the error  having been caused by the great development and height of the withers, to  give a proper base to the long neck and towering head. The color varies a  good deal, the head being generally a reddish brown, and the neck, back,  and sides marked with tessellated, rust colored spots with narrow white  divisions. Many specimens have been brought to this country, the animal  being extremely docile in confinement, feeding from the hand, and being  very friendly to those who are kind to it.           *       *       *       *       *    An experiment has been made in Vienna which proves that even with  incandescent lights special precautions must be taken to avoid any risk of  fire. A lamp having been enveloped with paper and lighted by a current,  the heat generated was sufficient to set fire to the paper, which burnt  out and caused the lamp to explode.           *       *       *       *       *          THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH AS SHOWN BY DEEP MINES.      At a recent meeting of the American Society of Civil Engineers,  observations on the temperature of the earth, as shown by deep mines, were  presented by Messrs. Hamilton Smith, Jr., and Edward B Dorsey. Mr. Smith  said that the temperature of the earth varies very greatly at different  localities and in different geological formations. There are decided  exceptions to the general law that the temperature increased with the  depth. At the New Almaden quicksilver mine, in California, at a depth of  about 600 feet the temperature was very high--some 115 degrees; but in the  deepest part of the same mine, 1,800 feet below the surface and 500 feet  below sea level, the temperature is very pleasant, probably less than 80  degrees. At the Eureka mines, in California, the air 1,200 feet below the  surface appears nearly as cool as 100 feet below the surface. The normal  temperature of the earth at a depth of 50 or 60 feet is probably near the  mean annual temperature of the air at the particular place. At the  Comstock mines, some years since, the miners could remain but a few  moments at a time, on account of the heat. Ice water was given them as an  experiment; it produced no ill effects, but the men worked to much better  advantage; and since that time, ice water is furnished in all these mines,  and drunk with apparently no bad results.    Mr. E.B. Dorsey said that the mines on the Comstock vein, Nevada, were  exceptionally hot. At depths of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet, the thermometer  placed in a freshly drilled hole will show 130 degrees. Very large bodies  of water have run for years at 155 degrees, and smaller bodies at 170  degrees. The temperature of the air is kept down to 110 degrees by forcing  in fresh air cooled over ice.    Captain Wheeler, U.S. Engineers, estimated the heat extracted annually  from the Comstock by means of the water pumped out and cold air forced in,  as equal to that generated by the combustion of 55,560 tons of anthracite  coal or 97,700 cords of wood. Observations were then given upon  temperature at every 100 feet in the Forman shaft of the Overman mine,  running from 53 degrees at a depth of 100 feet to 121.2 degrees at a  depth of 2,300 feet. The temperature increased:        100 to 1,000 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 29 feet.      100 to 1,800 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 30.5 feet.      100 to 2,300 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 32.3 feet.    A table was presented giving the temperatures of a large number of deep  mines, tunnels, and artesian wells. The two coolest mines or tunnels are  in limestone, namely, Chanarcillo mines and Mont Cenis tunnel; and the two  hottest are in trachyte and the \"coal measures,\" namely, the Comstock  mines in trachyte and the South Balgray in the \"coal measures.\" Mr. Dorsey  considered that experience showed that limestone was the coolest  formation.           *       *       *       *       *          GALLISIN, AN UNFERMENTABLE SUBSTANCE IN STARCH SUGAR.      C. Schmitt and A. Coblenzl have made a careful investigation of the  unfermentable substances found in commercial starch sugars, and have  succeeded in isolating a definite compound, to which they give the name  gallisin. The method of separation and purification which they made use of  is as follows: 5 kilogrammes of commercial starch sugar were allowed to  ferment. At a temperature of 18-20 deg. C. and with a solution containing 20  per cent. the fermentation was complete in five to six days. It was  filtered; the perfectly clear, almost colorless, liquid evaporated as far  as possible on the water-bath, and the sirup while still warm brought into  a good-sized flask. The sirup was then well shaken with a large excess of  absolute alcohol, when it became viscous, but did not mix with the  alcohol. The latter was poured off, replaced by fresh alcohol, and again  shaken. When this shaking with alcohol has been repeated several times,  the sirup is finally changed to a yellowish-gray mass. This is now brought  into a large mortar, and rubbed up under a mixture of alcohol and ether.  After some time the whole mass is transformed into a gray powder. It is  quickly filtered off with the aid of an aspirator, washed with alcohol and  then with ether, and brought under a desiccator with concentrated  sulphuric acid. In order to purify the substance, it is dissolved in water  and treated with bone-black. The solution is then evaporated to a sirup,  and this poured into a mixture of equal parts of anhydrous alcohol and  ether. In this way the new compound is obtained as a very fine, pure white"]]]
