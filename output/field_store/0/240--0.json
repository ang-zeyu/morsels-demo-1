BY  G. MASPERO, D.C.L. OXON.  MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE; PROFESSOR AT THE COLLEGE DE FRANCE;  EX-DIRECTOR GENERAL OF EGYPTIAN MUSEUMS.    _TRANSLATED BY_    AMELIA B. EDWARDS.    _NEW EDITION, REVISED AND ENLARGED BY THE AUTHOR_.    With Three Hundred and Nine Illustrations.      1895.          PREFACE TO THE FOURTH AND REVISED EDITION.    Notwithstanding the fact that Egyptology is now recognised as a science, an  exact and communicable knowledge of whose existence and scope it behoves  all modern culture to take cognisance, this work of M. Maspero still  remains the Handbook of Egyptian Archaeology. But Egyptology is as yet in  its infancy; whatever their age, Egyptologists will long die young. Every  year, almost every month, fresh material for the study is found, fresh  light is thrown upon it by the progress of excavation, exploration, and  research. Hence it follows that, in the course of a few years, the standard  text-books require considerable addition and modification if they are to be  of the greatest value to students, who must always start from the foremost  vantage-ground.    The increasing demand for the _Egyptian Archaeology_ by English and  American tourists, as well as students, decided the English publishers to  issue a new edition in as light and portable a form as possible. This  edition is carefully corrected, and contains the enlarged letterpress and  many fresh illustrations necessary for incorporating within the book  adequate accounts of the main archaeological results of recent Egyptian  excavations. M. Maspero has himself revised the work, indicated all the  numerous additions, and qualified the expression of any views which he has  seen reason to modify in the course of his researches during the past eight  years. By the headings of the pages, the descriptive titles of the  illustrations, and a minute revision of the index, much has been done to  facilitate the use of the volume as a book of reference. In that capacity  it will be needed by the student long after he first makes acquaintance  with its instructive and abundant illustrations and its luminous  condensation of the archaeological facts and conclusions which have been  elucidated by Egyptology through the devotion of many an arduous lifetime  during the present century, and, not least, by the unremitting labours of  M. Maspero.    _April, 1895_.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.    To put this book into English, and thus to hand it on to thousands who  might not otherwise have enjoyed it, has been to me a very congenial and  interesting task. It would be difficult, I imagine, to point to any work of  its scope and character which is better calculated to give lasting delight  to all classes of readers. For the skilled archaeologist, its pages contain  not only new facts, but new views and new interpretations; while to those  who know little, or perhaps nothing, of the subjects under discussion, it  will open a fresh and fascinating field of study. It is not enough to say  that a handbook of Egyptian Archaeology was much needed, and that Professor  Maspero has given us exactly what we required. He has done much more than  this. He has given us a picturesque, vivacious, and highly original volume,  as delightful as if it were not learned, and as instructive as if it were  dull.    As regards the practical side of Archaeology, it ought to be unnecessary to  point out that its usefulness is strictly parallel with the usefulness of  public museums. To collect and exhibit objects of ancient art and industry  is worse than idle if we do not also endeavour to disseminate some  knowledge of the history of those arts and industries, and of the processes  employed by the artists and craftsmen of the past. Archaeology, no less  than love, \"adds a precious seeing to the eye\"; and without that gain of  mental sight, the treasures of our public collections are regarded by the  general visitor as mere \"curiosities\"--flat and stale for the most part,  and wholly unprofitable.    I am much indebted to Mr. W.M. Flinders Petrie, author of _The Pyramids and  Temples of Gizeh_, for kindly translating the section on \"Pyramids,\" which  is entirely from his pen. I have also to thank him for many valuable notes  on subjects dealt with in the first three chapters. To avoid confusion, I  have numbered these notes, and placed them at the end of the volume.    My acknowledgments are likewise due to Professor Maspero for the care with  which he has read the proof-sheets of this version of his work. In  departing from his system of orthography (and that of Mr. Petrie) I have  been solely guided by the necessities of English readers. I foresee that  _Egyptian Archaeology_ will henceforth be the inseparable companion of all  English-speaking travellers who visit the Valley of the Nile; hence I have  for the most part adopted the spelling of Egyptian proper names as given by  the author of \"Murray's Handbook for Egypt.\"    Touching my own share in the present volume, I will only say that I have  tried to present Professor Maspero's inimitable French in the form of  readable English, rather than in a strictly word-for-word translation; and  that with the hope of still further extending the usefulness of the book, I  have added some foot-note references.

single Letters and Combinations.      39. _Name the Consonant letters._    B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z.      40. _Name the Consonant Combinations._    Th, Sh, Ch, Zh, Wh, and Ng.      41. _Name the two Orders of the Consonants._    Mutes and Semi-vowels.      42. _What are Mutes?_    Those letters which admit of no escape of breath while the organs            of speech are in contact.      43. _Name the Mutes._    B, D, K, P, T, and C and G hard.      44. _What other term is often applied to the Mutes?_    Close Consonant.      45. _What are Semi-vowels?_    Those letters that admit of an escape of breath while the organs            of speech are in contact.      46. _Name the Semi-vowels._    F, H, J, L, M, N, R, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, and C and G soft.      47. _Are the Combinations Mutes or Semi-vowels?_    They are all Semi-vowels.      48. _What letters are called Nasals?_    M, N, and Ng.      49. _What other term is often applied to the Semi-vowels?_    Loose Consonant.      50. _What letters are called Liquids?_    L, M, N, and R.      51. _Why are the Liquids so called?_    Because of their flowing sound, which readily unites with the            sound of other letters.      52. _What are Sibilants?_    Letters which have a hissing sound; as, S and Z.      53. _What letter is called the Mute Sibilant?_    The letter X.      54. _What letters represent no sound of their own?_    C, Q, and X.      55. _What are these letters called?_    Redundant letters.      56. _Why are they so named?_    Because they are not necessary for the completion of the Alphabet.      57. _By what letters are the sounds of C represented?_    K and S.      58. _What letters represent the sound of Q?_    Kw.      59. _What letters represent the sound X?_    Ks.      60. _What letters of themselves form words?_    A, I, and O.      61. _Spell all of the Consonants._    Bee, Cee, Dee, Eff, Gee, Aitch, Jay, Kay, Ell, Em, En, Pee,            Kw, Ar, Ess, Tee, Vee, Double-u, Ex, Wy, and Zee.--_Goold            Brown_.      62. _What letters are called the Twins?_    Q and U.      63. _Why so called?_    Because Q is always followed by U in English spelling.      64. _Is there any exception to this rule?_    The word LEECLERCQ is sometimes given as an example, but in            English it is spelled LEECLERC.      65. _What is meant by style of letters?_    Different type; as, Roman, Script, Italics, etc.      66. _How many forms have letters?_    Two.      67. _What are they?_"]]]
