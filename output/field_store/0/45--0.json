[2]    One day a Monkey met a Turtle on the road, and asked, \"Where are  you going?\"    \"I am going to find something to eat, for I have had no food for  three whole days,\" said the Turtle.    \"I too am hungry,\" said the Monkey; \"and since we are both hungry,  let us go together and hunt food for our stomachs' sake.\"    They soon became good friends and chatted along the way, so that the  time passed quickly. Before they had gone far, the Monkey saw a large  bunch of yellow bananas on a tree at a distance.    \"Oh, what a good sight that is!\" cried he. \"Don't you see the bananas  hanging on that banana-tree? [pointing with his first finger toward  the tree]. They are fine! I can taste them already.\"    But the Turtle was short-sighted and could not see them. By and by  they came near the tree, and then he saw them. The two friends were  very glad. The mere sight of the ripe, yellow fruit seemed to assuage  their hunger.    But the Turtle could not climb the tree, so he agreed that the Monkey  should go up alone and should throw some of the fruit down to him. The  Monkey was up in a flash; and, seating himself comfortably, he began  to eat the finest of the fruit, and forgot to drop any down to the  Turtle waiting below. The Turtle called for some, but the Monkey  pretended not to hear. He ate even the peelings, and refused to drop  a bit to his friend, who was patiently begging under the tree.    At last the Turtle became angry, very angry indeed: \"so he thought  he would revenge\" (as my informant puts it). While the Monkey was  having a good time, and filling his stomach, the Turtle gathered  sharp, broken pieces of glass, and stuck them, one by one, all around  the banana-tree. Then he hid himself under a cocoanut-shell not far  away. This shell had a hole in the top to allow the air to enter. That  was why the Turtle chose it for his hiding-place.    The Monkey could not eat all the bananas, for there were enough to  last a good-sized family several days; \"but he ate all what he can,\"  and by and by came down the tree with great difficulty, for the glass  was so sharp that it cut even the tough hand of the Monkey. He had a  hard time, and his hands were cut in many places. The Turtle thought  he had his revenge, and was not so angry as before.    But the Monkey was now very angry at the trick that had been played  upon him, and began looking for the Turtle, intending to kill him. For  some time he could not find his foe, and, being very tired, he sat  down on the cocoanut-shell near by. His weariness increased his anger  at the Turtle very much.    He sat on the shell for a long time, suffering from his wounds, and  wondering where to find the Turtle,--his former friend, but now his  enemy. Because of the disturbance of the shell, the Turtle inside could  not help making a noise. This the Monkey heard; and he was surprised,  for he could not determine whence the sound came. At last he lifted  his stool, and there found his foe the Turtle.    \"Ha! Here you are!\" he cried. \"Pray now, for it is the end of your  life.\"    He picked up the Turtle by the neck and carried him near the riverbank,  where he meant to kill him. He took a mortar and pestle, and built a  big fire, intending to pound him to powder or burn him to death. When  everything was ready, he told the Turtle to choose whether he should  die in the fire or be \"grounded\" in the mortar. The Turtle begged for  his life; but when he found it was in vain, he prayed to be thrown  into the fire or ground in the mortar,--anything except be thrown  into the water. On hearing this, the Monkey picked the Turtle up  in his bleeding fingers, and with all his might threw him into the  middle of the stream.    Then the Turtle was very glad. He chuckled at his own wit, and laughed  at the foolishness of the Monkey. He came up to the surface of the  water and mocked at the Monkey, saying, \"This is my home. The water  is my home.\"    This made the Monkey so angry that he lost his self-possession  entirely. He jumped into the middle of the river after the Turtle,  and was drowned.    Since that day monkeys and turtles have been bitter enemies.      CHAPTER 2    How the Farmer Deceived the Demon. [3]    Very many years ago, in a far-away land where the trees never changed  their green leaves and where the birds always sang, there lived  on an island a farmer with a large family. Though all alone on the  island and knowing nothing of people in the outer world, they were  always happy,--as happy as the laughing rills that rippled past their  home. They had no great wealth, depending from year to year on the  crops which the father raised. They needed no money, for they lacked  nothing; and they never sold their produce, for no people were near  to buy.    One day in the middle of the year, after the crops were well started,  a loud, unusual roar was heard. Suddenly a stiff gale blew up from  the southwest, and with it came clouds which quickly hid the entire  sky. The day turned to night. The birds ceased to sing and went to  their nests. The wild beasts ran to their caves. The family sought  shelter in the house from a heavy downpour of rain which continued  for many days and nights. So long did it last that they became very  anxious about the condition of things around them.    On the eighth day the birds again began to sing, and the sun was,  as usual, bright. The farmer arose early and went out to look at his  fields, but, lo! his crop was all destroyed. He went back to the house  and told the family that the water-god was angry and had washed away  all that he had hoped to have for the coming year.    What were they to do? The supply in the house was getting low and it  was too late to raise another crop. The father worried night and day,  for he did not know how he could keep his children from starvation.    One day he made a long journey and came into a place that was strange  to him. He had never before seen the like of it. But in the midst of  a broad meadow he saw a tree with spreading branches like an elm,  and as his legs and back were stiff from walking, he went over and  sat down under it. Presently, looking up, he discovered that on the  tree were large red fruits. He climbed up and brought "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#1)"],[1,"HERO-MYTHS.    A STUDY IN THE NATIVE RELIGIONS  OF THE WESTERN CONTINENT.    BY    DANIEL G. BRINTON, M.D.,    MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY; THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN  SOCIETY; THE NUMISMATIC AND ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY OF PHILA., ETC.; AUTHOR OF  \"THE MYTHS OF THE NEW WORLD;\" \"THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT.\" ETC.      1882.      TO    ELI K. PRICE, ESQ.,    PRESIDENT OF THE NUMISMATIC AND ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA, WHOSE  ENLIGHTENED INTEREST HAS FOR MANY YEARS, AND IN MANY WAYS, FURTHERED THE  PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE, THIS VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE  AUTHOR.          PREFACE.      This little volume is a contribution to the comparative study of  religions. It is an endeavor to present in a critically correct light some  of the fundamental conceptions which are found in the native beliefs of  the tribes of America.    So little has heretofore been done in this field that it has yielded a  very scanty harvest for purposes of general study. It has not yet even  passed the stage where the distinction between myth and tradition has been  recognized. Nearly all historians continue to write about some of the  American hero-gods as if they had been chiefs of tribes at some  undetermined epoch, and the effort to trace the migrations and  affiliations of nations by similarities in such stories is of almost daily  occurrence. How baseless and misleading all such arguments must be, it is  one of my objects to set forth.    At the same time I have endeavored to be temperate in applying the  interpretations of mythologists. I am aware of the risk one runs in  looking at every legend as a light or storm myth. My guiding principle has  been that when the same, and that a very extraordinary, story is told by  several tribes wholly apart in language and location, then the  probabilities are enormous that it is not a legend but a myth, and must be  explained as such. It is a spontaneous production of the mind, not a  reminiscence of an historic event.    The importance of the study of myths has been abundantly shown of recent  years, and the methods of analyzing them have been established with  satisfactory clearness.    The time has long since passed, at least among thinking men, when the  religious legends of the lower races were looked upon as trivial fables,  or as the inventions of the Father of Lies. They are neither the one nor  the other. They express, in image and incident, the opinions of these  races on the mightiest topics of human thought, on the origin and destiny  of man, his motives for duty and his grounds of hope, and the source,  history and fate of all external nature. Certainly the sincere expressions  on these subjects of even humble members of the human race deserve our  most respectful heed, and it may be that we shall discover in their crude  or coarse narrations gleams of a mental light which their proud Aryan  brothers have been long in coming to, or have not yet reached.    The prejudice against all the lower faiths inspired by the claim of  Christianity to a monopoly of religious truth--a claim nowise set up by  its founder--has led to extreme injustice toward the so-called heathen  religions. Little effort has been made to distinguish between their good  and evil tendencies, or even to understand them. I do not know of a single  instance on this continent of a thorough and intelligent study of a native  religion made by a Protestant missionary.    So little real work has been done in American mythology that very diverse  opinions as to its interpretation prevail among writers. Too many of them  apply to it facile generalizations, such as \"heliolatry,\" \"animism,\"  \"ancestral worship,\" \"primitive philosophizing,\" and think that such a  sesame will unloose all its mysteries. The result has been that while each  satisfies himself, he convinces no one else.    I have tried to avoid any such bias, and have sought to discover the  source of the myths I have selected, by close attention to two points:  first, that I should obtain the precise original form of the myth by a  rigid scrutiny of authorities; and, secondly, that I should bring to bear  upon it modern methods of mythological and linguistic analysis.    The first of these requirements has given me no small trouble. The sources  of American history not only differ vastly in merit, but many of them are  almost inaccessible. I still have by me a list of books of the first order  of importance for these studies, which I have not been able to find in any  public or private library in the United States.    I have been free in giving references for the statements in the text. The  growing custom among historians of omitting to do this must be deplored in  the interests of sound learning. It is better to risk the charge of  pedantry than to leave at fault those who wish to test an author's  accuracy or follow up the line of investigation he indicates.    On the other hand, I have exercised moderation in drawing comparisons with  Aryan, Semitic, Egyptian and other Old World mythologies. It would have  been easy to have noted apparent similarities to a much greater extent.  But I have preferred to leave this for those who write upon general  comparative mythology. Such parallelisms, to reach satisfactory results,  should be attempted only by those who have studied the Oriental religions  in their original sources, and thus are not to be deceived by superficial  resemblances.    The term \"comparative mythology\" reaches hardly far enough to cover all  that I have aimed at. The professional mythologist thinks he has completed  his task when he has traced a myth through its transformations in story  and language back to the natural phenomena of which it was the expression.  This external history is essential. But deeper than that lies the study of  the influence of the myth on the individual and national mind, on the  progress and destiny of those who believed it, in other words, its true  _religious_ import. I have endeavored, also, to take some account of this.    The usual statement is that tribes in the intellectual condition of those  I am dealing with rest their religion on a worship of external phenomena.  In contradiction to this, I advance various arguments to show that their  chief god was not identified with any objective natural process, but was  human in nature, benignant in character, loved rather than feared, and  that his worship carried with it the germs of the development of  benevolent emotions and sound ethical principles.    _Media, Pa., Oct., 1882._          CONTENTS.
