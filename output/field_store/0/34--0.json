I have never seen  a city in the world so beautiful as Merimna seemed to me when first  I dreamed of it.  It was a marvel of spires and figures of bronze,  and marble fountains, and trophies of fabulous wars, and broad  streets given over wholly to the Beautiful.  Right through the  centre of the city there went an avenue fifty strides in width, and  along each side of it stood likenesses in bronze of the Kings of all  the countries that the people of Merimna had ever known.  At the end  of that avenue was a colossal chariot with three bronze horses  driven by the winged figure of Fame, and behind her in the chariot  the huge form of Welleran, Merimna's ancient hero, standing with  extended sword.  So urgent was the mien and attitude of Fame, and so  swift the pose of the horses, that you had sworn that the chariot  was instantly upon you, and that its dust already veiled the faces  of the Kings.  And in the city was a mighty hall wherein were stored  the trophies of Merimna's heroes.  Sculptured it was and domed, the  glory of the art of masons a long while dead, and on the summit of  the dome the image of Rollory sat gazing across the Cyresian  mountains towards the wide lands beyond, the lands that knew his  sword.  And beside Rollory, like an old nurse, the figure of Victory  sat, hammering into a golden wreath of laurels for his head the  crowns of fallen Kings.    Such was Merimna, a city of sculptured Victories and warriors of  bronze.  Yet in the time of which I write the art of war had been  forgotten in Merimna, and the people almost slept.  To and fro and  up and down they would walk through the marble streets, gazing at  memorials of the things achieved by their country's swords in the  hands of those that long ago had loved Merimna well.  Almost they  slept, and dreamed of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory,  Akanax, and young Iraine.  Of the lands beyond the mountains that  lay all round about them they knew nothing, save that they were the  theatre of the terrible deeds of Welleran, that he had done with his  sword.  Long since these lands had fallen back into the possession  of the nations that had been scourged by Merimna's armies.  Nothing  now remained to Merimna's men save their inviolate city and the  glory of the remembrance of their ancient fame.  At night they would  place sentinels far out in the desert, but these always slept at  their posts dreaming of Rollory, and three times every night a guard  would march around the city clad in purple, bearing lights and  singing songs of Welleran.  Always the guard went unarmed, but as the  sound of their song went echoing across the plain towards the  looming mountains, the desert robbers would hear the name of  Welleran and steal away to their haunts.  Often dawn would come  across the plain, shimmering marvellously upon Merimna's spires,  abashing all the stars, and find the guard still singing songs of  Welleran, and would change the colour of their purple robes and pale  the lights they bore.  But the guard would go back leaving the  ramparts safe, and one by one the sentinels in the plain would awake  from dreaming of Rollory and shuffle back into the city quite cold.  Then something of the menace would pass away from the faces of the  Cyresian mountains, that from the north and the west and the south  lowered upon Merimna, and clear in the morning the statues and the  pillars would arise in the old inviolate city.  You would wonder that  an unarmed guard and sentinels that slept could defend a city that  was stored with all the glories of art, that was rich in gold and  bronze, a haughty city that had erst oppressed its neighbours, whose  people had forgotten the art of war.  Now this is the reason that,  though all her other lands had long been taken from her, Merimna's  city was safe.  A strange thing was believed or feared by the fierce  tribes beyond the mountains, and it was credited among them that at  certain stations round Merimna's ramparts there still rode Welleran,  Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.  Yet it was  close on a hundred years since Iraine, the youngest of Merimna's  heroes, fought his last battle with the tribes.    Sometimes indeed there arose among the tribes young men who doubted  and said: 'How may a man for ever escape death?'    But graver men answered them: 'Hear us, ye whose wisdom has  discerned so much, and discern for us how a man may escape death  when two score horsemen assail him with their swords, all of them  sworn to kill him, and all of them sworn upon their country's gods;  as often Welleran hath.  Or discern for us how two men alone may  enter a walled city by night, and bring away from it that city's  king, as did Soorenard and Mommolek.  Surely men that have escaped  so many swords and so many sleety arrows shall escape the years and  Time.'    And the young men were humbled and became silent.  Still, the  suspicion grew.  And often when the sun set on the Cyresian  mountains, men in Merimna discerned the forms of savage tribesmen  black against the light, peering towards the city.    All knew in Merimna that the figures round the ramparts were only  statues of stone, yet even there a hope lingered among a few that  some day their old heroes would come again, for certainly none had  ever seen them die.  Now it had been the wont of these six warriors  of old, as each received his last wound and knew it to be mortal, to  ride away to a certain deep ravine and cast his body in, as  somewhere I have read great elephants do, hiding their bones away  from lesser beasts.  It was a ravine steep and narrow even at the  ends, a great cleft into which no man could come by any path.  There  rode Welleran alone, panting hard; and there later rode Soorenard  and Mommolek, Mommolek with a mortal wound upon him not to return,  but Soorenard was unwounded and rode back alone from leaving his  dear friend resting among the mighty bones of Welleran.  And there  rode Soorenard, when his day was come, with Rollory and Akanax, and  Rollory rode in the middle and Soorenard and Akanax on either side.  And the long ride was a hard and weary thing for Soorenard and  Akanax, for they both had mortal wounds; but the long ride was easy  for Rollory, for he was dead.  So the bones of these five heroes  whitened in an enemy's land, and very still they were, though they  had troubled cities, and none knew where they lay saving only  Iraine, the young captain, who was but twenty-five when Mommolek,  Rollory, and Akanax rode away.  And among them were strewn their  saddles and their bridles, and all the accoutrements of their  horses, lest any man should ever find them afterwards and say in  some foreign city: 'Lo! the bridles or the saddles of Merimna's  captains, taken in war,' but their beloved trusty horses they turned  free.    Forty years afterwards, in the hour of a great victory, his last  wound came upon Iraine, and the wound was terrible and would not  close.  And Iraine was the last of the captains, and rode away  alone.  It was a long way to the dark ravine, and Iraine feared that  he would never come to the resting-place of the old heroes, and he  urged his horse on swiftly, and clung to the saddle with his hands.  And often as he rode he fell asleep, and dreamed of earlier days,  and of the times when he first rode forth to the great wars of  Welleran, and of the time when Welleran first spake to him, and of  the faces of Welleran's comrades when they led charges in the  battle.  And ever as he awoke a great longing arose in his soul as  it hovered on his body's brink, a longing to lie among the bones of  the old heroes.  At last when he saw the dark ravine making a scar  across the plain, the soul of Iraine slipped out through his great  wound and spread its wings, and pain departed from the poor hacked  body, and, still urging his horse forward, Iraine died.  But the old  true horse cantered on till suddenly he saw before him the dark  ravine and put his forefeet out on the very edge of it and stopped.  Then the body of Iraine came toppling forward over the right  shoulder of the horse, and his bones mingle and rest as the years go  by with the bones of Merimna's heroes.    Now there was a little boy in Merimna named Rold.  I saw him first,  I, the dreamer, that sit before my fire asleep, I saw him first as  his mother led him through the great hall where stand the trophies  of Merimna's heroes.  He was five years old, and they stood before  the great glass casket wherein lay the sword of Welleran, and his  mother said: 'The sword of Welleran.'  And Rold said: 'What should a  man do with the sword of Welleran?'  And his mother answered: 'Men  look at the sword and remember Welleran.'  And they went on and  stood before the great red cloak of Welleran, and the child said:  'Why did Welleran wear this great red cloak?' And his mother  answered: 'It was the way of Welleran.'    When Rold was a little older he stole out of his mother's house  quite in the middle of the night when all the world was still, and  Merimna asleep dreaming of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory,  Akanax, and young Iraine.  And he went down to the ramparts to hear  the purple guard go by singing of Welleran.  And the purple guard  came by with lights, all singing in the stillness, and dark shapes  out in the desert turned and fled.  And Rold went back again to his  mother's house with a great yearning towards the name of Welleran,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10814"],[0,"Legends, Tales and Poems (#1)"],[1,"Legends, Tales and Poems    [Illustration: After an etching by B.

Fondness for good literature should be stimulated from the very first,  and the quaint tales and legends of old Spain contained in this  edition, told, as they are, in a most fascinating style, are well  adapted to captivate the student's interest and to lead him to  investigate further the rich mine of Spanish literature. Becquer's  poetry is no less pleasing than his prose, and not much more difficult  to read. With the aid of the ample treatise on Spanish versification  contained in the introduction, the student will be enabled to  appreciate the harmony and rhythm of Becquer's verse, and in all  subsequent reading of Spanish poetry he will find this treatise a  convenient and valuable work of reference.    The Life of Becquer, though concise, is perhaps the most complete that  has yet been published, for it embodies all the data given by previous  biographers and a certain number of facts gathered by the writer at  the time of his last visit to Spain (in 1905-1906), from friends of  Becquer who were then living.    The vocabulary has been made sufficiently complete to free the notes  from that too frequent translation of words or phrases which often  encumbers them.    The notes have been printed in the only convenient place for them, at  the bottom of each page, and will be found to be as complete and  definite as possible on geographical, biographical, historical, or  other points that may not be familiar to the student or the teacher.  All grammatical or syntactical matter, unless of a difficult or  peculiar character, has been omitted, while the literary citations  that abound will, it is hoped, stimulate the student to do further  reading and to make literary comparisons of his own.    It remains for the editor to express his profound gratitude to the  following gentlemen for their aid in collecting facts regarding  Becquer and for their encouragement of this work: the Exc^{mo} Sr.  Conde de las Navas, the Exc^{mo} Sr. Licenciado D. Jose Gestoso y  Perez, and the Exc^{mo} Sr. D. Francisco de Laiglesia. It is his  pleasure also to convey his thanks to Professor George L. Burr of  Cornell University for aid in certain of the historical notes, and  most especially to gratefully acknowledge his indebtedness to the aid,  or rather collaboration, of Mr. Arthur Gordon of Cornell University,  and Mr. W. R. Price of the High School of Commerce, New York City.      EVERETT WARD OLMSTED    CORNELL UNIVERSITY    Ithaca, N.Y.

Two or three leafy white poplars,  intertwining their branches, protect the spot from the rays of the  sun, which rarely succeeds in slipping through them. Their leaves  produce a soft and pleasing murmur as the wind stirs them and causes  them to appear now silver, now green, according to the point from  which it blows. A willow bathes its roots in the current of the  stream, toward which it leans as though bowed by an invisible weight,  and all about are multitudes of reeds and yellow lilies, such as grow  spontaneously at the edges of springs and streams.    \"When I was a boy of fourteen or fifteen, and my soul was overflowing  with numberless longings, with pure thoughts and with that infinite  hope that is the most precious jewel of youth, when I deemed myself a  poet, when my imagination was full of those pleasing tales of the  classic world, and Rioja in his _silvas_ to the flowers, Herrera in  his tender elegies, and all my Seville singers, the Penates of my  special literature, spoke to me continually of the majestic Betis, the  river of nymphs, naiads, and poets, which, crowned with belfries and  laurels, flows to the sea from a crystal amphora, how often, absorbed  in the contemplation of my childish dreams, I would go and sit upon  its bank, and there, where the poplars protected me with their shadow,  would give rein to my fancies, and conjure up one of those impossible  dreams in which the very skeleton of death appeared before my eyes in  splendid, fascinating garb! I used to dream then of a happy,  independent life, like that of the bird, which is born to sing, and  receives its food from God. I used to dream of that tranquil life of  the poet, which glows with a soft light from generation to generation.  I used to dream that the city that saw my birth would one day swell  with pride at my name, adding it to the brilliant list of her  illustrious sons, and, when death should put an end to my existence,  that they would lay me down to dream the golden dream of immortality  on the banks of the Betis, whose praises I should have sung in  splendid odes, and in that very spot where I used to go so often to  hear the sweet murmur of its waves. A white stone with a cross and my  name should be my only monument.    \"The white poplars, swaying night and day above my grave, should seem  to utter prayers for my soul in the rustling of their green and silver  leaves. In them the birds should come and nest, that they might sing  at dawn a joyous hymn to the resurrection of the spirit to regions  more serene. The willow, covering the spot with floating shadows,  should lend to it its own vague sadness, as it bent and shed about its  soft, wan leaves, as if to protect and to caress my mortal spoils. The  river, too, which in flood tide might almost come and kiss the border  of the slab o'ergrown with reeds, should lull my sleep with pleasant  music. And when some time had passed, and patches of moss had begun to  spread over the stone, a dense growth of wild morning-glories, of  those blue morning-glories with a disk of carmine in the center, which  I loved so much, should grow up by its side, twining through its  crevices and clothing it with their broad transparent leaves, which,  by I know not what mystery, have the form of hearts. Golden insects  with wings of light, whose buzzing lulls to sleep on heated  afternoons, should come and hover round their chalices, and one would  be obliged to draw aside the leafy curtain to read my name, now  blurred by time and moisture. But why should my name be read? Who  would not know that I was sleeping there?\"[1]      [Footnote 1: _Obras de Gustavo A. Becquer_, Madrid, 1898, vol. II,    pp. 242-245. This edition will be understood hereafter in all    references to the works of Becquer.]    So mused the poet Becquer[1] in the golden days of his youth, when his  veins were swelling with health, when his heart was fired with  ambition, and in his ears was ringing the joyous invitation of his  muse.      [Footnote 1: The name is spelled indifferently with or without    accent--_Becquer_ or _Becquer_. In the choice of the latter    spelling, the authority of his principal biographer, Ramon Rodriguez    Correa, has been followed.]    His knowledge of the world was confined to the enchanting city of his  birth. Her gems of art and architecture had wrought themselves into  the fabric of his dreams; he had mused in her palm-gardens, worshiped  in her temples, and dreamed long afternoons on the shores of her  historic river. He knew nothing of the cold, prosaic world of selfish  interests. The time had not yet come when, in bitterness of spirit,  and wrapping his mantle about him against the chill wind of  indifference, he should say: \"To-day my sole ambition is to be a  supernumerary in the vast human comedy, and when my silent role is  ended, to withdraw behind the scenes, neither hissed nor applauded,  making my exit unnoticed.\"[1]      [Footnote 1: _Obras_, vol. II, p. 251.]    Indeed, in those later days of trial and hardship, he would often look  out wearily upon Madrid, the city of his adoption, the scene of his  crushing struggle with necessity, as it lay outspread before his  windows,--\"dirty, black, and ugly as a fleshless skeleton, shivering  under its immense shroud of snow,\"[1] and in his mind he would conjure  up the city of his youth, his ever cherished Seville, \"with her  _Giralda_ of lacework, mirrored in the trembling Guadalquivir, with  her narrow and tortuous Moorish streets, in which one fancies still he  hears the strange cracking sound of the walk of the Justiciary King;  Seville, with her barred windows and her love-songs, her iron  door-screens and her night watchmen, her altar-pieces and her stories,  her brawls and her music, her tranquil nights and her fiery  afternoons, her rosy dawns and her blue twilights; Seville, with all  the traditions that twenty centuries have heaped upon her brow, with  all"]]]
