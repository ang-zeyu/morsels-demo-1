Two households, both alike in dignity,      In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,      From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,      Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.      From forth the fatal loins of these two foes      A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;      Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows      Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.      The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,      And the continuance of their parents' rage,      Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,      Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;      The which if you with patient ears attend,      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.                                                           [Exit.]          ACT I. Scene I.  Verona. A public place.    Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house  of Capulet.        Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.      Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.      Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.      Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.      Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.      Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.      Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.      Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.      Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.      Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take      the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.      Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the      wall.      Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,      are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men      from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.      Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.      Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have      fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off      their heads.      Greg. The heads of the maids?      Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.      Take it in what sense thou wilt.      Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.      Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I      am a pretty piece of flesh.      Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst      been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of      Montagues.               Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].        Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.      Greg. How? turn thy back and run?      Samp. Fear me not.      Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!      Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.      Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.      Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is      disgrace to them, if they bear it.      Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?      Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.      Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?      Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?      Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.      Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my      thumb, sir.      Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?      Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.      Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as      you.      Abr. No better.      Samp. Well, sir.                            Enter Benvolio.        Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my      master's kinsmen.      Samp. Yes, better, sir.      Abr. You lie.      Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.                                                       They fight.      Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]      Put up your swords. You know not what you do.                              Enter Tybalt.        Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?      Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.      Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,      Or manage it to part these men with me.      Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.      Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.         Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or                            partisans.        Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!      Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!               Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.        Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!      Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?      Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come      And flourishes his blade in spite of me.                     Enter Old Montague and his Wife.        Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.      M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.                    Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.        Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,      Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-      Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,      That quench the fire of your pernicious rage      With purple fountains issuing from your veins!      On pain of torture, from those bloody hands      Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground      And hear the sentence of your moved prince.      Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word      By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,      Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets      And made Verona's ancient citizens      Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments      To wield old partisans, in hands as old,      Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.      If ever you disturb our streets again,      Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.      For this time all the rest depart away.      You, Capulet, shall go along with me;      And, Montague, come you this afternoon,      To know our farther pleasure in this case,      To old Freetown, our common judgment place.      Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.                Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].      Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?      Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?      Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary      And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.      I drew to part them. In the instant came      The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;      Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,      He swung about his head and cut the winds,      Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.      While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,      Came more and more, and fought on part and part,      Till the Prince came, who parted either part.      M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?      Right glad I am he was not at this fray.      Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun      Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,      A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;      Where, underneath the grove of sycamore      That westward rooteth from the city's side,      So early walking did I see your son.      Towards him I made; but he was ware of me      And stole into the covert of the wood.      I- measuring his affections by my own,      Which then most sought where most might not be found,      Being one too many by my weary self-      Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,      And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.      Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,      With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,      Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;      But all so soon as the all-cheering sun      Should in the furthest East bean to draw      The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,      Away from light steals home my heavy son      And private in his chamber pens himself,      Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight      And makes himself an artificial night.      Black and portentous must this humour prove      Unless good counsel may the cause remove.      Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?      Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him      Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?      Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;      But he, his own affections' counsellor,      Is to himself- I will not say how true-      But to himself so secret and so close,      So far from sounding and discovery,      As is the bud bit with an envious worm      Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air      Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.      Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,      We would as willingly give cure as know.                           Enter Romeo.        Ben. See, where he comes.

By Wilhelm von Kaulbach      EDITOR'S PREFACE    It is surprising how little the English-speaking world knows of German  literature of the nineteenth century. Goethe and Schiller found their  herald in Carlyle; Fichte's idealistic philosophy helped to mold  Emerson's view of life; Amadeus Hoffmann influenced Poe; Uhland and  Heine reverberate in Longfellow; Sudermann and Hauptmann appear in the  repertory of London and New York theatres--these brief statements  include nearly all the names which to the cultivated Englishman and  American of to-day stand for German literature.    THE GERMAN CLASSICS OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES has been  planned to correct this narrow and inadequate view. Here for the first  time English readers will find a panorama of the whole of German  literature from Goethe to the present day; here for the first time  they will find the most representative writers of each period brought  together and exhibited by their most representative works; here for  the first time an opportunity will be offered to form a just  conception of the truly remarkable literary achievements of Germany  during the last hundred years.    For it is a grave mistake to assume, as has been assumed only too  often, that, after the great epoch of Classicism and Romanticism in  the early decades of the nineteenth century, Germany produced but  little of universal significance, or that, after Goethe and Heine,  there were but few Germans worthy to be mentioned side by side with  the great writers of other European countries. True, there is no  German Tolstoy, no German Ibsen, no German Zola--but then, is there a  Russian Nietzsche, or a Norwegian Wagner, or a French Bismarck? Men  like these, men of revolutionary genius, men who start new movements  and mark new epochs, are necessarily rare and stand isolated in any  people and at all times. The three names mentioned indicate that  Germany, during the last fifty years, has contributed a goodly share  even of such men. Quite apart, however, from such men of overshadowing  genius and all-controlling power, can it be truly said that Germany,  since Goethe's time, has been lacking in writers of high aim and  notable attainment?    It can be stated without reservation that, taken as a whole, the  German drama of the nineteenth century has maintained a level of  excellence superior to that reached by the drama of almost any other  nation during the same period. Schiller's _Wallenstein_ and _Tell_,  Goethe's _Iphigenie_ and _Faust_, Kleist's _Prinz Friedrich von  Homburg_, Grillparzer's _Medea_, Hebbel's _Maria Magdalene_ and _Die  Nibelungen_, Otto Ludwig's _Der Erbfoerster_, Freytag's _Die  Journalisten_, Anzengruber's _Der Meineidbauer_, Wilbrandt's _Der  Meister von Palmyra_, Wildenbruch's _Konig Heinrich_, Sudermann's  _Heimat_, Hauptmann's _Die Weber_ and _Der arme Heinrich_,  Hofmannsthal's _Elektra_, and, in addition to all these, the great  musical dramas of Richard Wagner--this is a century's record of  dramatic achievement of which any nation might be proud. I doubt  whether either the French or the Russian or the Scandinavian stage of  the nineteenth century, as a whole, comes up to this standard.  Certainly, the English stage has nothing which could in any way be  compared with it.    That German lyric verse of the last hundred years should have been  distinguished by beauty of structure, depth of feeling, and wealth of  melody, is not to be wondered at if we remember that this was the  century of the revival of folk-song, and that it produced such  song-composers as Schubert and Schumann and Robert Franz and Hugo Wolf  and Richard Strauss. But it seems strange that, apart from Heine, even  the greatest of German lyric poets, such as Platen, Lenau, Moerike,  Annette von Droste, Geibel, Liliencron, Dehmel, Muenchhausen, Rilke,  should be so little known beyond the borders of the Fatherland.    The German novel of the past century was, for a long time,  unquestionably inferior to both the English and the French novel of  the same epoch. But in the midst of much that is tiresome and involved  and artificial, there stand out, even in the middle of the century,  such masterpieces of characterization as Otto Ludwig's _Zwischen  Himmel und Erde_ or Wilhelm Raabe's _Der Hungerpastor_, such  delightful revelations of genuine humor as Fritz Reuter's _Ut mine  Stromtid_, such penetrating studies of social conditions as Gustav  Freytag's _Soll und Haben_. And during the last third of the century  there has clearly developed a new, forcible, original style of German  novel writing. Seldom has the short story been handled more skilfully  and felicitously than by such men as Paul Heyse, Gottfried Keller, C.  F. Meyer, Theodor Storm. Seldom has the novel of tragic import and  passion been treated with greater refinement and delicacy than in such  works as Fontane's _Effi Briest_, Ricarda Huch's _Ludolf Ursleu_,  Wilhelm von Polenz's _Der Buettnerbauer_, or Ludwig Thoma's _Andreas  Voest_. And it may be doubted whether, at the present moment, there is  any country where the novel is represented by so many gifted writers  or exhibits such exuberant vitality, such sturdy truthfulness, such  seriousness of purpose, or such a wide range of imagination as in  contemporary Germany.    All these dramatists, lyric poets, and novelists, and with them not a  few essayists, philosophers, orators, and publicists,[1] of the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries will speak in the following volumes  to America and other countries of the English language. They have been  arranged, in the main, chronologically. The first three volumes have  been given to the mature work of Goethe and Schiller--time-tested and  securely niched. Volumes IV and V contain the principal Romanticists,  including Fichte and Schelling; Volume VI brings Heine, Grillparzer,  and Beethoven to view;    Volume VII, Hegel and Young Germany; Volume VIII, Auerbach, Gotthelf,  and Fritz Reuter; Volume IX, Hebbel and Ludwig; Volume X, Bismarck,  Moltke, Lassalle.
