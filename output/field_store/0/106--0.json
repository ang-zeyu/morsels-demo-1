New York        STRUWWELPETER      Merry Stories and  Funny Pictures          When the children have been good,      That is, be it understood,      Good at meal-times, good at play,      Good all night and good all day--      They shall have the pretty things      Merry Christmas always brings.        Naughty, romping girls and boys      Tear their clothes and make a noise,      Spoil their pinafores and frocks,      And deserve no Christmas-box.      Such as these shall never look      At this pretty Picture-book.          Shock-headed Peter          Just look at him! there he stands,      With his nasty hair and hands.      See! his nails are never cut;      They are grimed as black as soot;      And the sloven, I declare,      Never once has combed his hair;      Anything to me is sweeter      Than to see Shock-headed Peter.          Cruel Frederick          Here is cruel Frederick, see!      A horrid wicked boy was he;      He caught the flies, poor little things,      And then tore off their tiny wings,      He killed the birds, and broke the chairs,      And threw the kitten down the stairs;      And oh! far worse than all beside,      He whipped his Mary, till she cried.        The trough was full, and faithful Tray      Came out to drink one sultry day;      He wagged his tail, and wet his lip,      When cruel Fred snatched up a whip,      And whipped poor Tray till he was sore,      And kicked and whipped him more and more:      At this, good Tray grew very red,      And growled, and bit him till he bled;      Then you should only have been by,      To see how Fred did scream and cry!        So Frederick had to go to bed:      His leg was very sore and red!      The Doctor came, and shook his head,      And made a very great to-do,      And gave him nasty physic too.        But good dog Tray is happy now;      He has no time to say \"Bow-wow!\"      He seats himself in Frederick's chair      And laughs to see the nice things there:      The soup he swallows, sup by sup--      And eats the pies and puddings up.          The Dreadful Story of Harriet and the Matches          It almost makes me cry to tell      What foolish Harriet befell.      Mamma and Nurse went out one day      And left her all alone at play.      Now, on the table close at hand,      A box of matches chanced to stand;      And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,      That, if she touched them, they would scold her.      But Harriet said: \"Oh, what a pity!      For, when they burn, it is so pretty;      They crackle so, and spit, and flame:      Mamma, too, often does the same.\"        The pussy-cats heard this,      And they began to hiss,      And stretch their claws,      And raise their paws;      \"Me-ow,\" they said, \"me-ow, me-o,      You'll burn to death, if you do so.\"        But Harriet would not take advice:      She lit a match, it was so nice!      It crackled so, it burned so clear--      Exactly like the picture here.      She jumped for joy and ran about      And was too pleased to put it out.        The Pussy-cats saw this      And said: \"Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!\"      And stretched their claws,      And raised their paws:      \"'Tis very, very wrong, you know,      Me-ow, me-o, me-ow, me-o,      You will be burnt, if you do so.\"        And see! oh, what dreadful thing!      The fire has caught her apron-string;      Her apron burns, her arms, her hair--      She burns all over everywhere.        Then how the pussy-cats did mew--      What else, poor pussies, could they do?      They screamed for help, 'twas all in vain!      So then they said: \"We'll scream again;      Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o,      She'll burn to death; we told her so.\"        So she was burnt, with all her clothes,      And arms, and hands, and eyes, and nose;      Till she had nothing more to lose      Except her little scarlet shoes;      And nothing else but these was found      Among her ashes on the ground.        And when the good cats sat beside      The smoking ashes, how they cried!      \"Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo,      What will Mamma and Nursey do?\"      Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast,      They made a little pond at last.          The Story of the Inky Boys          As he had often done before,      The woolly-headed Black-a-moor      One nice fine summer's day went out      To see the shops, and walk about;      And, as he found it hot, poor fellow,      He took with him his green umbrella,      Then Edward, little noisy wag,      Ran out and laughed, and waved his flag;      And William came in jacket trim,      And brought his wooden hoop with him;      And Arthur, too, snatched up his toys      And joined the other naughty boys.      So, one and all set up a roar,      And laughed and hooted more and more,      And kept on singing,--only think!--      \"Oh, Blacky, you're as black as ink!\"        Now tall Agrippa lived close by--      So tall, he almost touched the sky;      He had a mighty inkstand, too,      In which a great goose-feather grew;      He called out in an angry tone      \"Boys, leave the Black-a-moor alone!      For, if he tries with all his might,      He cannot change from black to white.\"      But, ah! they did not mind a bit      What great Agrippa said of it;      But went on laughing, as before,      And hooting at the Black-a-moor.        Then great Agrippa foams with rage--      Look at him on this very page!      He seizes Arthur, seizes Ned,      Takes William by his little head;        And they may scream and kick and call,      Into the ink he dips them all;      Into the inkstand, one, two, three,      Till they are black as black can be;      Turn over now, and you shall see.        See, there they are, and there they run!      The Black-a-moor enjoys the fun.      They have been made as black as crows,      Quite black all over, eyes and nose,      And legs, and arms, and heads, and toes,      And trousers, pinafores, and toys--      The silly little inky boys!      Because they set up such a roar,      And teased the harmless Black-a-moor.          The Story of the Man that went out Shooting          This is the man that shoots the hares;      This is the coat he always wears:      With game-bag, powder-horn, and gun      He's going out to have some fun.        He finds it hard, without a pair      Of spectacles, to shoot the hare.      The hare sits snug in leaves and grass,      And laughs to see the green man pass.        Now, as the sun grew very hot,      And he a heavy gun had got,      He lay down underneath a tree      And went to sleep, as you may see.      And, while he slept like any top,      The little hare came, hop, hop, hop,      Took gun and spectacles, and then      On her hind legs went off again.        The green man wakes and sees her place      The spectacles upon her face;      And now she's trying all she can      To shoot the sleepy, green-coat man.      He cries and screams and runs away;      The hare runs after him all day      And hears him call out everywhere:      \"Help! Fire! Help! The Hare! The Hare!\"        At last he stumbled at the well,      Head over ears, and in he fell.      The hare stopped short, took aim and, hark!      Bang went the gun--she missed her mark!        The poor man's wife was drinking up      Her coffee in her coffee-cup;      The gun shot cup and saucer through;      \"Oh dear!\" cried she; \"what shall I do?\"      There lived close by the cottage there      The hare's own child, the little hare;      And while she stood upon her toes,      The coffee fell and burned her nose.      \"Oh dear!\" she cried, with spoon in hand,      \"Such fun I do not understand.\"          The Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb          One day Mamma said \"Conrad dear,      I must go out and leave you here.      But mind now, Conrad, what I say,      Don't suck your thumb while I'm away.      The great tall tailor always comes      To little boys who suck their thumbs;      And ere they dream what he's about,      He takes his great sharp scissors out,      And cuts their thumbs clean off--and then,      You know, they never grow again.\"        Mamma had scarcely turned her back,      The thumb was in, Alack! Alack!        The door flew open, in he ran,      The great, long, red-legged scissor-man.      Oh! children, see! the tailor's come      And caught out little Suck-a-Thumb.      Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go;      And Conrad cries out \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\"      Snip! Snap! Snip! They go so fast,      That both his thumbs are off at last.        Mamma comes home: there Conrad stands,      And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;      \"Ah!\" said Mamma, \"I knew he'd come      To naughty little Suck-a-Thumb.\"          The Story of Augustus  who would not have any Soup          Augustus was a chubby lad;      Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had:      And everybody saw with joy      The plump and hearty, healthy boy.      He ate and drank as he was told,      And never let his soup get cold.      But one day, one cold winter's day,      He screamed out \"Take the soup away!      O take the nasty soup away!      I won't have any soup today.\"        Next day, now look, the picture shows      How lank and lean Augustus grows!      Yet, though he feels so weak and ill,      The naughty fellow cries out still      \"Not any soup for me, I say:      O take the nasty soup away!      I _won't_ have any soup today.\"        The third day comes: Oh what a sin!      To make himself so pale and thin.      Yet, when the soup is put on table,      He screams, as loud as he is able,      \"Not any soup for me, I say:      O take the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12122"],[0,"The Monkey's Paw (#1)"],[1,"LADY OF THE BARGE    AND OTHER STORIES    By W. W. Jacobs          THE MONKEY'S PAW      I.    Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnam  Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly.  Father and son  were at chess, the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving  radical changes, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils  that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting  placidly by the fire.    \"Hark at the wind,\" said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake  after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from  seeing it.    \"I'm listening,\" said the latter, grimly surveying the board as he  stretched out his hand.  \"Check.\"    \"I should hardly think that he'd come to-night,\" said his father, with  his hand poised over the board.    \"Mate,\" replied the son.    \"That's the worst of living so far out,\" bawled Mr. White, with sudden  and unlooked-for violence; \"of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way  places to live in, this is the worst.  Pathway's a bog, and the road's a  torrent.  I don't know what people are thinking about.  I suppose because  only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter.\"    \"Never mind, dear,\" said his wife, soothingly; \"perhaps you'll win the  next one.\"    Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance  between mother and son.  The words died away on his lips, and he hid a  guilty grin in his thin grey beard.    \"There he is,\" said Herbert White, as the gate banged to loudly and heavy  footsteps came toward the door.    The old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard  condoling with the new arrival.  The new arrival also condoled with  himself, so that Mrs. White said, \"Tut, tut!\"  and coughed gently as her  husband entered the room, followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and  rubicund of visage.    \"Sergeant-Major Morris,\" he said, introducing him.    The sergeant-major shook hands, and taking the proffered seat by the  fire, watched contentedly while his host got out whiskey and tumblers and  stood a small copper kettle on the fire.    At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the  little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from  distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke  of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange  peoples.    \"Twenty-one years of it,\" said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son.  \"When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse.  Now look  at him.\"    \"He don't look to have taken much harm,\" said Mrs. White, politely.    \"I'd like to go to India myself,\" said the old man, \"just to look round a  bit, you know.\"    \"Better where you are,\" said the sergeant-major, shaking his head.  He  put down the empty glass, and sighing softly, shook it again.    \"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,\" said  the old man.  \"What was that you started telling me the other day about a  monkey's paw or something, Morris?\"    \"Nothing,\" said the soldier, hastily.  \"Leastways nothing worth hearing.\"    \"Monkey's paw?\"  said Mrs. White, curiously.    \"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps,\" said the  sergeant-major, offhandedly.    His three listeners leaned forward eagerly.  The visitor absent-mindedly  put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again.  His host  filled it for him.    \"To look at,\" said the sergeant-major, fumbling in his pocket, \"it's just  an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.\"    He took something out of his pocket and proffered it.  Mrs. White drew  back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.    \"And what is there special about it?\"  inquired Mr. White as he took it  from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.    \"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir,\" said the sergeant-major,  \"a very holy man.  He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and  that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow.  He put a spell  on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.\"    His manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their  light laughter jarred somewhat.    \"Well, why don't you have three, sir?\"  said Herbert White, cleverly.    The soldier regarded him in the way that middle age is wont to regard  presumptuous youth.  \"I have,\" he said, quietly, and his blotchy face  whitened.    \"And did you really have the three wishes granted?\"  asked Mrs. White.    \"I did,\" said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong  teeth.    \"And has anybody else wished?\"  persisted the old lady.    \"The first man had his three wishes.  Yes,\" was the reply; \"I don't know  what the first two were, but the third was for death.  That's how I got  the paw.\"    His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.    \"If you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now, then, Morris,\"  said the old man at last.  \"What do you keep it for?\"    The soldier shook his head.  \"Fancy, I suppose,\" he said, slowly.  \"I did  have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will.  It has caused  enough mischief already.  Besides, people won't buy.  They think it's a  fairy tale; some of them, and those who do think anything of it want to  try it first and pay me afterward.\"    \"If you could have another three wishes,\" said the old man, eyeing him  keenly, \"would you have them?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the other.  \"I don't know.\"    He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb,  suddenly threw it upon the fire.  White, with a slight cry, stooped down  and snatched it off.    \"Better let it burn,\" said the soldier, solemnly.    \"If you don't want it, Morris,\" said the other, \"give it to me.\"    \"I won't,\" said his friend, doggedly.  \"I threw it on the fire.  If you  keep it, don't blame me for what happens.  Pitch it on the fire again  like a sensible man.\"    The other shook his head and examined his new possession closely.  \"How  do you do it?\"  he inquired.    \"Hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud,\" said the sergeant-major,  \"but I warn you of the consequences.\"    \"Sounds like the Arabian Nights,\" said Mrs. White, as she rose and began  to set the supper.  \"Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of  hands for me?\"    Her husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into  laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught  him by the arm.    \"If you must wish,\" he said, gruffly, \"wish for something sensible.\"    Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his  friend to the table.  In the business of supper the talisman was partly  forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion  to a second instalment of the soldier's adventures in India.    \"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he  has been telling us,\" said Herbert, as the door closed behind their  guest, just in time for him to catch the last train, \"we sha'nt make much  out of it.\"    \"Did you give him anything for it, father?\"  inquired Mrs. White,  regarding her husband closely.    \"A trifle,\" said he, colouring slightly.  \"He didn't want it, but I made  him take it.  And he pressed me again to throw it away.\"    \"Likely,\" said Herbert, with pretended horror.  \"Why, we're going to be  rich, and famous and happy.  Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin  with; then you can't be henpecked.\"    He darted round the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs. White armed with  an antimacassar.    Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously.  \"I don't  know what to wish for, and that's a fact,\" he said, slowly.  \"It seems to  me I've got all I want.\"    \"If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you?\"  said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder.  \"Well, wish for two hundred  pounds, then; that 'll just do it.\"    His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the  talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at  his mother, sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords.    \"I wish for two hundred pounds,\" said the old man distinctly.    A fine crash from the piano greeted the words, interrupted by a  shuddering cry from the old man.  His wife and son ran toward him.    \"It moved,\" he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on  the floor.    \"As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.\"    \"Well, I don't see the money,\" said his son as he picked it up and placed  it on the table, \"and I bet I never shall.\"    \"It must have been your fancy, father,\" said his wife, regarding him  anxiously.    He shook his head.  \"Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it  gave me a shock all the same.\"    They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes.  Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously  at the sound of a door banging upstairs.  A silence unusual and  depressing settled upon all three, which lasted until the old couple rose  to retire for the night.    \"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your  bed,\" said Herbert, as he bade them good-night, \"and something horrible  squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your  ill-gotten gains.\"    He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces  in it.  The last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it  in amazement.  It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt  on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it.  His  hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand  on his coat and went up to bed.        II.
