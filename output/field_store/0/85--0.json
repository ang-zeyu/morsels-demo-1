THE NEW GERMAN DISPATCH BOAT METEOR.      In time of war the dispatch boats are the eyes of the fleet. It is their  duty to reconnoiter and ascertain the strength of the enemy and to carry  the orders of the commander. For this service great speed is of the  utmost importance. As all nations have increased the speed of their war  ships during the last few years, it has become necessary to build faster  dispatch boats. Although our new vessels of this class, Blitz, Pfeil,  Greif, Jagd, and Wacht, fulfill the requirements, still greater speed  was deemed requisite, and steps were taken for the construction of the  Meteor, which was launched at Kiel in 1890. This vessel is 262 ft. long,  31 ft. wide, and has a draught of 13 ft., and a displacement of 950  tons. There are two independent engines, each of which develops 2,500  h.p., making a total of 5,000 h.p.; and each engine drives a screw. When  both engines are running with their full power, the Meteor has a speed  of 24 knots (over 271/2 miles) an hour, which is equal to the speed of a  freight train.[1] As the resistance of the water increases greatly with  an increase in the speed of the vessel, the engines of the Meteor are  very large in comparison with the size of the vessel. The largest  armored vessel in the navy, the Konig Wilhelm, for example, has a  displacement of 9,557 tons, and its engines develop 8,000 h.p., driving  the vessel at a rate of 14 knots an hour; that is, 0.84 h.p. to each ton  of displacement, while in the Meteor there is 5.26 h.p. to each ton of  displacement. The Meteor has a crew of 90 men, and an armament of eight  light guns, and has no rigging; only one mast for signaling. Steam power  is used for raising the anchor, removing the ashes from the engine room,  and for distilling water. The vessel is lighted with electricity, and is  also provided with electrical apparatus for search lights.--_Illustrirte  Zeitung_.    [Footnote 1: This, we believe, is the fastest vessel of the kind  afloat.--ED. S.A.]    [Illustration: THE NEW GERMAN DISPATCH BOAT METEOR.]           *       *       *       *       *          THE RAISING OF THE ULUNDA.      Shortly after the recovery of the Ulunda, below described, the North  American and West Indian squadron of the Royal Navy visited Halifax,  Nova Scotia. The simple and novel means adopted for raising the ship  attracted considerable attention among the officers of the fleet, and by  way of stimulating the studies of the junior officers in this branch of  their duties, a prize was offered for the best essay on the subject, to  be competed for by the midshipmen of the various ships. The essays were  adjudicated upon by Captain W.G. Stopford, of the flag ship--H.M.S.  Bellerophon--and the first prize was awarded to the following paper,  written by Mr. A. Gordon Smith, of H.M.S. Canada. The article needs no  apology, but it is only just, says the _Engineer_, to mention the fact  that the writer is not yet eighteen years of age.    The steamship Ulunda, on the remarkable raising and recovery of which  this paper is written, is an iron screw ship of 1,161 tons, until lately  belonging to the Furness line. It is a sister ship to the Damara, of the  same company, and was built and engined by Alex. Stephens, shipbuilder  and engineer, at Glasgow, being fitted with compound vertical engines,  of 200 nominal horse power, having two cylinders of 33 inches and 66  inches diameter respectively, which are capable of sixty-five  revolutions per minute, and give a speed of twelve knots an hour.    For supplying steam to the engines there are two return-tube boilers,  each having three furnaces, and there is also a donkey boiler, which is  used in harbor for working the four steam winches on deck.    She is divided into seven watertight compartments by athwartship  bulkheads. The foremost one is the usual collision bulkhead. Between  this and the foremost engine room bulkhead are Nos. 1 and 2 holds,  separated by a watertight bulkhead. Abaft the after engine room are two  more holds, divided in the same manner as the forward ones, and astern  is another compartment, in which all stores are kept. Coal bunkers form  a protection for the engines and boilers. Fore and aft the ship, as low  down as possible, are a number of ballast tanks, which can be filled  with or emptied of water as occasion requires to alter the trim of the  ship. Extending over all holds there is a strong iron lower deck, about  8 feet below the upper deck, which is pierced with a hatch over each  hold immediately under a corresponding hatch in the upper deck, for  stowing and unstowing cargo.    [Illustration]    In the engine room there are six steam pumps, two of them bilge pumps,  worked by the main crossheads, for clearing the engine room of water.  For pumping out the ballast tanks there are two more, which have their  own independent engines. The remaining two are for various purposes.  Besides these there are several hand pumps on the upper deck.    Having been built in 1885, the Ulunda is almost a new ship, and has been  used principally as a cargo steamer, though she is provided also with a  saloon and staterooms for a few passengers. She was on her way from St.  John, New Brunswick, to Halifax, when during a thick fog she struck on  Cowl Ledge, a reef between Bryer and Long Islands, on the southwest  coast of Nova Scotia, about half a mile from the shore. The cause of the  disaster was probably one of the strong tide eddies which exist in the  Bay of Fundy, and which had set her in toward the shore. It was calm at  the time, and she was making seven knots an hour; and, being close to  the shore, leads should have been going in the chains. Had this  precaution been taken, very probably she would have been able to stop or  anchor in time to avert this catastrophe. There was no cargo on board,  it being intended to ship one at Halifax for London.    When ashore on this reef she was sold by public auction at Halifax, and  fell to a syndicate of private individuals for L440. These gentlemen at  once decided to raise her if possible, transport her into dock, and  repair her. They commissioned Captain Kelly, of the Princess Beatrice, a  ship then in harbor, to visit her and see what could be done for that  purpose. He went with a hired crew to Annapolis, and from thence  proceeded to the steamer by means of a tug, a distance of about forty  miles. When they arrived they found the Ulunda with her head to sea, and  her stern in only 2 ft. of water at low tide, with a list of 30 deg. to  port and her foremast broken short off. At high tide the water flowed  over the upper deck. On examination, the engine room was found full of  water, which did not rise and fall with the tide, showing that it had  been filled at high tide through its skylight. No. 3 hold was also full,  but had a slight leak, which was shown by the water falling slowly at  low tide and rising in the same manner at high water. The other three  holds were hopelessly leaky.    Upon investigation, it was decided to pump out the engine room  compartment and No. 3 hold, and to make the iron lower deck watertight  over the remaining holds. For this purpose three powerful pumps, with  the necessary boilers, were obtained from Halifax, sent by rail to  Annapolis, and then shipped on board a tug, from which they were hoisted  into the Ulunda by means of the derricks on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11662"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 598, June 18, 1887 (#1)"],[1,"Team            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 598          NEW YORK, JUNE 18, 1887    Scientific American Supplement.

The Havre Maritime Exhibition opened on the 7th of May.    Will this exhibition awaken general interest, or will it prove a local  affair simply? This is a secret of the weeks that are to follow.    Should nothing chance to discourage the general interest that surrounds  Havre, to dampen the enthusiasm of the public, or to act to the prejudice  of the exhibitors, whose very evident desire is to show nothing but  remarkable products in every line, the International Maritime Exhibition  will prove a great success.    [Illustration: THE INTERNATIONAL MARINE EXHIBITION AT HAVRE.--THE  PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE.]    The people of Havre have two points of comparison that more particularly  concern themselves: Their Maritime Exhibition of 1868, which, as far as  exhibition goes, was a complete success, is the first. The financial  results of it were not brilliant, but that was due to certain reasons upon  which it is not necessary to dwell. On the contrary, the Rouen Exhibition  of 1884 proved profitable.    The Havre Exhibition, under able management, can have only a like good  fortune. It must be said that the people of Havre would be deeply  humiliated should it prove otherwise.    A very appropriate location was selected for the Exhibition, in the busiest  quarter of the center of the city. Its circumference embraces one of the  finest docks of the port--the Commerce Dock, thus named because it could  not be finished (in 1827) except by the financial co-operation of the  shipowners and merchants of the city. For the purposes of the Exhibition,  this dock is now temporarily closed to navigation.    In the various structures, wood has been exclusively employed. The main  building, which alone has a monumental character, is Arabic in style, and  is situated in the center of Gambetta Place, over Paris Street, which here  becomes a tunnel. Two facades overlook the ends of this tunnel. A third  facade, which is much longer, fronts Commerce Dock.    The edifice is surmounted by a spherical cupola that serves as a base to a  semaphore provided with masts and rigging. On each side of the sphere there  are two pendent beacons. Wide glazed bays open in the external facades, and  allow the eye to wander to the south through Paris Street as far as to the  outer port, to the summits of Floride, and to see beyond this point the bay  of La Seine, Honfleur, and the coast of Grace. To the north, the most  limited view has for perspective the City Hall, its garden, and the  charming coast of Ingonville.    The principal facade, that which fronts Commerce Dock, from which it is  separated solely by a garden laid out on Mature Place, is the most  attractive and most ornamented. Here are located the restaurants, the  cafes, the music pavilion, and a few other light structures.    Internally, this portion of the Exhibition comprises a vast entertainment  hall, brilliantly and artistically decorated with tympans representing the  three principal ports of commerce--Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles--and  with pictures by the best marine painters. It is lighted by an immense  stained glass window which fronts Commerce Dock and the garden, and which  lets in a flood of soft light.    The galleries to the right and left, over Paris Street, are reserved for  the exhibitions of the ministers of state and of the large public  departments, and for models, specimens, plans, and drawings of war and  merchant vessels, and of pleasure boats, and for plans of port, roadstead,  and river works.    Two endless galleries run to the north and south of Commerce Dock, parallel  with Orleans Wharf on the one hand and Lamblardie Wharf on the other.    The northern gallery is connected by a foot bridge with the annex of  Commerce Place, where is located the colonial exhibition, the center of  which is occupied by a Cambodian pavilion, in which are brought together  the products of Indo-China and Algeria. For half of their extent, the two  galleries are separated from the dock by a promenade provided with seats  and covered with a roof. On this promenade, it became necessary to make  room for certain belated exhibitors whose products are not affected by the  open air.    In Commerce Dock are to be seen, floating, specimens of every ancient and  modern naval construction, French and foreign, among which are the state  convette Favorite and an English three-master converted into a cafe boat.  We find here, too, the giant and prehistoric oak of the Rhine, on board of  the Drysphore.    Commerce Dock is divided into two parts by a foot bridge, which allows the  visitors to pass from one side to the other without being compelled to  tiresomely retrace their steps.    The main entrance to the Exhibition is opposite the portico of the theater,  on Gambetta Place. A second entrance is found on Commerce Place in the  colonies annex. The others, near the center, are on Orleans Wharf, opposite  Edward Larue Street, and on Lamblardie Wharf, opposite Hospital Street and  opposite Saint Louis Street.    The garden of the Exhibition and the galleries that surround it are  illuminated at night by the electric light.--_L'Illustration._           *       *       *       *       *          OUR COAST DEFENSES.      General H.L. Abbott delivered a lecture before the Academy of Sciences in  New York, on the evening of March 21, a summary of which is given by the  _Herald_ as follows:    According to General Abbott, the country needs for its coast defenses:        Heavy guns;      Armor-clad casemates;      Disappearing gun carriages in earthworks;      Heavy mortars;      Submarine mines or fixed torpedoes; and      Fish torpedoes.    The lecturer said that this nation may be attacked in four ways: First, by  fleet and army combined, as in our revolutionary war; second, by blockading  the entrances to all our ports; third, by bombardment of our seaport cities  from a long distance; fourth, by a fleet forcing its way into our harbors,  and making a direct attack or levying tribute on our people.    The first is not now greatly to be feared. We are too distant from great  powers, and too strong on land.    The second should be met by the navy, and is, therefore, outside a  discussion of coast defenses.    The third is not probable, though it may be possible. The extreme range of  10 miles for heavy guns cannot be obtained from shipboard, and as an  elevation of only 15 deg. or 16 deg. can be given, not over 5 to 6 miles range is  attainable.    The fourth is the one which is possible, probable, even certain--if we have  war before we have better defenses.    The race between guns and armor began about thirty years ago, and there has  been more development in ships and guns in that time than in"]]]
