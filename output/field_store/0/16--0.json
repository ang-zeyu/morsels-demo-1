VOL. 12, No. 326.] SATURDAY, AUGUST 9, 1828. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *            [Illustration]        REGENT BRIDGE, EDINBURGH.      Edinburgh, \"the Queen of the North,\" abounds in splendid specimens of  classical architecture. Since the year 1769, when the building of the  New Town commenced, its improvement has been prosecuted with  extraordinary zeal; consequently, the city has not only been extended on  all sides, but has received the addition of some magnificent public  edifices, while the access to it from every quarter has been greatly  facilitated and embellished. Of the last-mentioned improvement our  engraving is a mere vignette, but it deserves to rank among the most  superb of those additions.    The inconvenience of the access to Edinburgh by the great London road  was long a subject of general regret. In entering the city from this  quarter, the road lay through narrow and inconvenient streets, forming  an approach no way suited to the general elegance of the place. In 1814,  however, a magnificent entrance was commenced across the Calton Hill,  between which and Prince's street a deep ravine intervened, which was  formerly occupied with old and ill-built streets. In order to connect  the hill with Prince's-street, all these have been swept away, and an  elegant arch, called _Regent Bridge_, has been thrown over the hollow,  which makes the descent from the hill into this street easy and  agreeable. Thus, in place of being carried, as formerly, through long  and narrow streets, the great road from the east into Edinburgh sweeps  along the side of the steep and singular elevation of the Calton Hill;  whence the traveller has first a view of the Old Town, with its elevated  buildings crowning the summit of the adjacent ridges, and rising upon  the eye in imposing masses; and, afterwards, of the New Town finely  contrasted with the Old, in the regularity and elegance of its general  outline.    _Regent Bridge_ was begun in 1816, and finished in 1819. The arch is  semicircular, and fifty feet wide. At the north front it is forty-five  feet in height, and at the south front sixty-four feet two inches, the  difference being occasioned by the ground declining to the south. The  roadway is formed by a number of reverse arches on each side. The great  arch is ornamented on the south and north by two open arches, supported  by elegant columns of the Corinthian order. The whole property purchased  to open the communication to the city by this bridge cost 52,000l, and  the building areas sold for the immense sum of 35,000l. The street along  the bridge is called Waterloo-place, as it was founded in the year on  which that memorable battle was fought.    The engraving[1] is an interesting picture of classic beauty; and as the  \"approaches\" and proposed \"dry arches\" to the New London Bridge are now  becoming matters of speculative interest, we hope this entrance to our  metropolis will ultimately present a similar display of architectural  elegance. LONDON, with all her opulence, ought not to yield in  comparison with any city in the world; and it is high time that the  march of taste be quickened in this quarter.

Weep, for the word is spoken--      Mourn, for the knell hath knoll'd--    The master chord is broken,      And the master's hand is cold!    Romance hath lost her minstrel,      No more his magic strain    Shall throw a sweeter spell around,      The legends of Almaine.      His fame had flown before him      To many a foreign land,    His lays are sung by every tongue,      And harp'd by every hand!    He came to cull fresh laurels,      But fate was in their breath,    And turn'd his march of triumph      Into a dirge of death.      O! all who knew him lov'd him,      For with his mighty mind,    He bore himself so meekly,      His heart it was so kind!    His wildly warbling melodies,      The storms that round them roll,    Are types of the simplicity      And grandeur of his soul.      Though years of ceaseless suffering      Had worn him to a shade,    So patient was his spirit,      No wayward plaint he made.    E'en death itself seem'd loath to scare      His victim pure and mild;    And stole upon him quietly      As slumber o'er a child.      Weep, for the word is spoken--      Mourn, for the knell hath knoll'd--    The master chord is broken,      And the master's hand is cold!    The master chord is broken,      And the master's hand is cold!    PLANCHE.           *       *       *       *       *      YOUNG NAPOLEON.    _(For the Mirror.)_      It is impossible at this time of day, to foretell how the future  destinies of Europe may be influenced by the subject of these lines. To  use the words of the talented author of the _Improvisatrice_, \"Poetry  needs no preface.\" However in this instance, a few remarks may not be  uninteresting. Until I met with the following stanzas, I was not aware  that Napoleon had been a votary of the muses. He has certainly climbed  the Parnassian mount with considerable success, whether we take the  interest of the subject, or the correctness of the versification into  consideration. Memorials like these of such a man, are, in the highest  degree, interesting; they serve to display the _man_, divested of the  \"pomp and circumstance\" of royalty. That Napoleon had many faults cannot  be disputed, but it is equally clear that he possessed many virtues the  world never gave him credit for:--_\"Posterity will do me justice.\"_    I subjoin two translations of the beautiful lines written by Napoleon at  St. Helena, on the portrait of his son. The love he bore to his son was  carried to enthusiasm. According to those persons who had access to his  society at St. Helena, his young heir was the continual object of his  solicitude during the period of seven years, \"_For him alone,_\" he said,  \"_I returned from the Island of Elba, and if I still form some  expectations on earth, they are also for him._\" He has declared to  several of his suite, that he every day suffered the greatest anxiety on  his account. Since I met with these lines however, I have found that  Napoleon had in his youth composed a poem on Corsica, some extracts of  which are to be found in \"Les Annales de l'Europe\" a German collection.  He was exceedingly anxious in after life to destroy the copies of this  poem which had been circulated, and bought and procured them by every  means in his power for the purpose of destroying them; it is probable  not a single copy is in existence at the present period. It has been  remarked, that, \"it requires nothing short of the solitude of exile, and  the idolatry which he manifested for his son, to inspire him once more.  In neither of the original poems is it indicated which he preferred.\"    VYVYAN.      TO THE PORTRAIT OF MY SON.        Delightful image of my much loved boy!      Behold his eyes, his looks, his cherub smile!    No more, alas! will he enkindle joy,      Nor on some kindlier shore my woes beguile.      My son! my darling son! wert thou but here,      My bosom should receive thy lovely form:    Thou'dst soothe my gloomy hours with converse dear:      Serenely mild behold the lowering storm.      I'd be the partner of thy infant cares,      And pour instruction o'er thy expanding mind;    Whilst in thy heart, in my declining years,      My wearied soul should an asylum find.      My wrongs--my cares--should be forgot with thee,      My power--imperial dignities--renown--    This rock itself would be a heaven to me;      Thine arms more cherished than the victor's crown.      O! in thine arms, my son! I could forget that fame      Shall give me, through all time, a never dying name.    (Signed.) NAPOLEON.      Another version is subjoined of lines, \"To the Portrait of My Son.\"        O! Cherished image of my infant heir!      Thy surface does his lineaments impart:--    But ah! thou liv'st not. On this rock so bare      His living form shall never glad my heart.      My second-self! how would'st thy presence cheer      The settled sadness of thy hapless sire!    Thine infancy with tenderness I'd rear,      And thou should'st warm my age with youthful fire.      In thee, a truly glorious crown I'd find;      With thee, upon this rock a heaven should own:    Thy kiss would chase past conquests from my mind,    Which raised me demi-god on Gallia's throne.

I cannot at present turn to the passage in Cicero, but  Bentley's quotation may surely be accepted as evidence of the existence  of the passage.    _Twickenham._ H.

BY JOHN LORD, LL.D.,    AUTHOR OF \"THE OLD ROMAN WORLD,\" \"MODERN EUROPE,\"  ETC., ETC.                To the Memory of    MARY PORTER LORD,    WHOSE FRIENDSHIP AND APPRECIATION    AS A DEVOTED WIFE    ENCOURAGED ME TO A LONG LIFE    OF HISTORICAL LABORS,    This Work    IS GRATEFULLY AND AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED    BY THE AUTHOR.          PUBLISHERS' NOTE.      In preparing a new edition of Dr. Lord's great work, the \"Beacon Lights  of History,\" it has been necessary to make some rearrangement of  lectures and volumes. Dr. Lord began with his volume on classic  \"Antiquity,\" and not until he had completed five volumes did he return  to the remoter times of \"Old Pagan Civilizations\" (reaching back to  Assyria and Egypt) and the \"Jewish Heroes and Prophets.\" These issued,  he took up again the line of great men and movements, and brought it  down to modern days.    The \"Old Pagan Civilizations,\" of course, stretch thousands of years  before the Hebrews, and the volume so entitled would naturally be the  first. Then follows the volume on \"Jewish Heroes and Prophets,\" ending  with St. Paul and the Christian Era. After this volume, which in any  position, dealing with the unique race of the Jews, must stand by  itself, we return to the brilliant picture of the Pagan centuries, in  \"Ancient Achievements\" and \"Imperial Antiquity,\" the latter coming down  to the Fall of Rome in the fourth century A.D., which ends the era of  \"Antiquity\" and begins the \"Middle Ages.\"    NEW YORK, September 15, 1902.          AUTHOR'S PREFACE.      It has been my object in these Lectures to give the substance of  accepted knowledge pertaining to the leading events and characters of  history; and in treating such a variety of subjects, extending over a  period of more than six thousand years, each of which might fill a  volume, I have sought to present what is true rather than what is new.    Although most of these Lectures have been delivered, in some form,  during the last forty years, in most of the cities and in many of the  literary institutions of this country, I have carefully revised them  within the last few years, in order to avail myself of the latest light  shed on the topics and times of which they treat.    The revived and wide-spread attention given to the study of the Bible,  under the stimulus of recent Oriental travels and investigations, not  only as a volume of religious guidance, but as an authentic record of  most interesting and important events, has encouraged me to include a  series of Lectures on some of the remarkable men identified with  Jewish history.    Of course I have not aimed at an exhaustive criticism in these Biblical  studies, since the topics cannot be exhausted even by the most learned  scholars; but I have sought to interest intelligent Christians by a  continuous narrative, interweaving with it the latest accessible  knowledge bearing on the main subjects. If I have persisted in adhering  to the truths that have been generally accepted for nearly two thousand  years, I have not disregarded the light which has been recently shed on  important points by the great critics of the progressive schools.    I have not aimed to be exhaustive, or to give minute criticism on  comparatively unimportant points; but the passions and interests which  have agitated nations, the ideas which great men have declared, and the  institutions which have grown out of them, have not, I trust, been  uncandidly described, nor deductions from them illogically made.    Inasmuch as the interest in the development of those great ideas and  movements which we call Civilization centres in no slight degree in the  men who were identified with them, I have endeavored to give a faithful  picture of their lives in connection with the eras and institutions  which they represent, whether they were philosophers, ecclesiastics, or  men of action.    And that we may not lose sight of the precious boons which illustrious  benefactors have been instrumental in bestowing upon mankind, it has  been my chief object to present their services, whatever may have been  their defects; since it is for _services_ that most great men are  ultimately judged, especially kings and rulers. These services,  certainly, constitute the gist of history, and it is these which I have  aspired to show.    JOHN LORD.          VOL. I.      THE OLD PAGAN CIVILIZATIONS.          CONTENTS.
