Assistant Professor of German, Harvard University    I.    The history of German literature makes mention of few men more  self-centered and at the same time more unreserved than Heinrich  Heine. It may be said that everything which Heine wrote gives us, and  was intended to give us, first of all some new impression of the  writer; so that after a perusal of his works we know him in all his  strength and weakness, as we can know only an amiable and  communicative egotist; moreover, besides losing no opportunity for  self-expression, both in and out of season, Heine published a good  deal of frankly autobiographical matter, and wrote memoirs, only  fragments of which have come down to us, but of which more than has  yet appeared will perhaps ultimately be made accessible. Heine's life,  then, is to us for the most part an open book. Nevertheless, there are  many obscure passages in it, and there remain many questions not to be  answered with certainty, the first of which is as to the date of his  birth. His own statements on this subject are contradictory, and the  original records are lost. But it seems probable that he was born on  the thirteenth of December, 1797, the eldest child of Jewish parents  recently domiciled at Duesseldorf on the Rhine.    The parentage, the place, and the time were almost equally significant  aspects of the constellation under which young Harry Heine--for so he  was first named--began his earthly career. He was born a Jew in a  German city which, with a brief interruption, was for the first  sixteen years of his life administered by the French. The citizens of  Duesseldorf in general had little reason, except for high taxes and the  hardships incident to conscription in the French armies, to complain  of the foreign dominion. Their trade flourished, they were given  better laws, and the machinery of justice was made much less  cumbersome than it had been before. But especially the Jews hailed the  French as deliverers; for now for the first time they were relieved of  political disabilities and were placed upon a footing of equality with  the gentile population. To Jew and gentile alike the military  achievements of the French were a source of satisfaction and  admiration; and when the Emperor of the French himself came to town,  as Heine saw him do in 1810, we can easily understand how the  enthusiasm of the boy surrounded the person of Napoleon, and the idea  that he was supposed to represent, with a glamor that never lost its  fascination for the man. To Heine, Napoleon was the incarnation of the  French Revolution, the glorious new-comer who took by storm the  intrenched strongholds of hereditary privilege, the dauntless leader  in whose army every common soldier carried a field marshal's baton in  his knapsack. If later we find Heine mercilessly assailing the  repressive and reactionary aristocracy of Germany, we shall not  lightly accuse him of lack of patriotism. He could not be expected to  hold dear institutions of which he felt only the burden, without a  share in the sentiment which gives stability even to institutions that  have outlived their usefulness. Nor shall we call him a traitor for  loving the French, a people to whom his people owed so much, and to  whom he was spiritually akin.    French influences, almost as early as Hebrew or German, were among the  formative forces brought to bear upon the quick-witted but not  precocious boy. Heine's parents were orthodox, but by no means bigoted  Jews. We read with amazement that one of the plans of the mother,  ambitious for her firstborn, was to make of him a Roman Catholic  priest. The boy's father, Samson Heine, was a rather unsuccessful  member of a family which in other representatives--particularly  Samson's brother Salomon in Hamburg--attained to wealth and prominence  in the world of finance.    [Illustration: W. KRAUSKOPF HEINRICH HEINE After a Drawing in the  Possession of Mr. Carl Meinert in Dessau]    Samson Heine seems to have been too easy-going, self-indulgent, and  ostentatious, to have made the most of the talents that he  unquestionably had. Among his foibles was a certain fondness for the  pageantry of war, and he was in all his glory as an officer of the  local militia. To his son Gustav he transmitted real military  capacity, which led to a distinguished career and a patent of nobility  in the Austrian service. Harry Heine inherited his father's more  amiable but less strenuous qualities. Inquisitive and alert, he was  rather impulsive than determined, and his practical mother had her  trials in directing him toward preparation for a life work, the  particular field of which neither she nor he could readily choose.  Peira, or Betty, Heine was a stronger character than her husband; and  in her family, several members of which had taken high rank as  physicians, there had prevailed a higher degree of intellectual  culture than the Heines had attained to. She not only managed the  household with prudence and energy, but also took the chief care of  the education of the children. To both parents Harry Heine paid the  homage of true filial affection; and of the happiness of the home  life, _The Book Le Grand_ and a number of poems bear unmistakable  witness. The poem \"My child, we were two children\" gives a true  account of Harry and his sister Charlotte at play.    In Duesseldorf, Heine's formal education culminated in attendance in  the upper classes of a Lyceum, organized upon the model of a French  Lycee and with a corps of teachers recruited chiefly from the ranks of  the Roman Catholic clergy. The spirit of the institution was  rationalistic and the discipline wholesome. Here Heine made solid  acquisitions in history, literature, and the elements of philosophy.  Outside of school, he was an eager spectator, not merely of stirring  events in the world of politics, but also of many a picturesque  manifestation of popular life--a spectator often rather than a  participant; for as a Jew he stood beyond the pale of both the German  and the Roman Catholic traditions that gave and give to the cities of  the Rhineland their characteristic naive gaiety and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team        THE VIRGINIA HOUSEWIFE    Or, Methodical Cook    By    MRS. MARY RANDOLPH    1860              Method Is the Soul of Management          PREFACE    The difficulties I encountered when I first entered on the duties of a  housekeeping life, from the want of books sufficiently clear and concise  to impart knowledge to a Tyro, compelled me to study the subject, and by  actual experiment to reduce every thing in the culinary line, to proper  weights and measures. This method I found not only to diminish the  necessary attention and labour, but to be also economical: for, when the  ingredients employed were given in just proportions, the article made  was always equally good. The government of a family, bears a Lilliputian  resemblance to the government of a nation. The contents of the Treasury  must be known, and great care taken to keep the expenditures from being  equal to the receipts. A regular system must be introduced into each  department, which may be modified until matured, and should then pass  into an inviolable law. The grand arcanum of management lies in three  simple rules:--\"Let every thing be done at a proper time, keep every  thing in its proper place, and put every thing to its proper use.\" If  the mistress of a family, will every morning examine minutely the  different departments of her household, she must detect errors in their  infant state, when they can be corrected with ease; but a few days'  growth gives them gigantic strength: and disorder, with all her  attendant evils, are introduced. Early rising is also essential to the  good government of a family. A late breakfast deranges the whole  business of the day, and throws a portion of it on the next, which opens  the door for confusion to enter. The greater part of the following  receipts have been written from memory, where they were impressed by  long continued practice. Should they prove serviceable to the young  inexperienced housekeeper, it will add greatly to that gratification  which an extensive circulation of the work will be likely to confer.    M. RANDOLPH. Washington, January, 1831.          INTRODUCTION.    Management is an art that may be acquired by every woman of good sense  and tolerable memory. If, unfortunately, she has been bred in a family  where domestic business is the work of chance, she will have many  difficulties to encounter; but a determined resolution to obtain this  valuable knowledge, will enable her to surmount all obstacles. She must  begin the day with an early breakfast, requiring each person to be in  readiness to take their seats when the muffins, buckwheat cakes, &c. are  placed on the table. This looks social and comfortable. When the family  breakfast by detachments, the table remains a tedious time; the servants  are kept from their morning's meal, and a complete derangement takes  place in the whole business of the day. No work can be done till  breakfast is finished. The Virginia ladies, who are proverbially good  managers, employ themselves, while their servants are eating, in washing  the cups, glasses, &c.; arranging the cruets, the mustard, salt-sellers,  pickle vases, and all the apparatus for the dinner table. This occupies  but a short time, and the lady has the satisfaction of knowing that they  are in much better order than they would be if left to the servants. It  also relieves her from the trouble of seeing the dinner table prepared,  which should be done every day with the same scrupulous regard to exact  neatness and method, as if a grand company was expected. When the  servant is required to do this daily, he soon gets into the habit of  doing it well; and his mistress having made arrangements for him in the  morning, there is no fear of bustle and confusion in running after  things that may be called for during the hour of dinner. When the  kitchen breakfast is over, and the cook has put all things in their  proper places, the mistress should go in to give her orders. Let all the  articles intended for the dinner, pass in review before her: have the  butter, sugar, flour, meal, lard, given out in proper quantities; the  catsup, spice, wine, whatever may be wanted for each dish, measured to  the cook. The mistress must tax her own memory with all this: we have no  right to expect slaves or hired servants to be more attentive to our  interest than we ourselves are: they will never recollect these little  articles until they are going to use them; the mistress must then be  called out, and thus have the horrible drudgery of keeping house all  day, when one hour devoted to it in the morning, would release her from  trouble until the next day. There is economy as well as comfort in a  regular mode of doing business. When the mistress gives out every thing,  there is no waste; but if temptation be thrown in the way of  subordinates, not many will have power to resist it; besides, it is an  immoral act to place them in a situation which we pray to be exempt from  ourselves.    The prosperity and happiness of a family depend greatly on the order and  regularity established in it. The husband, who can ask a friend to  partake of his dinner in full confidence of finding his wife unruffled  by the petty vexations attendant on the neglect of household duties--who  can usher his guest into the dining-room assured of seeing that  methodical nicety which is the essence of true elegance,--will feel  pride and exultation in the possession of a companion, who gives to his  home charms that gratify every wish of his soul, and render the haunts  of dissipation hateful to him. The sons bred in such a family will be  moral men, of steady habits; and the daughters, if the mother shall have  performed the duties of a parent in the superintendence of their  education, as faithfully as she has done those of a wife, will each be a  treasure to her husband; and being formed on the model of an exemplary  mother, will use the same means for securing the happiness of her own  family, which she has seen successfully practised under the paternal  roof.
