Its purpose is also to see the  historical context in which our legal doctrines developed. It  includes the inception of the common law system, which was praised  because it made law which was not handed down by an absolutist  king; the origin of the jury system; the meaning of the Magna  Carta provisions in their historical context; and the emergence of  attorneys.    This book is a primer. One may read it without prior knowledge of  history or law, although it will be more meaningful to attorneys  than to others. It can serve as an introduction on which to base  further reading in English legal history. It defines terms unique  to English legal history. However, the meaning of some terms in  King Aethelbert's code in Chapter 1 are unknown or inexact.    In the Table of Contents, the title of each chapter denotes an  important legal development in the given time period for that  chapter. Each chapter is divided into three sections: The Times,  The Law, and Judicial Procedure.    The Times section sets a background and context in which to better  understand the law of that period. The usual subject matter of  history such as battles, wars, royal intrigues, periods of  corruption, and international relations are omitted as not helping  to understand the process of civilization and development of the  law. Standard practices are described, but there are often  variations with locality. Also, change did not come abruptly, but  with vacillations, e.g. the change from pagan to Christian belief  and the change to allowance of loans for interest. The scientific  revolution was accepted only slowly. There were often many  attempts made for change before it actually occurred, e.g. gaining  Parliamentary power over the king's privileges, such as taxation.    The Law section describes the law governing the behavior and  conduct of the populace. It includes law of that time which is the  same, similar, or a building block to the law of today. In earlier  times this is both statutory law and the common law of the courts.  The Magna Carta, which is quoted in Chapter 7, is the first  statute of England and is listed first in the \"Statutes of the  Realm\" and the \"Statutes at Large\". The law sections of Chapters 7  - 18 mainly quote or paraphrase most of these statutes. Excluded  are statutes which do not help us understand the development of  our law, such as statutes governing Wales after its conquest and  statutes on succession rights to the throne.    The Judicial Procedure section describes the process of applying  the law and trying cases, and jurisdictions. It also contains some  examples of cases.    For easy comparison, amounts of money expressed in pounds or marks  [Danish denomination] have often been converted to the smaller  denominations of shillings and pence. There are twenty shillings  in a pound. A mark in silver is two-thirds of a pound. Shillings  are abbreviated: \"s.\" There are twelve pennies or pence in a  Norman shilling. Pence are abbreviated \"d.\" Six shillings and two  pence is denoted 6s.2d. A scaett was a coin of silver and copper  of lesser denomination than a shilling. There were no coins of the  denomination of shilling during Anglo-Saxon times.    The sources and reference books from which information was  obtained are listed in a bibliography instead of being contained  in tedious footnotes. There is no index to pages because the  electronic text will print out its pages differently on different  computers with different computer settings. Instead, a word search  may be done on the electronic text.

At first,  people hunted and gathered their food. They wore animal skins over  their bodies for warmth and around their feet for protection when  walking. These skins were sewn together with bone needles and  threads made from animal sinews. They carried small items by  hooking them onto their belts. They used bone and stone tools,  e.g. for preparing skins. Their uncombed hair was held by  thistlethorns, animal spines, or straight bone hair pins. They  wore conical hats of bound rush and lived in rush shelters.    Early clans, headed by kings, lived in huts on top of hills or  other high places and fortified by circular or contour earth  ditches and banks behind which they could gather for protection.  They were probably dug with antler picks and wood spades. The  people lived in rectangular huts with four wood posts supporting a  roof. The walls were made of saplings, and a mixture of mud and  straw. Cooking was in a clay oven inside or over an open fire on  the outside. Water was carried in animal skins or leather pouches  from springs lower on the hill up to the settlement. Forests  abounded with wolves, bears, deer, wild boars, and wild cattle.  They could more easily be seen from the hill tops. Pathways  extended through this camp of huts and for many miles beyond.    For wives, men married women of their clan or bought or captured  other women, perhaps with the help of a best man. They carried  their unwilling wives over the thresholds of their huts, which  were sometimes in places kept secret from her family. The first  month of marriage was called the honeymoon because the couple was  given mead, a drink with fermented honey and herbs, for the first  month of their marriage. A wife wore a gold wedding band on the  ring finger of her left hand to show that she was married.    Women usually stayed at home caring for children, preparing meals,  and making baskets. They also made wool felt and spun and wove  wool into a coarse cloth. Flax was grown and woven into a coarse  linen cloth. Spinning the strands into one continuous thread was  done on a stick, which the woman could carry about and spin at  anytime when her hands were free. The weaving was done on an  upright or warp-weighted loom. People of means draped the cloth  around their bodies and fastened it with a metal brooch inlayed  with gold, gems, and shell, which were glued on with glue that was  obtained from melting animal hooves. People drank from hollowed-  out animal horns, which they could carry from belts. They could  tie things with rawhide strips or rope braids they made. Kings  drank from animal horns decorated with gold or from cups of amber,  shale, or pure gold. Men and women wore pendants and necklaces of  colorful stones, shells, amber beads, bones, and deer teeth. They  skinned and cut animals with hand-axes and knives made of flint  dug up from pits and formed by hitting flakes off. The speared  fish with barbed bone prongs or wrapped bait around a flint, bone,  or shell fish hook. On the coast, they made bone harpoons for  deep-sea fish. The flint ax was used to shape wood and bone and  was just strong enough to fell a tree, although the process was  very slow.    The king, who was tall and strong, led his men in hunting groups  to kill deer and other wild animals in the forests and to fish in  the streams. Some men brought their hunting dogs on leashes to  follow scent trails to the animal. The men threw stones and spears  with flint points at the animals. They used wood clubs to beat  them, at the same time using wood shields to protect their bodies.  They watched the phases of the moon and learned to predict when it  would be full and give the most light for night hunting. This  began the concept of a month."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#1)"],[1,"HINDU-YOGI Science _of_ Breath          A Complete Manual of THE ORIENTAL BREATHING PHILOSOPHY of Physical,  Mental, Psychic and Spiritual Development.

The Western student is apt to be somewhat confused in his ideas  regarding the Yogis and their philosophy and practice. Travelers to  India have written great tales about the hordes of fakirs, mendicants  and mountebanks who infest the great roads of India and the streets of  its cities, and who impudently claim the title \"Yogi.\" The Western  student is scarcely to be blamed for thinking of the typical Yogi as  an emaciated, fanatical, dirty, ignorant Hindu, who either sits in a  fixed posture until his body becomes ossified, or else holds his arm  up in the air until it becomes stiff and withered and forever after  remains in that position, or perhaps clenches his fist and holds it  tight until his fingernails grow through the palms of his hands. That  these people exist is true, but their claim to the title \"Yogi\" seems  as absurd to the true Yogi as does the claim to the title \"Doctor\" on  the part of the man who pares one's corns seem to the eminent surgeon,  or as does the title of \"Professor,\" as assumed by the street corner  vendor of worm medicine, seem to the President of Harvard or Yale.    There have been for ages past in India and other Oriental countries  men who devoted their time and attention to the development of Man,  physically, mentally and spiritually. The experience of generations of  earnest seekers has been handed down for centuries from teacher to  pupil, and gradually a definite Yogi science was built up. To these  investigations and teachings was finally applied the term \"Yogi,\" from  the Sanscrit word \"Yug,\" meaning \"to join.\" From the same source comes  the English word \"yoke,\" with a similar meaning. Its use in connection  with these teachings is difficult to trace, different authorities  giving different explanations, but probably the most ingenious is that  which holds that it is intended as the Hindu equivalent for the idea  conveyed by the English phrase, \"getting into harness,\" or \"yoking  up,\" as the Yogi undoubtedly \"gets into harness\" in his work of  controlling the body and mind by the Will.    Yoga is divided into several branches, ranging from that which teaches  the control of the body, to that which teaches the attainment of the  highest spiritual development. In the work we will not go into the  higher phases of the subject, except when the \"Science of Breath\"  touches upon the same. The \"Science of Breath\" touches Yoga at many  points, and although chiefly concerned with the development and  control of the physical, has also its psychic side, and even enters  the field of spiritual development.    In India there are great schools of Yoga, comprising thousands of the  leading minds of that great country. The Yoga philosophy is the rule  of life for many people. The pure Yogi teachings, however, are given  only to the few, the masses being satisfied with the crumbs which fall  from the tables of the educated classes, the Oriental custom in this  respect being opposed to that of the Western world. But Western ideas  are beginning to have their effect even in the Orient, and teachings  which were once given only to the few are now freely offered to any  who are ready to receive them. The East and the West are growing  closer together, and both are profiting by the close contact, each  influencing the other.    The Hindu Yogis have always paid great attention to the Science of  Breath, for reasons which will be apparent to the student who reads  this book. Many Western writers have touched upon this phase of the  Yogi teachings, but we believe that it has been reserved for the  writer of this work to give to the Western student, in concise form  and simple language, the underlying principles of the Yogi Science of  Breath, together with many of the favorite Yogi breathing exercises  and methods. We have given the Western idea as well as the Oriental,  showing how one dovetails into the other. We have used the ordinary  English terms, almost entirely, avoiding the Sanscrit terms, so  confusing to the average Western reader.    The first part of the book is devoted to the physical phase of the  Science of Breath; then the psychic and mental sides are considered,  and finally the spiritual side is touched upon.    We may be pardoned if we express ourselves as pleased with our success  in condensing so much Yogi lore into so few pages, and by the use of  words and terms which may be understood by anyone. Our only fear is  that its very simplicity may cause some to pass it by as unworthy of  attention, while they pass on their way searching for something  \"deep,\" mysterious and non-understandable. However, the Western mind  is eminently practical, and we know that it is only a question of a  short time before it will recognize the practicability of this work.    We greet our students, with our most profound salaam, and bid them be  seated for their first lessons in the Yogi Science of Breath.          CHAPTER II.      \"BREATH IS LIFE.\"    Life is absolutely dependent upon the act of breathing. \"Breath is  Life.\"    Differ as they may upon details of theory and terminology, the  Oriental and the Occidental agree upon these fundamental principles.    To breathe is to live, and without breath there is no life. Not only  are the higher animals dependent upon breath for life and health, but  even the lower forms of animal life must breathe to live, and plant  life is likewise dependent upon the air for continued existence.    The infant draws in a long, deep breath, retains it for a moment to  extract from it its life-giving properties, and then exhales it in a  long wail, and lo! its life upon earth has begun. The old man gives a  faint gasp, ceases to breathe, and life is over. From the first faint  breath of the infant to the last gasp of the dying man, it is one long  story of continued breathing. Life is but a series of breaths.    Breathing may be considered the most important of all of the functions  of the body, for, indeed, all the other functions depend upon it. Man  may exist some time without eating; a shorter time without drinking;  but without breathing his existence may be measured by a few minutes.    And not only is Man dependent upon Breath for life, but he is largely  dependent upon correct habits of breathing for continued vitality and  freedom from disease. An intelligent control of our breathing power  will lengthen our days upon earth by giving us increased vitality and  powers of resistance, and, on the other hand, unintelligent and  careless breathing will tend to shorten our days, by decreasing our  vitality and laying us open to disease.    Man in his normal state had no need of instruction in breathing. Like  the lower animal and the child, he breathed naturally and properly, as  nature intended him to do, but civilization has changed him in this  and other respects. He has contracted improper methods and attitudes  of walking, standing and sitting, which have robbed him of his  birthright of natural and correct breathing. He has paid a high price  for civilization. The savage, to-day, breathes naturally, unless he  has been contaminated by the habits of civilized man.    The percentage of civilized men who breathe correctly is quite small,  and the result is shown in contracted chests and stooping shoulders,  and the terrible increase in diseases of the respiratory organs,  including that dread monster, Consumption, \"the white scourge.\"  Eminent authorities have stated that one generation of correct  breathers would regenerate the race, and disease would be so rare as  to be looked upon as a curiosity. Whether looked at from the  standpoint of the Oriental or Occidental, the connection between  correct breathing and health is readily seen and explained.    The Occidental teachings show that the physical health depends very  materially upon correct breathing. The Oriental teachers not only  admit that their Occidental brothers are right, but say that in  addition to the physical benefit derived from correct habits of  breathing, Man's mental power, happiness, self-control,  clear-sightedness, morals, and even his spiritual growth may be  increased by an understanding of the \"Science of Breath.\" Whole  schools of Oriental Philosophy have been founded upon this science,  and this knowledge when grasped by the Western races, and by them put  to the practical use which is their strong point, will work wonders  among them. The theory of the East, wedded to the practice of the  West, will produce worthy offspring.    This work will take up the Yogi \"Science of Breath,\" which includes  not only all that is known to the Western physiologist and hygienist,  but the occult side of the subject as well. It not only points out the  way to physical"]]]
