ORTHODOXY    by    GILBERT K. CHESTERTON                PREFACE           This book is meant to be a companion to \"Heretics,\" and to  put the positive side in addition to the negative.  Many critics  complained of the book called \"Heretics\" because it merely criticised  current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy.  This book is an attempt to answer the challenge.  It is unavoidably  affirmative and therefore unavoidably autobiographical.  The writer has  been driven back upon somewhat the same difficulty as that which beset  Newman in writing his Apologia; he has been forced to be egotistical  only in order to be sincere.  While everything else may be different  the motive in both cases is the same.  It is the purpose of the writer  to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can  be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.  The book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle  and its answer.  It deals first with all the writer's own solitary  and sincere speculations and then with all the startling style in  which they were all suddenly satisfied by the Christian Theology.  The writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed.  But if  it is not that it is at least a repeated and surprising coincidence.                                               Gilbert K.

Authority and the Adventurer            ORTHODOXY        I INTRODUCTION IN DEFENCE OF EVERYTHING ELSE           THE only possible excuse for this book is that it is an answer  to a challenge.  Even a bad shot is dignified when he accepts a duel.  When some time ago I published a series of hasty but sincere papers,  under the name of \"Heretics,\" several critics for whose intellect  I have a warm respect (I may mention specially Mr. G.S.Street)  said that it was all very well for me to tell everybody to affirm  his cosmic theory, but that I had carefully avoided supporting my  precepts with example.  \"I will begin to worry about my philosophy,\"  said Mr. Street, \"when Mr. Chesterton has given us his.\"  It was perhaps an incautious suggestion to make to a person  only too ready to write books upon the feeblest provocation.  But after all, though Mr. Street has inspired and created this book,  he need not read it.  If he does read it, he will find that in  its pages I have attempted in a vague and personal way, in a set  of mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions, to state  the philosophy in which I have come to believe.  I will not call it  my philosophy; for I did not make it.  God and humanity made it;  and it made me.         I have often had a fancy for writing a romance about an English  yachtsman who slightly miscalculated his course and discovered England  under the impression that it was a new island in the South Seas.  I always find, however, that I am either too busy or too lazy to  write this fine work, so I may as well give it away for the purposes  of philosophical illustration.  There will probably be a general  impression that the man who landed (armed to the teeth and talking  by signs) to plant the British flag on that barbaric temple which  turned out to be the Pavilion at Brighton, felt rather a fool.  I am not here concerned to deny that he looked a fool.  But if you  imagine that he felt a fool, or at any rate that the sense of folly  was his sole or his dominant emotion, then you have not studied  with sufficient delicacy the rich romantic nature of the hero  of this tale.  His mistake was really a most enviable mistake;  and he knew it, if he was the man I take him for.  What could  be more delightful than to have in the same few minutes all the  fascinating terrors of going abroad combined with all the humane  security of coming home again?  What could be better than to have  all the fun of discovering South Africa without the disgusting  necessity of landing there?  What could be more glorious than to  brace one's self up to discover New South Wales and then realize,  with a gush of happy tears, that it was really old South Wales.  This at least seems to me the main problem for philosophers, and is  in a manner the main problem of this book.  How can we contrive  to be at once astonished at the world and yet at home in it?  How can this queer cosmic town, with its many-legged citizens,  with its monstrous and ancient lamps, how can this world give us  at once the fascination of a strange town and the comfort and honour  of being our own town?         To show that a faith or a philosophy is true from every  standpoint would be too big an undertaking even for a much bigger  book than this; it is necessary to follow one path of argument;  and this is the path that I here propose to follow.  I wish to set  forth my faith as particularly answering this double spiritual need,  the need for that mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar  which Christendom has rightly named romance.  For the very word  \"romance\" has in it the mystery and ancient meaning of Rome.  Any one setting out to dispute anything ought always to begin by  saying what he does not dispute.  Beyond stating what he proposes  to prove he should always state what he does not propose to prove.  The thing I do not propose to prove, the thing I propose to take  as common ground between myself and any average reader, is this  desirability of an active and imaginative life, picturesque and full  of a poetical curiosity, a life such as western man at any rate always  seems to have desired.  If a man says that extinction is better  than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure,  then he is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking.  If a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing.  But nearly all  people I have ever met in this western society in which I live  would agree to the general proposition that we need this life  of practical romance; the combination of something that is strange  with something that is secure.  We need so to view the world as to  combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome.  We need to be  happy in this wonderland without once being merely comfortable.  It is THIS achievement of my creed that I shall chiefly pursue in  these pages.         But I have a peculiar reason for mentioning the man in  a yacht, who discovered England.  For I am that man in a yacht.  I discovered England.  I do not see how this book can avoid  being egotistical; and I do not quite see (to tell the truth)  how it can avoid being dull.  Dulness will, however, free me from  the charge which I most lament; the charge of being flippant.  Mere light sophistry is the thing that I happen to despise most of  all things, and it is perhaps a wholesome fact that this is the thing  of which I am generally accused.  I know nothing so contemptible  as a mere paradox; a mere ingenious defence of the indefensible.  If it were true (as has been said) that Mr. Bernard Shaw lived  upon paradox, then he ought to be a mere common millionaire;  for a man of his mental activity could invent a sophistry every  six minutes.  It is as easy as lying; because it is lying.  The truth is, of course, that Mr. Shaw is cruelly hampered by the  fact that he cannot tell any lie unless he thinks it is the truth.  I find myself under the same intolerable bondage.  I never in my life  said anything merely because I thought it funny; though of course,  I have had ordinary human vainglory, and may have thought it funny  because I had said it.  It is one thing to describe an interview  with a gorgon or a griffin, a creature who does not exist.  It is another thing to discover that the rhinoceros does exist  and then take pleasure in the fact that he looks as if he didn't.  One searches for truth, but it may be that one pursues instinctively  the more extraordinary truths.  And I offer this book with the  heartiest sentiments to all the jolly people who hate what I write,  and regard it (very justly, for all I know), as a piece of poor  clowning or a single tiresome joke.         For if this book is a joke it is a joke against me.  I am the man who with the utmost daring discovered what had been  discovered before.  If there is an element of farce in what follows,  the farce is at my own expense; for this book explains how I fancied I  was the first to set foot in Brighton and then found I was the last.  It recounts my elephantine adventures in pursuit of the obvious.  No one can think my case more ludicrous than I think it myself;  no reader can accuse me here of trying to make a fool of him:  I am the fool of this story, and no rebel shall hurl me from  my throne.  I freely confess all the idiotic ambitions of the end  of the nineteenth century.  I did, like all other solemn little boys,  try to be in advance of the age.  Like them I tried to be some ten  minutes in advance of the truth.  And I found that I was eighteen  hundred years behind it.  I did strain my voice with a painfully  juvenile exaggeration in uttering my truths.  And I was punished  in the fittest and funniest way, for I have kept my truths:  but I have discovered, not that they were not truths, but simply that  they were not mine.  When I fancied that I stood alone I was really  in the ridiculous position of being backed up by all Christendom.  It may be, Heaven forgive me, that I did try to be original;  but I only succeeded in inventing all by myself an inferior copy  of the existing traditions of civilized religion.  The man from  the yacht thought he was the first to find England; I thought I was  the first to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#1)"],[1,"OF THE PURPLE SAGE    By Zane Grey          CHAPTER I. LASSITER    A sharp clip-crop of iron-shod hoofs deadened and died away, and clouds  of yellow dust drifted from under the cottonwoods out over the sage.    Jane Withersteen gazed down the wide purple slope with dreamy and  troubled eyes. A rider had just left her and it was his message that  held her thoughtful and almost sad, awaiting the churchmen who were  coming to resent and attack her right to befriend a Gentile.    She wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the  little village of Cottonwoods was to involve her. And then she sighed,  remembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement  of southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the  ground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the  great ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of  the sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure  and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple  upland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell  Cottonwoods.    That year, 1871, had marked a change which had been gradually coming  in the lives of the peace-loving Mormons of the border. Glaze--Stone  Bridge--Sterling, villages to the north, had risen against the  invasion of Gentile settlers and the forays of rustlers. There had been  opposition to the one and fighting with the other. And now Cottonwoods  had begun to wake and bestir itself and grown hard.    Jane prayed that the tranquillity and sweetness of her life would not be  permanently disrupted. She meant to do so much more for her people than  she had done. She wanted the sleepy quiet pastoral days to last always.  Trouble between the Mormons and the Gentiles of the community would  make her unhappy. She was Mormon-born, and she was a friend to poor  and unfortunate Gentiles. She wished only to go on doing good and being  happy. And she thought of what that great ranch meant to her. She loved  it all--the grove of cottonwoods, the old stone house, the amber-tinted  water, and the droves of shaggy, dusty horses and mustangs, the sleek,  clean-limbed, blooded racers, and the browsing herds of cattle and the  lean, sun-browned riders of the sage.    While she waited there she forgot the prospect of untoward change. The  bray of a lazy burro broke the afternoon quiet, and it was comfortingly  suggestive of the drowsy farmyard, and the open corrals, and the green  alfalfa fields. Her clear sight intensified the purple sage-slope as it  rolled before her. Low swells of prairie-like ground sloped up to  the west. Dark, lonely cedar-trees, few and far between, stood out  strikingly, and at long distances ruins of red rocks. Farther on, up the  gradual slope, rose a broken wall, a huge monument, looming dark purple  and stretching its solitary, mystic way, a wavering line that faded  in the north. Here to the westward was the light and color and beauty.  Northward the slope descended to a dim line of canyons from which rose  an up-flinging of the earth, not mountainous, but a vast heave of purple  uplands, with ribbed and fan-shaped walls, castle-crowned cliffs, and  gray escarpments. Over it all crept the lengthening, waning afternoon  shadows.    The rapid beat of hoofs recalled Jane Withersteen to the question at  hand. A group of riders cantered up the lane, dismounted, and threw  their bridles. They were seven in number, and Tull, the leader, a tall,  dark man, was an elder of Jane's church.    \"Did you get my message?\" he asked, curtly.    \"Yes,\" replied Jane.    \"I sent word I'd give that rider Venters half an hour to come down to  the village. He didn't come.\"    \"He knows nothing of it;\" said Jane. \"I didn't tell him. I've been  waiting here for you.\"    \"Where is Venters?\"    \"I left him in the courtyard.\"    \"Here, Jerry,\" called Tull, turning to his men, \"take the gang and fetch  Venters out here if you have to rope him.\"    The dusty-booted and long-spurred riders clanked noisily into the grove  of cottonwoods and disappeared in the shade.    \"Elder Tull, what do you mean by this?\" demanded Jane. \"If you must  arrest Venters you might have the courtesy to wait till he leaves my  home. And if you do arrest him it will be adding insult to injury. It's  absurd to accuse Venters of being mixed up in that shooting fray in the  village last night. He was with me at the time. Besides, he let me take  charge of his guns. You're only using this as a pretext. What do you  mean to do to Venters?\"    \"I'll tell you presently,\" replied Tull. \"But first tell me why you  defend this worthless rider?\"    \"Worthless!\" exclaimed Jane, indignantly. \"He's nothing of the kind.  He was the best rider I ever had. There's not a reason why I shouldn't  champion him and every reason why I should. It's no little shame to me,  Elder Tull, that through my friendship he has roused the enmity of my  people and become an outcast. Besides I owe him eternal gratitude for  saving the life of little Fay.\"    \"I've heard of your love for Fay Larkin and that you intend to adopt  her. But--Jane Withersteen, the child is a Gentile!\"    \"Yes. But, Elder, I don't love the Mormon children any less because I  love a Gentile child. I shall adopt Fay if her mother will give her to  me.\"    \"I'm not so much against that. You can give the child Mormon teaching,\"  said Tull. \"But I'm sick of seeing this fellow Venters hang around you.  I'm going to put a stop to it. You've so much love to throw away on  these beggars of Gentiles that I've an idea you might love Venters.\"    Tull spoke with the arrogance of a Mormon whose power could not be  brooked and with the passion of a man in whom jealousy had kindled a  consuming fire.    \"Maybe I do love him,\" said Jane. She felt both fear and anger stir her  heart. \"I'd never thought of that. Poor fellow! he certainly needs some  one to love him.\"    \"This'll be a bad day for Venters unless you deny that,\" returned Tull,  grimly.    Tull's men appeared under the cottonwoods and led a young man out into  the lane. His ragged clothes were those of an outcast. But he stood tall  and straight, his wide shoulders flung back, with the muscles of his  bound arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in the gaze he bent on  Tull.    For the first time Jane Withersteen felt Venters's real spirit. She  wondered if she would love this splendid youth. Then her emotion cooled  to the sobering sense of the issue at stake.    \"Venters, will you leave Cottonwoods at once and forever?\" asked Tull,  tensely.    \"Why?\" rejoined the rider.    \"Because I order it.\"    Venters laughed in cool disdain.    The red leaped to Tull's dark cheek.    \"If you don't go it means your ruin,\" he said, sharply.    \"Ruin!\" exclaimed Venters, passionately. \"Haven't you already ruined me?  What do you call ruin? A year ago I was a rider. I had horses and cattle  of my own. I had a good name in Cottonwoods. And now when I come into  the village to see this woman you set your men on me. You hound me. You  trail me as if I were a rustler. I've no more to lose--except my life.\"    \"Will you leave Utah?\"    \"Oh! I know,\" went on Venters, tauntingly, \"it galls you, the idea of  beautiful Jane Withersteen being friendly to a poor Gentile. You want  her all yourself. You're a wiving Mormon. You have use for her--and  Withersteen House and Amber Spring and seven thousand head of cattle!\"    Tull's hard jaw protruded, and rioting blood corded the veins of his  neck.    \"Once more. Will you go?\"    \"NO!\"    \"Then I'll have you whipped within an inch of your life,\" replied Tull,  harshly. \"I'll turn you out in the sage. And if you ever come back  you'll get worse.\"    Venters's agitated face grew coldly set and the bronze changed    Jane impulsively stepped forward. \"Oh! Elder Tull!\" she cried. \"You  won't do that!\"    Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her.    \"That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy  to a friendship that's offensive to your Bishop. Jane Withersteen, your  father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't  yet come to see the place of Mormon women. We've reasoned with you,  borne with you. We've patiently waited. We've let you have your fling,  which is more than I ever saw granted to a Mormon woman. But you haven't  come to your senses. Now, once for all, you can't have any further  friendship with Venters. He's going to be whipped, and he's got to leave  Utah!\"    \"Oh! Don't whip him! It would be dastardly!\" implored Jane, with slow  certainty of her failing courage.    Tull always blunted her spirit, and she grew conscious that she had  feigned a boldness which she did not possess. He loomed up now in  different guise, not as a jealous suitor, but embodying the mysterious  despotism she had known from childhood--the power of her creed.    \"Venters, will you take your whipping here or would you rather go out  in the sage?\" asked Tull. He smiled a flinty smile that was more  than inhuman, yet seemed to give out of its dark aloofness a gleam of  righteousness.    \"I'll take it here--if I must,\" said Venters. \"But by God!--Tull you'd  better kill me outright. That'll be a dear whipping for you and your  praying Mormons. You'll make me another Lassiter!\"    The strange glow, the austere light which radiated from Tull's face,  might have been a holy joy at the spiritual conception of exalted duty.  But there was something more in him, barely hidden, a something personal  and sinister, a deep of himself, an engulfing abyss. As his religious  mood was fanatical and inexorable, so would his physical hate be  merciless.    \"Elder, I--I repent my words,\" Jane faltered. The religion in her, the  long habit of obedience, of humility, as well as agony of fear, spoke in  her voice. \"Spare the boy!\" she whispered.    \"You can't save him now,\" replied Tull stridently.    Her head was"]]]
