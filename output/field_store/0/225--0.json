Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--                                    Nameless here for evermore.        _Ah! distinctement je me souviens que c'était en le glacial      Décembre: et chaque tison, mourant isolé, ouvrageait son spectre      sur le sol. Ardemment je souhaitais le jour--vainement j'avais      cherché d'emprunter à mes livres un sursis au chagrin--au chagrin      de la Lénore perdue--de la rare et rayonnante jeune fille que les      anges nomment Lénore:--de nom pour elle ici, non, jamais plus!_    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--                                    This it is and nothing more.\"        _Et de la soie l'incertain et triste bruissement en chaque rideau      purpural me traversait--m'emplissait de fantastiques terreurs pas      senties encore: si bien que, pour calmer le battement de mon coeur,      je demeurais maintenant à répéter «C'est quelque visiteur qui sollicite      l'entrée, à la porte de ma chambre--quelque visiteur qui sollicite      l'entrée, à la porte de ma chambre; c'est cela et rien de plus.»_    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--                                   Darkness there and nothing more.        _Mon âme devint subitement plus forte et, n'hésitant davantage      «Monsieur, dis-je, ou Madame, j'implore véritablement votre pardon;      mais le fait est que je somnolais et vous vîntes si doucement frapper,      et si faiblement vous vîntes heurter, heurter à la porte de ma chambre,      que j'étais à peine sûr de vous avoir entendu.»--Ici j'ouvris, grande,      la porte: les ténèbres et rien de plus.»_    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--                                    Merely this and nothing more.        _Loin dans l'ombre regardant, je me tins longtemps à douter,      m'étonner et craindre, à rêver des rêves qu'aucun mortel n'avait osé      rêver encore; mais le silence ne se rompit point et la quiétude ne      donna de signe: et le seul mot qui se dit, fut le mot chuchoté      «Lénore!» Je le chuchotai--et un écho murmura de retour le mot      «Lénore!»--purement cela et rien de plus._    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before,  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--  Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--                                    'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"        _Rentrant dans la chambre, toute mon âme en feu, j'entendis bientôt      un heurt en quelque sorte plus fort qu'auparavant. «Sûrement, dis-je,      sûrement c'est quelque chose à la persienne de ma fenêtre. Voyons      donc ce qu'il y a et explorons ce mystère--que  mon coeur se calme      un moment et explore ce mystère; c'est le vent et rien de plus.»_    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.  Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;  But, with mien of lord and lady, perched above my chamber door--  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--                                    Perched and sat and nothing more.        _Au large je poussai le volet; quand, avec maints enjouement et      agitation d'ailes, entra un majestueux Corbeau des saints jours de      jadis. Il ne fit pas la moindre révérence, il ne s'arrêta ni n'hésita      un instant: mais, avec une mine de lord ou de lady, se percha au-dessus      de la porte de ma chambre--se percha sur un buste de Pallas juste      au-dessus de la porte de ma chambre--se percha, siégea et rien de plus._    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"                                    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"        _Alors cet oiseau d'ébène induisant ma triste imagination au sourire,      par le grave et sévère décorum de la contenance qu'il eut: «Quoique      ta crête soit chue et rase, non! dis-je, tu n'es pas pour sûr un      poltron, spectral, lugubre et ancien Corbeau, errant loin du rivage      de Nuit--dis-moi quel est ton nom seigneurial au rivage plutonien de      Nuit.» Le Corbeau dit: «Jamais plus.»_    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                    With such a name as \"Nevermore.\"        _Je m'émerveillai fort d'entendre ce disgracieux volatile s'énoncer      aussi clairement, quoique sa réponse n'eût que peu de sens et peu      d'à-propos; car on ne peut s'empêcher de convenir que nul homme vivant      n'eût encore l'heur de voir un oiseau au-dessus de la porte de sa      chambre--un oiseau ou toute autre bête sur le buste sculpté, au-dessus      de la porte de sa chambre, avec un nom tel que: «Jamais plus.»_    But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"                                    Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"        _Mais le Corbeau, perché solitairement sur ce buste placide, parla      ce seul mot comme si, son âme, en ce seul mot, il la répandait. Je ne      proférai donc rien de plus: il n'agita donc pas de plume--jusqu'à ce      que je fis à peine davantage que marmotter «D'autres amis déjà ont      pris leur vol--demain il me laissera comme mes Espérances déjà ont      pris leur vol.» Alors l'oiseau dit: «Jamais plus.»_    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,  Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore                                    Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"        _Tressaillant au calme rompu par une réplique si bien parlée: «Sans      doute dis-je, ce qu'il profère est tout son fonds et son bagage, pris      à quelque malheureux maître que l'impitoyable Désastre suivit de près      et de très-près suivit jusqu'à ce que ses chansons comportassent un      unique refrain; jusqu'à ce que les chants funèbres de son Espérance      comportassent le mélancolique refrain de «Jamais--jamais plus.»_    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                                    Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"        _Le Corbeau induisant toute ma triste âme encore au sourire, je      roulai soudain un siége à coussins en face de l'oiseau et du buste et      de la porte; et m'enfonçant dans le velours, je me pris à enchaîner      songerie à songerie, pensant à ce que cet augural oiseau de jadis--à      ce que ce sombre,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#1)"],[1,"BURROUGHS' ENCYCLOPAEDIA    OF    ASTOUNDING FACTS    AND    USEFUL INFORMATION    1889          For Melba Conner          Universal Assistant and Treasure-House of Information to be Consulted  on Every Question That Arises in Everyday Life by Young and Old Alike!

You want some good advice. Rise early. Be abstemious. Be frugal.  Attend to your own business and never trust it to another. Be not  afraid to work, and diligently, too, with your own hands. Treat every  one with civility and respect. Good manners insure success. Accomplish  what you undertake. Decide, then persevere. Diligence and industry  overcome all difficulties. Never be mean--rather give than take the  odd shilling. Never postpone till to-morrow what can be done to-day.  Never anticipate wealth from any source but labor. Honesty is not only  the best policy, but the only policy. Commence at the first round and  keep climbing. Make your word as good as your bond. Seek knowledge to  plan, enterprise to execute, honesty to govern all. Never overtrade.  Never give too large credit. Time is money. Reckon the hours of  the day as so many dollars, the minutes as so many cents. Make few  promises. Keep your secrets. Live within your income. Sobriety above  all things. Luck is a word that does not apply to a successful  man. Not too much caution--slow but sure is the thing. The highest  monuments are built piece by piece. Step by step we mount the  pyramids. Be bold--be resolute when the clouds gather, difficulties  are surmounted by opposition. Self-confidence, self-reliance is your  capital. Your conscience the best monitor. Never be over-sanguine,  but do not underrate your own abilities. Don't be discouraged.  [Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'Ninty=nine'] Ninety-nine  may say no, the [Transcriber's Note: The original text reads  'hundreth'] hundredth, yes: take off your coat: roll up your  sleeves, don't be afraid of manual labor! America is large enough for  all--strike out for the west. The best letter of introduction is your  own energy. Lean on yourself when you walk. Keep good company. Keep  out of politics unless you are sure to win--you are never sure to  win, so look out.             *       *       *       *       *    THE ART OF PENMANSHIP    _How to Become a Handsome Writer._      The subject of the importance of good writing is as broad as its  use. Reaching out in every direction, and pervading every corner of  civilized society, from the humblest up to the highest employments,  it is a servant of man, second only in importance to that of speech  itself. In the world of business its value is seen, from the simplest  record or memorandum, up to the parchment which conveys a kingdom.  Without it, the wheels of commerce could not move a single hour. At  night it has recorded the transactions of the Bank of England during  the day; of London; of the whole world.    Through the art of writing, the deeds of men live after them, and  we may surround ourselves with the companionship of philosophers,  scientists, historians, discoverers and poets; and their discoveries,  and reasonings and imaginings become ours. In the amenities of social  life, through the medium of the pen, heart speaks to heart, though  ocean rolls between. Thoughts of tenderness and affection live when  we are gone, and words and deeds of kindness are not preserved by  monuments alone. What fountains of grief or joy have been opened in  the hearts of those who have read the records of the pen! The pen  has recorded the rapturous emotions of love reciprocated. The pen has  written the message of sadness which has covered life's pilgrimage  with gloom. The pen has traced the record of noble and useful lives,  spent in humanity's cause. The songs of the poet, the beautiful tints  of his imagination, the flights of the orator in the realms of fancy,  and the facts of history, would all perish as the dew of morning,  without this noble art of writing.    As a means of livelihood, there is perhaps no other department of  education which affords such universal and profitable employment, as  writing. From the mere copyist, up to the practical accountant, and  onward into that department of penmanship designated as a fine art,  the remuneration is always very ample, considering the time and effort  required in its acquisition.    Teachers, editors, farmers, doctors and all persons should possess a  practical and substantial knowledge of writing, and should be ready  with the pen. Business men must of course be ready writers, and hence,  in a treatise on business, designed for the education and advancement  of the youth of the country, it seems eminently fitting to first make  the way clear to a plain, practical handwriting. Neatness and accuracy  should characterize the hand-writing of every one. Botch-work and  bungling are inexcusable, as well in writing as in the transaction  of business. No person has a right to cause a tinge of shame to their  correspondent, by sending a letter addressed in a stupid and awkward  manner, nor to consume the time of another in deciphering the  illegible hooks and scrawls of a message. Every one should have the  ambition to _write_ respectably as well as to _appear_ respectable on  any occasion.      MATERIALS USED IN WRITING.    Having a suitable desk or table, arranged with reference to light, in  order to learn to write, it is necessary to be provided with proper  materials. Writing materials abundant and so cheap in these times that  no excuse is afforded for using an inferior or worthless quality. The  materials consist of _Pens, Ink_ and _Paper_.      PENS.    Steel pens are considered the best. Gold pens have the advantage of  always producing the same quality of writing, while steel pens, new or  old, produce finer or courser lines. Notwithstanding this advantage in  favor of the gold pen, steel pens adhere to the paper, and produce a  better line. The pen should be adapted to the hand of the writer. Some  persons require a coarse pen, and some fine. Elastic pens in the hand  of one writer may produce the best results, while a less flexible pen  may suit the hand of others best. Pens are manufactured of almost an  infinite grade and quality, in order to suit the requirements of all.  About the only rule that can be given in selecting pens, is to write a  few lines, or a page, with each of the pens on trial, and then compare  the writing. If it be shaded too heavily, select a less flexible pen,  if the hair lines are too delicate, select a coarser pen.      INK.    Black ink is always preferable. That which is free from sediment and  flows well, should be selected. Use an inkstand with broad base as  being less liable to upset. With persons in learning to write it is  perhaps best to have a quality of ink which is perfectly black when  put on the paper, in order that they may see the results of their  labor at once. Business men and accountants prefer a fluid ink,  however, which, although not black at first, continues to grow black,  and becomes a very bright and durable black, notwithstanding the  action of light and heat. Avoid the use of fancy colored inks,  especially the more gaudy, such as blue, red or green, in writing all  documents which you desire to command attention and respect.      PAPER.    There are almost as many grades of paper to be found in the stationery  stores, as there are of pens. For practicing penmanship, nothing is  more suitable than foolscap, which may be easily sewed into book-form,  with cover of some different color, and thus serves every requirement.  The paper should have a medium surface, neither rough and coarse, or  too fine and glazed. Have a few extra sheets beside the writing"]]]
