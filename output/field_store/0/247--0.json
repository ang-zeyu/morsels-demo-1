SHOWELL'S    ~Dictionary of Birmingham.~          ~NOTES OF BIRMINGHAM IN THE PAST.~      ~Birmingham to the Seventh Century.~--We have no record or traces  whatever of there being inhabitants in this neighbourhood, though there  can be little doubt that in the time of the invasion of the Romans some  British strongholds were within a few miles of the place, sundry remains  having been found to show that many battles had been fought near here.  If residents there were prior to King Edward the Confessor's reign, they  would probably be of Gurth's tribe, and their huts even Hutton,  antiquarian and historian as he was, failed to find traces of. How the  name of this our dwelling-place came about, nobody knows. Not less than  twelve dozen ways have been found to spell it; a score of different  derivations \"discovered\" for it; and guesses innumerable given as to its  origin, but we still wait for the information required.    ~Birmingham in the Conqueror's Days.~--The Manor was held, in 1066, by  Alwyne, son of Wigod the Dane, who married the sister of the Saxon  Leofric, Earl of Mercia. According to \"Domesday Book,\" in 1086, it was  tenanted by Richard, who, held, under William Fitz-Ansculf, and included  four hides of land and half-a-mile of wood, worth 20s.; there were 150  acres in cultivation, with but nine residents, five villeins, and four  bordarers. In 1181 there were 18 freeholders (_libere tenentes_) in  Birmingham cultivating 667 acres, and 35 tenants _in demesne_, holding  158 acres, the whole value being L13 8s. 2d.    ~Birmingham in the Feudal Period.~--The number of armed men furnished by  this town for Edward III.'s wars were four, as compared with six from  Warwick, and forty from Coventry.    ~Birmingham in the Time of the Edwards and Harrys.~--The Manor passed  from the Bermingham family in 1537, through the knavish trickery of Lord  L'Isle, to whom it was granted in 1545. The fraud, however, was not of  much service to the noble rascal, as he was beheaded for treason in  1553. In 1555 the Manor was given by Queen Mary to Thomas Marrow, of  Berkswell.    ~Birmingham in 1538.~--Leland, who visited here about this date, says in  his \"Itinerary\"--\"There be many smithies in the towne that use to make  knives and all manner of cutlery tooles, and many lorimers that make  bittes, and a great many naylors, so that a great part of the towne is  maintained by smithes, who have their iron and seacole out of  Staffordshire.\" He describes the town as consisting of one street, about  a quarter of a mile long, \"a pretty street or ever I enterd,\" and \"this  street, as I remember, is called Dirtey.\"    ~Birmingham in 1586.~--Camden in his \"Britannica,\" published this year,  speaks of \"Bremicham, swarming with inhabitants, and echoing with the  noise of anvils, for the most part of them are smiths.\"    ~Birmingham in 1627.~--In a book issued at Oxford this year mention is  made of \"Bremincham inhabited with blacksmiths, and forging sundry kinds  of iron utensils.\"    ~Birmingham in 1635.~--As showing the status the town held at this date  we find that it was assessed for \"ship money\" by Charles I. at L100, the  same as Warwick, while Sutton Coldfield had to find L80 and Coventry  L266.    ~Birmingham in 1656.~--Dugdale speaks of it as \"being a place very  eminent for most commodities made of iron.\"    ~Birmingham in 1680-90.~--Macaulay says: The population of Birmingham  was only 4,000, and at that day nobody had heard of Birmingham guns. He  also says there was not a single regular shop where a Bible or almanack  could be bought; on market days a bookseller named Michael Johnson  (father of the great Samuel Johnson) came over from Lichfield and opened  a stall for a few hours, and this supply was equal to the demand. The  gun trade, however, was introduced here very soon after, for there is  still in existence a warrant from the Office of Ordnance to \"pay to John  Smart for Thomas Hadley and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one  debenture of ffour-score and sixteen poundes and eighteen shillings,  dated ye 14th of July, 1690.\"--Alexander Missen, visiting this town in  his travels, said that \"swords, heads of canes, snuff-boxes, and other  fine works of steel,\" could be had, \"cheaper and better here than even  in famed Milan.\"    ~Birmingham in 1691.~--The author of \"The New State of England,\"  published this year, says: \"Bromichan drives a good trade in iron and  steel wares, saddles and bridles, which find good vent at London,  Ireland, and other parts.\" By another writer, \"Bromicham\" is described  as \"a large and well-built town, very populous, much resorted to, and  particularly noted a few years ago for the counterfeit groats made here,  and dispersed all oven the kingdom.\"    ~Birmingham in 1731.~--An old \"Road-book\" of this date, says that  \"Birmingham, Bromicham, or Bremicham, is a large town, well built and  populous. The inhabitants, being mostly smiths, are very ingenious in  their way, and vend vast quantities of all sorts of iron wares.\" The  first map of the town (Westley's) was published in this year. It showed  the Manorhouse on an oval island, about 126 yards long by 70 yards  extreme width, surrounded by a moat about twelve yards broad. Paradise  Street was then but a road through the fields; Easy Hill (now Easy Row),  Summer Hill, Newhall Hill, Ludgate Hill, Constitution Hill, and Snow  Hill pleasant pastures.    ~Birmingham in 1750.~--Bradford's plan of the town, published in 1751,  showed a walk by Rea side, where lovers could take a pleasant stroll  from Heath Mill Lane. The country residences at Mount Pleasant (now Ann  Street) were surrounded with gardens, and it was a common practice to  dry clothes on the hedges in Snow Hill. In \"England's Gazetteer,\"  published about this date, Birmingham or Bromichan is said to be \"a  large, well-built, and populous town, noted for the most ingenious  artificers in boxes, buckles, buttons, and other iron and steel wares;  wherein such multitudes of people are employed that they are sent all  over Europe; and here is a continual noise of hammers, anvils, and  files.\"    ~Birmingham in 1765.~--Lord and Lady Shelburne visited here in 1765. Her  ladyship kept a diary, and in it she describes Mr. Baskerville's house  (Easy Row) as \"a pretty place out of the town.\" She also mentions  visiting a Quaker's to see \"the making of guns.\"    ~Birmingham in 1766.~--In \"A New Tour through England,\" by George  Beaumont, Esq., and Capt. Henry Disney, Birmingham is described as \"a  very large populous town, the upper part of which stands dry on the side  of a hill, but the lower is watry, and inhabited by the meaner sort of  people. They are employed here in the Iron Works, in which they are such  ingenious artificers, that their performances in the smallwares of iron  and steel are admired both at home and abroad. 'Tis much improved of  late years, both in public and private buildings.\"    ~Birmingham in 1781.~--Hutton published his \"History of Birmingham\" this  year. He estimated that there were then living ninety-four townsmen who  were each worth over L5,000; eighty worth over L10,000; seventeen worth  over L20,000; eight worth over L30,000; seven worth over L50,000; and  three at least worth over L100,000 each.    ~Birmingham in 1812.~--The appearance of the town then would be strange  indeed to those who know but the Birmingham of to-day. Many  half-timbered houses remained in the Bull Ring and cows grazed near  where the Town Hall now stands, there being a farmhouse at the back of  the site of Christ Church, then being built. Recruiting parties paraded  the streets with fife and drum almost daily, and when the London mail  came in with news of some victory in Spain it was no uncommon thing for  the workmen to take the horses out and drag the coach up the Bull Ring  amid the cheers of the crowd. At night the streets were patrolled by  watchmen, with rattles and lanterns, who called the hours and the  weather.           *       *       *       *       *    ~AB House,~ so called from the initials inscribed thereon to show the  division of the parishes of Aston and Birmingham near to Deritend  Bridge. Early in 1883 part of the foundations were uncovered, showing  that the old building was raised on wooden piles, when the neighbourhood  was little better than a swamp.    ~ABC Time Table~ was first issued in July, 1853. A rival, called the  \"XYZ Time Table,\" on a system that was to make all the puzzles of  Bradshaw as plain as pikestaves, was brought out in August, 1877, but it  required such extra wise heads to understand its simplicity that before  one could be found the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#1)"],[1,"OF GUERNSEY    AND THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS    ALDERNEY, SARK, JETHOU, HERM;      BEING A SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO  The Ornitholony of the Channel Islands      BY    CECIL SMITH, F.Z.S.,    MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ORNITHOLOGIST'S UNION.      LONDON:  R.H. PORTER, 6, TENTERDEN STREET,  HANOVER SQUARE.  1879.          PREFACE.      Though perhaps not possessing the interest to the ornithologist which  Lundy Island (the only breeding-place of the Gannet in the South-West of  England) or the Scilly Islands possess, or being able to produce the  long list of birds which the indefatigable Mr. Gaeetke has been able to  do for his little island, Heligoland, the avifauna of Guernsey and the  neighbouring islands is by no means devoid of interest; and as little  has hitherto been published about the Birds of Guernsey and the  neighbouring islands, except in a few occasional papers published by  Miss C.B. Carey, Mr. Harvie Browne, myself, and a few others, in the  pages of the 'Zoologist,' I make no excuse for publishing this list of  the birds, which, as an occasional visitor to the Channel Islands for  now some thirty years, have in some way been brought to my notice as  occurring in these Islands either as residents, migrants, or occasional  visitants.    Channel Island specimens of several of the rarer birds mentioned, as  well as of the commoner ones, are in my own collection; and others I  have seen either in the flesh or only recently skinned in the  bird-stuffers' shops. For a few, of course, I have been obliged to rely  on the evidence of others; some of these may appear, perhaps, rather  questionable,--as, for instance, the Osprey,--but I have always given  what evidence I have been able to collect in each case; and where  evidence of the occurrence was altogether wanting, I have thought it  better to omit all mention of the bird, though its occasional occurrence  may seem possible.    I have confined myself in this list to the Birds of Guernsey and the  neighbouring islands--Sark, Alderney, Jethou and Herm; in fact to the  islands included in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. I have done this as I  have had no opportunity of personally studying the birds of Jersey, only  having been in that island once some years ago, and then only for a  short time, and not because I think a notice of the birds of Jersey  would have been devoid of interest, though whether it would have added  many to my list maybe doubtful. Professor Ansted's list, included in his  large and very interesting work on the Channel Islands, is hitherto the  only attempt at a regular list of the Birds of the Channel Islands; but  as he, though great as a geologist, is no ornithologist, he was obliged  to rely in a great measure on information received from others, and this  apparently was not always very reliable, and he does not appear to have  taken much trouble to sift the evidence given to him. Professor Ansted  himself states that his list is necessarily imperfect, as he received  little or no information from some of the Islands; in fact, Guernsey and  Sark appear to be the only two from which much information had been  received. This is to be regretted, as it has made the notice of the  distribution of the various birds through the Islands, which he has  denoted by the letters _a, e, i, o, u_[1] appended to the name of each  bird, necessarily faulty. The ornithological notes, however, supplied by  Mr. Gallienne are of considerable interest, and are generally pretty  reliable. It is rather remarkable, however, that Professor Ansted has  not always paid attention to these notes in marking the distribution of  the birds through the various Islands.    No doubt many of the birds included in Professor Ansted's list were  included merely on the authority of specimens in the museum of the  Mechanics' Institute, which at one time was a pretty good one; and had  sufficient care been taken to label the various specimens correctly as  to place and date, especially distinguishing local specimens from  foreign ones, of which there were a good many, would have been a very  interesting and useful local museum; as it is, the interest of this  museum is considerably deteriorated. Some of the birds in the museum are  confessedly foreign, having been brought from various parts of the world  by Guernsey men, who when abroad remembered the museum in their own  Island, and brought home specimens for it. Others, as Mr. Gallienne, who  during his life took much interest in the museum, himself told me had  been purchased from various bird-stuffers, especially from one in  Jersey; and no questions were asked as to whether the specimens bought  were local or set-up from skins obtained from the Continent or England.  Amongst those so obtained may probably be classed the Blue-throated  Warblers, included in Professor Ansted's list and marked as Jersey  (these Mr. Gallienne himself told me he believed to be Continental and  not genuine Channel Island specimens), the Great Sedge Warbler, the  Meadow Bunting, the Green Woodpecker, and perhaps a few others.    This museum, partly from want of interest being taken in it and partly  from want of money, has never had a very good room, and has been  shuffled and moved about from one place to another, and consequently  several birds really valuable, as they could be proved to be genuine  Channel Island specimens, have been lost and destroyed; in fact, had it  not been for the care and energy of Miss C.B. Carey, who took great  pains to preserve what she found remaining of the collection, and place  it in some sort of order, distinguishing by a different coloured label  those specimens which could be proved to be Channel Island (in doing  this she worked very hard, and received very little thanks or  encouragement, but on the contrary met with a considerable amount of  genuine obstructiveness), the whole of the specimens in the museum would  undoubtedly have been lost; as it is, a good many valuable local  specimens--valuable as being still capable of being proved to be genuine  Channel Island specimens--have been preserved, and a good nucleus kept  for the foundation of a new museum, should interest in the subject  revive and the local authorities be disposed to assist in its formation.  In my notices of each bird I have mentioned whether there is a specimen  in the museum, and also whether it is included in Professor Ansted's  list, and if so in which of the Islands he has marked it as occurring.    No doubt the Ornithology of the Channel Islands, as is the case in many  counties of England, has been considerably changed by drainage works,  improved cultivation, and road-making; much alteration of this sort I  can see has taken place during the thirty years which I have known the  Islands as an occasional visitor. But Mr. MacCulloch, who has been  resident in the Islands for a much longer period--in fact, he has told  me nearly double--has very kindly supplied me with the following very  interesting note on the various changes which have taken place in  Guernsey during the long period he has lived in that island; he says, \"I  can well recollect the cutting of most of the main roads, and the  improvement, still going on, of the smaller ones. It was about the  beginning of this century that the works for reclaiming the Braye du  Valle were undertaken; before that time the Clos du Valle[2] was  separated from the mainland by an arm of the sea, left dry at low water,  extending from St. Samson's to the Vale Church. This was bordered by  salt marshes only, covered occasionally at spring tides by the sea, some  of which extended pretty far inland. The meadows adjoining were very  imperfectly drained, as indeed some still are, and covered with reeds  and rushes, forming excellent shelter for many species of aquatic birds.  Now, as you know, by far the greater part of the land is well cultivated  and thickly covered with habitations. The old roads were everywhere  enclosed between high hedges, on which were planted rows of elms; and  the same kind of hedge divided the fields and tenements. Every house,  too, in those days had its orchard, cider being then universally drunk;  and the hill-sides and cliffs were covered with furze brakes, as in all  country houses they baked their own bread and required the furze for  fuel. Now all that is changed. The meadows are drained and planted with  brocoli for the early London market, to be replaced by a crop of  potatoes at the end of the summer. The trees are cut down to let in the  sun. Since the people have taken to gin-drinking, cider is out of favour  and the orchards destroyed. The hedges are levelled to gain a few  perches of ground, and replaced in many places by stone walls; the furze  brakes rooted up, and the whole aspect and nature of the country  changed. Is it to be wondered at that those kinds of birds that love  shelter and quiet have deserted us? You know, too, how every bird--from  the Wren to the Eagle--is popped at as soon as it shows itself, in  places where there are no game laws and every man allowed to carry a  gun.\"    This interesting description of the changes--agricultural and  otherwise--which have taken place in the Islands, especially Guernsey,  during the last fifty or sixty years (for which I have to offer Mr.  MacCulloch my best thanks), gives a very good general idea of many of  the alterations that have taken place in the face of the country during  the period above mentioned; but does not by any means exhaust them, as  no mention is made of the immense increase of orchard-houses in all  parts of Guernsey, which has been so great that I may fairly say that  within the last few years miles of glasshouses have been built in  Guernsey alone: these have been built mostly for the purpose of growing  grapes for the London market. These orchard-houses have, to a certain  extent, taken the place of ordinary orchards and gardens, which have  been rooted up and destroyed to "]]]
