Bibliography        I    INTERESTS, OPPORTUNITY AND MATERIALS      Two strong interests come to expression in this report: the one in the  study of the adaptive or ideational behavior of the monkeys and the  apes; and the other in adequate and permanent provision for the thorough  study of all aspects of the lives of these animals. The values of these  interests and of the tasks which they have led me to undertake are so  widely recognized by biologists that I need not pause to justify or  define them. I shall, instead, attempt to make a contribution of fact on  the score of each interest.    While recognizing that the task of prospecting for an anthropoid or  primate station may in its outcome prove incomparably more important for  the biological and sociological sciences and for human welfare than my  experimental study of ideational behavior, I give the latter first place  in this report, reserving for the concluding section an account of the  situation regarding our knowledge of the monkeys, apes, and other  primates, and a description of a plan and program for the thorough-going  and long continued study of these organisms in a permanent station or  research institute.    In 1915, a long desired opportunity came to me to devote myself  undividedly to tasks which I have designated above as \"prospecting\" for  an anthropoid station and experimenting with monkeys and apes. First of  all, the interruption of my academic duties by sabbatical leave gave me  free time. But in addition to this freedom for research, I needed  animals and equipment. These, too, happily, were most satisfactorily  provided, as I shall now describe.    When in 1913, while already myself engaged in seeking the establishment  of an anthropoid station, I heard of the founding of such an institution  at Orotava, Tenerife, the Canary Islands, I immediately made inquiries  of the founder of the station, Doctor Max Rothmann of Berlin, concerning  his plans (Rothmann, 1912).[1] As a result of our correspondence, I was  invited to visit and make use of the facilities of the Orotava station  and to consider with its founder the possibility of cooeperative work  instead of the establishing of an American station. This invitation I  gratefully accepted with the expectation of spending the greater part of  the year 1915 on the island of Tenerife. But the outbreak of the war  rendered my plan impracticable, while at the same time destroying all  reasonable ground for hope of profitable cooeperation with the Germans in  the study of the anthropoids. In August, 1915, Doctor Rothmann died.  Presumably, the station still exists at Orotava in the interests of  certain psychological and physiological research. So far as I know,  there are as yet no published reports of studies made at this station.  It seems from every point of view desirable that American psychologists  should, without regard to this initial attempt of the Germans to provide  for anthropoid research, further the establishment of a well equipped  American station for the study not only of the anthropoid apes but of  all of the lower primates.    [Footnote 1: See bibliography at end of report.]    In the early months of the war while I was making every effort to obtain  reliable information concerning conditions in the Canary Islands, I  received an urgent invitation from my friend and former student, Doctor  G. V. Hamilton, to make use of his collection of animals and laboratory  at Montecito, California, during my leave of absence from Harvard. This  invitation I most gladly accepted, and in February, 1915, I established  myself in Santa Barbara, in convenient proximity to Doctor Hamilton's  private laboratory where for more than six months I was able to work  uninterruptedly under nearly ideal conditions.    Doctor Hamilton without reserve placed at my disposal his entire  collection of animals, laboratory, and equipment, provided innumerable  conveniences for my work, and in addition, bore the entire expense of my  investigation. I cannot adequately thank him for his kindness nor make  satisfactory acknowledgment here of his generous aid. Thanks to his  sympathetic interest and to the courtesy of the McCormick family on  whose estate the laboratory was located, my work was done under wholly  delightful conditions, and with assistance from Ramon Jimenez and Frank  Van Den Bergh, Jr., which was invaluable. The former aided me most  intelligently in the care of the animals and the construction of  apparatus; and the latter, especially, was of very real service in  connection with many of my experiments.    The collection of animals which Doctor Hamilton placed at my disposal  consisted of ten monkeys and one orang utan. The monkeys represented  either _Pithecus rhesus_ Audebert (_Macacus rhesus_), _Pithecus irus_ F.  Cuvier (_Macacus cynomolgos_), or the hybrid of these two species  (Elliot, 1913). There were two eunuchs, five males, and three females.  All were thoroughly acclimated, having lived in Montecito either from  birth or for several years. The orang utan was a young specimen of  _Pongo pygmaeus_ Hoppius obtained from a San Francisco dealer in  October, 1914 for my use. His age at that time, as judged by his size  and the presence of milk teeth, was not more than five years. So far as  I could discover, he was a perfectly normal, healthy, and active  individual. On June 10, 1915, his weight was thirty-four pounds, his  height thirty-two inches, and his chest girt twenty-three inches. On  August 18 of the same year, the three measurements were thirty-six and  one-half pounds, thirty-three inches, and twenty-five inches.    For the major portion of my experimental work, only three of the eleven  animals were used. A growing male, _P. rhesus_ monkey, known as Sobke; a  mature male, _P. irus_, called Skirrl; and the young orang utan, which  had been named Julius. Plates I and II present these three subjects of  my experiments in characteristically interesting attitudes. In plate I,  figure 1, Julius appears immediately behind the laboratory seated on a  rock, against a background of live oaks. This figure gives one an  excellent idea of the immediate environment of the laboratory. Figure 2  of the same plate is a portrait of Julius taken in the latter part of  August. By reason of the heavy growth of hair, he appeared considerably  older as well as larger at this time than when the photograph for figure  1 was taken. In plate II, figure 3, Julius is shown in the woods in the  attitude of reaching for a banana, while in figure 4 of the same plate  he is represented as walking upright in one of the cages.    Likenesses of Sobke are presented in figures 5 and 6 of plate II. In the  latter of these figures he is shown stretching his mouth, apparently  yawning but actually preparing for an attack on another monkey behind  the wire screen. Figure 7 of this plate indicates Skirrl in an  interesting attitude of attention and with an obvious lack of  self-consciousness. The same monkey is represented again in figures 8  and 9 of plate II, this time in the act of using hammer and saw.

All of the animals except the orang utan had been used more or less for  experiments on behavior by Doctor Hamilton, but this prior work in no  way interfered with my own investigation. Doctor Hamilton has  accumulated a large mass of the most valuable and interesting  observations on the behavior of monkeys, and he more thoroughly  understands them than any other observer of whom I have knowledge. Much  to my regret and embarrassment in connection with the present report, he  has thus far published only a small portion of his data (Hamilton, 1911,  1914). In his most recent paper on \"A study of sexual tendencies in  monkeys and baboons,\" he has given important information concerning  several of the monkeys which I have observed. For the convenience of  readers who may make use of both his reports and mine, I am designating  the animals by the names previously given them by Hamilton.

[Illustration: Anne Hathaway's Cottage.]      This is another of Mr. Rider's beautiful \"Views to Illustrate the Life of  SHAKSPEARE,\"[1]--it being the exterior of the cottage in which the poet's  wife (whose maiden name was _Hathaway_) is said to have resided with her  parents, in the village of Shottery, about a mile from Stratford-upon-Avon.        [1] Merridew and Rider, Warwick and Leamington, and Goodhugh,      Oxford-street, London.    Neither the exterior nor interior of this humble abode, says Mr. Rider,  appears to have been subjected to any renovating process; and as there  exists no reasonable ground for distrusting the fact of its having been  the abode of _Anne Hathaway_, previous to her marriage with Shakspeare, it  must ever be regarded as one of the most interesting relics connected with  his history. The occupier of the cottage in July, 1827, was an old woman,  the widow of John Hathaway Taylor, whose mother was a Hathaway, and the  last of the family of that name.    [Illustration]    The widow Taylor showed Mr. Rider the old carved bedstead, mentioned by  \"Ireland,\" and assured him she perfectly recollected his purchasing of her  mother-in-law the piece of furniture which had always been known by the  designation of _Shakspeare's Courting-Chair_. From the wood-cut of this  chair, given by Ireland in his \"Views on the Avon,\" Mr. Rider has been  enabled to introduce it in his representation of the interior of the  cottage.    We have accordingly detached it for a vignette, and as the throne where                            The lover,    Sighing like furnace, with woeful ballad    Made to his mistress' eye-brow--    it will probably be acceptable to the most enthusiastic of Shakspeare's  admirers; not doubting that scores of our lady-friends will provide  themselves with a chair of the same construction, if they would insure the  fervour and sincerity of the poet's love, or by association become more  susceptible of his inspirations of the master-passion of humanity.           *       *       *       *       *        THE NOVELIST.    ANTONELLI;    _(A Tale, from the German of Goethe.)_      When I was in Italy, Antonelli, an opera-singer, was the favourite of the  Neapolitan public. Her youth, beauty, and talents insured her applause on  the stage; nor was she deficient in any quality that could render her  agreeable to a small circle of friends. She was not indifferent either  to love or praise; but her discretion was such as to enable her to enjoy  both with becoming dignity. Every young man of rank or fortune in Naples,  was eager to be numbered among her suitors; few however, met with a  favourable reception; and though she was, in the choice of her lovers,  directed chiefly by her eyes and her heart, she displayed on all  occasions a firmness, and stability of character, that never failed to  engage even such as were indifferent to her favours. I had frequent  opportunities of seeing her, being on terms of the closest intimacy with  one of her favoured admirers.    Several years were now elapsed, and she had become acquainted with a  number of gentlemen, many of whom had rendered themselves disgusting by  the extreme levity and fickleness of their manners. She had repeatedly  observed young gentlemen, whose professions of constancy and attachment  would persuade their mistress of the impossibility of their ever  deserting her, withhold their protection in those very cases where it  was most needed; or, what is still worse, incited by the temptation of  ridding themselves of a troublesome connexion, she had known them give  advice which has entailed misery and ruin.    Her acquaintance hitherto had been of such a nature as to leave her mind  inactive. She now began to feel a desire, to which she had before been a  stranger. She wished to possess a friend, to whom she might communicate  her most secret thoughts, and happily, just at that time, she found one  among those who surrounded her, possessed of every requisite quality,  and who seemed, in every respect, worthy of her confidence.    This gentleman was by birth a Genoese, and resided at Naples, for the  purpose of transacting some commercial business of great importance, for  the house with which he was connected. In possession of good parts, he had,  in addition received a very finished education. His knowledge was  extensive; and no less care had been bestowed on his body, than on his  mind. He was inspired with the commercial spirit natural to his countrymen,  and considered mercantile affairs on a grand scale. His situation was,  however, not the most enviable; his house had unfortunately been drawn  into hazardous speculations, which were afterwards attended with expensive  law-suits. The state of his affairs grew daily more intricate, and the  uneasiness thereby produced gave him an air of seriousness, which in the  present case was not to his disadvantage; for it encouraged our young  heroine to seek his friendship, rightly judging, that he himself stood in  need of a friend.    Hitherto, he had seen her only occasionally, and at places of public  resort; she now, on his first request, granted him access to her house;  she even invited him very pressingly, and he was not remiss in obeying the  invitation.    She lost no time in making him acquainted with her wishes, and the  confidence she reposed in him. He was surprised, and rejoiced at the  proposal. She was urgent in the request that he might always remain her  friend, and never shade that sacred name with the ambiguous claims of a  lover. She made him acquainted with some difficulties which then perplexed  her, and on which his experience would enable him to give the best advice,  and propose the most speedy means for her relief. In return for this  confidence, he did not hesitate to disclose to her his own situation; and  her endeavours to soothe and console him were, in reality, not without a  beneficial consequence, as they served to put him in that state of mind,  so necessary for acting with deliberation and effect. Thus a friendship  was in a short time cemented, founded on the most exalted esteem, and on  the consciousness that each was necessary to the well-being of the other.    It happens but too often, that we make agreements without considering  whether it is in our power to fulfil their conditions. He had promised to  be only her friend, and not to think of her as a mistress; and yet he  could not deny that he was mortified and disgusted with the sight of any  other visiter. His ill-humour was particularly excited by hearing her, in  a jesting manner, enumerate the good or bad qualities of some favourite,  and after having shown much good sense in pointing out his blemishes,  neglect her friend, and prefer his company that very evening.    It happened soon after that the heart of the fair was disengaged. Her  friend was rejoiced at the discovery, and represented to her, that he was  entitled to her affection before all others. She gave ear to his petition,  when she found resistance was vain. \"I fear,\" said she, \"that I am parting  with the most valuable possession on earth--a friend, and that I shall get  nothing in return but a lover.\" Her suspicions were well founded: he had  not enjoyed his double capacity long, when he showed a degree of  peevishness, of which he had before thought himself incapable; as a friend  he demanded her esteem; as a lover he claimed her undivided affection; and  as a man of sense and education, he expected rational and pleasing  conversation. These complicated claims, however, ill accorded with the  sprightly disposition of Antonelli; she could consent to no sacrifices,  and was unwilling to grant exclusive rights. She therefore endeavoured in  a delicate manner to shorten his visits, to see him less frequently, and  intimated that she would upon no consideration whatever give up her  freedom.    As soon as he remarked this new treatment, his misery was beyond endurance,  and unfortunately, this was not the only mischance that befel him; his  mercantile affairs assumed a very doubtful appearance; besides this, a  view of his past life called forth many mortifying reflections; he had  from his earliest youth looked upon his fortune as inexhaustible, his  business often lay neglected, while engaged in long and expensive travels,  endeavouring to make a figure in the fashionable world, far above his  birth and fortune. The lawsuits, which were now his only hope, proceeded  slowly, and were connected with a vast expense. These required his  presence in Palermo several times; and while absent on his last journey,  Antonelli made arrangements calculated, by degrees, to banish him entirely  from her house. On his return, he found she had taken another house at a  considerable distance from his own; the Marquess de S., who, at that time,  had great influence on plays and public diversions, visited her daily, and  to all appearance, with great familiarity. This mortified him severely,  and a serious illness was the consequence. When the news of his sickness  reached his friend, she hastened to him, was anxious to see him  comfortable, and discovering that he was in great pecuniary difficulties,  on going away she left him a sum of money sufficient to relieve his wants.    Her friend had once presumed to encroach on her freedom; this attempt was  with her an unpardonable offence, and the discovery of his having acted so"]]]
