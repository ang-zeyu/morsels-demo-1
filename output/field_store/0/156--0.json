The Heroic Mythology of the North      Sigemund the Waelsing and Fitela, Aetla, Eormanric the Goth and Gifica  of Burgundy, Ongendtheow and Theodric, Heorrenda and the Heodenings,  and Weland the Smith: all these heroes of Germanic legend were known  to the writers of our earliest English literature. But in most cases  the only evidence of this knowledge is a word, a name, here and there,  with no hint of the story attached. For circumstances directed the  poetical gifts of the Saxons in England towards legends of the saints  and Biblical paraphrase, away from the native heroes of the race;  while later events completed the exclusion of Germanic legend from our  literature, by substituting French and Celtic romance. Nevertheless,  these few brief references in _Beowulf_ and in the small group of  heathen English relics give us the right to a peculiar interest in the  hero-poems of the Edda. In studying these heroic poems, therefore,  we are confronted by problems entirely different in character from  those which have to be considered in connexion with the mythical  texts. Those are in the main the product of one, the Northern,  branch of the Germanic race, as we have seen (No. 12 of this series),  and the chief question to be determined is whether they represent,  however altered in form, a mythology common to all the Germans, and  as such necessarily early; or whether they are in substance, as well  as in form, a specific creation of the Scandinavians, and therefore  late and secondary. The heroic poems of the Edda, on the contrary,  with the exception of the Helgi cycle, have very close analogues in  the literatures of the other great branches of the Germanic race,  and these we are able to compare with the Northern versions.    The Edda contains poems belonging to the following heroic cycles:    (_a_) _Weland the Smith_.--Anglo-Saxon literature has several  references to this cycle, which must have been a very popular one;  and there is also a late Continental German version preserved in  an Icelandic translation. But the poem in the Edda is the oldest  connected form of the story.    (_b_) _Sigurd and the Nibelungs_.--Again the oldest reference is in  Anglo-Saxon.  There are two well-known Continental German versions  in the _Nibelungen Lied_ and the late Icelandic _Thidreks Saga_,  but the Edda, on the whole, has preserved an earlier form of the  legend. With it is loosely connected    (_c_) _The Ermanric Cycle_.--The oldest references to this are in Latin  and Anglo-Saxon. The Continental German version in the _Thidreks Saga_  is late, and, like that in the Edda, contaminated with the Sigurd  story, with which it had originally nothing to do.    (_d_) _Helgi_.--This cycle, at least in its present form, is peculiar  to the Scandinavian North.    All the above-named poems are contained in Codex Regius of the Elder  Edda. From other sources we may add other poems which are Eddic, not  Skaldic, in style, in which other heroic cycles are represented. The  great majority of the poems deal with the favourite story of the  Volsungs, which threatens to swamp all the rest; for one hero after  another, Burgundian, Hun, Goth, was absorbed into it. The poems in this  part of the MS. differ far more widely in date and style than do the  mythological ones; many of the Volsung-lays are comparatively late, and  lack the fine simplicity which characterises the older popular poetry.    _Voelund_.--The lay of Voelund, the wonderful smith, the Weland of  the Old English poems and the only Germanic hero who survived for  any considerable time in English popular tradition, stands alone in  its cycle, and is the first heroic poem in the MS. It is in a very  fragmentary state, some of the deficiencies being supplied by short  pieces of prose. There are two motives in the story: the Swan-maids,  and the Vengeance of the Captive Smith. Three brothers, Slagfinn,  Egil and Voelund, sons of the Finnish King, while out hunting built  themselves a house by the lake in Wolfsdale. There, early one  morning, they saw three Valkyries spinning, their swancoats lying  beside them. The brothers took them home; but after seven years the  swan-maidens, wearied of their life, flew away to battle, and did  not return.    \"Seven years they stayed there, but in the eighth longing seized  them, and in the ninth need parted them.\" Egil and Slagfinn went to  seek their wives, but Voelund stayed where he was and worked at his  forge. There Nithud, King of Sweden, took him captive:    \"Men went by night in studded mailcoats; their shields shone by  the waning moon. They dismounted from the saddle at the hall-gable,  and went in along the hall. They saw rings strung on bast which the  hero owned, seven hundred in all; they took them off and put, them on  again, all but one. The keen-eyed archer Voelund came in from hunting,  from a far road.... He sat on a bear-skin and counted his rings, and  the prince of the elves missed one; he thought Hlodve's daughter,  the fairy-maid, had come back. He sat so long that he fell asleep,  and awoke powerless: heavy bonds were on his hands, and fetters  clasped on his feet.\"    They took him away and imprisoned him, ham-strung, on an island to  forge treasures for his captors. Then Voelund planned vengeance:    \"'I see on Nithud's girdle the sword which I knew keenest and best,  and which I forged with all my skill. The glittering blade is taken  from me for ever; I shall not see it borne to Voelund's smithy. Now  Boedvild wears my bride's red ring; I expect no atonement.' He sat  and slept not, but struck with his hammer.\"    Nithud's children came to see him in his smithy: the two boys he slew,  and made drinking-cups for Nithud from their skulls; and the daughter  Boedvild he beguiled, and having made himself wings he rose into the  air and left her weeping for her lover and Nithud mourning his sons.    In the Old English poems allusion is made only to the second part  of the story; there is no reference to the legend of the enchanted  brides, which is indeed distinct in origin, being identical with  the common tale of the fairy wife who is obliged to return to animal  shape through some breach of agreement by her mortal husband. This  incident of the compact (_i.e._, to hide the swan-coat, to refrain  from asking the wife's name, or whatever it may have been) has been  lost in the Voelund tale. The Continental version is told in the late  Icelandic _Thidreks Saga_, where it is brought into connexion with  the Volsung story; in this the story of the second brother, Egil the  archer, is also given, and its antiquity is supported by the pictures  on the Anglo-Saxon carved whale-bone box known as the Franks Casket,  dated by Professor Napier at about 700 A.D. The adventures of the  third brother, Slagfinn, have not survived. The Anglo-Saxon gives  Voelund and Boedvild a son, Widia or Wudga, the Wittich who appears as  a follower of Dietrich's in the Continental German sources.    _The Volsungs_.--No story better illustrates the growth of heroic  legend than the Volsung cycle. It is composite, four or five mythical  motives combining to form the nucleus; and as it took possession  more and more strongly of the imagination of the early Germans, and  still more of the Scandinavians, other heroic cycles were brought  into dependence on it. None of the Eddic poems on the subject are  quite equal in poetic value to the Helgi lays; many are fragmentary,  several late, and only one attempts a review of the whole story. The  outline is as follows: Sigurd the Volsung, son of Sigmund and brother  of Sinfjoetli, slays the dragon who guards the Nibelungs' hoard on  the Glittering Heath, and thus inherits the curse which accompanies  the treasure; he finds and wakens Brynhild the Valkyrie, lying in  an enchanted sleep guarded by a ring of fire, loves her and plights  troth with her; Grimhild, wife of the Burgundian Giuki, by enchantment  causes him to forget the Valkyrie, to love her own daughter Gudrun,  and, since he alone can cross the fire, to win Brynhild for her son  Gunnar. After the marriage, Brynhild discovers the trick, and incites  her husband and his brothers to kill Sigurd.    The series begins with a prose piece on the Death of Sinfjoetli,  which says that after Sinfjoetli, son of Sigmund, Volsung's son (which  should be Valsi's son, Volsung being a tribal, not a personal, name),  had been poisoned by his stepmother Borghild, Sigmund married Hjoerdis,  Eylimi's daughter, had a son Sigurd, and fell in battle against the  race of Hunding. Sigmund, as in all other Norse sources, is said to be  king in Frankland, which, like the Niderlant of the _Nibelungen Lied_,  means the low lands on the Rhine. The scene of the story is always  near that river: Sigurd was slain by the Rhine, and the treasure of  the Rhine is quoted as proverbial in the Voelund lay.    _Gripisspa_ (the Prophecy of Gripi), which follows, is appropriately  placed first of the Volsung poems, since it gives a summary of the  whole story. Sigurd rides to see his mother's brother, Gripi, the  wisest of men, to ask about his destiny, and the soothsayer prophesies  his adventures and early death. This poem makes clear some original  features of the legend which are obscured elsewhere, especially in the  Gudrun set; Grimhild's treachery, and Sigurd's unintentional"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#1)"],[1,"Note: The author, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford (1837-1916), Lord        Redesdale, was in the British Foreign Service as a young man.

Formerly Second Secretary to the British Legation in Japan    With Illustrations Drawn and Cut on Wood by Japanese Artists    1910              [Illustration: THE RONINS INVITE KOTSUKE NO SUKE TO PERFORM  HARA-KIRI.]          PREFACE    In the Introduction to the story of the Forty-seven Ronins, I have  said almost as much as is needful by way of preface to my stories.    Those of my readers who are most capable of pointing out the many  shortcomings and faults of my work, will also be the most indulgent  towards me; for any one who has been in Japan, and studied Japanese,  knows the great difficulties by which the learner is beset.    For the illustrations, at least, I feel that I need make no apology.  Drawn, in the first instance, by one Odake, an artist in my employ,  they were cut on wood by a famous wood-engraver at Yedo, and are  therefore genuine specimens of Japanese art. Messrs. Dalziel, on  examining the wood blocks, pointed out to me, as an interesting fact,  that the lines are cut with the grain of the wood, after the manner of  Albert Duerer and some of the old German masters,--a process which has  been abandoned by modern European wood-engravers.    It will be noticed that very little allusion is made in these Tales to  the Emperor and his Court. Although I searched diligently, I was able  to find no story in which they played a conspicuous part.    Another class to which no allusion is made is that of the Goshi. The  Goshi are a kind of yeomen, or bonnet-lairds, as they would be called  over the border, living on their own land, and owning no allegiance to  any feudal lord. Their rank is inferior to that of the Samurai, or men  of the military class, between whom and the peasantry they hold a  middle place. Like the Samurai, they wear two swords, and are in many  cases prosperous and wealthy men claiming a descent more ancient than  that of many of the feudal Princes. A large number of them are  enrolled among the Emperor's body-guard; and these have played a  conspicuous part in the recent political changes in Japan, as the most  conservative and anti-foreign element in the nation.    With these exceptions, I think that all classes are fairly  represented in my stories.    The feudal system has passed away like a dissolving view before the  eyes of those who have lived in Japan during the last few years. But  when they arrived there it was in full force, and there is not an  incident narrated in the following pages, however strange it may  appear to Europeans, for the possibility and probability of which  those most competent to judge will not vouch. Nor, as many a recent  event can prove, have heroism, chivalry, and devotion gone out of the  land altogether. We may deplore and inveigh against the Yamato  Damashi, or Spirit of Old Japan, which still breathes in the soul of  the Samurai, but we cannot withhold our admiration from the  self-sacrifices which men will still make for the love of their  country.    The first two of the Tales have already appeared in the _Fortnightly  Review,_ and two of the Sermons, with a portion of the Appendix on the  subject of the Hara-Kiri, in the pages of the _Cornhill Magazine_. I  have to thank the editors of those periodicals for permission to  reprint them here.

Of the inner life of the  Japanese the world at large knows but little: their religion, their  superstitions, their ways of thought, the hidden springs by which they  move--all these are as yet mysteries. Nor is this to be wondered at.  The first Western men who came in contact with Japan--I am speaking  not of the old Dutch and Portuguese traders and priests, but of the  diplomatists and merchants of eleven years ago--met with a cold  reception. Above all things, the native Government threw obstacles in  the way of any inquiry into their language, literature, and history.  The fact was that the Tycoon's Government--with whom alone, so long as  the Mikado remained in seclusion in his sacred capital at Kioto, any  relations were maintained--knew that the Imperial purple with which  they sought to invest their chief must quickly fade before the strong  sunlight which would be brought upon it so soon as there should be  European linguists capable of examining their books and records. No  opportunity was lost of throwing dust in the eyes of the new-comers,  whom, even in the most trifling details, it was the official policy to  lead astray. Now, however, there is no cause for concealment; the _Roi  Faineant_ has shaken off his sloth, and his _Maire du Palais_,  together, and an intelligible Government, which need not fear scrutiny  from abroad, is the result: the records of the country being but so  many proofs of the Mikado's title to power, there is no reason for  keeping up any show of mystery. The path of inquiry is open to all;  and although there is yet much to be learnt, some knowledge has been  attained, in which it may interest those who stay at home to share.    The recent revolution in Japan has wrought changes social as well as  political; and it may be that when, in addition to the advance which  has already been made, railways and telegraphs shall have connected  the principal points of the Land of Sunrise, the old Japanese, such  as he was and had been for centuries when we found him eleven short  years ago, will have become extinct. It has appeared to me that no  better means could be chosen of preserving a record of a curious and  fast disappearing civilization than the translation of some of the  most interesting national legends and histories, together with other  specimens of literature bearing upon the same subject. Thus the  Japanese may tell their own tale, their translator only adding here  and there a few words of heading or tag to a chapter, where an  explanation or amplification may seem necessary. I fear that the long  and hard names will often make my tales tedious reading, but I believe  that those who will bear with the difficulty will learn more of the  character of the Japanese people than by skimming over descriptions of  travel and adventure, however brilliant. The lord and his retainer,  the warrior and the priest, the humble artisan and the despised Eta or  pariah, each in his turn will become a leading character in my budget  of stories; and it is out of the mouths of these personages that I  hope to show forth a tolerably complete picture of Japanese society.
