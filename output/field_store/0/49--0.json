BLAIR, J.E. BROWN, J.N. DOLPH,               G.G. VEST, AND GEO. F. HOAR.                           WASHINGTON.                          1887.           *       *       *       *       *    _Wednesday, December 8, 1886._    On the joint resolution (S.R. 5) proposing an amendment to the  Constitution of the United States extending the right of suffrage to  women.    Mr. BLAIR said:    Mr. PRESIDENT: I ask the Senate to proceed to the consideration of  Order of Business 122, being the joint resolution (S.R. 5) proposing  an amendment to the Constitution of the United States extending the  right of suffrage to women.    The motion was agreed to.    The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_. The joint resolution will be read.    The Chief Clerk read as follows:        Joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the      United States extending the right of suffrage to women.        _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United      States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House      concurring therein)_, That the following article be proposed to      the Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the      Constitution of the United States; which, when ratified by      three-fourths of the said Legislatures, shall be valid as part of      said Constitution, namely:        ARTICLE--.        SECTION 1. The rights of citizens of the United States to vote      shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any      State on account of sex.        SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation,      to enforce the provisions of this article.    Mr. BLAIR. Mr. President, the question before the Senate is this:  Shall a joint resolution providing for an amendment of the national  Constitution, so that the right of citizens of the United States to  vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by  any State, on account of sex, and that Congress shall have power to  enforce the article, be submitted to the Legislatures of the several  States for ratification or rejection?    The answer to this question does not depend necessarily upon the  reply to that other question, whether women ought to be permitted  to exercise the right or privilege of suffrage as do men. The  Legislatures of the several States must decide this in ratifying or  rejecting the proposed amendment.    Upon solemn occasions concerning grave public affairs, and when large  numbers of the citizens of the country desire to test the sentiments  of the people upon an amendment of the organic law in the manner  provided to be done by the provisions of that law, it may well become  the duty of Congress to submit the proposition to the amending power,  which is the same as that which created the original instrument  itself--the people of the several States.    It can hardly be claimed that two-thirds of each branch of Congress  must necessarily be convinced that the Constitution should be amended  as proposed in the joint resolution to be submitted before it has  discretion to submit the same to the judgment of the States. Any  citizen has the right to petition or, through his representative, to  bring in his bill for redress of grievances, or to promote the public  good by legislation; and it can hardly be maintained that, before  any citizen or large body of citizens shall have the privilege of  introducing a bill to the great legislative tribunal, which alone has  primary jurisdiction of the organic law and power to amend or change  it, the Congress, which under the Constitution is simply the moving or  initiating power, must by a two-thirds vote approve the proposition  at issue before its discussion shall be permitted in the forum of the  States. To hold such a doctrine would be contrary to all our ideas of  free discussion, and to lock up the institutions and the interests of  a great and progressive people in fetters of brass.    It is only essential that two-thirds of each House of the Congress  shall deem it necessary for the public good, that the amendment  be proposed to the States for their action. But two-thirds of the  Congress will hardly consider it \"necessary\" to submit a joint  resolution proposing an amendment of the National Constitution to  the States for consideration, unless the subject matter be of grave  importance, with strong reasons in its favor, and a large support  already developed among the people themselves.    If there be any principle upon which our form of government is  founded, and wherein it is different from aristocracies, monarchies,  and despotisms, that principle is this:    Every human being of mature powers, not disqualified by ignorance,  vice or crime, is the equal of and is entitled to all the rights and  privileges which belong to any other such human being under the law.    The independence, equality, and dignity of all human souls is the  fundamental assertion of those who believe in what we call human  freedom. This principle will hardly be denied by any one, even by  those who oppose the adoption of the resolution. But we are informed  that infants, idiots, and women are represented by men. This cannot  reasonably be claimed unless it be first shown that the consent of  these classes has been given to such representation, or that they  lack the capacity to consent. But the exclusion of these classes from  participation in the Government deprives them of the power of assent  to representation even when they possess the requisite ability; and to  say there can be representation which does not presuppose consent  or authority on the part of the principal who is represented is to  confound all reason and to assert in substance that all actual power,  whether despotic or otherwise, is representative, and therefore free.  In this sense the Czar represents his whole people, just as voting men  represent women who do not vote at all.    True it is that the voting men, by excluding women and other classes  from the suffrage, by that act charge themselves with the trust of  administering justice to all, even as the monarch whose power is based  upon force is bound to rule uprightly. But if it be true that \"all  just government is founded upon the consent of the governed,\" then  the government of woman by man, without her consent, given in her  sovereign capacity, if indeed she be an intelligent creature, and  provided she be competent to exercise the power of suffrage, which is  the sovereignty, even if that government be wise and just in itself,  is a violation of natural right and an enforcement of servitude and  slavery against her on the part of man. If woman, like the infant  or the defective classes, be incapable of self-government, then  republican society may exclude her from all participation in the  enactment and enforcement of the laws under which she lives. But in  that case, like the infant and the fool and the unconsenting subject  of tyrannical forms of government, she is ruled and not represented by  man.    Thus much I desire to say in the beginning in reply to the broad  assumption of those who deny women the suffrage by saying that they  are already represented by their fathers, their husbands, their  brothers, and their sons, or to state the proposition in its only  proper form, that woman whose assent can only be given by an exercise  of sovereignty on her part is represented by man who denies and by  virtue of power and possession refuses to her the exercise of the  suffrage whereby that representation can be made valid.    The claim, then, of the minority of the committee that woman is  represented by the other sex is not well founded, and is based upon  the same assumption of power which lies at the base of all government  anti-republican in form. It can not be claimed that she is as a free  being already represented, for she can only be represented according  to her will by the exercise of her will through the suffrage itself.    As already observed, the exclusion of woman from the suffrage under  our form of government can be justified upon proof, and only upon  proof, that by reason of her sex she is incompetent to exercise that  power. This is a question of fact.    The common ground upon which all agree may be stated thus: All males  having certain qualifications are in reason and in law entitled to  vote. Those qualifications affect either the body or the mind or both.    First, the attainment of a certain age. The age in itself is not  material, but maturity of mental and moral development is material,  soundness of body in itself not being essential, and want of it alone  never working forfeiture of the right, although it may prevent its  exercise.    Age as a qualification for suffrage is by no means to be confounded  with age as a qualification for service in war. Society has well  established the distinction, and that one has no relation whatever to  the other; the one having reference to physical prowess, while the  other relates only to the mental and moral state. This is shown by the  ages fixed by law for these qualifications, that of eighteen years  being fixed as the commencement of the term of presumed fitness  for military service, and forty-five years as the period of its  termination; while the age of presumed fitness for the suffrage, which  requires no physical superiority certainly, is set at twenty-one  years, when still greater strength of body has been attained than  at the period when liability to the dangers and hardships of war  commences; and there are at least three millions more male voters in  our country than of the population"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: \"He finally found himself slugged under the ear and sent  flying over a chair.\"]          FRANK MERRIWELL  AT YALE    BY    BURT L STANDISH          1903          CONTENTS    CHAPTER    I--Trouble Brewing  II--Challenged and Hazed  III--The Blow  IV--The Fight  V--The Finish  VI--A Fresh Council  VII--A Surprise  VIII--The \"Roast\" at East Rock  IX--The Duel  X--At Morey's  XI--\"Lambda Chi!\"  XII--Freshman Against Sophomore  XIII--Jubilant Freshmen  XIV--The Rush  XV--On the Ball Field  XVI--To Break an Enemy's Wrist  XVII--Talking it Over  XVIII--Merriwell and Rattleton  XIX--Who is the Traitor?

TROUBLE BREWING.        \"Here's to good old Yale--drink it down!    Here's to good old Yale--drink it down!    Here's to good old Yale,    She's so hearty and so hale--    Drink it down! Drink it down! down! down!\"    From the open window of his rooms on York Street Frank Merriwell heard  the distant chorus of a rollicking band of students who had been having  a merry evening in town.    Frank had passed his examinations successfully and had been admitted as  a student at Yale. In order to accomplish this without taking a  preparatory course at Phillips Academy, he had found it necessary to  vigorously \"brush up\" the knowledge he had acquired at the Fardale  Military Academy which was a college preparatory school.    Professor Scotch, Frank's guardian, had been of great assistance to him,  for the professor knew just about what would be required at the  entrance examination, and he had kept the boy digging away away at the  propositions in the First Book of Euclid, had drilled him in Caesar,  caused him to spend weary hours over Virgil and the Iliad, and made him  not a little weary of his Xenophon.    As he passed without a condition, although he had been told again and  again that a course at Phillips Academy was almost an absolute  necessity, Frank was decidedly grateful to the professor.    Professor Scotch's anxiety had brought him to New Haven, where he  remained \"till the agony was over,\" as Frank expressed it. The little  man bubbled over with delight when he found his _protege_ had gone  through without a struggle.    Having secured the rooms on York Street, the professor saw Frank  comfortably settled, and then, before taking his departure, he attempted  to give the boy some wholesome advice.    \"Don't try to put on many frills here the first year,\" he said. \"You  will find that freshmen do not cut much of a figure here. It doesn't  make any difference what you have done or what you have been elsewhere,  you will have to establish a record by what you do and what you become  here. You'll find these fellows here won't care a rap if you have  discovered the North Pole or circumnavigated the globe in--er--ah--ten  days. It will be all the better for you if you do not let them know you  are rich in your own name and have traveled in South America, Africa,  Europe, and other countries. They'd think you were bragging or lying if  you mentioned it, and--\"    \"You know well enough that I am not given to boasting about myself,  professor, and so you are wasting your breath,\" said Frank, rather  resentfully.    \"Hum! ha! Don't fly off the handle--keep cool. I know you have sand, and  you're made of the right kind of stuff; but you are the greatest hand to  get into scrapes I ever saw, and a little advice won't do you any harm.  You will find that in many things you cannot do just as you would like,  so you must--\"    \"I'll get into the game all right, so don't worry. You will remember  that I did fairly well at Fardale, and you should not worry about me  while I am here.\"    \"I will not. You did well at Fardale--that's right. You were the most  popular boy in the academy; but you will find Yale is far different from  Fardale.\"    So the professor took his departure, and Frank was left to begin life at  college.    His roommate was a rollicking, headstrong, thoughtless young fellow from  Ohio. Harry Rattleton was his name, and it seemed to fit him perfectly.  He had a way of speaking rapidly and heedlessly and turning his  expressions end for end.    Frank had been able to assist Harry at examination. Harry and Frank  were seated close to each other, and when it was all over and the two  boys knew they had passed all right, Harry came to Frank, held out his  hand, and said:    \"I believe your name is Merriwell. Mine is Rattleton and I am from Ohio.  Merriwell, you are a brick, and I am much obliged to you. Let's room  together. What do you say?\"    \"I am agreeable,\" smiled Frank.    That was the way Frank found his roommate.    Harry was interested in sports and athletics, and he confided to Frank  that he was bound to make a try for both the baseball and football  teams. He had brought a set of boxing gloves, foils, and a number of  sporting pictures. The foils were crossed above the mantel and the  pictures were hung about the walls, but he insisted on putting on the  gloves with Frank before hanging them up where they would be ornamental.    \"I've taken twenty lessons, old man,\" he said, \"and I want to point you  a few shows--I mean show you a few points. We'll practice every day, and  I'll bet in less than ten weeks I'll have you so you'll be able to hold  your own with any fellow of your age and weight. Ever had the gloves  on?\"    \"A few times,\" answered Frank, with a quiet smile.    \"That's all the better. I won't have to show you how to start in. Here,  here--that hand goes on the other glove--I mean that glove goes on the  other hand. That's the way. Now we're off. Left forward foot--er, left  foot forward. Hold your guard this way. Now hit me if you can.\"    Almost like a flash of lightning Frank's glove shot out, and he caused  the glove to snap on Harry's nose.    \"Whee jiz--I mean jee whiz!\" gasped the astonished boy from Ohio.  \"You're quick! But it was an accident; you can't do it again.\"    He had scarcely uttered the words before Frank feinted and then shot in  a sharp one under Harry's uplifted guard.    \"Great Scott! You do know some tricks! I'll bet you think you can box!  Well, I'll have to drive that head out of your notion--I mean that  notion out of your head. Look out for me now! I'm coming!\"    Then Harry Rattleton sailed into Frank and met with the greatest  surprise of his life, for he found he could not touch Merriwell, and he  was beaten and hammered and battered about the room till he finally felt  himself slugged under the ear and sent flying over a chair, to land in a  heap in one corner of the room. He sat up and held his gloved hand to  his ear, which was ringing with a hundred clanging bells, while he  stared astounded at his roommate.    \"Wow!\" he gurgled. \"What have I been up against? Are you a prize  fighter in disguise?\"    That experience was enough to satisfy him that Frank Merriwell knew a  great deal more than he did about boxing.    As Frank sat by his window listening to the singing, on the evening that  this story opens, he was wondering where Harry could be, for his  roommate had been away since shortly after supper.    Frank knew the merry singers were sophomores, the malicious and  unrelenting foes of all freshmen. He would have given not a little had  he been able to join them in their songs, but he knew that was not to be  thought of for a moment.    As he continued to listen, a clear tenor voice struck into that most  beautiful of college songs when heard from a distance:      \"When the matin bell is ringing,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o,    From my rushy pallet springing,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o,    Fresh as the morning light forth I sally,    With my sickle bright thro' the valley,    To my dear one gayly singing,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o.\"    Then seven or eight strong musical young voices came in on the warbling  chorus, and the boy at the window listened enchanted and enraptured,  feeling the subtle charm of it all and blessing fortune that he was a  youth and a student at Yale.    The charm of the new life he had entered upon was strong, and it was  weaving its spell about him--the spell which makes old Yale so dear to  all who are fortunate enough to claim her as their _alma mater_. He  continued to listen, eagerly drinking in the rest of the song as it came  through the clear evening air:      \"When the day is closing o'er us,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o,    And the landscape fades before us,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o,    When our merry men quit their mowing,    And along the glen horns are blowing,    Sweetly then we'll raise the chorus,      U-ra-li-o, U-ra-li-o.\"    The warbling song died out in the distance, there was a rush of feet  outside the door, and Harry, breathless and excited, came bursting into  the room.    \"I say, old man,\" he cried, \"what do I think?\"    \"Really, I don't know,\" laughed Frank. \"What do you think?\"    \"I--I mean wh-what do you think?\" spluttered Harry.    \"Why, I think a great many things. What's up, anyway?\"    \"You know Diamond?\"    \"The fellow they call Jack?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I should say so! It was his bull pup that chewed a piece out of the leg  of my trousers. I kicked the dog downstairs, and Diamond came near  having a fit over it. He's got a peppery temper, and he was ready to  murder me. I reckon he thought I should have taken off my trousers and  given them to the dog to chew.\"    \"He's a Southerner--from Virginia. He's a dangerous chap, Frank--just as  lief eat as fight--I mean fight as eat. He's been in town to-night,  drinking beer with the boys, and he's in a mighty ugly mood. He"]]]
