EPICTETUS (BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE)    A SELECTION FROM THE DISCOURSES OF EPICTETUS    THE ENCHEIRIDION, OR MANUAL          EPICTETUS.      Very little is known of the life of Epictetus. It is said that he was a  native of Hierapolis in Phrygia, a town between the Maeander and a  branch of the Maeander named the Lycus. Hierapolis is mentioned in the  epistle of Paul to the people of Colossae (Coloss. iv., 13); from which  it has been concluded that there was a Christian church in Hierapolis in  the time of the apostle. The date of the birth of Epictetus is unknown.  The only recorded fact of his early life is that he was a slave in Rome,  and his master was Epaphroditus, a profligate freedman of the Emperor  Nero. There is a story that the master broke his slave's leg by  torturing him; but it is better to trust to the evidence of Simplicius,  the commentator on the Encheiridion, or Manual, who says that Epictetus  was weak in body and lame from an early age. It is not said how he  became a slave; but it has been asserted in modern times that the  parents sold the child. I have not, however, found any authority for  this statement.    It may be supposed that the young slave showed intelligence, for his  master sent or permitted him to attend the lectures of C. Musonius  Rufus, an eminent Stoic philosopher. It may seem strange that such a  master should have wished to have his slave made into a philosopher; but  Garnier, the author of a \"Memoire sur les Ouvrages d'Epictete,\" explains  this matter very well in a communication to Schweighaeuser. Garnier  says: \"Epictetus, born at Hierapolis of Phrygia of poor parents, was  indebted apparently for the advantages of a good education to the whim,  which was common at the end of the Republic and under the first  emperors, among the great of Rome to reckon among their numerous slaves  grammarians, poets, rhetoricians, and philosophers, in the same way as  rich financiers in these later ages have been led to form at a great  cost rich and numerous libraries. This supposition is the only one which  can explain to us how a wretched child, born as poor as Irus, had  received a good education, and how a rigid Stoic was the slave of  Epaphroditus, one of the officers of the imperial guard. For we cannot  suspect that it was through predilection for the Stoic doctrine, and for  his own use, that the confidant and the minister of the debaucheries of  Nero would have desired to possess such a slave.\"    Some writers assume that Epictetus was manumitted by his master, but I  can find no evidence for this statement. Epaphroditus accompanied Nero  when he fled from Rome before his enemies, and he aided the miserable  tyrant in killing himself. Domitian (Sueton., Domit. 14), afterwards put  Epaphroditus to death for this service to Nero. We may conclude that  Epictetus in some way obtained his freedom, and that he began to teach  at Rome; but after the expulsion of the philosophers from Rome by  Domitian, A.D. 89, he retired to Nicopolis in Epirus, a city built by  Augustus to commemorate the victory at Actium. Epictetus opened a school  or lecture room at Nicopolis, where he taught till he was an old man.  The time of his death is unknown. Epictetus was never married, as we  learn from Lucian (Demonax, c. 55, torn, ii., ed. Hemsterh., p. 393).  When Epictetus was finding fault with Demonax, and advising him to take  a wife and beget children, for this also, as Epictetus said, was a  philosopher's duty, to leave in place of himself another in the  universe, Demonax refuted the doctrine by answering: Give me then,  Epictetus, one of your own daughters. Simplicius says (Comment., c. 46,  p. 432, ed. Schweigh.) that Epictetus lived alone a long time. At last  he took a woman into his house as a nurse for a child, which one of  Epictetus' friends was going to expose on account of his poverty, but  Epictetus took the child and brought it up.    Epictetus wrote nothing; and all that we have under his name was written  by an affectionate pupil, Arrian, afterwards the historian of Alexander  the Great, who, as he tells us, took down in writing the philosopher's  discourses (\"Epistle of Arrian to Lucius Gellius,\" p. i). These  Discourses formed eight books, but only four are extant under the title  of [Greek: Epichtaeton diatribai]. Simplicius, in his commentary on the  [Greek: Egcheiridion] or Manual, states that this work also was put  together by Arrian, who selected from the discourses of Epictetus what  he considered to be most useful, and most necessary, and most adapted to  move men's minds. Simplicius also says that the contents of the  Encheiridion are found nearly altogether and in the same words in  various parts of the Discourses. Arrian also wrote a work on the life  and death of Epictetus. The events of the philosopher's studious life  were probably not many nor remarkable; but we should have been glad if  this work had been preserved, which told, as Simplicius says, what kind  of man Epictetus was.    Photius (Biblioth., 58) mentions among Arrian's works \"Conversations  with Epictetus,\" [Greek: Homiliai Epichtaeton], in twelve books. Upton  thinks that this work is only another name for the Discourses, and that  Photius has made the mistake of taking the Conversations to be a  different work from the Discourses. Yet Photius has enumerated eight  books of the Discourses and twelve books of the Conversations.  Schweighaeuser observes that Photius had not seen these works of Arrian  on Epictetus, for so he concludes from the brief notice of these works  by Photius. The fact is that Photius does not say that he had read these  books, as he generally does when he is speaking of the books which he  enumerates in his Bibliotheca. The conclusion is that we are not certain  that there was a work of Arrian entitled \"The Conversations of  Epictetus.\"    Upton remarks in a note on iii., 23 (p. 184, Trans.), that \"there are  many passages in these dissertations which are ambiguous or rather  confused on account of the small questions, and because the matter is  not expanded by oratorical copiousness, not to mention other causes.\"  The discourses of Epictetus, it is supposed, were spoken extempore, and  so one thing after another would come into the thoughts of the speaker  (Wolf). Schweighaeuser also observes in a note (ii., 336 of his edition)  that the connection of the discourse is sometimes obscure through the  omission of some words which are necessary to indicate the connection of  the thoughts. The reader then will find that he cannot always understand  Epictetus, if he does not read him very carefully, and some passages  more than once. He must also think and reflect, or he will miss the  meaning. I do not say that the book is worth all this trouble. Every man  must judge for himself. But I should not have translated the book, if I  had not thought it worth study; and I think that all books of this kind  require careful reading, if they are worth reading at all.    G.L.          A SELECTION FROM THE DISCOURSES OF EPICTETUS.      OF THE THINGS WHICH ARE IN OUR POWER AND NOT IN OUR POWER.--Of all the  faculties (except that which I shall soon mention), you will find not  one which is capable of contemplating itself, and, consequently, not  capable either of approving or disapproving. How far does the grammatic  art possess the contemplating power? As far as forming a judgment about  what is written and spoken. And how far music? As far as judging about  melody. Does either of them then contemplate itself? By no means. But  when you must write something to your friend, grammar will tell you what  words you should write; but whether you should write or not, grammar  will not tell you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but  whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute, or do  neither, music will not tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That  which contemplates both itself and all other things. And what is this  faculty? The rational faculty; for this is the only faculty that we have  received which examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and  what is the value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for  what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, for  they do not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is  capable of judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar,  and the other faculties, proves their uses, and points out the occasions  for using them? Nothing else.    What then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? What  else than this? What is mine, and what is not mine; and what is  permitted to me, and what is not permitted to me. I must die. Must I  then die lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I  must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles  and cheerfulness and contentment? Tell me the secret which you possess.  I will not, for this is in my power. But I will put you in chains. Man,  what are you talking about? Me, in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my  will not even Zeus himself can overpower. I will throw you into prison.  My poor body, you mean. I will cut your head off. When then have I told  you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things which  philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which  they should exercise themselves.    What then did Agrippinus say? He said, \"I am not a hindrance to myself.\"  When it was reported to him that his trial was going on in the Senate,  he said: \"I hope it may turn out well; but it is the fifth hour of the  day\"--this was the time when he was used to exercise himself and then  take the cold bath,--\"let us go and take our exercise.\" After he had  taken his exercise, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#1)"],[1,"NIGHT LAND      WILLIAM HOPE HODGSON      1912          THE DREAMS THAT ARE ONLY DREAMS      \"This to be Love, that your spirit to live in a natural holiness with  the Beloved, and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that  shall be never lost of a lovely mystery.... And shame to be unborn, and  all things to go wholesome and proper, out of an utter greatness of  understanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before the Woman;  and the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an Utter Companion  and in the same time a glad Possession unto the Man.... And this doth be  Human Love....\"    \"...for this to be the especial glory of Love, that it doth make unto  all Sweetness and Greatness, and doth be a fire burning all Littleness;  so that did all in this world to have met The Beloved, then did  Wantonness be dead, and there to grow Gladness and Charity, dancing in  the years.\"          I    MIRDATH THE BEAUTIFUL          \"And I cannot touch her face      And I cannot touch her hair,      And I kneel to empty shadows--      Just memories of her grace;      And her voice sings in the winds      And in the sobs of dawn      And among the flowers at night      And from the brooks at sunrise      And from the sea at sunset,      And I answer with vain callings ...\"    It was the Joy of the Sunset that brought us to speech. I was gone a  long way from my house, walking lonely-wise, and stopping often that I  view the piling upward of the Battlements of Evening, and to feel the  dear and strange gathering of the Dusk come over all the world about me.    The last time that I paused, I was truly lost in a solemn joy of the  Glory of the Coming Night; and maybe I laughed a little in my throat,  standing there alone in the midst of the Dusk upon the World. And, lo!  my content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road  upon my right; and it was so as that some one had said: \"And thou also!\"  in glad understanding, that I laughed again a little in my throat; as  though I had only a half-believing that any true human did answer my  laugh; but rather some sweet Delusion or Spirit that was tuned to my  mood.    But she spoke and called me by my name; and when I had gone to the side  of the road, that I should see her somewhat, and discover whether I knew  her, I saw that she was surely that lady, who for her beauty was known  through all of that sweet County of Kent as Lady Mirdath the Beautiful;  and a near neighbour to me; for the Estates of her Guardian abounded  upon mine.    Yet, until that time, I had never met her; for I had been so oft and  long abroad; and so much given to my Studies and my Exercises when at  home, that I had no further Knowledge of her than Rumour gave to me odd  time; and for the rest, I was well content; for as I have given hint, my  books held me, and likewise my Exercises; for I was always an athlete,  and never met the man so quick or so strong as I did be; save in some  fiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster.    Now, I stood instantly with my hat in my hand; and answered her gentle  bantering so well as I might, the while that I peered intent and  wondering at her through the gloom; for truly Rumour had told no tale to  equal the beauty of this strange maid; who now stood jesting with so  sweet a spirit, and claiming kinship of Cousinhood with me, as was  truth, now that I did wake to think.    And, truly, she made no ado; but named me frank by my lad's name, and  gave laughter and right to me to name her Mirdath, and nothing less or  more--at that time. And she bid me then to come up through the hedge,  and make use of a gap that was her own especial secret, as she  confessed, when she took odd leave with her maid to some country frolic,  drest as village maids; but not to deceive many, as I dare believe.    And I came up through the gap in the hedge and stood beside her; and  tall she had seemed to me, when I looked up at her; and tall she was, in  truth; but indeed I was a great head taller. And she invited me then to  walk with her to the house, that I meet her Guardian and give word to my  sorrow that I had so long neglected to make call upon them; and truly  her eyes to shine with mischief and delight, as she named me so for my  amissness.    But, indeed, she grew sober in a moment, and she set up her finger to me  to hush, as that she heard somewhat in the wood that lay all the way  upon our right. And, indeed, something I heard too; for there was surely  a rustling of the leaves, and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear  and sharp in the stillness.    And immediately there came three men running out of the wood at me; and  I called to them sharply to keep off or beware of harm; and I put the  maid to my back with my left hand, and had my oak staff ready for my  use.    But the three men gave out no word of reply; but ran in at me; and I saw  somewhat of the gleam of knives; and at that, I moved very glad and  brisk to the attack; and behind me there went shrill and sweet, the call  of a silver whistle; for the Maid was whistling for her dogs; and maybe  the call was also a signal to the men-servants of her house.    Yet, truly, there was no use in help that was yet to come; for the need  did be then and instant; and I nowise loath to use my strength before  my sweet cousin. And I stepped forward, briskly, as I have told; and  the end of my staff I drove into the body of the left-ward man, so that  he dropped like a dead man. And I hit very sharply at the head of  another, and surely crackt it for him; for he made instantly upon the  earth; but the third man I met with my fist, and neither had he any  great need of a second blow; but went instant to join his companions,  and the fight thus to have ended before it was even proper begun, and I  laughing a little with a proper pride, to know the bewilderment that I  perceived in the way that the Lady Mirdath, my cousin, stood and  regarded me through the dusk of the hushed even.    But, indeed, there was no time left to us, before there came bounding  up, three great boar-hounds, that had been loosed to her whistle; and  she had some ado to keep the brutes off me; and I then to beat them off  the men upon the earth, lest they maul them as they lay. And directly,  there was a noise of men shouting, and the light of lanthorns in the  night, and the footmen of the house to come running with lanthorns and  cudgels; and knew not whether to deal with me, or not, in the first  moment, even as the dogs; but when they saw the men upon the ground, and  learned my name and saw me proper, they kept well their distance and had  no lack of respect; but, indeed, my sweet cousin to have the most of  any; only that she showed no intent to keep distance of me; but to have  a new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first had shown.    And the men-servants asked what should be done with the foot-pads;  seeing that they were now recovering. But, indeed, I left the matter,  along with some silver, to the servants; and very sound justice they  dealt out to the men; for I heard their cries a good while after we had  gone away.    Now, when we were come up to the Hall, my cousin must take me in to her  Guardian, Sir Alfred Jarles, an old man and venerable that I knew a  little in passing and because our estates abounded. And she praised me  to my face, yet quaintly-wise; and the old man, her Guardian thanked me  most honourably and with a nice courtesy; so that I was a welcome  house-friend from that time onward.    And I stayed all that evening, and dined, and afterward went out again  into the home-grounds with the Lady Mirdath; and she more friendly to me  than ever any woman had been; and seemed to me as that she had known me  always. And, truly, I had the same feeling in my heart towards her; for  it was, somehow, as though we knew each the way and turn of the other,  and had a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in  common; but no surprise; save that so pleasant a truth had so natural a  discovery.    And one thing there was that I perceived held the Lady Mirdath all that  dear fore-night; and this was, indeed, the way that I had my pleasure so  easy with the three foot-pads. And she asked me plainly whether I was  not truly very strong; and when I laughed with young and natural pride,  she caught my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong I might  be. And, surely, she loosed it even the more sudden, and with a little  gasping of astonishment, because it was so great and hard. And  afterward, she walked by me very silent, and seeming thoughtful; but she  went never any great way off from me.    And, truly, if the Lady Mirdath had a strange pleasure in my strength, I  had likewise a constant wonder and marvel in her beauty, that had shown  but the more lovely in the candle-light at dinner.    But there were further delights to me in the days that came; for I had  happiness in the way that she had pleasure of the Mystery of the  Evening, and the Glamour of Night, and the Joy of Dawn, and all  suchlike.    And one evening, that I ever remember, as we wandered in the park-lands,  she began to say--half unthinking--that it was truly an elves-night. And  she stopped herself immediately; as though she thought I should have no  understanding; but, indeed, I was upon mine own familiar ground of  inward delight; and I replied in a quiet and usual voice, that the  Towers of Sleep would grow that night, and I felt in my bones that it  was a night to find the Giant's Tomb, or the Tree with the Great Painted  Head, or--And surely I stopped very sudden; for she gripped me in that  moment, and her hand shook as she held me; but when I would ask her what  ailed, she bid me, very breathless, to say on, to say on. And, with a  half understanding, I told her that I had but meant to speak of the Moon  Garden, that was an olden and happy fancy of mine.    And, in verity, when I said that, the "]]]
