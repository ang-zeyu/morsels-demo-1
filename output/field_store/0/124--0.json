CHAPTER I.    _No subject more pleasing than that of the removal of evils--Evils have  existed almost from the beginning of the world--but there is a power in our  nature to counteract them--this power increased by Christianity--of the  evils removed by Christianity one of the greatest is the Slave-trade--The  joy we ought to feel on its abolition from a contemplation of the nature of  it--and of the extent of it--and of the difficulty of subduing  it--Usefulness also of the contemplation of this subject_.      I scarcely know of any subject, the contemplation of which, is more  pleasing than that of the correction or of the removal of any of the  acknowledged evils of life; for while we rejoice to think that the  sufferings of our fellow-creatures have been thus, in any instance,  relieved, we must rejoice equally to think that our own moral condition  must have been necessarily improved by the change.    That evils, both physical and moral, have existed long upon earth there can  be no doubt. One of the sacred writers, to whom we more immediately appeal  for the early history of mankind, informs us that the state of our first  parents was a state of innocence and happiness; but that, soon after their  creation, sin and misery entered into the world. The Poets in their fables,  most of which, however extravagant they may seem, had their origin in  truth, speak the same language. Some of these represent the first condition  of man by the figure of the golden, and his subsequent degeneracy and  subjection to suffering by that of the silver, and afterwards of the iron,  age. Others tell us that the first female was made of clay; that she was  called Pandora, because every necessary gift, qualification, or endowment,  was given to her by the Gods, but that she received from Jupiter at the  same time, a box, from which, when opened, a multitude of disorders sprung,  and that these spread themselves immediately afterwards among all of the  human race. Thus it appears, whatever authorities we consult, that those  which may be termed the evils of life existed in the earliest times. And  what does subsequent history, combined with our own experience, tell us,  but that these have been continued, or that they have come down, in  different degrees, through successive generations of men, in all the known  countries of the universe, to the present day?    But though the inequality visible in the different conditions of life, and  the passions interwoven into our nature, (both which have been allotted to  us for wise purposes, and without which we could not easily afford a proof  of the existence of that which is denominated virtue,) have a tendency to  produce vice and wretchedness among us, yet we see in this our constitution  what may operate partially as preventives and correctives of them. If there  be a radical propensity in our nature to do that which is wrong, there is  on the other hand a counteracting power within it, or an impulse, by means  of the action of the Divine Spirit upon our minds, which urges us to do  that which is right. If the voice of temptation, clothed in musical and  seducing accents, charms us one way, the voice of holiness, speaking to us  from within in a solemn and powerful manner, commands us another. Does one  man obtain a victory over his corrupt affections? an immediate perception  of pleasure, like the feeling of a reward divinely conferred upon him, is  noticed.--Does another fall prostrate beneath their power? a painful  feeling, and such as pronounces to him the sentence of reproof and  punishment, is found to follow.--If one, by suffering his heart to become  hardened, oppresses a fellow-creature, the tear of sympathy starts up in  the eye of another, and the latter instantly feels a desire, involuntarily  generated, of flying to his relief. Thus impulses, feelings, and  dispositions have been implanted in our nature for the purpose of  preventing and rectifying the evils of life. And as these have operated so  as to stimulate some men to lessen them by the exercise of an amiable  charity, so they have operated to stimulate others, in various other ways,  to the same end. Hence the philosopher has left moral precepts behind him  in favour of benevolence, and the legislator has endeavoured to prevent  barbarous practices by the introduction of laws.    In consequence then of these impulses and feelings, by which the pure power  in our nature is thus made to act as a check upon the evil part of it, and  in consequence of the influence which philosophy and legislative wisdom  have had in their respective provinces, there has been always, in all times  and countries, a counteracting energy, which has opposed itself more or  less to the crimes and miseries of mankind. But it seems to have been  reserved for Christianity to increase this energy, and to give it the  widest possible domain. It was reserved for her, under the same Divine  Influence, to give the best views of the nature, and of the present and  future condition of man; to afford the best moral precepts, to communicate  the most benign stimulus to the heart, to produce the most blameless  conduct, and thus to cut off many of the causes of wretchedness, and to  heal it wherever it was found. At her command, wherever she has been duly  acknowledged, many of the evils of life have already fled. The prisoner of  war is no longer led into the amphitheatre to become a gladiator, and to  imbrue his hands in the blood of his fellow-captive for the sport of a  thoughtless multitude. The stern priest, cruel through fanaticism and  custom, no longer leads his fellow-creature to the altar, to sacrifice him  to fictitious Gods. The venerable martyr, courageous through faith and the  sanctity of his life, is no longer hurried to the flames. The haggard  witch, poring over her incantations by moon-light, no longer scatters her  superstitious poison among her miserable neighbours, nor suffers for her  crime.    But in whatever way Christianity may have operated towards the increase of  this energy, or towards a diminution of human misery, it has operated in  none more powerfully than by the new views, and consequent duties, which it  introduced on the subject of charity, or practical benevolence and love.  Men in ancient times looked upon their talents, of whatever description, as  their own, which they might use or cease to use at their discretion. But  the author of our religion was the first who taught that, however in a  legal point of view the talent of individuals might belong exclusively to  themselves, so that no other person had a right to demand the use of it by  force, yet in the Christian dispensation they were but the stewards of it  for good; that so much was expected from this stewardship, that it was  difficult for those who were entrusted with it to enter into his spiritual  kingdom; that these had no right to conceal their talent in a napkin; but  that they were bound to dispense a portion of it to the relief of their  fellow-creatures; and that in proportion to the magnitude of it they were  accountable for the extensiveness of its use. He was the first, who  pronounced the misapplication of it to be a crime, and to be a crime of no  ordinary dimension. He was the first who broke down the boundary between  Jew and Gentile, and therefore the first, who pointed out to men the  inhabitants of other countries for the exercise of their philanthropy and  love. Hence a distinction is to be made both in the principle and practice  of charity, as existing in ancient or in modern times. Though the old  philosophers, historians, and poets, frequently inculcated benevolence, we  have no reason to conclude from any facts they have left us, that persons  in their days did any thing more than occasionally relieve an unfortunate  object, who might present himself before them, or that, however they might  deplore the existence of public evils among them, they joined in  associations for their suppression, or that they carried their charity, as  bodies of men, into other kingdoms. To Christianity alone we are indebted  for the new and sublime spectacle of seeing men going beyond the bounds of  individual usefulness to each other--of seeing them associate for the  extirpation of private and public misery--and of seeing them carry their  charity, as a united brotherhood, into distant lands. And in this wider  field of benevolence it would be unjust not to confess, that no country has  shone with more true lustre than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#1)"],[1,"BIBLE'S MESSAGE TO MODERN LIFE    Twelve Studies on    The Making of a Nation    The Beginnings of Israel's History          BY        CHARLES FOSTER KENT  JEREMIAH WHIPPLE JENKS            1912        The best of allies you can procure for us is the Bible.

If the common schools have found their way from the Atlantic to the  Pacific; if slavery has been abolished; if the whole land has been  changed from a wilderness into a garden of plenty, from ocean to  ocean; if education has been fostered according to the best lights  of each generation since then; if industry, frugality and sobriety  are the watchwords of the nation, as I believe them to be, I say it  is largely due to those first emigrants, who, landing with the  English Bible in their hands and in their hearts, established  themselves on the shores of America.--_Joseph H. Choate_.    And, as it is owned, the whole scheme of Scripture is not yet  understood, so, if it comes to be understood, it must be in the  same way as natural knowledge is come at; by the continuance and  progress of learning and liberty, and by particular persons  attending to, comparing and pursuing intimations scattered up and  down it, which are overlooked and disregarded by the generality of  the world.  Nor is it at all incredible that a book which has been  so long in the possession of mankind should contain many truths as  yet undiscovered.--_Butler_.    Mr. Lincoln, as I saw him every morning, in the carpet slippers he  wore in the house and the black clothes no tailor could make really  fit his gaunt, bony frame, was a homely enough figure.  The routine  of his life was simple, too; it would have seemed a treadmill to  most of us.  He was an early riser, when I came on duty at eight in  the morning, he was often already dressed and reading in the  library.  There was a big table near the centre of the room: there  I have seen him reading many times.  And the book?  It was the  Bible which I saw him reading while most of the household  slept.--_William H. Crook_, in _Harper's Magazine_.    The Bible has such power for teaching righteousness that even to  those who come to it with all sorts of false notions about the God  of the Bible, it yet teaches righteousness, and fills them with the  love of it; how much more those who come to it with a true notion  about the God of the Bible.--_Matthew Arnold_.

INTRODUCTION    THE REDISCOVERY OF THE BIBLE    In the early Christian centuries thousands turned to the Bible, as  drowning men to a life buoy, because it offered them the only way  of escape from the intolerable social and moral ills that attended  the death pangs of the old heathenism.  Then came the Dark Ages,  with their resurgent heathenism and barbarism, when the Bible was  taken from the hands of the people.  In the hour of a nation's  deepest humiliation and moral depravity, John Wycliffe, with the  aid of a devoted army of lay priests, gave back the Bible to the  people, and in so doing laid the foundations for England's  intellectual, political and moral greatness.  The joy and  inspiration of the Protestant Reformers was the rediscovery and  popular interpretation of the Bible.  In all the great forward  movements of the modern centuries the Bible has played a central  role.  The ultimate basis of our magnificent modern scientific and  material progress is the inspiration given to the human race by the  Protestant Reformation.    Unfortunately, the real meaning and message of the Bible has been  in part obscured during past centuries by dogmatic interpretations.  The study of the Bible has also been made a solemn obligation  rather than a joyous privilege.  The remarkable discoveries of the  present generation and its new and larger sense of power and  progress have tended to turn men's attention from the contemplation  of the heritage which comes to them from the past.  The result is  that most men know little about the Bible.  They are acquainted  with its chief characters such as Abraham, David and Jesus.  A few  are even able to give a clear-cut outline of the important events  of Israel's history; but they regard it simply as a history whose  associations and interests belong to a bygone age.  How many  realize that most of the problems which Israel met and solved are  similar to those which to-day are commanding the absorbing  attention of every patriotic citizen, and that of all existing  books, the Old Testament makes the greatest contributions to the  political and social, as well as to the religious thought of the  world?  National expansion, taxation, centralization of authority,  civic responsibility, the relation of religion to politics and to  public morality were as vital and insistent problems in ancient  Israel as they are in any live, progressive nation to-day.  The  gradual discovery of this fact explains why here and there  through-out the world the leaders in modern thought and progress  are studying the Bible with new delight and enthusiasm; not only  because of its intrinsic beauty and interest, but because in it  they find, stated in clearest form, the principles which elucidate  the intricate problems of modern life.        THE OBJECTS OF THESE STUDIES,    There are two distinct yet important ways of interpreting the  Bible: The one is that of the scholar who knows the Bible from the"]]]
