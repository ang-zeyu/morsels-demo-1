SLAVE-DRIVER AND FRIEND          Introduction      Father, what is a Legislature?    A representative body elected by the people of the state.    Are women people?    No, my son, criminals, lunatics and women are not people.    Do legislators legislate for nothing?    Oh, no; they are paid a salary.    By whom?    By the people.    Are women people?    Of course, my son, just as much as men are.    To the New York Tribune, in whose generous columns many of these  verses first appeared, the author here wishes to express her gratitude.

A Consistent Anti to Her Son    (\"Look at the hazards, the risks, the physical dangers that ladies would  be exposed to at the polls.\"--_Anti-suffrage speech_.)          You're twenty-one to-day, Willie,        And a danger lurks at the door,      I've known about it always,        But I never spoke before;      When you were only a baby        It seemed so very remote,      But you're twenty-one to-day, Willie,        And old enough to vote.        You must not go to the polls, Willie,        Never go to the polls,      They're dark and dreadful places        Where many lose their souls;      They smirch, degrade and coarsen,        Terrible things they do      To quiet, elderly women--        What would they do to you!        If you've a boyish fancy        For any measure or man,      Tell me, and I'll tell Father,        He'll vote for it, if he can.      He casts my vote, and Louisa's,        And Sarah, and dear Aunt Clo;      Wouldn't you let him vote for you?        Father, who loves you so?        I've guarded you always, Willie,        Body and soul from harm;      I'll guard your faith and honor,        Your innocence and charm      From the polls and their evil spirits,        Politics, rum and pelf;      Do you think I'd send my only son        Where I would not go myself?          Our Idea of Nothing at All      (\"I am opposed to woman suffrage, but I am not opposed to  woman.\"--_Anti-suffrage speech of Mr. Webb of North Carolina_.)          O women, have you heard the news        Of charity and grace?      Look, look, how joy and gratitude        Are beaming in my face!      For Mr. Webb is not opposed        To woman in her place!        O Mr. Webb, how kind you are        To let us live at all,      To let us light the kitchen range        And tidy up the hall;      To tolerate the female sex        In spite of Adam's fall.        O girls, suppose that Mr. Webb        Should alter his decree!      Suppose he were opposed to us--        Opposed to you and me.      What would be left for us to do--        Except to cease to be?          Lines to Mr. Bowdle of Ohio      (\"The women of this smart capital are beautiful. Their beauty is  disturbing to business; their feet are beautiful, their ankles are  beautiful, but here I must pause.\"--_Mr. Bowdle's anti-suffrage speech  in Congress, January 12, 1915_.)          You, who despise the so-called fairer sex,        Be brave. There really isn't any reason      You should not, if you wish, oppose and vex        And scold us in, and even out of season;      But don't regard it as your bounden duty      To open with a tribute to our beauty.        Say if you like that women have no sense,        No self-control, no power of concentration;      Say that hysterics is our one defence        Our virtue but an absence of temptation;      These I can bear, but, oh, I own it rankles      To hear you maundering on about our ankles.        Tell those old stories, which have now and then        Been from the Record thoughtfully deleted,      Repeat that favorite one about the hen,        Repeat the ones that cannot be repeated;      But in the midst of such enjoyments, smother      The impulse to extol your \"sainted mother.\"          On Not Believing All You Hear      (\"Women are angels, they are jewels, they are queens and princesses of  our hearts.\"--_Anti-suffrage speech of Mr. Carter of Oklahoma_.)          \"Angel, or jewel, or princess, or queen,      Tell me immediately, where have you been?\"        \"I've been to ask all my slaves so devoted      Why they against my enfranchisement voted.\"        \"Angel and princess, that action was wrong.      Back to the kitchen, where angels belong.\"          The Revolt of Mother      (\"Every true woman feels----\"--_Speech of almost any Congressman_.)          I am old-fashioned, and I think it right        That man should know, by Nature's laws eternal,      The proper way to rule, to earn, to fight,        And exercise those functions called paternal;      But even I a little bit rebel      At finding that he knows my job as well.        At least he's always ready to expound it,        Especially in legislative hall,      The joys, the cares, the halos that surround it,        \"How women feel\"--he knows that best of all.      In fact his thesis is that no one can      Know what is womanly except a man.        I am old-fashioned, and I am content        When he explains the world of art and science      And government--to him divinely sent--        I drink it in with ladylike compliance.      But cannot listen--no, I'm only human--      While he instructs me how to be a woman.          The Gallant Sex      (A woman engineer has been dismissed by the Board of Education, under  their new rule that women shall not attend high pressure boilers,  although her work has been satisfactory and she holds a license to  attend such boilers from the Police Department.)          Lady, dangers lurk in boilers,        Risks I could not let you face.      Men were meant to be the toilers,        Home, you know, is woman's place.      Have no home? Well, is that so?      Still, it's not my fault, you know.        Charming lady, work no more;        Fair you are and sweet as honey;      Work might make your fingers sore,        And, besides, I need the money.      Prithee rest,--or starve or rob--      Only let me have your job!          Representation      (\"My wife is against suffrage, and that settles me.\"--_Vice-President  Marshall_.)      I        My wife dislikes the income tax,        And so I cannot pay it;      She thinks that golf all interest lacks,        So now I never play it;      She is opposed to tolls repeal        (Though why I cannot say),      But woman's duty is to feel,        And man's is to obey.    II        I'm in a hard position for a perfect gentleman,      I want to please the ladies, but I don't see how I can,      My present wife's a suffragist, and counts on my support,      But my mother is an anti, of a rather biting sort;      One grandmother is on the fence, the other much opposed,      And my sister lives in Oregon, and thinks the question's closed;      Each one is counting on my vote to represent her view.      Now what should you think proper for a gentleman to do?          Sonnet      (\"Three bills known as the Thompson-Bewley cannery bills have been  advanced to third reading in the Senate and Assembly at Albany. One  permits the canners to work their employes seven days a week, a second  allows them to work women after 9 p.m. and a third removes every  restriction upon the hours of labor of women and minors.\"--_Zenas L.  Potter, former chief cannery investigator for New York State Factory  Investigating Commission_.)          Let us not to an unrestricted day      Impediments admit. Work is not work      To our employes, but a merry play;      They do not ask the law's excuse to shirk.      Ah, no, the canning season is at hand,      When summer scents are on the air distilled,      When golden fruits are ripening in the land,      And silvery tins are gaping to be filled.      Now to the cannery with jocund mien      Before the dawn come women, girls and boys,      Whose weekly hours (a hundred and nineteen)      Seem all too short for their industrious joys.        If this be error and be proved, alas        The Thompson-Bewley bills may fail to pass!          To President Wilson      (\"I hold it as a fundamental principle and so do you, that every people  has the right to determine its own form of government. And until  recently 50 per cent, of the people of Mexico have not had a look-in in  determining who should be their governors, or what their government  should be.\"--_Speech of President Wilson_.)          Wise and just man--for such I think you are--      How can you see so burningly and clear      Injustices and tyrannies afar,      Yet blind your eyes to one that lies so near?      How can you plead so earnestly for men      Who fight their own fight with a bloody hand;      How hold their cause so wildly dear, and then      Forget the women of your native land?      With your stern ardor and your scholar's word      You speak to us of human liberty;      Can you believe that women are not stirred      By this same human longing to be free?        He who for liberty would strike a blow        Need not take arms, or fly to Mexico.          Home and Where It Is      (An Indiana judge has recently ruled: As to the right of the husband to  decide the location of the home that \"home is where the husband is.\")          Home is where the husband is,      Be it near or be it far,      Office, theatre, Pullman car,      Poolroom, polls, or corner bar--      All good wives remember this--      Home is where the husband is.        Woman's place is home, I wis.

Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures, Columbia University        He kept the faith. The ardent poet-soul,    Once thrilled to madness by the fiery gleam    Of Freedom glimpsed afar in youthful dream,    Henceforth was true as needle to the pole.    The vision he had caught remained the goal    Of manhood's aspiration and the theme    Of those high luminous musings that redeem    Our souls from bondage to the general dole    Of trivial existence. Calm and free    He faced the Sphinx, nor ever knew dismay,    Nor bowed to externalities the knee,    Nor took a guerdon from the fleeting day;    But dwelt on earth in that eternity    Where Truth and Beauty shine with blended ray.[2]    Friedrich Schiller, the greatest of German dramatic poets, was born  November 10, 1759, at Marbach in Swabia. His father was an officer in  the army which the Duke of Wuerttemberg sent out to fight the Prussians  in the Seven Years' War. Of his mother, whose maiden name was Dorothea  Kodweis, not much is known. She was a devout woman who lived in the  cares and duties of a household that sometimes felt the pinch of  poverty. After the war the family lived a while at the village of  Lorch, where Captain Schiller was employed as recruiting officer. From  there they moved, in 1766, to Ludwigsburg, where the extravagant duke  Karl Eugen had taken up his residence and was bent on creating a sort  of Swabian Versailles. Here little Fritz went to school and was  sometimes taken to the gorgeous ducal opera, where he got his first  notions of scenic illusion. The hope of his boyhood was to become a  preacher, but this pious aspiration was brought to naught by the offer  of free tuition in an academy which the duke had started at his Castle  Solitude near Stuttgart.    This academy was Schiller's world from his fourteenth to his  twenty-first year. It was an educational experiment conceived in a  rather liberal spirit as a training-school for public service. At  first the duke had the boys taught under his own eye at Castle  Solitude, where they were subjected to a strict military discipline.  There being no provision for the study of divinity, Schiller was put  into law, with the result that he floundered badly for two years. In  1775 the institution was augmented by a faculty of medicine and  transferred to Stuttgart, where it was destined to a short-lived  career under the name of the Karlschule. Schiller gladly availed  himself of the permission to change from law to medicine, which he  thought would be more in harmony with his temperament and literary  ambitions. And so it proved. As a student of medicine he made himself  at home in the doctrines and practices of the day, and for several  years after he left school he thought now and then of returning to the  profession of medicine.    For posterity the salient fact of his long connection with the  Karlschule is that he was there converted into a fiery radical and a  banner-bearer of the literary revolution. Just how it came about is  hard to explain in detail. The school was designed to produce docile  and contented members of the social order; in him it bred up a savage  and relentless critic of that order. The result may be ascribed  partly, no doubt, to the natural reaction of an ardent, liberty-loving  temperament against a system of rigid discipline and petty espionage.  The _eleves_--French was the official language of the school--were not  supposed to read dangerous books, and their rooms were often searched  for contraband literature. But they easily found ways to evade the  rule and enjoy the savor of forbidden fruit.    [Illustration: FRIEDRICH VON SCHILLER]    So it was with Schiller: he read Rousseau more or less, the early  works of Goethe, Lessing's _Emilia Galotti_, and plays by Klinger,  Leisewitz, Lenz and Wagner--all more or less revolutionary in spirit.  He also made the acquaintance of Shakespeare and steeped himself in  the spirit of antique heroism as he found it in Plutarch.    Perhaps this reading would have made a radical of him even if he had  just then been enjoying the normal freedom of a German university  student. Be that as it may, the time came--it was about 1777--when the  young Schiller, faithfully pursuing his medical course and doing loyal  birthday orations in praise of the duke or the duke's mistress, was  not exactly what he seemed to be. Underneath the calm exterior there  was a soul on fire with revolutionary passion.    It was mainly in 1780--his last year in the Karlschule--that Schiller  wrote _The Robbers_, altogether the loudest explosion of the Storm and  Stress. The hero, Karl Moor, was conceived as a \"sublime criminal.\"  Deceived by the machinations of his villainous brother Franz, he  becomes the captain of a band of outlaws and attempts by murder, arson  and robbery to right the wrongs of the social order. For a while he  believes that he is doing a noble work. When he learns how he has been  deluded he gives himself up to the law. The effect of the play is that  of tremendous power unchecked by any of the restraints of art. The  plot is incredible, the language tense with turbulent passion, and the  characters are extravagantly overdrawn. But the genius of the born  dramatist is there. It is all vividly seen and powerfully bodied  forth. What is more important, the play marks the birth of a new  type--the tragedy of fanaticism. We are left at the end with a  heightened feeling for the mysterious tangle of human destiny which  makes it possible for a really noble nature such as Karl Moor to go  thus disastrously wrong.    Toward the end of 1780 Schiller left the academy and was made doctor  to a regiment of soldiers consisting largely of invalids. He dosed  them with drastic medicines according to his light, but the service  was disagreeable and the pay very small. To make a stir in the world  he borrowed money and published _The Robbers_ as a book for the  reader, with a preface in which he spoke rather slightingly of the  theatre. The book came out in the spring of 1781--with a rampant lion  and the motto _in Tirannos_ on the title-page. Ere long it came to the  attention of Dalberg, director of the theatre at Mannheim, who saw  its dramatic qualities and requested its author to revise it for the  stage. This Schiller readily consented to do. To please Dalberg he set  the action back from the eighteenth to the sixteenth century and made  many minor changes. The revised play was performed at Mannheim on  January 12, 1782, with ever-memorable success. The audience, assembled  from far and near, went wild with enthusiasm. No such triumph had been  achieved before on a German stage. The author himself saw the  performance, having come over from Stuttgart without leave of absence.  For this breach of discipline, or rather for a repetition of the  offense in May, he was sent to the guardhouse for a fortnight and  forbidden to write any more plays. The consequence was a clandestine  flight from a situation that had"]]]
