The material, for the most part gathered  in texts, was partially translated in the Islands, while the balance  was worked over during a brief visit to America in 1909. In this task  I was assisted by Dumagat, a full blood Tinguian, who accompanied me.    While not, in all cases, giving a literal rendering, I have endeavored  to follow closely the language of the story-tellers rather than to  offer a polished translation. In some cases, where it was impossible  to record the tales when heard, only the substance was noted, a fact  which will account for the meagerness of detail evident in a few of  the stories.    The Tinguian tribe numbers about twenty thousand individuals,  most of whom are found in the sub-province of Abra, and in the  mountains of Ilocos Sur and Norte. Their material culture, beliefs,  and ceremonials are quite uniform and exceedingly complex. It is my  intention to publish a study of this people in the near future, but  realizing that it will be quite impossible for readers unacquainted  with Tinguian life to understand many references in the tales, I  have added such foot notes as will enable them to grasp the meaning  of certain obscure passages.    In the introduction, an attempt has been made to bring together the  culture of the people as it appears in the myths, and to contrast it  with present day conditions and beliefs. In this way we may hope to  gain a clearer insight into their mental life, and to secure a better  idea of the values they attach to certain of their activities than  is afforded us by actual observation or by direct inquiry. It is also  possible that the tales may give us a glimpse of the early conditions  under which this people developed, of their life and culture before  the advent of the European.    It should be noted at the outset that no attempt is here made to  reconstruct an actual historical period. As will appear later, a  part of the material is evidently very old; later introductions--to  which approximate dates may be assigned--have assumed places of great  importance; while the stories doubtless owe much to the creative  imaginations of successive story-tellers.    A comparison of these tales with the folk-lore of neighboring tribes  would be of greatest value, but unfortunately very little material  for such a study is available. Under the circumstances it has seemed  best to defer the attempt and to call attention in the footnotes to  striking similarities with other fields.    In the main these tales are so closely associated with the religious  beliefs of the present day that it is unlikely they will be found,  in anything approaching their present form, outside the districts  dominated by this tribe. Nevertheless, isolated incidents corresponding  to those of neighboring peoples or even of distant lands occur  several times.    Observation has led me to the belief that the religious organization  and ceremonies of the Tinguian have reached a higher development  than is found among the neighboring tribes, and that this complexity  decreases as we penetrate toward the interior or to the south. If  this be true, it seems evident that the tales based on or associated  with them must likewise grow weaker as we go from Abra.    I wish here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Franz Boas and  Dr. Berthold Laufer, whose interest and suggestions have been of  greatest value in the preparation of the material for publication;  also to express my gratitude to the late Robert F. Cummings, under  whose liberal endowment the field work was carried on. His constant  interest made possible the gathering of the extensive Philippine  collections now in the Museum, and it is a matter of deep regret  that he did not live to see all the results of his generosity made  available to the reading public.      Fay-Cooper Cole,    Assistant Curator of Malayan Ethnology.    Chicago, January, 1915.          Traditions of the Tinguian: A Study in Philippine Folk-Lore      Introduction    For the purposes of our study, the tales have been roughly divided  into three parts. The first, which deals with the mythical period,  contains thirty-one tales of similar type in which the characters  are for the most part the same, although the last five tales do not  properly fit into the cycle, and the concluding story of Indayo is  evidently a recent account told in the form of the older relations.    In the second division are the ritualistic and explanatory myths,  the object of which seems to be to account for the origin of or way  of conducting various ceremonies; for the belief in certain spirits  and sacred objects; for the existence of the sun, moon, and other  natural phenomena; for the attainment of fire, food plants, birds  and domestic animals, as well as of magical jars and beads. Here it  should be noted that some of the most common and important beliefs  and ceremonies are, so far as is known, unaccompanied by any tales,  yet are known to all the population, and are preserved almost without  change from generation to generation.    Division three contains the ordinary stories with which parents amuse  their children or with which men and women while away the midday  hours as they lounge in the field houses, or when they stop on the  trail to rest and smoke.    None of the folk-tales are considered as the property of the tellers,  but only those of the third division are well known to the people in  general. Those of the first section are seldom heard except during the  dry season when the people gather around bonfires in various parts of  the village. To these go the men and women, the latter to spin cotton,  the former to make fish nets or to repair their tools and weapons. In  such a gathering there are generally one or more persons who entertain  their fellows with these tales. Such a person is not paid for his  services, but the fact that he knows \"the stories of the first times\"  makes him a welcome addition to the company and gives him an enviable  position in the estimation of his fellows.    The purely ritualistic tales, called _diams_, are learned word  by word by the mediums, [1] as a part of their training for their  positions, and are only recited while an animal is being stroked with  oil preparatory to its being sacrificed, or when some other gift is  about to be presented to the superior beings. The writer has recorded  these _diams_ from various mediums in widely separated towns and has  found them quite uniform in text and content. The explanatory tales  were likewise secured from the mediums, or from old men and women who  \"know the customs.\" The stories of the last division are the most  frequently heard and, as already indicated, are told by all. It is  evident even to the casual reader that these show much more evidence  of outside influence than do the others; some, indeed, appear to have  been recently borrowed from the neighboring christianized Ilocano. [2]      Tales of the Mythical Period    _Reconstruction of the Culture_.--In the first division certain  actors occur with great frequency, while others always take the  leading parts. These latter appear under a variety of names, two or  more titles often being used for the same individual in a single  tale. To avoid confusion a list of the fourteen principal actors  and their relationships are given in the accompanying table. It will  appear that there are some conflicts in the use of names, but when it  is realized that the first twenty-six myths which make up the cycle  proper were secured from six story tellers coming from four different  towns, the agreement rather than the disagreement is surprising. As a  matter of fact there is quite as much variation between the accounts  of the same narrator as between those gathered from different towns.    _Table of Leading Characters_ [3]    I. Aponitolau.

In No. 514 of _The Mirror_ we explained the situation of the Lowther  Arcade. We may here observe that this covered way or arcade intersects the  insulated triangle of buildings lately completed in the Strand, the  principal facade of which is designated _West Strand_.    The Engraving represents the interior of the Arcade, similar in its use to  the Burlington Arcade, and, although wider and more lofty, including three  stories in height, it is not so long. The passage forms an acute angle  with the Strand, running to the back of St. Martin's Church, and is  divided by large pilasters into a succession of compartments; the  pilasters are joined by an arch; and the compartments are domed over, and  lighted in the centre by large domical lights, which illuminate the whole  passage in a perfect manner. \"All the shop-fronts are decorated in a  similar manner, and the whole has been designed and executed with great  care by the builder, Mr. Herbert. The shops on the exterior are designed  to have the appearance of one great whole. The style of architecture is  Grecian, and the order employed Corinthian: the angles are finished in a  novel manner, with double circular buildings, having the roof domed in  brick, with an ornament as a finish to the top of the dome. The effect of  the whole would be agreeable if it had the appearance of a solid basement  to stand upon; but as tradesmen find it necessary to have as much open  space as possible to exhibit their goods, the mass of architecture above  must appear to be supported by the window-frames of the shops, although in  reality they are based upon small iron columns of four and six inches  diameter, which are scarcely seen, and which offer the slightest possible  impediment to the exhibition of goods.\"    We may add that the Arcade at night is lit with gas within elegant  vase-shaped shades of ground glass, branching from each side. The  ornaments of the domes, especially that of the Caduceus, are introduced  with good effect.    We take the introduction of this and similar passages in the British  metropolis to have been originally from the French capital. Thus, in Paris  are the _Passage des Panoramas_; _the Passage Delorme_; the _Passage  d'Artois_; the _Passage Feydeau_; the _Passage de Caire_; and the _Passage  Montesquieu_. A more grandiloquent name applied by the French to some of  their passages is _galerie_: we remember the _Galerie Vivienne_ as one of  the most splendid specimens, with its _marchands_ of artificial luxuries.  The _Galerie Vero Dodat_, (we think shorter than the Lowther Arcade,) is  in the extreme of shop-front magnificence: the floor is of alternate  squares of black and white marble, and the fronts are of plate-glass with  highly-polished brass frames, and we doubt whether that common material,  wood, is to be seen in the doors. This _Galerie_ is named after its  proprietor, M. Vero Dodat, an opulent _charcutier_, (a pork-butcher) in  the neighbouring street; but we are unable to inform the reader by how  many horse power his sausage-chopping machine is worked.           *       *       *       *       *    VIRGINIA WATER.    (_To the Editor_.)      In No. 533 of _The Mirror_ is a Cut of the _Cascade_ at Virginia Water  (which by the way is a very correct one, with the keeper's lodge in the  distance) which you state was the late King's own planing; but such was  not the case, as it was built in the reign of George the Third; the late  king merely added improvements about it, one of which was the building of  a rude bridge a little below the cascade, of stones similar to the fall:  this bridge connects a favourite drive down to the nursery.    _Brighton_.        E.E.           *       *       *       *       *    FISHING IN CANADA.    (_To the Editor_.)      It may be entertaining to many of your readers now that emigration  occupies the thoughts of so many, to sketch a short account of the method  chiefly employed in Canada, in capturing fish, which to very many settlers  is an important adjunct to their domestic economy. Those living on the  borders of the numerous lakes and rivers of Canada, which are invariably  stored with fine fish, are provided with either a light boat, log, or what  is by far the best, a bark canoe; a barbed fishing spear, with light  tapering shaft, about twelve or sixteen feet long, and an iron basket for  holding pine knots, and capable of being suspended at the head of the boat  when fired. In the calm evenings after dusk, many of these lights are seen  stealing out from the woody bays in the lakes, towards the best fishing  grounds, and two or three canoes together, with the reflection of the red  light from the clear green water on the bronzed faces of either the native  Indian, or the almost as wild Backwoodsman, compose an extraordinary scene:  the silence of the night is undisturbed, save by the gurgling noise of the  paddles, as guided by the point of the spear; the canoe whirls on its axis  with an almost dizzing velocity, or the sudden dash of the spear, followed  by the struggles of the transfixed fish, or perhaps the characteristic  \"Eh,\" from the Indian steersman. In this manner, sometimes fifty or sixty  fish of three or four pounds are speared in the course of a night,  consisting of black bass, white fish, and sometimes a noble maskimongi. A  little practice soon enables the young settler to take an active part in  this pursuit. The light seems to attract the fish, as round it they  thickly congregate. But few fish are caught in this country by the fly: at  some seasons, however, the black bass will rise to it. A CANADIAN.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ARBALEST, OR CROSS-BOW.    (_To the Editor_.)      No. 538, of _The Mirror_, contains a very interesting memoir on the  subject of the Cross-bow, but I do not find that the mode of bending the  steel bow has been described; which from its great strength it is evident  could not be accomplished without the assistance of some mechanical power.  This in the more modern bows is attained by the application of a piece of  steel, which lies along the front of the stem, and is moved forward on a  pivot until the string is caught by a hook, and a lever is thus obtained,  by means of which the bow is drawn to its proper extent. It seems to me  that this is the description of bow of which your correspondent has  furnished a drawing. Another mode, and which appears to have been applied  to the ancient bows, was by a sort of two-handed windlass, with ropes and  pulleys, called a _\"moulinet_,\" which was temporarily attached to the  butt-end of the Cross-bow; of this a drawing is given in the illustrations  of Froissart's _Chronicles_, particularly in that one descriptive of the  Siege of Aubenton; in which two bowmen are shown, one in the act of  winding up the bow, and the other taking his aim, the _moulinet_, &c.  lying at his feet. Of this latter description, there are two specimens  preserved in the Tower of London, both of about the period of our Henry  the Sixth.    C.P.C.           *       *       *       *       *    LINES TO A LARK.    (_For the Mirror_.)        Upon thy happy flight to heaven, again, sweet      bird, thou art;    The morning beam is on thy wings, its influence      in thy heart;    Like matin hymns blest spirits sing in yonder      happy sky,    Break on the ear, the small, sweet notes of thy      wild melody.      Cold winter winds are far away, the cruel snows      have past;    And spring's sweet skies, and blushing flowers      shine o'er the world at last;    Where the young corn springs fresh, and green,      sweet flowerets gather'd he,    And form around thy lowly nest a shelter sweet      for thee.      Is it not this which wakes thy song, with thoughts of      summer hours,    When warmer hues shall clothe the skies, and      darker shades the bowers;    Has nature to thy throbbing heart such glowing      feelings given,    That thou canst feel the beautiful, of this bright      earth and heaven.      If so, how blest must be thy lot, from azure      skies to gaze,    When the fresh morn is in the heavens, or      mid-day splendours blaze;    Or when the sunset's canopy of golden light is      spread,    And thou unseen, enshrin'd in light, art singing      overhead.      Oh then thy happy song comes down upon the      glowing breast,    Soft as rich sunlight, on the flowers, comes from      the golden west:    And fain the heart would soar with thee, enshrin'd      in thought as sweet,    As the rich tones, which from thy heart, thou      dost in song repeat.      Oh there is not on earth a breast, but turns      with joy to thee.    From the cold wither'd years of age, to smiling      infancy.    Thou claimest smiles from ev'ry lip, and praise      from ev'ry tongue;    Such sympathy each happy heart finds in thy      joyous song.    _Dorking_.
