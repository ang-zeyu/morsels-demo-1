Guizot      Volume 1 (of 6)      EXTRACT FROM LETTER TO THE PUBLISHERS.    Every history, and especially that of France, is one vast, long drama, in  which events are linked together according to defined laws, and in which  the actors play parts not ready made and learned by heart, parts  depending, in fact, not only upon the accidents of their birth, but also  upon their own ideas and their own will.  There are, in the history of  peoples, two sets of causes essentially different, and, at the same time,  closely connected; the natural causes which are set over the general  course of events, and the unrestricted causes which are incidental.  Men  do not make the whole of history it has laws of higher origin; but, in  history, men are unrestricted agents who produce for it results and  exercise over it an influence for which they are responsible.  The fated  causes and the unrestricted causes, the defined laws of events and the  spontaneous actions of man's free agency--herein is the whole of history.  And in the faithful reproduction of these two elements consist the truth  and the moral of stories from it.    Never was I more struck with this two-fold character of history than in  my tales to my grandchildren.  When I commenced with them, they,  beforehand, evinced a lively interest, and they began to listen to me  with serious good will; but when they did not well apprehend the  lengthening chain of events, or when historical personages did not  become, in their eyes, creatures real and free, worthy of sympathy or  reprobation, when the drama was not developed before them with clearness  and animation, I saw their attention grow fitful and flagging; they  required light and life together; they wished to be illumined and  excited, instructed and amused.    At the same time that the difficulty of satisfying this two-fold desire  was painfully felt by me, I discovered therein more means and chances  than I had at first foreseen of succeeding in making my young audience  comprehend the history of France in its complication and its grandeur.  When Corneille observed,--    \"In the well-born soul Valor ne'er lingers till due seasons roll,\"--    he spoke as truly for intelligence as for valor.  When once awakened and  really attentive, young minds are more earnest and more capable of  complete comprehension than any one would suppose.  In order to explain  fully to my grandchildren the connection of events and the influence of  historical personages, I was sometimes led into very comprehensive  considerations and into pretty deep studies of character.  And in such  cases I was nearly always not only perfectly understood but keenly  appreciated.  I put it to the proof in the sketch of Charlemagne's reign  and character; and the two great objects of that great man, who succeeded  in one and failed in the other, received from my youthful audience the  most riveted attention and the most clear comprehension.  Youthful minds  have greater grasp than one is disposed to give them credit for, and,  perhaps, men would do well to be as earnest in their lives as children  are in their studies.    In order to attain the end I had set before me, I always took care to  connect my stories or my reflections with the great events or the great  personages of history.  When we wish to examine and describe a district  scientifically, we traverse it in all its divisions and in every  direction; we visit plains as well as mountains, villages as well as  cities, the most obscure corners as well as the most famous spots; this  is the way of proceeding with the geologist, the botanist, the  archeologist, the statistician, the scholar.  But when we wish  particularly to get an idea of the chief features of a country, its fixed  outlines, its general conformation, its special aspects, its great roads,  we mount the heights; we place ourselves at points whence we can best  take in the totality and the physiognomy of the landscape.  And so we  must proceed in history when we wish neither to reduce it to the skeleton  of an abridgment nor extend it to the huge dimensions of a learned work.  Great events and great men are the fixed points and the peaks of history;  and it is thence that we can observe it in its totality, and follow it  along its highways.  In my tales to my grandchildren I sometimes lingered  over some particular anecdote which gave me an opportunity of setting in  a vivid light the dominant spirit of an age or the characteristic manners  of a people; but, with rare exceptions, it is always on the great deeds  and the great personages of history that I have relied for making of them  in my tales what they were in reality--the centre and the focus of the  life of France.

CHAPTER I.----GAUL.    The Frenchman of to-day inhabits a country, long ago civilized and  Christianized, where, despite of much imperfection and much social  misery, thirty-eight millions of men live in security and peace, under  laws equal for all and efficiently upheld.  There is every reason to  nourish great hopes of such a country, and to wish for it more and more  of freedom, glory, and prosperity; but one must be just towards one's own  times, and estimate at their true value advantages already acquired and  progress already accomplished.  If one were suddenly carried twenty or  thirty centuries backward, into the midst of that which was then called  Gaul, one would not recognize France.  The same mountains reared their  heads; the same plains stretched far and wide; the same rivers rolled on  their course.  There is no alteration in the physical formation of the  country; but its aspect was very different.  Instead of the fields all  trim with cultivation, and all covered with various produce, one would  see inaccessible morasses and vast forests, as yet uncleared, given up to  the chances of primitive vegetation, peopled with wolves and bears, and  even the _urns_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11952"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"OF FRANCE    BY M.

CHAPTER XVII.----THE CRUSADES, THEIR DECLINE AND END.    In the month of August, 1099, the Crusade, to judge by appearances, had  attained its object.  Jerusalem was in the hands of the Christians, and  they had set up in it a king, the most pious and most disinterested of  the crusaders.  Close to this ancient kingdom were growing up likewise,  in the two chief cities of Syria and Mesopotamia, Antioch and Edessa, two  Christian principalities, in the possession of two crusader-chiefs,  Bohemond and Baldwin.  A third Christian principality was on the point of  getting founded at the foot of Libanus, at Tripolis, for the advantrge of  another crusader, Bertrand, eldest son of Count Raymond of Toulouse.  The  conquest of Syria and Palestine seemed accomplished, in the name of the  faith, and by the armies of Christian Europe; and the conquerors  calculated so surely upon their fixture that, during his reign, short as  it was (for he was elected king July 23, 1099, and died July 18, 1100,  aged only forty years), Godfrey de Bouillon caused to be drawn up and  published, under the title of Assizes of Jerusalem, a code of laws, which  transferred to Asia the customs and traditions of the feudal system, just  as they existed in France at the moment of his departure for the Holy  Land.    Forty-six years afterwards, in 1145, the Mussulmans, under the leadership  of Zanghi, sultan of Aleppo and of Mossoul, had retaken Edessa.  Forty-  two years after that, in 1187, Saladin (Salah-el-Eddyn), sultan of Egypt  and of Syria, had put an end to the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem; and  only seven years later, in 1194, Richard Coeur de Lion, king of England,  after the most heroic exploits in Palestine, on arriving in sight of  Jerusalem, retreated in despair, covering his eyes with his shield, and  saying that he was not worthy to look upon the city which he was not in a  condition to conquer.  When he re-embarked at St. Jean d'Acre, casting a  last glance and stretching out his arms towards the coast, he cried,  \"Most Holy Land, I commend thee to the care of the Almighty; and may He  grant me long life enough to return hither and deliver thee from the yoke  of the infidels!  \"A century had not yet rolled by since the triumph of  the first crusaders, and the dominion they had acquired by conquest in  the Holy Land had become, even in the eyes of their most valiant and most  powerful successors, an impossibility.    [Illustration: Richard's Farewell to the Holy Land----10]    Nevertheless, repeated efforts and glory, and even victories, were not  then, and were not to be still later, unknown amongst the Christians in  their struggle against the Mussulmans for the possession of the Holy  Land.  In the space of a hundred and seventy-one years from the  coronation of Godfrey de Bouillon as king of Jerusalem, in 1099, to the  death of St. Louis, wearing the cross before Tunis, in 1270, seven grand  crusades were undertaken with the same design by the greatest sovereigns  of Christian Europe; the Kings of France and England, the Emperors of  Germany, the King of Denmark, and princes of Italy successively engaged  therein.  And they all failed.  It were neither right nor desirable to  make long pause over the recital of their attempts and their reverses,  for it is the history of France, and not a general history of the  crusades, which is here related; but it was in France, by the French  people, and under French chiefs, that the crusades were begun; and it was  with St. Louis, dying before Tunis beneath the banner of the cross, that  they came to an end.  They received in the history of Europe the glorious  name of _Gesta Dei per Francos_ (God's works by French hands); and they  have a right to keep, in the history of France, the place they really  occupied.    During a reign of twenty-nine years, Louis VI., called the Fat, son of  Philip I., did not trouble himself about the East or the crusades, at  that time in all their fame and renown.  Being rather a man of sense than  an enthusiast in the cause either of piety or glory, he gave all his  attention to the establishment of some order, justice, and royal  authority in his as yet far from extensive kingdom.  A tragic incident,  however, gave the crusade chief place in the thoughts and life of his  son, Louis VII., called the Young, who succeeded him in 1137.  He got  himself rashly embroiled, in 1142, in a quarrel with Pope Innocent II.,  on the subject of the election of the Archbishop of Bourges.  The pope  and the king had each a different candidate for the see.  \"The king is a  child,\" said the pope; \"he must get schooling, and be kept from learning  bad habits.\"    \"Never, so long as I live,\" said the king, \"shall Peter de la Chatre (the  pope's candidate) enter the city of Bourges.\"  The chapter of Bourges,  thinking as the pope thought, elected Peter de la Chatre; and Theobald  II., Count of Champagne, took sides for the archbishop elect.  Mind your  own business,\" said the king to him; \"your dominions are large enough to  occupy you; and leave me to govern my own as I have a mind.\"  Theobald  persisted in backing the elect of pope and chapter.  The pope  excommunicated the king.  The king declared war against the Count of  Champagne; and went and besieged Vitry.  Nearly all the town was built of  wood, and the besiegers set fire to it.  The besieged fled for refuge to  a church, in which they were invested; and the fire reached the church,  which was entirely consumed, together with the thirteen hundred  inhabitants, men, women, and children, who had retreated thither.  This  disaster made a great stir.  St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux and the  leading ecclesiastical authority of the age, took the part of Count  Theobald.  King Louis felt a lively sorrow, and sincere repentance.  Soon  afterwards it became known in the West that the affairs of the Christians  were going ill in the East; that the town of Edessa had been re-taken by  the Turks, and all its inhabitants massacred.  The kingdom of Jerusalem,  too, was in danger.  Great was the emotion in Europe; and the cry of the  crusade was heard once more.  Louis the Young, to appease his troubled  conscience, and to get reconciled with the pope, to say nothing of  sympathy for the national movement, assembled the grandees, laic and  ecclesiastical, of the kingdom, to deliberate upon the matter.    Deliberation was more prolonged, more frequently repeated, and more  indecisive than it had been at the time of the first crusade.  Three  grand assemblies met, the first in 1145, at Bourges; the second in 1146,  at Vezelai, in Nivernais; and the third in 1147, at Etampes; all three  being called to investigate the expediency of a new crusade, and of the  king's participation in the enterprise.  Not only was the question  seriously discussed, but extremely diverse opinions were expressed, both  amongst the rank and file of these assemblies, and amongst their most  illustrious members.  There were two men whose talents and fame made them  conspicuous above all; Suger, Abbot of St. Denis, the intimate and able  adviser of the wise king, Louis the Fat, and St. Bernard, Abbot of  Clairvaux, the most eloquent, most influential, and most piously  disinterested amongst the Christians of his age.  Though both were  ecclesiastics, these two great men were, touching the second crusade,  of opposite opinions.  \"Let none suppose,\" says Suger's biographer and  confidant, William, monk of St. Denis, \"that it was at his instance or by  his counsel that the king undertook the voyage to the Holy Land.  Although the success of it was other than had been expected, this prince  was influenced only by pious "]]]
