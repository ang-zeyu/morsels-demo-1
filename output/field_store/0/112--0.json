MEMOIRS OF A CAVALIER    or    A Military Journal of the Wars in Germany, and the Wars in England.  From the Year 1632 to the Year 1648.    By Daniel Defoe    Edited with Introduction and Notes by Elizabeth O'Neill    1922          INTRODUCTION.      Daniel Defoe is, perhaps, best known to us as the author of _Robinson  Crusoe_, a book which has been the delight of generations of boys and  girls ever since the beginning of the eighteenth century. For it was  then that Defoe lived and wrote, being one of the new school of prose  writers which grew up at that time and which gave England new forms  of literature almost unknown to an earlier age. Defoe was a vigorous  pamphleteer, writing first on the Whig side and later for the Tories  in the reigns of William III and Anne. He did much to foster the  growth of the newspaper, a form of literature which henceforth became  popular. He also did much towards the development of the modern novel,  though he did not write novels in our sense of the word. His books  were more simple than is the modern novel. What he really wrote were  long stories told, as is _Robinson Crusoe_, in the first person and  with so much detail that it is hard to believe that they are works of  imagination and not true stories. \"The little art he is truly master  of, is of forging a story and imposing it upon the world as truth.\" So  wrote one of his contemporaries. Charles Lamb, in criticizing Defoe,  notices this minuteness of detail and remarks that he is, therefore,  an author suited only for \"servants\" (meaning that this method can  appeal only to comparatively uneducated minds). Really as every boy  and girl knows, a good story ought to have this quality of seeming  true, and the fact that Defoe can so deceive us makes his work the  more excellent reading.    The _Memoirs of a Cavalier_ resembles _Robinson Crusoe_ in so far as  it is a tale told by a man of his own experiences and adventures. It  has just the same air of truth and for a long time after its first  publication in 1720 people were divided in opinion as to whether it  was a book of real memoirs or not. A critical examination has shown  that it is Defoe's own work and not, as he declares, the contents of  a manuscript which he found \"by great accident, among other valuable  papers\" belonging to one of King William's secretaries of state.  Although his gifts of imagination enabled him to throw himself into  the position of the Cavalier he lapses occasionally into his own  characteristic prose and the style is often that of the eighteenth  rather than the seventeenth century, more eloquent than quaint. Again,  he is not careful to hide inconsistencies between his preface and the  text. Thus, he says in his preface that he discovered the manuscript  in 1651; yet we find in the _Memoirs_ a reference to the Restoration,  which shows that it must have been written after 1660 at least. There  is abundant proof that the book is really a work of fiction and that  the Cavalier is an imaginary character; but, in one sense, it is a  true history, inasmuch as the author has studied the events and spirit  of the time in which his scene is laid and, though he makes many  mistakes of detail, he gives us a very true picture of one of the most  interesting periods in English and European history. The _Memoirs_  thus represent the English historical novel in its beginnings, a much  simpler thing than it was to become in the hands of Scott and later  writers.    The period in which the scene is laid is that of the English Civil  War, in which the Cavalier fought on the side of King Charles I  against the Puritans. But his adventures in this war belong to the  second part of the book. In the first part, he tells of his birth and  parentage, the foreign travel which was the fashionable completion  of the education of a gentleman in the seventeenth century, and his  adventures as a volunteer officer in the Swedish army, where he gained  the experience which was to serve him well in the Civil War at home.  Many a real Cavalier must have had just such a career as Defoe's hero  describes as his own. After a short time at Oxford, \"long enough for  a gentleman,\" he embarked on a period of travel, going to Italy by  way of France. The Cavalier, however, devotes but little space to  description, vivid enough as far as it goes, of his adventures in  these two counties for a space of over two years. Italy, especially,  attracted the attention of gentlemen and scholars in those days,  but the Cavalier was more bent on soldiering than sightseeing and he  hurries on to tell of his adventures in Germany, where he first really  took part in warfare, becoming a volunteer officer in the army of  Gustavus Adolphus, the hero King of Sweden, and where he met with  those adventures the story of which forms the bulk of the first part  of the _Memoirs_.    To appreciate the tale, it will be necessary to have a clear idea  of the state of affairs in Europe at the time. The war which was  convulsing Germany, and in which almost every other European power  interfered at some time, was the Thirty Years' War (1618--1648), a  struggle having a special character of its own as the last of the  religious wars which had torn Europe asunder for a century and the  first of a long series of wars in which the new and purely political  principle of the Balance of Power can be seen at work. The struggle  was, nominally, between Protestant and Catholic Germany for, during  the Reformation period, Germany, which consisted of numerous states  under the headship of the Emperor, had split into two great camps. The  Northern states had become Protestant under their Protestant princes.  The Southern states had remained, for the most part, Catholic or had  been won back to Catholicism in the religious reaction known as the  Counter-Reformation. As the Catholic movement spread, under a Catholic  Emperor like Ferdinand of Styria, who was elected in 1619, it was  inevitable that the privileges granted to Protestants should be  curtailed. They determined to resist and, as the Emperor had the  support of Spain, the Protestant Union found it necessary to call in  help from outside. Thus it was that the other European powers came to  interfere in German affairs. Some helped the Protestants from motives  of religion, more still from considerations of policy, and the long  struggle of thirty years may be divided into marked periods in which  one power after another, Denmark, Sweden, France, allied themselves  with the Protestants against the Emperor. The _Memoirs_ are  concerned with the first two years of the Swedish period of the war  (1630--1634), during which Gustavus Adolphus almost won victory  for the Protestants who were, however, to lose the advantage of his  brilliant generalship through his death at the battle of Luetzen in  1632. Through the death of \"this conquering king,\" the Swedes lost the  fruits of their victory and the battle of Luetzen marks the end of what  may be termed the heroic period of the war. Gustavus Adolphus stands  out among the men of his day for the loftiness of his character as  well as for the genius of his generalship. It is, therefore, fitting  enough that Defoe should make his Cavalier withdraw from the Swedish  service after the death of the \"glorious king\" whom he \"could never  mention without some remark of his extraordinary merit.\" For two years  longer, he wanders through Germany still watching the course of the  war and then returns to England, soon to take part in another war at  home, namely the Civil War, in which the English people were divided  into two great parties according as they supported King Charles I or  the members of the Long Parliament who opposed him. According to the  _Memoirs_, the Cavalier \"went into arms\" without troubling himself \"to  examine sides.\" Defoe probably considered this attitude as typical  of many of the Cavalier party, and, of course, loyalty to the king's  person was one of their strongest motives. The Cavalier does not enter  largely into the causes of the war. What he gives us is a picture of  army life in that troubled period. It will be well, however, to bear  in mind the chief facts in the history of the times.    From the beginning of his reign, Charles had had trouble with his  parliaments, which had already become very restless under James I.  Charles's parliaments disapproved of his foreign policy and their  unwillingness to grant subsidies led him to fall back on questionable  methods of raising money, especially during the eleven years  (1629--1640) in which he ruled without a parliament. Charles had no  great scheme of tyranny, but avoided parliaments because of their  criticism of his policy. At first the opposition had been purely  political, but the parliament of 1629 had attacked also Charles's  religious policy. He favoured the schemes of Laud (archbishop of  Canterbury 1633--1649) and the Arminian school among the clergy, who  wished to revive many of the old Catholic practices and some of the  beliefs which had been swept away by the Reformation. Many people  in England objected not only to these but even to the wearing of the  surplice, the simplest of the old vestments, on the use of which Laud  tried to insist. This party came to be known as Puritans and they  formed the chief strength of the opposition to the King in the Long  Parliament which met in 1640. For their attack on the Church led many  who had at first opposed the King's arbitrary methods to go over to  his side. Thus, the moderate men as well as the loyalists formed a  king's party and the opposition was almost confined to men who hated  the Church as much as the King. The Puritans who loved simplicity  of dress and severity of manners and despised the flowing locks and  worldly vanities which the Cavaliers loved were, by these, nicknamed  Roundheads on account of their short hair.

THE JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY    HYSTERIA AS A WEAPON IN MARITAL CONFLICTS    BY A. MYERSON, M.D.    Clinical Director and Pathologist, Taunton State Hospital Taunton State  Hospital Papers, 1914-5    THE progress in our understanding of hysteria has come largely through the  elaboration of the so-called mechanisms by which the symptoms arise.  These  mechanisms have been declared to reside or to have their origin in the  subconsciousness or coconsciousness. The mechanisms range all the way from  the conception of Janet that the personality is disintegrated owing to  lowering of the psychical tension to that of Freud, who conceives all  hysterical symptoms as a result of dissociation arising through conflicts  between repressed sexual desires and experiences and the various censors  organized by the social life. Without in any way intending to set up any  other general mechanism or to enter into the controversy raging concerning  the Freudian mechanism, which at present is the storm center, the writer  reports a case in which the origin of the symptoms can be traced to a more  simple and fairly familiar mechanism, one which, in its essence, is merely  an intensification of a normal reaction of many women to marital  difficulties. In other words, women frequently resort to measures which  bring about an acute discomfort upon the part of their mate, through his  pity, compassion and self-accusation. They resort to tears as their  proverbial weapon for gaining their point. In this case the hysterical  symptoms seem to have been the substitute for tears in a domestic battle.    Case History--Patient is a woman, aged thirty-eight, of American birth and  ancestry.  Family history is negative so far as mental disease is concerned,  but there seems to have been a decadence of stock as manifested in the  steady dropping of her family in the social scale. She is one of two  children, there being a brother, who, from all accounts, is a fairly  industrious, but poverty-stricken farmer.  Her early childhood was spent in  a small village in Massachusetts.  She received but little education,  largely because she had no desire to study and no aptitude for learning,  although she is by no means feeble-minded. The menstrual periods started at  fourteen, and have been without any noteworthy accompanying phenomena ever  since.  History is negative so far as other diseases are concerned. She  worked as a domestic and in factories until she was married for the first  time at the age of twenty.  She had no children by this marriage. It is  stated on good authority that she took preventive measures against  conception and if pregnant induced abortion by drugs and mechanical  measures. At the end of eight years there was a divorce.  Just which one of  the partners was at fault is impossible to state, but that there was more  than mere incompatibility is evident by the reticence of all concerned.  Shortly afterward, she married her present husband with whom she has lived  for about nine years.  He is a steady drinker, but is a good workman, has  never been discharged, and, apparently, his drinking habits do not interfere  with the main tenor of his life.  He lives with the patient in a small house  of which they occupy two garret rooms, meagerly furnished, though without  evidence of dire poverty.    From her fifteenth year the patient has been subject to fainting spells.  By  all accounts they come on usually after quarrels, disagreements or  disappointments.  They are not accompanied by blanching, by clonic or tonic  movements of any kind, they last for uncertain periods ranging from five  minutes to an hour or more, and consciousness does not seem to be totally  lost. In addition she has vomiting spells, these likewise occurring when  balked in her desires.  She is subject to headaches, usually on one half of  the head, but frequently frontal. There is no regular period of occurrence  of these headaches except that there is also some relation to quarrels, etc.  On several occasions the patient has lost her voice for short periods  ranging from a few minutes to several hours following particularly stormy  domestic scenes.    On July 29 of this year she was suddenly paralyzed. That is to say, she was  unable to move the right arm, the right leg, the right side of the face, and  she lost the power of speech entirely; there was complete aphonia.  This  \"stroke\" was not accompanied by unconsciousness, but was preceded by severe  headache and much nausea.  During the three weeks that followed she remained  in bed, recovering only the function of the arm. Her husband fed her by  forcing"]]]
