With Photographs and Diagrams.      EDITED BY  CAMPBELL P. OGILVIE.      LONDON:  WERTHEIMER, LEA & CO.,  CLIFTON HOUSE, WORSHIP STREET, E.C  1910.      PRINTED BY WERTHEIMER, LEA & CO., CLIFTON HOUSE, WORSHIP STREET, LONDON,  E.C      DEDICATED To _all_ THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE SANTA FE LAND COMPANY,  LIMITED, _who take a real interest in the Company_.          PREFACE.      In May last I was asked to read, towards the end of the year, a paper on  Argentina, before the Royal Society of Arts. The task of compiling that  paper was one of absorbing interest to me; and though I fully realise  how inadequately I have dealt with so interesting a subject, I venture  to think that the facts and figures which the paper contains may be of  interest to some, at any rate, of the Shareholders of the Santa Fe Land  Company. It is upon this supposition that it is published.    Whilst I was obtaining the latest information for the paper (which was  read before the Royal Society of Arts on November 30th, 1910), several  members of the staff of the Santa Fe Land Company aided me by writing  some useful and interesting notes on subjects connected with Argentina,  and also giving various experiences which they had undergone whilst  resident there. I am indebted to the writers for many hints on life in  Argentina, and as I think that others will find the reading of the notes  as engaging as I did, they are now reproduced just as I received them,  and incorporated with my own paper in a book of which they form by no  means the least interesting part.    The final portion of the book--Leaves from a journal entitled \"The  Tacuru\"--is written in a lighter vein. It describes a trip through some  of the Northern lands of the Santa Fe Land Company, and it is included  because, although frankly humorous, it contains much really useful  information and many capital illustrations, I should, however, mention  that this journal was written by members of the expedition, and was  originally intended solely for their own private edification and  amusement; therefore all the happier phases of the trip are noted; but I  can assure my English readers that the trip, well though it was planned,  was not all luxury.    To the many who have helped me in this work I tender my most sincere  thanks.    CAMPBELL P. OGILVIE.         LAWFORD PLACE,          MANNINGTREE, ESSEX,              _December, 1910_.

Argentina, which does not profess to be a manufacturing country,  exported in 1909 material grown on her own lands to the value of  L79,000,000, and imported goods to the extent of L60,000,000. This fact  arrests our attention, and forces us to recognise that there is a trade  balance of nearly 20 millions sterling in her favour, and to realise the  saving power of the country.    It is not mere curiosity which prompts us to ask: \"Are these L79,000,000  worth of exports of any value to us? Do we consume any of them? Do we  manufacture any of them? And do we send any of this same stuff back  again after it has been dealt with by our British artisans?\" It would be  difficult to follow definitely any one article, but upon broad lines the  questions are simple and can be easily answered. Amongst the  agricultural exports we find wheat, oats, maize, linseed, and flour. The  value placed upon these in 1908 amounted to L48,000,000, and England  pays for and consumes nearly 42 per cent. of these exports. Other goods,  such as frozen beef, chilled beef, mutton, pork, wool, and articles  which may be justly grouped as the results of the cattle and sheep  industry, amounted to no less a figure than L23,000,000. All these  exports represent foodstuffs or other necessities of life, and are  consumed by those nations which do not produce enough from their own  soil to keep their teeming populations. Another export which is worthy  of particular mention comes from the forests, viz., quebracho, which, in  the form of logs and extract, was exported in 1908 to the value of  L1,200,000. The value of material of all sorts sent from England to  Argentina in 1908 was L16,938,872 (this figure includes such things as  manufactured woollen goods, leather goods, oils, and paints), therefore  it is clear that we have, and must continue to take, a practical and  financial interest in the welfare and prosperity of Argentina.    New countries cannot get on without men willing and ready to exploit  Nature's gifts, and, naturally, we look to the immigration returns when  considering Argentina's progress. To give each year's return for the  last 50 years would be wearisome, but, taking the average figures for  ten-year periods from 1860 to 1909, we have the following interesting  table. (The figures represent the balance of those left in the country  after allowing for emigration):--                                      Yearly Average.  From 1860 to 1869 (inclusive)   ...  15,044    \"  1870  \" 1879   \"           ...  29,462    \"  1880  \" 1889   \"           ...  84,586    \"  1890  \" 1899   \"           ...  43,618    \"  1900  \" 1909   \"           ... 100,998    Sixty-five per cent. of the immigrants are agricultural labourers, who  soon find work in the country, and again add their quota to the  increasing quantity and value of materials to be exported. Facing this  page is a diagram of the Immigration Returns from 1857 to 1909.    Nature has been lavish in her gifts to Argentina, and man has taken  great advantage of these gifts. My desire now is to show what has been  done in the way of developing agriculture in this richly-endowed country  during the last fifty years.

New York  1943                SPECIAL INTRODUCTION      Among the absurd notions as to what the Talmud was, given credence in  the Middle Ages, one was that it was a man! The mediaeval priest or  peasant was perhaps wiser than he knew. Almost, might we say, the Talmud  was Man, for it is a record of the doings, the beliefs, the usages, the  hopes, the sufferings, the patience, the humor, the mentality, and the  morality of the Jewish people for half a millennium.    What is the Talmud? There is more than one answer. Ostensibly it is the  _corpus juris_ of the Jews from about the first century before the  Christian era to about the fourth after it. But we shall see as we  proceed that the Talmud was much more than this. The very word \"Law\" in  Hebrew--\"Torah\"--means more than its translation would imply. The Jew  interpreted his whole religion in terms of law. It is his name in fact  for the Bible's first five books--the Pentateuch. To explain what the  Talmud is we must first explain the theory of its growth more remarkable  perhaps than the work itself. What was that theory? The Divine Law was  revealed to Moses, not only through the Commands that were found written  in the Bible, but also through all the later rules and regulations of  post-exilic days. These additional laws it was presumed were handed down  orally from Moses to Joshua, thence to the Prophets, and later still  transmitted to the Scribes, and eventually to the Rabbis. The reason why  the Rabbis ascribed to Moses the laws that they later evolved, was due  to their intense reverence for Scripture, and their modest sense of  their own authority and qualification. \"If the men of old were giants  then we are pigmies,\" said they. They felt and believed that all duty  for the guidance of man was found in the Bible either directly or  inferentially. Their motto was then, \"Search the Scriptures,\" and they  did search them with a literalness and a painstaking thoroughness never  since repeated. Not a word, not a letter escaped them. Every redundancy  of expression was freighted with meaning, every repetition was made to  give birth to new truth. Some of the inferences were logical and  natural, some artificial and far-fetched, but all ingenious. Sometimes  the method was inductive and sometimes deductive. That is, occasionally  a needed law was promulgated by the Jewish Sanhedrin, and then its  authority sought in the Scripture, or the Scripture would be sought in  the first instance to reveal new law.    So while the Jewish code, religious and civil, continued to grow during  the era of the Restoration of the second Temple, to meet the more  complex conditions of later times, still the theory was maintained that  all was evolved from original Scripture and always transmitted, either  written or oral, from Moses from Mount Sinai. It was not, however, till  the year 219 after the Christian era that a compiled summary of the  so-called oral law was made--perhaps compiled from earlier summaries--by  Rabbi Jehudah Hanassi (the Prince), and the added work was called the  Mishnah or Second Law. Mark the date. We have passed the period of the  fall of Judea's nationality. And it was these very academies in which  the Jewish tradition--the Jewish Law was studied, that kept alive the  Jewish people as a religious community after they had ceased to be a  nation. This Mishnah, divided into six _sedarim_ or chapters, and  subdivided into thirty-six treatises, became now in the academies of  Palestine, and later in Babylonia, the text of further legal  elaboration, with the theory of deduction from Scripture still  maintained.    Although the life of denationalized Israel was much narrower and more  circumscribed, with fewer outlets to their capacities, nevertheless the  new laws deduced from the Mishnah code in the academies grew far larger  than the original source, while the discussions which grew around each  Halacha, as the final decision was termed, and which was usually  transmitted with the decision, grew so voluminous that it became  gradually impossible to retain the complex tradition in the  memory--remarkable as the Oriental memory was and is. That fact, added  to the growing persecutions from Israel's over-lords, and the consequent  precarious fate of these precious traditions, made it necessary to write  them down in spite of the prejudice against committing the oral law to  writing at all. This work was undertaken by Rav Asche and his disciples,  and was completed before the year 500. The Mishnah, together with the  laws that later grew out of it, called also Gamara, or Commentary, form  the Talmud. While the Palestinian school evolved a Gamara from the  Mishnah which is called the \"Palestinian Talmud,\" it was the tradition  of the Babylonian academies, far vaster because they continued for so  many more centuries, that is the Talmud _per se_, that great work of  2,947 folio leaves. Were we to continue the tradition further, we might  show how often this vast legal compilation was the subject of further  commentary, discussion and deduction by yet later scholars. But that  takes us beyond our theme and is another story.    In forming an estimate of these laws, we must first remember that they  belonged to the days when religion and state were one. So we shall find  priestly laws mixed up with police laws, sanitary regulations side by  side with regulations of sanctity, the injunctions teaching political  economy and morality almost in the same line. It should rather then be  compared to codes of law than to religious scriptures, though often  there the comparison would be incomplete, since the religious atmosphere  pervaded even the most secular circumstance of the life of the Jew.  There was no secular. The meanest function in life must be brought in  relation to the great Divine. This must be understood in studying the  Talmud, this must be understood in studying the Jew. As law, it compares  favorably with the Roman code--its contemporary in part. In the  treatment of a criminal it is almost quixotically humane. It abhors the  shedding of blood, and no man can be put to death on circumstantial  evidence. Many of its injunctions are intensely minute and  hair-splitting to the extreme of casuistry. Yet these elements are  familiar in the interpretation of law, not only in the olden time, but  in some measure even to-day. There are instances where Talmudic law is  tenderer than the Biblical; for example, the _lex talionis_ is softened  into an equivalent.    Yet the legal does not form the whole of the Talmud, nor perhaps the  part that would most interest the casual reader or the world at large.  It is the dry, prosaic half. There is a poetic half, let us say a  homiletic half, what we call Agada, as distinct from the legal portion  called Halacha. The term Agada, \"narrative,\" is wofully insufficient to  describe the diverse material that falls under this head, for it  comprehends all the discursive elements that come up in the legal  discussions in the old Babylonian and Palestinian academies. These  elements are occasionally biographical,--fragments of the lives of the  great scholars, occasionally historical,--little bits of Israel's long  tragedy, occasionally didactic,--facts, morals, life lessons taught by  the way; occasionally anecdotic, stories told to relieve the monotony of  discussion; not infrequently fanciful; bits of philosophy, old  folk-lore, weird imaginings, quaint beliefs, superstitions and humor.  They are presented haphazard, most irrelevantly introduced in between  the complex discussions, breaking the thread that however is never lost,  but always taken up again.    From this point of view the Talmud is a great maze and apparently the  simplest roads lead off into strange, winding by-paths. It is hard to  deduce any distinct system of ethics, any consistent philosophy, any  coherent doctrine. Yet patience rewards the student here too, and from  this confused medley of material, he can build the intellectual world of  the early mediaeval Jew. In the realm of doctrine we find that \"original  sin,\" \"vicarious atonement,\" and \"everlasting punishment,\" are denied.  Man is made the author of his own salvation. Life beyond the grave is  still progressive; the soul is pre-existent.    A suggestion of the wit and wisdom of the Talmud may be gathered from  the following quotations:--      A single light answers as well for a hundred men as for one.    The ass complains of cold even in July.    A myrtle in the desert remains a myrtle.    Teach thy tongue to say, \"I do not know.\"    Hospitality is an expression of Divine worship.    Thy friend has a friend, and thy friend's friend has a friend;      be discreet.    Attend no auctions if thou hast no money.    Rather flay a carcass, than be idly dependent on charity.    The place honors not the man, 'tis the man who gives honor to the place.    Drain not the waters of thy well while other people may desire them.    The rose grows among thorns.    Two pieces of coin in one bag make more noise than a hundred.    The rivalry of scholars advances science.    Truth is heavy, therefore few care to carry it.    He who is loved by man is loved by God.    Use thy noble vase to-day; to-morrow it may break.    The soldiers fight and the kings are heroes.    Commit a sin twice, it will seem a sin no longer.    The world is saved by the breath of the school children.    A miser is as wicked as an idolater.    Do not make woman weep, for God counts her tears.    The best preacher is the heart; the best teacher time;      the best book the world; the best friend God.    The philosophy in the Talmud, rather than the philosophy of it, has been  made the subject of separate treatment just as the whole of the Agada  has been drawn out of the Talmud and published as a separate work.
