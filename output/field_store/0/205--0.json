[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#1)"],[1,"TALISMAN    By Sir Walter Scott          INTRODUCTION TO THE TALISMAN.    The \"Betrothed\" did not greatly please one or two friends, who thought  that it did not well correspond to the general title of \"The Crusaders.\"  They urged, therefore, that, without direct allusion to the manners of  the Eastern tribes, and to the romantic conflicts of the period, the  title of a \"Tale of the Crusaders\" would resemble the playbill, which  is said to have announced the tragedy of Hamlet, the character of  the Prince of Denmark being left out. On the other hand, I felt the  difficulty of giving a vivid picture of a part of the world with which  I was almost totally unacquainted, unless by early recollections of  the Arabian Nights' Entertainments; and not only did I labour under the  incapacity of ignorance--in which, as far as regards Eastern manners, I  was as thickly wrapped as an Egyptian in his fog--but my contemporaries  were, many of them, as much enlightened upon the subject as if they had  been inhabitants of the favoured land of Goshen. The love of travelling  had pervaded all ranks, and carried the subjects of Britain into all  quarters of the world. Greece, so attractive by its remains of art, by  its struggles for freedom against a Mohammedan tyrant, by its very name,  where every fountain had its classical legend--Palestine, endeared  to the imagination by yet more sacred remembrances--had been of late  surveyed by British eyes, and described by recent travellers. Had I,  therefore, attempted the difficult task of substituting manners of my  own invention, instead of the genuine costume of the East, almost every  traveller I met who had extended his route beyond what was anciently  called \"The Grand Tour,\" had acquired a right, by ocular inspection, to  chastise me for my presumption. Every member of the Travellers' Club who  could pretend to have thrown his shoe over Edom was, by having done so,  constituted my lawful critic and corrector. It occurred, therefore,  that where the author of Anastasius, as well as he of Hadji Baba, had  described the manners and vices of the Eastern nations, not only with  fidelity, but with the humour of Le Sage and the ludicrous power of  Fielding himself, one who was a perfect stranger to the subject must  necessarily produce an unfavourable contrast. The Poet Laureate also,  in the charming tale of \"Thalaba,\" had shown how extensive might be  the researches of a person of acquirements and talent, by dint of  investigation alone, into the ancient doctrines, history, and manners of  the Eastern countries, in which we are probably to look for the cradle  of mankind; Moore, in his \"Lalla Rookh,\" had successfully trod the  same path; in which, too, Byron, joining ocular experience to extensive  reading, had written some of his most attractive poems. In a word, the  Eastern themes had been already so successfully handled by those who  were acknowledged to be masters of their craft, that I was diffident of  making the attempt.    These were powerful objections; nor did they lose force when they  became the subject of anxious reflection, although they did not finally  prevail. The arguments on the other side were, that though I had no hope  of rivalling the contemporaries whom I have mentioned, yet it occurred  to me as possible to acquit myself of the task I was engaged in without  entering into competition with them.    The period relating more immediately to the Crusades which I at last  fixed upon was that at which the warlike character of Richard I., wild  and generous, a pattern of chivalry, with all its extravagant virtues,  and its no less absurd errors, was opposed to that of Saladin, in which  the Christian and English monarch showed all the cruelty and violence  of an Eastern sultan, and Saladin, on the other hand, displayed the deep  policy and prudence of a European sovereign, whilst each contended  which should excel the other in the knightly qualities of bravery and  generosity. This singular contrast afforded, as the author conceived,  materials for a work of fiction possessing peculiar interest. One of the  inferior characters introduced was a supposed relation of Richard Coeur  de Lion--a violation of the truth of history which gave offence to Mr.  Mills, the author of the \"History of Chivalry and the Crusades,\" who was  not, it may be presumed, aware that romantic fiction naturally includes  the power of such invention, which is indeed one of the requisites of  the art.    Prince David of Scotland, who was actually in the host, and was the hero  of some very romantic adventures on his way home, was also pressed into  my service, and constitutes one of my DRAMATIS PERSONAE.    It is true I had already brought upon the field him of the lion heart.  But it was in a more private capacity than he was here to be exhibited  in the Talisman--then as a disguised knight, now in the avowed character  of a conquering monarch; so that I doubted not a name so dear to  Englishmen as that of King Richard I. might contribute to their  amusement for more than once.    I had access to all which antiquity believed, whether of reality or  fable, on the subject of that magnificent warrior, who was the proudest  boast of Europe and their chivalry, and with whose dreadful name the  Saracens, according to a historian of their own country, were wont to  rebuke their startled horses. \"Do you think,\" said they, \"that King  Richard is on the track, that you stray so wildly from it?\" The most  curious register of the history of King Richard is an ancient romance,  translated originally from the Norman; and at first certainly having a  pretence to be termed a work of chivalry, but latterly becoming stuffed  with the most astonishing and monstrous fables. There is perhaps no  metrical romance upon record where, along with curious and genuine  history, are mingled more absurd and exaggerated incidents. We have  placed in the Appendix to this Introduction the passage of the romance  in which Richard figures as an ogre, or literal cannibal.    A principal incident in the story is that from which the title is  derived. Of all people who ever lived, the Persians were perhaps most  remarkable for their unshaken credulity in amulets, spells, periapts,  and similar charms, framed, it was said, under the influence of  particular planets, and bestowing high medical powers, as well as the  means of advancing men's fortunes in various manners. A story of this  kind, relating to a Crusader of eminence, is often told in the west of  Scotland, and the relic alluded to is still in existence, and even yet  held in veneration.    Sir Simon Lockhart of Lee and Gartland made a considerable figure in the  reigns of Robert the Bruce and of his son David. He was one of the chief  of that band of Scottish chivalry who accompanied James, the Good Lord  Douglas, on his expedition to the Holy Land with the heart of King  Robert Bruce. Douglas, impatient to get at the Saracens, entered into  war with those of Spain, and was killed there. Lockhart proceeded to the  Holy Land with such Scottish knights as had escaped the fate of their  leader and assisted for some time in the wars against the Saracens.    The following adventure is said by tradition to have befallen him:--    He made prisoner in battle an Emir of considerable wealth and  consequence. The aged mother of the captive came to the Christian camp,  to redeem her son from his state of captivity. Lockhart is said to have  fixed the price at which his prisoner should ransom himself; and the  lady, pulling out a large embroidered purse, proceeded to tell down the  ransom, like a mother who pays little respect to gold in comparison of  her son's liberty. In this operation, a pebble inserted in a coin, some  say of the Lower Empire, fell out of the purse, and the Saracen matron  testified so much haste to recover it as gave the Scottish knight a  high idea of its value, when compared with gold or silver. \"I will not  consent,\" he said, \"to grant your son's liberty, unless that amulet be  added to his ransom.\" The lady not only consented to this, but explained  to Sir Simon Lockhart the mode in which the talisman was to be used,  and the uses to which it might be put. The water in which it was dipped  operated as a styptic, as a febrifuge, and possessed other properties as  a medical talisman.    Sir Simon Lockhart, after much experience of the wonders which it  wrought, brought it to his own country, and left it to his heirs, by  whom, and by Clydesdale in general, it was, and is still, distinguished  by the name of the Lee-penny, from the name of his native seat of Lee.    The most remarkable part of its history, perhaps, was that it so  especially escaped condemnation when the Church of Scotland chose to  impeach many other cures which savoured of the miraculous, as occasioned  by sorcery, and censured the appeal to them, \"excepting only that to  the amulet, called the Lee-penny, to which it had pleased God to annex  certain healing virtues which the Church did not presume to condemn.\" It  still, as has been said, exists, and its powers are sometimes resorted  to. Of late, they have been chiefly restricted to the cure of persons  bitten by mad dogs; and as the illness in such cases frequently arises  from imagination, there can be no reason for doubting that water which  has been poured on the Lee-penny furnishes a congenial cure.    Such is the tradition concerning the talisman, which the author has  taken the liberty to vary in applying it to his own purposes.    Considerable liberties have also been taken with the truth of history,  both with respect to Conrade of Montserrat's life, as well as his death.  That Conrade, however, was reckoned the enemy of Richard is agreed both  in history and romance. The general opinion of the terms upon which they  stood may be guessed from the proposal of the Saracens that the Marquis  of Montserrat should be invested"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#1)"],[1,"STEP IN CANNING    The Cold-Pack Method    by    GRACE VIALL GRAY, PH.B., ED.B    Formerly Associate Professor of Home Economics,  Iowa State College    1920                PREFACE      It was six years ago that I first heard of the One Period, Cold-Pack  Method of canning. A little circular was put in my hand one day at a  federated club meeting announcing the fact that in a few weeks there  would be a cold-pack demonstration about fifty miles away. Immediately  I announced that I was going to the demonstrations. So leaving my  small daughter with my mother, I went to the Normal School at DeKalb,  Illinois, and heard and saw for the first time cold-pack canning.    It is sufficient to say that those three days were so crowded full of  interest and new messages on the gospel of canning that I felt amply  repaid for going fifty miles. As a result of that trip, the first  story ever published on cold-pack canning appeared in _The Country  Gentleman_ and I had the pleasure of writing it. So enthused was I  over this new, efficient and easy way to can not only fruits but hard  vegetables, such as peas, corn and beans, that I wanted to carry the  good news into the kitchen of other busy housewives and mothers.    My mother had insisted that I take with me my younger sister, just  from college, but with no domestic science tendencies. So, much  against her wishes, preferring rather to do some settlement work, my  sister went with me. The canning was so interesting that for the first  time in her life, my sister became enthusiastic over one phase of  cooking. My mother was so pleased at this zeal that when she received  my sister's letter written from DeKalb, saying, \"Mother, I am  enthused about this canning and want to can everything in sight this  summer,\" she hastily washed all available glass jars and tops and had  everything in readiness for young daughter's return. And we canned. We  were not content to can alone but invited all the neighbors in and  taught them how to can. Our community canned more things and more  unusual things, including the hard vegetables, that year than they had  ever attempted before.    Do not think for one minute it was all easy sailing, for there were  doubting Thomases, but it only took time and _results_ to convert even  the most skeptical ones. And here I must make a confession. It was  much easier for my sister, unversed in any phase of canning, to master  this new method than it was for me with my four years' training course  and my five years of teaching canning behind me. And this is the  reason. She had nothing to \"unlearn,\" she knew no other method whereas  I had to \"unlearn\" all my previous methods.    The one period, cold-pack method is so entirely different from the old  hot pack or open kettle method that to be successful you must forget  all you ever knew and be willing to be taught anew. And right here is  where many women \"fall down\"--they are not willing to admit that they  know nothing about it and so do not get accurate information about it.  They are so afraid of appearing ignorant. This false feeling is the  greatest obstacle in woman's way.    I still go into small towns on my lecture trips and women will say,  \"Oh, that cold-pack canning isn't new to me. I have used it for thirty  years.\" And when I show my surprise, they further enlighten me with,  \"and my mother used it before me, too.\" With a little tactful  questioning I usually get these answers: \"Of course, I do not hot dip  and cold dip. I never heard of that before. I pack the products into  the cold jars and for all vegetables I use a preserving powder because  there is no way on earth to keep corn and peas and such things unless  you put something into them to keep them. Fruit will keep all right.  Then I cook them in my wash boiler until they are done.\" And when I  ask, \"How do you know when they are done,\" I invariably get the  answer, \"Oh, I take out a jar once in a while and try it.\" It seems  like such a hopeless task to change all these old-fashioned,  out-of-date methods of cooking but with a great amount of patience and  much actual canning it can usually be done. Not always, of course, for  there are some women who seem to delight in sticking to the old rather  than try the new.    The present book is therefore designed for all interested in greater  efficiency in the home, including not only students of home economics  but all persons who have charge of homes and are interested in  learning new, efficient, time and labor saving methods.    In the preparation of this book I have received much help from Mr.  O.H. Benson, Agriculturist in charge of the government Boys' and  Girls' Club Work, and my first instructor in Cold-Pack Canning. I also  wish to acknowledge my appreciation to those who have helped to make  this book possible by contributing information, advice and  encouragement.    GRACE VIALL GRAY.

HOW TO MARKET HOME CANNED PRODUCE            EVERY STEP IN CANNING          CHAPTER I    GETTING READY TO CAN      Before the World War, housewives had lost the good habit of canning,  preserving and pickling. It was easier to buy California fruits by the  case and canned vegetables by the dozen or half dozen cans, according  to the size of the family. There is no doubt it was cheaper and  decidedly easier to purchase canned fruits, vegetables, greens, soups  and meats than to take time and strength in the very hottest season of  the year to do our own canning.    But what was true then is not true now. The war taught us thrift. The  crime of wasting even a few tomatoes or berries has sunk into our  minds to stay forever; scientific canning methods have been adopted by  the modern woman. Women who had never canned in days before the war  had to can during war days. Food was so scarce and so high in price  that to buy fancy or even plain canned products was a severe strain on  the average housewife's purse. The American woman, as was to be  expected, came quickly and eagerly to the front with the solution and  the slogan: \"More gardens and more canning and preserving at home.\"    A great garden and canning movement swept the whole country. As I have  just said, women who had never canned before became vitally interested  in putting up not merely a few jars of this and that, but jars upon  jars of canned fruits, vegetables and greens; and so great was their  delight in the finished products that again and again I heard them  say: \"Never again shall we depend upon the grocery to supply us with  canned goods.\"    If these women had been obliged to use the same methods that their  grandmothers used before them, they would have canned just the same,  because it was their patriotic duty to do so; but they would have  canned without the enthusiasm and zeal that was so apparent during the  summers of 1917 and 1918. This enthusiasm was a result of new canning  methods, methods unknown to our grandmothers. The women of to-day were  forced into a new field and learned how satisfying and well worth  while the results were. It is safe to guarantee that every  home-canning recruit will become a home-canning veteran.    The fascination of doing one's own canning after one has learned how  simple and economical it is will be lasting. No one need fear that  home canning is going to suffer because the war ended the immediate  necessity for it. Home canning has come into its own because of the  war, and it has come to stay because of its many merits.    There are four methods of canning that are employed by women all over  the United States. They are the \"open-kettle,\" the \"intermittent,\" the  \"cold-water\" and the \"cold-pack\" methods.      DRAWBACKS OF THE OLD METHODS    The \"open-kettle,\" or \"hot-pack,\" method is the oldest. It was largely  used in the pre-war days. The food is completely cooked in the  preserving kettle, and is then packed into hot, sterilized jars, after  which the jars are sealed. As the packing into the jar is done after  the sterilization has been completed, there is always a possibility of  bacteria and spores entering the jar with the cooked food and the air.  Fruits can be handled successfully in this way, but this method cannot  be used for vegetables, greens and meats. It is a very laborious, hot  and hard way to can. Modern housewives are discarding it more and more  every year and are beginning to place their trust in the newer and far  more scientific methods of canning.    The \"intermittent,\" or fractional sterilization, method is still  beloved by some people who cling to the sure and hate to venture into  the new. Vegetables can be handled by this method as can all fruits  and meats. It is used rather extensively in the South, where they say  the conditions do not favor \"cold-pack.\" The great objection to this  method of canning is that it requires three periods of sterilization  on three different days and three liftings of jars in and out of the  sterilizer.    What is sometimes called the \"cold-water\" method of canning should not  be confused with the \"cold-pack\" method. The \"cold-water\" is often  used in connection with the canning of rhubarb, green gooseberries and  a comparatively few other sour berry fruits. If the \"cold-water\"  method is used we would suggest that the product be"]]]
