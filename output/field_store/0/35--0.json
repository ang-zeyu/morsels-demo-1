ALTAMIRANO]      LA NAVIDAD EN LAS MONTAÑAS    A SPANISH AMERICAN STORY    BY    IGNACIO MANUEL ALTAMIRANO    _WITH INTRODUCTION, NOTES, AND VOCABULARY_    BY    EDITH A. HILL    UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS    AND    MARY JOY LOMBARD    HIGH SCHOOL, REDLANDS, CAL.      1917            PREFACE        As the author himself says in his _Dedicatoria_, a picture of Mexican  life is here offered, not as seen in large cities, which are much the  same all the world over, but in remote rural districts, \"en las  montañas.\" The tale is idyllic, but in spite of its romantic spirit it  presents a vivid picture of rural life in Mexico.    The text of this story is taken from the Fifth Edition, in the  Biblioteca de la Europa y América, Paris, 1891.    E.A.H.    M.J.L.            INTRODUCTION        The following is quoted from _Modern Mexican Authors_, by Frederick  Starr.[1]    \"No one who knows not the Mexican Indian village can appreciate the  heroism of the man, who, born of Indian parents, in such surroundings  attains to eminence in the nation. It is true that the Aztec mind is  keen, quick, receptive; true that the poorest Indian of that tribe  delights in things of beauty; true that the proverb and pithy saying in  their language show a philosophic perception. But after all this is  admitted, the horizon of the Indian village is narrow; there are few  motives to inspiration; life is hard and monotonous. It must indeed be a  divine spark that drives an Aztec village boy to rise above his  surroundings, to gain wide outlook, to achieve notable things.    \"Ignacio M. Altamirano, a pure Aztec Indian, was born at Tixtla, State  of Guerrero, December 12, 1834. The first fourteen years of his life  were the same as those of every Indian boy in Mexico; he learned the  Christian Doctrine and helped his parents in the field. Entering the  village school, he excelled, and was sent at public expense in 1849 to  Toluca to study at the Instituto Literario. From that time on his life  was mainly literary,--devoted to learning, to instructing, and to  writing. From Toluca he went to the city of Mexico, where he entered the  Colegio de San Juan Letran. In 1854 he participated in the Revolution.  From that date his political writings were important. Ever a Liberal of  the Liberals, he figured in the stirring events of the War of the  Reform, and in 1861 was in Congress. When aroused he was a speaker of  power; his address against the Law of Amnesty was terrific. Partner with  Juarez in the difficulties under Maximilian, he was also partner in the  glory of the re-established Republic. From then, as journalist, teacher,  encourager of public education, and man of letters, his life passed  usefully until 1889, when he was sent as Consul-General of the Republic  to Spain. His health failing there, he was transferred to the  corresponding appointment at Paris. He died February 13, 1893, at San  Remo. His illness was chiefly nostalgia, longing for that Mexico he  loved so much and served so well.    \"Altamirano was honored and loved by men of letters of both political  parties. His honesty, independence, strength, and marvelous gentleness  bound his friends firmly to him. He loved the young, and ever encouraged  those rising authors who form to-day the literary body of Mexico. He  ever urged the development of a national, a characteristic literature,  and pleaded for the utilization of national material.\"        [Footnote 1: Published by The Open Court Publishing Co.,  Chicago, 1904.]            DEDICATORIA A FRANCISCO SOSA      A Vd., mi querido amigo, a Vd. que hace justamente veinte años, en este  mes de Diciembre, casi me secuestró, por espacio de tres días, a fin de  que escribiera esta novela, se la dediqué, cuando se publicó por primera  vez en México.    Recuerdo bien que deseando Vd. que saliese algo mío en \"_El Álbum_\" de  Navidad que se imprimía, merced a los esfuerzos de Vd., en el folletín  de \"_La Iberia_\" periódico que dirigía nuestro inolvidable amigo Anselmo  de la Portilla, me invitó para que escribiera un cuadro de costumbres  mexicanas; prometí hacerlo, y fuerte con semejante promesa, se instaló  Vd. en mi estudio, y conociendo por tradición mi decantada pereza, no me  dejó descansar, alejó a las visitas que pudieran haberme interrumpido;  tomaba las hojas originales a medida que yo las escribía, para enviarlas  a la Imprenta, y no me dejó respirar hasta que la novela se concluyó.    Esto poco más o menos decía yo a Vd. en mi dedicatoria que no tengo a la  mano, y que Vd. mismo no ha podido conseguir, cuando se la he pedido  últimamente para reproducirla.    He tenido, pues, que escribirla de nuevo para la quinta edición que va a  hacerse en París y para la sexta que se publicará en francés.    Reciba Vd. con afecto este pequeño libro, puesto que a Vd. debo el  haberlo escrito.      IGNACIO M. ALTAMIRANO      PARÍS, Diciembre 26 de 1890            LA NAVIDAD EN LAS MONTAÑAS          I      El sol se ocultaba ya; las nieblas ascendían del profundo seno de los  valles; deteníanse[1] un momento entre los obscuros bosques y las  negras gargantas de la cordillera, como un rebaño gigantesco; después  avanzaban con rapidez hacia las cumbres; se desprendían majestuosas de  las agudas copas de los abetos e iban por último a envolver la soberbia  frente de las rocas, titánicos guardianes de la montaña que habían  desafiado allí, durante millares de siglos, las tempestades del cielo y  las agitaciones de la tierra.    Los últimos rayos del sol poniente franjaban de oro y de púrpura estos  enormes turbantes formados por la niebla, parecían incendiar las nubes  agrupadas en el horizonte, rielaban débiles en las aguas tranquilas del  remoto lago, temblaban al retirarse de las llanuras invadidas ya por la  sombra, y desaparecían después de iluminar con su última caricia la  obscura cresta de aquella oleada de pórfido.    Los postreros rumores del día anunciaban por dondequiera la proximidad  del silencio. A lo lejos, en los valles, en las faldas de las colinas, a  las orillas de los arroyos, veíanse reposando quietas y silenciosas las  vacadas; los ciervos cruzaban como sombras entre los árboles, en busca  de sus ocultas guaridas; las aves habían entonado ya sus himnos de la  tarde, y descansaban en sus lechos de ramas; en las rozas se encendía la  alegre hoguera de pino, y el viento glacial del invierno comenzaba a  agitarse entre las hojas.        [Footnote 1: The object pronoun may follow an indicative verb that is  the first word in a clause.]          II      La noche se acercaba tranquila y hermosa: era el 24 de diciembre, es  decir, que pronto la noche de Navidad cubriría nuestro hemisferio con su  sombra sagrada y animaría a los pueblos cristianos con sus alegrías  íntimas. ¿Quién que ha nacido cristiano y que ha oído renovar cada año,  en su infancia, la poética leyenda del nacimiento de Jesús, no siente en  semejante noche avivarse los más tiernos recuerdos de los primeros días  de la vida?    Yo ¡ay de mí! al pensar que me hallaba, en este día solemne, en medio  del silencio de aquellos bosques majestuosos, aun en presencia del  magnífico espectáculo que se presentaba a mi vista absorbiendo mis  sentidos, embargados poco ha por la admiración que causa la sublimidad  de la naturaleza, no pude menos que interrumpir mi dolorosa meditación,  y encerrándome en un religioso recogimiento, evoqué todas las dulces y  tiernas memorias de mis años juveniles. Ellas se despertaron alegres  como un enjambre de bulliciosas abejas y me transportaron a otros  tiempos, a otros lugares; ora al seno de mi familia humilde y piadosa,  ora al centro de populosas ciudades, donde el amor, la amistad y el  placer en delicioso concierto, habían hecho siempre grata para mi  corazón esa noche bendita.    Recordaba mi pueblo, mi pueblo querido, cuyos alegres habitantes  celebraban a porfía con bailes, cantos y modestos banquetes la  Nochebuena. Parecíame ver aquellas pobres casas adornadas con sus  Nacimientos y animadas por la alegría de la familia: recordaba la  pequeña iglesia iluminada, dejando ver desde el pórtico el precioso  Belén,[1] curiosamente levantado en el altar mayor: parecíame oir los  armoniosos repiques que resonaban en el campanario, medio derruido,  convocando a los fieles a la misa de gallo, y aun escuchaba con el  corazón palpitante la dulce voz de mi pobre y virtuoso padre,  excitándonos a mis hermanos y a mí a arreglarnos pronto para dirigirnos  a la iglesia, a fin de llegar a tiempo; y aun sentía la mano de mi buena  y santa madre tomar la mía para conducirme al oficio. Después me parecía  llegar, penetrar por entre el gentío que se precipitaba en la humilde  nave, avanzar hasta el pie del presbiterio, y allí arrodillarme  admirando la hermosura de las imágenes, el portal resplandeciente con la  escarcha, el semblante risueño de los _pastores_, el lujo deslumbrador  de los _Reyes magos_, y la iluminación espléndida del altar. Aspiraba  con delicia el fresco y sabroso aroma de las ramas de pino, y del heno  que se enredaba en ellas, que cubría el barandal del presbiterio y que  ocultaba el pie de los blandones. Veía después aparecer al sacerdote  revestido con su alba bordada, con su casulla de brocado, y seguido de  los acólitos, vestidos de rojo con sobrepellices blanquísimas. Y luego,  a la voz del celebrante, que se elevaba sonora entre los devotos  murmullos del concurso, cuando comenzaban a ascender las primeras  columnas de incienso, de aquel incienso recogido en los hermosos árboles  de mis bosques nativos, y que me traía con su perfume algo como el  perfume de la infancia, resonaban todavía en mis oídos los alegrísimos  sones populares con que los tañedores de arpas, de bandolinas y de  flautas, saludaban el nacimiento del Salvador.

Entom'd beneath the filmy web they lie    And wait the influence of a kinder sky;    When vernal sunbeams pierce the dark retreat,    The heaving tomb distends with vital heat;    The full formed brood, impatient of their cell,    Start from their trance, and burst their silken shell.    BARBAULD.          THE HISTORY OF INSECTS.           *       *       *       *       *    Insects are so called from a separation in the middle of their bodies,  seemingly cut into two parts, and joined together by a small ligature,  as we see in wasps and common flies.    However small and contemptible this class of beings may appear, at first  thought, yet, when we come to reflect, and carefully investigate, we  shall be struck with wonder and astonishment, and shall discover, that  the smallest gnat that buzzes in the meadow, is as much a subject of  admiration as the largest elephant that ranges the forest, or the  hugest whale which ploughs the deep; and when we consider the least  creature that we can imagine, myriads of which are too small to be  discovered without the help of glasses, and that each of their bodies is  made up of different organs or parts, by which they receive or retain  nourishment, &c. with the power of action, how natural the exclamation,  O \"Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all.\"  Under these considerations, that they are the work of the same great,  good, and Almighty hand that formed us, and that they are all capable of  feeling pleasure and pain, surely every little child, as well as older  person, ought carefully to avoid every kind of cruelty to any kind of  creature, great or small.    The supreme court of Judicature at Athens punished a boy for putting out  the eyes of a poor bird; and parents and masters should never overlook  an instance of cruelty to any thing that has life, however minute, and  seemingly contemptible the object may be.      \"I would not enter on my list of friends    (Though grac'd with polish'd manners, and fine sense,    Yet wanting sensibility) the man    Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.\"    COWPER.          ELEPHANT-BEETLE.    [Illustration]      The elephant-beetle is the largest of this kind hitherto known, and is  found in South America, particularly in Guiana, about the rivers Surinam  and Oroonoko. It is of a black colour, and the whole body is covered  with a shell, full as thick and as strong as that of a small crab. There  is one preserved in the museum that measures more than six inches.          GRASSHOPPER.    [Illustration]      Grasshoppers are too common to need description, as they abound almost  wherever there is green grass. One summer only is their period of life;  they are hatched in the spring, and die in the fall; previous to which,  they deposite their eggs in the earth, which the genial warmth of the  next season brings to life. They are food for many of the feathered  race.          CRICKET.      [Illustration]    There are two classes of crickets: viz. the field cricket, and the house  cricket; the latter inhabits warm places, the holes of the hearth, &c.  from whence we hear its notes, which are agreeable: it is said, that  they are purchased by some, and kept in a kind of cage, for the sake of  their music. Field crickets inhabit the meadows, and subsist on roots,  &c. as does another species, called the mole cricket.          LOCUST.    [Illustration]      There are different kinds of the locust; those we are acquainted with,  in this country, are represented in the above cut. In some seasons, they  are scarcely heard at all; in others, they are more numerous. About the  middle or latter part of summer, we hear them among the leaves of the  trees: their notes, which are continued about the space of one minute,  are loud at the beginning, and grow lower and lower, till they cease;  when they immediately fly to another tree, begin again, and end in the  same way, and so on.    In the eastern countries, a kind or kinds of locust, at different  periods, have been very numerous, and have done abundance of damage. In  the year 1650, a cloud of locusts entered Russia, in three different  places; and from thence spread over Poland and Lithuania; the air was  darkened, and the earth covered, in some places, to the depth of four  feet; the trees bent with heir weight, and the damage sustained exceeded  computation. Locusts were among the plagues of Egypt: sec Exodus, x. 15.          FLEA.    [Illustration]      This very troublesome little animal multiplies very fast among old rags,  dirt, straw, and litter, where hogs, cats, or dogs sleep; and in the  hair and bristles of those creatures: therefore, as a means of avoiding  such unwelcome neighbours, in the springs the cleanly farmer scrapes up  the rubbish about his woodpile, and around his house and barn, and  removes it into his field, where it also repays him by manuring his  lands. They abound in warm countries, particularly in the southern parts  of France and Italy.    When examined by a microscope, the flea is a pleasant object. The body  is curiously adorned with a suit of polished armour, neatly jointed, and  beset with a great number of sharp pins almost like the quills of a  porcupine: it has a small head, large eyes, two horns, or feelers, which  proceed from the head, and four long legs from the breast; they are very  hairy and long, and have several joints, which fold as it were one  within another.          LOUSE.    [Illustration]      These loathsome animals, however unwelcome, attend in troops, and add to  the afflictions of the unfortunate and lazy; but they are routed by the  hand of industry and cleanliness.    In examining the louse with a microscope, its external deformity strikes  us with disgust. It has six feet, two eyes, and a sort of sting,  proboscis, or sucker, with which it pierces the skin, and sucks the  blood. The skin of the louse is hard and transparent, with here and  there several bristly hairs: at the end of each leg are two claws, by  which it is enabled to lay hold of the hairs, on which it climbs. There  is scarcely any animal known to multiply so fast as this unwelcome  intruder: from an experiment of Lieuenhoek, a louse in eight weeks, may  see five thousand of its descendants.    Among the ancients, what is called the lousy disease was not uncommon:  Antiochus, Herod, and others are said to have died of this disorder.          ITCH ... MITE.    [Illustration]    CHEGO ... DEATHWATCH.      There are many species of mites, beside the itch animal and mite above:  to the naked eye, they appear like moving particles of dust: but the  microscope discovers them to be perfect animals, having as regular a  figure, and performing all the functions of life as perfectly as  creatures that exceed them many times in bulk: their eggs are so small  that a regular computation shews that 90 millions of them are not so  large as a common Pigeon's egg.    The Chego is a very small animal, about one fourth the size of a common  flea: it is very troublesome, in warm climates, to the poor blacks, such  as go barefoot, and the slovenly: it penetrates the skin, under which it  lays a bunch of eggs, which swell to the bigness of a small pea.    The Deathwatch, of which there are two kinds, is an insect famous for a  ticking noise, like a watch, which superstitious people take for a  presage of death, in the family where it is heard.          SCORPION.    [Illustration]      This is one of the largest of the insect tribe. It is met with in  different countries, and of various sizes, from two or three inches to  nearly a foot in length: it somewhat resembles a lobster, and casts its  skin, as the lobster does its shell.    Scorpions are common in hot countries: they are very bold and watchful:  when any thing approaches, they erect their tails, and stand ready to  inflict the direful sting. In some parts of Italy and France, they are  among the greatest pests that plague mankind: they are very numerous,  and are most common in old houses, in dry or decayed walls, and among  furniture, insomuch that it is attended with, much danger to remove the  same: their sting is generally a very deadly poison, though not in all  cases, owing to a difference of malignity of different animals, or some  other cause.    In the time of the children of Israel, scorpions were a plague in Egypt  and Canaan, as appears by the sacred writings. See Deuteronomy, viii.  15, and other passages.          ANTS.    [Illustration]        'Who can observe the faithful ant,    And not provide for future want.'    These little animals have been for ages considered as patterns of  industry: they were specially noticed by the wise king Solomon. He says,  \"go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise.\" The ant  lays eggs in the manner of common flies; from these eggs are "]]]
