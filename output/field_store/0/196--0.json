THE NEGROES OF CINCINNATI PRIOR TO THE CIVIL WAR        The study of the history of the Negroes of Cincinnati is unusually  important for the reason that from no other annals do we get such  striking evidence that the colored people generally thrive when  encouraged by their white neighbors. This story is otherwise significant  when we consider the fact that about a fourth of the persons of color  settling in the State of Ohio during the first half of the last century  made their homes in this city. Situated on a north bend of the Ohio  where commerce breaks bulk, Cincinnati rapidly developed, attracting  both foreigners and Americans, among whom were not a few Negroes.  Exactly how many persons of color were in this city during the first  decade of the nineteenth century is not yet known. It has been said that  there were no Negroes in Hamilton County in 1800.[1] It is evident, too,  that the real exodus of free Negroes and fugitives from the South to the  Northwest Territory did not begin prior to 1815, although their  attention had been earlier directed to this section as a more desirable  place for colonization than the shores of Africa.[2] As the reaction  following the era of good feeling toward the Negroes during the  revolutionary period had not reached its climax free persons of color  had been content to remain in the South.[3] The unexpected immigration  of these Negroes into this section and the last bold effort made to  drive them out marked epochs in their history in this city. The history  of these people prior to the Civil War, therefore, falls into three  periods, one of toleration from 1800 to 1826, one of persecution from  1826 to 1841, and one of amelioration from 1841 to 1861.    In the beginning the Negroes were not a live issue in Cincinnati. The  question of their settlement in that community was debated but resulted  in great diversity of opinion rather than a fixedness of judgment among  the citizens. The question came up in the Constitutional Convention of  1802 and provoked some discussion, but reaching no decision, the  convention simply left the Negroes out of the pale of the newly  organized body politic, discriminating against them together with  Indians and foreigners, by incorporating the word white into the  fundamental law.[4] The legislature to which the disposition of this  question was left, however, took it up in 1804 to calm the fears of  those who had more seriously considered the so-called menace of Negro  immigration. This body enacted a law, providing that no Negro or mulatto  should be allowed to remain permanently in that State, unless he could  furnish a certificate of freedom issued by some court in the United  States. Negroes then living there had to be registered before the  following June, giving the names of their children. No man could employ  a Negro who could not show such a certificate. Hiring a delinquent black  or harboring or hindering the capture of a runaway was punishable by a  fine of $50 and the owner of a fugitive thus illegally employed could  recover fifty cents a day for the services of his slave.[5]    As the fear of Negro immigration increased the law of 1804 was found to  be inadequate. In 1807, therefore, the legislature enacted another  measure providing that no Negro should be permitted to settle in Ohio  unless he could within twenty days give a bond to the amount of $500,  guaranteeing his good behavior and support. The fine for concealing a  fugitive was raised from $50 to $100, one half of which should go to the  informer. Negro evidence against the white man was prohibited.[6] This  law together with that of 1830 making the Negro ineligible for service  in the State militia, that of 1831 depriving persons of color of the  privilege of serving upon juries, and that of 1838 prohibiting the  education of colored children at the expense of the State, constituted  what were known as the \"Black Laws.\"[7]    Up to 1826, however, the Negroes of Cincinnati had not become a cause of  much trouble. Very little mention of them is made in the records of this  period. They were not wanted in this city but were tolerated as a  negligible factor. D. B. Warden, a traveler through the West in 1819,  observed that the blacks of Cincinnati were \"good-humoured, garrulous,  and profligate, generally disinclined to laborious occupations, and  prone to the performance of light and menial drudgery.\" Here the  traveler was taking effect for cause. \"Some few,\" said he, \"exercise the  humbler trades, and some appear to have formed a correct conception of  the objects and value of property, and are both industrious and  economical. A large proportion of them are reputed, and perhaps  correctly, to be habituated to petit larceny.\" But this had not become a  grave offence, for he said that not more than one individual had been  corporally punished by the courts since the settlement of the town.[8]    When, however, the South reached the conclusion that free Negroes were  an evil, and Quakers and philanthropists began to direct these  unfortunates to the Northwest Territory for colonization, a great  commotion arose in Southern Ohio and especially in Cincinnati.[9] How  rapid this movement was, may be best observed by noticing the statistics  of this period. There were 337 Negroes in Ohio in 1800; 1,890 in 1810;  4,723 in 1820; 9,586 in 1830; 17,342 in 1840; and 25,279 in 1850.[10]  Now Cincinnati had 410 Negroes in 1819;[11] 690 in 1826;[12] 2,255 in  1840;[13] and 3,237 in 1850.[14]    It was during the period between 1826 and 1840 that Cincinnati had to  grapple with the problem of the immigrating Negroes and the poor whites  from the uplands of Virginia and Kentucky. With some ill-informed  persons the question was whether that section should be settled by white  men or Negroes. The situation became more alarming when the Southern  philanthropic minority sometimes afforded a man like a master of  Pittsylvania County, Virginia, who settled 70 freedmen in Lawrence  County, Ohio, in one day.[15] It became unusually acute in Cincinnati  because of the close social and commercial relations between that city  and the slave States. Early in the nineteenth century Cincinnati became  a manufacturing center to which the South learned to look for supplies  of machinery, implements, furniture, and food.[16] The business men  prospering thereby were not advocates of slavery but rather than lose  trade by acquiring the reputation of harboring fugitive slaves or  frightening away whites by encouraging the immigration of Negroes, they  began to assume the attitude of driving the latter from those parts.    From this time until the forties the Negroes were a real issue in  Cincinnati. During the late twenties they not only had to suffer from  the legal disabilities provided in the \"Black Laws,\" but had to  withstand the humiliation of a rigid social ostracism.[17] They were  regarded as intruders and denounced as an idle, profligate and criminal  class with whom a self-respecting white man could not afford to  associate. Their children were not permitted to attend the public  schools and few persons braved the inconveniences of living under the  stigma of teaching a \"nigger school.\" Negroes were not welcome in the  white churches and when they secured admission thereto they had to go to  the \"black pew.\" Colored ministers were treated with very little  consideration by the white clergy as they feared that they might lose  caste and be compelled to give up their churches. The colored people  made little or no effort to go to white theaters or hotels and did not  attempt to ride in public conveyances on equal footing with members of  the other race. Not even white and colored children dared to play  together to the extent that such was permitted in the South.[18]    This situation became more serious when it extended to pursuits of  labor. White laborers there, as in other Northern cities during this  period, easily reached the position of thinking that it was a disgrace  to work with Negroes. This prejudice was so much more inconvenient to  the Negroes of Cincinnati than elsewhere because of the fact that most  of the menial labor in that city was done by Germans and Irishmen. Now,  since the Negroes could not follow ordinary menial occupations there was  nothing left them but the lowest form of \"drudgery,\" for which employers  often preferred colored women. It was, therefore, necessary in some  cases for the mother to earn the living for the family because the  father could get nothing to do. A colored man could not serve as an  ordinary drayman or porter without subjecting his employer to a heavy  penalty.[19]    The trades unions were then proscribing the employment of colored  mechanics.

We translate the following for the _International_ from a letter dated  London, June 15, to the _Cologne Gazette_.    \"Among the most remarkable writers of romances in England, three women  are entitled to be reckoned in the first rank, namely, Miss Jewsbury,  Miss Bronte, and Mrs. Gaskell. Miss Jewsbury issued her first work  about four years since, a novel, in three volumes, under the title of  'Zoe,' and since then she has published the 'Half Sisters.' Both these  works are excellent in manner as well as ideas, and show that their  author is a woman of profound thought and deep feeling. Both are  drawn from country life and the middle class, a sphere in which Miss  Jewsbury is at home. The tendency of the first is speculative, and  is based on religion; that of the second is social, relating to the  position of woman.    \"Miss Jewsbury is still young, for an authoress. She counts only some  thirty years, and many productions may be confidently expected from  her hand, though perhaps none will excel those already published,  for, after gaining a certain climax, no one excels himself. Her  usual residence is Manchester; it is but seldom that she visits the  metropolis; she is now here. She has lively and pleasing manners, a  slight person, fine features, a beautiful, dreamy, light brown eye.  She is attractive without being beautiful, retiring, altogether  without pretensions, and in conversation is neither brilliant nor very  intellectual,--a still, thoughtful, modest character.    \"Miss Bronte was long involved in a mysterious obscurity, from which  she first emerged into the light as an actually existing being, at her  present visit to London. Two years ago there appeared a romance, 'Jane  Eyre,' by 'Currer Bell,' which threw all England into astonishment.  Everybody was tormenting himself to discover the real author, for  there was no such person as Currer Bell, and no one could tell  whether the book was written by a man or woman, because the hues of  the romance now indicated a male and now female hand, without any  possibility of supposing that the whole originated with a single  pencil. The public attributed it now to one, now to another, and the  book passed to a second edition without the solution of the riddle.  At last there came out a second romance, 'Shirley,' by the same  author, which was devoured with equal avidity, although it could  not be compared to the former in value; and still the incognito was  preserved. Finally, late in the autumn of last year the report was  spread about that the image of Jane Eyre had been discovered in London  in the person of a pale young lady, with gray eyes, who had been  recognized as the long-sought authoress. Still she remained invisible.  And again, in June 1850, it is said that Currer Bell, Jane Eyre, Miss  Bronte,--for all three names mean the same person,--is in London,  though to all inquiries concerning the where and how a satisfactory  answer is still wanting. She is now indeed here, but not for the  curious public; she will not serve society as a lioness, will not be  gazed and gaped at. She is a simple child of the country, brought up  in the little parsonage of her father, in the North of England, and  must first accustom her eye to the gleaming diadem with which fame  seeks to deck her brow, before she can feel herself at home in her own  sunshine.    \"Our third lady, Mrs. Gaskell, belongs also to the country, and is  the wife of a Unitarian clergyman. In this capacity she has probably  had occasion to know a great deal of the poorer classes, to her honor  be it said. Her book, 'Mary Barton,' conducts us into the factory  workman's narrow dwelling, and depicts his joys and sorrows, his  aims and efforts, his wants and his misery, with a power of truth  that irresistibly lays hold upon the heart. The scene of the story  alternates from there to the city mansion of the factory owner,  where, along with luxury and splendor we find little love and little  happiness, and where sympathy with the condition of the workman is  wanting only because it is not known, and because no one understands  why or how the workman suffers. The book, is at once very beautiful,  very instructive, and written, in a spirit of conciliation.\"           *       *       *       *       *    MARGARET FULLER, MARCHESA D'OSSOLI.    Sarah Margaret Fuller, by marriage Marchioness of Ossoli, was born  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about the year 1807. Her father, Mr.  Timothy Fuller, was a lawyer, and from 1817 to 1825 he represented  the Middlesex district in Congress. At the close of his last term as  a legislator he purchased a farm near Cambridge, and determined to  abandon his profession for the more congenial one of agriculture; but  he died soon after, leaving a widow and six children, of whom Margaret  was the eldest.    At a very early age she exhibited unusual abilities, and was  particularly distinguished for an extraordinary facility in acquiring  languages. Her father, proud of the displays of her intelligence,  prematurely stimulated it to a degree that was ultimately injurious to  her physical constitution. At eight years of age he was accustomed to  require of her the composition of a number of Latin verses every day,  while her studies in philosophy, history, general science and current  literature were pressed to the limit of her capacities. When he first  went to Washington he was accustomed to speak of her as one \"better  skilled in Greek and Latin than half of the professors;\" and alluding  in one of her essays, to her attachment to foreign literature, she  herself observes that in childhood she had well-nigh forgotten her  English while constantly reading in other tongues.    Soon after the death of her father, she applied herself to teaching  as a vocation, first in Boston, then in Providence, and afterward  in Boston again, while her \"Conversations\" were for several seasons  attended by classes of women, some of them married, and many of them  of the most eminent positions in society. These conversations are  described by Dr. Orestes A. Brownson, as \"in the highest degree  brilliant, instructive, and inspiring,\" and our own recollections of  them confirm to us the justice of the applause with which they are  now referred to. She made her first appearance as an author, in a  translation of Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe, published in  Boston in 1839. When Mr. Emerson, in the following year, established  _The Dial_, she became one of the principal contributors to that  remarkable periodical, in which she wrote many of the most striking  papers on literature, art, and society. In the summer of 1843 she made  a journey to the Sault St. Marie, and in the next spring published  in Boston reminiscences of her tour, under the title of Summer on the  Lakes. _The Dial_ having been discontinued, she came to reside in New  York, where she had charge of the literary department of the New York  _Tribune_, which acquired a great accession of reputation from her  critical essays. Here in 1845 she published Woman in the Nineteenth  Century; and in 1846, Papers on Literature and Art, in two volumes,  consisting of essays and reviews, reprinted, with one exception, from  periodicals.    In the summer of 1845, she accompanied the family of a friend to  Europe, visiting England, Scotland, and France, and passing through  Italy to Rome, where they spent the ensuing winter. The next spring  she proceeded with her friends to the north of Italy, and there  stopped, spending most of the summer at Florence, and returning at  the approach of winter to Rome, where she was soon after married to  Giovanni, Marquis d'Ossoli, who made her acquaintance during her first  winter in that city. They resided in the Roman States until the last  summer, after the surrender of Rome to the French army, when they  deemed it expedient to go to Florence, both having taken an active  part in the Republican movement. They left Florence in June, and  at Leghorn embarked in the ship Elizabeth for New York. The passage  commenced auspiciously, but at Gibraltar the master of the ship died  of smallpox, and they were detained at the quarantine there some time  in consequence of this misfortune, but finally set sail again on the  8th of June, and arrived on our coast during the terrible storm of  the 18th and 19th ult., when, in the midst of darkness, rain, and a  terrific gale, the ship was hurled on the breakers of Fire Island,  near Long Island, and in a few hours was broken in pieces. Margaret  Fuller d'Ossoli, the Marquis d'Ossoli, and their son, two years of  age, with an Italian girl, and Mr. Horace Sumner of Boston, besides  several of the crew, lost their lives. We reprint a sketch of the  works and genius of Margaret Fuller, written several years ago by the  late Edgar A. Poe.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Miss Fuller was at one time editor, or one of the editors of the  'The Dial,' to which she contributed many of the most forcible and  certainly some of the most peculiar papers.

More lately she published  'Woman in the Nineteenth Century,' a work which has occasioned much  discussion, having had the good fortune to be warmly abused and  chivalrously defended.
