AND THE DUKES OF  BURGUNDY.    Sully, in his Memoirs, characterizes the reign of Charles VI. as \"that  reign so pregnant of sinister events, the grave of good laws and good  morals in France.\"  There is no exaggeration in these words; the  sixteenth century with its St. Bartholomew and The League, the eighteenth  with its reign of terror, and the nineteenth with its Commune of Paris,  contain scarcely any events so sinister as those of which France was, in  the reign of Charles VI., from 1380 to 1422, the theatre and the victim.    Scarcely was Charles V. laid on his bier when it was seen what a loss he  was and would be to his kingdom.  Discord arose in the king's own family.  In order to shorten the ever critical period of minority, Charles V. had  fixed the king's majority at the age of fourteen.  His son, Charles VI.,  was not yet twelve, and so had two years to remain under the guardianship  of his four uncles, the Dukes of Anjou, Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon; but  the last being only a maternal uncle and a less puissant prince than his  paternal uncles, it was between the other three that strife began for  temporary possession of the kingly power.    Though very unequal in talent and in force of character, they were all  three ambitious and jealous.  The eldest, the Duke of Anjou, who was  energetic, despotic, and stubborn, aspired to dominion in France for the  sake of making French influence subserve the conquest of the kingdom of  Naples, the object of his ambition.  The Duke of Berry was a mediocre,  restless, prodigal, and grasping prince.  The Duke of Burgundy, Philip  the Bold, the most able and the most powerful of the three, had been the  favorite, first of his father, King John, and then of his brother,  Charles V., who had confidence in him and readily adopted his counsels.  His marriage, in 1369, with the heiress to the countship of Flanders, had  been vigorously opposed by the Count of Flanders, the young princess's  father, and by the Flemish communes, ever more friendly to England than  to France; but the old Countess of Flanders, Marguerite of France, vexed  at the ill will of the count her son, had one day said to him, as she  tore open her dress before his eyes, \"Since you will not yield to your  mother's wishes, I will cut off these breasts which gave suck to you, to  you and to no other, and will throw them to the dogs to devour.\"  This  singular argument had moved the Count of Flanders; he had consented to  the marriage; and the Duke of Burgundy's power had received such  increment by it that on the 4th of October, 1380, when Charles VI.  was  crowned at Rheims, Philip the Bold, without a word said previously to  any, suddenly went up and sat himself down at the young king's side,  above his eldest brother, the Duke of Anjou, thus assuming, without  anybody's daring to oppose him, the rank and the rights of premier peer  of France.    He was not slow to demonstrate that his superiority in externals could  not fail to establish his political preponderance.  His father-in-law,  Count Louis of Flanders, was in almost continual strife with the great  Flemish communes, ever on the point of rising against the taxes he heaped  upon them and the blows he struck at their privileges.  The city of  Ghent, in particular, joined complaint with menace.  In 1381 the quarrel  became war.  The Ghentese at first experienced reverses.  \"Ah! if James  Van Artevelde were alive!\" said they.  James Van Artevelde had left a son  named Philip; and there was in Ghent a burgher-captain, Peter Dubois, who  went one evening to see Philip Van Artevelde.  \"What we want now,\" said  he, \"is to choose a captain of great renown.  Raise up again in this  country that father of yours who, in his lifetime, was so loved and  feared in Flanders.\"  \"Peter,\" replied Philip, \"you make me a great  offer; I promise that, if you put me in that place, I will do nought  without your advice.\"  \"Ah! well!\" said Dubois, \"can you really be  haughty and cruel?  The Flemings like to be treated so; with them you  must make no more account of the life of men than you do of larks when  the season for eating them comes.\"  \"I will do what shall be necessary,\"  said Van Artevelde.  The struggle grew violent between the count and the  communes of Flanders with Ghent at their head.  After alternations of  successes and reverses the Ghentese were victorious; and Count Louis with  difficulty escaped by hiding himself at Bruges in the house of a poor  woman who took him up into a loft where her children slept, and where he  lay flat between the paillasse and the feather-bed.  On leaving this  asylum he went to Bapaume to see his son-in-law, the Duke of Burgundy,  and to ask his aid.  \"My lord,\" said the duke to him, \"by the allegiance  I owe to you and also to the king you shall have satisfaction.  It were  to fail in one's duty to allow such a scum to govern a country.  Unless  order were restored, all knighthood and lordship might be destroyed in  Christendom.\"  The Duke of Burgundy went to Senlis, where Charles VI.  was, and asked for his support on behalf of the Count of Flanders.  The  question was referred to the king's council.  The Duke of Berry  hesitated, saying, \"The best part of the prelates and nobles must be  assembled and the whole matter set before them; we will see what is the  general opinion.\"  In the midst of this deliberation the young king came  in with a hawk on his wrist.  \"Well! my dear uncles,\" said he, \"of what  are you parleying?  Is it aught that I may know?\"  The Duke of Berry  enlightened him, saying, \"A brewer, named Van Artevelde, who is English  to the core, is besieging the remnant of the knights of Flanders shut up  in Oudenarde; and they can get no aid but from you.  What say you to it?  Are you minded to help the Count of Flanders to reconquer his heritage,  which those presumptuous villains have taken from him?\"    \"By my faith,\" answered the king, \"I am greatly minded; go we thither;  there is nothing I desire so much as to get on my harness, for I have  never yet borne arms; I would fain set out to-morrow.\"  Amongst the  prelates and lords summoned to Compiegne some spoke of the difficulties  and dangers that might be encountered.  \"Yes, yes,\" said the king, \"but  'begin nought and win nought.'\"  When the Flemings heard of the king's  decision they sent respectful letters to him, begging him to be their  mediator with the count their lord; but the letters were received with  scoffs, and the messengers were kept in prison.  At this news Van  Artevelde said, \"We must make alliance with the English; what meaneth  this King Wren of France?  It is the Duke of Burgundy leading him by the  nose, and he will not abide by his purpose; we will frighten France by  showing her that we have the English for allies.\"  But Van Artevelde was  under a delusion; Edward III. was no longer King of England; the  Flemings' demand was considered there to be arrogant and opposed to the  interests of the lords in all countries; and the alliance was not  concluded.

CHAPTER XXVIII.----FRANCIS I. AND CHARLES V.    The closer the study and the wider the contemplation a Frenchman bestows  upon his country's history, the deeper will be his feelings of patriotic  pride, dashed with a tinge of sadness.  France, in respect of her  national unity, is the most ancient amongst the states of Christian  Europe.  During her long existence she has passed through very different  regimens, the chaos of barbarism, the feudal system, absolute monarchy,  constitutional monarchy, and republicanism.  Under all these regimens she  has had no lack of greatness and glory, material power and intellectual  lustre, moral virtues and the charms of social life.  Her barbarism had  its Charlemagne; her feudal system St. Louis, Joan of Arc, and Bayard;  her absolute monarchy Henry IV. and Louis XIV.  Of our own times we say  nothing.  France has shone in war and in peace, through the sword and  through the intellect: she has by turns conquered and beguiled,  enlightened and troubled Europe; she has always offered to the foreigner  a spectacle or an abode full of the curious and the attractive, of noble  pleasures and of mundane amusements.  And still, after so many centuries  of such a grand and brilliant career, France has not yet attained the end  to which she ever aspired, to which all civilized communities aspire, and  that is, order in the midst of movement, security and liberty united and  lasting.  She has had shortcomings which have prevented her from reaping  the full advantage of her merits; she has committed faults which have  involved her in reverses.  Two things, essential to political prosperity  amongst communities of men, have hitherto been to seek in her;  predominance of public spirit over the spirit of caste or of profession,  and moderation and fixity in respect of national ambition both at home  and abroad.  France has been a victim to the personal passions of her  chiefs and to her own reckless changeability.    We are entering upon the history of a period and a reign during which  this intermixture of merits and demerits, of virtues and vices, of  progress and backsliding, was powerfully and attractively exhibited  amongst the French.  Francis I., his government and his times commence  the era of modern France, and bring clearly to view the causes of her  greatnesses and her weaknesses.    Francis I. had received from God all the gifts that can adorn a man: he  was handsome and tall and strong; his armor, preserved in the Louvre, is  that of a man six feet high; his eyes were brilliant and soft, his smile  was gracious, his manners were winning.  From his very childhood he  showed that he had wits, enterprise, skill, and boldness.  He was but  seven years old when, \"on the day of the conversion of St. Paul, January  25, 1501, about two P. M., my king, my lord, my Caesar, and my son, was  run away with, near Amboise, by a hackney which had been given him by  Marshal de Gye; and so great was the danger that those who were present  thought it was all over; howbeit God, the protector of widowed women and  the defender of orphans, foreseeing things to come, was pleased not to  forsake me, knowing that, if accident had so suddenly deprived me of my  love, I should have been too utter a wretch.\"  Such is the account given  of this little incident by his mother, Louise of Savoy, who was at that  time habitually kept, by Anne of Brittany's jealousy, at a distance from  Paris and the court.  [_Journal de Louise de Savoie_ in the Petitot  collection of _Memoires sur l'Histoire de France,_ Series I.  t. xvi.  p. 390.]  Some years later the young prince, who had become an ardent  huntsman, took the fancy into his head one day to let loose in the  courtyard of the castle of Amboise a wild boar which he had just caught  in the forest.  The animal came to a door, burst it open with a blow of  his snout, and walked up into the apartments.  Those who were there took  to their heels; but Francis went after the boar, came up with him, killed  him with a swordthrust, and sent him rolling down the staircase into the  courtyard.  When, in 1513, Louis XII. sent for the young Duke of  Angouleme and bade him go and defend Picardy against the English, Francis  had scarcely done anything beyond so employing his natural gifts as to  delight the little court of which he was the centre; an estimable trait,  but very insufficient for the government of a people.    When, two years afterwards, on the 1st of January, 1515, he ascended the  throne before he had attained his one and twentieth year, it was a  brilliant and brave but spoiled child that became king.  He had been  under the governance of Artus Gouffier, Sire de Boisy, a nobleman of  Poitou, who had exerted himself to make his royal pupil a loyal knight,  well trained in the moral code and all the graces of knighthood, but  without drawing his attention to more serious studies or preparing him  for the task of government.  The young Francis d'Angouleme lived and was  moulded under the influence of two women, his mother, Louise of Savoy,  and his eldest sister, Marguerite, who both of them loved and adored him  with passionate idolatry.  It has just been shown in what terms Louise of  Savoy, in her daily collection of private memoranda, used to speak to  herself of her son, \"My king, my lord, my Caesar, and my son!\"  She was  proud, ambitious, audacious, or pliant at need, able and steadfast in  mind, violent and dissolute in her habits, greedy of pleasure and of  money as well as of power, so that she gave her son neither moral  principles nor a moral example: for him the supreme kingship, for herself  the rank, influence, and wealth of a queen-mother, and, for both,  greatness that might subserve the gratification of their passions--this  was all her dream and all her aim as a mother.  Of quite another sort  were the character and sentiments of Marguerite de Valois.  She was born  on the 11th of April, 1492, and was, therefore, only two years older than  her brother Francis; but her more delicate nature was sooner and more  richly cultivated and developed.  She was brought up with strictness by  a most excellent and most venerable dame, in whom all the virtues, at  rivalry one with another, existed together.  [Madame de Chatillon, whose  deceased husband had been governor to King Charles VIII.]  As she was  discovered to have rare intellectual gifts and a very keen relish for  learning, she was provided with every kind of preceptors, who made her  proficient in profane letters, as they were then called.  Marguerite  learned Latin, Greek, philosophy, and especially theology.  \"At fifteen  years of age,\" says a contemporary, \"the spirit of God began to manifest  itself in her eyes, in her face, in her walk, in her speech, and.  generally in all her actions.\"  \"She had a heart,\" says Brantome,  \"mighty devoted to God, and she loved mightily to compose spiritual  songs.  .  .  .  She also devoted herself to letters in her young days,  and continued them as long as she lived, loving and conversing with, in  the time of her greatness, the most learned folks of her brother's  kingdom, who honored her so that they called her their Maecenas.\"  Learning, however, was far from absorbing the whole of this young soul.  \"She,\" says a"]]]
