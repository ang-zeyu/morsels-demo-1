No good  can come of such methods, for there are no short cuts to excellence. But  help of a very practical kind it is the aim of the following pages to  give; although it may be necessary to make a greater call upon the  intelligence of the student than these Victorian methods attempted.    It was not until some time after having passed through the course of  training in two of our chief schools of art that the author got any idea  of what drawing really meant. What was taught was the faithful copying  of a series of objects, beginning with the simplest forms, such as  cubes, cones, cylinders, &c. (an excellent system to begin with at  present in danger of some neglect), after which more complicated objects  in plaster of Paris were attempted, and finally copies of the human head  and figure posed in suspended animation and supported by blocks, &c. In  so far as this was accurately done, all this mechanical training of eye  and hand was excellent; but it was not enough. And when with an eye  trained to the closest mechanical accuracy the author visited the  galleries of the Continent and studied the drawings of the old masters,  it soon became apparent that either his or their ideas of drawing were  all wrong. Very few drawings could be found sufficiently \"like the  model\" to obtain the prize at either of the great schools he had  attended. Luckily there was just enough modesty left for him to realise  that possibly they were in some mysterious way right and his own  training in some way lacking. And so he set to work to try and climb the  long uphill road that separates mechanically accurate drawing from  artistically accurate drawing.    Now this journey should have been commenced much earlier, and perhaps it  was due to his own stupidity that it was not; but it was with a vague  idea of saving some students from such wrong-headedness, and possibly  straightening out some of the path, that he accepted the invitation to  write this book.    In writing upon any matter of experience, such as art, the possibilities  of misunderstanding are enormous, and one shudders to think of the  things that may be put down to one's credit, owing to such  misunderstandings. It is like writing about the taste of sugar, you are  only likely to be understood by those who have already experienced the  flavour; by those who have not, the wildest interpretation will be put  upon your words. The written word is necessarily confined to the things  of the understanding because only the understanding has written  language; whereas art deals with ideas of a different mental texture,  which words can only vaguely suggest. However, there are a large number  of people who, although they cannot be said to have experienced in a  full sense any works of art, have undoubtedly the impelling desire which  a little direction may lead on to a fuller appreciation. And it is to  such that books on art are useful. So that although this book is  primarily addressed to working students, it is hoped that it may be of  interest to that increasing number of people who, tired with the rush  and struggle of modern existence, seek refreshment in artistic things.  To many such in this country modern art is still a closed book; its  point of view is so different from that of the art they have been  brought up with, that they refuse to have anything to do with it.  Whereas, if they only took the trouble to find out something of the  point of view of the modern artist, they would discover new beauties  they little suspected.    If anybody looks at a picture by Claude Monet from the point of view of  a Raphael, he will see nothing but a meaningless jargon of wild  paint-strokes. And if anybody looks at a Raphael from the point of view  of a Claude Monet, he will, no doubt, only see hard, tinny figures in a  setting devoid of any of the lovely atmosphere that always envelops form  seen in nature. So wide apart are some of the points of view in  painting. In the treatment of form these differences in point of view  make for enormous variety in the work. So that no apology need be made  for the large amount of space occupied in the following pages by what is  usually dismissed as mere theory; but what is in reality the first  essential of any good practice in drawing. To have a clear idea of what  it is you wish to do, is the first necessity of any successful  performance. But our exhibitions are full of works that show how seldom  this is the case in art. Works showing much ingenuity and ability, but  no artistic brains; pictures that are little more than school studies,  exercises in the representation of carefully or carelessly arranged  objects, but cold to any artistic intention.    At this time particularly some principles, and a clear intellectual  understanding of what it is you are trying to do, are needed. We have no  set traditions to guide us. The times when the student accepted the  style and traditions of his master and blindly followed them until he  found himself, are gone. Such conditions belonged to an age when  intercommunication was difficult, and when the artistic horizon was  restricted to a single town or province. Science has altered all that,  and we may regret the loss of local colour and singleness of aim this  growth of art in separate compartments produced; but it is unlikely that  such conditions will occur again. Quick means of transit and cheap  methods of reproduction have brought the art of the whole world to our  doors. Where formerly the artistic food at the disposal of the student  was restricted to the few pictures in his vicinity and some prints of  others, now there is scarcely a picture of note in the world that is not  known to the average student, either from personal inspection at our  museums and loan exhibitions, or from excellent photographic  reproductions. Not only European art, but the art of the East, China and  Japan, is part of the formative influence by which he is surrounded; not  to mention the modern science of light and colour that has had such an  influence on technique. It is no wonder that a period of artistic  indigestion is upon us. Hence the student has need of sound principles  and a clear understanding of the science of his art, if he would select  from this mass of material those things which answer to his own inner  need for artistic expression.    The position of art to-day is like that of a river where many  tributaries meeting at one point, suddenly turn the steady flow to  turbulence, the many streams jostling each other and the different  currents pulling hither and thither. After a time these newly-met forces  will adjust themselves to the altered condition, and a larger, finer  stream be the result. Something analogous to this would seem to be  happening in art at the present time, when all nations and all schools  are acting and reacting upon each other, and art is losing its national  characteristics. The hope of the future is that a larger and deeper art,  answering to the altered conditions of humanity, will result.    There are those who would leave this scene of struggling influences and  away up on some bare primitive mountain-top start a new stream, begin  all over again. But however necessary it may be to give the primitive  mountain waters that were the start of all the streams a more prominent  place in the new flow onwards, it is unlikely that much can come of any  attempt to leave the turbulent waters, go backwards, and start again;  they can only flow onwards. To speak more plainly, the complexity of  modern art influences may make it necessary to call attention to the  primitive principles of expression that should never be lost sight of in  any work, but hardly justifies the attitude of those anarchists in art  who would flout the heritage of culture we possess and attempt a new  start. Such attempts however when sincere are interesting and may be  productive of some new vitality, adding to the weight of the main  stream. But it must be along the main stream, along lines in harmony  with tradition that the chief advance must be looked for.    Although it has been felt necessary to devote much space to an attempt  to find principles that may be said to be at the basis of the art of all  nations, the executive side of the question has not been neglected. And  it is hoped that the logical method for the study of drawing from the  two opposite points of view of line and mass here advocated may be  useful, and help students to avoid some of the confusion that results  from attempting simultaneously the study of these different qualities of  form expression.           *       *       *       *       *          CONTENTS      I.

The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of Crescent  Bay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered hills at the  back were smothered. You could not see where they ended and the paddocks  and bungalows began. The sandy road was gone and the paddocks and  bungalows the other side of it; there were no white dunes covered with  reddish grass beyond them; there was nothing to mark which was beach and  where was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was blue. Big drops  hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery, fluffy toi-toi  was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and the pinks in the  bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness. Drenched were the  cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat nasturtium leaves. It  looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in the darkness, as though  one immense wave had come rippling, rippling--how far? Perhaps if you  had waked up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish  flicking in at the window and gone again....    Ah-Aah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came the sound  of little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping between the smooth  stones, gushing into ferny basins and out again; and there was the  splashing of big drops on large leaves, and something else--what was  it?--a faint stirring and shaking, the snapping of a twig and then such  silence that it seemed some one was listening.    Round the corner of Crescent Bay, between the piled-up masses of broken  rock, a flock of sheep came pattering. They were huddled together, a  small, tossing, woolly mass, and their thin, stick-like legs trotted  along quickly as if the cold and the quiet had frightened them. Behind  them an old sheep-dog, his soaking paws covered with sand, ran along  with his nose to the ground, but carelessly, as if thinking of something  else. And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself appeared. He  was a lean, upright old man, in a frieze coat that was covered with a  web of tiny drops, velvet trousers tied under the knee, and a wide-awake  with a folded blue handkerchief round the brim. One hand was crammed  into his belt, the other grasped a beautifully smooth yellow stick. And  as he walked, taking his time, he kept up a very soft light whistling,  an airy, far-away fluting that sounded mournful and tender. The old  dog cut an ancient caper or two and then drew up sharp, ashamed of his  levity, and walked a few dignified paces by his master's side. The sheep  ran forward in little pattering rushes; they began to bleat, and ghostly  flocks and herds answered them from under the sea. \"Baa! Baaa!\" For a  time they seemed to be always on the same piece of ground. There ahead  was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles; the same soaking  bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings. Then  something immense came into view; an enormous shock-haired giant with  his arms stretched out. It was the big gum-tree outside Mrs. Stubbs'  shop, and as they passed by there was a strong whiff of eucalyptus.  And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist. The shepherd stopped  whistling; he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on his wet sleeve and,  screwing up his eyes, glanced in the direction of the sea. The sun  was rising. It was marvellous how quickly the mist thinned, sped away,  dissolved from the shallow plain, rolled up from the bush and was gone  as if in a hurry to escape; big twists and curls jostled and shouldered  each other as the silvery beams broadened. The far-away sky--a bright,  pure blue--was reflected in the puddles, and the drops, swimming along  the telegraph poles, flashed into points of light. Now the leaping,  glittering sea was so bright it made one's eyes ache to look at it. The  shepherd drew a pipe, the bowl as small as an acorn, out of his breast  pocket, fumbled for a chunk of speckled tobacco, pared off a few  shavings and stuffed the bowl. He was a grave, fine-looking old man.  As he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his head, the dog, watching,  looked proud of him.    \"Baa! Baaa!\" The sheep spread out into a fan. They were just clear of  the summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a  drowsy head; their cry sounded in the dreams of little children... who  lifted their arms to drag down, to cuddle the darling little woolly  lambs of sleep. Then the first inhabitant appeared; it was the Burnells'  cat Florrie, sitting on the gatepost, far too early as usual, looking  for their milk-girl. When she saw the old sheep-dog she sprang up  quickly, arched her back, drew in her tabby head, and seemed to give a  little fastidious shiver. \"Ugh! What a coarse, revolting creature!\" said  Florrie. But the old sheep-dog, not looking up, waggled past, flinging  out his legs from side to side. Only one of his ears twitched to prove  that he saw, and thought her a silly young female.    The breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and wet  black earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea. Myriads of birds  were singing. A goldfinch flew over the shepherd's head and, perching on  the tiptop of a spray, it turned to the sun, ruffling its small breast  feathers. And now they had passed the fisherman's hut, passed the  charred-looking little whare where Leila the milk-girl lived with her  old Gran. The sheep strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag, the sheep-dog,  padded after, rounded them up and headed them for the steeper, narrower  rocky pass that led out of Crescent Bay and towards Daylight Cove. \"Baa!  Baa!\" Faint the cry came as they rocked along the fast-drying road. The  shepherd put away his pipe, dropping it into his breast-pocket so that  the little bowl hung over. And straightway the soft airy whistling began  again. Wag ran out along a ledge of rock after something that smelled,  and ran back again disgusted. Then pushing, nudging, hurrying, the sheep  rounded the bend and the shepherd followed after out of sight.      Chapter 1.II.    A few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened, and a  figure in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down the paddock, cleared  the stile, rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow, staggered  up the sandy hillock, and raced for dear life over the big porous  stones, over the cold, wet pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed  like oil. Splish-Splosh! Splish-Splosh! The water bubbled round his  legs as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting. First man in as usual! He'd  beaten them all again. And he swooped down to souse his head and neck.    \"Hail, brother! All hail, Thou Mighty One!\" A velvety bass voice came  booming over the water.    Great Scott! Damnation take it! Stanley lifted up to see a dark head  bobbing far out and an arm lifted. It was Jonathan Trout--there before  him! \"Glorious morning!\" sang the voice.    \"Yes, very fine!\" said Stanley briefly. Why the dickens didn't the  fellow stick to his part of the sea? Why should he come barging over to  this exact spot? Stanley gave a kick, a lunge and struck out, swimming  overarm. But Jonathan was a match for him. Up he came, his black hair  sleek on his forehead, his short beard sleek.    \"I had an extraordinary dream last night!\" he shouted.    What was the matter with the man? This mania for conversation irritated  Stanley beyond words. And it was always the same--always some piffle  about a dream he'd had, or some cranky idea he'd got hold of, or some  rot he'd been reading. Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with  his legs till he was a living waterspout. But even then... \"I dreamed I  was hanging over a terrifically high cliff, shouting to some one below.\"  You would be! thought Stanley. He could stick no more of it. He stopped  splashing. \"Look here, Trout,\" he said, \"I'm in rather a hurry this  morning.\"    \"You're WHAT?\" Jonathan was so surprised--or pretended to be--that he  sank under the water, then reappeared again blowing.    \"All I mean is,\" said Stanley, \"I've no time to--to--to fool about.  I want to get this over. I'm in a hurry. I've work to do this  morning--see?\"    Jonathan was gone before Stanley had finished. \"Pass, friend!\" said the  bass voice gently, and he slid away through the water with scarcely  a ripple... But curse the fellow! He'd ruined Stanley's bathe. What an  unpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again, and  then as quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the beach. He felt  cheated.    Jonathan stayed a little longer in the water. He floated, gently moving  his hands like fins, and letting the sea rock his long, skinny body. It  was curious, but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell.  True, he had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes, to poke fun at  him, but at bottom he was sorry for the fellow. There was something  pathetic in his determination to make a job of everything. You couldn't  help feeling he'd be caught out one day, and then what an almighty  cropper he'd come! At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode  past him, and broke along the beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty!  And now there came another. That was the way to live--carelessly,  recklessly, spending oneself. He got on to his feet and began to wade  towards the shore, pressing his toes into the firm, wrinkled sand. To  take things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of life, but to  give way to it--that was what was needed. It was this tension that was  all wrong. To"]]]
