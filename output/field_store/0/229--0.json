There has been so little written upon this  subject, not withstanding the countless references to the Teachings in  the many works upon occultism, that the many earnest searchers after the  Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the appearance of this present  volume.    The purpose of this work is not the enunciation of any special  philosophy or doctrine, but rather is to give to the students a  statement of the Truth that will serve to reconcile the many bits of  occult knowledge that they may have acquired, but which are apparently  opposed to each other and which often serve to discourage and disgust  the beginner in the study. Our intent is not to erect a new Temple of  Knowledge, but rather to place in the hands of the student a Master-Key  with which he may open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery  through the main portals he has already entered.    There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the world which  have been so closely guarded as the fragments of the Hermetic Teachings  which have come down to us over the tens of centuries which have elapsed  since the lifetime of its great founder, Hermes Trismegistus, the  \"scribe of the gods,\" who dwelt in old Egypt in the days when the  present race of men was in its infancy. Contemporary with Abraham, and,  if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage, Hermes  was, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism, whose rays have served  to illumine the countless teachings which have been promulgated since  his time. All the fundamental and basic teachings embedded in the  esoteric teachings of every race may be traced back to Hermes. Even the  most ancient teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the  original Hermetic Teachings.    From the land of the Ganges many advanced occultists wandered to the  land of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master. From him they obtained  the Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views, and  thus the Secret Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also  came the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master of  Masters, and his influence was so great that in spite of the many  wanderings from the path on the part of the centuries of teachers in  these different lands, there may still be found a certain basic  resemblance and correspondence which underlies the many and often quite  divergent theories entertained and taught by the occultists of these  different lands today. The student of Comparative Religions will be able  to perceive the influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion  worthy of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion or  one in full vigor in our own times. There is always certain  correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the Hermetic  Teachings act as the Great Reconciler.    The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of planting  the great Seed-Truth which has grown and blossomed in so many strange  forms, rather than to establish a school of philosophy which would  dominate, the world's thought. But, nevertheless, the original truths  taught by him have been kept intact in their original purity by a few  men each age, who, refusing great numbers of half-developed students and  followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their truth for the  few who were ready to comprehend and master it. From lip to ear the  truth has been handed down among the few. There have always been a few  Initiates in each generation, in the various lands of the earth, who  kept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have  always been willing to use their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of  the outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded by  reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign  matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the  Truth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom. These  men devoted their lives to the labor of love which the poet has so well  stated in his lines:         \"O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age       in its dark cavern--in its holy temples cherished. Fed       by pure ministers of love--let not the flame die out!\"    These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers.  They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in  each generation who are ready for the truth, or who would recognize it  if it were presented to them. They reserve the \"strong meat for men,\"  while others furnish the \"milk for babes.\" They reserve their pearls of  wisdom for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in  their crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar  swine, who would trample them in the mud and mix them with their  disgusting mental food. But still these men have never forgotten or  overlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of  the words of truth to those ready to receive it, which teaching is  stated in The Kybalion as follows: \"Where fall the footsteps of the  Master, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide.\" And again:  \"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to  fill them with wisdom.\" But their customary attitude has always been  strictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The  Kybalion: \"The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of  Understanding.\"    There are those who have criticized this attitude of the Hermetists, and  who have claimed that they did not manifest the proper spirit in their  policy of seclusion and reticence. But a moment's glance back over the  pages of history will show the wisdom of the Masters, who knew the folly  of attempting to teach to the world that which it was neither ready or  willing to receive. The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs, and  have, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their closed  lips, while the \"heathen raged noisily about them\" in their customary  amusement of putting to death and torture the honest but misguided  enthusiasts who imagined that they could force upon a race of barbarians  the truth capable of being understood only by the elect who had advanced  along The Path.    And the spirit of persecution has not as yet died out in the land. There  are certain Hermetic Teachings, which, if publicly promulgated, would  bring down upon the teachers a great cry of scorn and revilement from  the multitude, who would again raise the cry of \"Crucify! Crucify.\"    In this little work we have endeavored to give you an idea of the  fundamental teachings of The Kybalion, striving to give you the working  Principles, leaving you to apply therm yourselves, rather than  attempting to work out the teaching in detail. If you are a true  student, you will be able to work out and apply these Principles--if  not, then you must develop yourself into one, for otherwise the Hermetic  Teachings will be as \"words, words, words\" to you.    THE THREE INITIATES.        CHAPTER I    THE HERMETIC PHILOSOPHY        \"The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears      of Understanding\"--The Kybalion.    From old Egypt have come the fundamental esoteric and occult teachings  which have so strongly influenced the philosophies of all races, nations  and peoples, for several thousand years. Egypt, the home of the Pyramids  and the Sphinx, was the birthplace of the Hidden Wisdom and Mystic  Teachings. From her Secret Doctrine all nations have borrowed. India,  Persia, Chaldea, Medea, China, Japan, Assyria, ancient Greece and Rome,  and other ancient countries partook liberally at the feast of knowledge  which the Hierophants and Masters of the Land of Isis so freely provided  for those who came prepared to partake of the great store of Mystic and  Occult Lore which the masterminds of that ancient land had gathered  together.    In ancient Egypt dwelt the great Adepts and Masters who have never been  surpassed, and who seldom have been equaled, during the centuries that  have taken their processional flight since the days of the Great Hermes.  In Egypt was located the Great Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. At the  doors of her Temples entered the Neophytes who afterward, as  Hierophants, Adepts, and Masters, traveled to the four corners of the  earth, carrying with them the precious knowledge which they were ready,  anxious, and willing to pass on to those who were ready to receive the  same.

The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry is very  interesting in itself. It is also a pregnant example of the contrast  between the scientific and the emotional methods of regarding nature;  and it admirably illustrates the differences between well-grounded,  suggestive, hypotheses, and baseless speculations.    I have tried to tell the story so that it may be intelligible to the  ordinary reader.                                                  M.M. PATTISON MUIR.

For thousands of years before men had any accurate and exact knowledge  of the changes of material things, they had thought about these  changes, regarded them as revelations of spiritual truths, built on  them theories of things in heaven and earth (and a good many things in  neither), and used them in manufactures, arts, and handicrafts,  especially in one very curious manufacture wherein not the thousandth  fragment of a grain of the finished article was ever produced.    The accurate and systematic study of the changes which material things  undergo is called chemistry; we may, perhaps, describe alchemy as the  superficial, and what may be called subjective, examination of these  changes, and the speculative systems, and imaginary arts and  manufactures, founded on that examination.    We are assured by many old writers that Adam was the first alchemist,  and we are told by one of the initiated that Adam was created on the  sixth day, being the 15th of March, of the first year of the world;  certainly alchemy had a long life, for chemistry did not begin until  about the middle of the 18th century.    No branch of science has had so long a period of incubation as  chemistry. There must be some extraordinary difficulty in the way of  disentangling the steps of those changes wherein substances of one  kind are produced from substances totally unlike them. To inquire how  those of acute intellects and much learning regarded such occurrences  in the times when man's outlook on the world was very different from  what it is now, ought to be interesting, and the results of that  inquiry must surely be instructive.    If the reader turns to a modern book on chemistry (for instance, _The  Story of the Chemical Elements_, in this series), he will find, at  first, superficial descriptions of special instances of those  occurrences which are the subject of the chemist's study; he will  learn that only certain parts of such events are dealt with in  chemistry; more accurate descriptions will then be given of changes  which occur in nature, or can be produced by altering the ordinary  conditions, and the reader will be taught to see certain points of  likeness between these changes; he will be shown how to disentangle  chemical occurrences, to find their similarities and differences; and,  gradually, he will feel his way to general statements, which are more  or less rigorous and accurate expressions of what holds good in a  large number of chemical processes; finally, he will discover that  some generalisations have been made which are exact and completely  accurate descriptions applicable to every case of chemical change.    But if we turn to the writings of the alchemists, we are in a  different world. There is nothing even remotely resembling what one  finds in a modern book on chemistry.    Here are a few quotations from alchemical writings [1]:       [1] Most of the quotations from alchemical writings, in this     book, are taken from a series of translations, published in     1893-94, under the supervision of Mr A.E. Waite.        \"It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to    draw out its soul.... Copper is like a man; it has a soul and a    body ... the soul is the most subtile part ... that is to say, the    tinctorial spirit. The body is the ponderable, material,    terrestrial thing, endowed with a shadow.... After a series of    suitable treatments copper becomes without shadow and better than    gold.... The elements grow and are transmuted, because it is their    qualities, not their substances which are contrary.\" (Stephanus of    Alexandria, about 620 A.D.)      \"If we would elicit our Medecine from the precious metals, we must    destroy the particular metalic form, without impairing its    specific properties. The specific properties of the metal have    their abode in its spiritual part, which resides in homogeneous    water. Thus we must destroy the particular form of gold, and    change it into its generic homogeneous water, in which the spirit    of gold is preserved; this spirit afterwards restores the    consistency of its water, and brings forth a new form (after the    necessary putrefaction) a thousand times more perfect than the    form of gold which it lost by being reincrudated.\" (Philalethes,    17th century.)      \"The bodily nature of things is a concealing outward vesture.\"    (Michael Sendivogius, 17th century.)      \"Nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance, but    in the virtue ... the less there is of body, the more in    proportion is the virtue.\" (Paracelsus, 16th century.)      \"There are four elements, and each has at its centre another    element which makes it what it is.
