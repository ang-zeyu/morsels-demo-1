Miss Betty.\" The Chinese cook  flourished his rolling pin with one hand and swung his apron viciously  with the other as he held open the screen door and swept out some  imaginary flies.    Lee Chang, cook for the bunk house in the oil fields, could do several  things at one time, as he had frequently proved.    The girl, who was watching a wiry little bay horse contentedly crop grass  that grew in straggling whisps about the fence posts, looked up and  showed an even row of white teeth as she smiled.    \"I don't think we're going to stay for dinner to-day,\" she said half  regretfully. \"I know your apple tarts, Lee Chang--they are delicious.\"    The fat Chinaman closed the screen door and went on with his pastry  making. From time to time, as he passed from the table to the oven, he  glanced out. Betty Gordon still stood watching the horse.    \"That Bob no come?\" inquired Lee Chang, poking his head out of the door  again. Fast developing into a good American, his natural trait of  curiosity gave him the advantage of acquiring information blandly and  with ease.    Betty shaded her eyes with her hand. The Oklahoma sun was pitiless. Far  up the road that ran straight away from the bunk house a faint cloud of  dust was rising.    \"He's coming now,\" said the girl confidently.    Lee Chang grunted and returned to his work, satisfied that whatever Betty  was waiting for would soon be at hand.    \"Bake tart 'fore that boy goes away,\" the Chinaman muttered to himself,  waddling hastily to the oven, opening it, and closing the door again with  a satisfied sniff.    The cloud of dust whirled more madly, rose higher. Out from the center of  it finally emerged a raw-boned white horse that galloped with amazing  awkwardness and incredible speed. Astride him sat a slim, tanned youth  with eyes as blue as Betty Gordon's were dark.    \"Got something for you!\" he called, waving his arm in the motion of  lasso-throwing. \"Catch if you can!\"    \"Oh, don't!\" cried Betty eagerly. \"What is it, Bob? Be careful or you'll  break it.\"    Bob Henderson reined in his mount and slipped to the ground. The white  horse contentedly went to munching dry blades of dusty grass.    \"Bob, I do believe you've been silly,\" said Betty, trying to speak  severely and failing completely because her dimple would deepen  distractingly. \"You know I told you not to do it.\"    \"How do you know what I've done?\" demanded Bob, placing a square  package in the girl's hands. \"Don't scold till you know what you're  scolding about.\"    Betty, busy with the cord and paper, paused.    \"Oh, Bob!\" she beamed, her vivid face glowing with a new thought.  \"What do you think? I had a letter yesterday from Bobby Littell, and  she's going to boarding school. And, Bob, so am I! Uncle Dick says so.  And, Bob--\"    \"Yes?\" smiled Bob, thinking how the girl's face changed as she talked.  \"Go on, Betty.\"    \"Well, Louise is going, too, and they think Libbie will come down  from Vermont. Dear old Libbie--I wonder if she is as incurably  romantic as ever!\"    Betty's fingers had worked mechanically while she spoke, and now she had  her parcel undone.    \"Why, Bob Henderson!\" she gasped, as she drew out a handsome white box  tied with pale blue ribbons and encased in waxed paper.    \"I hope they're not stale,\" said Bob diffidently.    Betty slit the waxed paper and took off the box lid, revealing a  perfectly packed box of expensive chocolates.    \"They're beautiful,\" she declared. \"But I never dreamed you would send  East for 'em simply because I happened to say I was hungry for good  candy. Um--um--taste one quick, Bob.\"    Bob took a caramel and pronounced it not \"half bad.\"    \"Uncle Dick's gone somewhere with Dave Thorne,\" announced Betty, biting  into another candy. \"He didn't know when he would get back, and I'm  supposed to ride to the Watterby farm for lunch. It must be after  eleven now.\"    \"Miss Betty!\" Lee Chang's voice was persuasive. \"Miss Betty, that apple  tart he all baked done now.\"    \"Apple tart?\" shouted Bob. \"Show me, Lee Chang! I'd rather have a corner  of your pie than all the candy in New York.\"    \"Him for Miss Betty,\" said the Chinaman gravely.    \"But you don't care if I give Bob some, do you?\" returned Betty  coaxingly. \"See, Lee Chang, Bob gave me these. You take some, and we'll  eat the tart on our way home.\"    Lee Chang's wish was fulfilled when he placed the flaky tart in  Betty's hands, and he took a candy or two (which he privately  considered rather poor stuff) and watched the girl no longer. From now  on till dinner time Lee Chang's whole attention would be concentrated  on the preparation of an excellent dinner for the men who worked that  section of the oil fields.    \"I don't believe I can ride and eat this, after all,\" decided Betty.  \"Let's sit down on the grass and finish it; Clover hasn't finished her  lunch, either.\"    The little bay horse and the tall, shambling white were amiably straying  up and down the narrow borders of the road, never getting very far away.    \"You haven't said a single word about my going to boarding school, Bob,\"  Betty said, dropping down comfortably on the dusty grass and breaking the  tart across into two nearly even pieces. \"There--take your pie. Don't you  think I'll have fun with the Littell girls?\"    \"You'll have a lark, but I'm not so sure about the teachers,\" declared  Bob enthusiastically, an odd little smile quivering on his lips. \"With  you and Bobby Littell about, I doubt if the school knows a dull moment.\"    \"Bobby is so funny,\" dimpled Betty. \"She writes that if Libbie comes, her  aunt expects Bobby to look after her. Wait a minute and I'll read you  that part--\" Betty took a letter from the pocket of her blouse.  \"Listen--    \"Aunt Elizabeth has written mother that she hopes I will keep an eye on  Libbie. Now Betty, can you honestly see me trailing around after that  girl who sees a romance in every bush and book and who cries when any one  plays violin music? I'll look after her all right--she'll have to study  French instead of poetry if I'm to be her friend and guide.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"But, of course, Bobby does really love Libbie very dearly,\" said Betty,  folding up the letter and returning it to her pocket. \"She wouldn't hurt  her for worlds.\"    \"You'll be a much better guardian for Libbie, if she needs one,\"  pronounced Bob, with unexpected shrewdness. \"Bobby hasn't much tact,  and she makes Libbie mad. You could probably control her better with  less words.\"    \"Well, I never!\" gasped Betty, gazing at Bob with new respect. \"I never  knew you thought anything about it.\"    \"Didn't until just now,\" responded Bob cheerfully. \"So Uncle Dick is  willing to let you go, is he? When do you start?\"    \"You don't mind, do you, Bob?\" countered Betty, puzzled. \"You sound so  kind of--of funny.\"    \"Don't mean to,\" said Bob laconically.    Having finished his tart, he lay back and rested his head in his hands in  true masculine contentment.    \"I like that blue thing you've got on,\" he commented lazily. \"Did I ever  see it before?\"    \"Certainly not,\" Betty informed him. \"I've been waiting for you to notice  it. It's wash silk, Bob, and your Aunt Faith said I could have it if I  could do anything with it. She's had it in a trunk for years and years.\"    \"I don't see how you and Aunt Faith could wear the same clothes, she's so  much taller than you are,\" said Bob, obviously trying to put two and two  together in his mind. \"But it looks fine on you, Betty.\"    Betty smiled at him compassionately.    \"Oh, Bob, you're so funny!\" she sighed. \"I made this blouse all  myself--that is,\" she corrected, \"Mrs. Watterby helped me cut it out and  she sewed the sleeves in after I had basted them in wrong twice, but I  did everything else. There wasn't a scrap of goods left over, either. I  put it on to-day because I wanted you to see me in it.\"    She was worth seeing, Bob acknowledged to himself. The over-blouse of  blue and white checked silk, slashed at the throat for the crisp black  tie, and the gray corduroy riding skirt and smart tan shoes were at once  suitable and becoming.    \"I'll have to have some new clothes for school,\" declared Betty, who had  a healthy interest in this topic. \"We can't wear very fussy things,  though--Bobby sent me the catalogue. Sailor suits for every day, and a  cloth frock for best. And not more than one party dress.\"    \"I asked her when she started,\" Bob confided to the blank eye of the  white horse now turned dully toward him. \"But if she answered me, I  didn't hear.\"    \"I'm going a week from this Friday,\" announced Betty hastily. \"That will  give me a week in Washington, and Mrs. Littell has asked me to stay with  them. I must write to Mrs. Bender to-night and tell her the news; she has  been so anxious for me to go to school again.\"    \"Oh, gee, Betty, that reminds me--\" Bob sat up with a jerk and began a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#1)"],[1,"BULL HUNTER    BY    MAX BRAND              BULL HUNTER    CHAPTER 1      It was the big central taproot which baffled them. They had hewed  easily through the great side roots, large as branches, covered with  soft brown bark; they had dug down and cut through the forest of  tender small roots below; but when they had passed the main body of  the stump and worked under it, they found that their hole around the  trunk was not large enough in diameter to enable them to reach to the  taproot and cut through it. They could only reach it feebly with the  hatchet, fraying it, but there was no chance for a free swing to sever  the tough wood. Instead of widening the hole at once, they kept  laboring at the root, working the stump back and forth, as though they  hoped to crystallize that stubborn taproot and snap it like a wire.  Still it held and defied them. They laid hold of it together and  tugged with a grunt; something tore beneath that effort, but the stump  held, and upward progress ceased.    They stopped, too tired for profanity, and gazed down the mountainside  after the manner of baffled men, who look far off from the thing that  troubles them. They could tell by the trees that it was a high  altitude. There were no cottonwoods, though the cottonwoods will  follow a stream for more than a mile above sea level. Far below them a  pale mist obscured the beautiful silver spruce which had reached their  upward limit. Around the cabin marched a scattering of the balsam fir.  They were nine thousand feet above the sea, at least. Still higher up  the sallow forest of lodgepole pines began; and above these, beyond  the timberline, rose the bald summit itself.    They were big men, framed for such a country, defying the roughness  with a roughness of their own--these stalwart sons of old Bill  Campbell. Both Harry and Joe Campbell were fully six feet tall, with  mighty bones and sinews and work-toughened muscles to justify their  stature. Behind them stood their home, a shack better suited for the  housing of cattle than of men. But such leather-skinned men as these  were more tender to their horses than to themselves. They slept and  ate in the shack, but they lived in the wind and the sun.    Although they had looked down the stern slopes to the lower Rockies,  they did not see the girl who followed the loosely winding trail. She  was partly sheltered by the firs and came out just above them. They  began moiling at the stump again, sweating, cursing, and the girl  halted her horse near by. The profanity did not distress her. She was  so accustomed to it that the words had lost all edge and point for  her; but her freckled face stirred to a smile of pleasure at the sight  of their strength, as they alternately smote at the taproot and then  strove in creaking, grunting unison to work it loose.    They remained so long oblivious of her presence that at length she  called, \"Why don't you dig a bigger hole, boys?\"    She laughed in delight as they jerked up their heads in astonishment.  Her laughter was young and sweet to the ear, but there was not a great  deal outside her laughter that was attractive about her.    However, Joe and Harry gaped and grinned and blushed at her in the  time-old fashion, for she lived in a country where to be a woman is  sufficient, beauty is an unnecessary luxury, soon taxed out of  existence by the life. She possessed the main essentials of social  power; she could dance unflaggingly from dark to dawn at the nearest  schoolhouse dance, chattering every minute; and she could maintain a  rugged silence from dawn to dark again, as she rode her pony home.    Harry Campbell took off his hat, not in politeness, but to scratch his  head. \"Say, Jessie, where'd you drop from? Didn't see you coming  no ways.\"    \"Maybe I come down like rain,\" said Jessie.    All three laughed heartily at this jest.    Jessie swung sidewise in her saddle with the lithe grace of a boy,  dropped her elbow on the high pommel, and gave advice. \"You got a  pretty bad taproot under yonder. Better chop out a bigger hole, boys.  But, say, what you clearing this here land for? Ain't no good for  nothing, is it?\" She looked around her. Here and there the clearing  around the shanty ate raggedly into the forest, but still the plowed  land was chopped up with a jutting of boulders.    \"Sure it ain't no good for nothing,\" said Joe. \"It's just the old  man's idea.\"    He jerked a grimy thumb over his shoulder to indicate the controlling  and absent power of the old man, somewhere in the woods.    \"Sure makes him glum when we ain't working. If they ain't nothing  worthwhile to do he always sets us to grubbing up roots; and if we  ain't diggin' up roots, we got to get out old 'Maggie' mare and try to  plow. Plow in rocks like them! Nobody but Bull can do it.\"    \"I didn't know Bull could do nothing,\" said the girl with interest.    \"Aw, he's a fool, right enough,\" said Harry, \"but he just has a sort  of head for knowing where the rocks are under the ground, and somehow  he seems to make old Maggie hoss know where they lie, too. Outside of  that he sure ain't no good. Everybody knows that.\"    \"Kind of too bad he ain't got no brains,\" said the girl. \"All his  strength is in his back, and none is in his head, my dad says. If he  had some part of sense he'd be a powerful good hand.\"    \"Sure would be,\" agreed Harry. \"But he ain't no good now. Give him an  ax maybe, and he hits one or two wallopin' licks with it and then  stands and rests on the handle and starts to dreaming like a fool.  Same way with everything. But, say, Joe, maybe he could start this  stump out of the hole.\"    \"But I seen you both try to get the stump up,\" said the girl in  wonder.    \"Get Bull mad and he can lift a pile,\" Joe assured her. \"Go find him,  Harry.\"    Harry obediently shouted, \"Bull! Oh, Bull!\"    There was no answer.    \"Most like he's reading,\" observed Joe. \"He don't never hear nothing  then. Go look for him, Harry.\"    Big Harry strode to the door of the hut.    \"How come he understands books?\" said the girl. \"I couldn't never make  nothing out of 'em.\"    \"Me neither,\" agreed Joe in sympathy. \"But maybe Bull don't  understand. He just likes to read because he can sit still and do it.  Never was a lazier gent than Bull.\"    Harry turned at the door of the shack. \"Yep, reading,\" he announced  with disgust. He cupped his hands over his mouth and bellowed through  the doorway, \"Hey!\"    There was a startled grunt within, a deep, heavy voice and a thick  articulation. Presently a huge man came into the doorway and leaned  there, his figure filling it. There was nothing freakish about his  build. He was simply over-normal in bulk, from the big head to the  heavy feet. He was no more than a youth in age, but the great size and  the bewildered puckering of his forehead made him seem older. The book  was still in his hand.    \"Hey,\" returned Harry, \"we didn't call you out here to read to us.  Leave the book behind!\"    Bull looked down at the book in his hand, seemed to waken from a  trance, then, with a muffled sound of apology, dropped the book  behind him.    \"Come here!\"    He slumped out from the house. His gait was like his body, his stride  large and loose. The lack of nervous energy which kept his mind from a  high tension was shown again in the heavy fall of his feet and the  forward slump of his head. His hands dangled aimlessly at his sides,  as though in need of occupation. A ragged thatch of blond hair covered  his head and it was sunburned to straw color at the edges.    His costume was equally rough. He wore no belt, but one strap, from  his right hip, crossed behind his back, over the bulging muscles of  his shoulder to the front of his left hip. The trousers, which this  simple brace supported, were patched overalls, frayed to loose threads  halfway down the calf where they were met by the tops of immense  cowhide boots. As for the shirt, the sleeves were inches too short,  and the unbuttoned cuffs flapped around the burly forearms. If it had  been fastened together at the throat he would have choked. He seemed,  in a word, to be bulging out of his clothes. One expected a mighty  rending if he made a strong effort.    This bulk of a man slouched forward with steps both huge and hesitant,  pausing between them. When he saw the girl he stopped short, and his  brow puckered more than before. One felt that, coming from the shadow,  he was dazed and startled by the brilliant mountain sunshine; and the  eyes were dull and alarmed. It was a handsome face in a way, but a  little too heavy with flesh, too inert, like the rest of his body and  his muscular movements.    \"She ain't going to bite you,\" said Harry Campbell. \"Come on over here  to the stump.\" He whispered to the girl, \"Laugh at him!\"    She obeyed his command. It brought a flush to the face of Bull Hunter  and made his head bow. He shuffled to the stump and stood aimlessly  beside it.    \"Get down into the hole, you fool!\" ordered Joe.    He and Harry took a certain pride in ordering their cousin around. It  was like performing with a lion in the presence of a lady; it was  manipulating an elephant by power of the unaided voice. Slowly Bull  Hunter dropped his great feet into the hole and then raised his head a  little and looked wistfully to the brothers for further orders.    But only half his mind was with them. The other half was with the  story in the book. There Quentin Durward had been nodding at his guard  in the castle, and the evil-faced little king had just sprung out and  wrenched the weapon from the hands of the sleepy boy. Bull Hunter  could see the story clearly, very clearly. The scar on the face of Le  Balafré glistened for him; he had veritably tasted the little round  loaves of French bread that the adventurer had eaten with the  pseudo-merchant.    But to step out of that world of words into this keen sunlight--ah,  there was the"]]]
