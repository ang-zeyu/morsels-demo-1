Desmalions, the Prefect of Police, was not yet  back at the office. His private secretary laid on the desk a bundle of  letters and reports which he had annotated for his chief, rang the bell  and said to the messenger who entered by the main door:    \"Monsieur le Prefet has sent for a number of people to see him at five  o'clock. Here are their names. Show them into separate waiting-rooms, so  that they can't communicate with one another, and let me have their cards  when they come.\"    The messenger went out. The secretary was turning toward the small door  that led to his room, when the main door opened once more and admitted a  man who stopped and leaned swaying over the back of a chair.    \"Why, it's you, Verot!\" said the secretary. \"But what's happened? What's  the matter?\"    Inspector Verot was a very stout, powerfully built man, with a big neck  and shoulders and a florid complexion. He had obviously been upset by  some violent excitement, for his face, streaked with red veins and  usually so apoplectic, seemed almost pale.    \"Oh, nothing, Monsieur le Secretaire!\" he said.    \"Yes, yes; you're not looking your usual self. You're gray in the  face.... And the way you're perspiring....\"    Inspector Verot wiped his forehead and, pulling himself together, said:    \"It's just a little tiredness.... I've been overworking myself lately: I  was very keen on clearing up a case which Monsieur Desmalions had put in  my hands. All the same, I have a funny sort of feeling--\"    \"Will you have a pick-me-up?\"    \"No, no; I'm more thirsty.\"    \"A glass of water?\"    \"No, thank you.\"    \"What then?\"    \"I should like--I should like--\"    His voice faltered. He wore a troubled look, as if he had suddenly lost  his power of getting out another word. But he recovered himself with an  effort and asked:    \"Isn't Monsieur Desmalions here?\"    \"No; he won't be back till five, when he has an important meeting.\"    \"Yes ... I know ... most important. That's what I'm here for. But  I should have liked to see him first. I should so much have liked  to see him!\"    The secretary stared at Verot and said:    \"What a state you're in! Is your message so urgent as all that?\"    \"It's very urgent, indeed. It has to do with a crime that took place a  month ago, to the day. And, above all, it's a matter of preventing two  murders which are the outcome of that other crime and which are to be  committed to-night. Yes, to-night, inevitably, unless we take the  necessary steps.\"    \"Sit down, Verot, won't you?\"    \"You see, the whole thing has been planned in such an infernal manner!  You would never have imagined--\"    \"Still, Verot, as you know about it beforehand, and as Monsieur le Prefet  is sure to give you full powers--\"    \"Yes, of course, of course. But, all the same, it's terrible to think  that I might miss him. So I wrote him this letter, telling him all I know  about the business. I thought it safer.\"    He handed the secretary a large yellow envelope and added:    \"And here's a little box as well; I'll leave it on this table. It  contains something that will serve to complete and explain the contents  of the letter.\"    \"But why don't you keep all that by you?\"    \"I'm afraid to. They're watching me. They're trying to get rid of  me. I shan't be easy in my mind until some one besides myself knows  the secret.\"    \"Have no fear, Verot. Monsieur le Prefet is bound to be back soon.  Meanwhile, I advise you to go to the infirmary and ask for a pick-me-up.\"    The inspector seemed undecided what to do. Once more he wiped away the  perspiration that was trickling down his forehead. Then, drawing himself  up, he left the office. When he was gone the secretary slipped the letter  into a big bundle of papers that lay on the Prefect's desk and went out  by the door leading to his own room.    He had hardly closed it behind him when the other door opened once again  and the inspector returned, spluttering:    \"Monsieur le Secretaire ... it'd be better if I showed you--\"    The unfortunate man was as white as a sheet. His teeth were chattering.  When he saw that the secretary was gone, he tried to walk across to his  private room. But he was seized with an attack of weakness and sank into  a chair, where he remained for some minutes, moaning helplessly:    \"What's the matter with me? ... Have I been poisoned, too? ... Oh, I  don't like this; I don't like the look of this!\"    The desk stood within reach of his hand. He took a pencil, drew a  writing-pad toward him and began to scribble a few characters. But he  next stammered:    \"Why, no, it's not worth while. The Prefect will be reading my  letter.... What on earth's the matter with me. I don't like this at all!\"    Suddenly he rose to his feet and called out:    \"Monsieur le Secretaire, we've got ... we've got to ... It's for  to-night. Nothing can prevent--\"    Stiffening himself with an effort of his whole will, he made for the door  of the secretary's room with little short steps, like an automaton. But  he reeled on the way--and had to sit down a second time.    A mad terror shook him from head to foot; and he uttered cries which were  too faint, unfortunately, to be heard. He realized this and looked round  for a bell, for a gong; but he was no longer able to distinguish  anything. A veil of darkness seemed to weigh upon his eyes.    Then he dropped on his knees and crawled to the wall, beating the air  with one hand, like a blind man, until he ended by touching some  woodwork. It was the partition-wall.    He crept along this; but, as ill-luck would have it, his bewildered brain  showed him a false picture of the room, so that, instead of turning to  the left as he should have done, he followed the wall to the right,  behind a screen which concealed a third door.    His fingers touched the handle of this door and he managed to open it. He  gasped, \"Help! Help!\" and fell at his full length in a sort of cupboard  or closet which the Prefect of Police used as a dressing-room.    \"To-night!\" he moaned, believing that he was making himself heard and  that he was in the secretary's room. \"To-night! The job is fixed for  to-night! You'll see ... The mark of the teeth! ... It's awful! ... Oh,  the pain I'm in! ... It's the poison! Save me! Help!\"    The voice died away. He repeated several times, as though in a nightmare:    \"The teeth! the teeth! They're closing!\"    Then his voice grew fainter still; and inarticulate sounds issued from  his pallid lips. His mouth munched the air like the mouth of one of those  old men who seem to be interminably chewing the cud. His head sank lower  and lower on his breast. He heaved two or three sighs; a great shiver  passed through his body; and he moved no more.    And the death-rattle began in his throat, very softly and rhythmically,  broken only by interruptions in which a last instinctive effort appeared  to revive the flickering life of the intelligence, and to rouse fitful  gleams of consciousness in the dimmed eyes.    The Prefect of Police entered his office at ten minutes to five. M.  Desmalions, who had filled his post for the past three years with an  authority that made him generally respected, was a heavily built man of  fifty with a shrewd and intelligent face. His dress, consisting of a gray  jacket-suit, white spats, and a loosely flowing tie, in no way suggested  the public official. His manners were easy, simple, and full of  good-natured frankness.    He touched a bell, and when his secretary entered, asked:    \"Are the people whom I sent for here?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, and I gave orders that they were to wait in  different rooms.\"    \"Oh, it would not have mattered if they had met! However, perhaps it's  better as it is. I hope that the American Ambassador did not trouble to  come in person?\"    \"No, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Have you their cards?\"    \"Yes.\"    The Prefect of Police took the five visiting cards which his secretary  handed him and read:    \"Mr. Archibald Bright, First Secretary United States Embassy; Ma√Ætre  Lepertuis, Solicitor; Juan Caceres, Attache to the Peruvian Legation;  Major Comte d'Astrignac, retired.\"    The fifth card bore merely a name, without address or quality of  any kind--    DON LUIS PERENNA    \"That's the one I'm curious to see!\" said M. Desmalions. \"He interests me  like the very devil! Did you read the report of the Foreign Legion?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, and I confess that this gentleman  puzzles me, too.\"    \"He does, eh? Did you ever hear of such pluck? A sort of heroic madman,  something absolutely wonderful! And then there's that nickname of Arsene  Lupin which he earned among his messmates for the way in which he used  to boss them and astound them! ... How long is it since the death of  Arsene Lupin?\"    \"It happened two years before your appointment, Monsieur le Prefet. His  corpse and Mme.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.      Since undertaking the translation of Dr. Ludwig Nohl's valuable edition of  \"Beethoven's Letters,\" an additional collection has been published by Dr.  Ludwig Ritter von Koechel, consisting of many interesting letters addressed  by Beethoven to his illustrious pupil, H.R.H. the Archduke Rudolph,  Cardinal-Archbishop of Olmuetz. These I have inserted in chronological  order, and marked with the letter K., in order to distinguish them from the  correspondence edited by Dr. Nohl. I have only omitted a few brief notes,  consisting merely of apologies for non-attendance on the Archduke.    The artistic value of these newly discovered treasures will no doubt be as  highly appreciated in this country as in the great _maestro's_ Father-land.    I must also express my gratitude to Dr. Th.G. v. Karajan, for permitting an  engraving to be made expressly for this work, from an original Beethoven  portrait in his possession, now for the first time given to the public. The  grand and thoughtful countenance forms a fitting introduction to letters so  truly depicting the brilliant, fitful genius of the sublime master, as well  as the touching sadness and gloom pervading his life, which his devotion to  Art alone brightened, through many bitter trials and harassing cares.    The love of Beethoven's music is now become so universal in England, that I  make no doubt his Letters will receive a hearty welcome from all those  whose spirits have been elevated and soothed by the genius of this  illustrious man.    GRACE WALLACE.    AINDERBY HALL, March 28, 1866.          PREFACE    BY DR. LUDWIG NOHL    TO THE    LETTERS OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      In accompanying the present edition of the Letters of Ludwig van Beethoven  with a few introductory remarks, I at once acknowledge that the compilation  of these letters has cost me no slight sacrifices. I must also, however,  mention that an unexpected Christmas donation, generously bestowed on me  with a view to further my efforts to promote the science of music, enabled  me to undertake one of the journeys necessary for my purpose, and also to  complete the revision of the Letters and of the press, in the milder air  and repose of a country residence, long since recommended to me for the  restoration of my health, undermined by overwork.    That, in spite of every effort, I have not succeeded in seeing the original  of each letter, or even discovering the place where it exists, may well be  excused, taking into consideration the slender capabilities of an  individual, and the astonishing manner in which Beethoven's Letters are  dispersed all over the world. At the same time, I must state that not only  have the hitherto inaccessible treasures of Anton Schindler's \"Beethoven's  Nachlass\" been placed at my disposal, but also other letters from private  sources, owing to various happy chances, and the kindness and complaisance  of collectors of autographs. I know better, however, than most  people--being in a position to do so--that in the present work there can be  no pretension to any thing approaching to a complete collection of  Beethoven's Letters. The master, so fond of writing, though he often rather  amusingly accuses himself of being a lazy correspondent, may very probably  have sent forth at least double the amount of the letters here given, and  there is no doubt whatever that a much larger number are still extant in  the originals. The only thing that can be done at this moment, however, is  to make the attempt to bring to light, at all events, the letters that  could be discovered in Germany. The mass of those which I gradually  accumulated, and now offer to the public (with the exception of some  insignificant notes), appeared to me sufficiently numerous and important to  interest the world, and also to form a substantial nucleus for any letters  that may hereafter be discovered. On the other hand, as many of Beethoven's  Letters slumber in foreign lands, especially in the unapproachable cabinets  of curiosities belonging to various close-fisted English collectors, an  entire edition of the correspondence could only be effected by a most  disproportionate outlay of time and expense.    When revising the text of the Letters, it seemed to me needless perpetually  to impair the pleasure of the reader by retaining the mistakes in  orthography; but enough of the style of writing of that day is adhered to,  to prevent its peculiar charm being entirely destroyed. Distorted and  incorrect as Beethoven's mode of expression sometimes is, I have not  presumed to alter his grammar, or rather syntax, in the smallest degree:  who would presume to do so with an individuality which, even amid startling  clumsiness of style, displays those inherent intellectual powers that often  did violence to language as well as to his fellow-men? Cyclopean masses of  rock are here hurled with Cyclopean force; but hard and massive as they  are, the man is not to be envied whose heart is not touched by these  glowing fragments, flung apparently at random right and left, like meteors,  by a mighty intellectual being, however perverse the treatment language may  have received from him.    The great peculiarity, however, in this strange mode of expression is, that  even such incongruous language faithfully reflects the mind of the man  whose nature was of prophetic depth and heroic force; and who that knows  anything of the creative genius of a Beethoven can deny him these  attributes?    The antique dignity pervading the whole man, the ethical contemplation of  life forming the basis of his nature, prevented even a momentary wish on my  part to efface a single word of the oft-recurring expressions so painfully  harsh, bordering on the unaesthetic, and even on the repulsive, provoked by  his wrath against the meanness of men. In the last part of these genuine  documents, we learn with a feeling of sadness, and with almost a tragic  sensation, how low was the standard of moral worth, or rather how great was  the positive unworthiness, of the intimate society surrounding the master,  and with what difficulty he could maintain the purity of the nobler part of  his being in such an atmosphere. The manner, indeed, in which he strives to  do so, fluctuating between explosions of harshness and almost weak  yieldingness, while striving to master the base thoughts and conduct of  these men, though never entirely succeeding in doing so, is often more a  diverting than an offensive spectacle. In my opinion, nevertheless, even  this less pleasing aspect of the Letters ought not to be in the slightest  degree softened (which it has hitherto been, owing to false views of  propriety and morality), for it is no moral deformity here displayed.  Indeed, even when the irritable master has recourse to expressions  repugnant to our sense of conventionality, and which may well be called  harsh and rough, still the wrath that seizes on our hero is a just and  righteous wrath, and we disregard it, just as in Nature, whose grandeur  constantly elevates us above the inevitable stains of an earthly soil. The  coarseness and ill-breeding, which would claim toleration because this  great man now and then showed such feelings, must beware of doing so, being  certain to make shipwreck when coming in contact with the massive rock of  true morality on which, with all his faults and deficiencies, Beethoven's  being was surely grounded. Often, indeed, when absorbed in the  unsophisticated and genuine utterances of this great man, it seems as if  these peculiarities and strange asperities were the results of some  mysterious law of Nature, so that we are inclined to adopt the paradox by  which a wit once described the singular groundwork of our nature,--\"The  faults of man are the night in which he rests from his virtues.\"    Indeed, I think that the lofty morality of such natures is not fully  evident until we are obliged to confess with regret, that even the great  ones of the earth must pay their tribute to humanity, and really do pay it  (which is the distinction between them and base and petty characters),  without being ever entirely hurled from their pedestal of dignity and  virtue. The soul of that man cannot fail to be elevated, who can seize the  real spirit of the scattered pages that a happy chance has preserved for  us. If not fettered by petty feelings, he will quickly surmount the casual  obstacles and stumbling-blocks which the first perusal of these Letters may  seem to present, and quickly feel himself transported at a single stride  into a stream, where a strange roaring and rushing is heard, but above  which loftier tones resound with magic and exciting power. For a peculiar  life breathes in these lines; an under-current runs through their  apparently unconnected import, uniting them as with an electric chain, and  with firmer links than any mere coherence of subjects could have effected.  I experienced this myself, to the most remarkable degree, when I first made  the attempt to arrange, in accordance with their period and substance, the  hundreds of individual pages bearing neither date nor address, and I was  soon convinced that a connecting text (such as Mozart's Letters have, and  ought to have) would be here entirely superfluous, as even the best  biographical commentary would be very dry work, interrupting the electric  current of the whole, and thus destroying its peculiar effect.    And now, what is this spirit which, for an intelligent mind, binds together  these"]]]
