AUSTIN FREEMAN          PREFACE    In writing the following story, the author has had in view no purpose  other than that of affording entertainment to such readers as are  interested in problems of crime and their solutions; and the story  itself differs in no respect from others of its class, excepting in that  an effort has been made to keep within the probabilities of ordinary  life, both in the characters and in the incidents.    Nevertheless it may happen that the book may serve a useful purpose in  drawing attention to certain popular misapprehensions on the subject of  finger-prints and their evidential value; misapprehensions the extent of  which may be judged when we learn from the newspapers that several  Continental commercial houses have actually substituted finger-prints  for signed initials.    The facts and figures contained in Mr. Singleton's evidence, including  the very liberal estimate of the population of the globe, are, of  course, taken from Mr. Galton's great and important work on  finger-prints; to which the reader who is interested in the subject is  referred for much curious and valuable information.    In conclusion, the author desires to express his thanks to his friend  Mr. Bernard E. Bishop for the assistance rendered to him in certain  photographic experiments, and to those officers of the Central Criminal  Court who very kindly furnished him with details of the procedure in  criminal trials.

Fabricatam Anno 1698. Richardo Powell Armiger  Thesaurar.\" The words, set in four panels, which formed a frieze beneath  the pediment of a fine brick portico, summarised the history of one of  the tall houses at the upper end of King's Bench Walk and as I, somewhat  absently, read over the inscription, my attention was divided between  admiration of the exquisitely finished carved brickwork and the quiet  dignity of the building, and an effort to reconstitute the dead and gone  Richard Powell, and the stirring times in which he played his part.    I was about to turn away when the empty frame of the portico became  occupied by a figure, and one so appropriate, in its wig and obsolete  habiliments, to the old-world surroundings that it seemed to complete  the picture, and I lingered idly to look at it. The barrister had halted  in the doorway to turn over a sheaf of papers that he held in his hand,  and, as he replaced the red tape which bound them together, he looked up  and our eyes met. For a moment we regarded one another with the  incurious gaze that casual strangers bestow on one another; then there  was a flash of mutual recognition; the impassive and rather severe face  of the lawyer softened into a genial smile, and the figure, detaching  itself from its frame, came down the steps with a hand extended in  cordial greeting.    \"My dear Jervis,\" he exclaimed, as we clasped hands warmly, \"this is a  great and delightful surprise. How often have I thought of my old  comrade and wondered if I should ever see him again, and lo! here he is,  thrown up on the sounding beach of the Inner Temple, like the proverbial  bread cast upon the waters.\"    \"Your surprise, Thorndyke, is nothing to mine,\" I replied, \"for your  bread has at least returned as bread; whereas I am in the position of a  man who, having cast his bread upon the waters, sees it return in the  form of a buttered muffin or a Bath bun. I left a respectable medical  practitioner and I find him transformed into a bewigged and begowned  limb of the law.\"    Thorndyke laughed at the comparison.    \"Liken not your old friend unto a Bath bun,\" said he. \"Say, rather, that  you left him a chrysalis and come back to find him a butterfly. But the  change is not so great as you think. Hippocrates is only hiding under  the gown of Solon, as you will understand when I explain my  metamorphosis; and that I will do this very evening, if you have no  engagement.\"    \"I am one of the unemployed at present,\" I said, \"and quite at your  service.\"    \"Then come round to my chambers at seven,\" said Thorndyke, \"and we will  have a chop and a pint of claret together and exchange autobiographies.  I am due in court in a few minutes.\"    \"Do you reside within that noble old portico?\" I asked.    \"No,\" replied Thorndyke. \"I often wish I did. It would add several  inches to one's stature to feel that the mouth of one's burrow was  graced with a Latin inscription for admiring strangers to ponder over.  No; my chambers are some doors further down--number 6A\"--and he turned  to point out the house as we crossed towards Crown Office Row.    At the top of Middle Temple Lane we parted, Thorndyke taking his way  with fluttering gown towards the Law Courts, while I directed my steps  westward towards Adam Street, the chosen haunt of the medical agent.    The soft-voiced bell of the Temple clock was telling out the hour of  seven in muffled accents (as though it apologised for breaking the  studious silence) as I emerged from the archway of Mitre Court and  turned into King's Bench Walk.    The paved footway was empty save for a single figure, pacing slowly  before the doorway of number 6A, in which, though the wig had now given  place to a felt hat and the gown to a jacket, I had no difficulty in  recognising my friend.    \"Punctual to the moment, as of old,\" said he, meeting me half-way. \"What  a blessed virtue is punctuality, even in small things. I have just been  taking the air in Fountain Court, and will now introduce you to my  chambers. Here is my humble retreat.\"    We passed in through the common entrance and ascended the stone stairs  to the first floor, where we were confronted by a massive door, above  which my friend's name was written in white letters.  \"Rather a  forbidding exterior,\" remarked Thorndyke, as he inserted the latchkey,  \"but it is homely enough inside.\"    The heavy door swung outwards and disclosed a baize-covered inner door,  which Thorndyke pushed open and held for me to pass in.    \"You will find my chambers an odd mixture,\" said Thorndyke, \"for they  combine the attractions of an office, a museum, a laboratory and a  workshop.\"    \"And a restaurant,\" added a small, elderly man, who was decanting a  bottle of claret by means of a glass syphon: \"you forgot that, sir.\"    \"Yes, I forgot that, Polton,\" said Thorndyke, \"but I see you have not.\"  He glanced towards a small table that had been placed near the fire and  set out with the requisites for our meal.    \"Tell me,\" said Thorndyke, as we made the initial onslaught on the  products of Polton's culinary experiments, \"what has been happening to  you since you left the hospital six years ago?\"    \"My story is soon told,\" I answered, somewhat bitterly. \"It is not an  uncommon one. My funds ran out, as you know, rather unexpectedly. When I  had paid my examination and registration fees the coffer was absolutely  empty, and though, no doubt, a medical diploma contains--to use  Johnson's phrase--the potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams of  avarice, there is a vast difference in practice between the potential  and the actual. I have, in fact, been earning a subsistence, sometimes  as an assistant, sometimes as a _locum tenens_. Just now I've got no  work to do, and so have entered my name on Turcival's list of  eligibles.\"    Thorndyke pursed up his lips and frowned.    \"It's a wicked shame, Jervis,\" said he presently, \"that a man of your  abilities and scientific acquirements should be frittering away his  time on odd jobs like some half-qualified wastrel.\"    \"It is,\" I agreed. \"My merits are grossly undervalued by a stiff-necked  and obtuse generation. But what would you have, my learned brother? If  poverty steps behind you and claps the occulting bushel over your thirty  thousand candle-power luminary, your brilliancy is apt to be obscured.\"    \"Yes, I suppose that is so,\" grunted Thorndyke, and he remained for a  time in deep thought.    \"And now,\" said I, \"let us have your promised explanation. I am  positively frizzling with curiosity to know what chain of circumstances  has converted John Evelyn Thorndyke from a medical practitioner into a  luminary of the law.\"    Thorndyke smiled indulgently.    \"The fact is,\" said he, \"that no such transformation has occurred. John  Evelyn Thorndyke is still a medical practitioner.\"    \"What, in a wig and gown!\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes, a mere sheep in wolf's clothing,\" he replied. \"I will tell you how  it has come about. After you left the hospital, six years ago, I stayed  on, taking up any small appointments that were going--assistant  demonstrator--or curatorships and such like--hung about the chemical and  physical laboratories, the museum and post mortem room, and meanwhile  took my M.D. and D.Sc. Then I got called to the bar in the hope of  getting a coronership, but soon after this, old Stedman retired  unexpectedly--you remember Stedman, the lecturer on medical  jurisprudence--and I put in for the vacant post. Rather to my surprise,  I was appointed lecturer, whereupon I dismissed the coronership from my  mind, took my present chambers and sat down to wait for anything that  might come.\"  \"And what has come?\" I asked.    \"Why, a very curious assortment of miscellaneous practice,\" he replied.  \"At first I only got an occasional analysis in a doubtful poisoning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#1)"],[1,"Hero    By E.W.

Number Three          No Hero      CHAPTER I    A PLENIPOTENTIARY      Has no writer ever dealt with the dramatic aspect of the unopened  envelope? I cannot recall such a passage in any of my authors, and yet  to my mind there is much matter for philosophy in what is always the  expressionless shell of a boundless possibility. Your friend may run  after you in the street, and you know at a glance whether his news is to  be good, bad, or indifferent; but in his handwriting on the  breakfast-table there is never a hint as to the nature of his  communication. Whether he has sustained a loss or an addition to his  family, whether he wants you to dine with him at the club or to lend him  ten pounds, his handwriting at least will be the same, unless, indeed,  he be offended, when he will generally indite your name with a studious  precision and a distant grace quite foreign to his ordinary caligraphy.    These reflections, trite enough as I know, are nevertheless inevitable  if one is to begin one's unheroic story in the modern manner, at the  latest possible point. That is clearly the point at which a waiter  brought me the fatal letter from Catherine Evers. Apart even from its  immediate consequences, the letter had a _prima facie_ interest, of no  ordinary kind, as the first for years from a once constant  correspondent. And so I sat studying the envelope with a curiosity too  piquant not to be enjoyed. What in the world could so obsolete a friend  find to say to one now? Six months earlier there had been a certain  opportunity for an advance, which at that time could not possibly have  been misconstrued; when they landed me, a few later, there was another  and perhaps a better one. But this was the last summer of the late  century, and already I was beginning to get about like a lamplighter on  my two sticks. Now, young men about town, on two walking-sticks, in the  year of grace 1900, meant only one thing. Quite a stimulating thing in  the beginning, but even as I write, in this the next winter but one, a  national irritation of which the name alone might prevent you from  reading another word.    Catherine's handwriting, on the contrary, was still stimulating, if  indeed I ever found it more so in the foolish past. It had not altered  in the least. There was the same sweet pedantry of the Attic _e_, the  same superiority to the most venial abbreviation, the same inconsistent  forest of exclamatory notes, thick as poplars across the channel. The  present plantation started after my own Christian name, to wit \"Dear  Duncan!!\" Yet there was nothing Germanic in Catherine's ancestry; it was  only her apologetic little way of addressing me as though nothing had  ever happened, of asking whether she might. Her own old tact and charm  were in that tentative burial of the past. In the first line she had all  but won my entire forgiveness; but the very next interfered with the  effect.    \"You promised to do anything for me!\"    I should be sorry to deny it, I am sure, for not to this day do I know  what I did say on the occasion to which she evidently referred. But was  it kind to break the silence of years with such a reference? Was it even  quite decent in Catherine to ignore my existence until I could be of use  to her, and then to ask the favour in her first breath? It was true, as  she went on to remind me, that we were more or less connected after all,  and at least conceivable that no one else could help her as I could, if  I would. In any case, it was a certain satisfaction to hear that  Catherine herself was of the last opinion. I read on. She was in a  difficulty; but she did not say what the difficulty was. For one  unworthy moment the thought of money entered my mind, to be ejected the  next, as the Catherine of old came more and more into the mental focus.  Pride was the last thing in which I had found her wanting, and her  letter indicated no change in that respect.    \"You may wonder,\" she wrote just at the end, \"why I have never sent you  a single word of inquiry, or sympathy, or congratulation!!  Well--suppose it was 'bad blood'!! between us when you went away! Mind,  _I_ never meant it to be so, but suppose it was: could I treat the dear  old you like that, and the Great New You like somebody else? You have  your own fame to thank for my unkindness! _I_ am only thankful they  haven't given you the V.C.!! _Then_ I should _never_ have dared--not  even now!!!\"    I smoked a cigarette when I had read it all twice over, and as I crushed  the fire out of the stump I felt I could as soon think of lighting it  again as I should have expected Catherine Evers to set a fresh match to  me. That, I was resolved, she should never do; nor was I quite coxcomb  enough to suspect her of the desire for a moment. But a man who has once  made a fool of himself, especially about a woman somewhat older than  himself, does not soon get over the soreness; and mine returned with the  very fascination which made itself felt even in the shortest little  letter.    Catherine wrote from the old address in Elm Park Gardens, and she wanted  me to call as early as I could, or to make any appointment I liked. I  therefore telegraphed that I was coming at three o'clock that afternoon,  and thus made for myself one of the longest mornings that I can remember  spending in town. I was staying at the time at the Kensington Palace  Hotel, to be out of the central racket of things, and yet more or less  under the eye of the surgeon who still hoped to extract the last bullet  in time. I can remember spending half the morning gazing aimlessly over  the grand old trees, already prematurely bronzed, and the other half in  limping in their shadow to the Round Pond, where a few little townridden  boys were sailing their humble craft. It was near the middle of August,  and for the first time I was thankful that an earlier migration had not  been feasible in my case.    In spite of my telegram Mrs. Evers was not at home when I arrived, but  she had left a message which more than explained matters. She was  lunching out, but only in Brechin Place, and I was to wait in the study  if I did not mind. I did not, and yet I did, for the room in which  Catherine certainly read her books and wrote her letters was also the  scene of that which I was beginning to find it rather hard work to  forget as it was. Nor had it changed any more than her handwriting, or  than the woman herself as I confidently expected to find her now. I have  often thought that at about forty both sexes stand still to the eye, and  I did not expect Catherine Evers, who could barely have reached that  rubicon, to show much symptom of the later marches. To me, here in her  den, the other year was just the other day. My time in India was little  better than a dream to me, while as for angry shots at either end of  Africa, it was never I who had been there to hear them. I must have come  by my sticks in some less romantic fashion. Nothing could convince me  that I had ever been many days or miles away from a room that I knew by  heart, and found full as I left it of familiar trifles and poignant  associations.    That was the shelf devoted to her poets; there was no addition that I  could see. Over it hung the fine photograph of Watts's \"Hope,\" an ironic  emblem, and elsewhere one of that intolerably sad picture, his \"Paolo  and Francesca\": how I remembered the wet Sunday when Catherine took me  to see the original in Melbury Road! The old piano which was never  touched, the one which had been in St. Helena with Napoleon's doctor,  there it stood to an inch where it had stood of old, a sort of  grand-stand for the photographs of Catherine's friends. I descried my  own young effigy among the rest, in a frame which I recollected giving  her at the time. Well, I looked all the idiot I must have been; and  there was the very Persian rug that I had knelt on in my idiocy! I could  afford to smile at myself to-day; yet now it all seemed yesterday, not  even the day before, until of a sudden I caught sight of that other  photograph in the place of honour on the mantelpiece. It was one by  Hills and Sanders, of a tall youth in flannels, armed with a  long-handled racket, and the sweet open countenance which Robin Evers  had worn from his cradle upward. I should have known him anywhere and at  any age. It was the same dear, honest face; but to think that this giant  was little Bob! He had not gone to Eton when I saw him last; now I knew  from the sporting papers that he was up at Cambridge; but it was left to  his photograph to bring home the flight of time.    Certainly his mother would never have done so when all at once the door  opened and she stood before me, looking about thirty in the ample shadow  of a cavalier's hat. Simply but admirably gowned, as I knew she would  be, her slender figure looked more youthful still; yet in all this there  was no intent; the dry cool smile was that of an older woman, and I was  prepared for greater cordiality than I could honestly detect in the  greeting of the small firm hand. But it was kind, as indeed her whole  reception of me was; only it had always been the way of Catherine the  correspondent to make one expect a little more than mere kindness, and  of Catherine the companion to disappoint that expectation. Her  conversation needed few exclamatory points.    \"Still halt and lame,\" she murmured over my sticks. \"You poor thing, you  are to sit down this instant.\"    And I obeyed her as one always had, merely remarking that I was getting  along famously now.    \"You must have had an awful time,\" continued"]]]
