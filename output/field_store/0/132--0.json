In a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal, formerly styled the Palais  Cardinal, a man was sitting in deep reverie, his head supported on his  hands, leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with  letters and papers. Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive  with leaping flames; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the  polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments  of the lonely tenant of the room, which was illumined grandly by twin  candelabra rich with wax-lights.    Any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar--the  gorgeous robe of office--and the rich lace, or who gazed on that pale  brow, bent in anxious meditation, might, in the solitude of that  apartment, combined with the silence of the ante-chambers and the  measured paces of the guards upon the landing-place, have fancied that  the shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt.    It was, alas! the ghost of former greatness. France enfeebled, the  authority of her sovereign contemned, her nobles returning to their  former turbulence and insolence, her enemies within her frontiers--all  proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence.    In truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no  longer, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which  seemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a living  creature--from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts crowded  with guards--from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising from  the streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the room,  which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the  minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns  firing--let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to  the guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais  Royal, that the people were possessed of arms.    The shade of Richelieu was Mazarin. Now Mazarin was alone and  defenceless, as he well knew.    \"Foreigner!\" he ejaculated, \"Italian! that is their mean yet mighty  byword of reproach--the watchword with which they assassinated, hanged,  and made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would  assassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although  they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then.  Idiots! ignorant of their real enemies, they do not perceive that it is  not the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine  things to them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.    \"Yes, yes,\" Mazarin continued, whilst his wonted smile, full of  subtlety, lent a strange expression to his pale lips; \"yes, these noises  prove to me, indeed, that the destiny of favorites is precarious; but ye  shall know I am no ordinary favorite. No! The Earl of Essex, 'tis true,  wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him by his royal  mistress, whilst I--I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold, with a  cipher on it and a date; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of  the Palais Royal, * so they will never ruin me, as they long to do, and  whilst they shout, 'Down with Mazarin!' I, unknown, and unperceived by  them, incite them to cry out, 'Long live the Duke de Beaufort' one day;  another, 'Long live the Prince de Conde;' and again, 'Long live the  parliament!'\" And at this word the smile on the cardinal's lips assumed  an expression of hatred, of which his mild countenance seemed incapable.  \"The parliament! We shall soon see how to dispose,\" he continued, \"of  the parliament! Both Orleans and Montargis are ours. It will be a work  of time, but those who have begun by crying out: Down with Mazarin! will  finish by shouting out, Down with all the people I have mentioned, each  in his turn.        _* It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not_      _taken such vows as to prevent it, was secretly married to_      _Anne of Austria.--La Porte's Memoirs._    \"Richelieu, whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise  after his death, was even less popular than I am. Often he was driven  away, oftener still had he a dread of being sent away. The queen will  never banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she  would yield with me; if I fly, she will fly; and then we shall see how  the rebels will get on without either king or queen.    \"Oh, were I not a foreigner! were I but a Frenchman! were I but of  gentle birth!\"    The position of the cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had  added to his difficulties. Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks  of society in France. Crushed and impoverished by taxation--imposed by  Mazarin, whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very  dust--the people, as the Advocate-General Talon described it, had  nothing left to them except their souls; and as those could not be sold  by auction, they began to murmur. Patience had in vain been recommended  to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels,  however, were not meat and drink, and the people had for some time been  in a state of discontent.    Had this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for  when the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated  as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the  bourgeoisie, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily, Mazarin had  had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than  twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high price; and as  the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places, and as the  addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of  each place, the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves,  and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their  number, but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue; and should  any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance, to  combine to indemnify him for his loss.    Now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending  parties.

The Shadow of the Rope          CHAPTER I    THE END OF THEIR LIFE      \"It is finished,\" said the woman, speaking very quietly to herself. \"Not  another day, nor a night, if I can be ready before morning!\"    She stood alone in her own room, with none to mark the white-hot pallor  of the oval face, the scornful curve of quivering nostrils, the dry  lustre of flashing eyes. But while she stood a heavy step went  blustering down two flights of stairs, and double doors slammed upon the  ground floor.    It was a little London house, with five floors from basement to attic,  and a couple of rooms upon each, like most little houses in London; but  this one had latterly been the scene of an equally undistinguished drama  of real life, upon which the curtain was even now descending. Although a  third was whispered by the world, the persons of this drama were really  only two.    Rachel Minchin, before the disastrous step which gave her that surname,  was a young Australian lady whose apparent attractions were only  equalled by her absolute poverty; that is to say, she had been born at  Heidelberg, near Melbourne, of English parents more gentle than  practical, who soon left her to fight the world and the devil with no  other armory than a good face, a fine nature, and the pride of any  heiress. It is true that Rachel also had a voice; but there was never  enough of it to augur an income. At twenty, therefore, she was already a  governess in the wilds, where women are as scarce as water, but where  the man for Rachel did not breathe. A few years later she earned a berth  to England as companion to a lady; and her fate awaited her on board.    Mr. Minchin had reached his prime in the underworld, of which he also  was a native, without touching affluence, until his fortieth year.  Nevertheless, he was a travelled man, and no mere nomad of the bush. As  a mining expert he had seen much life in South Africa as well as in  Western Australia, but at last he was to see more in Europe as a  gentleman of means. A wife had no place in his European scheme; a  husband was the last thing Rachel wanted; but a long sea voyage, an  uncongenial employ, and the persistent chivalry of a handsome,  entertaining, self-confident man of the world, formed a combination as  fatal to her inexperience as that of so much poverty, pride, and beauty  proved to Alexander Minchin. They were married without ceremony on the  very day that they arrived in England, where they had not an actual  friend between them, nor a relative to whom either was personally known.  In the beginning this mattered nothing; they had to see Europe and enjoy  themselves; that they could do unaided; and the bride did it only the  more thoroughly, in a sort of desperation, as she realized that the  benefits of her marriage were to be wholly material after all.    In the larger life of cities, Alexander Minchin was no longer the idle  and good-humored cavalier to whom Rachel had learned to look for  unfailing consideration at sea. The illustrative incidents may be  omitted; but here he gambled, there he drank; and in his cups every  virtue dissolved. Rachel's pride did not mend matters; she was a thought  too ready with her resentment; of this, however, she was herself aware,  and would forgive the more freely because there was often some obvious  fault on her side before all was said. Quarrels of infinite bitterness  were thus patched up, and the end indefinitely delayed.    In the meantime, tired of travelling, and impoverished by the husband's  follies, the hapless couple returned to London, where a pure fluke with  some mining shares introduced Minchin to finer gambling than he had  found abroad. The man was bitten. There was a fortune waiting for  special knowledge and a little ready cash; and Alexander Minchin settled  down to make it, taking for the nonce a furnished house in a modest  neighborhood. And here it was that the quarrelling continued to its  culmination in the scene just ended.    \"Not another day,\" said Rachel, \"nor a night--if I can be ready before  morning!\"    Being still a woman with some strength of purpose, Mrs. Minchin did not  stop at idle words. The interval between the slamming of doors below and  another noise at the top of the house was not one of many minutes. The  other noise was made by Rachel and her empty trunk upon the loftiest and  the narrowest flight of stairs; one of the maids opened their door an  inch.    \"I am sorry if I disturbed you,\" their mistress said. \"These stairs are  so very narrow. No, thank you, I can manage quite well.\" And they heard  her about until they slept.    It was no light task to which Rachel had set her hand; she was going  back to Australia by the first boat, and her packing must be done that  night. Her resolve only hardened as her spirit cooled. The sooner her  departure, the less his opposition; let her delay, and the callousness  of the passing brute might give place to the tyranny of the normal man.  But she was going, whether or no; not another day--though she would  doubtless see its dawn. It was the month of September. And she was not  going to fly empty-handed, nor fly at all; she was going deliberately  away, with a trunk containing all that she should want upon the voyage.  The selection was not too easily made. In his better moods the creature  had been lavish enough; and more than once did Rachel snatch from drawer  or wardrobe that which remained some moments in her hand, while the  incidents of purchase and the first joys of possession, to one who had  possessed so little in her life, came back to her with a certain  poignancy.    But her resolve remained unshaken. It might hurt her to take his  personal gifts, but that was all she had ever had from him; he had never  granted her a set allowance; for every penny she must needs ask and look  grateful. It would be no fault of hers if she had to strip her fingers  for passage-money. Yet the exigency troubled her; it touched her honor,  to say nothing of her pride; and, after an unforeseen fit of  irresolution, Rachel suddenly determined to tell her husband of her  difficulty, making direct appeal to the capricious generosity which had  been recalled to her mind as an undeniably redeeming point. It was true  that he had given her hearty leave to go to the uttermost ends of the  earth, and highly probable that he would bid her work her own way. She  felt an impulse to put it to him, however, and at once.    She looked at her watch--it at least had been her mother's--and the  final day was already an hour old. But Alexander Minchin was a late  sitter, as his young wife knew to her cost, and to-night he had told her  where he meant to sleep, but she had not heard him come up. The room  would have been the back drawing-room in the majority of such houses,  and Rachel peeped in on her way down. It was empty; moreover, the bed  was not made, nor the curtains drawn. Rachel repaired the first  omission, then hesitated, finally creeping upstairs again for clean  sheets. And as she made his bed, not out of any lingering love for him,  but from a sense of duty and some consideration for his comfort, there  was yet something touching in her instinctive care, that breathed the  wife she could have been.    He did not hear her, though the stairs creaked the smallness of the  hour--or if he heard he made no sign. This discouraged Rachel as she  stole down the lower flight; she would have preferred the angriest sign.  But there were few internal sounds which penetrated to the little study  at the back of the dining-room, for the permanent tenant was the widow  of an eminent professor lately deceased, and that student had protected  his quiet with double doors. The outer one, in dark red baize, made an  alarming noise as Rachel pulled it open; but, though she waited, no  sound came from within; nor was Minchin disturbed by the final entry of  his wife, whose first glance convinced her of the cause. In the  professor's armchair sat his unworthy successor, chin on waistcoat, a  newspaper across his knees, an empty decanter at one elbow. Something  remained in the glass beside the bottle; he had tumbled off before the  end. There were even signs of deliberate preparations for slumber, for  the shade was tilted over the electric light by which he had been  reading, as a hat is tilted over the eyes.    Rachel had a touch of pity at seeing him in a chair for the night; but  the testimony of the decanter forbade remorse. She had filled it herself  in the evening against her husband's return from an absence of  mysterious length. Now she understood that mystery, and her face  "]]]
