By G---M---, F.T.S.    \"And Enoch walked with the Elohim, and the Elohim took him.\"  --Genesis    Introduction    [The curious information-for whatsoever else the world may think of it,  it will doubtless be acknowledged to be that--contained in the article  that follows, merits a few words of introduction. The details given in  it on the subject of what has always been considered as one of the  darkest and most strictly guarded of the mysteries of the initiation  into occultism--from the days of the Rishis until those of the  Theosophical Society--came to the knowledge of the author in a way that  would seem to the ordinary run of Europeans strange and supernatural.  He himself, however, we may assure the reader, is a most thorough  disbeliever in the Supernatural, though he has learned too much to limit  the capabilities of the natural as some do.  Further, he has to make the  following confession of his own belief.  It will be apparent, from a  careful perusal of the facts, that if the matter be really as stated  therein, the author cannot himself be an adept of high grade, as the  article in such a case would never have been written.  Nor does he  pretend to be one.  He is, or rather was, for a few years an humble  Chela. Hence, the converse must consequently be also true, that as  regards the higher stages of the mystery he can have no personal  experience, but speaks of it only as a close observer left to his own  surmises--and no more.  He may, therefore, boldly state that during, and  notwithstanding, his unfortunately rather too short stay with some  adepts, he has by actual experiment and observation verified some of the  less transcendental or incipient parts of the \"Course.\"  And, though it  will be impossible for him to give positive testimony as to what lies  beyond, he may yet mention that all his own course of study, training  and experience, long, severe and dangerous as it has often been, leads  him to the conviction that everything is really as stated, save some  details purposely veiled.  For causes which cannot be explained to the  public, he himself may he unable or unwilling to use the secret he has  gained access to.  Still he is permitted by one to whom all his  reverential affection and gratitude are due--his last guru--to divulge  for the benefit of Science and Man, and specially for the good of those  who are courageous enough to personally make the experiment, the  following astounding particulars of the occult methods for prolonging  life to a period far beyond the common.--G.M.]    ---------  * A. Chela is the pupil and disciple of an initiated Guru or  Master.--Ed.  ---------      Probably one of the first considerations which move the worldly-minded  at present to solicit initiation into Theosophy is the belief, or hope,  that, immediately on joining, some extraordinary advantage over the rest  of mankind will be conferred upon the candidate.  Some even think that  the ultimate result of their initiation will perhaps be exemption from  that dissolution which is called the common lot of mankind.  The  traditions of the \"Elixir of Life,\" said to be in the possession of  Kabalists and Alchemists, are still cherished by students of Medieval  Occultism--in Europe.  The allegory of the Ab-e Hyat or Water of Life,  is still credited as a fact by the degraded remnants of the Asiatic  esoteric sects ignorant of the real GREAT SECRET. The \"pungent and fiery  Essence,\" by which Zanoni renewed his existence, still fires the  imagination of modern visionaries as a possible scientific discovery of  the future.    Theosophically, though the fact is distinctly declared to be true, the  above-named conceptions of the mode of procedure leading to the  realization of the fact, are known to be false. The reader may or may  not believe it;  but as a matter of fact, Theosophical Occultists claim  to have communication with (living) Intelligences possessing an  infinitely wider range of observation than is contemplated even by the  loftiest aspirations of modern science, all the present \"Adepts\" of  Europe and America--dabblers in the Kabala--notwithstanding.  But far  even as those superior Intelligences have investigated (or, if  preferred, are alleged to have investigated), and remotely as they may  have searched by the help of inference and analogy, even They have  failed to discover in the Infinity anything permanent but--SPACE.  ALL  IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  Reflection, therefore, will easily suggest to the  reader the further logical inference that in a Universe which is  essentially impermanent in its conditions, nothing can confer  permanency.  Therefore, no possible substance, even if drawn from the  depths of Infinity;  no imaginable combination of drugs, whether of our  earth or any other, though compounded by even the Highest Intelligence;  no system of life or discipline though directed by the sternest  determination and skill, could possibly produce Immutability.  For in  the universe of solar systems, wherever and however investigated,  Immutability necessitates \"Non-Being\" in the physical sense given it by  the Theists-Non-Being which is nothing in the narrow conceptions of  Western Religionists--a reductio ad absurdum.  This is a gratuitous  insult even when applied to the pseudo-Christian or ecclesiastical  Jehovite idea of God.    Consequently, it will be seen that the common ideal conception of  \"Immortality\" is not only essentially wrong, but a physical and  metaphysical impossibility. The idea, whether cherished by Theosophists  or non-Theosophists, by Christians or Spiritualists, by Materialists or  Idealists, is a chimerical illusion.  But the actual prolongation of  human life is possible for a time so long as to appear miraculous and  incredible to those who regard our span of existence as necessarily  limited to at most a couple of hundred years.  We may break, as it were,  the shock of Death, and instead of dying, change a sudden plunge into  darkness to a transition into a brighter light.  And this may be made so  gradual that the passage from one state of existence to another shall  have its friction minimized, so as to be practically imperceptible.  This is a very different matter, and quite within the reach of Occult  Science.  In this, as in all other cases, means properly directed will  gain their ends, and causes produce effects. Of course, the only  question is, what are these causes, and how, in their turn, are they to  be produced.  To lift, as far as may be allowed, the veil from this  aspect of Occultism, is the object of the present paper.    We must premise by reminding the reader of two Theosophic doctrines,  constantly inculcated in \"Isis\" and in other mystic works--namely, (a)  that ultimately the Kosmos is One--one under infinite variations and  manifestations, and (b) that the so-called man is a \"compound being\"--  composite not only in the exoteric scientific sense of being a congeries  of living so-called material Units, but also in the esoteric sense of  being a succession of seven forms or parts of itself, interblended with  each other.  To put it more clearly we might say that the more ethereal  forms are but duplicates of the same aspect,--each finer one lying  within the inter-atomic spaces of the next grosser.  We would have the  reader understand that these are no subtleties, no \"spiritualities\" at  all in the Christo-Spiritualistic sense.  In the actual man reflected in  your mirror are really several men, or several parts of one composite  man;  each the exact counterpart of the other, but the \"atomic  conditions\" (for want of a better word) of each of which are so arranged  that its atoms interpenetrate those of the next \"grosser\" form.  It does  not, for our present purpose, matter how the Theosophists,  Spiritualists, Buddhists, Kabalists, or Vedantists, count, separate,  classify, arrange or name these, as that war of terms may be postponed  to another occasion.  Neither does it matter what relation each of these  men has to the various \"elements\" of the Kosmos of which he forms a  part. This knowledge, though of vital importance in other respects, need  not be explained or discussed now.  Nor does it much more concern us  that the Scientists deny the existence of such an arrangement, because  their instruments are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

MARTIN WOOD    With Forty-One Illustrations    London Chatto & Windus    1913                [Illustration:    George du Maurier    From a portrait in water-colour by himself.    In the possession of the Artist's widow.]          PREFACE      Du Maurier worked for periodicals which buried in a back number each  phase of his work as it came to an end. Thus it is that he is,  unfortunately, chiefly now remembered by the last--the most accessible,  but not by any means the finest--period of his work.    The present book is an attempt to correct this and to bring forward du  Maurier's name again in the light of his earlier achievement.    No book on the artist, however, would be complete which omitted all  reference to his literary attainment; nor would it be in order in an  essay of this extent not to seek to demonstrate that connection which  always exists between the life and the work of an artist of distinctive  temperament. The author has endeavoured, in the chapter devoted to  outlining the main incidents of du Maurier's career, to regard the  feeling of his representatives that the autobiography of the novels is  itself so complete and sensitive as scarcely to call at present for  anything supplemental. He wishes to acknowledge the kindness of the  artist's family in lending him portraits, sketch-books, and manuscript  with the permission for reproduction; also of Mr. W. Lawrence Bradbury,  so zealous a guardian of all that redounds to the fame of his great  journal, for every kind of assistance; and of Sir Francis Burnand, du  Maurier's Editor and comrade, for letters assisting him to form an  impression of du Maurier in the flesh. Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. have  also been generous in allowing the reproduction of the four drawings  included here, which appeared originally in the _Cornhill Magazine_. The  author only wishes that he felt that what he has written more justified  this consideration from everyone who was approached in connection with  his undertaking.          CONTENTS        I.

Many of the Victorians, including the Queen, and Alfred Lord Tennyson,  seem to have viewed life from the drawing-room window. They gazed  straight across the room from the English hearthrug as from undoubtedly  the greatest place on earth. They were probably right. But some of this  confidence has gone. Actually in these days there are people who won't  own up to having a drawing-room at all. If they have a room that could  possibly answer to such a description, they go out of their way to call  it the library, though its only available printed matter is a Bradshaw;  or the music-room, though the only music ever heard in it is when the  piano is dusted.    In turning over the old volumes of _Punch_ it is surprising how many of  the points made by du Maurier in his drawings and in the legends beneath  them still hold good. As a mere \"joker\" he was perhaps the least able of  the _Punch_ staff. His influence began when he started inventing  imaginary conversations. In many cases these do not represent the  discussion of topical subjects at all, but deal with social aberrations,  dated only in the illustration by the costume of the time.    In these imaginary conversations he is already a novelist. They record  the strokes of finesse and the subterfuges necessary to the attainment  of the vain ambitions which are the preoccupation of human genius in  superficial levels of Society in all ages. We realise the waste of  energy and diplomacy expended to score small points in the social game.  His art is a mirror to weed-like qualities of human nature which enjoy a  spring-time with every generation. But it also provides a remarkable  record of the effect of the sudden replacement of old by new ideals in  the world which it depicted.    The rise of the merchant capitalist upon the results of industrial  enterprises rendered possible through the invention and rapid perfecting  of machinery, created a class who suddenly appeared in the drawing-rooms  of the aristocrats as strangers. Du Maurier himself seems to join in the  amazement at their intrusion. Much of this first surprise is the theme  of his art. Before the death of the artist the newcomers had proved  their right to be there, having shamed an Aristocracy, which had lost  nearly all its natural occupations, by bringing home to it the fact that  the day was over for despising men who traded instead of fighting, who  achieved through barter what the brave would once have been too proud to  take except by conquest. The business of the original division of human  possessions by the sanguinary method was well over; it was now the  merchant's day. It was plain that trade could no longer be despised,  when, literally in an age of peace and inventive commerce, indolence was  the only alternative to engagement in it.    Du Maurier was very tolerant to social intruders when they were pretty.  He rather entered into Mrs. de Tomkyns' aims, and showed it by making  her pretty. Her ends might not be the highest, but the tact and the  subtlety displayed in her campaign were aristocratic in character, and  he would not have her laughed at personally, though we may laugh at the  topsy-turvy of a Society in which the entrance into a certain  drawing-room becomes the fun reward for the perseverance of a lifetime.  But du Maurier shuddered when behind this lady, distinguished in the  fact of the possession of genius, he saw a multitude of the aspirateless  at the door. We never lose upon the face, which showed as his through  his art, the expression of well-bred resentment, yet certainly of  amusement also.    During the period of du Maurier's work for _Punch_ the actor gets his  position in Society; and we see desolate gentlemen in other professions  drifting about at the back of the room like ships that drag their  anchor, while all the feminine blandishment of the place is concentrated  on the actor. By following up his drawings we can see the whole surface  of Victorian Society change in character; we can see one outrageous  innovation after another solidify into what was correct.    There never was a period like the Victorian; in many respects the  precedents of all older periods of Society fail to apply. In it the  aristocrats believed in democracy, and resented the democrat who was  practically their own creation. While the democrat held no faith with  the same fervour as his belief that \"whatsoever is lovely and of good  report\" could only be obtained by mingling with the upper classes. It  was the commercial glory of the great Industrial Reign that turned the  whole character of London Society upside down in du Maurier's time. It  became the study of the Suburbs to model themselves on Mayfair, to  imitate its \"rages\" and \"crazes\" in every shade. It is all the vanities  of this emulation which du Maurier records; there is little in his art  to betray the great influences Ecclesiastically, scientifically, and  politically, which expressed the genius of the Victorians. His splendid  Bishops are as tranquil as if the controversial Newman, and Gladstone  with his Disestablishment programme, had never disturbed the air. And  one fancies that politics must have bored him, so studiously does he  through over thirty years avoid even a slanting glance at the events  which preoccupied Mr. Punch in his cartoons. There is evidence that  there was more than the policy of the Paper in this. Du Maurier was an  optimist. An optimist is a man who thinks that everything is going right  when it is going wrong. It requires an effort of the imagination to  recall and picture the fact that in the first hour of Du Maurier's mere  amusement Ruskin was adding his lachrymation to Carlyle's over a society  going swiftly to Gehenna. It is the entire"]]]
