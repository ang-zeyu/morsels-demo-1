A WOMAN'S JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD, from Vienna to Brazil, Chili,  Tahiti, China, Hindostan, Persia, and Asia Minor.        BY IDA PFEIFFER.    An unabridged translation from the German.        PREFACE.        I have been called, in many of the public journals, a \"professed  tourist;\" but I am sorry to say that I have no title to the  appellation in its usual sense.  On the one hand I possess too  little wit and humour to render my writings amusing; and, on the  other, too little knowledge to judge rightly of what I have gone  through.  The only gift to which I can lay claim is that of  narrating in a simple manner the different scenes in which I have  played a part, and the different objects I have beheld; if I ever  pronounce an opinion, I do so merely on my own personal experience.    Many will perhaps believe that I undertook so long a journey from  vanity.  I can only say in answer to this--whoever thinks so should  make such a trip himself, in order to gain the conviction, that  nothing but a natural wish for travel, a boundless desire of  acquiring knowledge, could ever enable a person to overcome the  hardships, privations, and dangers to which I have been exposed.    In exactly the same manner as the artist feels an invincible desire  to paint, and the poet to give free course to his thoughts, so was I  hurried away with an unconquerable wish to see the world.  In my  youth I dreamed of travelling--in my old age I find amusement in  reflecting on what I have beheld.    The public received very favourably my plain unvarnished account of  \"A Voyage to the Holy Land, and to Iceland and Scandinavia.\"  Emboldened by their kindness, I once more step forward with the  journal of my last and most considerable voyage, and I shall feel  content if the narration of my adventures procures for my readers  only a portion of the immense fund of pleasure derived from the  voyage by                                             THE AUTHORESS.    Vienna, March 16, 1850.        With the hope that we may forward the views of the authoress, and be  the means of exciting the public attention to her position and  wants, we append the following statement by Mr. A. Petermann, which  appeared in the Athenaeum of the 6th of December, 1851:    \"Madame Pfeiffer came to London last April, with the intention of  undertaking a fresh journey; her love of travelling appearing not  only unabated, but even augmented by the success of her journey  round the world.  She had planned, as her fourth undertaking, a  journey to some of those portions of the globe which she had not yet  visited--namely, Australia and the islands of the Asiatic  Archipelago; intending to proceed thither by the usual route round  the Cape.  Her purpose was, however, changed while in London.  The  recently discovered Lake Ngami, in Southern Africa, and the  interesting region to the north, towards the equator--the reflection  how successfully she had travelled among savage tribes, where armed  men hesitated to penetrate, how well she had borne alike the cold of  Iceland and the heat of Babylonia--and lastly, the suggestion that  she might be destined to raise the veil from some of the totally  unknown portions of the interior of Africa--made her determine on  stopping at the Cape, and trying to proceed thence, if possible,  northwards into the equatorial regions of the African Continent.    \"Madame Pfeiffer left for the Cape, on the 22nd of May last, in a  sailing vessel--her usual mode of travelling by sea, steamboats  being too expensive.  She arrived safely at Cape Town on the 11th of  August, as I learned from a letter which I received from her last  week, dated the 20th of August.  From that letter the following are  extracts:--    \"'The impression which this place (Cape Town) made on me, was not an  agreeable one.  The mountains surrounding the town are bare, the  town itself (London being still fresh in my recollection) resembles  a village.  The houses are of only one story, with terraces instead  of roofs.  From the deck of the vessel a single tree was visible,  standing on a hill.  In short, on my arrival I was at once much  disappointed, and this disappointment rather increases than  otherwise.  In the town the European mode of living is entirely  prevalent--more so than in any other place abroad that I have seen.  I have made a good many inquiries as to travelling into the  interior; and have been, throughout, assured that the natives are  everywhere kindly disposed to travellers, and that as a woman I  should be able to penetrate much farther than a man,--and I have  been strongly advised to undertake a journey as far as the unknown  lakes, and even beyond.  Still, with all these splendid prospects  and hopes, I fear I shall travel less in this country than in any  other.  Here, the first thing you are told is, that you must  purchase waggons, oxen, horses, asses,--hire expensive guides, etc.,  etc.  How far should I reach in this way with my 100 pounds  sterling?  I will give you an example of the charges in this  country:--for the carriage of my little luggage to my lodgings I had  to pay 10s. 6d.!  I had previously landed in what I thought the most  expensive places in the world--London, Calcutta, Canton, etc.--had  everywhere a much greater distance to go from the vessel to my  lodgings, and nowhere had I paid half of what they charged me here.  Board and lodging I have also found very dear.  Fortunately, I have  been very kindly received into the house of Mr. Thaewitzer, the  Hamburgh consul, where I live, very agreeably, but do not much  advance the object which brought me here.  I shall, in the course of  the month, undertake a short journey with some Dutch boers to Klein  Williams; and I fear that this will form the beginning and the end  of my travels in this country.'    \"From these extracts it will be seen that the resolute lady has at  her command but very slender means for the performance of her  journeys.  The sum of 100 pounds, which was granted to her by the  Austrian government, forms the whole of her funds.  Private  resources she has none.  It took her twenty years to save enough  money to perform her first journey!--namely, that to the Holy Land.  While in London, she received scarcely any encouragement; and her  works were not appreciated by the public, or indeed known, till she  had left this country.  It is to be regretted that the want of a  little pecuniary assistance should deter the enterprising lady from  carrying out her projected journey in Southern Africa.  Though not a  scientific traveller, she is a faithful recorder of what she sees  and hears; and she is prepared to note the bearings and distances of  the journey, make meteorological observations, and keep a careful  diary--so that the results of her projected journey would perhaps be  of as much interest as those of other travellers of greater  pretensions.\"        CONTENTS.

On the first of May, 1846, I left Vienna, and, with the exception of  slight stoppages at Prague, Dresden, and Leipsic, proceeded directly  to Hamburgh, there to embark for the Brazils.  In Prague I had the  pleasure of meeting Count Berchthold, who had accompanied me during  a portion of my journey in the East.  He informed me that he should  like to be my companion in the voyage to the Brazils, and I promised  to wait for him in Hamburgh.    I had a second most interesting meeting on the steamer from Prague  to Dresden, namely, with the widow of Professor Mikan.  In the year  1817, this lady had, on the occasion of the marriage of the Austrian  Princess Leopaldine with Don Pedro I., followed her husband to the  Brazils, and afterwards made with him a scientific journey into the  interior of the country.    I had often heard this lady's name mentioned, and my joy at making  her personal acquaintance was very great.  In the kindest and most  amiable manner she communicated to me the results of her long  experience, and added advice and rules of conduct, which proved  afterwards highly useful.    I arrived in Hamburgh on the 12th of May; and, as early as the 13th,  might have embarked on board a fine fast-sailing brig, which,  besides, was christened the \"Ida,\" like myself.  With a heavy heart  I saw this fine vessel set sail.  I was obliged to remain behind, as  I had promised my travelling companion to await his arrival.

The question is, could I work there--with a lot of  unassorted people in the house?\"    \"Mabel doesn't mention any other people, Bill,\" was my sister's  rejoinder. \"I gather she's alone--as well as lonely.\"    By the way she looked sideways out of the window at nothing, it was  obvious she was disappointed, but to my surprise she did not urge the  point; and as I glanced at Mrs. Franklyn's invitation lying upon her  sloping lap, the neat, childish handwriting conjured up a mental picture  of the banker's widow, with her timid, insignificant personality, her  pale grey eyes and her expression as of a backward child. I thought,  too, of the roomy country mansion her late husband had altered to suit  his particular needs, and of my visit to it a few years ago when its  barren spaciousness suggested a wing of Kensington Museum fitted up  temporarily as a place to eat and sleep in. Comparing it mentally with  the poky Chelsea flat where I and my sister kept impecunious house, I  realized other points as well. Unworthy details flashed across me to  entice: the fine library, the organ, the quiet work-room I should have,  perfect service, the delicious cup of early tea, and hot baths at any  moment of the day--without a geyser!    \"It's a longish visit, a month--isn't it?\" I hedged, smiling at the  details that seduced me, and ashamed of my man's selfishness, yet  knowing that Frances expected it of me. \"There are points about it, I  admit. If you're set on my going with you, I could manage it all right.\"    I spoke at length in this way because my sister made no answer. I saw  her tired eyes gazing into the dreariness of Oakley Street and felt a  pang strike through me. After a pause, in which again she said no word,  I added: \"So, when you write the letter, you might hint, perhaps, that I  usually work all the morning, and--er--am not a very lively visitor!  Then she'll understand, you see.\" And I half-rose to return to my  diminutive study, where I was slaving, just then, at an absorbing  article on Comparative Aesthetic Values in the Blind and Deaf.    But Frances did not move. She kept her grey eyes upon Oakley Street  where the evening mist from the river drew mournful perspectives into  view. It was late October. We heard the omnibuses thundering across the  bridge. The monotony of that broad, characterless street seemed more  than usually depressing. Even in June sunshine it was dead, but with  autumn its melancholy soaked into every house between King's Road and  the Embankment. It washed thought into the past, instead of inviting it  hopefully towards the future. For me, its easy width was an avenue  through which nameless slums across the river sent creeping messages of  depression, and I always regarded it as Winter's main entrance into  London--fog, slush, gloom trooped down it every November, waving their  forbidding banners till March came to rout them.    Its one claim upon my love was that the south wind swept sometimes  unobstructed up it, soft with suggestions of the sea. These lugubrious  thoughts I naturally kept to myself, though I never ceased to regret the  little flat whose cheapness had seduced us. Now, as I watched my  sister's impassive face, I realized that perhaps she, too, felt as I  felt, yet, brave woman, without betraying it.    \"And, look here, Fanny,\" I said, putting a hand upon her shoulder as I  crossed the room, \"it would be the very thing for you. You're worn out  with catering and housekeeping. Mabel is your oldest friend, besides,  and you've hardly seen her since he died--\"    \"She's been abroad for a year, Bill, and only just came back,\" my sister  interposed. \"She came back rather unexpectedly, though I never thought  she would go there to live--\" She stopped abruptly. Clearly, she was  only speaking half her mind. \"Probably,\" she went on, \"Mabel wants to  pick up old links again.\"    \"Naturally,\" I put in, \"yourself chief among them.\" The veiled reference  to the house I let pass.    It involved discussing the dead man for one thing.    \"I feel I ought to go anyhow,\" she resumed, \"and of course it would be  jollier if you came too. You'd get in such a muddle here by yourself,  and eat wrong things, and forget to air the rooms, and--oh, everything!\"  She looked up laughing. \"Only,\" she added, \"there's the British  Museum--?\"    \"But there's a big library there,\" I answered, \"and all the books of  reference I could possibly want. It was of you I was thinking. You could  take up your painting again; you always sell half of what you paint. It  would be a splendid rest too, and Sussex is a jolly country to walk in.  By all means, Fanny, I advise--\"    Our eyes met, as I stammered in my attempts to avoid expressing the  thought that hid in both our minds. My sister had a weakness for  dabbling in the various \"new\" theories of the day, and Mabel, who before  her marriage had belonged to foolish societies for investigating the  future life to the neglect of the present one, had fostered this  undesirable tendency. Her amiable, impressionable temperament was open  to every psychic wind that blew. I deplored, detested the whole  business. But even more than this I abhorred the later influence that  Mr. Franklyn had steeped his wife in, capturing her body and soul in his  somber doctrines. I had dreaded lest my sister also might be caught.    \"Now that she is alone again--\"    I stopped short. Our eyes now made pretence impossible, for the truth  had slipped out inevitably, stupidly, although unexpressed in definite  language. We laughed, turning our faces a moment to look at other things  in the room. Frances picked up a book and examined its cover as though  she had made an important discovery, while I took my case out and lit a  cigarette I did not want to smoke. We left the matter there. I went out  of the room before further explanation could cause tension.  Disagreements grow into discord from such tiny things--wrong adjectives,  or a chance inflection of the voice. Frances had a right to her views of  life as much as I had. At least, I reflected comfortably, we had  separated upon an agreement this time, recognized mutually, though not  actually stated.    And this point of meeting was, oddly enough, our way of regarding some  one who was dead.    For we had both disliked the husband with a great dislike, and during  his three years' married life had only been to the house once--for a  weekend visit; arriving late on Saturday, we had left after an early  breakfast on Monday morning. Ascribing my sister's dislike to a natural  jealousy at losing her old friend, I said merely that he displeased me.  Yet we both knew that the real emotion lay much deeper. Frances, loyal,  honorable creature, had kept silence; and beyond saying that house and  grounds--he altered one and laid out the other--distressed her as an  expression of his personality somehow ('distressed' was the word she  used), no further explanation had passed her lips.    Our dislike of his personality was easily accounted for--up to a point,  since both of us shared the artist's point of view that a creed, cut to  measure and carefully dried, was an ugly thing, and that a dogma to  which believers must subscribe or perish everlastingly was a barbarism  resting upon cruelty. But while my own dislike was purely due to an  abstract worship of Beauty, my sister's had another twist in it, for  with her \"new\" tendencies, she believed that all religions were an  aspect of truth and that no one, even the lowest wretch, could escape  \"heaven\" in the long run.    Samuel Franklyn, the rich banker, was a man universally respected and  admired, and the marriage, though Mabel was fifteen years his junior,  won general applause; his bride was an heiress in her own right--  breweries--and the story of her conversion at a revivalist meeting where  Samuel Franklyn had spoken fervidly of heaven, and terrifyingly of sin,  hell and damnation, even contained a touch of genuine romance. She was a  brand snatched from the burning; his detailed eloquence had frightened  her into heaven; salvation came in the nick of time; his words had  plucked her from the edge of that lake of fire and brimstone where their  worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. She regarded him as a hero,  sighed her relief upon his saintly shoulder, and accepted the peace he  offered her with a grateful resignation.    For her husband was a \"religious man\" who successfully combined great  riches with the glamour of winning souls. He was a portly figure, though  tall, with masterful, big hands, his fingers rather thick and red; and  his dignity, that just escaped being pompous, held in it something that  was implacable. A convinced assurance, almost remorseless, gleamed in  his eyes when he preached especially, and his threats of hell fire must  have scared souls stronger than the timid, receptive Mabel whom he  married. He clad himself in long frock-coats hat buttoned unevenly, big  square boots, and trousers that invariably bagged at the knee and were a  little short; he wore low collars, spats occasionally, and a tall black  hat that was not of silk. His voice was alternately hard and unctuous;  and he regarded theaters, ballrooms, and racecourses as the vestibule of  that brimstone lake of whose geography he was as positive as of his  great banking offices in the City. A philanthropist up to the hilt,  however, no one ever doubted his complete sincerity; his convictions  were ingrained, his faith borne out by his life--as witness his name  upon so many admirable Societies, as treasurer, patron, or heading the  donation list. He bulked large in the world of doing good, a broad and "]]]
