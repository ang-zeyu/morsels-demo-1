Not one useless or superfluous sentence is written. Every word is full  of meaning. They are highly condensed. Think deeply over them.    2. They are meant as a practical supplement to the 'Spiritual  Consciousness,' 'Soul-Force' and 'Inner Forces.' Studied side by side,  these lessons will yield a great deal of benefit. You are expected to  think hard and long.    3. Let none expect speedy or miraculous results. _All spiritual training  calls for infinite patience and deep reverence unto the Guru. Constant  rise and fall accompanies all progress_.          FOREWORD.    CONCENTRATION AND THOUGHT-CONTROL.      Student! Your life is your own. You have only yourself to thank for what  you are, have been and will be. Take your present into your own hand.  Consciously shape out of it your future. Direct your forces along lines  of study and endeavour that have the strongest attraction for you. Such  attraction is the indication of need. It is the hand pointing out your  Life-purpose. What your heart desires earnestly and clamours for  incessantly is _attracted_ to you out of the _invisible supply, i.e._,  the means, the environments, the right sort of persons, books and  thought-forces are drawn to you and then you are expected to work out  your desire. This is in perfect accord with the great _Law of  Attraction_. Some call it God: since it answers all sincere prayers.  Prayer, remember, is the sincere desire of the heart. I take it that you  hunger for Truth and Spiritual Growth--else you and I would not be here.  The instructions given you hereunder are meant to give you a strong body  and a strong will. They will also tend to your Soul-Unfoldment. Talk not  of them. Keep your mouth closed. Be serious, earnest and thoughtful. Then  work at them confidently and with perseverance. Do not be daunted by  apparent failures. Failure is the stepping-stone to Success. He fails who  gives up a thing in final despair. Go on, I say. You will improve from  the very first day, and in a short time you will be another man. All the  leaders of humanity, past or present, have studied and investigated with  tireless zeal along the special lines and, in Spiritual culture, you must  do the same. But you must have health, a strong will and a steady brain,  and I will enable you to have these positively. Keep these instructions  strictly privately. Master them by constant meditation upon same.          LESSON I.    CONCENTRATION.      Concentration signifies the state of being at a centre (_con_ and  _centrum_). Applied to thought, it is the act of bringing the mind to a  single point. Each human being must practise concentration _subjectively_  and _objectively_. In other words, each human being aims with more or  less precision at concentration on a point _within_ and a point _without_  his own world. Concentration \"without\" is illustrated when you devote all  your attention upon Nature, such as learning a trade, a profession, a  science, an art or some form of business. This is _Evolution_, outgoing  or positive mental energy. I shall call this _Objective Concentration_.  Concentration \"within\" implies the withdrawing of attention from the  external world and the placing of mind on \"God,\" \"Spirit,\" \"Heaven,\"  \"Religion,\" \"Peace,\" \"Nirvana,\" \"Eternity,\" etc. This is _Involution_,  _i.e._, incoming or negative energy.    When _Objective Concentration_ alone is practised, you develop into a  hard-headed, practical man of the world or a successful man of business.  You are keen and shrewd. The world is a very matter-of-fact thing to  you. You cannot think of anything else beyond money-making and pleasures  and worldly affairs. You are a \"worldling of the world,\" very clever,  rich, and a master along your own lines. But spiritually you are an  imbecile, worse than a baby. This is the _Objective Mind_--the \"deepest  immersed in matter, literally made of the dust.\" \"It is the brain of  worldly wisdom, common sense, prudence, methodical arrangement, order,  discipline, classification, the skill and knowledge of the expert in any  branch or department of art or science.\" This side of the mind is well  developed in Scientists, Mathematicians and Businessmen, etc. Where  it is not guided by the Subjective Mind, it can only see diversity and  difference and is the slave of Maya--the slayer of the Real.    _Subjective Concentration_ is seeking the Kingdom of Heaven _within_  you. \"God is Spirit and they that worship Him must worship in Spirit  and Truth.\" LAPLACE, the great astronomer, asserted that he had swept  the heavens with his telescope and found neither God nor Heaven. Yes,  poor LAPLACE! He looked for God objectively instead of subjectively.    The Kingdom of God comes not with 'observation' but it is 'within' you.  The be-all and the end-all of religion is the practice of Subjective  Concentration. The performance of objective work by the human organism  necessitates expenditure of energy and at last death, because all  Objective Concentration means 'going from' the Absolute centre--God--and  hence it expends Spiritual Energy. Subjective Concentration means 'coming  to' the centre and hence it husbands and recuperates this energy. Now  nature is motion to and from, and Spirit--the centre of Life. This  two-fold motion constitutes what is known as polarity--Evolution and  Involution--negative and positive. At the negative pole life becomes  involved, _i.e._, 'wrapped up' in form. At the positive pole life  'evolves' or becomes expressed in nature. In Subjective Concentration you  return for fresh supplies to the inexhaustible storehouse of force--the  Absolute Will. Jesus healed the sick, exhibited control over external  nature by raising the dead, because his chaste soul could receive nothing  negatively from God and could give it out positively to the objective  world. All power comes from God. I would impress upon you the  all-important necessity of placing yourself in a magnetically passive  attitude towards the Universal Will and then of taking up a calm,  positive attitude towards the phenomenal world--which is a projection of  the lower nature and hence must be handled masterfully, fearlessly and  confidently. Be positive to the external world. Be negative and receptive  to the Lord's Will-force. Remember this. This brings me to the supremest  and most solid truth contained in the Science of prayer. The praying  mind, by its mere attitude of faith and earnest expectation, opens itself  out to the tremendous inflow of Divine Energy. It draws close to the  centre of all-power, wisdom and love, and drinks deep of the living  waters of life so that even the very face or flesh begins to shine under  the influence of this self-polarization--if I may be permitted to use  this word--through prayer. Here is the _causa nuxus_ between a prayer and  its sure reply. Do you remember what Lord Rosebery said of the great  Puritan Mystic Oliver Cromwell? If not, please let me quote: \"The secret  of his extraordinary success--he was a practical mystic--the most  formidable and terrible of all combinations. The man who combines  inspiration, apparently derived--in my judgment, really derived--from  close communion with the Supernatural and the Celestial, a man who has  that inspiration and adds to it the energy of a mighty man of action,  such a man as that lives in communion on a _Sinai_ of his own; and when  he pleases to come down to this world below, seems armed with no less  than the terrors and decrees of the Almighty Himself.\" Now both forms of  concentration must be practised so as to hold the two poles in the even  balance of harmonious growth.    You will perform the daily work to which you are naturally adapted in the  common weal (Objective Concentration) and after the daily task is  finished, retire to the bosom of the Universal Spirit by the regular  practice of Subjective Concentration.    Now will you realise the ideal of peace in the very midst of the toil  and sweat of the day.    The foregoing diagram, if closely and thoughtfully studied, will show the  stages the mind has to 'grow into' in objective and subjective  concentration.    In order to acquire knowledge of the laws of external nature the mirror  you require is accurate observation and you must focus your attention and  push objective concentration to its final stage of perfect knowledge or  illumination in order to master any special branch of science.    In Objective Concentration, _Pratyahara_ and _Dharana_ are the  preparatory stages. Take a scientist, for instance. He knows that when  the mind is engaged with several things, mind force is scattered. He  cannot be a politician, a musician, etc., and at the same time an expert  scientist. He gradually abstracts his attention from all other subjects  and pauses it on one subject or one set of subjects.    _Pratyahara_ is the continued effort of the mind to so abstract itself.    _Dharana_ is reached when this effort is finally successful and the  mind becomes steadfast and one-pointed. _Dhyana_ is an extension of  this steadfastness. When _Dhyana_ is reached, the student is beyond the  range of books. His mind is occupied with original researches and  experiments and his knowledge becomes more and more definite. Going on  and on always on the one line complete knowledge of that subject is  attained. This is the objective view of _Samadhi_.

In this  dilemma, I was obliged to adopt the alternative of so condensing the  matter as to bring the whole within the prescribed proportions.    But this operation necessarily diminished the general interest of the  subjects treated, as well by the omission of incidents which would  otherwise have been retained, as by the exclusion of anecdotes  calculated to illustrate the habits and instincts of the animals  described.    [Footnote 1: _Ceylon: An Account of the Island, Physical, Historical,  and Typographical; with Notices of its Natural History, Antiquities, and  Productions._ By Sir JAMES EMERSON TENNENT, K.C.S., LL.D., &c.  Illustrated by Maps. Plans, and Drawings. 2 vols. 8vo. Longman and Co.,  1859.]    A suggestion to re-publish these sections in an independent form has  afforded an opportunity for repairing some of these defects by revising  the entire, restoring omitted passages, and introducing fresh materials  collected in Ceylon; the additional matter occupying a very large  portion of the present volume.    I have been enabled, at the same time, to avail myself of the  corrections and communications of scientific friends; and thus to  compensate, in some degree for what is still incomplete, by increased  accuracy in minute particulars.    In the Introduction to the First Edition of the original work I alluded,  in the following terms, to that portion of it which is now reproduced in  an extended form:--    \"Regarding the _fauna_ of Ceylon, little has been published in any  collective form, with the exception of a volume by Dr. KELAART entitled  _Prodromus Faunae Zeilanicae_; several valuable papers by Mr. EDGAR L.  LAYARD in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ for 1852 and  1853; and some very imperfect lists appended to PRIDHAM'S compiled  account of the island.[1] KNOX, in the charming narrative of his  captivity, published in the feign of Charles II., has devoted a chapter  to the animals of Ceylon, and Dr. DAVY has described some of the  reptiles: but with these exceptions the subject is almost untouched in  works relating to the colony. Yet a more than ordinary interest attaches  to the inquiry, since Ceylon, instead of presenting, as is generally  assumed, an identity between its _fauna_ and that of Southern India,  exhibits a remarkable diversity, taken in connection with the limited  area over which the animals included in it are distributed. The island,  in fact, may be regarded as the centre of a geographical circle,  possessing within itself forms, whose allied species radiate far into  the temperate regions of the north, as well as in to Africa, Australia,  and the isles of the Eastern Archipelago.    [Footnote 1: _An Historical, Political, and Statistical Account of  Ceylon and its Dependencies_, by C. PRIDHAM, Esq. 2 vols. 8vo., London,  1849.]    \"In the chapters that I have devoted to its elucidation, I have  endeavoured to interest others in the subject, by describing my own  observations and impressions, with fidelity, and with as much accuracy  as may be expected from a person possessing, as I do, no greater  knowledge of zoology and the other physical sciences than is ordinarily  possessed by any educated gentleman. It was my good fortune, however, in  my journeys to have the companionship of friends familiar with many  branches of natural science: the late Dr. GARDNER, Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD,  an accomplished zoologist, Dr. TEMPLETON, and others; and I was thus  enabled to collect on the spot many interesting facts relative to the  structure and habits of the numerous tribes. These, chastened by the  corrections of my fellow-travellers, and established by the examination  of collections made in the colony, and by subsequent comparison with  specimens contained in museums at home, I have ventured to submit as  faithful outlines of the _fauna_ of Ceylon.    \"The sections descriptive of the several classes are accompanied by  lists, prepared with the assistance of scientific friends, showing the  extent to which each particular branch had been investigated by  naturalists, up to the period of my departure from Ceylon at the close  of 1849. These, besides their inherent interest, will, I trust,  stimulate others to engage in the same pursuit, by exhibiting chasms,  which it remains for future industry and research to fill up;--and the  study of the zoology of Ceylon may thus serve as a preparative for that  of Continental India, embracing, as the former does, much that is common  to both, as well as possessing a _fauna_ peculiar to the island, that in  itself will amply repay more extended scrutiny.    \"From these lists have been excluded all species regarding the  authenticity of which reasonable doubts could be entertained[1], and of  some of them, a very few have been printed in _italics_, in order to  denote the desirability of more minute comparison with well-determined  specimens in the great national depositories before finally  incorporating them with the Singhalese catalogues.    [Footnote 1: An exception occurs in the list of shells, prepared by Mr.  SYLVANUS HANLEY, in which some whose localities are doubtful have been  admitted for reasons adduced. (See p. 387.)]    \"In the labour of collecting and verifying the facts embodied in these  sections, I cannot too warmly express my thanks for the aid I have  received from gentlemen interested in similar studies in Ceylon: from  Dr. KELAART[1] and Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD, as well as from officers of the  Ceylon Civil Service; the Hon. GERALD C. TALBOT, Mr. C.R. BULLER, Mr.  MERCER, Mr. MORRIS, Mr. WHITING, Major SKINNER, and Mr. MITFORD.    [Footnote 1: It is with deep regret that I have to record the death of  this accomplished gentleman, which occurred in 1860.]    \"Before venturing to commit these chapters of my work to the press, I  have had the advantage of having portions of them read by Professor  HUXLEY, Mr. MOORE, of the East India House Museum; Mr. R. PATTERSON,  F.R.S., author of the _Introduction to Zoology_; and by Mr. ADAM WHITE,  of the British Museum; to each of whom I am exceedingly indebted for the  care they have bestowed. In an especial degree I have to acknowledge the  kindness of Dr. J.E. GRAY, F.R.S., for valuable additions and  corrections in the list of the Ceylon Reptilia; and to Professor FARADAY  for some notes on the nature and qualities of the \"Serpent Stone,\"[2]  submitted to him.    [Footnote 2: See p. 312.]    \"The extent to which my observations on _the Elephant_ have been  carried, requires some explanation. The existing notices of this noble  creature are chiefly devoted to its habits and capabilities _in  captivity_; and very few works, with which I am acquainted, contain  illustrations of its instincts and functions when wild in its native  woods. Opportunities for observing the latter, and for collecting facts  in connection with them, are abundant in Ceylon; and from the moment of  my arrival, I profited by every occasion afforded to me for observing  the elephant in a state of nature, and obtaining from hunters and  natives correct information as to its oeconomy and disposition.  Anecdotes in connection with this subject, I received from some of the  most experienced residents in the island; amongst others, from Major  SKINNER, Captain PHILIP PAYNE GALLWEY, Mr. FAIRHOLME, Mr. CRIPPS, and  Mr. MORRIS. Nor can I omit to express my acknowledgments to Professor  OWEN, of the British Museum, to whom this portion of my manuscript was  submitted previous to its committal to the press.\"    To the foregoing observations I have little to add beyond my  acknowledgment to Dr. ALBERT GUeNTHER, of the British Museum, for the  communication of important facts in illustration of the ichthyology of  Ceylon, as well as of the reptiles of the island.    Mr. BLYTH, of the Calcutta Museum, has carefully revised the Catalogue  of Birds, and supplied me with much useful information in regard to  their geographical distribution. To his experienced scrutiny is due the  perfected state in which the list is now presented. It will be seen,  however, from the italicised names still retained, that inquiry is far  from being exhausted.    Mr. THWAITES, the able Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at  Peradenia, near Kandy, has forwarded to me many valuable observations,  not only in connection with the botany, but the zoology of the mountain  region. The latter I have here embodied in their appropriate places, and  those relating to plants and vegetation will appear in a future edition  of my large work.    To M. NIETNER, of Colombo, I am likewise indebted for many particulars  regarding Singhalese Entomology, a department to which his attention has  been given, with equal earnestness and success.
