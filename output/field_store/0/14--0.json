BIBLE STORIES AND RELIGIOUS CLASSICS    WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ANSON PHELPS STOKES, JR.      _ILLUSTRATED BY_ BEATRICE STEVENS        1903          INTRODUCTION    There never was a time when the demand for books for young people was so  great as it is to-day or when so much was being done to meet the demand.  \"Children's Counter,\" \"Boys' Books,\" are signs which, especially at the  Christmas season, attract the eye in every large book shop. Tales of  adventure, manuals about various branches of nature study, historical  romances, lives of heroes--in fact, almost every kind of book--is to be  found in abundance, beautifully illustrated, attractively bound, well  printed, all designed and written especially for the youth of our land.  It is indeed an encouraging sign. It means that the child of to-day is  being introduced to the world's best in literature and science and  history and art in simple and gradual ways.    In the Middle Ages stories of the martyrs and legends of the Church,  along with some simple form of catechetical instruction, formed the  basis of a child's mental and religious training. Later, during and  after the Crusades, the stories of war and the mysteries of the East  increased the stock in trade for the homes of Europe; but still the  horizon remained a narrow one. Even the invention of printing did not  bring to the young as many direct advantages as would naturally be  expected. To-day, when Christian missionaries set up a printing press in  some distant island of the sea, the first books which they print in the  vernacular are almost invariably those parts of the Bible, such as the  Gospels and the stories of Genesis, which most appeal to the young, and,  what is of special importance, they have the young directly and mainly  in mind in their publishing work. This was not true a few centuries ago.  The presses were, perhaps naturally and inevitably, almost exclusively  occupied with books for the learned world. To be sure, the Legenda  Aurea, of which I shall speak later, although not intended primarily for  children, proved a great boon to them. So did the Chap Books of England.  But it was not until the middle of the eighteenth century, when John  Newbery set up his book shop at St. Paul's Churchyard, London, that any  special attention was given by printers to the publication, in  attractive form, of juvenile books. Newbery's children's books made him  famous in his day, but the world seems to have forgotten him. Yet he  deserves a monument along with AEsop, and La Fontaine, and Kate  Greenaway, and Andersen, and Scott and Henty, and all the other greater  and lesser lights who have done so much to gladden the heart and enlarge  the mind of childhood and youth.    But from Newbery's day to this year of our Lord nineteen hundred and  three is a very long jump in what we may call the evolution of juvenile  literature, for the preparation of reading matter for young people seems  now almost to have reached its climax. There is one field, however, and  that the one which this volume tries to cover, which strangely enough  seems to have been almost neglected. Of \"goody-goody\" Sunday School  library books of an old-fashioned type, which are insipid and lacking  both in virility of thought and literary form, there are, alas, already  too many. What we need is something to take their place, something which  will furnish real literature, and yet which from subject matter and  manner of handling is specially adapted to what I still like to call  Sunday reading, a phrase which unfortunately seems to mean little to  most people to-day. Bearing this in mind, it is the purpose of this book  to gather together, in attractive form, such religious classics as are  specially fitted to interest and uplift young people.    There is a wide variety in so far as _subject matter_, _source_ and  _form_ are concerned, but a certain unity is given to the contents of  the volume by the religious note, which, whether brought prominently  forward or not, is found alike in all the selections.    The Bible has furnished directly or indirectly most of the _subject  matter_ here used. The biographies of various Scripture characters  appear in large numbers. Adam and Noah head the list, and Peter and  Paul bring up the end of a procession of worthies whose heroic deeds as  the servants of Jehovah will always appeal to the imagination of  youthful minds. But it is not with Bible characters only that this book  deals. The lives of Christian saints who entered upon their inheritance,  such as Christopher and Sylvester and Francis of Assisi, also have their  place, while yet more prominent are stories and poems based on some  Bible incidents. Even selections such as Hawthorne's Great Stone Face or  Wordsworth's Ode to Duty have their roots deep in the Bible, for they  can be understood and explained only by those who know the Revelation it  contains. In so far, then, as the subject matter of the volume is  concerned, either it or its inspiration can always be traced back to the  Bible.    When we turn from the Bible material which, as we have seen, supplies  both subject and inspiration, to the _source_ from which the selections  in their literary form as here given are derived, we find that the old  foundations have sufficed for many kinds of structure. Probably the  source from which the editor has drawn most largely is the Golden  Legend. This work, which was translated into English and printed by  Caxton in 1483, although little heard of now, was for several centuries  a household word in Christendom. It was the creation of a Genoese  Archbishop, Jacobus de Voragine, and dates from about the middle of the  thirteenth century. The good Archbishop, using the Bible and the Lives  of the Saints as a basis, and as a sharer of the superstitions of the  time having unbounded faith in every legend of the Church, put together  in simple form for the edification of his flock the various stories  about Jewish and Christian worthies which compose the original Legenda  Aurea. This was translated into French by one Jean de Vignay in the  fourteenth century, and the English version was in turn mainly made from  this translation. In the simple, sturdy language of Caxton the book  became a most popular one, being often read aloud in the Parish Churches  of England, where it helped to familiarize the people, especially the  young, with sacred story as represented by the heroes of the Old  Testament and the saints of the Church. In Caxton's introduction there  is a quaint sentence regarding the name of the book. After mentioning  the Latin title, he adds \"that is to say in Englyshe the golden legende  for lyke as passeth golde in vallwe al other metallys, soo thys legende  exedeth all other bokes.\" Whether the good printer's judgment be  justified or no, it is not for us to say. It is true, however, that  after the passing of over six centuries since its original production,  the editor of this volume in looking for religious classics for young  people has made more use of it than of any other collection. All honor,  then, to the old Archbishop of Genoa and to William Caxton, who made  his work accessible to the youth of England.    The only other work which deserves any special mention as a source for  the contents of this volume, is the Stories and Tales of Hans Christian  Andersen. If ever there was any one who deserved the title of the  Children's Friend, surely this son of a poor Danish shoemaker is the  man. His Tales have been translated into many languages, and because of  their true imagination and their simplicity of expression they have  appealed to all children. Ten or more of them appear in this volume.  They are charming and wholesome reading, and their continued popularity  makes us realize the truth of these closing lines in Andersen's The Old  Grave Stones: \"The good and the beautiful perish never; they live  eternally in tale and song.\"    The other sources from which this collection has been made up are so  varied as to require no mention aside from that given with each title.  The Master Poets of English Literature have been freely drawn upon:  Byron to tell of the Destruction of Sennacherib, Milton to sing of  Christ's Nativity, Wordsworth to meditate aloud on Duty, and other great  writers to emphasize various deep truths of life.           *       *       *       *       *    As we turn from subject matter and source to _form_, we again find great  variety. Almost every kind of literature is represented. The early  lengends of the Jewish people, told by the author of the Legenda Aurea  almost in the words of Scripture, bring to young and old alike the same  lessons about God and Duty. The fact that they are legends, rather than  exact history, does not in any way lessen their religious value. Then,  too, the book contains allegories, such as that of the Pilgrim's  Progress, Christendom's greatest religious classic next to the Bible  itself, and those of some of Andersen's Tales. Poetry also is well  represented, the selections being in large part suggested by Scripture.  There are in addition many stories in the ordinary sense of the  word--tales which are entirely the fabric of the imagination, but which,  like the selections from Hawthorne, have some great lesson to teach. In  fact, the literary forms represented in this volume are almost as  numerous as those of the Bible itself. The latter used to be looked upon  merely as a storehouse of historic facts and devotional songs; now we  see in it Legend, Oratory, Poetry, Allegory, History, Proverb and  Prophecy; and we find that all of these forms are used by God's servants  to teach His truth to men.           *       *       *       *       *    Sufficient has been said, I think, to show the purpose and scope of this  volume and to introduce the reader to its contents. It is my hope and  belief that the effort of my friend, Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],[0,"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#1)"],[1,"TRAVELS AND RESEARCHES IN SOUTH AFRICA.    Also called, Travels and Researches in South Africa;    or, Journeys and Researches in South Africa.    By David Livingstone    [British (Scot) Missionary and Explorer--1813-1873.]           [NOTE by the Project Gutenberg Contributor of this file:       This etext was prepared by Alan. R. Light To assure a high quality text,     the original was typed in (manually) twice and electronically compared.     Italicized words or phrases are CAPITALIZED.       David Livingstone was born in Scotland, received his medical degree from     the University of Glasgow, and was sent to South Africa by the London     Missionary Society. Circumstances led him to try to meet the material     needs as well as the spiritual needs of the people he went to, and while     promoting trade and trying to end slavery, he became the first European     to cross the continent of Africa, which story is related in this book.     Two appendixes have been added to this etext, one of which is simply     notes on the minor changes made to make this etext more readable, (old     vs. new forms of words, names, etc.); the other is a review from the     February, 1858 edition of Harper's Magazine, which is included both for     those readers who want to see a brief synopsis, and more importantly to     give an example of how Livingstone's accomplishments were seen in     his own time. The unnamed reviewer was by no means as enlightened as     Livingstone, yet he was not entirely in the dark, either.       The casual reader, who may not be familiar with the historical period,     should note that a few things that Livingstone wrote, which might be     seen as racist by today's standards, was not considered so in his     own time. Livingstone simply uses the terms and the science of his     day--these were no doubt flawed, as is also seen elsewhere, in his     references to malaria, for example. Which all goes to show that it was     the science of the day which was flawed, and not so much Livingstone.       I will also add that the Rev. Livingstone has a fine sense of humour,     which I hope the reader will enjoy. His description of a Makololo dance     is classic.       Lastly, I will note that what I love most about Livingstone's     descriptions is not only that he was not polluted by the racism of his     day, but that he was not polluted by the anti-racism of our own. He     states things as he sees them, and notes that the Africans are, like all     other men, a curious mixture of good and evil. This, to me, demonstrates     his good faith better than any other description could. You see, David     Livingstone does not write about Africa as a missionary, nor as an     explorer, nor yet as a scientist, but as a man meeting fellow men. I     hope you will enjoy his writings as much as I did.       Alan R.

DAVID LIVINGSTONE. London, Oct., 1857.            Preface.    When honored with a special meeting of welcome by the Royal Geographical  Society a few days after my arrival in London in December last, Sir  Roderick Murchison, the President, invited me to give the world a  narrative of my travels; and at a similar meeting of the Directors of  the London Missionary Society I publicly stated my intention of sending  a book to the press, instead of making many of those public appearances  which were urged upon me. The preparation of this narrative* has  taken much longer time than, from my inexperience in authorship, I had  anticipated.       * Several attempts having been made to impose upon the public,     as mine, spurious narratives of my travels, I beg to tender my     thanks to the editors of the 'Times' and of the 'Athenaeum'     for aiding to expose them, and to the booksellers of London     for refusing to SUBSCRIBE for any copies.    Greater smoothness of diction and a saving of time might have been  secured by the employment of a person accustomed to compilation; but my  journals having been kept for my own private purposes, no one else  could have made use of them, or have entered with intelligence into the  circumstances in which I was placed in Africa, far from any European  companion. Those who have never carried a book through the press  can form no idea of the amount of toil it involves. The process has  increased my respect for authors and authoresses a thousand-fold.    I can not refrain from referring, with sentiments of admiration  and gratitude, to my friend Thomas Maclear, Esq., the accomplished  Astronomer Royal at the Cape. I shall never cease to remember his  instructions and help with real gratitude. The intercourse I had the  privilege to enjoy at the Observatory enabled me to form an idea of the  almost infinite variety of acquirements necessary to form a true and  great astronomer, and I was led to the conviction that it will be long  before the world becomes overstocked with accomplished members of that  profession. Let them be always honored according to their deserts; and  long may Maclear, Herschel, Airy, and others live to make known the  wonders and glory of creation, and to aid in rendering the pathway of  the world safe to mariners, and the dark places of the earth open to  Christians!    I beg to offer my hearty thanks to my friend Sir Roderick Murchison,  and also to Dr. Norton Shaw, the secretary of the Royal Geographical  Society, for aiding my researches by every means in their power.    His faithful majesty Don Pedro V., having kindly sent out orders to  support my late companions until my return, relieved my mind of anxiety  on their account. But for this act of liberality, I should certainly  have been compelled to leave England in May last; and it has afforded me  the pleasure of traveling over, in imagination, every scene again,  and recalling the feelings which actuated me at the time. I have much  pleasure in acknowledging my deep obligations to the hospitality and  kindness of the Portuguese on many occasions.    I have not entered into the early labors, trials, and successes of the  missionaries who preceded me in the Bechuana country, because that has  been done by the much abler pen of my father-in-law, Rev. Robert Moffat,  of Kuruman, who has been an energetic and devoted actor in the scene for  upward of forty years. A slight sketch only is given of my own attempts,  and the chief part of the book is taken up with a detail of the efforts  made to open up a new field north of the Bechuana country to the  sympathies of Christendom. The prospects there disclosed are fairer than  I anticipated, and the capabilities of the new region lead me to hope  that by the production of the raw materials of our manufactures, African  and English interests will become more closely linked than heretofore,  that both countries will be eventually benefited, and that the cause of  freedom throughout the world will in some measure be promoted.    Dr. Hooker, of Kew, has had the kindness to name and classify for me,  as far as possible, some of the new botanical specimens which I brought  over; Dr. Andrew Smith (himself an African traveler) has aided me in  the zoology; and Captain Need has laid open for my use his portfolio  of African sketches, for all which acts of liberality my thanks are  deservedly due, as well as to my brother, who has rendered me willing  aid as an amanuensis.    Although I can not profess to be a draughtsman, I brought home with me  a few rough diagram-sketches, from one of which the view of the Falls of  the Zambesi has been prepared by a more experienced artist.
