It is an imperative duty, because it must be performed at  once, for otherwise it will be too late. Every possible means of  preservation,--sentimental, educational and legislative,--must be  employed.    The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this great  battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones,  nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of  beauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to sound a loud alarm,  to present the facts in very strong language, backed up by irrefutable  statistics and by photographs which tell no lies, to establish the law  and enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon.    This book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of the  sounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the  Middle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes,  their liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that the welfare  and happiness of our own and of all future generations of Americans are  at stake in this battle for the preservation of Nature against the  selfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her destroyers.    We no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, and  regarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state of  civilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature, whether  it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is regarded  with equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to live in when  a colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in order  that the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, and  ultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The people of all the  New England States are poorer when the ignorant whites, foreigners, or  negroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birds  of the North for a mess of pottage.    Travels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the North  American continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature being  destroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within our  conservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthly  hades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this, but  men and women who boast of their civilization. Air and water are  polluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds,  forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams. Many  birds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on the verge of  extermination. Vulgar advertisements hide the landscape, and in all  that disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day,  we Americans are in the lead.    Fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide of  conservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all other  northern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it, but  they are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and spiritual  energy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans and Canadians  who have turned their best forces of mind and language into literature  and into political power for the conservation movement, is becoming  stronger every day. Yet we are far from the point where the momentum of  conservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of  destruction; and this is especially true with regard to our fast  vanishing animal life.    The facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all those  lovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are living in a  false or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these facts is  inexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures of supposed  protection in America--under a system of free shooting--are so glaring  that we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms. The  author of this work is no amateur in the field of wild-life protection.  His ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long and  successful experience. The states which are still behind in this  movement may well give serious heed to his summons, and pass the new  laws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant.    The New York Zoological Society, which is cooperating with many other  organizations in this great movement, sends forth this work in the  belief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the great  cause or rendering more effective service in it than William T.  Hornaday. We believe that this is a great book, destined to exert a  world-wide influence, to be translated into other languages, and to  arouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life before it  is too late.    HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN,  10 December, 1912. _President of the New York Zoological Society_           *        *        *        *        *    PREFACE      The writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question, we  are exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes  _according to law!_    I am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entire  United States and Canada, in every state and province, the existing  legal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective.  There is not a single state in our country from which the killable game  is not being rapidly and persistently shot to death, legally or  illegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding, with  extermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement is not  open to argument; for millions of men know that it is literally true. We  are living in a fool's paradise.    The rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day throughout  the world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers paved the  prairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses. From one end of  our continent to the other, there is a restless, resistless desire to  \"kill, _kill!_\"    I have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all  over our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective laws  have practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that in  all save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly careful  to provide \"open seasons\" for slaughter, as long as any game remains to  kill!    _And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly and  exclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of the  People have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the three per  cent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore._    I am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do not  kill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting and  preserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us, but  chiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused, before it is  too late?    The time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding \"bag limits\"  and different \"open seasons\" as being sufficient to preserve the game,  has gone by! We have reached the point where the alternatives are _long  closed seasons or a gameless continent;_ and we must choose one or the  other, speedily.

[Illustration: Lemmon.]      _A Lemmon Sallet._    Take Lemmons, rub them upon a Grate, to make their rinds smooth, cut  them in halves, take out the meat of them, and boyle them in faire  water a good while, changing the water once or twice in the boyling,  to take away the bitternesse of them, when they are tender take them  out and scrape away all the meat (if any be left) very cleane, then  cut them as thin as you can (to make them hold) in a long string, or  in reasonable short pieces, and lay them in your glasse, and boyling  some of the best _White_-wine vineger with shugar, to a reasonable  thin Syrupe, powre it upon them into your glasse, and keep them for  your use.      _To Preserve Oranges or Lemmons_.    Take your _Oranges_ or _Lemmons_, lay them in water three dayes, and  three nights, to take away their bitternesse, then boyle them in faire  water till they be tender, make as much Syrupe for them as will make  them swim about the pan, let them not boyle too long therein, for it  will make the skins tough; then let them lie all night in the Syrupe,  to make them take the Syrupe in the morning, boyle the Syrupe to his  thicknesse, and put them in gally pots or glasses, to keep all the  yeare, and this is the best way to Preserve _Orenges, Lemmons_, or  _Citrons_.      _To make Past of Lemmons_.    Take halfe a dozen of thick-rined _Lemmons_, cut them through the  middest, and boyle them tender in faire water, then stamp them in a  Morter, strayne the juyce or pulp from them, and dry it, and put two  pound of _Shugar_ to it, then make it into what fashion you will, on a  sheet of white paper, dry it in an Oven, and turne it often for two  dayes and two nights, for in that time it will be dry enough; box it  thus up, and it will endure all the Yeare.      _Sweet Bagges to lay amongst Linnen_.    Take _Orris, Cypris, Calamus, Fusis_, all of them grosse beaten, and  _Gallingall_ roots, of each a handfull, and as much of the small tops  of _Lavender_, dryed, and put them into baggs to lay among your  cloaths. You may put in a handfull or two of _Damask Rose_ leaves  dryed, which will somewhat better the sent.          Medicines made of Lemmons.      _To take away the Spots, or red Pimpels of the face_.    Take halfe a pint of raine water, and halfe a pint of good _Verjuice_,  seeth it till it be halfe consumed, then whilst it boils fill it up  againe with juyce of _Lemmon_, and so let it seeth a pretty while;  then take it from the fire, and when it is cold put to it the whites  of four new laid Eggs, well beaten, and with this water annoynt  the place often.      _A very good Medicine for the Stone_.    Make a Posset of a quart of _Rhenish_ wine, a pint of _Ale_ and a  pint of _Milke_, then take away the curd, and put into the drink,  two handfulls of Sorrell, one handfull of _Burnet_, and halfe a handfull  of _Balm_, boyle them together a good while, but not too long,  least the drink be too unpleasant, then take of the drink a quarter  of a pint, or rather halfe a pint, at once, at morning, and to bed-ward,  putting therein first two or three spoonfulls of juice of _Lemmons_,  this is an excellent Medicine for the _Stone in the Kidneyes_, to  dissolve and bring it away. It is very good in these Diseases of the  _Stone_, to use _Burnet_ often in your drink at Meales, and often to  steep it in over night, and in the morning put in three or foure  spoonfulls of juice of _Lemmons_, and to drink thereof a good  draught every morning a week together, about the full of the  Moone, three dayes before, and three dayes after.      _To roste a Shoulder of Mutton with Lemmons_.    Take a Shoulder of _Mutton_ halfe rosted, cut off most of the meat  thereof, in thin slices, into a faire dish with the gravy thereof, put  thereto about the quantity of a pint of clarret wine, with a spoonfull  or two at most of the best wine _Vineger_, season it with _Nutmeggs_,  and a little _Ginger_, then pare off the rines of one or two  good _Lemmons_, and slice them thin into the _Mutton_, when it is almost  well stewed between two dishes, and so let them stew together  two or three warmes, when they are enough, put them in a clean  dish, and take the shoulder blade being well broyled on a  grid-iron, and lay it upon your meat, garnishing your dishes  with some slices and rinds of the _Lemmons_, and so serve it.      _To Boyle A Capon with Oranges and Lemmons_.    Take _Orenges_ and _Lemmons_ peeled, and cut them the long way,  and if you can keep your cloves whole, and put them into your  best Broth of _Mutton_ or _Capon_, with _Prunes_ or _Currants_ three or  four dayes, and when they have been well sodden, cut whole _Pepper_,  great _Mase_, a great peice of _Suggar_, some _Rose_-water, and either  _White_ wine, or _Clarret_ wine, and let all these seeth together a  while, and serve it upon Sopps with your _Capon_.      _A Lemmond Sallet_.    Cut out slices of the peele of the Lemmons, long wayes, a quarter  of an inch one piece from another, and then slice the _Lemmons_  very thin, and lay them in a dish crosse, and the peeles about  the _Lemmons_, and scrape a good deal of _Suggar_ upon them, and  so serve them.           *       *       *       *       *          _Of Quinces_.      _The best way to Preserve Quinces._    First pare and coare the _Quinces_, and boyle them in faire water  till they be very tender, not covering them, then taking them  out of the water, take to every pound of them, two pound of _Sugar_,  and half a pint of water, boyle it to a Syrupe, scumming it well,  then put in some of the Jelly that is washed from the _Quince_ kernels,  and after that, making it boyle a little, put in your _Quinces_,  boyle them very fast, keeping the holes upward as neer as you  can, for fear of breaking, and when they are so tender that you  may thrust a rush through them, take them off, and put them up  in your glasses, having first saved some Syrupe till it be cold to fill  up your glasses.      _A speciall Remembrance in doing them_.    When you Preserve _Quinces_, or make _Marmalade_, take the Kernels  out of the raw _Quinces_, and wash off the Jelly that groweth  about them, in faire water, then straine the water and Jelly from  the kernels, through some fine Cobweb laune, and put the same  into the _Marmalade_, or preserved _Quinces_, when they are well  scum'd, but put not so much into your _Quinces_, as into the _Marmalade_,  for it will Jelly the Syrupe too much; put six or seven  spoonfulls of Syrupe into the Jelly. Before you put it into the  _Marmalade_, you must boyle your _Quinces_ more for _Marmalade_, then  to preserve your _Quinces_, and least of them when you make your  clear Cakes.    When you would preserve your _Quinces_ white, you must not  cover them in the boyling, and you must put halfe as much _Sugar_  more for the white, as for the other. When you would have them  red, you must cover them in the boyling.      [Illustration: Quince]      _To Pickle Quinces._    Boyle your _Quinces_ that you intend to keep, whole and unpared,  in faire water, till they be soft, but not too violently for feare you  break them, when they are soft take them out, and boyle some  _Quinces_ pared, quarter'd, and coar'd, and the parings of the _Quinces_  with them in the same liquor, to make it strong, and when  they have boyled a good time, enough to make the liquor of  sufficient strength, take out the quartered _Quinces_ and parings,  and put the liquor into a pot big enough to receive all the _Quinces_,  both whole and quartered, and put them into it, when the  liquor is thorow cold, and so keep them for your use close  covered.      _To make Quince Cakes_.    Prepare your _Quinces_, and take the just weight of them in _Sugar_,  beaten finely, and searcing halfe of it, then of the rest make  a Syrupe, using the ordinary proportion of a pint of water to a  pound of _Sugar_, let your _Quinces_ be well beaten, and when the  Syrupe is cand height, put in your _Quince_, and boyle it to a past,  keeping it with continuall stirring, then work it up with the beaten  _Sugar_ which you reserved, and these Cakes will tast well of the  _Quinces_.      _To make Printed Quidony of Quinces_.    Take two pound of _Quinces_, paired, coared, and cut in small  pieces, and put them into a faire posnet, with a quart of faire water,  and when they are boyled tender, put into them one pound  of _Sugar_ clarified, with halfe a pint of faire water, let them boyle  till all the fruit fall to the bottom of the posnet, then let the liquid  substance run through a faire linnen cloath into a clean bason,  then put it into a posnet, and let it boyle till it come to a jelly,  then Print it in your Moulds, and turne it into your boxes.
