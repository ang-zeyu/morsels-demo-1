Double Runner,  Small Leggings, Mad Wolf, and the Little Blackfoot were smoking and  talking, and I was writing in my note-book. As I put aside the book, and  reached out my hand for the pipe, Double Runner bent over and picked up a  scrap of printed paper, which had fallen to the ground. He looked at it for  a moment without speaking, and then, holding it up and calling me by name,  said:--    \"_Pi-nut-u-ye is-tsim-okan,_ this is education. Here is the difference  between you and me, between the Indians and the white people. You know what  this means. I do not. If I did know, I should be as smart as you. If all  my people knew, the white people would not always get the best of us.\"    \"_Nisah_ (elder brother), your words are true. Therefore you ought to see  that your children go to school, so that they may get the white man's  knowledge. When they are men, they will have to trade with the white  people; and if they know nothing, they can never get rich. The times have  changed. It will never again be as it was when you and I were young.\"    \"You say well, _Pi-nut-u-ye is-tsim-okan,_ I have seen the days; and I know  it is so. The old things are passing away, and the children of my children  will be like white people. None of them will know how it used to be in  their father's days unless they read the things which we have told you, and  which you are all the time writing down in your books.\"    \"They are all written down, _Nisah_, the story of the three tribes,  Sik-si-kau, Kainah, and Pik[)u]ni.\"          INDIANS AND THEIR STORIES      The most shameful chapter of American history is that in which is recorded  the account of our dealings with the Indians. The story of our government's  intercourse with this race is an unbroken narrative of injustice, fraud,  and robbery. Our people have disregarded honesty and truth whenever they  have come in contact with the Indian, and he has had no rights because he  has never had the power to enforce any.    Protests against governmental swindling of these savages have been made  again and again, but such remonstrances attract no general  attention. Almost every one is ready to acknowledge that in the past the  Indians have been shamefully robbed, but it appears to be believed that  this no longer takes place. This is a great mistake. We treat them now much  as we have always treated them. Within two years, I have been present on a  reservation where government commissioners, by means of threats, by bribes  given to chiefs, and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees,  succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them  in asserting that a tribe of Indians, entirely wild and totally ignorant of  farming, had consented to sell their lands, and to settle down each upon  160 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the North  American continent. The fraud perpetrated on this tribe was as gross as  could be practised by one set of men upon another. In a similar way the  Southern Utes were recently induced to consent to give up their reservation  for another.      Americans are a conscientious people, yet they take no interest in these  frauds. They have the Anglo-Saxon spirit of fair play, which sympathizes  with weakness, yet no protest is made against the oppression which the  Indian suffers. They are generous; a famine in Ireland, Japan, or Russia  arouses the sympathy and calls forth the bounty of the nation, yet they  give no heed to the distress of the Indians, who are in the very midst of  them. They do not realize that Indians are human beings like themselves.    For this state of things there must be a reason, and this reason is to be  found, I believe, in the fact that practically no one has any personal  knowledge of the Indian race. The few who are acquainted with them are  neither writers nor public speakers, and for the most part would find it  easier to break a horse than to write a letter. If the general public knows  little of this race, those who legislate about them are equally  ignorant. From the congressional page who distributes the copies of a  pending bill, up through the representatives and senators who vote for it,  to the president whose signature makes the measure a law, all are entirely  unacquainted with this people or their needs.    Many stories about Indians have been written, some of which are interesting  and some, perhaps, true. All, however, have been written by civilized  people, and have thus of necessity been misleading. The reason for this is  plain. The white person who gives his idea of a story of Indian life  inevitably looks at things from the civilized point of view, and assigns to  the Indian such motives and feelings as govern the civilized man. But often  the feelings which lead an Indian to perform a particular action are not  those which would induce a white man to do the same thing, or if they are,  the train of reasoning which led up to the Indian's motive is not the  reasoning of the white man.    In a volume about the Pawnees,[1] I endeavored to show how Indians think  and feel by letting some of them tell their own stories in their own  fashion, and thus explain in their own way how they look at the every-day  occurrences of their life, what motives govern them, and how they reason.    [Footnote 1: Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk-Tales.]    In the present volume, I treat of another race of Indians in precisely the  same way. I give the Blackfoot stories as they have been told to me by the  Indians themselves, not elaborating nor adding to them. In all cases except  one they were written down as they fell from the lips of the storyteller.  Sometimes I have transposed a sentence or two, or have added a few words of  explanation; but the stories as here given are told in the words of the  original narrators as nearly as it is possible to render those words into  the simplest every-day English. These are Indians' stories, pictures of  Indian life drawn by Indian artists, and showing this life from the  Indian's point of view. Those who read these stories will have the  narratives just as they came to me from the lips of the Indians themselves;  and from the tales they can get a true notion of the real man who is  speaking. He is not the Indian of the newspapers, nor of the novel, nor of  the Eastern sentimentalist, nor of the Western boomer, but the real Indian  as he is in his daily life among his own people, his friends, where he is  not embarrassed by the presence of strangers, nor trying to produce  effects, but is himself--the true, natural man.    And when you are talking with your Indian friend, as you sit beside him and  smoke with him on the bare prairie during a halt in the day's march, or at  night lie at length about your lonely camp fire in the mountains, or form  one of a circle of feasters in his home lodge, you get very near to  nature. Some of the sentiments which he expresses may horrify your  civilized mind, but they are not unlike those which your own small boy  might utter. The Indian talks of blood and wounds and death in a  commonplace, matter-of-fact way that may startle you. But these things used  to be a part of his daily life; and even to-day you may sometimes hear a  dried-up, palsied survivor of the ancient wars cackle out his shrill laugh  when he tells as a merry jest, a bloodcurdling story of the torture he  inflicted on some enemy in the long ago.    I have elsewhere expressed my views on Indian character, the conclusions  founded on an acquaintance with this race extending over more than twenty  years, during which time I have met many tribes, with some of whom I have  lived on terms of the closest intimacy.    The Indian is a man, not very different from his white brother, except that  he is undeveloped. In his natural state he is kind and affectionate in his  family, is hospitable, honest and straightforward with his fellows,--a true  friend. If you are his guest, the best he has is at your disposal; if the  camp is starving, you will still have set before you your share of what  food there may be in the lodge. For his friend he will die, if need be. He  is glad to perform acts of kindness for those he likes. While travelling in  the heats of summer over long, waterless stretches of prairie, I have had  an Indian, who saw me suffering from thirst, leave me, without mentioning  his errand, and ride thirty miles to fetch me a canteen of cool water.    The Indian is intensely religious. No people pray more earnestly nor more  frequently. This is especially true of all Indians of the Plains.    The Indian has the mind and feelings of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#1)"],[1,"STRANGER THAN FICTION    THE WONDERS OF PRAYER:    A RECORD OF WELL AUTHENTICATED AND WONDERFUL ANSWERS TO PRAYER.

WHITTLE.    1885           *       *       *       *       *          INTRODUCTION TO FIRST EDITION.      The incidents which are published in this volume, are vouched for upon  the strongest proofs of authenticity possible to obtain, and are either  of circumstances known amid my own experience, or connected with the  lives of my correspondents and their friends. They are the thankful  record and tribute to the power of _persevering faith_.    Nothing has been published concerning which there is the least shadow of  doubt. All have been carefully investigated.    Every case has been one of real prayer, and the results that have come,  came only in answer to the prayer of faith, and were not possible to  obtain without it.    They demonstrate to a wonderful degree, the immediate practical ways of  the Lord with his children in this world, that He is far nearer and more  intimate with their plans and pursuits than it is possible for them to  realize.    Neither have we depended upon the relation of facts of a few, to  convince the world of the real power of faith, but have added concurrent  testimony of incidents actually known in the experience of such eminent  clergymen as Charles Spurgeon, Newman Hall, Martin Luther, W.  Huntington, Dr. Waterbury, George Muller, Dr. Cullis, Dr. Patton, Dr.  Adams, Dr. Prime, Bishop Simpson, and many others.    Also we have added some incidents known and investigated and found  absolutely true, by the editors of the following journals, who add their  unquestioning belief in the power of prayer: _The Christian, The  Evangelist, The Observer, The Congregationalist, The Advance, The  Illustrated Christian Weekly, The American Messenger, The Witness_.  Likewise we have been greatly assisted by some of our Home Missionaries,  who, from their daily experiences with the poor and suffering, have been  eye-witnesses to remarkable experiences and the wonderful help of the  Lord in answering their prayers.    These testimonies here recorded must be accepted as true. They  demonstrate that answers to prayer are not occasional, and therefore  remarkable that they do occur, but are of constant occurrence.    There may be many minds who, having carried no trial to the Lord, have  never been brought into intimate acquaintances of the ways in which the  Lord tries the faith of his children, nor led to see and observe his  wonderful control over human wills and circumstances. The power of the  Lord is learned only by those who in deep trouble have faithfully sought  Him and seen his ways of deliverance.    None can ever understand the full power of prayer until they have  learned the lesson of trust. It is only when for the _first time_ in the  Christian's own life of faith, it realizes the hand of God in his  personal dealings with him, how near He is, or how clearly he feels the  presence of that tremendous overruling Spirit which        \"_Turneth the heart whithersoever He will_.\"    The actual existence of our God is therefore proved, not alone from  _History_, nor from the Bible alone, nor from current natural or  religious feeling and beliefs, nor from the testimony of old witnesses  several thousand years old, _but from the actual incidents of present  prayer_, and the _literal answer_. Daily faith and trust and prayer have  made the Christian deeply acquainted with Him and his ways, and humbly  dependent upon his care and love and help, in the events of life. _No  one ever faithfully trusted the Lord in vain_.    Circumstances so clouded that it has been impossible for men to control,  have, through believing prayer, been so made to change, that through  them has been revealed _living evidences_ of the presence of        _The Ever Living God_.           *       *       *       *       *          DISCERNING PRAYER.      INTRODUCTORY.      BY D.W. WHITTLE.      To recognize God's existence is to necessitate prayer to Him, by all  intelligent creatures, or, a consciously living in sin and under  condemnation of conscience, because they do not pray to Him. It would be  horrible to admit the existence of a Supreme Being, with power and  wisdom to create, and believe that the creatures he thought of  consequence and importance enough to bring into existence, are not of  enough consequence for him to pay any attention to in the troubles and  trials consequent upon that existence.    Surely such a statement is an impeachment of both the wisdom and  goodness of God.    It were far more sensible for those who deny the fitness and necessity  of prayer to take the ground of the atheist and say plainly \"We do not  pray, for there is no God to pray to,\" for to deny prayer, is practical  atheism.    So in the very constitution of man's being there is the highest  reasonableness in prayer. And, if the position of man in his relation to  the earth he inhabits is recognized and understood, there is no  unreasonableness in a God-fearing man looking to God for help and  deliverance under any and all circumstances, in all the vicissitudes of  life. The earth was _made_ for man. One has said \"there is nothing great  in the world but man; and there is nothing great in man but his soul.\"  With this in view, how absurd to talk about \"fixed laws\" and  \"unchangeable order,\" in a way to keep man in his trouble from God. It  is all the twaddle of the conceit of man setting himself up to judge and  limit his maker. \"To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal?  saith the Holy One.\" The Creator is greater than his creation; the law  giver is supreme over all law. He created the earth that it might be  inhabited by man, and He governs the earth in subordination to the  interests, the eternal and spiritual welfare of the race of immortal  beings that are here being prepared for glory and immortality.    Laws, indeed, are fixed in their operation and results as subserving the  highest good in the training and the disciplining of the race, giving  them hope in their labor and sure expectation of fruit from their toil.  But as set in operation for _man's good_, so, in an exigency that may  make necessary their suspension, to secure his deliverance from peril  and bring man back to the recognition of the personal God, as above,  law, is it unreasonable to believe that God has power thus to suspend or  overrule his own arrangements? A wise father will govern his children by  rules as securing their best good. But he will retain in his power the  suspending of those rules when special occasions arise, when the object  for which they exist can be better secured by their suspension. Shall  not the living God have the same right?    So much as to the reflections suggested by the dogmas of natural  religion. They sustain in reason our faith in prayer. The basis,  however, of our faith rests upon the unchanging and unchangeable  revelation of God, and not upon man's philosophy. Jesus taught his  disciples to pray, saying, \"Our Father which art in Heaven.\" As  Christians, this is our authority for prayer. In the words, \"OUR  FATHER,\" our Blessed Lord has given us the substance of all that can be  said, as to _the privilege of prayer, what to pray for_, and _how to  pray_. There can be no loftier exercise of soul ever given to created  intelligence than to come into conscious contact with the living God,  and be able to say \"_My_ Father.\"    And surely, as my Father, with a loving father's heart, it must be his  desire that I should tell him _all_ my needs, _all_ my sorrows, _all_ my  desires. And, so his word commands, \"Be careful for nothing, but _in  everything_, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your  requests be made known unto God.\" (Phil, iv., 6.) Under this verse there  is positively no exception of any request that may not be made known  unto God. So there is true faith and right Christian philosophy in the  remark, \"if a _pin_ was needful to my happiness and I could not find one  I would pray to God for it.\"    The mistake of Christians is in _not_ praying over _little_ things. \"The  hairs of your head are all numbered.\" Consult God about everything.  Expect His counsel, His guidance, His care, His provision, His  deliverance, His blessing, in everything. Does not the expression, \"Our  _daily_ bread,\" mean just this? Can there be any true life of faith that  does not include this? Whatever will serve to help God's children to a  better understanding of the blessed privileges of prayer, and prove to  them the reality of God's answering prayer in the cares, trials and  troubles of _daily life_, will approve itself to all thoughtful minds as  a blessing to them and an honor to God. It is the purpose of this volume  to do this. We are more helped by testimony to _facts_ than by theories  and doctrines. When we have illustrations before our eyes of God's care  for his children, and His response to their faith, even in the minutest  things, we understand the meaning of His promises and the reality of His  providences.    The writer had many thoughts in this line suggested to him by an  incident, with which he was connected, in the life of George Muller. It  was my happiness to cross the Atlantic in the company of this dear  brother on the steamship Sardinian, from Quebec to Liverpool, in June,  1880.    I met Mr. Muller in the express office the morning of sailing, about  half an hour before the tender was to take the passengers to the ship.
