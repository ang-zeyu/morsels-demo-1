TRUE STORIES OF CRIME  FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE    BY ARTHUR TRAIN    FORMERLY DISTRICT ATTORNEY  NEW YORK COUNTY    1908          PREFACE      The narratives composing this book are literally true stories of crime.  In a majority of the cases the author conducted the prosecutions  himself, and therefore may claim to have a personal knowledge of that  whereof he speaks. While no confidence has been abused, no essential  facts have been omitted, distorted, or colored, and the accounts  themselves, being all matters of public record, may be easily verified.    The scenes recorded here are not literature but history, and the  characters who figure in them are not puppets of the imagination, but  men and women who lived and schemed, laughed, sinned and suffered, and  paid the price when the time came, most of them, without flinching. A  few of those who read these pages may profit perhaps by their example;  others may gain somewhat in their knowledge of life and human nature;  but all will agree that there are books in the running brooks, even if  the streams be turbid, and sermons in stones, though these be the hearts  of men. If in some instances the narratives savor in treatment more of  fiction than of fact, the writer must plead guilty to having fallen  under the spell of the romance of his subject, and he proffers the  excuse that, whereas such tales have lost nothing in accuracy, they may  have gained in the truth of their final impression.

Having  selected one to his fancy and arranged for some alterations, he produced  from his wallet a check for $280, drawn to the order of George B. Lang,  and signed E. Bierstadt, and remarked to the attentive salesman:    \"I haven't got quite enough cash with me to pay for these, but I have  been intending to cash this check all the afternoon. Of course, you  don't know me or even that my name is Lang, but if you will forward the  check to the bank they will certify it, and to-morrow I will send for  the suit and the balance of the money.\"    \"Certainly, Mr. Lang,\" replied the salesman. \"I will hold the suit and  the money to await your orders.\"    The customer thanked him and took his departure. The check was sent to  the bank, the bank certified it, then cancelled its certification and  returned the check to Rogers, Peet & Company, and the store detectives,  having communicated with Police Headquarters, anxiously awaited the  arrival of Mr. Lang's messenger.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Envelope on the back of which Parker's forged  order was written.]    Their efforts were rewarded a couple of days later by the appearance at  the store of a lad who presented a written order (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2)  inscribed upon the back of an envelope bearing a cancelled stamp and  addressed to Geo. B. Lang, No. 13 West Twenty-sixth Street, New York  City, which read as follows:        ROGERS, PEET & Co.        Please give to bearer the clothes I purchased on      Tuesday--suit--pants--S. coat, and also kindly put change in      envelope in inside coat pocket.  Trusting the alterations are      satisfactory, and thanking you in advance for the favor and for past      courtesies, I am,        Resp. yours,        GEO. B. LANG.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Parker's order on Rogers, Peet & Company, in the  name of Lang.]    The boy was immediately placed under arrest, and after proclaiming his  own innocence and vociferating that he was only doing an errand for a  \"gent,\" who was waiting close by, was directed to return with his bundle  as if nothing had occurred. This he did, and Mr. George B. Lang was  soon in the clutches of the law.    Interrogated by his captors, the supposed Lang admitted that his real  name was James Parker, that he lived at 110 West Thirty-eighth Street,  and only requested that his wife be immediately notified of what had  happened. At Headquarters the prisoner was identified as a gentleman who  had been very actively engaged during the preceding months in passing  bad checks throughout the city, his more recent operations having  consisted in cashing a check on the Lincoln National Bank for $160 on  July 20th, one for $290 on the same bank on July 30th, still another for  $510.50 on August 4th, and one for $440.50 on the National Shoe and  Leather Bank, \"to bearer,\" on August 8th. This last, in some  inexplicable way, had been cashed at the very bank itself.    Believing that the forger had at last been caught, the precinct  detectives later on, during the evening of Parker's arrest, visited no  West Thirty-eighth Street, and on inquiring for \"Mrs. Parker,\" were  introduced to a young girl of attractive appearance to whom they  delivered their unwelcome message. Mrs. Parker seemed overwhelmed at the  news and strongly asserted her confidence in her husband's innocence of  any wrong-doing. Having performed their errand the officers departed.    A certain ineradicable jealousy has always existed between the  plain-clothes men of the various precincts and the sleuths attached to  the Central Office, and in this instance the precinct men, having gained  the credit for the arrest, it did not occur to them as necessary to  communicate the knowledge of their acquaintance with Mrs. Parker to  Detective Sergeants Peabody and Clark, originally assigned at  Headquarters to investigate the case.    It seemed, however, to Peabody very unlikely that Parker had conducted  his operations alone, and he therefore at once inquired at the Tombs  what character of visitors came to see the prisoner. The gateman replied  that as yet none had arrived. At that very instant a young girl stepped  to the wicket and asked if she could be allowed to see Mr. James Parker.  It took the detective but a moment to run across to the Criminal Courts  Building and to telephone the warden to detain her temporarily and then  to refuse her request. Five minutes later the girl emerged  disconsolately from the Tombs and boarded a car going uptown. Peabody  followed her to 110 West Thirty-eighth Street, not for an instant  supposing that the girl herself could be the forger, but believing that  possibly through her he might learn of other members of the gang and  secure additional evidence against Parker himself.    Of course, no intelligent person to-day supposes that, outside of Sir  Conan Doyle's interesting novels, detectives seek the baffling criminal  by means of analyzing cigar butts, magnifying thumb marks or  specializing in the various perfumes in favor among the fair sex, or by  any of those complicated, brain fatiguing processes of ratiocination  indulged in by our old friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There are still,  however, genuine detectives, and some of them are to be found upon the  New York police force. The magnifying glass is not one of the ordinary  tools of the professional sleuth, and if he carries a pistol at all it  is because the police rules require it, while those cases may be  numbered upon the fingers of two hands where his own hair and whiskers  are not entirely sufficient for his purposes in the course of his  professional career.    The next morning Peabody donned the most disreputable suit in his  wardrobe, neglected his ordinary visit to the barber, and called at 110  West Thirty-eighth Street, being, of course, at this time entirely  unaware of the fact that the girl was Parker's wife. He found her  sitting in a rocking chair in a comfortable, well-furnished room, and  reading a magazine. Assuming an expression of sheepish inanity he  informed her that he was an old pal of \"Jim's\" who had been so  unfortunate as to be locked up in the same cell with him at  Headquarters, and that the latter was in desperate need of morphine.  That Parker was an habitual user of the drug could be easily seen from  the most casual inspection, but that it would prove an open"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#1)"],[1,"book was produced from images from Feeding America: The Historic  American Cookbook Project at Michigan State University                      Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes By Miss Parloa    and    Home Made Candy Recipes By Mrs. Janet McKenzie Hill      Compliments of Walter Baker & Co., Ltd.

FLOOR SPACE, 350,000 SQUARE FEET.]          Cocoa and Chocolate    The term \"Cocoa,\" a corruption of \"Cacao,\" is almost universally used in  English-speaking countries to designate the seeds of the small tropical  tree known to botanists as THEOBROMA CACAO, from which a great variety  of preparations under the name of cocoa and chocolate for eating and  drinking are made. The name \"Chocolatl\" is nearly the same in most  European languages, and is taken from the Mexican name of the drink,  \"Chocolate\" or \"Cacahuatl.\" The Spaniards found chocolate in common use  among the Mexicans at the time of the invasion under Cortez in 1519, and  it was introduced into Spain immediately after. The Mexicans not only  used chocolate as a staple article of food, but they used the seeds of  the cacao tree as a medium of exchange.    No better evidence could be offered of the great advance which has been  made in recent years in the knowledge of dietetics than the remarkable  increase in the consumption of cocoa and chocolate in this country. The  amount retained for home consumption in 1860 was only 1,181,054  pounds--about 3-5 of an ounce for each inhabitant. The amount retained  for home consumption for the year ending Dec. 31, 1908, was 93,956,721  pounds--over 16 ounces for each inhabitant.    Although there was a marked increase in the consumption of tea and  coffee during the same period, the ratio of increase fell far below that  of cocoa. It is evident that the coming American is going to be less of  a tea and coffee drinker, and more of a cocoa and chocolate drinker.  This is the natural result of a better knowledge of the laws of health,  and of the food value of a beverage which nourishes the body while it  also stimulates the brain.    Baron von Liebig, one of the best-known writers on dietetics, says:    \"It is a perfect food, as wholesome as delicious, a beneficient restorer  of exhausted power; but its quality must be good and it must be  carefully prepared. It is highly nourishing and easily digested, and is  fitted to repair wasted strength, preserve health, and prolong life. It  agrees with dry temperaments and convalescents; with mothers who nurse  their children; with those whose occupations oblige them to undergo  severe mental strains; with public speakers, and with all those who give  to work a portion of the time needed for sleep. It soothes both stomach  and brain, and for this reason, as well as for others, it is the best  friend of those engaged in literary pursuits.\"    M. Brillat-Savarin, in his entertaining and valuable work, _Physiologie  du Gout_, says: \"Chocolate came over the mountains [from Spain to  France] with Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III and queen of Louis  XIII. The Spanish monks also spread the knowledge of it by the presents  they made to their brothers in France. It is well known that Linnaeus  called the fruit of the cocoa tree _theobroma_, 'food for the gods.' The  cause of this emphatic qualification has been sought, and attributed by  some to the fact that he was extravagantly fond of chocolate; by others  to his desire to please his confessor; and by others to his gallantry, a  queen having first introduced it into France.    \"The Spanish ladies of the New World, it is said, carried their love for  chocolate to such a degree that, not content with partaking of it  several times a day, they had it sometimes carried after them to church.  This favoring of the senses often drew upon them the censures of the  bishop; but the Reverend Father Escobar, whose metaphysics were as  subtle as his morality was accommodating, declared, formally, that a  fast was not broken by chocolate prepared with water; thus wire-drawing,  in favor of his penitents, the ancient adage, '_Liquidum non frangit  jejunium._'    \"Time and experience,\" he says further, \"have shown that chocolate,  carefully prepared, is an article of food as wholesome as it is  agreeable; that it is nourishing, easy of digestion, and does not  possess those qualities injurious to beauty with which coffee has been  reproached; that it is excellently adapted to persons who are obliged to  a great concentration of intellect; in the toils of the pulpit or the  bar, and especially to travellers; that it suits the most feeble  stomach; that excellent effects have been produced by it in chronic  complaints, and that it is a last resource in affections of the pylorus.    \"Some persons complain of being unable to digest chocolate; others, on  the contrary, pretend that it has not sufficient nourishment, and that  the effect disappears too soon. It is probable that the former have only  themselves to blame, and that the chocolate which they use is of bad  quality or badly made; for good and well-made chocolate must suit every  stomach which retains the slightest digestive power.    \"In regard to the others, the remedy is an easy one: they should  reinforce their breakfast with a _pate_, a cutlet, or a kidney, moisten  the whole with a good draught of soconusco chocolate, and thank God for  a stomach of such superior activity.    \"This gives me an opportunity to make an observation whose accuracy may  be depended upon.    \"After a good, complete, and copious breakfast, if we take, in addition,  a cup of well-made chocolate, digestion will be perfectly accomplished  in three hours, and we may dine whenever we like. Out of zeal for  science, and by dint of eloquence, I have induced many ladies to try  this experiment. They all declared, in the beginning, that it would kill  them; but they have all thriven on it and have not failed to glorify  their teacher.    \"The people who make constant use of chocolate are the ones who enjoy  the most steady health, and are the least subject to a multitude of  little ailments which destroy the comfort of life; their plumpness is  also more equal. These are two advantages which every one may verify  among his own friends, and wherever the practice is in use.\"    In corroboration of M. Brillat-Savarin's statement as to the value of  chocolate as an aid to digestion, we may quote from one of Mme. de  Sevigne's letters to her daughter:    \"I took chocolate night before last to digest my dinner, in order to  have a good supper. I took some yesterday for nourishment, so as to be  able to fast until night. What I consider amusing about chocolate is  that it acts according to the wishes of the one who takes it.\"    Chocolate appears to have been highly valued as a remedial agent by the  leading physicians of that day. Christoph Ludwig Hoffman wrote a  treatise entitled, \"Potus Chocolate,\" in which he recommended it in many  diseases, and instanced the case of Cardinal Richelieu, who, he stated,  was cured of general atrophy by its use.    A French officer who served in the West Indies for a period of fifteen  years, during the early part of the last century, wrote, as the result  of his personal observations, a treatise on \"The Natural History of  Chocolate, Being a distinct and Particular Account of the Cacao Tree,  its Growth and Culture, and the Preparation, Excellent Properties, and  Medicinal Virtues of its Fruit,\" which received the approbation of the  Regent of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, and which was translated and  published in London, in 1730. After describing the different methods of  raising and curing the fruit and preparing it for food (which it is not  worth while to reproduce here, as the methods have essentially changed  since that time), he goes on to demonstrate, as the result of actual  experiment, that chocolate is a substance \"very temperate, very  nourishing, and of easy digestion; very proper to repair the exhausted  spirits and decayed strength; and very suitable to preserve the health  and prolong the lives of old men....    \"I could produce several instances,\" he says, \"in favor of this  excellent nourishment; but I shall content myself with two only, equally  certain and decisive, in proof of its goodness. The first is an  experiment of chocolate's being taken for the only nourishment--made by  a surgeon's wife of Martinico. She had lost, by a very deplorable  accident, her lower jaw, which reduced her to such a condition that she  did not know how to subsist. She was not capable of taking anything  solid, and not rich enough to live upon jellies and nourishing broths.  In this strait she determined to take three dishes of chocolate,  prepared after the manner of the country, one in the morning, one at  noon, and one at night. There chocolate is nothing else but cocoa  kernels dissolved in hot water, with sugar, and seasoned with a bit of  cinnamon. This new way of life succeeded so well that she has lived a  long while since, more lively and robust than before this accident.    \"I had the second relation from a gentleman of Martinico, and one of my  friends not capable of a falsity. He assured me that in his neighborhood  an infant of four months old unfortunately lost his nurse, and its  parents not being able to put it to another, resolved, through  necessity, to feed it with chocolate. The success was very happy, for  the infant came on to a miracle, and was neither less healthy nor less  vigorous than those who are brought up by the best nurses.    \"Before chocolate was known in Europe, good old wine was called the milk  of old men; but this title is now applied with greater reason to  chocolate, since its use has become so common that it has been perceived  that chocolate is, with respect to them, what milk is to"]]]
