HAD I INTENDED TO DEDICATE THIS VOLUME, I SHOULD HAVE INSCRIBED IT TO  A NOBLEMAN WHOSE EXERTIONS IN PROMOTING EVERY OBJECT THAT CAN ADVANCE  SCIENCE REFLECT LUSTRE UPON HIS RANK. BUT THE KINDNESS OF HIS NATURE  MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAINED AT HAVING HIS NAME CONNECTED WITH STRICTURES,  PERHAPS TOO SEVERELY JUST. I SHALL, THEREFORE, ABSTAIN FROM MENTIONING  THE NAME OF ONE WHO WILL FEEL THAT HE HAS COMMANDED MY ESTEEM AND  RESPECT.    C. BABBAGE.      DORSET STREET, MANCHESTER SQUARE, 29th April, 1830.          PREFACE.      Of the causes which have induced me to print this volume I have little  to say; my own opinion is, that it will ultimately do some service  to science, and without that belief I would not have undertaken so  thankless a task. That it is too true not to make enemies, is an opinion  in which I concur with several of my friends, although I should hope  that what I have written will not give just reason for the permanence of  such feelings. On one point I shall speak decidedly, it is not connected  in any degree with the calculating machine on which I have been engaged;  the causes which have led to it have been long operating, and would have  produced this result whether I had ever speculated on that subject, and  whatever might have been the fate of my speculations.    If any one shall endeavour to account for the opinions stated in these  pages by ascribing them to any imagined circumstance peculiar to myself,  I think he will be mistaken. That science has long been neglected and  declining in England, is not an opinion originating with me, but is  shared by many, and has been expressed by higher authority than mine. I  shall offer a few notices on this subject, which, from their scattered  position, are unlikely to have met the reader's attention, and which,  when combined with the facts I have detailed in subsequent pages, will  be admitted to deserve considerable attention. The following extract  from the article Chemistry, in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, is from  the pen of a gentleman equally qualified by his extensive reading, and  from his acquaintance with foreign nations, to form an opinion entitled  to respect. Differing from him widely as to the cause, I may be  permitted to cite him as high authority for the fact.    \"In concluding this most circumscribed outline of the History of  Chemistry, we may perhaps be allowed to express a faint shade of regret,  which, nevertheless, has frequently passed over our minds within the  space of the last five or six years. Admiring, as we most sincerely do,  the electro-magnetic discoveries of Professor Oersted and his followers,  we still, as chemists, fear that our science has suffered some degree  of neglect in consequence of them. At least, we remark that, during this  period, good chemical analyses and researches have been rare in England;  and yet, it must be confessed, there is an ample field for chemical  discovery. How scanty is our knowledge of the suspected fluorine! Are  we sure that we understand the nature of nitrogen? And yet these are  amongst our elements. Much has been done by Wollaston, Berzelius,  Guy-Lussac, Thenard, Thomson, Prout, and others, with regard to the  doctrine of definite proportions; but there yet remains the Atomic  Theory. Is it a representation of the laws of nature, or is it  not?\"---CHEMISTRY, ENCYC. METROP. p.596.    When the present volume was considerably advanced, the public were  informed that the late Sir Humphry Davy had commenced a work, having the  same title as the present, and that his sentiments were expressed in the  language of feeling and of eloquence. It is to be hoped that it may be  allowed by his friends to convey his opinions to posterity, and that the  writings of the philosopher may enable his contemporaries to forget some  of the deeds of the President of the Royal Society.    Whatever may be the fate of that highly interesting document, we may  infer his opinions upon this subject from a sentiment expressed in his  last work:--    \"--But we may in vain search the aristocracy now for  philosophers.\"----\"There are very few persons who pursue science with  true dignity; it is followed more as connected with objects of profit  than those of fame.\"--SIR H. DAVY'S CONSOLATIONS IN TRAVEL.    The last authority which I shall adduce is more valuable, from the  varied acquirements of its author, and from the greater detail into  which he enters. \"We have drawn largely, both in the present Essay, and  in our article on LIGHT, from the ANNALES DE CHEMIE, and we take this  ONLY opportunity distinctly to acknowledge our obligations to that most  admirably conducted work. Unlike the crude and undigested scientific  matter which suffices, (we are ashamed to say it) for the monthly and  quarterly amusement of our own countrymen, whatever is admitted into ITS  pages, has at least been taken pains with, and, with few exceptions, has  sterling merit. Indeed, among the original communications which  abound in it, there are few which would misbecome the first academical  collections; and if any thing could diminish our regret at the long  suppression of those noble memoirs, which are destined to adorn future  volumes of that of the Institute, it would be the masterly abstracts  of them which from time to time appear in the ANNALES, either from the  hands of the authors, or from the reports rendered by the committees  appointed to examine them; which latter, indeed, are universally models  of their kind, and have contributed, perhaps more than any thing, to the  high scientific tone of the French SAVANS. What author, indeed, but  will write his best, when he knows that his work, if it have merit, will  immediately be reported on by a committee, who will enter into all its  meaning; understand it, however profound: and, not content with MERELY  understanding it, pursue the trains of thought to which it leads; place  its discoveries and principles in new and unexpected lights; and bring  the whole of their knowledge of collateral subjects to bear upon it. Nor  ought we to omit our acknowledgement to the very valuable Journals of  Poggendorff and Schweigger. Less exclusively national than their Gallic  compeer, they present a picture of the actual progress of physical  science throughout Europe. Indeed, we have been often astonished to  see with what celerity every thing, even moderately valuable in the  scientific publications of this country, finds its way into their pages.  This ought to encourage our men of science. They have a larger audience,  and a wider sympathy than they are perhaps aware of; and however  disheartening the general diffusion of smatterings of a number of  subjects, and the almost equally general indifference to profound  knowledge in any, among their own countrymen, may be, they may rest  assured that not a fact they may discover, nor a good experiment they  may make, but is instantly repeated, verified, and commented upon, in  Germany, and, we may add too, in Italy. We wish the obligation were  mutual. Here, whole branches of continental discovery are unstudied,  and indeed almost unknown, even by name. It is in vain to conceal the  melancholy truth. We are fast dropping behind. In mathematics we have  long since drawn the rein, and given over a hopeless race. In  chemistry the case is not much better. Who can tell us any thing of the  Sulfo-salts? Who will explain to us the laws of Isomorphism? Nay, who  among us has even verified Thenard's experiments on the oxygenated  acids,--Oersted's and Berzelius's on the radicals of the  earths,--Balard's and Serrulas's on the combinations of Brome,--and a  hundred other splendid trains of research in that fascinating science?  Nor need we stop here. There are, indeed, few sciences which would not  furnish matter for similar remark. The causes are at once obvious and  deep-seated; but this is not the place to discuss them.\"--MR. HERSCHEL'S  TREATISE ON SOUND, printed in the ENCYCLOPAEDIA METROPOLITANA.    With such authorities, I need not apprehend much doubt as to the fact of  the decline of science in England: how far I may have pointed out some  of its causes, must be left to others to decide.    Many attacks have lately been made on the conduct of various scientific  bodies, and of their officers, and severe criticism has been lavished  upon some of their productions. Newspapers, Magazines, Reviews, and  Pamphlets, have all been put in requisition for the purpose. Odium has  been cast upon some of these for being anonymous. If a fact is to be  established by testimony, anonymous assertion is of no value; if it  can be proved, by evidence to which the public have access, it is of  no consequence (for the cause of truth) who produces it. A matter of  opinion derives weight from the name which is attached to it; but a  chain of reasoning is equally conclusive, whoever may be its author.    Perhaps it would be better for science, that all criticism should be  avowed. It would certainly have the effect of rendering it more matured,  and less severe; but, on the other hand, it would have the evil of  frequently repressing it altogether, because there exists amongst the  lower ranks of science, a \"GENUS IRRITABILE,\" who are disposed to argue  that every criticism is personal. It is clearly the interest of all who  fear inquiries, to push this principle as far as possible, whilst those  whose sole object is truth, can have no apprehensions from the severest  scrutiny. There are few circumstances which so strongly distinguish the  philosopher, as the calmness with which he can reply to criticisms he  may think undeservedly severe. I have been led into these reflections,  from the circumstance of its having been stated publicly, that I was  the author of several of those anonymous writings, which were considered  amongst "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#1)"],[1,"[S']AKOONTALA    OR THE LOST RING                AN INDIAN DRAMA              TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH PROSE AND VERSE  FROM THE SANSKRIT OF KALIDASA      BY      SIR MONIER MONIER-WILLIAMS, K.C.I.E.  M.A., D.C.L., LL.D., PH.D.  BODEN PROFESSOR OF SANSKRIT, HON. FELLOW OF UNIVERSITY  AND LATE FELLOW OF BALLIOL COLLEGE, OXFORD          PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION.    The fact that the following translation (first published in 1855) of  India's most celebrated drama has gone through seven editions, might  reasonably have absolved me from the duty of revising it.    Three years ago, however, I heard that Sir John Lubbock had thought  '[S']akoontala' worthy of a place among the hundred best books of the  world, and had adopted my version of the original. I therefore  undertook to go through every line and once again compare the  translation with the Sanskrit, in the hope that I might be able to  give a few finishing touches to a performance which, although it had  been before the public for about forty years, was certainly not  perfect. The act of revision was a labour of love, and I can honestly  say that I did my best to make my representation of Kalidasa's  immortal work as true and trustworthy as possible.    Another edition is now called for, but after a severely critical  examination of every word, I have only detected a few minor  unimportant points--and those only in the Introduction and Notes--in  which any alteration appeared to be desirable. Indeed it is probable  that the possessors of previous editions will scarcely perceive that  any alterations have been made anywhere.    Occasionally in the process of comparison a misgiving has troubled me,  and I have felt inclined to accuse myself of having taken, in some  cases, too great liberties with the Sanskrit original. But in the end  I have acquiesced in my first and still abiding conviction that a  literal translation (such as that which I have given in the notes of  my edition of the Sanskrit text) might have commended itself to  Oriental students, but would not have given a true idea of the beauty  of India's most cherished drama to general readers, whose minds are  cast in a European mould, and who require a translator to clothe  Oriental ideas, as far as practicable, in a dress conformable to  European canons of taste.    And most assuredly such a translation would never have adapted itself  to actual representation on a modern stage as readily as it now  appears that my free version has done. It has gratified me exceedingly  to find that youthful English-speaking Indians--cultured young men  educated at the Universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay--have acted  the [S']akoontala, in the very words of my translation with the greatest  success before appreciative audiences in various parts of India.    And lest any one in this country should be sceptical as to the  possibility of interesting a modern audience in a play written  possibly as early as the third or fourth century of our era (see p.  xvi), I here append an extract from a letter received by me in 1893  from Mr. V. Padmanabha Aiyar, B.A., resident at Karamanai, Trivandrum,  Travancore.    'SIVEN COIL STREET, TRIVANDRUM,    _'May 1, 1893_.    'The members of the \"Karamanai Young Men's Mutual Improvement Society\"  acted your translation of \"[S']akoontala\" on the 3rd and 5th of  September last year, in the Government Museum Theatre, Trivandrum.    'It was acted in two parts. On the first day Acts I to IV were acted,  and on the second the remaining three Acts.    'All our chief native officials and many Europeans and their ladies  honoured the occasion with their presence. We acted it a second time  at the special request of H.H. the Second Prince of Travancore, in the  Palace of His Highness' mother, the Junior Ranee.    'The public were kind enough to pronounce it a success. In many cases  the applause given was not so much for the acting as for the beauty of  your translation. The Hindus have a great liking for this play, and  not one of the enlightened Hindu community will fail to acknowledge  your translation to be a very perfect one. Our object in acting Hindu  plays is to bring home to the Hindus the good lessons that our ancient  authors are able to teach us. If there is one lesson in these days  more than another which familiarity with the fountains of Western  literature constantly forces upon the mind, it is that our age is  turning its back on time-honoured creeds and dogmas. We are hurrying  forward to a chaos in which all our existing beliefs, nay even the  fundamental axioms of morality, may in the end be submerged; and as  the general tenor of Indian thought among the educated community is to  reject everything that is old, and equally blindly to absorb  everything new, it becomes more and more an urgent question whether  any great intellectual or moral revolution, which has no foundations  in the past, can produce lasting benefits to the people.    '\"I desire no future that will break the ties of the past\" is what  George Eliot has said, and so it is highly necessary that the Hindus  should know something of their former greatness.    'The songs in [S']akoontala, one in the Prologue and another in the  beginning of the fifth Act, very easily adapted themselves to Hindu  tunes.'    Towards the end of his letter Mr. Aiyar intimated that he himself took  the part of Ma[T.]Havya. He also mentioned that a few modifications and  additions were introduced into some of the scenes.    In a subsequent letter received from Mr. Keshava Aiyar, the Secretary  of the Society, I was informed that my version of the Play was acted  again at Trivandrum in 1894.    These descriptions of the successful representation of the [S']akoontala  in Travancore justified me in expressing a hope that, as Kalidasa has  been called the Shakespeare of India, so the most renowned of his  three dramatic works might, with a few manifestly necessary  modifications, be some day represented, with equal success, before  English-speaking audiences in other parts of the world and especially  here in England. This hope has been realized, and quite recently my  translation has been successfully acted by amateur actors before a  London audience.    I venture, therefore, to add the expression of a further hope that  with the daily growth of interest in Oriental literature, and now that  the [S']akoontala forms one of Sir John Lubbock's literary series, it  may be more extensively read by the Rulers of India in all parts of  the Empire. Those who study it attentively cannot fail to become  better acquainted with the customs and habits of thought, past and  present, of the people committed to their sway.    And it cannot be too often repeated that our duty towards our great  Dependency requires us to do something more than merely rule justly.  We may impart high education, we may make good laws, we may administer  impartial justice, we may make roads, lay down railroads and  telegraphs, stimulate trade, accomplish amazing engineering  feats--like that lately achieved at Periyar--increase the wealth and  develop the resources of our vast Eastern territories; but unless we  seek to understand the inhabitants, unless we think it worth while to  study their ancient literatures, their religious ideas, and  time-honoured institutions, unless we find in them something to admire  and respect, we can never expect any reciprocity of esteem and respect  on their part--we can never look forward to a time when the present  partition-wall, which obstructs the free Interchange of social  relations between European and Asiatic races, will be entirely  removed.    MONIER MONIER-WILLIAMS, _December, 1898_.          INTRODUCTION      About a century has elapsed since the great English Orientalist, Sir  William Jones, astonished the learned world by the discovery of a  Sanskrit Dramatic Literature. He has himself given us the history of  this discovery. It appears that, on his arrival in Bengal, he was very  solicitous to procure access to certain books called Nataks, of which  he had read in one of the 'Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses' written by  the Jesuit Missionaries of China. But, although he sought information  by consulting both Brahmans and Europeans, he was wholly unable for  some time to satisfy his curiosity as to the nature of these books. It  was reported to him that they were not histories, as he had hoped, but  that they abounded with fables, and consisted of conversations in  prose and verse held before ancient Rajas, in their public assemblies.  Others, again, asserted that they were discourses on dancing, music,  and poetry. At length, a sensible Brahman, conversant with European  manners, removed all his doubts, and gave him no less delight than  surprise, by telling him that the English nation had compositions of  the same sort, which were publicly represented at Calcutta in the cold  season, and bore the name of 'plays.' The same Brahman, when asked  which of these Nataks was most universally esteemed, answered without  hesitation, '[S']akoontala.'    It may readily be imagined with what interest, the keen Orientalist  received this communication; with what rapidity he followed up the  clue; and, when at length his zeal was rewarded by actual possession  of a MS. copy of one of these dramas, with what avidity he proceeded  to explore the treasures which for eighteen hundred years had remained  as unknown to the European world as the gold-fields of Australia.    The earliest Sanskrit drama with which we are acquainted, the  'Clay-cart,' translated by my predecessor in the Boden Chair at  Oxford, Professor H.H. Wilson, is attributed to a regal author, King  [S']udraka, the date of whose reign cannot be fixed with any certainty,  though some have assigned it to the first or second century B.C.  Considering that the nations of Europe can scarcely be said to have  possessed a dramatic literature"]]]
