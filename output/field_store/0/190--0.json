The origin of these _Studies_ dates from many years back. As a youth I was  faced, as others are, by the problem of sex. Living partly in an  Australian city where the ways of life were plainly seen, partly in the  solitude of the bush, I was free both to contemplate and to meditate many  things. A resolve slowly grew up within me: one main part of my life-work  should be to make clear the problems of sex.    That was more than twenty years ago. Since then I can honestly say that in  all that I have done that resolve has never been very far from my  thoughts. I have always been slowly working up to this central problem;  and in a book published some three years ago--_Man and Woman: a Study of  Human Secondary Sexual Characters_--I put forward what was, in my own  eyes, an introduction to the study of the primary questions of sexual  psychology.    Now that I have at length reached the time for beginning to publish my  results, these results scarcely seem to me large. As a youth, I had hoped  to settle problems for those who came after; now I am quietly content if I  do little more than state them. For even that, I now think, is much; it is  at least the half of knowledge. In this particular field the evil of  ignorance is magnified by our efforts to suppress that which never can be  suppressed, though in the effort of suppression it may become perverted. I  have at least tried to find out what are the facts, among normal people as  well as among abnormal people; for, while it seems to me that the  physician's training is necessary in order to ascertain the facts, the  physician for the most part only obtains the abnormal facts, which alone  bring little light. I have tried to get at the facts, and, having got at  the facts, to look them simply and squarely in the face. If I cannot  perhaps turn the lock myself, I bring the key which can alone in the end  rightly open the door: the key of sincerity. That is my one panacea:  sincerity.    I know that many of my friends, people on whose side I, too, am to be  found, retort with another word: reticence. It is a mistake, they say, to  try to uncover these things; leave the sexual instincts alone, to grow up  and develop in the shy solitude they love, and they will be sure to grow  up and develop wholesomely. But, as a matter of fact, that is precisely  what we can not and will not ever allow them to do. There are very few  middle-aged men and women who can clearly recall the facts of their lives  and tell you in all honesty that their sexual instincts have developed  easily and wholesomely throughout. And it should not be difficult to see  why this is so. Let my friends try to transfer their feelings and theories  from the reproductive region to, let us say, the nutritive region, the  only other which can be compared to it for importance. Suppose that eating  and drinking was never spoken of openly, save in veiled or poetic  language, and that no one ever ate food publicly, because it was  considered immoral and immodest to reveal the mysteries of this natural  function. We know what would occur. A considerable proportion of the  community, more especially the more youthful members, possessed by an  instinctive and legitimate curiosity, would concentrate their thoughts on  the subject. They would have so many problems to puzzle over: How often  ought I to eat? What ought I to eat? Is it wrong to eat fruit, which I  like? Ought I to eat grass, which I don't like? Instinct notwithstanding,  we may be quite sure that only a small minority would succeed in eating  reasonably and wholesomely. The sexual secrecy of life is even more  disastrous than such a nutritive secrecy would be; partly because we  expend such a wealth of moral energy in directing or misdirecting it,  partly because the sexual impulse normally develops at the same time as  the intellectual impulse, not in the early years of life, when wholesome  instinctive habits might be formed. And there is always some ignorant and  foolish friend who is prepared still further to muddle things: Eat a meal  every other day! Eat twelve meals a day! Never eat fruit! Always eat  grass! The advice emphatically given in sexual matters is usually not less  absurd than this. When, however, the matter is fully open, the problems of  food are not indeed wholly solved, but everyone is enabled by the  experience of his fellows to reach some sort of situation suited to his  own case. And when the rigid secrecy is once swept away a sane and natural  reticence becomes for the first time possible.    This secrecy has not always been maintained. When the Catholic Church was  at the summit of its power and influence it fully realized the magnitude  of sexual problems and took an active and inquiring interest in all the  details of normal and abnormal sexuality. Even to the present time there  are certain phenomena of the sexual life which have scarcely been  accurately described except in ancient theological treatises. As the type  of such treatises I will mention the great tome of Sanchez, _De  Matrimonio_. Here you will find the whole sexual life of men and women  analyzed in its relationships to sin. Everything is set forth, as clearly  and as concisely as it can be--without morbid prudery on the one hand, or  morbid sentimentality on the other--in the coldest scientific language;  the right course of action is pointed out for all the cases that may  occur, and we are told what is lawful, what a venial sin, what a mortal  sin. Now I do not consider that sexual matters concern the theologian  alone, and I deny altogether that he is competent to deal with them. In  his hands, also, undoubtedly, they sometimes become prurient, as they can  scarcely fail to become on the non-natural and unwholesome basis of  asceticism, and as they with difficulty become in the open-air light of  science. But we are bound to recognize the thoroughness with which the  Catholic theologians dealt with these matters, and, from their own point  of view, indeed, the entire reasonableness; we are bound to recognize the  admirable spirit in which, successfully or not, they sought to approach  them. We need to-day the same spirit and temper applied from a different  standpoint. These things concern everyone; the study of these things  concerns the physiologist, the psychologist, the moralist. We want to get  into possession of the actual facts, and from the investigation of the  facts we want to ascertain what is normal and what is abnormal, from the  point of view of physiology and of psychology. We want to know what is  naturally lawful under the various sexual chances that may befall man, not  as the born child of sin, but as a naturally social animal. What is a  venial sin against nature, what a mortal sin against nature? The answers  are less easy to reach than the theologians' answers generally were, but  we can at least put ourselves in the right attitude; we may succeed in  asking that question which is sometimes even more than the half of  knowledge.    It is perhaps a mistake to show so plainly at the outset that I approach  what may seem only a psychological question not without moral fervour. But  I do not wish any mistake to be made. I regard sex as the central problem  of life. And now that the problem of religion has practically been  settled, and that the problem of labor has at least been placed on a  practical foundation, the question of sex--with the racial questions that  rest on it--stands before the coming generations as the chief problem for  solution. Sex lies at the root of life, and we can never learn to  reverence life until we know how to understand sex.--So, at least, it  seems to me.    Having said so much, I will try to present such results as I have to  record in that cold and dry light through which alone the goal of  knowledge may truly be seen.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.    July, 1897.          PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.      The first edition of this volume was published in 1899, following \"Sexual  Inversion,\" which now forms Volume II. The second edition, issued by the  present publishers and substantially identical with the first edition,  appeared in the following year. Ten years have elapsed since then and this  new edition will be found to reflect the course of that long interval. Not  only is the volume greatly enlarged, but nearly every page has been partly  rewritten. This is mainly due to three causes: Much new literature  required to be taken into account; my own knowledge of the historical and  ethnographic aspects of the sexual impulse has increased; many fresh  illustrative cases of a valuable and instructive character have  accumulated in my hands. It is to these three sources of improvement that  the book owes its greatly revised and enlarged condition, and not to the  need for modifying any of its essential conclusions. These, far from  undergoing any change, have by the new material been greatly strengthened.    It may be added that the General Preface to the whole work, which was  originally published in 1898 at the beginning of \"Sexual Inversion,\" now  finds its proper place at the outset of the present volume.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.    Carbis Bay,    Cornwall, Eng.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      The present volume contains three studies which seem to me to be necessary  _prolegomena_ to that analysis of the sexual instinct which must form the  chief part of an investigation into the psychology"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX, VOLUME II       Sexual Inversion    by    HAVELOCK ELLIS    1927                PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.      It has been remarked by Professor Wilhelm Ostwald that the problem of  homosexuality is a problem left over to us by the Middle Ages, which for  five hundred years dealt with inverts as it dealt with heretics and  witches. To regard the matter thus is to emphasize its social and  humanitarian interest rather than its biological and psychological  significance. It is no doubt this human interest of the question of  inversion, rather than its scientific importance, great as the latter is,  which is mainly responsible for the remarkable activity with which the  study of homosexuality has been carried on during recent years.    The result has been that, during the fourteen years that have passed since  the last edition of this _Study_ was issued, so vast an amount of work has  been carried on in this field that the preparation of a new edition of the  book has been a long and serious task. Nearly every page has been  rewritten or enlarged and the Index of Authors consulted has more than  doubled in length. The original portions of the book have been still more  changed; sixteen new Histories have been added, selected from others in my  possession as being varied, typical, and full.    These extensive additions to the volume have rendered necessary various  omissions. Many of the shorter and less instructive Histories contained in  earlier editions have been omitted, as well as three Appendices which no  longer seem of sufficient interest to retain. In order to avoid undue  increase in the size of this volume, already much larger than in the  previous editions, a new Study of Eonism, or sexo-esthetic inversion, will  be inserted in vol. v, where it will perhaps be at least as much in place  as here.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.          PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.      It was not my intention to publish a study of an abnormal manifestation of  the sexual instinct before discussing its normal manifestations. It has  happened, however, that this part of my work is ready first, and, since I  thus gain a longer period to develop the central part of my subject, I do  not regret the change of plan.    I had not at first proposed to devote a whole volume to sexual inversion.  It may even be that I was inclined to slur it over as an unpleasant  subject, and one that it was not wise to enlarge on. But I found in time  that several persons for whom I felt respect and admiration were the  congenital subjects of this abnormality. At the same time I realized that  in England, more than in any other country, the law and public opinion  combine to place a heavy penal burden and a severe social stigma on the  manifestations of an instinct which to those persons who possess it  frequently appears natural and normal. It was clear, therefore, that the  matter was in special need of elucidation and discussion.    There can be no doubt that a peculiar amount of ignorance exists regarding  the subject of sexual inversion. I know medical men of many years' general  experience who have never, to their knowledge, come across a single case.  We may remember, indeed, that some fifteen years ago the total number of  cases recorded in scientific literature scarcely equaled those of British  race which I have obtained, and that before my first cases were published  not a single British case, unconnected with the asylum or the prison, had  ever been recorded. Probably not a very large number of people are even  aware that the turning in of the sexual instinct toward persons of the  same sex can ever be regarded as inborn, so far as any sexual instinct is  inborn. And very few, indeed, would not be surprised if it were possible  to publish a list of the names of sexually inverted men and women who at  the present time are honorably known in church, state, society, art, or  letters. It could not be positively affirmed of all such persons that they  were born inverted, but in most the inverted tendency seems to be  instinctive, and appears at a somewhat early age. In any case, however, it  must be realized that in this volume we are not dealing with subjects  belonging to the lunatic asylum, or the prison. We are concerned with  individuals who live in freedom, some of them suffering intensely from  their abnormal organization, but otherwise ordinary members of society. In  a few cases we are concerned with individuals whose moral or artistic  ideals have widely influenced their fellows, who know nothing of the  peculiar organization which has largely molded those ideals.    I am indebted to several friends for notes, observations, and  correspondence on this subject, more especially to one, referred to as  \"Z.,\" and to another as \"Q.,\" who have obtained a considerable number of  reliable histories for me, and have also supplied many valuable notes; to  \"Josiah Flynt\" (whose articles on tramps in _Atlantic Monthly_ and  _Harper's Magazine_ have attracted wide attention) for an appendix on  homosexuality among tramps; to Drs. Kiernan, Lydston, and Talbot for  assistance at various points noted in the text; and to Dr. K., an American  woman physician, who kindly assisted me in obtaining cases, and has also  supplied an appendix. Other obligations are mentioned in the text.    All those portions of the book which are of medical or medico-legal  interest, including most of the cases, have appeared during the last three  years in the _Alienist and Neurologist_, the _Journal of Mental Science_,  the _Centralblatt fuer Nervenheilkunde_, the _Medico-legal Journal_, and  the _Archivo delle Psicopatie Sessuale_. The cases, as they appear in the  present volume, have been slightly condensed, but nothing of genuine  psychological interest has been omitted. Owing to some delay in the  publication of the English edition of the work, a German translation by my  friend, Dr. Hans Kurella, editor of the _Centralblatt fuer  Nervenheilkunde_, has already appeared (1896) in the _Bibliothek fuer  Sozialwissenschaft_. The German edition contains some matter which has  finally been rejected from the English edition as of minor importance; on  the other hand, much has been added to the English edition, and the whole  carefully revised.    I have only to add that if it may seem that I have unduly ignored the  cases and arguments brought forward by other writers, it is by no means  because I wish to depreciate the valuable work done by my predecessors in  this field. It is solely because I have not desired to popularize the  results previously reached, but simply to bring forward my own results. If  I had not been able to present new facts in what is perhaps a new light, I  should not feel justified in approaching the subject of sexual inversion  at all.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.
