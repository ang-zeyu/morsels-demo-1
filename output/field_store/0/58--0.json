[Illustration: UNITED SERVICE CLUB-HOUSE.]      UNITED SERVICE CLUB-HOUSE      Modern club-houses are, for the most part, splendid specimens of the  style which luxury and good-living have attained in this country.  Such are their internal recommendations; but to the public they are  interesting for the architectural embellishment which they add to the  streets of the metropolis. If we reason on Bishop Berkeley's theory--that  all the mansions, equipages, &c. we see abroad, are intended for our  gratification--we must soon forget the turtle, venison, and claret  that are stored in the larders and cellars of club-houses, whilst  our admiration is awakened at the taste which is lavished on their  exteriors.    The \"United Service\" Club-House is, as its name implies, intended for  the Officers of the Army and Navy, who, in these pacific times, may here  enjoy _otium cum dignitate_, and fill up the intervals of refection, in  reading the \"history of the war,\" from the noble quarto to the last  dispatches received at the Foreign Office.    The above Club-House, which occupies an angle of Charles-street and  Regent-street, is, however, but a meagre specimen of the abilities of  the architect, Mr. Smirke. It has none of the characteristic decorations  of either service, if we except the bas-relief on the entrance-front in  Charles street, which represents Britannia distributing laurels to her  brave sons by land and sea. The architecture of the whole is cold and  unfeeling, and even the columns supporting the porticoes are of a very  rigid order--when we consider that the clubhouse is not an official  establishment, but one intended for luxurious accommodation, and that it  would have admitted of much more florid embellishment. At the same time,  although we quarrel with the frigidity of the exterior, we do not  question the warmth of its kitchens, or the potency of its cellars;  neither do we affect any knowledge of the latter--nay, not even enough  to weave into a \"fashionable\" novel.    A new mansion is building for the United Service Club, on the site of  Carlton House, under the superintendance of Mr. Nash, and which, with  another new clubhouse for the Athaenaeum, will form an entrance to the  new square opposite Waterloo-Place. The taste of the sword and pen does  not, however, agree, and their buildings are dissimilar. In the United  Service Club are two rooms of 150 feet by 50, the floors of which are  constructed of cast-iron girders. At the back of these club-houses will  be a large ornamental garden.           *       *       *       *       *      FUNERAL GARLANDS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The primitive Christians censured a practice prevalent among the Romans,  of decorating a corpse, previous to interment or combustion, with  garlands and flowers. Their reprehension extended also to a periodical  custom of placing the \"first-fruits of Flora\" on their graves and tombs.  Thus Anchises, in Dryden's Virgil,_Aeneid,_ book 6, says,      \"Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,    Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;    Let me with _funeral flowers_ his body strew--    This gift, which parents to their children owe,    This unavailing gift I may bestow.\"    Notwithstanding the anathemas of the church, these simple, interesting,  and harmless (if not laudable) practices still remain. The early customs  and features of all nations approximate; and whether the following  traits, which a friend has kindly obliged me with, are relics of Roman  introduction, or national, I leave the antiquary to decide.    On Palm Sunday, in several villages in South Wales, a custom prevails  of cleaning the grave-stones of departed friends and acquaintances, and  ornamenting them with flowers, &c. On the Saturday preceding, a troop of  servant girls go to the churchyard with pails and brushes, to renovate  the various mementos of affection, clean the letters, and take away  the weeds. The next morning their young mistresses attend, with the  gracefulness of innocence in their countenances, and the roses of health  and beauty blooming on their cheeks. According to their fancy, and  according to the state of the season, they place on the stones  snow-drops, crocuses, lilies of the valley, and roses.    A sacrifice such as this, so pure, so innocent, so expressive, is surely  acceptable to the great God of nature.    QUAESITOR.    To our Correspondent's communication, which is worthy of record, from  its originality, we could add many well-authenticated accounts of the  rite of decorating graves, &c. There is in our drawer an interesting  paper on the subject; but we give _Quaesitor_ the priority.           *       *       *       *       *      THE SPIDER'S WEB.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      To the curious among the perusers of the Mirror, it may not be  uninteresting to know that a beautiful impression may be taken on paper  of the reticulated web of the _field-spider_, by sprinkling it finely  with any dark-coloured liquid, and placing the paper intended for the  impression behind the web, and drawing it gently towards you. I do not  know of what ingredients bookbinders' blue-sprinkle is made, but it seems  to absorb the gelatinous matter of which the web is composed. The idea  that an impression might be produced in this manner, was suggested to me  by observing the dew on the web in the morning.    _Rugby_. W.I.T.    Our ingenious Correspondent has, on the fly-leaf of his letter, furnished  us with the impression of a web, as a proof of the practicability of the  above.           *       *       *       *       *      ATAR GUL.    (_For the Mirror_.)      Who hath not inhaled with ecstasy the delicious, the heavenly odour of  \"the Atar Gul, more precious than gold?\" Who hath not in fancy wandered,  as he inspired it, to the terrestrial paradise from whence it is  procured? And who that knew not how so volatile an essence was collected,  hath not marvelled, over the enjoyment of Otto of Roses? Persia, Turkey,  and Egypt, are the principal countries in which it is manufactured, and  the Atar of Persia is generally allowed to be the most superior, and the  most difficult to be obtained genuine. The rose of Cashmire is proverbial  throughout the east for its brilliancy and fragrance; and \"the Roses of  the Jinan Nile, or Garden of the Nile, (attached to the Emperor of  Morocco's palace) are unequalled; mattresses are made of their leaves for  the men of rank to recline upon.\" I transcribe from a published account  in my possession, the method of obtaining Atar Gul in the _east_ (for  I have heard that some _English_ chemists have endeavoured to procure  it from _English_ roses.) merely begging to observe that it exactly  corresponds with that given to me by a gentleman who had witnessed the  process in Egypt.    \"_Otto of Roses_.--The usual method of making it is, to gather the roses  with their calyces, and put them into a still with nearly double their  weight of pure spring water; which, when sufficiently distilled, will be  highly scented with roses; this is then poured into shallow vessels and  exposed to the nocturnal air. Next morning, the _Atar, or essential oil_  of the flowers is found swimming in small congealed particles on the  surface of the water; it is carefully collected and preserved in small  glass bottles.\"[1] A hundred pounds of the flowers scarcely afford in  India two drachms of essential oil. \"Cent livres de petales de Roses,\"  says a French chemist, \"N'en fournissent par la distillation que  _quatre_ drachmes.\" Tachenius from the same quantity obtained half  an ounce, and Hoffman a much larger proportion. The trials of other  chemists have been attended with various results. It is most difficult  to procure the _genuine_ Otto of Roses, since even in the countries  where it is made, the distillers are tempted to put sandal wood, scented  grasses, and other oily plants into the still with the roses, which  alter their perfume, and debase the value of the Atar; colour is no test  of genuineness; green, amber, and light red or pink. The hues of the  _real_ otto, are also those of the adulterated; the presence of the  sandal wood may be detected by the simple sense of smelling; but in  order to discover the union of a grosser oil with the _essential_, drop  a very little otto on a piece of clean writing paper, and hold it to the  fire; if the article is _genuine_, it will evaporate without leaving  a mark on the paper, so ethereal is the _essential oil of roses!_ if  otherwise, a grease-spot will declare the imposition. I need scarcely  expatiate upon the delicate and long-continuing fragrance which this  luxuriant perfume imparts to all things with which it comes in contact;  it is peculiarly calculated for the drawer, writing-desk, &c. since its  aroma is totally unmingled with that most disagreeable effluvium, which  is ever proceeding from alcohol. Lavender-water, _esprit_ de rose &c.  &c. are quite disgusting shut up in box or drawer, but the Atar Gul, is  as delightful there as in the most open and airy space. Some persons  there are, however, who have an antipathy to it, and others will, as  they inhale its delicious odour, fancy with myself, what may be.      THE SONG OF THE ATAR GUL!      I'm come! I'm come! for you've charm'd me here    _Soul of the Rose_, from divine Cashmire    I'm come,--all orient, odorous, rare,    An Eden-breath in your boreal air;      I'm come. I'm come! like a seraph's sigh    Breath'd to ethereal minstrelsy,    And well ye'll deem what a sigh must be    From the tearless heirs of eternity!      I've fled my bright frame from Tirnagh's stream,    And, wand'ring here, am sweet as the dream    Of passion, which stirs the Peri's breast,    Whom her dear one's winglets fan to rest;    I've dwelt i' the rose-cup, and drunk the tone--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11282"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Richmond Palace    [Illustration: Richmond Palace]    Richmond has comparatively but few antiquarian or poetical visiters,  notwithstanding all its associations with the ancient splendour of the  English court, and the hallowed names of Pope and Thomson. Maurice sings,      To thy sequester'd bow'rs and wooded height,    That ever yield my soul renew'd delight,    Richmond, I fly! with all thy beauties fir'd,    By raptur'd poets sung, by kings admir'd!    but ninety-nine out of a hundred who visit Richmond, thank the gods they  are not poetical, fly off to the _Star and Garter_ hill, and content  themselves with the inspirations of its well-stored cellars. All this  corresponds with the turtle-feasting celebrity of the modern _Sheen_; but  it ill accords with the antiquarian importance and resplendent scenery of  this delightful country.    Our engraving is from a very old drawing, representing the palace at  Richmond, as built by Henry VII. The manor-house at Sheen, a little east  of the bridge, and close by the river side, became a _royal palace_ in  the time of Edward I., for he and his successor resided here. Edward III.  died here in 1377. Queen Anne, the consort of his successor, died here in  1394. Deeply affected at her death, he, according to Holinshed, \"caused  it to be thrown down and defaced; whereas the former kings of this land,  being wearie of the citie, used customarily thither to resort as to a  place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recreation.\" Henry V.,  however, restored the palace to its former magnificence; and Henry VII.  held, in 1492, a grand tournament here. In 1499, it was almost consumed  by fire, when Henry rebuilt the palace, and gave it the name of RICHMOND.  Cardinal Wolsey frequently resided here; and Hall, in his Chronicles,  says, that \"when the common people, and especially such as had been  servants of Henry VII., saw the cardinal keep house in the manor royal at  Richmond, which that monarch so highly esteemed, it was a marvel to hear  how they grudged, saying, 'so a butcher's dogge doth lie in the manor of  Richmond!'\"[1]    Queen Elizabeth was prisoner at Richmond during the reign of her sister  Mary; after she came to the throne, the palace was her favourite  residence; and here she died in 1608. Charles I. formed a large  collection of pictures here; and Charles II. was educated at Richmond. On  the restoration, the palace was in a very dismantled state, and having,  during the commonwealth, been plundered and defaced, it never recovered  its pristine splendour.    The survey taken by order of parliament in 1649, affords a minute  description of the palace. The great hall was one hundred feet in length,  and forty in breadth, having a screen at the lower end, over which was  \"fayr foot space in the higher end thereof, the pavement of square tile,  well lighted and seated; at the north end having a turret, or clock-case,  covered with lead, which is a special ornament to this building.\" The  prince's lodgings are described as a \"freestone building, three stories  high, with _fourteen turrets_ covered with lead,\" being \"a very graceful  ornament to the whole house, and perspicuous to the county round about.\"  A round tower is mentioned, called the \"Canted Tower,\" with a staircase  of one hundred and twenty-four steps. The chapel was ninety-six feet long  and forty broad, with cathedral-seats and pews. Adjoining the prince's  garden was an open gallery, two hundred feet long, over which was a close  gallery of similar length. Here was also a royal library. Three pipes  supplied the palace with water, one from the white conduit in the new  park, another from the conduit in the town fields, and the third from a  conduit near the alms-houses in Richmond. In 1650, it was sold for  10,000_l_. to private persons.    All the accounts which have come down to us describe the furniture and  decorations of the ANCIENT PALACE as very superb, exhibiting in gorgeous  tapestry the deeds of kings and of heroes who had signalized themselves  by their conquests throughout France in behalf of their country.    The site of Richmond Palace is now occupied by noble mansions; but AN OLD  ARCHWAY, seen from _the Green_, still remains as a melancholy memorial of  its regal splendour.      [1] Mrs. A.T. Thomson, in her _Memoirs of the Court of Henry the Eighth_,      says, \"On the night of the Epiphany (1510), a pageant was introduced      into the hall at Richmond, representing a hill studded with gold and      precious stones, and having on its summit a tree of gold, from which      hung roses and pomegranates. From the declivity of the hill descended      a lady richly attired, who, with the gentlemen, or, as they were then      called, children of honour, danced a morris before the king. On      another occasion, in the presence of the court, an artificial forest      was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of which were      richly embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were harnessed      with chains of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. In      the midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded      tower, at the end of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a      garland of roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which      succeeded the pageant!\"           *       *       *       *       *      EPITOME OF COMETS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      \"Hast thou ne'er seen the Comet's flaming flight?\"    YOUNG.      Comets, according to Sir Isaac Newton, are compact, solid, fixed, and  durable bodies: in one word, a kind of planets, which move in very  oblique orbits, every way, with the greatest freedom, persevering in  their motions even against the course and direction of the planets; and  their tail is a very thin, slender vapour, emitted by the head, or  nucleus of the comet, ignited or heated by the sun.    There are _bearded_, _tailed_, and _hairy_ comets; thus, when the comet is  eastward of the sun, and moves from it, it is said to be _bearded_,  because the light precedes it in the manner of a beard. When the comet is  westward of the sun, and sets after it, it is said to be _tailed_,  because the train follows it in the manner of a tail. Lastly, when the  comet and the sun are diametrically opposite (the earth being between  them) the train is hid behind the body of the comet, excepting a little  that appears around it in the form of a border of hair, or _coma_, it is  called _hairy_, and whence the name of comet is derived.    For the conservation of the water and moisture of the planets, comets  (says Sir Isaac Newton) seem absolutely requisite; from whose condensed  vapours and exhalations all that moisture which is spent on vegetations  and putrefactions, and turned into dry earth, may be resupplied and  recruited; for all vegetables increase wholly from fluids, and turn by  putrefaction into earth. Hence the quantity of dry earth must continually  increase, and the moisture of the globe decrease, and at last be quite  evaporated, if it have not a continual supply. And I suspect (adds Sir  Isaac) that the spirit which makes the finest, subtilest, and best part  of our air, and which is absolutely requisite for the life and being of  all things, comes principally from the comets.    Another use which he conjectures comets may be designed to serve, is that  of recruiting the sun with fresh fuel, and repairing the consumption of  his light by the streams continually sent forth in every direction from  that luminary--      \"From his huge vapouring train perhaps to shake    Reviving moisture on the numerous orbs,    Thro' which his long ellipsis winds; perhaps    To lend new fuel to declining suns,    To light up worlds, and feed th' ethereal fire.\"    THOMSON.    Newton has computed that the sun's heat in the comet of 1680,[2] was, to  his heat with us at Midsummer, as twenty-eight thousand to one; and that  the heat of the body of the comet was near two thousand times as great as  that of red-hot iron. The same great author also calculates, that a globe  of red-hot iron, of the dimensions of our earth, would scarce be cool in  fifty thousand years. If then the comet be supposed to cool a hundred  times as fast as red-hot iron, yet, since its heat was two thousand times  greater, supposing it of the bigness of the earth, it would not be cool  in a million of years.    An elegant writer in the Guardian, says, \"I cannot forbear reflecting on  the insignificance of human art, when set in comparison with the designs  of Providence. In pursuit of this thought, I considered a comet, or in  the language of the vulgar, a blazing star, as a sky-rocket discharged by  a hand that is Almighty. Many of my readers saw that in the year 1680,  and if they were not mathematicians, will be amazed to hear, that it  travelled with a much greater degree of swiftness than a cannon ball, and  drew after it a tail of fire that was fourscore millions of miles in  length. What an amazing thought is it to consider this stupendous body  traversing the immensity of the creation with such a rapidity; and at the  same time wheeling about in that line which the Almighty had prescribed  for it! That it should move in such inconceivable fury and combustion,  and at the same time with such an exact regularity! How spacious must the  universe be, that gives such bodies as these their full play, without  suffering the least disorder or confusion by it. What a glorious show are  those beings entertained with, that can look into this great theatre of  nature, and see myriads of such tremendous objects wandering through  those immeasurable depths of ether, and running their appointed courses!  Our eyes may hereafter be strong enough to command the magnificent  prospect, and our understandings able to find out the several uses"]]]
