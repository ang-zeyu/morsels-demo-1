JAMES WOOD    EDITOR OF \"NUTTALL'S STANDARD DICTIONARY\" AND COMPILER OF THE  \"DICTIONARY OF QUOTATIONS\"      _THE SIXTY-FIRST THOUSAND_    1907        PREFACE    \"The NUTTALL ENCYCLOPAEDIA\" is the fruit of a project to provide, in a  concise and condensed form, and at a cheap rate, an epitome of the kind  of information given in the larger Encyclopaedias, such as may prove  sufficient for the ordinary requirements, in that particular, of the  generality of people, and especially of such as have not the means for  purchasing or the leisure for studying the larger.    An Encyclopaedia is now recognised to be as indispensable a book of  reference as a dictionary; for while the latter explains and defines the  vehicle of _thought_, the former seeks to define the subject-matter. Now  the rapid increase in the vocabulary of a nation, which makes the  possession of an up-to-date dictionary almost one of the necessaries of  life, is evidently due to the vast increase in the number of _facts_  which the language has to describe or interpret; and if it is difficult  to keep pace with the growth in the language, it is obviously more  difficult to attain even a working knowledge of the array of facts which  in this age come before us for discussion. No man can now peruse even a  daily newspaper without being brought face to face with details about  questions of the deepest interest to _him_; and he is often unable to  grasp the meaning of what he reads for want of additional knowledge or  explanation. In short, it becomes more and more a necessity of modern  life to know something of everything. A little knowledge is not dangerous  to those who recognise it to be little, and it may be sufficient to  enable those who possess it to understand and enjoy intelligently what  would otherwise only weigh as a burdensome reflection upon their  ignorance. Even a comparatively exhaustive treatment of the multitudinous  subjects comprehended under the term universal knowledge would demand a  library of large volumes, hence the extent and heavy cost of the great  Encyclopaedias. But it is doubtful whether the mass of information  contained in those admirable and bulky works does not either go beyond,  or, more frequently than not, fall short of the requirements of those who  refer to them. For the special student there is too little, for the  general reader too much. Detailed knowledge of any subject in this age of  specialisation can be acquired only by study of the works specifically  devoted to it. What is wanted in a popular Encyclopaedia is succinct  information--the more succinct the better, so long as it gives what is  required by the inquiry, leaving it to the authorities in each subject to  supply the information desired by those intent on pursuing it further.  The value of an Encyclopaedia of such small scope must depend, therefore,  upon the careful selection of its materials, and in this respect it is  hoped the one now offered to the public will be found adequate to any  reasonable demands made upon it. If the facts given here are the facts  that the great majority are in search of when they refer to its pages, it  may be claimed for \"The Nuttall Encyclopaedia\" that, in one respect at all  events it is more valuable for instant reference than the best  Encyclopaedia in many volumes; for \"The Nuttall\" can lie on the desk for  ready-to-hand reference, and yields at a glance the information wanted.    Within the necessary limits of a single volume the Editor persuades  himself he has succeeded in including a wide range of subjects, and he  trusts that the information he has given on these will meet in some  measure at least the wants of those for whom the book has been compiled.  To the careful Newspaper Reader; to Heads of Families, with children at  school, whose persistent questions have often to go without an answer; to  the Schoolmaster and Tutor; to the student with a shallow purse; to the  Busy Man and Man of Business, it is believed that this volume will prove  a solid help.    The subjects, as hinted, are various, and these the Editor may be  permitted to classify in a general way under something like the following  rubrics:--    1. Noted people, their nationality, the time when they flourished, and  what they are noted for.    2. Epochs, important movements, and events in history, with the dates and  their historical significance.    3. Countries, provinces, and towns, with descriptions of them, their  sizes, populations, etc., and what they are noted for.    4. Heavenly bodies, especially those connected with the solar system,  their sizes, distances, and revolutions.    5. Races and tribes of mankind, with features that characterise them.    6. Mythologies, and the account they severally give of the divine and  demonic powers, supreme and subordinate, that rule the world.    7. Religions of the world, with their respective credos and objects and  forms of worship.    8. Schools of philosophy, with their theories of things and of the  problems of life and human destiny.    9. Sects and parties, under the different systems of belief or polity,  and the specialities of creed and policy that divide them.    10. Books of the world, especially the sacred ones, and the spiritual  import of them; in particular those of the Bible, on each of which a note  or two is given.    11. Legends and fables, especially such as are more or less of world  significance.    12. Characters in fiction and fable, both mediaeval and modern.    13. Fraternities, religious and other, with their symbols and  shibboleths.    14. Families of note, especially such as have developed into dynasties.    15. Institutions for behoof of some special interest, secular or sacred,  including universities.    16. Holidays and festivals, with what they commemorate, and the rites and  ceremonies connected with them.    17. Science, literature, and art in general, but these chiefly in  connection with the names of those distinguished in the cultivation of  them.    Such, in a general way, are some of the subjects contained in the book,  while there is a number of others not reducible to the classification  given, and among these the Editor has included certain subjects of which  he was able to give only a brief definition, just as there are doubtless  others which in so wide an area of research have escaped observation and  are not included in the list. In the selection of subjects the Editor  experienced not a little embarrassment, and he was not unfrequently at a  loss to summarise particulars under several of the heads. Such as it is,  the Editor offers the book to the public, and he hopes that with all its  shortcomings it will not be unfavourably received.          NOTES.

It is the direct successor to the  \"Aunt Babette Cook Book,\" which has enjoyed undisputed popularity for  more than a generation and which is no longer published. _The  International Jewish Cook Book_ is, however, far superior to the older  book. It is much larger and the recipes are prepared strictly in  accordance with the Jewish dietary laws.    The author and compiler, Mrs. Florence K. Greenbaum, is a household  efficiency woman, an expert Jewish cook, and thoroughly understands the  scientific combining of foods. She is a graduate of Hunter College of  New York City, where she made a special study of diet and the chemistry  of foods. She was Instructor in Cooking and Domestic Science in the  Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York, and is now Instructor and  Lecturer for the Association of Jewish Home Makers and the Central  Jewish Institute, both under the auspices of the Bureau of Jewish  Education (Kehillah).    Mrs. Greenbaum knows the housewife's problems through years of personal  experience, and knows also how to economize. Many of these recipes have  been used in her household for three generations and are still used  daily in her home. There is no one better qualified to write a Jewish  Cook Book than she.    Suggestions and additional recipes, for inclusion in later editions of  the book, will be gratefully accepted by    THE PUBLISHERS. _New York, February, 1918_.            *PREFACE*      In compiling these recipes every effort has been made to bear in mind  the resources of the Jewish kitchen, as well as the need of being  economical and practical.    The aim throughout has been to lay special emphasis on those dishes  which are characteristically Jewish--those time-honored recipes which  have been handed down the generations by Jewish housewives (for the  Sabbath, Passover, etc). But the book contains a great many other  recipes besides these, for the Jewish cook is glad to learn from her  neighbors. Here will be found the favorite recipes of Germany, Hungary,  Austria, France, Russia, Poland, Roumania, etc.; also hundreds of  recipes used in the American household. In fact, the book contains  recipes of every kind of food appealing to the Jewish taste, which the  Jewish housewife has been able to adapt to the dietary laws, thus making  the Cook Book truly _International_.    The manner of presentation is clear and simple, and if directions are  followed carefully, will insure success to the inexperienced housewife.  For the book has been largely planned to assist her in preparing  wholesome, attractive meals; to serve the simplest as well as the most  elaborate repast--from appetizer to dessert--without transgressing the  dietary laws. At the same time the book offers many valuable suggestions  and hints to the most expert cook.    In this book are also directions for making meat substitutes and many  economies of the hour, which have been added to meet the needs of the  present day.          *REMARKS*      The Jewish housewife enjoys the enviable reputation of being a good  cook; in fact she is quite famous for her savory and varied dishes. Her  skill is due not so much to a different method of cooking as to her  ingenuity in combining food materials. The very cuts of meat she has  been always accustomed to use, are those which modern cooks are now  advising all to use. The use of vegetables with just enough meat to  flavor, as for instance in the Shabbos Shalet, is now being highly  recommended.    While it is not given to each and every woman to be a good cook, she can  easily acquire some knowledge of the principles of cooking, namely:    1. That heat from coal, charcoal, wood, gas or electricity is used as a  medium for toasting, broiling or roasting.    2. That heat from water is used as a medium for boiling, simmering,  stewing or steaming.    3. That heat from fat is used as a medium for deep fat frying.    4. That heat from heated surfaces is used in pan-broiling, saute,  baking, braising or pot-roasting.    The length of time required to cook different articles varies with the  size and weight of same--and here is where the judgment of the housewife  counts. She must understand how to keep the fire at the proper  temperature, and how to manage the range or stove.    In planning meals try to avoid monotony; do not have the same foods for  the same days each week. Try new and unknown dishes by way of variety.  Pay attention to garnishing, thereby making the dishes attractive to the  eye as well as to the palate.    The recipes in this book are planned for a family of five, but in some  instances desserts, puddings and vegetables may be used for two meals.  Cakes are good for several days.    Do not consider the use of eggs, milk and cream an extravagance where  required for certain desserts or sauces for vegetables, as their use  adds to the actual food value of the dish.    As a rule the typical Jewish dish contains a large proportion of fat  which when combined with cereal or vegetable fruits, nuts, sugar or  honey, forms a dish supplying all the nourishment required for a  well-balanced meal. Many of these dishes, when combined with meat,  require but a small proportion of same.    Wherever fat is called for, it is intended that melted fat or dripping  be used. In many of the dishes where fat is required for frying, any of  the good vegetable oils or butter substitutes may be used equally well.  These substitutes may also be used in place of butter or fat when same  is required as an ingredient for the dish itself. In such cases less fat  must be used, and more salt added. It is well to follow the directions  given on the containers of such substitutes.    It is understood that all meats be made _kosher_.    Before preparing any dish, gather all materials, and see that all the  ingredients are at hand.          *RULES FOR KASHERING*      In the religious and dietary laws of the Jewish people, the term  \"kasher\" is applied to the preparation of meat and poultry, and means  \"to render fit\" or \"proper\" for eating.    1. To render meat \"fit\" for food, the animal must be killed and cut up  according to the Jewish method of slaughter, and must be purchased from  a Jewish butcher.    2. The meat should be put into a pan, especially reserved for this  purpose, entirely covered with cold water, and left to soak for half an  hour. Before removing the meat from the water every particle of blood  must be washed off. It should then be put upon the salting board (a  smooth wooden board), placed in a slanting position, or upon a board  with numerous perforations, in order to allow the blood to freely flow  down. The meat should then be profusely sprinkled on all sides with  salt, and allowed to remain in salt for one hour. It is then removed,  held over a sink or pan, and well rinsed with cold water three times, so  that all the salt is washed off. Meat left for three days or more  unsoaked and unsalted, may be used only for broiling over coals; it may  not be cooked in any other way.    The ends of the hoofs and the claws of poultry must be cut off before  the feet are _kashered_.    Bones with no meat or fat adhering to them must be soaked separately,  and during the salting should not be placed near the meat.    3. The liver must be prepared apart from the meat. It must be cut open  in both directions, washed in cold water, and broiled over the fire, and  salted while it is broiling. It should be seared on all sides. Water  must then be poured over it, to wash the blood away. It may then be used  in any manner, as the heat has drawn out the blood. Small steaks and  chops may be _kashered_ in the same way.    4. The heart must be cut open, lengthwise, and the tip removed before  being soaked, so that the blood may flow out. The lungs likewise must be  cut open before being soaked. Milt must have veins removed.    5. The head and feet may be _kashered_ with the hair or skin adhering  to them. The head should, however, be cut open, the brain taken out, and  _kashered_ separately.    6. To _kasher_ suet or fat for clarifying, remove skin, and proceed as  with meat.    7. Joints from hind-quarters must not be used, until they have been  \"porged,\" which means that all veins of blood, forbidden fat, and  prohibited sinew have been removed. In New York City no hind-quarter  meat is used by orthodox Jews.    8. All poultry must be drawn, and the inside removed before putting in  water.    Cut the head off and cut the skin along the neck; find the vein which  lies between the tendons, and trace it as far back as possible; at the  back of the neck it divides into two branches, and these must be  removed.    Cut off the tips of the wings and the claws of the feet. Proceed as with  meat, first cutting open the heart and the liver. Eggs found inside of  poultry, with or without shells, must be soaked and when salted be  placed in such a position that the blood from the meat does not flow  upon them. Such eggs may not be eaten with milk foods.    In conducting a kosher kitchen care must be taken not to mix meat and  milk, or meat and butter at the same meal.    The "]]]
