Indeed, a woman's pen  alone can describe half that is requisite to be told of the internal  management of a domicile in the backwoods, in order to enable the  outcoming female emigrant to form a proper judgment of the trials and  arduous duties she has to encounter.    \"Forewarned, forearmed,\" is a maxim of our forefathers, containing much  matter in its pithy brevity; and, following its spirit, the writer of  the following pages has endeavoured to afford every possible information  to the wives and daughters of emigrants of the higher class who  contemplate seeking a home amid our Canadian wilds. [Illustration:  Peter, the Chief] Truth has been conscientiously her object in the work,  for it were cruel to write in flattering terms calculated to deceive  emigrants into the belief that the land to which they are transferring  their families, their capital, and their hopes, a land flowing with milk  and honey, where comforts and affluence may be obtained with little  exertion. She prefers honestly representing facts in their real and true  light, that the female part of the emigrant's family may be enabled to  look them firmly in the face; to find a remedy in female ingenuity and  expediency for some difficulties; and, by being properly prepared,  encounter the rest with that high-spirited cheerfulness of which well-  educated females often give extraordinary proofs. She likewise wishes to  teach them to discard every thing exclusively pertaining to the  artificial refinement of fashionable life in England; and to point out  that, by devoting the money consumed in these incumbrances to articles  of real use, which cannot be readily obtained in Canada, they may enjoy  the pleasure of superintending a pleasant, well-ordered home. She is  desirous of giving them the advantage of her three years' experience,  that they may properly apply every part of their time, and learn to  consider that every pound or pound's worth belonging to any member of an  out-coming emigrant's family, ought to be sacredly considered as  _capital_, which must make proper returns either as the means of  bringing increase in the shape of income, or, what is still better, in  healthful domestic comfort.    These exhalations in behalf of utility in preference to artificial  personal refinement, are not so needless as the English public may  consider. The emigrants to British America are no longer of the rank of  life that formerly left the shores of the British Isles. It is not only  the poor husbandmen and artisans, that move in vast bodies to the west,  but it is the enterprising English capitalist, and the once affluent  landholder, alarmed at the difficulties of establishing numerous  families in independence, in a country where every profession is  overstocked, that join the bands that Great Britain is pouring forth  into these colonies! Of what vital importance is it that the female  members of these most valuable colonists should obtain proper  information regarding the important duties they are undertaking; that  they should learn beforehand to brace their minds to the task, and thus  avoid the repinings and discontent that is apt to follow unfounded  expectations and fallacious hopes!    It is a fact not universally known to the public, that British officers  and their families are usually denizens of the backwoods; and as great  numbers of unattached officers of every rank have accepted grants of  land in Canada, they are the pioneers of civilization in the wilderness,  and their families, often of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13568"],[0,"Woman Suffrage By Federal Constitutional Amendment (#1)"],[1,"Team.              NATIONAL SUFFRAGE LIBRARY    WOMAN SUFFRAGE BY FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT    COMPILED BY CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT    PUBLISHED BY NATIONAL WOMAN SUFFRAGE PUBLISHING CO., INC. 171 MADISON  AVENUE NEW YORK      1917        THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO    THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE LEGISLATURES OF THE  SEVERAL STATES. IT GOES WITH THE HOPE THAT IT MAY LEAD TO A BETTER  UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS FOR A FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT  PROVIDING THAT NO STATE SHALL DENY THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON ACCOUNT OF  SEX.          INTRODUCTION      No effort is made in the following pages to present an argument for  woman suffrage. No careful observer of the modern trend of human  affairs, doubts that \"governments of the people\" are destined to  replace the monarchies of the world. No listener will fail to hear the  rumble of the rising tide of democracy. No watcher of events will deny  that the women of all civilized lands will be enfranchised eventually  as part of the people entitled to give consent and no American  possessed of political foresight doubts woman suffrage in our land as  a coming fact.    The discussion herein is strictly confined to the reasons why an  amendment to the Federal Constitution is the most appropriate method  of dealing with the question. This proposed amendment was introduced  into Congress in 1878 at the request of the National Woman Suffrage  Association. Since 1882 the Senate Committee has reported it with a  favorable majority every year except in 1890 and 1896. Twice only has  it gone to vote in the Senate. The first time was on January 25, 1887;  the second, March 19, 1914. In the House it has been reported from  Committee seven times, twice by a favorable majority, three times by  an adverse majority and twice without recommendation. The House has  allowed the measure to come to vote but once, in 1915. Yet while women  of the nation in large and increasing numbers have stood at doors of  Congress waiting and hoping, praying and appealing for the democratic  right to have their opinions counted in affairs of their government,  millions of men have entered through our gates and automatically have  passed into voting citizenship without cost of money, time or service,  aye, without knowing what it meant or asking for the privilege. Among  the enfranchised there are vast groups of totally illiterate, and  others of gross ignorance, groups of men of all nations of Europe,  uneducated Indians and Negroes. Among the unenfranchised are the  owners of millions of dollars worth of property, college presidents  and college graduates, thousands of teachers in universities, colleges  and public schools, physicians, lawyers, dentists, journalists, heads  of businesses, representatives of every trade and occupation and  thousands of the nation's homekeepers. The former group secured its  vote without the asking; the latter appeals in vain to Congress for  the removal of the stigma this inexplicable contrast puts upon their  sex. It is hoped this little book may gain attention where other means  have failed.      C.C.C.      January, 1917.          TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                         PAGE    CHAPTER I.                                           1    WHY THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT?    By CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT    There are seven reasons for Federal enfranchisement of women.  Other countries have so enfranchised women. Conditions of men's  enfranchisement in U.S. were easy. Many State constitutions today  practically impossible to amend. Election laws do not protect State  amendment elections from fraud. Men's right to vote protected by  Federal Constitution; state by state enfranchisement would not give  this protection to women. Woman Suffrage a national question. Decision  on technical and abstract question of Suffrage demands different class  of intelligence from election of candidates.        CHAPTER II                                            12    STATE CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTRUCTIONS    By MARY SUMNER BOYD    State Suffrage amendments defeated in recent years by technical  difficulties. Ratification by Legislature and People theory of State  Constitutional Amendment. So adopted in South Dakota and Missouri.  In most states technicalities make amending impossible. Classes  of technicalities. Limit to number of amendments. \"Constitutional  majority.\" Passage of two Legislatures. More than majority of the  people required for ratification. Indiana. Time requirements. New  Mexico. Revision by Convention. Some states have no or infrequent  Constitutional Conventions. New Hampshire. Delaware Constitution alone  amended by Legislature or Convention without popular vote. Thirty  states gave foundations male suffrage by this easy means.        CHAPTER III                                          21    ELECTION LAWS AND REFERENDA    By CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT    State Election Laws defective. Many state suffrage amendments  undoubtedly lost by frauds in elections. In twenty-four states  election law or precedents offer no correction of returns in  fraudulent amendment elections. In twenty-three states Contest on  election returns probably possible. In eight states recount of  votes made. A court procedure and expensive. Punishment for bribery.  Relation to Contest. Ohio cases. Vagueness of election laws protects  corruption. Ignorant vote used by corrupt. Form of ballot often helps  corruption. Only 13 states have headless ballots. Form of Suffrage  amendment ballots in recent years aided in defeat of measure.  Examples. Non-partisan referendum not protected from fraud like party  questions. In most states women cannot be watchers at polls. Aliens  can vote in eight states. Illiterate can vote in most states. Resume.        CHAPTER IV                                            36    THE STORY OF THE 1916 REFERENDA    By CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT    Three states voted on Woman Suffrage amendments. Some causes of  failure. Story of Iowa election. Woman's Christian Temperance Union  proves forty-seven varieties of corruption. South Dakota. Foreign  vote defeated Woman Suffrage there. Figures of some counties.  Relation between Prohibition and Woman Suffrage votes. West Virginia.  Illiteracy and conservatism defeated Woman Suffrage there. Liquor  influence felt. Corruption in Berkely County, West Virginia. Special  Legislative session called but investigation of frauds abandoned.  Analysis of vote of certain counties. Resume.        CHAPTER V                                             55    FEDERAL ACTION AND STATES RIGHTS    By HENRY WADE ROGERS    Judge of U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, N.Y.C.    Would Federal Amendment violate local self-government or conflict with  State Rights? States rights a sound doctrine, but has been perverted,  misapplied and carried to extremes. Henry St. George Tucker maintains  this way of gaining woman suffrage is contrary to rightful demarcation  of powers of federal and state governments. Constitutional Convention  1787 provided that amendments be ratified by three-fourths State  Legislatures, State Constitutions may not violate United States  Constitution for this is supreme Law. Amendment to U.S. Constitution  valid regardless of provisions in State Constitutions. Ratification by  State Legislatures does not violate States rights for by it states act  as sovereigns. Same argument for removal of sex line in Suffrage  as that on which 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were based. 15th  amendment gives the sound basis for woman suffrage amendment.        CHAPTER VI                                             69    OBJECTIONS TO THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT By CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT    States Rights objection discussed. U.S. Constitution twice amended  recently under Democratic administration. Federal Prohibition  Amendment introduced by Southern Democrat. Even if all state  constitutions gave woman suffrage U.S. Constitution would contain  discrimination against women in word \"male.\" Objection that woman  suffrage will increase Negro vote. If true, would be objection also  to State suffrage amendment. White supremacy will be strengthened by  woman suffrage. Discussion of figures of Negro and white population  in 15 southern states. Testimony of Chief Justice Walter E. Clark.  Objection that women do not want the vote. Men of 21 and naturalized  citizens become voters without being asked. Only those who wish  to need use the vote. That many women do want the vote is shown  by western figures in election of November, 1916. Objection that  unfavorable referenda in various states show that constituency has  instructed its representatives in Congress against woman suffrage.  Unfavorable majority against a suffrage amendment is in reality a  minority of constituency. Objection on ground of political expediency.  Meaning of this argument as used by different interests. If government  \"by the people\" is expedient, then government by _all_ the people is  expedient. If Government by certain classes is better, then basis of  franchise should, be morality and education, not sex. Objection  that Woman Suffrage will increase corrupt vote. Woman Suffrage will  increase intelligent electorate. Statistics. It will increase  the moral vote. Only one in twenty criminals is a woman. Election  conditions in equal suffrage states. Objection that Prohibition  sentiment is stronger than Suffrage sentiment since former has spread  faster. Prohibition can be established by statute and by local option  and suffrage cannot.          CHAPTER I    WHY THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT?      Woman Suffrage is coming--no intelligent person in the United States  or in the world will deny that fact. The most an intelligent opponent  expects to accomplish is to postpone its establishment as long as  possible. When it will come and how it will come are still open  questions. Woman Suffrage by Federal Amendment is supported by seven  main reasons. These main reasons are evaded "]]]
