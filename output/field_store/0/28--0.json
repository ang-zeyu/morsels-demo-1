CLAUD. EPITH.      THE SECOND EDITION.      LONDON:    PRINTED BY J. NICHOLS,    FOR J. JOHNSON, ST. PAUL'S CHURCH YARD. M, DCC, XC.      ADVERTISEMENT.    The general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination  under the banner of Science, and to lead her votaries from the looser  analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter ones,  which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular design  is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of BOTANY; by  introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science, and  recommending to their attention the immortal works of the Swedish  Naturalist LINNEUS.    In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of Plants  is delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they may be  supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. But the publication of this  part is deferred to another year, for the purpose of repeating some  experiments on vegetation, mentioned in the notes. In the second poem, or  LOVES OF THE PLANTS, which is here presented to the Reader, the Sexual  System of LINNEUS is explained, with the remarkable properties of many  particular plants.    The author has withheld this work, (excepting a few pages) many years  from the press, according to the rule of Horace, hoping to have rendered  it more worthy the acceptance of the public,--but finds at length, that  he is less able, from disuse, to correct the poetry; and, from want of  leizure, to amplify the annotations.    In this second edition, the plants Amaryllis, Orchis, and Cannabis are  inserted with two additional prints of flowers; some alterations are made  in Gloriosa, and Tulipa; and the description of the Salt-mines in Poland  is removed to the first poem on the Economy of Vegetation.        PREFACE.      Linneus has divided the vegetable world into 24 Classes; these Classes  into about 120 Orders; these Orders contain about 2000 Families, or  Genera; and these Families about 20,000 Species; besides the innumerable  Varieties, which the accidents of climate or cultivation have added to  these Species.    The Classes are distinguished from each other in this ingenious system,  by the number, situation, adhesion, or reciprocal proportion of the males  in each flower. The Orders, in many of these Classes, are distinguished  by the number, or other circumstances of the females. The Families, or  Genera, are characterized by the analogy of all the parts of the flower  or fructification. The Species are distinguished by the foliage of the  plant; and the Varieties by any accidental circumstance of colour, taste,  or odour; the seeds of these do not always produce plants similar to the  parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees and garden flowers; which are  propagated by grafts or layers.    The first eleven Classes include the plants, in whose flowers both the  sexes reside; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither united, nor  unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore distinguished from  each other simply by the number of males in each flower, as is seen in  the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire Botanique of M. BULLIARD,  in which the numbers of each division refer to the Botanic Classes.    CLASS I. ONE MALE, _Monandria_; includes the plants which possess but One  Stamen in each flower.    II. TWO MALES, _Diandria_. Two Stamens.    III. THREE MALES, _Triandria_. Three Stamens.    IV. FOUR MALES, _Tetrandria_. Four Stamens.    V. FIVE MALES, _Pentandria_. Five Stamens.    VI. SIX MALES, _Hexandria_. Six Stamens.    VII. SEVEN MALES, _Heptandria_. Seven Stamens.    VIII. EIGHT MALES, _Octandria_. Eight Stamens.    IX. NINE MALES, _Enneandria_. Nine Stamens.    X. TEN MALES, _Decandria_. Ten Stamens.    XI. TWELVE MALES, _Dodecandria_. Twelve Stamens.      The next two Classes are distinguished not only by the number of equal  and disunited males, as in the above eleven Classes, but require an  additional circumstance to be attended to, _viz._ whether the males or  stamens be situated on the calyx, or not.    XII. TWENTY MALES, _Icosandria_. Twenty Stamens inserted on the calyx or  flower-cup; as is well seen in the last Figure of No. xii. in the annexed  Plate.    XIII. MANY MALES, _Polyandria_. From 20 to 100 Stamens, which do not  adhere to the calyx; as is well seen in the first Figure of No. xiii. in  the annexed Plate.      In the next two Classes, not only the number of stamens are to be  observed, but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height.    XIV. TWO POWERS, _Didynamia_. Four Stamens, of which two are lower than  the other two; as is seen in the two first Figures of No. xiv.    XV. FOUR POWERS, _Tetradynamia_. Six Stamens; of which four are taller,  and the two lower ones opposite to each other; as is seen in the third  Figure of the upper row in No. 15.    The five subsequent Classes are distinguished not by the number of the  males, or stamens, but by their union or adhesion, either by their  anthers, or filaments, or to the female or pistil.    XVI. ONE BROTHERHOOD, _Monadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their  filaments into one company; as in the second Figure below of No. xvi.    XVII. TWO BROTHERHOODS, _Diadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their  filaments into two Companies; as in the uppermost Fig. No. xvii.    XVIII. MANY BROTHERHOODS, _Polyadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their  filaments into three or more companies, as in No. xviii.    XIX. CONFEDERATE MALES, _Syngenesia_. Many Stamens united by their  anthers; as in first and second Figures, No. xix.    XX. FEMININE MALES, _Gynandria_. Many Stamens attached to the pistil.      The next three Classes consist of plants, whose flowers contain but one  of the sexes; or if some of them contain both sexes, there are other  flowers accompanying them of but one sex.    XXI. ONE HOUSE, _Monoecia_. Male flowers and female flowers separate, but  on the same plant.    XXII. TWO HOUSES, _Dioecia_. Male flowers and female flowers separate, on  different plants.    XXIII. POLYGAMY, _Polygamia_. Male and female flowers on one or more  plants, which have at the same time flowers of both sexes.      The last Class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible.    XXIV. CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, _Cryptogamia_.    The Orders of the first thirteen Classes are founded on the number  of Females, or Pistils, and distinguished by the names, ONE FEMALE,  _Monogynia_. TWO FEMALES, _Digynia_. THREE FEMALES, _Trigynia_, &c. as is  seen in No. i. which represents a plant of one male, one female; and in  the first Figure of No. xi. which represents a flower with twelve males,  and three females; (for, where the pistils have no apparent styles, the  summits, or stigmas, are to be numbered) and in the first Figure of No.  xii. which represents a flower with twenty males and many females; and in  the last Figure of the same No. which has twenty males and one female;  and in No. xiii. which represents a flower with many males and many  females.    The Class of TWO POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders; into such  as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or flower cup; and  such as have their seeds covered; as is seen in No. xiv. Fig. 3. and 5.    The Class of FOUR POWERS, is divided also into two Orders; in one of  these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule, as in _Shepherd's purse_.  No. xiv. Fig. 5. In the other they are inclosed in a silique, as in  _Wall-flower_. Fig. 4.    In all the other Classes, excepting the Classes Confederate Males, and  Clandestine Marriage, as the character of each Class is distinguished by  the situations of the males; the character of the Orders is marked by the  numbers of them. In the Class ONE BROTHERHOOD, No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order  of ten males is represented. And in the Class TWO BROTHERHOODS, No. xvii.  Fig. 2. the Order ten males is represented.    In the Class CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly distinguished by  the fertility or barrenness of the florets of the disk, or ray of the  compound flower.    And in the Class of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders are termed  FERNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUNGUSSES.    The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are all  natural associations, and are described from the general resemblances of  the parts of fructification, in respect to their number, form, situation,  and reciprocal proportion. These are the Calyx, or Flower-cup, as seen in  No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1. and 3. No. xiv. Fig. 1. 2. 3. 4. Second,  the Corol, or Blossom, as seen in No. i. ii. &c. Third, the Males, or  Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii. Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females,  or Pistils; as in No. i. No. xii. Fig. 1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig.  3. Fifth, the Pericarp or Fruit-vessel; as No. xv. Fig. 4. 5. No. xvii.  Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.    The illustrious author of the Sexual System of Botany, in his preface to  his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniously imagines, that one  plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and that the  intermarriages of these produced one plant of every Genus, or Family; and  that the intermarriages of these Generic, or Family plants, produced all  the Species: and lastly, that the intermarriages of the individuals of  the Species produced the Varieties.    In the following POEM, the name or number of the Class or Order of each  plant is printed in italics; as \"_Two_ brother swains.\" \"_One_ House  contains them.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10707"],[0,"A Christmas Mystery: The Story of Three Wise Men (#1)"],[1,"\"_I cannot tell how the truth may be:  I say the tale as 'twas said to me._\"            BY THE SAME AUTHOR      IDOLS  SEPTIMUS  THE USURPER  THE WHITE DOVE  THE BELOVED VAGABOND  THE DEMAGOGUE AND LADY PHAYRE  THE MORALS OF MARCUS ORDEYNE  AT THE GATE OF SAMARIA  A STUDY IN SHADOWS  SIMON THE JESTER  WHERE LOVE IS  DERELICTS        [Illustration: \"I HEARD IT.

LOCKE    ILLUSTRATED BY BLENDON CAMPBELL      1910          LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS      \"I heard it. I felt it. It was like the beating of wings.\" Frontispiece    \"I told you the place was uncanny.\"    Instinctively they all knelt down.    Carried with them an inalienable joy and possession into the great  world.            A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY        Three men who had gained great fame and honour throughout the world met  unexpectedly in front of the bookstall at Paddington Station. Like most  of the great ones of the earth they were personally acquainted, and they  exchanged surprised greetings.    Sir Angus McCurdie, the eminent physicist, scowled at the two others  beneath his heavy black eyebrows.    \"I'm going to a God-forsaken place in Cornwall called Trehenna,\" said  he.    \"That's odd; so am I,\" croaked Professor Biggleswade. He was a little,  untidy man with round spectacles, a fringe of greyish beard and a weak,  rasping voice, and he knew more of Assyriology than any man, living or  dead. A flippant pupil once remarked that the Professor's face was  furnished with a Babylonic cuneiform in lieu of features.    \"People called Deverill, at Foulis Castle?\" asked Sir Angus.    \"Yes,\" replied Professor Biggleswade.    \"How curious! I am going to the Deverills, too,\" said the third man.    This man was the Right Honourable Viscount Doyne, the renowned Empire  Builder and Administrator, around whose solitary and remote life popular  imagination had woven many legends. He looked at the world through tired  grey eyes, and the heavy, drooping, blonde moustache seemed tired, too,  and had dragged down the tired face into deep furrows. He was smoking a  long black cigar.    \"I suppose we may as well travel down together,\" said Sir Angus, not  very cordially.    Lord Doyne said courteously: \"I have a reserved carriage. The railway  company is always good enough to place one at my disposal. It would give  me great pleasure if you would share it.\"    The invitation was accepted, and the three men crossed the busy, crowded  platform to take their seats in the great express train. A porter, laden  with an incredible load of paraphernalia, trying to make his way through  the press, happened to jostle Sir Angus McCurdie. He rubbed his shoulder  fretfully.    \"Why the whole land should be turned into a bear garden on account of  this exploded superstition of Christmas is one of the anomalies of  modern civilization. Look at this insensate welter of fools travelling  in wild herds to disgusting places merely because it's Christmas!\"    \"You seem to be travelling yourself, McCurdie,\" said Lord Doyne.    \"Yes--and why the devil I'm doing it, I've not the faintest notion,\"  replied Sir Angus.    \"It's going to be a beast of a journey,\" he remarked some moments later,  as the train carried them slowly out of the station. \"The whole country  is under snow--and as far as I can understand we have to change twice  and wind up with a twenty-mile motor drive.\"    He was an iron-faced, beetle-browed, stern man, and this morning he did  not seem to be in the best of tempers. Finding his companions inclined  to be sympathetic, he continued his lamentation.    \"And merely because it's Christmas I've had to shut up my laboratory and  give my young fools a holiday--just when I was in the midst of a most  important series of experiments.\"    Professor Biggleswade, who had heard vaguely of and rather looked down  upon such new-fangled toys as radium and thorium and helium and  argon--for the latest astonishing developments in the theory of  radio-activity had brought Sir Angus McCurdie his world-wide fame--said  somewhat ironically:    \"If the experiments were so important, why didn't you lock yourself up  with your test tubes and electric batteries and finish them alone?\"    \"Man!\" said McCurdie, bending across the carriage, and speaking with a  curious intensity of voice, \"d'ye know I'd give a hundred pounds to be  able to answer that question?\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked the Professor, startled.    \"I should like to know why I'm sitting in this damned train and going to  visit a couple of addle-headed society people whom I'm scarcely  acquainted with, when I might be at home in my own good company  furthering the progress of science.\"    \"I myself,\" said the Professor, \"am not acquainted with them at all.\"    It was Sir Angus McCurdie's turn to look surprised.    \"Then why are you spending Christmas with them?\"    \"I reviewed a ridiculous blank-verse tragedy written by Deverill on the  Death of Sennacherib. Historically it was puerile. I said so in no  measured terms. He wrote a letter claiming to be a poet and not an  archaeologist. I replied that the day had passed when poets could with  impunity commit the abominable crime of distorting history. He retorted  with some futile argument, and we went on exchanging letters, until his  invitation and my acceptance concluded the correspondence.\"    McCurdie, still bending his black brows on him, asked him why he had not  declined. The Professor screwed up his face till it looked more like a  cuneiform than ever. He, too, found the question difficult to answer,  but he showed a bold front.    \"I felt it my duty,\" said he, \"to teach that preposterous ignoramus  something worth knowing about Sennacherib. Besides I am a bachelor and  would sooner spend Christmas, as to whose irritating and meaningless  annoyance I cordially agree with you, among strangers than among my  married sisters' numerous and nerve-racking families.\"    Sir Angus McCurdie, the hard, metallic apostle of radio-activity,  glanced for a moment out of the window at the grey, frost-bitten fields.  Then he said:    \"I'm a widower. My wife died many years ago and, thank God, we had no  children. I generally spend Christmas alone.\"    He looked out of the window again. Professor Biggleswade suddenly  remembered the popular story of the great scientist's antecedents, and  reflected that as McCurdie had once run, a barefoot urchin, through the  Glasgow mud, he was likely to have little kith or kin. He himself envied  McCurdie. He was always praying to be delivered from his sisters and  nephews and nieces, whose embarrassing demands no calculated coldness  could repress.    \"Children are the root of all evil,\" said he. \"Happy the man who has his  quiver empty.\"    Sir Angus McCurdie did not reply at once; when he spoke again it was  with reference to their prospective host.    \"I met Deverill,\" said he, \"at the Royal Society's Soiree this year. One  of my assistants was demonstrating a peculiar property of thorium and  Deverill seemed interested. I asked him to come to my laboratory the  next day, and found he didn't know a damned thing about anything. That's  all the acquaintance I have with him.\"    Lord Doyne, the great administrator, who had been wearily turning over  the pages of an illustrated weekly chiefly filled with flamboyant  photographs of obscure actresses, took his gold glasses from his nose  and the black cigar from his lips, and addressed his companions.    \"I've been considerably interested in your conversation,\" said he, \"and  as you've been frank, I'll be frank too. I knew Mrs. Deverill's mother,  Lady Carstairs, very well years ago, and of course Mrs. Deverill when  she was a child. Deverill I came across once in Egypt--he had been sent  on a diplomatic mission to Teheran. As for our being invited on such  slight acquaintance, little Mrs. Deverill has the reputation of being  the only really successful celebrity hunter in England. She inherited  the faculty from her mother, who entertained the whole world. We're sure  to find archbishops, and eminent actors, and illustrious divorcees asked  to meet us. That's one thing. But why I, who loathe country house  parties and children and Christmas as much as Biggleswade, am going down  there to-day, I can no more explain than you can. It's a devilish odd  coincidence.\"    The three men looked at one another. Suddenly McCurdie shivered and drew  his fur coat around him.    \"I'll thank you,\" said he, \"to shut that window.\"    \"It is shut,\" said Doyne.    \"It's just uncanny,\" said McCurdie, looking from one to the other.    \"What?\" asked Doyne.    \"Nothing, if you didn't feel it.\"    \"There did seem to be a sudden draught,\" said Professor Biggleswade.  \"But as both window and door are shut, it could only be imaginary.\"    \"It wasn't imaginary,\" muttered McCurdie.    Then he laughed harshly. \"My father and mother came from Cromarty,\" he  said with apparent irrelevance.    \"That's the Highlands,\" said the Professor.    \"Ay,\" said McCurdie.    Lord Doyne said nothing, but tugged at his moustache and looked out of  the window as the frozen meadows and bits of river and willows raced  past. A dead silence fell on them. McCurdie broke it with another laugh  and took a whiskey flask from his hand-bag.    \"Have a nip?\"    \"Thanks, no,\" said the Professor. \"I have to keep to a strict dietary,  and I only drink hot milk and water--and of that sparingly. I have some  in a thermos bottle.\"    Lord Doyne also declining the whiskey, McCurdie swallowed a dram and  declared himself to be better. The Professor took from his bag a foreign  review in which a German sciolist had dared to question his  interpretation of a Hittite inscription. Over the man's ineptitude he  fell asleep and snored loudly.    To escape from his immediate neighbourhood McCurdie went to the other  end of the seat "]]]
