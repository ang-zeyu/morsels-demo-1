He had long wished to undertake the  work, and had talked much of it for several years past. But favorable  arrangements for the book's republication were not completed until about  a year ago. Then, though by no means recovered from an attack of  pneumonia late in the previous winter, he took up the task of revision  and recasting with something of his old-time energy. It was a far  heavier task than he had anticipated, but he gave it practically his  undivided attention until within three or four weeks of his death. Only  when the last pages of manuscript had been despatched to the printer did  he yield to the overwhelming physical suffering that had been upon him  for a long time past. His death occurred at Santa Barbara, California,  on May 11.    Francis Fisher Browne was born at South Halifax, Vermont, on December 1,  1843. His parentage, on both sides, was of the purest New England stock.  Early in his childhood, the family moved to Western Massachusetts, where  the boy went to school and learned the printing trade in his father's  newspaper office at Chicopee. As a lad of eighteen, he left the high  school in answer to the government's call for volunteers, serving for a  year with the 46th Massachusetts Regiment in North Carolina and with the  Army of the Potomac. When the regiment was discharged, in 1863, he  decided to take up the study of law. Removing to Rochester, N.Y., he  entered a law office in that city; and a year or two later began a brief  course in the law department of the University of Michigan. He was  unable to continue in college, however, and returned to Rochester to  follow his trade.    Immediately after his marriage, in 1867, he came to Chicago, with the  definite intention of engaging in literary work. Here he became  associated with \"The Western Monthly,\" which, with the fuller  establishment of his control, he rechristened \"The Lakeside Monthly.\"  The best writers throughout the West were gradually enlisted as  contributors; and it was not long before the magazine was generally  recognized as the most creditable and promising periodical west of the  Atlantic seaboard. But along with this increasing prestige came a series  of extraneous setbacks and calamities, culminating in a complete  physical breakdown of its editor and owner, which made the magazine's  suspension imperative.    [Illustration: FRANCIS F. BROWNE]    The six years immediately following, from 1874 to 1880, were largely  spent in a search for health. During part of this time, however, Mr.  Browne acted as literary editor of \"The Alliance,\" and as special  editorial writer for some of the leading Chicago newspapers. But his  mind was preoccupied with plans for a new periodical--this time a  journal of literary criticism, modeled somewhat after such English  publications as \"The Athenaeum\" and \"The Academy.\" In the furtherance of  this bold conception he was able to interest the publishing firm of  Jansen, McClurg & Co.; and under their imprint, in May, 1880, appeared  the first issue of THE DIAL, \"a monthly review and index of current  literature.\" At about the same time he became literary adviser to the  publishing department of the house, and for twelve years thereafter  toiled unremittingly at his double task-work. In 1892, negotiations were  completed whereby he acquired Messrs. McClurg & Co.'s interest in the  periodical. It was enlarged in scope, and made a semi-monthly; and from  that time until his death it appeared uninterruptedly under his guidance  and his control.    Besides his writings in THE DIAL and other periodicals, Mr. Browne is  the author of a small volume of poems, \"Volunteer Grain\" (1895). He also  compiled and edited several anthologies,--\"Bugle Echoes,\" a collection  of Civil War poems (1886); \"Golden Poems by British and American  Authors\" (1881); \"The Golden Treasury of Poetry and Prose\" (1883); and  seven volumes of \"Laurel-Crowned Verse\" (1891-2). He was one of the  small group of men who, in 1874, founded the Chicago Literary Club; and  for a number of years past he has been an honorary member of that  organization, as well as of the Caxton Club (Chicago) and the Twilight  Club (Pasadena, Cal.). During the summer of 1893 he served as Chairman  of the Committee on the Congress of Authors of the World's Congress  Auxiliary of the Columbian Exposition.    THE PUBLISHERS          PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION    The original edition of this book was published about twenty years after  Lincoln's death at the close of the Civil War. At that time many of the  men who had taken a prominent part in the affairs, military and civil,  of that heroic period, many who had known Lincoln and had come in  personal contact with him during the war or in his earlier years, were  still living. It was a vivid conception of the value of the personal  recollections of these men, gathered and recorded before it was too  late, that led to the preparation of this book. It was intended to be,  and in effect it was, largely an anecdotal Life of Lincoln built of  material gathered from men still living who had known him personally.  The task was begun none too soon. Of the hundreds who responded to the  requests for contributions of their memories of Lincoln there were few  whose lives extended very far into the second quarter-century after his  death, and few indeed survive after the lapse of nearly fifty  years,--though in several instances the author has been so fortunate as  to get valuable material directly from persons still living (1913). Of  the more than five hundred friends and contemporaries of Lincoln to whom  credit for material is given in the original edition, scarcely a dozen  are living at the date of this second edition. Therefore, the value of  these reminiscences increases with time. They were gathered largely at  first hand. They can never be replaced, nor can they ever be very much  extended.    This book brings Lincoln the man, not Lincoln the tradition, very near  to us. Browning asked, \"And did you once see Shelley plain? And did he  stop and speak to you?\" The men whose narratives make up a large part of  this book all saw Lincoln plain, and here tell us what he spoke to them,  and how he looked and seemed while saying it. The great events of  Lincoln's life, and impressions of his character, are given in the  actual words of those who knew him--his friends, neighbors, and daily  associates--rather than condensed and remolded into other form. While  these utterances are in some cases rude and unstudied, they have often a  power of delineation and a graphic force that more than compensate for  any lack of literary quality.    In a work prepared on such a plan as this, some repetitions are  unavoidable; nor are they undesirable. An event or incident narrated by  different observers is thereby brought out with greater fulness of  detail; and phases of Lincoln's many-sided character are revealed more  clearly by the varied impressions of numerous witnesses whose accounts  thus correct or verify each other. Some inconsistencies and  contradictions are inevitable,--but these relate usually to minor  matters, seldom or never to the great essentials of Lincoln's life and  personality. The author's desire is to present material from which the  reader may form an opinion of Lincoln, rather than to present opinions  and judgments of his own.    Lincoln literature has increased amazingly in the past twenty-five  years. Mention of the principal biographies in existence at the time of  the original edition was included in the Preface. Since then there have  appeared, among the more formal biographies, the comprehensive and  authoritative work by Nicolay and Hay, the subsequent work by Miss Ida"]]]
