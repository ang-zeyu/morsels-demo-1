Save for a slim  volume of privately printed verse it was my first book. I worked hard  on it. Fifteen years elapsed between its beginning and completion;  it was twice published serially--written, rewritten and  tre-written--before it reached its ultimate incarnation in book form.    Confronted now with the opportunity to revise the text again, I find  myself in the position of a surgeon who feels that the operation he  is called upon to perform may perhaps harm more than it can help.  Prudence therefore prevails over my passion for dissection: warned by  eminent examples, I fear that any injection of my more mature and less  cocksure consciousness into this book might impair its unity--that I  \"never could recapture the first fine careless rapture.\"    The text stands therefore as originally published save for a few  verbal changes, and whatever reservations I have about it shall  be stated in this preface. These are not many nor important: _The  Beautiful Necessity_ contains nothing that I need repudiate or care to  contradict.    Its thesis, briefly stated, is that art in all its manifestations is  an expression of the cosmic life, and that its symbols constitute a  language by means of which this life is published and represented. Art  is at all times subject to the _Beautiful Necessity_ of proclaiming  the _world order_.    In attempting to develop this thesis it was not necessary (nor as  I now think, desirable) to link it up in so definite a manner with  theosophy. The individual consciousness is colored by the particular  medium through which it receives truth, and for me that medium was  theosophy. Though the book might gain a more unprejudiced hearing,  and from a larger audience, by the removal of the theosophic  \"color-screen,\" it shall remain, for its removal now might seem to  imply a loss of faith in the fundamental tenets of theosophy, and such  an implication would not be true.    The ideas in regard to time and space are those commonly current  in the world until the advent of the Theory of Relativity. To a  generation brought up on Einstein and Ouspensky they are bound to  appear \"lower dimensional.\" Merely to state this fact is to deal  with it to the extent it needs to be dealt with. The integrity of my  argument is not impaired by these new views.    The one important influence that has operated to modify my opinions  concerning the mathematical basis of the arts of space has been the  discoveries of Mr. Jay Hambidge with regard to the practice of the  Greeks in these matters, as exemplified in their temples and their  ceramics, and named by him _Dynamic Symmetry_.    In tracing everything back to the logarithmic spiral (which embodies  the principle of extreme and mean ratios) I consider that Mr. Hambidge  has made one of those generalizations which reorganizes the old  knowledge and organizes the new. It would be only natural if in his  immersion in his idea he overworks it, but Mr. Hambidge is a man of  such intellectual integrity and thoroughness of method that he may be  trusted not to warp the facts to fit his theories. The truth of the  matter is that the entire field of research into the mathematics of  Beauty is of such richness that wherever a man plants his metaphysical  spade he is sure to come upon \"pay dirt.\" _The_ _Beautiful Necessity_  represents the result of my own prospecting; _Dynamic Symmetry_  represents the result of his. If at any point our findings appear to  conflict, it is less likely that one or the other of us is mistaken  than that each is right from his own point of view. Be that as it may,  I should be the last man in the world to differ from Mr. Hambidge,  for if he convicted me of every conceivable error his work would still  remain the greatest justification and confirmation of my fundamental  contention--that art is an expression of the _world order_ and  is therefore orderly, organic; subject to mathematical law, and  susceptible of mathematical analysis.    CLAUDE BRAGDON    Rochester, N.Y.    April, 1922          I    THE ART OF ARCHITECTURE      One of the advantages of a thorough assimilation of what may be called  the theosophic idea is that it can be applied with advantage to every  department of knowledge and of human activity: like the key to a  cryptogram it renders clear and simple that which before seemed  intricate and obscure. Let us apply this key to the subject of art,  and to the art of architecture in particular, and see if by so  doing we may not learn more of art than we knew before, and more of  theosophy too.    The theosophic idea is that everything is an expression of the  Self--or whatever other name one may choose to give to that immanent  unknown reality which forever hides behind all phenomenal life--but  because, immersed as we are in materiality, our chief avenue of  knowledge is sense perception, a more exact expression of the  theosophic idea would be: Everything is the expression of the Self  in terms of sense. Art, accordingly, is the expression of the Self in  terms of sense. Now though the Self is _one_, sense is not one, but  manifold: and therefore there are _arts_, each addressed to some  particular faculty or group of faculties, and each expressing some  particular quality or group of qualities of the Self. The white light  of Truth is thus broken up into a rainbow-tinted spectrum of Beauty,  in which the various arts are colors, each distinct, yet merging one  into another--poetry into music; painting into decoration; decoration  becoming sculpture; sculpture--architecture, and so on.    In such a spectrum of the arts each one occupies a definite place, and  all together form a series of which music and architecture are the two  extremes. That such is their relative position may be demonstrated in  various ways. The theosophic explanation involving the familiar idea  of the \"pairs of opposites\" would be something as follows. According  to the Hindu-Aryan theory, Brahma, that the world might be born, fell  asunder into man and wife--became in other words _name and form_[A]  The two universal aspects of name and form are what philosophers call  the two \"modes of consciousness,\" one of time, and the other of space.  These are the two gates through which ideas enter phenomenal life; the  two boxes, as it were, that contain all the toys with which we play.  Everything, were we only keen enough to perceive it, bears the mark of  one or the other of them, and may be classified accordingly. In such a  classification music is seen to be allied to time, and architecture to  space, because music is successive in its mode of manifestation, and  in time alone everything would occur successively, one thing following  another; while architecture, on the other hand, impresses itself upon  the beholder all at once, and in space alone all things would exist  simultaneously. Music, which is in time alone, without any relation to  space; and architecture, which is in space alone, without any relation  to time, are thus seen to stand at opposite ends of the art spectrum,  and to be, in a sense, the only \"pure\" arts, because in all the others  the elements of both time and space enter in varying proportion,  either actually or by implication. Poetry and the drama are allied to  music inasmuch as the ideas and images of which they are made up are  presented successively, yet these images are for the most part  forms of space. Sculpture on the other hand is clearly allied to  architecture, and so to space, but the element of _action_, suspended  though it be, affiliates it with the opposite or time pole. Painting  occupies a middle position, since in it space instead of being  actual has become ideal--three dimensions being expressed through  the mediumship of two--and time enters into it more largely than into  sculpture by reason of the greater ease with which complicated action  can be indicated: a picture being nearly always time arrested in  midcourse as it were--a moment transfixed.    In order to form a just conception of the relation between music and  architecture it is necessary that the two should be conceived of not  as standing at opposite ends of a series represented by a straight  line, but rather in juxtaposition, as in the ancient Egyptian symbol  of a serpent holding its tail in its mouth, the head in this case  corresponding to music, and the tail to architecture; in other words,  though in one sense they are the most-widely separated of the arts, in  another they are the most closely related.    Music being purely in time and architecture being purely in space,  each is, in a manner and to a degree not possible with any of  the other arts, convertible into the other, by reason of the  correspondence subsisting between intervals of time and intervals of  space. A perception of this may have inspired the famous saying  that architecture is _frozen music_, a poetical statement of a  philosophical truth, since that which in music is expressed by means  of harmonious intervals of time and pitch, successively, after the  manner of time, may be translated into corresponding intervals of  architectural void and solid, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#1)"],[1,"VICTORIA    By Lytton Strachey        New York Harcourt, Brace And Company, 1921        CONTENTS         I.

ANTECEDENTS    I    On November 6, 1817, died the Princess Charlotte, only child of the  Prince Regent, and heir to the crown of England. Her short life had  hardly been a happy one. By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement,  she had always longed for liberty; and she had never possessed it.  She had been brought up among violent family quarrels, had been early  separated from her disreputable and eccentric mother, and handed over to  the care of her disreputable and selfish father. When she was seventeen,  he decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at first,  acquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of  Prussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her  first love affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine  correspondence with a Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married,  morganatically, but she did not know it, and he did not tell her. While  she was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the  allied sovereign--it was June, 1814--arrived in London to celebrate  their victory. Among them, in the suite of the Emperor of Russia, was  the young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He made several  attempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with her heart  elsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,  discovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince  Augustus, suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her  household, sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. \"God  Almighty grant me patience!\" she exclaimed, falling on her knees in an  agony of agitation: then she jumped up, ran down the backstairs and out  into the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove to her mother's house  in Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length, yielding  to the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of  Brougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House  at two o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more  was heard of the Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared.  The way was at last open to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.    This Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent, to impress the  Ministers, and to make friends with another of the Princess's uncles,  the Duke of Kent. Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately  with the Princess, who now declared that he was necessary to  her happiness. When, after Waterloo, he was in Paris, the Duke's  aide-de-camp carried letters backwards and forwards across the Channel.  In January 1816 he was invited to England, and in May the marriage took  place.    The character of Prince Leopold contrasted strangely with that of  his wife. The younger son of a German princeling, he was at this time  twenty-six years of age; he had served with distinction in the war  against Napoleon; he had shown considerable diplomatic skill at the  Congress of Vienna; and he was now to try his hand at the task of taming  a tumultuous Princess. Cold and formal in manner, collected in speech,  careful in action, he soon dominated the wild, impetuous, generous  creature by his side. There was much in her, he found, of which he could  not approve. She quizzed, she stamped, she roared with laughter; she  had very little of that self-command which is especially required of  princes; her manners were abominable. Of the latter he was a good judge,  having moved, as he himself explained to his niece many years later, in  the best society of Europe, being in fact \"what is called in French de  la fleur des pois.\" There was continual friction, but every scene  ended in the same way. Standing before him like a rebellious boy in  petticoats, her body pushed forward, her hands behind her back, with  flaming cheeks and sparkling eyes, she would declare at last that she  was ready to do whatever he wanted. \"If you wish it, I will do it,\" she  would say. \"I want nothing for myself,\" he invariably answered; \"When  I press something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your  interest and for your good.\"    Among the members of the household at Claremont, near Esher, where the  royal pair were established, was a young German physician, Christian  Friedrich Stockmar. He was the son of a minor magistrate in Coburg, and,  after taking part as a medical officer in the war, he had settled down  as a doctor in his native town. Here he had met Prince Leopold, who had  been struck by his ability, and, on his marriage, brought him to England  as his personal physician. A curious fate awaited this young man;  many were the gifts which the future held in store for him--many and  various--influence, power, mystery, unhappiness, a broken heart. At  Claremont his position was a very humble one; but the Princess took  a fancy to him, called him \"Stocky,\" and romped with him along the  corridors. Dyspeptic by constitution, melancholic by temperament, he  could yet be lively on occasion, and was known as a wit in Coburg. He  was virtuous, too, and served the royal menage with approbation. \"My  master,\" he wrote in his diary, \"is the best of all husbands in all the  five quarters of the globe; and his wife bears him an amount of love,  the greatness of which can only be compared with the English national  debt.\" Before long he gave proof of another quality--a quality which was  to colour the whole of his life-cautious sagacity. When, in the spring  of 1817, it was known that the Princess was expecting a child, the post  of one of her physicians-in-ordinary was offered to him, and he had  the good sense to refuse it. He perceived that his colleagues would be  jealous of him, that his advice would probably not be taken, but that,  if anything were to go wrong, it would be certainly the foreign doctor  who would be blamed. Very soon, indeed, he came to the opinion that the  low diet and constant bleedings, to which the unfortunate Princess was  subjected, were an error; he drew the Prince aside, and begged him to  communicate this opinion to the English doctors; but it was useless. The  fashionable lowering treatment was continued for months. On November 5,  at nine o'clock in the evening, after a labour of over fifty hours, the  Princess was delivered of a dead boy. At midnight her exhausted strength  gave way. When, at last, Stockmar consented to see her; he went in, and  found her obviously dying, while the doctors were plying her with wine.  She seized his hand and pressed it. \"They have made me tipsy,\" she said.  After a little he left her, and was already in the next room when he  heard her call out in her loud voice: \"Stocky! Stocky!\" As he ran back  the death-rattle was in her throat. She tossed herself violently from  side to side; then suddenly drew up her legs, and it was over.    The Prince, after hours of watching, had left the room for a few  moments' rest; and Stockmar had now to tell him that his wife was dead.  At first he could not be made to realise what had happened. On their way  to her room he sank down on a chair while Stockmar knelt beside him: it  was all a dream; it was impossible. At last, by the bed, he, too, knelt  down and kissed the cold hands. Then rising and exclaiming, \"Now I am  quite desolate. Promise me never to leave me,\" he threw himself into  Stockmar's arms.    II    The tragedy at Claremont was of a most upsetting kind. The royal  kaleidoscope had suddenly shifted, and nobody could tell how the new  pattern would arrange itself. The succession to the throne, which had  seemed so satisfactorily settled, now became a matter of urgent doubt.    George III was still living, an aged lunatic, at Windsor, completely  impervious to the impressions of the outer world. Of his seven sons, the  youngest was of more than middle age, and none had legitimate offspring.  The outlook, therefore, was ambiguous. It seemed highly improbable that  the Prince Regent, who had lately been obliged to abandon his stays, and  presented a preposterous figure of debauched obesity, could ever again,  even on the supposition that he divorced his wife and re-married, become  the father of a family. Besides the Duke of Kent, who must be noticed  separately, the other brothers, in order of seniority, were the Dukes of  York, Clarence, Cumberland, Sussex, and Cambridge; their situations and  prospects require a brief description. The Duke of York, whose escapades  in times past with Mrs. Clarke and the army had brought him into  trouble, now divided his life between London and a large, extravagantly  ordered and extremely uncomfortable country house where he occupied  himself with racing, whist, and improper stories. He was remarkable  among the princes for one reason: he was the only one of them--so we  are informed by a highly competent observer--who had the feelings of a  gentleman. He had been long married to the Princess Royal of Prussia,  a lady who rarely went to bed and was perpetually surrounded by vast  numbers of dogs, parrots, and monkeys. They had no children. The Duke  of Clarence had lived for many years in complete obscurity with Mrs.  Jordan, the actress, in Bushey Park. By her he had had a large family  of sons and daughters, and had appeared, in effect to be married to her,  when he suddenly separated from her and offered to marry Miss Wykeham, a  crazy woman of large fortune, who, however, would have nothing to say to  him. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Jordan died in distressed circumstances  in Paris."]]]
