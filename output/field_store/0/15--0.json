Introduction by Professor Henry Morley.  Instructions for Writing History.  The True History.      Preface.      Book 1.      Book 2.  Icaro-Menippus--A Dialogue.        INTRODUCTION.        Lucian, in Greek Loukianos, was a Syrian, born about the year 120 at  Samosata, where a bend of the Euphrates brings that river nearest to  the borders of Cilicia in Asia Minor.  He had in him by nature a  quick flow of wit, with a bent towards Greek literature.  It was  thought at home that he showed as a boy the artist nature by his  skill in making little waxen images.  An uncle on his mother's side  happened to be a sculptor.  The home was poor, Lucian would have his  bread to earn, and when he was fourteen he was apprenticed to his  uncle that he might learn to become a sculptor.  Before long, while  polishing a marble tablet he pressed on it too heavily and broke it.  His uncle thrashed him.  Lucian's spirit rebelled, and he went home  giving the comic reason that his uncle beat him because jealous of  the extraordinary power he showed in his art.    After some debate Lucian abandoned training as a sculptor, studied  literature and rhetoric, and qualified himself for the career of an  advocate and teacher at a time when rhetoric had still a chief place  in the schools.  He practised for a short time unsuccessfully at  Antioch, and then travelled for the cultivation of his mind in  Greece, Italy, and Gaul, making his way by use of his wits, as  Goldsmith did long afterwards when he started, at the outset also of  his career as a writer, on a grand tour of the continent with  nothing in his pocket.  Lucian earned as he went by public use of  his skill as a rhetorician.  His travel was not unlike the modern  American lecturing tour, made also for the money it may bring and  for the new experience acquired by it.    Lucian stayed long enough in Athens to acquire a mastery of Attic  Greek, and his public discourses could not have been without full  seasoning of Attic salt.  In Italy and Gaul his success brought him  money beyond his present needs, and he went back to Samosata, when  about forty years old, able to choose and follow his own course in  life.    He then ceased to be a professional talker, and became a writer,  bold and witty, against everything that seemed to him to want  foundation for the honour that it claimed.  He attacked the gods of  Greece, and the whole system of mythology, when, in its second  century, the Christian Church was ready to replace the forms of  heathen worship.  He laughed at the philosophers, confounding  together in one censure deep conviction with shallow convention.  His vigorous winnowing sent chaff to the winds, but not without some  scattering of wheat.  Delight in the power of satire leads always to  some excess in its use.  But if the power be used honestly--and even  if it be used recklessly--no truth can be destroyed.  Only the  reckless use of it breeds in minds of the feebler sort mere pleasure  in ridicule, that weakens them as helpers in the real work of the  world, and in that way tends to retard the forward movement.  But on  the whole, ridicule adds more vigour to the strong than it takes  from the weak, and has its use even when levelled against what is  good and true.  In its own way it is a test of truth, and may be  fearlessly applied to it as jewellers use nitric acid to try gold.  If it be uttered for gold and is not gold, let it perish; but if it  be true, it will stand trial.    The best translation of the works of Lucian into English was that by  Dr. Thomas Francklin, sometime Greek Professor in the University of  Cambridge, which was published in two large quarto volumes in the  year 1780, and reprinted in four volumes in 1781.  Lucian had been  translated before in successive volumes by Ferrand Spence and  others, an edition, completed in 1711, for which Dryden had written  the author's Life.  Dr. Francklin, who produced also the best  eighteenth century translation of Sophocles, joined to his  translation of Lucian a little apparatus of introductions and notes  by which the English reader is often assisted, and he has skilfully  avoided the translation of indecencies which never were of any use,  and being no longer sources of enjoyment, serve only to exclude good  wit, with which, under different conditions of life, they were  associated, from the welcome due to it in all our homes.  There is a  just and scholarly, as well as a meddlesome and feeble way of  clearing an old writer from uncleannesses that cause him now to be a  name only where he should be a power.  Dr. Francklin has understood  his work in that way better than Dr. Bowdler did.  He does not  Bowdlerise who uses pumice to a blot, but he who rubs the copy into  holes wherever he can find an honest letter with a downstroke  thicker than becomes a fine-nibbed pen.  A trivial play of fancy in  one of the pieces in this volume, easily removed, would have been as  a dead fly in the pot of ointment, and would have deprived one of  Lucian's best works of the currency to which it is entitled.    Lucian's works are numerous, and they have been translated into  nearly all the languages of Europe.    The \"Instructions for Writing History\" was probably one of the  earliest pieces written by him after Lucian had settled down at  Samosata to the free use of his pen, and it has been usually  regarded as his best critical work.  With ridicule of the  affectations of historians whose names and whose books have passed  into oblivion, he joins sound doctrine upon sincerity of style.  \"Nothing is lasting that is feigned,\" said Ben Jonson; \"it will have  another face ere long.\"  Long after Lucian's day an artificial  dignity, accorded specially to work of the historian, bound him by  its conventions to an artificial style.  He used, as Johnson said of  Dr. Robertson, \"too big words and too many of them.\"  But that was  said by Johnson in his latter days, with admission of like fault in  the convention to which he had once conformed:  \"If Robertson's  style is bad, that is to say, too big words and too many of them, I  am afraid he caught it of me.\"  Lucian would have dealt as  mercilessly with that later style as Archibald Campbell, ship's  purser and son of an Edinburgh Professor, who used the form of one  of Lucian's dialogues, \"Lexiphanes,\" for an assault of ridicule upon  pretentious sentence-making, and helped a little to get rid of it.  Lucian laughed in his day at small imitators of the manner of  Thucydides, as he would laugh now at the small imitators of the  manner of Macaulay.  He bade the historian first get sure facts,  then tell them in due order, simply and without exaggeration or toil  after fine writing; though he should aim not the less at an enduring  grace given by Nature to the Art that does not stray from her, and  simply speaks the highest truth it knows.    The endeavour of small Greek historians to add interest to their  work by magnifying the exploits of their countrymen, and piling  wonder upon wonder, Lucian first condemned in his \"Instructions for  Writing History,\" and then caricatured in his \"True History,\"  wherein is contained the account of a trip to the moon, a piece  which must have been enjoyed by Rabelais, which suggested to Cyrano  de Bergerac his Voyages to the Moon and to the Sun, and insensibly  contributed, perhaps, directly or through Bergerac, to the  conception of \"Gulliver's Travels.\"  I have added the Icaro-  Menippus, because that Dialogue describes another trip to the moon,  though its satire is more especially directed against the  philosophers.    Menippus was born at Gadara in Coele-Syria, and from a slave he grew  to be a Cynic philosopher, chiefly occupied with scornful jests on  his neighbours, and a money-lender, who made large gains and killed  himself when he was cheated of them all.  He is said to have written  thirteen pieces which are lost, but he has left his name in  literature, preserved by important pieces that have taken the name  of \"Menippean Satire.\"    Lucian married in middle life, and had a son.  He was about fifty  years old when he went to Paphlagonia, and visited a false oracle to  detect the tricks of an Alexander who made profit out of it, and who  professed to have a daughter by the Moon.  When the impostor offered  Lucian his hand to kiss, Lucian bit his thumb; he also intervened to  the destruction of a profitable marriage for the daughter of the  Moon.  Alexander lent Lucian a vessel of his own for the voyage  onward, and gave instructions to the sailors that they were to find  a convenient time and place for throwing their passenger into the  sea; but when the convenient time had come the goodwill of the  master of the vessel saved Lucian's life.  He was landed, therefore,  at AEgialos, where he found some ambassadors to Eupator, King of  Bithynia, who took him onward upon his way.    It is believed that Lucian lived to be ninety, and it is assumed,  since he wrote a burlesque drama on gout, that the cause of his  death was not simply old age.  Gout may have been the immediate  cause of death.  Lucian must have spent much time at Athens, and he  held office at one time in his later years as Procurator of a part  of Egypt.    The works of Lucian consist largely of dialogues, in which he  battled against what he considered to be false opinions by bringing  the satire of Aristophanes and the sarcasm of Menippus into  disputations that sought chiefly to throw down false idols before  setting up the true.  He made many enemies by bold attacks upon the  ancient faiths.  His earlier \"Dialogues of the Gods\" only brought  out their stories in a way that made them sound ridiculous.  Afterwards he proceeded to direct attack on the belief in them.

I must say that it would relieve me of embarrassment, Mr.  Secretary, the embarrassment of feeling your reluctance and divergence  of judgment, if you would give your present office up and afford me an  opportunity to select some one whose mind would more willingly go along  with mine.\"    These words are taken from the letter which President Wilson wrote to me  on February 11, 1920. On the following day I tendered my resignation as  Secretary of State by a letter, in which I said:       \"Ever since January, 1919, I have been conscious of the fact that you     no longer were disposed to welcome my advice in matters pertaining to     the negotiations in Paris, to our foreign service, or to     international affairs in general. Holding these views I would, if I     had consulted my personal inclination alone, have resigned as     Secretary of State and as a Commissioner to Negotiate Peace. I felt,     however, that such a step might have been misinterpreted both at home     and abroad, and that it was my duty to cause you no embarrassment in     carrying forward the great task in which you were then engaged.\"    The President was right in his impression that, \"while we were still in  Paris,\" I had accepted his guidance and direction with reluctance. It  was as correct as my statement that, as early as January, 1919, I was  conscious that he was no longer disposed to welcome my advice in matters  pertaining to the peace negotiations at Paris.    There have been obvious reasons of propriety for my silence until now as  to the divergence of judgment, the differences of opinion and the  consequent breach in the relations between President Wilson and myself.  They have been the subject of speculation and inference which have left  uncertain the true record. The time has come when a frank account of our  differences can be given publicity without a charge being made of  disloyalty to the Administration in power.    The President, in his letter of February 11, 1920, from which the  quotation is made, indicated my unwillingness to follow him in the  course which he adopted at Paris, but he does not specifically point out  the particular subjects as to which we were not in accord. It is  unsatisfactory, if not criticizable, to leave the American people in  doubt as to a disagreement between two of their official representatives  upon a matter of so grave importance to the country as the negotiation  of the Treaty of Versailles. They are entitled to know the truth in  order that they may pass judgment upon the merits of the differences  which existed. I am not willing that the present uncertainty as to the  facts should continue. Possibly some may think that I have remained  silent too long. If I have, it has been only from a sense of obligation  to an Administration of which I was so long a member. It has not been  through lack of desire to lay the record before the public.    The statements which will be made in the succeeding pages will not be  entirely approved by some of my readers. In the circumstances it is far  too much to expect to escape criticism. The review of facts and the  comments upon them may be characterized in certain quarters as disloyal  to a superior and as violative of the seal of silence which is  considered generally to apply to the intercourse and communications  between the President and his official advisers. Under normal conditions  such a characterization would not be unjustified. But the present case  is different from the usual one in which a disagreement arises between a  President and a high official of his Administration.    Mr. Wilson made our differences at Paris one of the chief grounds for  stating that he would be pleased to take advantage of my expressed  willingness to resign. The manifest imputation was that I had advised  him wrongly and that, after he had decided to adopt a course contrary to  my advice, I had continued to oppose his views and had with reluctance  obeyed his instructions. Certainly no American official is in honor  bound to remain silent under such an imputation which approaches a  charge of faithlessness and of a secret, if not open, avoidance of duty.  He has, in my judgment, the right to present the case to the American  people in order that they may decide whether the imputation was  justified by the facts, and whether his conduct was or was not in the  circumstances in accord with the best traditions of the public service  of the United States.    A review of this sort becomes necessarily a personal narrative, which,  because of its intimate nature, is embarrassing to the writer, since he  must record his own acts, words, desires, and purposes, his own views as  to a course of action, and his own doubts, fears, and speculations as to  the future. If there were another method of treatment which would retain  the authoritative character of a personal statement, it would be a  satisfaction to adopt it."]]]
