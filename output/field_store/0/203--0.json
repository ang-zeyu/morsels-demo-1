THE GRAY CHAMPION.      There was once a time when New England groaned under the actual  pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on  the Revolution. James II., the bigoted successor of Charles the  Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a  harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger  our religion. The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely  a single characteristic of tyranny--a governor and council holding  office from the king and wholly independent of the country; laws made  and taxes levied without concurrence of the people, immediate or by  their representatives; the rights of private citizens violated and the  titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint  stifled by restrictions on the press; and finally, disaffection  overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on  our free soil. For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen  submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their  allegiance to the mother-country, whether its head chanced to be a  Parliament, Protector or popish monarch. Till these evil times,  however, such allegiance had been merely nominal, and the colonists  had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the  privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain.    At length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of Orange had  ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of  civil and religious rights and the salvation of New England. It was  but a doubtful whisper; it might be false or the attempt might fail,  and in either case the man that stirred against King James would lose  his head. Still, the intelligence produced a marked effect. The people  smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their  oppressors, while far and wide there was a subdued and silent  agitation, as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from  its sluggish despondency. Aware of their danger, the rulers resolved  to avert it by an imposing display of strength, and perhaps to confirm  their despotism by yet harsher measures.    One afternoon in April, 1689, Sir Edmund Andros and his favorite  councillors, being warm with wine, assembled the red-coats of the  governor's guard and made their appearance in the streets of Boston.  The sun was near setting when the march commenced. The roll of the  drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as  the martial music of the soldiers than as a muster-call to the  inhabitants themselves. A multitude by various avenues assembled in  King street, which was destined to be the scene, nearly a century  afterward, of another encounter between the troops of Britain and a  people struggling against her tyranny.    Though more than sixty years had elapsed since the Pilgrims came, this  crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features  of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency  than on happier occasions. There was the sober garb, the general  severity of mien, the gloomy but undismayed expression, the scriptural  forms of speech and the confidence in Heaven's blessing on a righteous  cause which would have marked a band of the original Puritans when  threatened by some peril of the wilderness. Indeed, it was not yet  time for the old spirit to be extinct, since there were men in the  street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a  house was reared to the God for whom they had become exiles. Old  soldiers of the Parliament were here, too, smiling grimly at the  thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the  house of Stuart. Here, also, were the veterans of King Philip's war,  who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious  fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them  with prayer. Several ministers were scattered among the crowd, which,  unlike all other mobs, regarded them with such reverence as if there  were sanctity in their very garments. These holy men exerted their  influence to quiet the people, but not to disperse them.    Meantime, the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the  town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country  into a ferment was almost the Universal subject of inquiry, and  variously explained.    \"Satan will strike his master-stroke presently,\" cried some, \"because  he knoweth that his time is short. All our godly pastors are to be  dragged to prison. We shall see them at a Smithfield fire in King  street.\"    Hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their  minister, who looked calmly upward and assumed a more apostolic  dignity, as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his  profession--a crown of martyrdom. It was actually fancied at that  period that New England might have a John Rogers of her own to take  the place of that worthy in the _Primer_.    \"The pope of Rome has given orders for a new St. Bartholomew,\" cried  others. \"We are to be massacred, man and male-child.\"    Neither was this rumor wholly discredited; although the wiser class  believed the governor's object somewhat less atrocious. His predecessor  under the old charter, Bradstreet, a venerable companion of the first  settlers, was known to be in town. There were grounds for conjecturing  that Sir Edmund Andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of  military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing  himself of their chief.    \"Stand firm for the old charter-governor!\" shouted the crowd, seizing  upon the idea--\"the good old Governor Bradstreet!\"    While this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the  well-known figure of Governor Bradstreet himself, a patriarch of  nearly ninety, who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with  characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted  authorities.    \"My children,\" concluded this venerable person, \"do nothing rashly.  Cry not aloud, but pray for the welfare of New England and expect  patiently what the Lord will do in this matter.\"    The event was soon to be decided. All this time the roll of the drum  had been approaching through Cornhill, louder and deeper, till with  reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial  footsteps it burst into the street. A double rank of soldiers made  their appearance, occupying the whole breadth of the passage, with  shouldered matchlocks and matches burning, so as to present a row of  fires in the dusk. Their steady march was like the progress of a  machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way. Next,  moving slowly, with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement, rode  a party of mounted gentlemen, the central figure being Sir Edmund  Andros, elderly, but erect and soldier-like. Those around him were his  favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of New England. At his  right hand rode Edward Randolph, our arch-enemy, that \"blasted  wretch,\" as Cotton Mather calls him, who achieved the downfall of our  ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse-through life  and to his grave. On the other side was Bullivant, scattering jests  and mockery as he rode along. Dudley came behind with a downcast look,  dreading, as well he might, to meet the indignant gaze of the people,  who beheld him, their only countryman by birth, among the oppressors  of his native land.

At their  hospitable boards I occasionally met with partners, and clerks, and  hardy fur traders from the interior posts; men who had passed years  remote from civilized society, among distant and savage tribes, and  who had wonders to recount of their wide and wild peregrinations, their  hunting exploits, and their perilous adventures and hair-breadth escapes  among the Indians. I was at an age when imagination lends its coloring  to everything, and the stories of these Sinbads of the wilderness made  the life of a trapper and fur trader perfect romance to me. I even  meditated at one time a visit to the remote posts of the company in  the boats which annually ascended the lakes and rivers, being thereto  invited by one of the partners; and I have ever since regretted that I  was prevented by circumstances from carrying my intention into effect.  From those early impressions, the grand enterprise of the great fur  companies, and the hazardous errantry of their associates in the wild  parts of our vast continent, have always been themes of charmed  interest to me; and I have felt anxious to get at the details of their  adventurous expeditions among the savage tribes that peopled the depths  of the wilderness.    About two years ago, not long after my return from a tour upon the  prairies of the far West, I had a conversation with my friend, Mr.  John Jacob Astor, relative to that portion of our country, and to the  adventurous traders to Santa Fe and the Columbia. This led him to advert  to a great enterprise set on foot and conducted by him, between twenty  and thirty years since, having for its object to carry the fur trade  across the Rocky Mountains, and to sweep the shores of the Pacific.    Finding that I took an interest in the subject, he expressed a regret  that the true nature and extent of his enterprise and its national  character and importance had never been understood, and a wish that I  would undertake to give an account of it. The suggestion struck upon the  chord of early associations already vibrating in my mind. It occurred  to me that a work of this kind might comprise a variety of those curious  details, so interesting to me, illustrative of the fur trade; of its  remote and adventurous enterprises, and of the various people, and  tribes, and castes, and characters, civilized and savage, affected by  its operations. The journals, and letters, also, of the adventurers by  sea and land employed by Mr. Astor in his comprehensive project, might  throw light upon portions of our country quite out of the track of  ordinary travel, and as yet but little known. I therefore felt disposed  to undertake the task, provided documents of sufficient extent and  minuteness could be furnished to me. All the papers relative to the  enterprise were accordingly submitted to my inspection. Among them were  journals and letters narrating expeditions by sea, and journeys to and  fro across the Rocky Mountains by routes before untravelled, together  with documents illustrative of savage and colonial life on the borders  of the Pacific. With such material in hand, I undertook the work.  The trouble of rummaging among business papers, and of collecting and  collating facts from amidst tedious and commonplace details, was spared  me by my nephew, Pierre M. Irving, who acted as my pioneer, and to whom  I am greatly indebted for smoothing my path and lightening my labors.    As the journals, on which I chiefly depended, had been kept by men of  business, intent upon the main object of the enterprise, and but little  versed in science, or curious about matters not immediately bearing upon  their interest, and as they were written often in moments of fatigue  or hurry, amid the inconveniences of wild encampments, they were  often meagre in their details, furnishing hints to provoke rather  than narratives to satisfy inquiry. I have, therefore, availed myself  occasionally of collateral lights supplied by the published journals of  other travellers who have visited the scenes described: such as Messrs.  Lewis and Clarke, Bradbury, Breckenridge, Long, Franchere, and Ross Cox,  and make a general acknowledgment of aid received from these quarters.    The work I here present to the public is necessarily of a rambling  and somewhat disjointed nature, comprising various expeditions and  adventures by land and sea. The facts, however, will prove to be linked  and banded together by one grand scheme, devised and conducted by  a master spirit; one set of characters, also, continues throughout,  appearing occasionally, though sometimes at long intervals, and the  whole enterprise winds up by a regular catastrophe; so that the work,  without any labored attempt at artificial construction, actually  possesses much of that unity so much sought after in works of fiction,  and considered so important to the interest of every history.

TWO leading objects of commercial gain have given birth to wide and  daring enterprise in the early history of the Americas; the precious  metals of the South, and the rich peltries of the North. While the fiery  and magnificent Spaniard, inflamed with the mania for gold, has extended  his discoveries and conquests over those brilliant countries scorched by  the ardent sun of the tropics, the adroit and buoyant Frenchman, and the  cool and calculating Briton, have pursued the less splendid, but no  less lucrative, traffic in furs amidst the hyperborean regions of the  Canadas, until they have advanced even within the Arctic Circle.    These two pursuits have thus in a manner been the pioneers and  precursors of civilization. Without pausing on the borders, they have  penetrated at once, in defiance of difficulties and dangers, to the  heart of savage countries: laying open the hidden secrets of the  wilderness; leading the way to remote regions of beauty and fertility  that might have remained unexplored for ages, and beckoning after them  the slow and pausing steps of agriculture and civilization.    It was the fur trade, in fact, which gave early sustenance and vitality  to the great Canadian provinces. Being destitute of the precious metals,  at that time the leading objects of American enterprise, they were long  neglected by the parent country. The French adventurers, however, who  had settled on the banks of the St. Lawrence, soon found that in the  rich peltries of the interior, they had sources of wealth that  might almost rival the mines of Mexico and Peru. The Indians, as yet  unacquainted with the artificial value given to some descriptions of  furs, in civilized life, brought quantities of the most precious kinds  and bartered them away for European trinkets and cheap commodities.  Immense profits were thus made by the early traders, and the traffic was  pursued with avidity.    As the valuable furs soon became scarce in the neighborhood of the  settlements, the Indians of the vicinity were stimulated to take a wider  range in their hunting expeditions; they were generally accompanied on  these expeditions by some of the traders or their dependents, who  shared in the toils and perils of the chase, and at the same time made  themselves acquainted with the best hunting and trapping grounds, and  with the remote tribes, whom they encouraged to bring their peltries  to the settlements. In this way the trade augmented, and was drawn from  remote quarters to Montreal. Every now and then a large body of Ottawas,  Hurons, and other tribes who hunted the countries bordering on the great  lakes, would come down in a squadron of light canoes, laden with beaver  skins, and other spoils of their year's hunting. The canoes would be  unladen, taken on shore, and their contents disposed in order. A camp of  birch bark would be pitched outside of the town, and a kind of primitive  fair opened with that grave ceremonial so dear to the Indians. An  audience would be demanded of the governor-general, who would hold  the conference with becoming state, seated in an elbow-chair, with the  Indians ranged in semicircles before him, seated on the ground,  and silently smoking their pipes. Speeches would be made, presents  exchanged, and the audience would break up in universal good humor.    Now would ensue a brisk traffic with the merchants, and all Montreal  would be alive with naked Indians running from shop to shop, bargaining  for arms, kettles, knives, axes, blankets, bright-colored cloths, and  other articles of use or fancy; upon all which, says an old French  writer, the merchants were sure to clear at least two hundred per cent.  There was no money used in this traffic, and, after a time, all payment  in spirituous liquors was"]]]
