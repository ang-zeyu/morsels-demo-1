Knowledge of the right sort will prevent many wrecked lives. Ignorance  as to facts and to the best manner of presenting them prevents many  a parent from daring to trespass upon such sacred ground, and the  instruction is postponed from day to day until it is too late.    With the desire to aid mothers in giving the necessary instruction to  their daughters, this little book has been written. The author has tried  to tell in suitable language the facts that should be known by every  girl from ten to fourteen years of age. The book is of such a character  that it may be placed in the hands of the young girl, but better still  it may be read aloud by the mother to her daughter. It is hoped this  book will form the basis of a closer intimacy between mother and  daughter, and that the knowledge herein set forth will forestall that  which might be given in an entirely different spirit by the girl's  companions.

Longfellow.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER I    THE SECRET      Listen, Violet, I am going to tell you a wonderful secret. And this  wonderful secret is about your namesakes, the violets. Every little  flower that grows is a living being, as you or I--and every plant is a  household. How do I know this? The flowers told me themselves, and now  I am going to let you into the secret.    Of course, I must admit that the flowers do not talk as we do. Unlike  ourselves, they cannot express themselves aloud. They must show their  thoughts by their motions or by their change of expression. When a  flower is thirsty, how does it tell us so? By drooping its head and  looking sad. Then, if we give it a drink, how quickly it says, \"Thank  you!\" by lifting its head and smiling at us.    If we would have the flowers tell us their secrets, we must watch them  very closely so as to be able to hear what they say. Sometimes, however,  we must learn from others what the plants like, for at first, until we  are better acquainted, we will not be able to understand them, and might  make many mistakes; so I am going to tell you a few things today.    First, we must learn something about the flower's family, and where the  flower gets its food. The flowers are a part of the plant household just  the same as you or any little girl is only a part of the family. You  could not very well live without the rest of the family--your father and  mother, who do so many things for you and take such care of you, and  your brothers and sisters, who all help to make the home happy.    The flower is like a little girl and needs some one to care for her. Do  you know the other members of the plant household?    First, there are the roots, whose work it is to hold the plant in place  so it will not be tossed about by every wind. The roots also must draw  the water and nourishment from the ground. You know when the rain comes,  it soaks into the ground and then when the plant needs water the little  roots suck it out of the ground just as you could draw lemonade through  a straw, for every root is supplied with many hair tubes that serve as  straws. These hair tubes often are so small we could not see them  without a microscope, but it is through these tiny tubes the plant  receives nearly all the water it uses.    Other members of the family, the leaves, are kept busy, for they must do  the breathing for the plant, as well as digest the food. You know water  is never quite free from mineral matter, so when the roots draw up the  water from the ground, they also draw up some mineral food for the plant  which is dissolved in the water. Before the plant can make use of this  food, it must be digested by the leaves, much the same as your stomach  must digest the food you eat. That is, it must change it into another  form. But in order that the leaves may do this, they must have plenty  of chlorophyll, which is the green coloring matter of the leaves. This  chlorophyll will grow in the leaves if they have plenty of sunlight, and  if it does not grow the leaves will not be able to digest the food and  the plant will starve. So you see how necessary it is for plants to have  plenty of sunshine, and why they lose their green color and then die if  they are kept away from the light. They really are starved to death.                 *       *       *       *       *          Flowers are words    Which even a babe may understand.      Bishop Coxe.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER II    THE FLOWER BABIES      The flower itself has many parts, just as there are many parts to your  body. When the flower is a little bud, or baby, rocked by the breezes,  it is closely wrapped in a little green cloak. We call this cloak the  calyx, because when it opens it looks like a cup, and the word calyx  means cup. After the bud is grown, it opens its cloak and throws it  back. Then we see the pretty dress underneath. We call this dress the  corolla. Sometimes it is all in one piece, but often it is divided into  several leaf-like parts which we call petals.    If we look within the dress or corolla, we find the real body of  the flower, which is called the pistil. Its shape varies greatly in  different plants, but it always consists of two or three distinct parts.  One of these is the cradle for the seeds, and is called the ovary.  At one end of the ovary is usually a little tube leading down into it.  This tube is called the style, and the opening at the other end is  called the stigma. Each ovary or cradle contains one or more ovules  which by and by will grow into seeds. Just outside the pistil of a  flower you usually will find a row of slender, thread-like stalks, each  bearing a soft, oblong body at the top, falling out of which you will  see a fine yellow powder called pollen. It is a peculiar fact that these  seeds never can grow into new plants unless they are fertilized, that  is, unless they receive some pollen. It is another peculiar fact that  although nearly every flower has this pollen growing right near the  little ovules, yet they cannot be fertilized with this pollen, but must  receive some from the flower of another plant family.    This pollen is carried from one plant to another by the wind or by the  bees and butterflies that come visiting in search of honey. In fact, the  flower coaxes the bees and butterflies to come so they may bring her the  pollen. Soon after the seed is fertilized it is ripe; that is, it is  ready to leave its cradle, the ovary. It is now ready to grow into a new  plant. But before it can grow it must be put into a little nest in the  ground. But the poor plant is so helpless that she is unable to prepare  this nest herself, so all she can do is to scatter her seed babies out  on the ground and hope some one will take pity on them and make a nice  nest for them. Sometimes the wind helps her by blowing some dirt and  dead leaves over them, for you know the seeds cannot grow unless they  are covered nice and warm. Sometimes the children and grown people help  her by preparing a nice flower-bed.    For a long time the tiny seed lies very quietly in its warm nest, and if  we could peek at it we could not see it move at all, but all the time it  is growing very slowly, until finally some bright day it will send up  its little sprouts, and then we will see that all the time the seed was  lying so quietly it was growing into a baby flower.                 *       *       *       *       *      \"So the Bluebirds have contracted, have they, for a house?    And a nest is under way for little Mr. Wren?\"    \"Hush, dear, hush! Be quiet, dear! quiet as a mouse.    These are weighty secrets, and we must whisper them.\"      Susan Coolidge.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III    THE BIRD BABIES      Today, Violet, I shall tell you another secret, but this time the secret  is not about flowers, but about something else we love very dearly.  I intend to tell you some secrets about the birds. I wonder if you know  how much they are like the flowers?    You remember, the flowers had a language which we could understand, even  if they did not talk out loud. The birds, too, have a language of their  own, and they can express themselves better than the flowers, for they  have a sign language, and are also able to make sounds. How much we  enjoy hearing the birds sing, not only because they make beautiful  music, but because they are telling us how happy they are!    If birds are in pain or in trouble, their notes are quite different  from when they are singing; while, if they or their little ones are  in danger, they quickly send forth a note of warning."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#1)"],[1,"CAMP FIRES    BY    STEWART EDWARD WHITE         THOMAS NELSON AND SONS       LONDON, EDINBURGH, DUBLIN       AND NEW YORK          CONTENTS.

TO THE ISLAND OF WAR.          I.    THE OPEN DOOR.      There are many interesting hotels scattered about the world, with a few  of which I am acquainted and with a great many of which I am not. Of  course all hotels are interesting, from one point of view or another. In  fact, the surest way to fix an audience's attention is to introduce your  hero, or to display your opening chorus in the lobby or along the facade  of a hotel. The life, the movement and colour, the drifting  individualities, the pretence, the bluff, the self-consciousness, the  independence, the _ennui_, the darting or lounging servants, the very  fact that of those before your eyes seven out of ten are drawn from  distant and scattered places, are sufficient in themselves to invest the  smallest hostelry with glamour. It is not of this general interest that  I would now speak. Nor is it my intention at present to glance at the  hotels wherein \"quaintness\" is specialized, whether intentionally or no.  There are thousands of them; and all of them well worth the  discriminating traveller's attention. Concerning some of them--as the  old inns at Dives-sur-Mer and at Mont St. Michel--whole books have been  written. These depend for their charm on a mingled gift of the unusual  and the picturesque. There are, as I have said, thousands of them; and  of their cataloguing, should one embark on so wide a sea, there could be  no end. And, again, I must for convenience exclude the altogether  charming places, like the Tour d'Argent of Paris, Simpson's of the  Strand,[1] and a dozen others that will spring to every traveller's  memory, where the personality of the host, or of a chef, or even a  waiter, is at once a magnet for the attraction of visitors and a reward  for their coming. These, too, are many. In the interest to which I would  draw attention, the hotel as a building or as an institution has little  part. It is indeed a facade, a _mise en scene_before which play the  actors that attract our attention and applause. The set may be as  modernly elaborate as Peacock Alley of the Waldorf or the templed lobby  of the St. Francis; or it may present the severe and Elizabethan  simplicity of the stone-paved veranda of the Norfolk at Nairobi--the  matter is quite inessential to the spectator. His appreciation is only  slightly and indirectly influenced by these things. Sunk in his  arm-chair--of velvet or of canvas--he puffs hard and silently at his  cigar, watching and listening as the pageant and the conversation eddy  by.    Of such hotels I number that gaudy and polysyllabic hostelry the Grand  Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix at Marseilles. I am indifferent to the  facts that it is situated on that fine thoroughfare, the Rue de  Cannebiere, which the proud and untravelled native devoutly believes to  be the finest street in the world; that it possesses a dining-room of  gilded and painted _repousse_ work so elaborate and wonderful that it  surely must be intended to represent a tinsmith's dream of heaven; that  its concierge is the most impressive human being on earth except Ludwig  von Kampf (whom I have never seen); that its head waiter is sadder and  more elderly and forgiving than any other head waiter; and that its  hushed and cathedral atmosphere has been undisturbed through immemorial  years. That is to be expected; and elsewhere to be duplicated in  greater or lesser degree. Nor in the lofty courtyard, or the equally  lofty halls and reading-rooms, is there ever much bustle and movement.  People sit quietly, or move with circumspection. Servants glide. The  fall of a book or teaspoon, the sudden closing of a door, are events to  be remarked. Once a day, however, a huge gong sounds, the glass doors of  the inner courtyard are thrown open with a flourish, and enters the huge  bus fairly among those peacefully sitting at the tables, horses' hoofs  striking fire, long lash-cracking volleys, wheels roaring amid hollow  reverberations. From the interior of this bus emerge people; and from  the top, by means of a strangely-constructed hooked ladder, are decanted  boxes, trunks, and appurtenances of various sorts. In these people, and  in these boxes, trunks, and appurtenances, are the real interest of the  Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix of the marvellous Rue Cannebiere of  Marseilles.    For at Marseilles land ships, many ships, from all the scattered ends of  the earth; and from Marseilles depart trains for the North, where is  home, or the way home for many peoples. And since the arrival of ships  is uncertain, and the departure of trains fixed, it follows that  everybody descends for a little or greater period at the Grand Hotel du  Louvre et de la Paix.    They come lean and quiet and a little yellow from hard climates, with  the names of strange places on their lips, and they speak familiarly of  far-off things. Their clothes are generally of ancient cut, and the  wrinkles and camphor aroma of a long packing away are yet discernible.  Often they are still wearing sun helmets or double terai hats, pending a  descent on a Piccadilly hatter two days hence. They move slowly and  languidly; the ordinary piercing and dominant English enunciation has  fallen to modulation; their eyes, while observant and alert, look tired.  It is as though the far countries have sucked something from the pith of  them in exchange for great experiences that nevertheless seem of little  value; as though these men, having met at last face to face the ultimate  of what the earth has to offer in the way of danger, hardship,  difficulty, and the things that try men's souls, having unexpectedly  found them all to fall short of both the importance and the final  significance with which human-kind has always invested them, were now  just a little at a loss. Therefore they stretch their long, lean frames  in the wicker chairs, they sip the long drinks at their elbows, puff  slowly at their long, lean cheroots, and talk spasmodically in short  sentences.    Of quite a different type are those going out--young fellows full of  northern health and energy, full of the eagerness of anticipation, full  of romance skilfully concealed, self-certain, authoritative, clear  voiced. Their exit from the bus is followed by a rain of hold-alls,  bags, new tin boxes, new gun cases, all lettered freshly--an enormous  kit doomed to diminution. They overflow the place, ebb towards their  respective rooms; return scrubbed and ruddy, correctly clad, correctly  unconscious of everybody else; sink into more wicker chairs. The quiet  brown and yellow men continue to puff at their cheroots, quite eclipsed.  After a time one of them picks up his battered old sun helmet and goes  out into the street. The eyes of the newcomers follow him. They fall  silent; and their eyes, under cover of pulled moustache, furtively  glance towards the lean man's companions. Then on that office falls a  great silence, broken only by the occasional rare remarks of the quiet  men with the cheroots. The youngsters are listening with all their ears,  though from their appearance no one would suspect that fact. Not a  syllable escapes them. These quiet men have been there; they have seen  with their own eyes; their lightest word is saturated with the mystery  and romance of the unknown. Their easy, matter-of-fact, everyday  knowledge is richly wonderful. It would seem natural for these  young-young men to question these old-young men of that which they  desire so ardently to know; but that isn't done, you know. So they sit  tight, and pretend they are not listening, and feast their ears on the  wonderful syllables--Ankobar, Kabul, Peshawur, Annam, Nyassaland,  Kerman, Serengetti, Tanganika, and many others. On these beautiful  syllables must their imaginations feed, for that which is told is as  nothing at all. Adventure there is none, romance there is none, mention  of high emprise there is none. Adventure, romance, high emprise have to  these men somehow lost their importance. Perhaps such things have been  to them too common--as well mention the morning egg. Perhaps they have  found that there is no genuine adventure, no real romance"]]]
