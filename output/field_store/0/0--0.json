I trust that my instincts are not awry  when they prompt me to leave the account, in simplicity, as it was  handed to me.    And the MS. itself--You must picture me, when first it was given into my  care, turning it over, curiously, and making a swift, jerky examination.  A small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filled  with a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close. I have the  queer, faint, pit-water smell of it in my nostrils now as I write, and  my fingers have subconscious memories of the soft, \"cloggy\" feel of the  long-damp pages.    I read, and, in reading, lifted the Curtains of the Impossible that  blind the mind, and looked out into the unknown. Amid stiff, abrupt  sentences I wandered; and, presently, I had no fault to charge against  their abrupt tellings; for, better far than my own ambitious phrasing,  is this mutilated story capable of bringing home all that the old  Recluse, of the vanished house, had striven to tell.    Of the simple, stiffly given account of weird and extraordinary matters,  I will say little. It lies before you. The inner story must be uncovered,  personally, by each reader, according to ability and desire. And even  should any fail to see, as now I see, the shadowed picture and conception  of that to which one may well give the accepted titles of Heaven and Hell;  yet can I promise certain thrills, merely taking the story as a story.    WILLIAM HOPE HODGSON December 17, 1907        _I_    THE FINDING OF THE MANUSCRIPT    Right away in the west of Ireland lies a tiny hamlet called Kraighten.  It is situated, alone, at the base of a low hill. Far around there  spreads a waste of bleak and totally inhospitable country; where, here  and there at great intervals, one may come upon the ruins of some long  desolate cottage--unthatched and stark. The whole land is bare and  unpeopled, the very earth scarcely covering the rock that lies beneath  it, and with which the country abounds, in places rising out of the soil  in wave-shaped ridges.    Yet, in spite of its desolation, my friend Tonnison and I had elected to  spend our vacation there. He had stumbled on the place by mere chance  the year previously, during the course of a long walking tour, and  discovered the possibilities for the angler in a small and unnamed river  that runs past the outskirts of the little village.    I have said that the river is without name; I may add that no map that I  have hitherto consulted has shown either village or stream. They seem  to have entirely escaped observation: indeed, they might never exist for  all that the average guide tells one. Possibly this can be partly  accounted for by the fact that the nearest railway station (Ardrahan) is  some forty miles distant.    It was early one warm evening when my friend and I arrived in Kraighten.  We had reached Ardrahan the previous night, sleeping there in rooms  hired at the village post office, and leaving in good time on the  following morning, clinging insecurely to one of the typical  jaunting cars.    It had taken us all day to accomplish our journey over some of the  roughest tracks imaginable, with the result that we were thoroughly  tired and somewhat bad tempered. However, the tent had to be erected and  our goods stowed away before we could think of food or rest. And so we  set to work, with the aid of our driver, and soon had the tent up upon a  small patch of ground just outside the little village, and quite near to  the river.    Then, having stored all our belongings, we dismissed the driver, as he  had to make his way back as speedily as possible, and told him to come  across to us at the end of a fortnight. We had brought sufficient  provisions to last us for that space of time, and water we could get  from the stream. Fuel we did not need, as we had included a small  oil-stove among our outfit, and the weather was fine and warm.    It was Tonnison's idea to camp out instead of getting lodgings in one of  the cottages. As he put it, there was no joke in sleeping in a room with  a numerous family of healthy Irish in one corner and the pigsty in the  other, while overhead a ragged colony of roosting fowls distributed  their blessings impartially, and the whole place so full of peat smoke  that it made a fellow sneeze his head off just to put it inside  the doorway.    Tonnison had got the stove lit now and was busy cutting slices of bacon  into the frying pan; so I took the kettle and walked down to the river  for water. On the way, I had to pass close to a little group of the  village people, who eyed me curiously, but not in any unfriendly manner,  though none of them ventured a word.    As I returned with my kettle filled, I went up to them and, after a  friendly nod, to which they replied in like manner, I asked them  casually about the fishing; but, instead of answering, they just shook  their heads silently, and stared at me. I repeated the question,  addressing more particularly a great, gaunt fellow at my elbow; yet  again I received no answer. Then the man turned to a comrade and said  something rapidly in a language that I did not understand; and, at once,  the whole crowd of them fell to jabbering in what, after a few moments,  I guessed to be pure Irish. At the same time they cast many glances in  my direction. For a minute, perhaps, they spoke among themselves thus;  then the man I had addressed faced 'round at me and said something. By  the expression of his face I guessed that he, in turn, was questioning  me; but now I had to shake my head, and indicate that I did not  comprehend what it was they wanted to know; and so we stood looking at  one another, until I heard Tonnison calling to me to hurry up with the  kettle. Then, with a smile and a nod, I left them, and all in the little  crowd smiled and nodded in return, though their faces still betrayed  their puzzlement.    It was evident, I reflected as I went toward the tent, that the  inhabitants of these few huts in the wilderness did not know a word of  English; and when I told Tonnison, he remarked that he was aware of the  fact, and, more, that it was not at all uncommon in that part of the  country, where the people often lived and died in their isolated hamlets  without ever coming in contact with the outside world.    \"I wish we had got the driver to interpret for us before he left,\" I  remarked, as we sat down to our meal. \"It seems so strange for the  people of this place not even to know what we've come for.\"    Tonnison grunted an assent, and thereafter was silent for a while.    Later, having satisfied our appetites somewhat, we began to talk, laying  our plans for the morrow; then, after a smoke, we closed the flap of the  tent, and prepared to turn in.    \"I suppose there's no chance of those fellows outside taking anything?\"  I asked, as we rolled ourselves in our blankets.    Tonnison said that he did not think so, at least while we were about;  and, as he went on to explain, we could lock up everything, except the  tent, in the big chest that we had brought to hold our provisions. I  agreed to this, and soon we were both asleep.    Next morning, early, we rose and went for a swim in the river; after  which we dressed and had breakfast. Then we roused out our fishing  tackle and overhauled it, by which time, our breakfasts having settled  somewhat, we made all secure within the tent and strode off in the  direction my friend had explored on his previous visit.    During the day we fished happily, working steadily upstream, and by  evening we had one of the prettiest creels of fish that I had seen for a  long while. Returning to the village, we made a good feed off our day's  spoil, after which, having selected a few of the finer fish for our  breakfast, we presented the remainder to the group of villagers who had  assembled at a respectful distance to watch our doings. They seemed  wonderfully grateful, and heaped mountains of what I presumed to be  Irish blessings upon our heads.    Thus we spent several days, having splendid sport, and first-rate  appetites to do justice upon our prey. We were pleased to find how  friendly the villagers were inclined to be, and that there was no  evidence of their having ventured to meddle with our belongings during  our absences.    It was on a Tuesday that we arrived in Kraighten, and it would be on the  Sunday following that we made a great discovery. Hitherto we had always  gone up-stream; on that day, however, we laid aside our rods, and,  taking some provisions, set off for a long ramble in the opposite  direction. The day was warm, and we trudged along leisurely enough,  stopping about mid-day to eat our lunch upon a great flat rock near the  riverbank. Afterward we sat and smoked awhile, resuming our walk only  when we were tired of inaction.    For perhaps another hour we wandered onward, chatting quietly and  comfortably on this and that matter, and on several occasions stopping  while my companion--who is something of an artist--made rough sketches  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10011"],[0,"365 Foreign Dishes (#1)"],[1,"PG Distributed Proofreaders          365 FOREIGN DISHES      A Foreign Dish for every day in the year      1908          _JANUARY._      1.--Austrian Goulasch.
