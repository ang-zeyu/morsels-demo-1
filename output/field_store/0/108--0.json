AUSTIN FREEMAN    Author of \"The Red Thumb Mark,\"  \"The Eye of Osiris,\" etc.          TO MY FRIEND    BERNARD E. BISHOP          Preface      Commenting upon one of my earlier novels, in respect of which I had  claimed to have been careful to adhere to common probabilities and to  have made use only of really practicable methods of investigation, a  critic remarked that this was of no consequence whatever, so long as the  story was amusing.    Few people, I imagine, will agree with him. To most readers, and  certainly to the kind of reader for whom an author is willing to take  trouble, complete realism in respect of incidents and methods is an  essential factor in maintaining the interest of a detective story. Hence  it may be worth while to mention that Thorndyke's method of producing  the track chart, described in Chapters II and III, has been actually  used in practice. It is a modification of one devised by me many years  ago when I was crossing Ashanti to the city of Bontuku, the whereabouts  of which in the far interior was then only vaguely known. My  instructions were to fix the positions of all towns, villages, rivers  and mountains as accurately as possible; but finding ordinary methods of  surveying impracticable in the dense forest which covers the whole  region, I adopted this simple and apparently rude method, checking the  distances whenever possible by astronomical observation.    The resulting route-map was surprisingly accurate, as shown by the  agreement of the outward and homeward tracks, It was published by the  Royal Geographical Society, and incorporated in the map of this region  compiled by the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, and it formed the  basis of the map which accompanied my volume of <i>Travels in Ashanti and  Jaman</i>. So that Thorndyke's plan must be taken as quite a practicable  one.    New Inn, the background of this story, and one of the last surviving  inns of Chancery, has recently passed away after upwards of four  centuries of newness. Even now, however, a few of the old, dismantled  houses (including perhaps, the mysterious 31) may be seen from the  Strand peeping over the iron roof of the skating rink which has  displaced the picturesque hall, the pension-room and the garden. The  postern gate, too, in Houghton Street still remains, though the arch is  bricked up inside. Passing it lately, I made the rough sketch which  appears on next page, and which shows all that is left of this pleasant  old London backwater.    R. A. F.

Many of these experiences I have already placed on record;  but it now occurs to me that I have hitherto left unrecorded one that  is, perhaps, the most astonishing and incredible of the whole series; an  adventure, too, that has for me the added interest that it inaugurated  my permanent association with my learned and talented friend, and marked  the close of a rather unhappy and unprosperous period of my life.    Memory, retracing the journey through the passing years to the  starting-point of those strange events, lands me in a shabby little  ground-floor room in a house near the Walworth end of Lower Kennington  Lane. A couple of framed diplomas on the wall, a card of Snellen's  test-types and a stethoscope lying on the writing-table, proclaim it a  doctor's consulting-room; and my own position in the round-backed chair  at the said table, proclaims me the practitioner in charge.    It was nearly nine o'clock. The noisy little clock on the mantelpiece  announced the fact, and, by its frantic ticking, seemed as anxious as I  to get the consultation hours over. I glanced wistfully at my  mud-splashed boots and wondered if I might yet venture to assume the  slippers that peeped coyly from under the shabby sofa. I even allowed my  thoughts to wander to the pipe that reposed in my coat pocket. Another  minute and I could turn down the surgery gas and shut the outer door.  The fussy little clock gave a sort of preliminary cough or hiccup, as if  it should say: \"Ahem! ladies and gentlemen, I am about to strike.\" And  at that moment, the bottle-boy opened the door and, thrusting in his  head, uttered the one word: \"Gentleman.\"    Extreme economy of words is apt to result in ambiguity. But I  understood. In Kennington Lane, the race of mere men and women appeared  to be extinct. They were all gentlemen--unless they were ladies or  children--even as the Liberian army was said to consist entirely of  generals. Sweeps, labourers, milkmen, costermongers--all were  impartially invested by the democratic bottle-boy with the rank and  title of <i>armigeri</i>. The present nobleman appeared to favour the  aristocratic recreation of driving a cab or job-master's carriage, and,  as he entered the room, he touched his hat, closed the door somewhat  carefully, and then, without remark, handed me a note which bore the  superscription \"Dr. Stillbury.\"    \"You understand,\" I said, as I prepared to open the envelope, \"that I  am not Dr. Stillbury. He is away at present and I am looking after his  patients.\"    \"It doesn't signify,\" the man replied. \"You'll do as well.\"    On this, I opened the envelope and read the note, which was quite brief,  and, at first sight, in no way remarkable.    \"DEAR SIR,\" it ran, \"Would you kindly come and see a friend of mine who  is staying with me? The bearer of this will give you further particulars  and convey you to the house. Yours truly, H. WEISS.\"    There was no address on the paper and no date, and the writer was  unknown to me.    \"This note,\" I said, \"refers to some further particulars. What are  they?\"    The messenger passed his hand over his hair with a gesture of  embarrassment. \"It's a ridicklus affair,\" he said, with a contemptuous  laugh. \"If I had been Mr. Weiss, I wouldn't have had nothing to do with  it. The sick gentleman, Mr. Graves, is one of them people what can't  abear doctors. He's been ailing now for a week or two, but nothing would  induce him to see a doctor. Mr. Weiss did everything he could to  persuade him, but it was no go. He wouldn't. However, it seems Mr. Weiss  threatened to send for a medical man on his own account, because, you  see, he was getting a bit nervous; and then Mr. Graves gave way. But  only on one condition. He said the doctor was to come from a distance  and was not to be told who he was or where he lived or anything about  him; and he made Mr. Weiss promise to keep to that condition before he'd  let him send. So Mr. Weiss promised, and, of course, he's got to keep  his word.\"    \"But,\" I said, with a smile, \"you've just told me his name--if his name  really is Graves.\"    \"You can form your own opinion on that,\" said the coachman.    \"And,\" I added, \"as to not being told where he lives, I can see that for  myself. I'm not blind, you know.\"    \"We'll take the risk of what you see,\" the man replied. \"The question  is, will you take the job on?\"    Yes; that was the question, and I considered it for some time before  replying. We medical men are pretty familiar with the kind of person who  \"can't abear doctors,\" and we like to have as little to do with him as  possible. He is a thankless and unsatisfactory patient. Intercourse with  him is unpleasant, he gives a great deal of trouble and responds badly  to treatment. If this had been my own practice, I should have declined  the case off-hand. But it was not my practice. I was only a deputy. I  could not lightly refuse work which would yield a profit to my  principal, unpleasant though it might be.    As I turned the matter over in my mind, I half unconsciously scrutinized  my visitor--somewhat to his embarrassment--and I liked his appearance  as little as I liked his mission. He kept his station near the door,  where the light was dim--for the illumination was concentrated on the  table and the patient's chair--but I could see that he had a somewhat  sly, unprepossessing face and a greasy, red moustache that seemed out of  character with his rather perfunctory livery; though this was mere  prejudice. He wore a wig, too--not that there was anything discreditable  in that--and the thumb-nail of the hand that held his hat bore  disfiguring traces of some injury--which, again, though unsightly, in no  wise reflected on his moral character. Lastly, he watched me keenly with  a mixture of anxiety and sly complacency that I found distinctly  unpleasant. In a general way, he impressed me disagreeably. I did not  like the look of him at all; but nevertheless I decided to undertake the  case.    \"I suppose,\" I answered, at length, \"it is no affair of mine who the  patient is or where he lives. But how do you propose to manage the  business? Am I to be led to the house blindfolded, like the visitor to  the bandit's cave?\"    The man grinned slightly and looked very decidedly relieved.    \"No, sir,\" he answered; \"we ain't going to blindfold you. I've got a  carriage outside. I don't think you'll see much out of that.\"    \"Very well,\" I rejoined, opening the door to let him out, \"I'll be with  you in a minute. I suppose you can't give me any idea as to what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team            THE LONG SHADOW          BY B.M.

Charming Billy, hearing  the crooning wail of it, knew well the portent and sighed. Perhaps he,  too, felt something of the desolateness without and perhaps he, too,  longed for some human companionship.    He sent a glance of half-conscious disapproval around the untidy  cabin. He had been dreaming aimlessly of a place he had seen not so  long ago; a place where the stove was black and shining, with a fire  crackling cheeringly inside and a teakettle with straight, unmarred  spout and dependable handle singing placidly to itself and puffing  steam with an air of lazy comfort, as if it were smoking a cigarette.  The stove had stood in the southwest corner of the room, and the room  was warm with the heat of it; and the floor was white and had a strip  of rag carpet reaching from the table to a corner of the stove. There  was a red cloth with knotted fringe on the table, and a bed in another  corner had a red-and-white patchwork spread and puffy white pillows.  There had been a woman--but Charming Billy shut his eyes, mentally, to  the woman, because he was not accustomed to them and he was not at  all sure that he wanted to be accustomed; they did not fit in with the  life he lived. He felt dimly that, in a way, they were like the  heaven his mother had taught him--altogether perfect and altogether  unattainable and not to be thought of with any degree of familiarity.  So his memory of the woman was indistinct, as of something which did  not properly belong to the picture. He clung instead to the memory of  the warm stove, and the strip of carpet, and the table with the red  cloth, and to the puffy, white pillows on the bed.    The wind mourned again insistently at the corner. Billy lifted  his head and looked once more around the cabin. The reality was  depressing--doubly depressing in contrast to the memory of that other  room. A stove stood in the southwest corner, but it was not black  and shining; it was rust-red and ash-littered, and the ashes had  overflowed the hearth and spilled to the unswept floor. A dented  lard-pail without a handle did meagre duty as a teakettle, and  balanced upon a corner of the stove was a dirty frying pan. The fire  had gone dead and the room was chill with the rising of the wind.  The table was filled with empty cans and tin plates and cracked,  oven-stained bowls and iron-handled knives and forks, and the bunk in  the corner was a tumble of gray blankets and unpleasant, red-flowered  comforts--corner-wads, Charming Billy was used to calling them--and  for pillows there were two square, calico-covered cushions,  depressingly ugly in pattern and not over-clean.    Billy sighed again, threaded a needle with coarse, black thread and  attacked petulantly a long rent in his coat. \"Darn this bushwhacking  all over God's earth after a horse a man can't stay with, nor even  hold by the bridle reins,\" he complained dispiritedly. \"I could uh  cleaned the blamed shack up so it would look like folks was living  here--and I woulda, if I didn't have to set all day and toggle up the  places in my clothes\"--Billy muttered incoherently over a knot in his  thread. \"I've been plumb puzzled, all winter, to know whether it's man  or cattle I'm supposed to chappyrone. If it's man, this coat has sure  got the marks uh the trade, all right.\" He drew the needle spitefully  through the cloth.    The wind gathered breath and swooped down upon the cabin so that  Billy felt the jar of it. \"I don't see what's got the matter of the  weather,\" he grumbled. \"Yuh just get a chinook that starts water  running down the coulees, and then the wind switches and she freezes  up solid--and that means tailing-up poor cows and calves by the  dozen--and for your side-partner yuh get dealt out to yuh a pilgrim  that don't know nothing and can't ride a wagon seat, hardly, and  that's bound to keep a _dawg_! And the Old Man stands for that kind uh  thing and has forbid accidents happening to it--oh, hell!\"    This last was inspired by a wriggling movement under the bunk. A black  dog, of the apologetic drooping sort that always has its tail sagging  and matted with burrs, crawled out and sidled past Billy with a  deprecating wag or two when he caught his unfriendly glance, and  shambled over to the door that he might sniff suspiciously the cold  air coming in through the crack beneath.    Billy eyed him malevolently. \"A dog in a line-camp is a plumb  disgrace! I don't see why the Old Man stands for it--or the Pilgrim,  either; it's a toss-up which is the worst. Yuh smell him coming, do  yuh?\" he snarled. \"It's about _time_ he was coming--me here eating  dried apricots and tapioca steady diet (nobody but a pilgrim would  fetch tapioca into a line-camp, and if he does it again you'll sure  be missing the only friend yuh got) and him gone four days when he'd  oughta been back the second. Get out and welcome him, darn yuh!\"  He gathered the coat under one arm that he might open the door, and  hurried the dog outside with a threatening boot toe. The wind whipped  his brown cheeks so that he closed the door hastily and retired to the  cheerless shelter of the cabin.    \"Another blizzard coming, if I know the signs. And if the Pilgrim  don't show up to-night with the grub and tobacco--But I reckon the  dawg smelt him coming, all right.\" He fingered uncertainly a very  flabby tobacco sack, grew suddenly reckless and made himself an  exceedingly thin cigarette with the remaining crumbs of tobacco  and what little he could glean from the pockets of the coat he was  mending. Surely, the Pilgrim would remember his tobacco! Incapable  as he was, he could scarcely forget that, after the extreme emphasis  Charming Billy had laid upon the getting, and the penalties attached  to its oversight.    Outside, the dog was barking spasmodically; but Billy, being a product  of the cattle industry pure and simple, knew not the way of dogs.  He took it for granted that the Pilgrim was arriving with the grub,  though he was too disgusted with his delay to go out and make sure.  Dogs always barked at everything impartially--when they were not  gnawing surreptitiously at bones or snooping in corners for scraps,  or planting themselves deliberately upon your clothes. Even when the  noise subsided to throaty growls he failed to recognize the symptoms;  he was taking long, rapturous mouthfuls of smoke and gazing dreamily  at his coat, for it was his first cigarette since yesterday.    When some one rapped lightly he jumped, although he was not a man who  owned unsteady nerves. It was very unusual, that light tapping. When  any one wanted to come in he always opened the door without further  ceremony. Still, there was no telling what strange freak might impel  the Pilgrim--he who insisted on keeping a dog in a line-camp!--so  Billy recovered himself and called out impatiently: \"Aw, come on in!  Don't be a plumb fool,\" and never moved from his place.    The door opened queerly; slowly, and with a timidity not at all in  keeping with the blundering assertiveness of the Pilgrim. When a young  woman showed for a moment against the bleak twilight and then stepped  inside, Charming Billy caught at the table for support, and the coat  he was holding dropped to the floor. He did not say a word: he just  stared.    The girl closed the door behind her with something of defiance,  that did not in the least impose upon one. \"Good evening,\" she said  briskly, though even in his chaotic state of mind Billy felt the  tremble in her voice. \"It's rather late for making calls, but--\" She  stopped and caught her breath nervously, as if she found it impossible  to go on being brisk and at ease. \"I was riding, and my horse slipped  and hurt himself so he couldn't walk, and I saw this cabin from up on  the hill over there. So I came here, because it was so far home--and I  thought--maybe--\" She looked with big, appealing brown eyes at Billy,  who felt himself a brute without in the least knowing why. \"I'm Flora  Bridger; you know, my father has taken up a ranch over on Shell Creek,  and--\"    \"I'm very glad to meet you,\" said Charming Billy stammeringly. \"Won't  you sit down? I--I wish I'd known company was coming.\" He smiled  reassuringly, and then glanced frowningly around"]]]
