STRAHAN, PRINTERS-STREET,    FOR T. CADELL JUN. AND W. DAVIES, IN THE STRAND.    1802.    * * * * *    TO  THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  ROBERT LORD HOBART    His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War Department,  One of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, etc.    MY LORD,    Feeling myself highly flattered by your permission to inscribe the  following pages to your Lordship, I now humbly presume to offer them to  your perusal.    The colonists of New South Wales will feel with me, who must ever take an  interest in the welfare of the settlement, a high degree of satisfaction  at finding the conduct of their affairs placed under the direction of a  nobleman who has dignified the amiable virtues of private life by the  acquisition of those more splendid talents which characterise a  consummate statesman; thus at once rendering himself the object of  veneration and of gratitude to his country.    Your Lordship's services in the several high and important situations  which you have filled, are too generally known, and too well remembered,  to make me apprehensive lest my humble tribute of applause should be  mistaken for other than the genuine feelings of one proud of this  opportunity to unite his voice with that of a grateful nation.    The settlement whose annalist I have been has had much to struggle with.  Its distance from the protecting wing of the parent government, and the  unprecedented war which that government, has so long had to conduct, have  very much repressed its energies, and detracted from its natural vigour.  But, although the distance must ever remain an obstacle, yet now, that  your Lordship can uninterruptedly afford a portion of your valuable time  and great abilities to the consideration of its interests, it will, I  trust, be found to correct its bad habits, and to maintain, with a degree  of respectability, its place among the colonial dominions of our much  beloved and most gracious Sovereign.    That your Lordship may long be permitted to dispense blessings to New  South Wales and other distant countries, and to assist, instruct, and  adorn your own, is the ardent and anxious wish of him who has the honour  to be, with every sentiment of respect,    MY LORD,  Your Lordship's  Most obedient, very humble,  and devoted servant,  DAVID COLLINS    Beaumont Street,  June 26, 1802    * * * * *    ADVERTISEMENT    London, 17th June 1802    The very flattering reception which my former _Account of the English  Colony in New South Wales_ experienced from a candid and liberal  public, has induced me to continue my labours in the character of its  historian; having been favoured with materials for this purpose, on the  authenticity of which I can safely stake my credit.    Should the reader feel wearied with the detail of crimes and their  consequences, the fault lies not with me. I have only to regret that a  soil of so much promise has not produced better fruit. Such as there was,  I have diligently gathered; and have endeavoured to render it as  palatable as the nature of it would allow me. When we reflect that the  exotics with which this new plantation is supplied are chiefly the refuse  of our domestic nurseries; and duly consider that, however beneficial the  act of transplantation may finally be found, it must for a time retard  the growth, and will generally protract the fruit for a season, however  fertile the original stock, we ought, perhaps, considerably to moderate  our expectations. By patient culture, skillfully directed, in a climate so  propitious, and a soil so favourable, much may yet be effected: after  experience shall have once thoroughly ascertained all the dangers and  difficulties necessary to be surmounted, before most judicious  cultivators can completely avail themselves of the many local advantages  of which the situation is undoubtedly susceptible.    To relieve the mind as much as possible from the contemplation of  enormities, and the disgustingly wretched picture which vice must ever  exhibit, I have not only interspersed a few notices of rare and curious  objects in Natural History peculiar to the Australian regions; but have  also inserted the two voyages which were made in the little sloop  Norfolk, by Captain Flinders and Mr. Bass, in the order of time in which  they occurred, instead of placing them in an Appendix.    The Natives too have contributed to assist me in this part of my  undertaking; and some additional light is thrown upon their peculiar  manners and customs in the course of the work. It were to be wished, that  they never had been seen in any other state than that which the subjoined  view of them presents, in the happy and peaceable exercise of their  freedom and amusements.    * * * * *    CONTENTS    CHAPTER I    Recapitulation  A log prison begun  Various impositions practised at the store  October  Regulations and proceedings of the governor  A man found dead  A woman murdered  Discontents among the Irish, followed by an order  Character of the settlers at the river  Houses numbered at Sydney  Bennillong claims protection from the governor  Weather in October  November  Two victuallers arrive from England  Constables elected  The _Francis_ returns from Norfolk Island  Civil appointment  A criminal court held  Executions  One man hung in chains  Effect of this upon the natives  Public works  December  Convicts secreted on board the _Sylph_  Reflections  A general muster  Regulations  A native child murdered  Weather    CHAPTER II    The governor visits Richmond-Hill  His transactions there  A stack of wheat burnt  Sawyers punished  Price of labour regulated  General character of the settlers  The clergyman's attention to the children  Criminal court assembled  Lawrence Davoran  The governor goes to Botany Bay  George's river  Public works  Lightning and its effects    CHAPTER III    The wind-mill tried  A civil court assembled  Difficulty respecting the convicts from Ireland  The natives  Some buildings begun  Weather March  Number of men not victualled by the Commissary, who had been convicts  An extraordinary theft  Court of criminal judicature twice held  One man suffers death  Price of labour fixed  The natives attack the settlers  Public works  Weather    CHAPTER IV    Report revived of a white woman being with the natives  A shoal seen  Some civil regulations  Natives troublesome  The governor goes on an excursion  Particulars thereof  A valuable tree discovered  Weather  May  The natives burn a house  Consequences  The Supply arrives from the Cape  A ship wrecked to the southward  Three of her people brought in by a fishing boat  Particulars  Two accidents  The _Britannia_ arrives from England  Vessels and assistance sent to the wreck  Public works  Cordage wanted  The _Mercury_ sails  June  The Ganges arrives from Ireland  Transactions  Some runaways taken and brought to trial  The _Reliance_ arrives from the Cape  A strange desertion  Public works  New gaol finished    CHAPTER V    The _Francis_ returns from the wreck of the _Sydney Cove_  The _Eliza_ long-boat missing  Gale of wind  Cattle from the Cape landed  Station altered  Public works  An officer dies  Accident on board the _Schooner_  The ships sail for China  Coal discovered  Natives  Bennillong  Courts Of justice assembled  The _Supply_ condemned  The _Cumberland_ seized and carried off to sea  Is pursued, but not retaken  More coal found; and a new river  The people left by Capt.

The sea is below the  car!

Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast,  in the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without  intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were  terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen  hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the  thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were  overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of  water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which  the published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled  by waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several  thousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces  of its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters  those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th  of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.    But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a  drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.    In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a  waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of  air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning  round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.    Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five  passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled  with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.    Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From  what part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started  during the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the  first symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that  the balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled  less than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.    At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,  could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed  since their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the  very midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They  were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the  rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were  removed from a horizontal position.    Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered  beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density  of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or  night. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring  of the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while  suspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had  informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However,  the balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and  provisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a  height of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea  extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than  those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful  articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life  of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.    The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to  less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest  began to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March,  it showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had  risen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind  had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate  of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It  was still what sailors call \"a close-reefed topsail breeze,\" but the  commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.    Towards eleven o'clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly  clearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt  after the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone  farther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have  passed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to  the typhoons of the Indian Ocean?    But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again  slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,  little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and  extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the  balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It  contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it  could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a  great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.    Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles  which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept,  everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted  himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to  secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.    It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and  that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.  They must infallibly perish!    There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.  The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid  surface upon which their anchor could hold.    It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous  violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those  whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of  forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,  appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and  disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not  a solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest  their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in  the waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.  But, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the  same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of  the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.    Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were  evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were  useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas  escaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was  visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet  of the ocean.    It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a  large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which  it contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension  in the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only  be retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and  balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.    They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly  dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single  murmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the  last minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a  sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest  possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.    Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the  water.    At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was  inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not  less determined. \"Is everything thrown out?\" \"No, here are still 2,000  dollars in gold.\" A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. \"Does  the balloon rise?\" \"A little, but it will not be long before it falls  again.\" \"What still remains to be thrown out?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Yes! the  car!\" \"Let us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.\"    This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.  The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,  mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the  net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.    The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to  throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical  position. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical  precision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of  any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So  it happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant  aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent  which it was impossible to repair.    The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them  now.    They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.    At four o'clo"]]]
