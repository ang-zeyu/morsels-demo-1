The Battle-Pieces in this volume are dedicated to the memory of the  THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND who in the war for the maintenance of the Union  fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers.        [With few exceptions, the Pieces in this volume originated in an impulse  imparted by the fall of Richmond. They were composed without reference  to collective arrangement, but being brought together in review,  naturally fall into the order assumed.    The events and incidents of the conflict--making up a whole, in varied  amplitude, corresponding with the geographical area covered by the  war--from these but a few themes have been taken, such as for any cause  chanced to imprint themselves upon the mind.    The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are  the moods of involuntary meditation--moods variable, and at times widely  at variance. Yielding instinctively, one after another, to feelings not  inspired from any one source exclusively, and unmindful, without  purposing to be, of consistency, I seem, in most of these verses, to  have but placed a harp in a window, and noted the contrasted airs which  wayward wilds have played upon the strings.]        The Portent.  (1859.)      Hanging from the beam,    Slowly swaying (such the law),  Gaunt the shadow on your green,    Shenandoah!  The cut is on the crown  (Lo, John Brown),  And the stabs shall heal no more.    Hidden in the cap    Is the anguish none can draw;  So your future veils its face,    Shenandoah!  But the streaming beard is shown  (Weird John Brown),  The meteor of the the war.        Misgivings.  (1860.)        When ocean-clouds over inland hills      Sweep storming in late autumn brown,    And horror the sodden valley fills,      And the spire falls crashing in the town,    I muse upon my country's ills--    The tempest bursting from the waste of Time  On the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime.      Nature's dark side is heeded now--      (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)--    A child may read the moody brow      Of yon black mountain lone.    With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,    And storms are formed behind the storm we feel:  The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.        The Conflict of Convictions.[1]  (1860-1.)      On starry heights    A bugle wails the long recall;  Derision stirs the deep abyss,    Heaven's ominous silence over all.  Return, return, O eager Hope,    And face man's latter fall.  Events, they make the dreamers quail;  Satan's old age is strong and hale,  A disciplined captain, gray in skill,  And Raphael a white enthusiast still;  Dashed aims, at which Christ's martyrs pale,  Shall Mammon's slaves fulfill?        (_Dismantle the fort,      Cut down the fleet--      Battle no more shall be!      While the fields for fight in aeons to come      Congeal beneath the sea._)    The terrors of truth and dart of death    To faith alike are vain;  Though comets, gone a thousand years,      Return again,  Patient she stands--she can no more--  And waits, nor heeds she waxes hoar.        (_At a stony gate,      A statue of stone,      Weed overgrown--      Long 'twill wait!_)    But God his former mind retains,    Confirms his old decree;  The generations are inured to pains,    And strong Necessity  Surges, and heaps Time's strand with wrecks.    The People spread like a weedy grass,    The thing they will they bring to pass,  And prosper to the apoplex.  The rout it herds around the heart,    The ghost is yielded in the gloom;  Kings wag their heads--Now save thyself    Who wouldst rebuild the world in bloom.        (_Tide-mark      And top of the ages' strike,      Verge where they called the world to come,      The last advance of life--      Ha ha, the rust on the Iron Dome!_)    Nay, but revere the hid event;    In the cloud a sword is girded on,  I mark a twinkling in the tent    Of Michael the warrior one.  Senior wisdom suits not now,  The light is on the youthful brow.        (_Ay, in caves the miner see:      His forehead bears a blinking light;      Darkness so he feebly braves--      A meagre wight!_)    But He who rules is old--is old;  Ah! faith is warm, but heaven with age is cold.        (_Ho ho, ho ho,      The cloistered doubt      Of olden times      Is blurted out!_)    The Ancient of Days forever is young,    Forever the scheme of Nature thrives;  I know a wind in purpose strong--    It spins _against_ the way it drives.  What if the gulfs their slimed foundations bare?  So deep must the stones be hurled  Whereon the throes of ages rear  The final empire and the happier world.        (_The poor old Past,      The Future's slave,      She drudged through pain and crime      To bring about the blissful Prime,      Then--perished. There's a grave!_)      Power unanointed may come--  Dominion (unsought by the free)    And the Iron Dome,  Stronger for stress and strain,  Fling her huge shadow athwart the main;  But the Founders' dream shall flee.  Agee after age shall be  As age after age has been,  (From man's changeless heart their way they win);    And death be busy with all who strive--  Death, with silent negative.        YEA, AND NAY--      EACH HATH HIS SAY;      BUT GOD HE KEEPS THE MIDDLE WAY.      NONE WAS BY      WHEN HE SPREAD THE SKY;      WISDOM IS VAIN, AND PROPHESY.        Apathy and Enthusiasm.  (1860-1.)      I    O the clammy cold November,    And the winter white and dead,  And the terror dumb with stupor,    And the sky a sheet of lead;  And events that came resounding    With the cry that _All was lost_,  Like the thunder-cracks of massy ice    In intensity of frost--  Bursting one upon another    Through the horror of the calm.    The paralysis of arm  In the anguish of the heart;  And the hollowness and dearth.    The appealings of the mother    To brother and to brother  Not in hatred so to part--  And the fissure in the hearth    Growing momently more wide.  Then the glances 'tween the Fates,    And the doubt on every side,  And the patience under gloom  In the stoniness that waits  The finality of doom.      II    So the winter died despairing,    And the weary weeks of Lent;  And the ice-bound rivers melted,    And the tomb of Faith was rent.  O, the rising of the People    Came with springing of the grass,  They rebounded from dejection    And Easter came to pass.  And the young were all elation    Hearing Sumter's cannon roar,  And they thought how tame the Nation    In the age that went before.  And Michael seemed gigantical,    The Arch-fiend but a dwarf;  And at the towers of Erebus    Our striplings flung the scoff.  But the elders with foreboding    Mourned the days forever o'er,  And re called the forest proverb,    The Iroquois' old saw:  _Grief to every graybeard    When young Indians lead the war._        The March into Virginia,  Ending in the First Manassas.  (July, 1861.)      Did all the lets and bars appear    To every just or larger end,  Whence should come the trust and cheer?    Youth must its ignorant impulse lend--  Age finds place in the rear.    All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys,  The champions and enthusiasts of the state:    Turbid ardors and vain joys      Not barrenly abate--    Stimulants to the power mature,      Preparatives of fate.    Who here forecasteth the event?  What heart but spurns at precedent  And warnings of the wise,  Contemned foreclosures of surprise?    The banners play, the bugles call,  The air is blue and prodigal.    No berrying party, pleasure-wooed,  No picnic party in the May,  Ever went less loth than they    Into that leafy neighborhood.  In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate,  Moloch's uninitiate;  Expectancy, and glad surmise  Of battle's unknown mysteries.  All they feel is this: 'tis glory,  A rapture sharp, though transitory,  Yet lasting in belaureled story.  So they gayly go to fight,  Chatting left and laughing right.    But some who this blithe mood present,    As on in lightsome files they fare,  Shall die experienced ere three days are spent--    Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare;  Or shame survive, and, like to adamant,    The throe of Second Manassas share.        Lyon.  Battle of Springfield, Missouri.  (August, 1861.)      Some hearts there are of deeper sort,      Prophetic, sad,  Which yet for cause are trebly clad;      Known death they fly on:  This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon.    \"They are more than twenty thousand strong,      We less than five,  Too few with such a host to strive\"      \"Such counsel, fie on!  'Tis battle, or 'tis shame;\" and firm stood Lyon.    \"For help at need in van we wait--      Retreat or fight:  Retreat the foe would take for flight,      And each proud scion  Feel more elate; the end must come,\" said Lyon.    By candlelight he wrote the will,      And left his all  To Her for whom 'twas not enough to fall;      Loud neighed Orion  Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon.    The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale      With guard-fires lit;  Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it:      \"A field to die on\"  Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon.    We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn--      Fate seemed malign;  His horse the Leader led along the line--      Star-browed Orion;  Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon.    There came a sound like the slitting of air      By a swift sharp sword--  A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad      Of black Orion  Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon.    \"General, you're hurt--this sleet of balls!\"      He seemed half spent;  With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent:      \"The field to die on;  But not--not yet; the day is long,\" breathed Lyon.    For a time becharmed there fell a lull      In the heart of the fight;  The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light;      Warm noon-winds sigh on,  And "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12389"],[0,"Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics (#1)"],[1,"Team.            SAPPHO      ONE HUNDRED LYRICS  BY  BLISS CARMAN        1907          \"SAPPHO WHO BROKE OFF A FRAGMENT OF HER SOUL  FOR US TO GUESS AT.\"      \"SAPPHO, WITH THAT GLORIOLE  OF EBON HAIR ON CALMED BROWS--  O POET-WOMAN! NONE FORGOES  THE LEAP, ATTAINING THE REPOSE.\"        E.B. BROWNING.          INTRODUCTION    THE POETRY OF SAPPHO.--If all the poets and all the lovers of poetry should  be asked to name the most precious of the priceless things which time has  wrung in tribute from the triumphs of human genius, the answer which would  rush to every tongue would be \"The Lost Poems of Sappho.\" These we know to  have been jewels of a radiance so imperishable that the broken gleams of  them still dazzle men's eyes, whether shining from the two small brilliants  and the handful of star-dust which alone remain to us, or reflected merely  from the adoration of those poets of old time who were so fortunate as to  witness their full glory.    For about two thousand five hundred years Sappho has held her place as not  only the supreme poet of her sex, but the chief lyrist of all lyrists.  Every one who reads acknowledges her fame, concedes her supremacy; but to  all except poets and Hellenists her name is a vague and uncomprehended  splendour, rising secure above a persistent mist of misconception. In spite  of all that is in these days being written about Sappho, it is perhaps not  out of place now to inquire, in a few words, into the substance of this  supremacy which towers so unassailably secure from what appear to be such  shadowy foundations.    First, we have the witness of her contemporaries. Sappho was at the height  of her career about six centuries before Christ, at a period when lyric  poetry was peculiarly esteemed and cultivated at the centres of Greek life.  Among the _Molic_ peoples of the Isles, in particular, it had been carried  to a high pitch of perfection, and its forms had become the subject of  assiduous study. Its technique was exact, complex, extremely elaborate,  minutely regulated; yet the essential fires of sincerity, spontaneity,  imagination and passion were flaming with undiminished heat behind the  fixed forms and restricted measures. The very metropolis of this lyric  realm was Mitylene of Lesbos, where, amid the myrtle groves and temples,  the sunlit silver of the fountains, the hyacinth gardens by a soft blue  sea, Beauty and Love in their young warmth could fuse the most rigid forms  to fluency. Here Sappho was the acknowledged queen of song--revered,  studied, imitated, served, adored by a little court of attendants and  disciples, loved and hymned by Alcaeus, and acclaimed by her fellow  craftsmen throughout Greece as the wonder of her age. That all the tributes  of her contemporaries show reverence not less for her personality than for  her genius is sufficient answer to the calumnies with which the ribald  jesters of that later period, the corrupt and shameless writers of Athenian  comedy, strove to defile her fame. It is sufficient, also, to warrant our  regarding the picturesque but scarcely dignified story of her vain pursuit  of Phaon and her frenzied leap from the Cliff of Leucas as nothing more  than a poetic myth, reminiscent, perhaps, of the myth of Aphrodite and  Adonis--who is, indeed, called Phaon in some versions. The story is further  discredited by the fact that we find no mention of it in Greek literature--  even among those Attic comedians who would have clutched at it so eagerly  and given it so gross a turn--till a date more than two hundred years after  Sappho's death. It is a myth which has begotten some exquisite literature,  both in prose and verse, from Ovid's famous epistle to Addison's gracious  fantasy and some impassioned and imperishable dithyrambs of Mr. Swinburne;  but one need not accept the story as a fact in order to appreciate the  beauties which flowered out from its coloured unreality.    The applause of contemporaries, however, is not always justified by the  verdict of after-times, and does not always secure an immortality of  renown. The fame of Sappho has a more stable basis. Her work was in the  world's possession for not far short of a thousand years--a thousand years  of changing tastes, searching criticism, and familiar use. It had to endure  the wear and tear of quotation, the commonizing touch of the school and the  market-place. And under this test its glory grew ever more and more  conspicuous. Through those thousand years poets and critics vied with one  another in proclaiming her verse the one unmatched exemplar of lyric art.  Such testimony, even though not a single fragment remained to us from which  to judge her poetry for ourselves, might well convince us that the  supremacy acknowledged by those who knew all the triumphs of the genius of  old Greece was beyond the assault of any modern rival. We might safely  accept the sustained judgment of a thousand years of Greece.    Fortunately for us, however, two small but incomparable odes and a few  scintillating fragments have survived, quoted and handed down in the  eulogies of critics and expositors. In these the wisest minds, the greatest  poets, and the most inspired teachers of modern days have found  justification for the unanimous verdict of antiquity. The tributes of  Addison, Tennyson, and others, the throbbing paraphrases and ecstatic  interpretations of Swinburne, are too well known to call for special  comment in this brief note; but the concise summing up of her genius by Mr.  Watts-Dunton in his remarkable essay on poetry is so convincing and  illuminating that it seems to demand quotation here: \"Never before these  songs were sung, and never since did the human soul, in the grip of a fiery  passion, utter a cry like hers; and, from the executive point of view, in  directness, in lucidity, in that high, imperious verbal economy which only  nature can teach the artist, she has no equal, and none worthy to take the  place of second.\"    The poems of Sappho so mysteriously lost to us seem to have consisted of at  least nine books of odes, together with _epithalamia_, epigrams,  elegies, and monodies. Of the several theories which have been advanced to  account for their disappearance, the most plausible seems to be that which  represents them as having been burned at Byzantium in the year 380 Anno  Domini, by command of Gregory Nazianzen, in order that his own poems might  be studied in their stead and the morals of the people thereby improved. Of  the efficacy of this act no means of judging has come down to us.    In recent years there has arisen a great body of literature upon the  subject of Sappho, most of it the abstruse work of scholars writing for  scholars. But the gist of it all, together with the minutest surviving  fragment of her verse, has been made available to the general reader in  English by Mr. Henry T. Wharton, in whose altogether admirable little  volume we find all that is known and the most apposite of all that has been  said up to the present day about      \"Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song,    Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love.\"    Perhaps the most perilous and the most alluring venture in the whole field  of poetry is that which Mr. Carman has undertaken in attempting to give us  in English verse those lost poems of Sappho of which fragments have  survived. The task is obviously not one of translation or of paraphrasing,  but of imaginative and, at the same time, interpretive construction. It is  as if a sculptor of to-day were to set himself, with reverence, and trained  craftsmanship, and studious familiarity with the spirit, technique, and  atmosphere of his subject, to restore some statues of Polyclitus or  Praxiteles of which he had but a broken arm, a foot, a knee, a finger upon  which to build. Mr. Carman's method, apparently, has been to imagine each  lost lyric as discovered, and then to translate it; for the indefinable  flavour of the translation is maintained throughout, though accompanied by  the fluidity and freedom of purely original work.
