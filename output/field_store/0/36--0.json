VOL. 13, No. 350.] SATURDAY, JANUARY 3, 1829. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          BRUCE CASTLE, TOTTENHAM.    [Illustration: BRUCE CASTLE, TOTTENHAM.]      The engraving represents this interesting structure, as it appeared in  the year 1686; being copied from a print, after a picture by Wolridge.    The original castle was very ancient, as appears by the foundations, and  an old brick tower over a deep well, the upper part of which has been  used as a dairy. The castle is said to have been built by Earl Waltheof,  who, in 1069 married Judith, niece to William the Conqueror, who gave  him the earldom of Northampton and Huntingdon for her portion. Matilda  or Maud, their only child, after the death of Simon St. Liz, her first  husband, married David, first of the name, king of Scotland; and Maud,  being heiress of Huntingdon, had in her own right, as an appendix to  that honour, the manor of Tottenham in Middlesex.    Robert Bruce, grandson of David, Earl of Huntingdon, and grandfather to  Robert I. of Scotland, memorable as the restorer of the independence of  his country, became one of the competitors for the crown of Scotland in  1290, but being superseded by John Baliol, Bruce retired to England, and  settled at his grandfather's estate at Tottenham, repaired the castle,  and acquiring another manor, called it and the castle after his own  name. Shakspeare says,      Fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns,    and the fortunes of the two Bruces are \"confirmation strong as holy  writ.\"    The estate being forfeited to the crown, it had different proprietors,  till 1631, when it was in the possession of Hugh Hare, Lord Coleraine.  Henry Hare, the last Lord Coleraine of that family, having been deserted  by his wife, who obstinately refused, for twenty years, to return to  him, formed a connexion with Miss Roze Duplessis, a French lady, by whom  he had a daughter, born in Italy, whom he named Henrietta Roza  Peregrina, and to whom he left all his estates. This lady married the  late Mr. Alderman Townsend; but, being an alien, she could not take the  estates; and the will being legally made, barred the heirs at law; so  that the estate escheated to the crown. However, a grant of these  estates, confirmed by act of parliament, was made to Mr. Townsend and  his lady, whose son, Henry Hare Townsend, Esq. in 1792, voluntarily sold  the property for the payment of the family debts; and \"although the  castle may soon be levelled with the ground, yet the destruction of this  ancient fabric will acquire him more honour, than if the prudence of his  ancestors had enabled him to restore the three towers, of which now only  one remains.\"[1]        [1] Gough's Camden.    The present mansion is partly ancient, and partly modern, and was very  lately the property of Sir William Curtis, Bart. Up to the period at  which the castle is represented in the engraving, the building must have  undergone many alterations, as the tower on the left, and the two  octagonal and centre towers, will prove. The grounds there appear laid  out in the trim fashion of the seventeenth century, and ornamented with  fountains, vases, &c.             *       *       *       *       *    NEW YEAR'S CUSTOM.    _(For the Mirror.)_      BROMLEY PAGETS, Staffordshire, is 129 miles from London, and is a pretty  town on the skirts of Derbyshire. This place is remarkable, or was  lately, for a sport on New Year's Day and Twelfth Day, called _The  Hobby-Horse Dance_, from a person who rode upon the image of a horse,  with a bow and arrow in his hands, with which he made a snapping noise,  and kept time to the music, while six men danced the hay and other  country dances, with as many deer's heads on their shoulders. To this  hobby-horse belonged a pot, which the reeves of the town kept filled  with cakes and ale, towards which the spectators contributed a penny,  and with the remainder they maintained their poor and repaired the  church.

Sound, sound the charge when the foe is before us,      When the visors are closed and the lances are down,    If we fall, let the banner of victory o'er us      Dance time to thy clarion that sings our renown:    To the souls of the valiant no requiem is given,    So fit as thine echoes, to soothe them in heaven.

Take a chair, my old boy--while our glasses we fill,    And tell us, \"what news\"--for you can if you will.      Shall we have any war? or will there be peace?    Will swindlers, as usual, the credulous fleece?    Will the season produce us a _deluge_ of rain?    Did the comet bring coughs and catarrhs in his train?      Will gas, so delicious, _perfume_ our abodes?    Will McAdam continue \"Colossus of _roads?_\"    Will Venus's boy be abroad with his bow,    And make the dear girls over bachelors crow?      Will _quid-nuncs_ from scandalous whispers refrain?    Will poets the pent of Parnassus attain?    Will travellers' tomes touch the truth to a T?    Will critics from caustic coercion be free?      Shall we check crafty care in his cunning career?    In short--shall we welcome a happy new year?    What, _mum_, Father Janus?--egad I suppose,    Not one of our queries you mean to disclose.      Let us, therefore, the blessings which Providence sends,    To our country, to us, our relations and friends,    With gratitude own--and employ the supplies,    As prudence suggests, \"to be merry and wise.\"      Nor ever, too curious the future to pry,    Presume on our own feeble strength to rely;    But, taught by the _past;_ for the _future_, depend    Where the wise and the good all their wishes extend.    JACOBUS.             *       *       *       *       *    FALLING STONES.    _(For the Mirror.)_      Of these bodies, the most general opinion now is, that they are really  of _celestial_ origin. But a few years ago, nothing could have appeared  more absurd than the idea that we should ever be able to examine the  most minute fragment of the siderial system; and it must, no doubt, be  reckoned among the wonders of the age in which we live, that  considerable portions of these heavenly bodies are now known to have  descended to the earth. An event so wonderful and unexpected was at  first received with incredulity and ridicule; but we may now venture to  consider the fact as well established as any other hypothesis of natural  philosophy, which does not actually admit of mathematical demonstration.  The attention of our philosophers was first called to this subject by  the falling of one of these masses of matter near Flamborough Head, in  Yorkshire; it weighed about 50 pounds, and for some years after its  descent did not excite the interest it deserved, nor would perhaps that  attention have been paid to it which was required for the investigation  of the truth, if a similar and more striking phenomenon had not happened  a few years afterwards at Benares, in the East Indies. Some fragments of  the stones which fell in India were brought to Sir Joseph Banks by Major  Williams; and Sir Joseph being desirous of knowing if there might not be  some truth in these repeated accounts of falling stones, gave them to be  analyzed, when it was found by a very skilful analysis, published in the  Transactions, 1802, that the stones collected in various countries, and  to which a similar history is attached, contained very peculiar  ingredients, and all of the same kind. The earthy parts were silex and  magnesia, in which were interspersed small grains of metallic iron.  Since these investigations, the subject has attracted very general  attention, and most of the fragments of stones said to have fallen from  heaven, and which have been preserved in the cabinets of the curious, on  account of this tradition, have been analyzed, and found to consist of  the same ingredients, varying only in their different proportions.    Pliny relates, that a great stone fell near Egos Potamos, in the  Thracian Chersonese, in the second year of the 78th Olympiad. In the  year 1706, another large stone is, on the authority of Paul Lucas, then  at Larissa, said to have fallen in Macedonia. It weighed 72 pounds.  Cardan assures us, that a shower of at least 1,200 stones fell in Italy,  the largest of which weighed 120 pounds; and their fall was accompanied  by a great light in the air.    The caaba, or great black stone, preserved by the Mahometans in the  Temple of Mecca, had probably a celestial origin. It is said to have  been brought from heaven by the angel Gabriel. Some astronomers imagine  that these stones have been thrown from a lunar volcano. There is  nothing, perhaps, philosophically inconsistent in this theory, for  volcanic appearances have been seen in the moon; and a force such as our  volcanoes exert would be sufficient to project fragments that might  possibly arrive at the surface of the earth.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE.    In presenting to the public this history of those makers of Australasia  whose work consisted in the exploration of the surface of the continent  of Australia, I have much pleasure in drawing the reader's attention to  the portraits which illustrate the text. It is, I venture to say, the  most complete collection of portraits of the explorers that has yet been  published in one volume. Some of them of course must needs be  conventional; but many of them, such as the portrait of Oxley when a  young man, and of A.C. Gregory, have never been given publicity before;  and in many cases I have selected early portraits, whenever I had the  opportunity, in preference to the oft published portrait of the same  subject when advanced in years.    There are many who assisted me in the collection of these portraits. To  Mr. F. Bladen, of the Public Library, Sydney; Mr. Malcolm Fraser, of  Perth, Western Australia; Mr. Thomas Gill, of Adelaide; Sir John Forrest;  The Reverend J. Milne Curran; Mr. Archibald Meston; and many others my  best thanks are due. In fact, in such a work as this, one cannot hope for  success unless he seek the assistance of those who remembered the  explorers in life, or have heard their friends and relatives talk  familiarly of them. Let me particularly hope that from these pages our  youth, who should be interested in the exploration of their native land,  will form an adequate idea of the character of the men who helped to make  Australia, and of some of the adverse conditions against which they  struggled so nobly.

In introducing this book, I should like to commend it to its readers as  giving an account of the explorers of Australia in a simple and concise  form not hitherto available.    It introduces them to us, tells the tale of their long-tried patience and  stubborn endurance, how they lived and did their work, and gives a short  but graphic outline of the work they accomplished in opening out and  preparing Australia as another home for our race on this side of the  world.    The battle that they fought and won was over great natural difficulties  and obstacles, as fortunately there were no ferocious wild beasts in  Australia, while the danger from the hostility of the aborigines (though  a barbarous people) was with care and judgment, with a few exceptions,  avoided.    Their triumph has resulted in peaceful progress and in permanent  occupation and settlement of a vast continent.    Of all the Australian explorers the fate of Leichhardt -- \"the Franklin  of Australia,\" as the author so justly terms him -- is alone shrouded in  mystery. \"No man knoweth his sepulchre to this day.\" His party of six  white men (including Leichhardt) and two black boys, with 12 horses, 13  mules, 50 bullocks, and 270 goats, have never been heard of since they  left McPherson's station on the Cogoon on 3rd April, 1848; and although  there have been several attempts to unravel the mystery, there is  scarcely a possibility of any discovery in regard to their fate ever  being made.    There can be no doubt that the fascination concerning the work of the  early explorers of Australia will gather strength as it goes. Hitherto we  have been too close to them rightly to appreciate what was done. This  book therefore comes at an opportune time, and is a valuable record. The  author has already done a great service to Australian explorations by his  writings, and in the present instance has added to our obligation to him  by condensing the records into a smaller compass, and by that means has  brought it within convenient limits for use in schools and for general  readers.    Of the explorers of Australia, eleven have been honoured by being placed  on the Golden Roll (Gold Medallists) of the Royal Geographical Society of  London; Edward John Eyre being the first to receive the honour in 1843,  and Ernest Giles being the eleventh and last to receive it in 1880. In  the order of Nature one generation passeth away and another generation  cometh, and so it comes to pass that every one on the Golden Roll except  myself has gone to the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller  returns.    That the Australian people will always remember the deeds of those, who,  in their day and generation, under arduous and difficult conditions  devoted themselves to the exploration of the Continent goes without  saying, and I, who in bygone years had the honour of assisting in the  task, heartily wish that such fruit may be born of those deeds that  Australia will continue to increase and flourish more and more  abundantly, and thus fulfil her destiny as the great civilising and  dominating power in the Southern Seas.
