The Jewish Manual;    OR    Practical Information in Jewish And Modern Cookery,    With a Collection of Valuable Recipes & Hints Relating to the  Toilette.        Edited by a Lady.        LONDON: 1846.          EDITOR'S PREFACE.    Among the numerous works on Culinary Science already in circulation,  there have been none which afford the slightest insight to the Cookery  of the Hebrew kitchen.    Replete as many of these are with information on various important  points, they are completely valueless to the Jewish housekeeper, not  only on account of prohibited articles and combinations being assumed  to be necessary ingredients of nearly every dish, but from the entire  absence of all the receipts peculiar to the Jewish people.    This deficiency, which has been so frequently the cause of  inconvenience and complaint, we have endeavoured in the present little  volume to supply. And in taking upon ourselves the responsibility of  introducing it to the notice of our readers, we have been actuated  by the hope that it will prove of some practical utility to those for  whose benefit it is more particularly designed.    It has been our earnest desire to simplify as much as possible the  directions given regarding the rudiments of the art, and to render the  receipts which follow, clear, easy, and concise. Our collection will  be found to contain all the best receipts, hitherto bequeathed only  by memory or manuscript, from one generation to another of the Jewish  nation, as well as those which come under the denomination of plain  English dishes; and also such French ones as are now in general use at  all refined modern tables.    A careful attention has been paid to accuracy and economy in the  proportions named, and the receipts may be perfectly depended upon, as  we have had the chief part of them tested in our own kitchen and under  our own _surveillance_.    All difficult and expensive modes of cookery have been purposely  omitted, as more properly belonging to the province of the  confectioner, and foreign to the intention of this little work; the  object of which is, to guide the young Jewish housekeeper in the  luxury and economy of \"The Table,\" on which so much of the pleasure of  social intercourse depends.    The various acquirements, which in the present day are deemed  essential to female education, rarely leave much time or inclination  for the humble study of household affairs; and it not unfrequently  happens, that the mistress of a family understands little more  concerning the dinner table over which she presides, than the graceful  arrangement of the flowers which adorn it; thus she is incompetent to  direct her servant, upon whose inferior judgment and taste she is  obliged to depend. She is continually subjected to impositions from  her ignorance of what is required for the dishes she selects, while a  lavish extravagance, or parsimonious monotony betrays her utter  inexperience in all the minute yet indispensible details of elegant  hospitality.    However, there are happily so many highly accomplished and  intellectual women, whose example proves the compatability of uniting  the cultivation of talents with domestic pursuits, that it would be  superfluous and presumptuous were we here to urge the propriety and  importance of acquiring habits of usefulness and household knowledge,  further than to observe that it is the unfailing attribute of a  superior mind to turn its attention occasionally to the lesser objects  of life, aware how greatly they contribute to its harmony and its  happiness.    The _Cuisine_ of a woman of refinement, like her dress or her  furniture, is distinguished, not for its costliness and profusion, but  for a pervading air of graceful originality. She is quite sensible  of the regard due to the reigning fashion of the day, but her own  tasteful discrimination is always perceptible. She instinctively  avoids every thing that is hackneyed, vulgar, and common place,  and uniformly succeeds in pleasing by the judicious novelties she  introduces.    We hope, therefore, that this unpretending little work may not prove  wholly unacceptable, even to those ladies who are not of the Hebrew  persuasion, as it will serve as a sequel to the books on cookery  previously in their possession, and be the medium of presenting them  with numerous receipts for rare and exquisite compositions, which if  uncommemorated by the genius of Vatel, Ude, or Careme, are delicious  enough not only to gratify the lovers of good cheer generally, but to  merit the unqualified approbation of the most fastidious epicures.    We ought, perhaps, to apologize for the apparent incongruity of  connecting the \"Toilet\" with the \"Kitchen;\" but the receipts and  suggestions comprised in the Second Part of the work before us,  will not, we trust, be considered misplaced in a volume addressed  exclusively to the ladies.    Many of the receipts are for articles in common use, but which, with  proper directions, are prepared with greater economy and in a superior  manner at home; the others are all original receipts, many of them  extremely ancient, and given to us by a person who can vouch for their  efficacy from personal experience and observation.    We must now conclude our preliminary remarks, but cannot take leave of  our patient readers without availing ourselves of the opportunity our  editorial capacity affords, to express our hope, that with all its  faults and deficiencies \"The Jewish Manual\" may prove to them a useful  assistant, and be fortunate enough to meet with their lenient, kind,  and favourable consideration.

CRILE, M.D.    PROFESSOR OF SURGERY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY  VISITING SURGEON TO THE LAKESIDE HOSPITAL, CLEVELAND    EDITED BY  AMY F. ROWLAND, B. S.          PREFACE      IN response to numerous requests I have brought together into this volume  eight papers which may serve as a supplement to the volumes previously  published[*] and as a preface to monographs now in preparation.      [*] Surgical Shock, 1899; Surgery of the Respiratory System, 1899;  Problems Relating to Surgical Operations, 1901; Blood Pressure  in Surgery, 1903; Hemorrhage and Transfusion, 1909;  Anemia and Resuscitation, 1914; and Anoci-association, 1914  (with Dr. W. E. Lower).      In the first of these addresses, the Ether Day Address, delivered at  the Massachusetts General Hospital in October, 1910, I first  enunciated the Kinetic Theory of Shock, the key to which was found  in laboratory researches and in a study of Darwin's \"Expression  of the Emotions in Man and in Animals,\" whereby the phylogenetic  origin of the emotions was made manifest and the pathologic  identity of surgical and emotional shock was established.  Since 1910 my associates and I have continued our researches through--  (a) Histologic studies of all the organs and tissues of the body;  (b) Estimation of the H-ion concentration of the blood in the emotions  of anger and fear and after the application of many other forms of stimuli;  (c) Functional tests of the adrenals, and (d) Clinical observations.    It would seem that if the striking changes produced by fear  and anger and by physical trauma in the master organ of the body--  the brain--were due to WORK, then we should expect to find  corresponding histologic changes in other organs of the body as well.  We therefore examined every organ and tissue of the bodies of animals  which had been subjected to intense fear and anger and to infection and  to the action of foreign proteins, some animals being killed immediately;  some several hours after the immediate effects of the stimuli had passed;  some after seances of strong emotion had been repeated several  times during a week or longer.    The examination of all the tissues and organs of these animals  showed changes in three organs only, and with few exceptions in all  three of these organs--the brain, the adrenals, and the liver.  The extent of these changes is well shown by the photomicrographs  which illustrate the paper on \"The Kinetic System\" which is included  in this volume.  This paper describes many experiments which show  that the brain, the adrenal, and the liver play together constantly  and that no one of these organs--as far at least as is indicated  by the histologic studies--can act without the co-operation  of the other two.    Another striking fact which has been experimentally established  is that the deterioration of these three organs caused by emotion,  by exertion, and by other causes is largely counteracted,  if not exclusively, during sleep.  If animals exhausted by the continued  application of a stimulus are allowed complete rest for a certain  number of hours, _*without sleep_, the characteristic histologic  appearance of exhaustion in the brain, adrenals, and liver is not  altered notably, whereas in animals allowed to sleep for the same  number of hours the histologic changes in these organs are lessened--  in some cases obliterated even.    This significant phenomenon and its relation will be dealt with in  a later monograph.    Many of the arguments and illustrations by which the primary  premises were established are repeated--a few in all--many in  more than one of these addresses.  It will be observed, however,  that the APPLICATION of these premises varies, and that their  SIGNIFICANCE broadens progressively.    In the Ether Day Address the phylogenetic key supplied by Darwin was  utilized to formulate the principle that the organism reacts as a unit  to the stimuli of physical injury, of emotion, of infection, etc.  To the study of these reactions (transformations of energy)  the epoch-making work of Sherrington, \"The Integrative Action  of the Nervous System,\" gave an added key by which the dominating  role of the brain was determined.  Later the original work  of Cannon on the adrenal glands gave facts, and an experimental  method by which Darwin's phylogenetic theory of the emotions  was further elaborated in other papers, especially in the one  entitled \"Phylogenetic Association in Relation to the Emotions,\"  read before The American Philosophical Society in April, 1911.

The discovery of the anesthetic properties of ether and its practical  application to surgery must always stand as one of the great  achievements of medicine.  It is eminently fitting that the anniversary  of that notable day, when the possibilities of ether were first  made known to the world, should be celebrated within these walls,  and whatever the topic of your Ether Day orator, he must fittingly  pause first to pay tribute to that great event and to the master  surgeons of the Massachusetts General Hospital.  On this occasion,  on behalf of the dumb animals as well as on behalf of suffering humanity,  I express a deep sense of gratitude for the blessings of anesthesia.    Two years ago, an historic appreciation of the discovery of ether  was presented here by Professor Welch, and last year an address  on medical research was given by President Eliot.  I, therefore,  will not attempt a general address, but will invite your  attention to an experimental and clinical study.  In presenting  the summaries of the large amount of data in these researches,  I acknowledge with gratitude the great assistance rendered by  my associates, Dr. D. H. Dolley, Dr. H. G. Sloan, Dr. J. B. Austin,  and Dr. M. L. Menten.[*]      [*] From the H. K. Cushing Laboratory of Experimental Medicine,  Western Reserve University, Cleveland.      The scope of this paper may be explained by a concrete example.  When a barefoot boy steps on a sharp stone there is an immediate discharge  of nervous energy in his effort to escape from the wounding stone.  This is not a voluntary act.  It is not due to his own personal experience--  his ontogeny--but is due to the experience of his progenitors  during the vast periods of time required for the evolution  of the species to which he belongs, _i.  e_., his phylogeny.  The wounding stone made an impression upon the nerve receptors  in the foot similar to the innumerable injuries which gave origin  to this nerve mechanism itself during the boy's vast phylogenetic or  ancestral experience.  The stone supplied the phylogenetic association,  and the appropriate discharge of nervous energy automatically followed.  If the sole of the foot be repeatedly bruised or crushed by a stone,  shock may be produced; if the stone be only lightly applied,  then the consequent sensation of tickling causes a discharge of  nervous energy.  In like manner there have been implanted in the body  other mechanisms of ancestral or phylogenetic origin whose purpose  is the discharge of nervous energy for the good of the individual.  In this paper I shall discuss the origin and mode of action of some  of these mechanisms and their relation to certain phases of anesthesia.    The word anesthesia--meaning WITHOUT FEELING--describes accurately  the effect of ether in anesthetic dosage.  Although no pain  is felt in operations under inhalation anesthesia, the _*nerve  impulses excited by a surgical operation still reach the brain_.  We know that not every portion of the brain is fully anesthetized,  since surgical anesthesia does not kill.  The question then is:  What effect has trauma under surgical anesthesia upon the part  of the brain THAT REMAINS AWAKE?  If, in surgical anesthesia,  the traumatic impulses cause an excitation of the wide-awake cells,  are the remainder of the cells of the brain, despite anesthesia,  affected in any way?  If so, they are prevented by the anesthesia from  expressing that influence in conscious perception or in muscular action.  Whether the ANESTHETIZED cells are influenced or not must be determined  by noting the physiologic functions of the body after anesthesia has  worn off, and in animals by an examination of the brain-cells as well.  It has long been known that the vasomotor, the cardiac, and the respiratory  centers discharge energy in response to traumatic stimuli applied  to various sensitive regions of the body during surgical anesthesia.  If the trauma be sufficient, exhaustion of the entire brain  will be observed after the effect of the anesthesia has worn off;  that is to say, despite the complete paralysis of voluntary  motion and the loss of consciousness due to ether, the traumatic  impulses that are known to reach the AWAKE centers in the medulla  also reach and influence every other part of the brain."]]]
