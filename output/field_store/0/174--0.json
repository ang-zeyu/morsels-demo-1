I must not play      On the Sabbath-day:      But I must hear      God's Word in Fear.      I must not SWEAR.      I must not Lye, I must not Feign,      I must not take God's Name in vain.      I must not Rail.      I must not Steal.      It is a Sin      To steal a Pin,      Much more to steal a greater thing.      It's better for me to be poor,      And beg my Bread from door to door,      Than to steal my Neighbour's Store.      I must Work, and I must Pray,      And God will feed me day by day,      Mine honest Labours God will Bless,      But he hateth Idleness.      My King, and all my Governors,      My Parents and Superiors,      These I must Honour and Obey,      To these I must my Duty pay.      I must not be Rude nor Wild,      I must not be a Wanton Child:      I must sing no wanton Songs,      I must forgive my Neighbours wrongs:      I must speak of no Man ill,      But to all must bear good will:      I had better die      Than tell a Lie.      I must not sin,      A World to win.      My Tongue      Must do no wrong.      If my Tongue do here Rebel,      Then my Tongue must burn in Hell.      I must Read,      I must heed,      And on the Scriptures I must feed.      I must      Put my Trust      In Christ above,      The God of Love.      Christ alone my Soul can save,      And raise my Body from the Grave.      Christ alone must have my Heart,      Christ and I must never part.      Lord, Grant that I      In Faith may dye,      And live with Christ Eternally!                _AMEN._           *       *       *       *       *        _SAYINGS,_    _For little Children to Learn._   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13291"],[0,"The World's Great Men of Music: Story-Lives of Master Musicians (#1)"],[1,"WORLD'S GREAT MEN OF MUSIC    BY    HARRIETTE BROWER    _Author of \"Piano Mastery, First and Second Series,\"  \"Home-Help in Music Study,\" \"Self-Help in  Piano Study,\" \"Vocal Mastery,\" etc_.

STOKES COMPANY    Printed in the United States of America          FOREWORD      The preparation of this volume began with a period of delightful  research work in a great musical library. As a honey-bee flutters  from flower to flower, culling sweetness from many blossoms, so  the compiler of such stories as these must gather facts from many  sources--from biography, letters, journals and musical history. Then,  impressed with the personality and individual achievement of each  composer, the author has endeavored to present his life story.    While the aim has been to make the story-sketches interesting to  young people, the author hopes that they may prove valuable to musical  readers of all ages. Students of piano, violin or other instruments  need to know how the great composers lived their lives. In every  musical career described in this book, from the old masters  represented by Bach and Beethoven to the musical prophets of our own  day, there is a wealth of inspiration and practical guidance for the  artist in any field. Through their struggles, sorrows and triumphs,  divine melody and harmony came into being, which will bless the world  for all time to come.

And even then we may  not be able to discover all the events of his life as some of the  records have been lost. But we have the main facts, and know that  Palestrina's name will be revered for all time as the man who strove  to make sacred music the expression of lofty and spiritual meaning.    Upon a hoary spur of the Apennines stands the crumbling town of  Palestrina. It is very old now; it was old when Rome was young. Four  hundred years ago Palestrina was dominated by the great castle of its  lords, the proud Colonnas. Naturally the town was much more important  in those days than it is to-day.    At that time there lived in Palestrina a peasant pair, Sante Pierluigi  and his wife Maria, who seem to have been an honest couple, and not  grindingly poor, since the will of Sante's mother has lately been  found, in which she bequeathed a house in Palestrina to her two sons.  Besides this she left behind a fine store of bed linen, mattresses and  cooking utensils. Maria Gismondi also had a little property.    To this pair was born, probably in 1526, a boy whom they named  Giovanni Pierluigi, which means John Peter Louis. This boy, from a  tiniest child, loved beauty of sight and sound. And this is not at  all surprising, for a child surrounded from infancy by the natural  loveliness and glory of old Palestrina, would unconsciously breathe in  a sense of beauty and grandeur.    It was soon discovered the boy had a voice, and his mother is said  to have sold some land she owned to provide for her son's musical  training.    From the rocky heights on which their town was built, the people  of Palestrina could look across the Campagna--the great plain  between--and see the walls and towers of Rome. At the time of our  story, Saint Peter's had withstood the sack of the city, which  happened a dozen years before, and Bramante's vast basilica had  already begun to rise. The artistic life of Rome was still at high  tide, for Raphael had passed away but twenty years before, and Michael  Angelo was at work on his Last Judgment.    Though painting and sculpture flourished, music did not keep pace with  advance in other arts. The leading musicians were Belgian, Spanish or  French, and their music did not match the great achievements attained  in the kindred art of the time--architecture, sculpture and painting.  There was needed a new impetus, a vital force. Its rise began when  the peasant youth John Peter Louis descended from the heights of  Palestrina to the banks of the Tiber.    It is said that Tomasso Crinello was the boy's master; whether this  is true or not, he was surely trained in the Netherland manner of  composition.    The youth, whom we shall now call Palestrina, as he is known by the  name of his birthplace, returned from Rome at the age of eighteen to  his native town, in 1544, as a practising musician, and took a post at  the Cathedral of Saint Agapitus. Here he engaged himself for life, to  be present every day at mass and vespers, and to teach singing to  the canons and choristers. Thus he spent the early years of his young  manhood directing the daily services and drumming the rudiments of  music into the heads of the little choristers. It may have been dry  and wearisome labor; but afterward, when Palestrina began to reform  the music of the church, it must have been of great advantage to him  to know so absolutely the liturgy, not only of Saint Peter's and Saint  John Lateran, but also that in the simple cathedral of his own small  hill-town.    Young Palestrina, living his simple, busy life in his home town, never  dreamed he was destined to become a great musician. He married in  1548, when he was about twenty-two. If he had wished to secure one of  the great musical appointments in Rome, it was a very unwise thing for  him to marry, for single singers were preferred in nine cases out of  ten. Palestrina did not seem to realize this danger to a brilliant  career, and took his bride, Lucrezia, for pure love. She seems to have  been a person after his own heart, besides having a comfortable dowry  of her own. They had a happy union, which lasted for more than thirty  years.    Although he had agreed to remain for life at the cathedral church of  Saint Agapitus, it seems that such contracts could be broken without  peril. Thus, after seven years of service, he once more turned his  steps toward the Eternal City.    He returned to Rome as a recognized musician. In 1551 he became master  of the Capella Giulia, at the modest salary of six scudi a month,  something like ten dollars. But the young chapel master seemed  satisfied. Hardly three years after his arrival had elapsed, when  he had written and printed a book containing five masses, which he  dedicated to Pope Julius III. This act pleased the pontiff, who, in  January, 1555, appointed Palestrina one of the singers of the Sistine  Chapel, with an increased salary.    It seems however, that the Sistine singers resented the appointment  of a new member, and complained about it. Several changes in the Papal  chair occurred at this time, and when Paul IV, as Pope, came into  power, he began at once with reforms. Finding that Palestrina and two  other singers were married men, he put all three out, though granting  an annuity of six scudi a month for each.    The loss of this post was a great humiliation, which Palestrina found  it hard to endure. He fell ill at this time, and the outlook was dark  indeed, with a wife and three little children to provide for.    But the clouds soon lifted. Within a few weeks after this unfortunate  event, the rejected singer of the Sistine Chapel was created Chapel  Master of Saint John Lateran, the splendid basilica, where the young  Orlandus Lassus had so recently directed the music. As Palestrina  could still keep his six scudi pension, increased with the added  salary of the new position, he was able to establish his family in a  pretty villa on the Coelian Hill, where he could be near his work at  the Lateran, but far enough removed from the turmoil of the city to  obtain the quiet he desired, and where he lived in tranquillity for  the next five years.    Palestrina spent forty-four years of his life in Rome. All the eleven  popes who reigned during this long period honored Palestrina as a  great musician. Marcellus II spent a part of his three weeks' reign  in showing kindness to the young Chapel master, which the composer  returned by naming for this pontiff a famous work, \"Mass of Pope  Marcellus.\" Pius IV, who was in power when the mass was performed,  praised it eloquently, saying John Peter Louis of Palestrina was a new  John, bringing down to the church militant the harmonies of that  \"new song\" which John the Apostle heard in the Holy City. The  musician-pope, Gregory XIII, to whom Palestrina dedicated his grandest  motets, entrusted him with the sacred task of revising the ancient  chant. Pope Sixtus V greatly praised his beautiful mass, \"Assumpta est  Maria\" and promoted him to higher honors.    With this encouragement and patronage, Palestrina labored five years  at the Lateran, ten years at Santa Maria Maggiore and twenty three at  Saint Peter's. At the last named it was his second term, of course,  but it continued from 1571 to"]]]
