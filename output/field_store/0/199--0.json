These lessons met with a hearty and  generous response from the public, and the present volume is issued in  response to the demand for the lessons in a permanent and durable form.  There have been no changes made in the text.    The publishers take the liberty to call the attention of the reader to  the great amount of information condensed within the space given to each  lesson. Students have told us that they have found it necessary to read  and study each lesson carefully, in order to absorb the varied  information contained within its pages. They have also stated that they  have found it advisable to re-read the lessons several times, allowing an  interval between each reading and that at each re-reading they would  discover information that had escaped them during the course of the  previous study. This has been repeated to us so often that we feel  justified in mentioning it, that other readers might avail themselves of  the same course and plan of study.    Following his usual custom, the writer of the lessons has declined to  write a preface for this book, claiming that the lessons speak for  themselves, and that those for whom they are intended will receive the  message contained within them, without any prefatory talk.

THE \"I.\"      In India, the Candidates for Initiation into the science of \"Raja Yoga,\"  when they apply to the Yogi Masters for instruction, are given a series  of lessons designed to enlighten them regarding the nature of the Real  Self, and to instruct them in the secret knowledge whereby they may  develop the consciousness and realization of the real \"I\" within them.  They are shown how they may cast aside the erroneous or imperfect  knowledge regarding their real identity.    Until the Candidate masters this instruction, or at least until the truth  becomes fixed in his consciousness, further instruction is denied him,  for it is held that until he has awakened to a conscious realization of  his Actual Identity, he is not able to understand the source of his  power, and, moreover, is not able to _feel_ within him the power of the  Will, which power underlies the entire teachings of \"Raja Yoga.\"    The Yogi Masters are hot satisfied if the Candidate forms merely a clear  intellectual conception of this Actual Identity, but they insist that he  must _feel_ the truth of the same--must become _aware_ of the Real  Self--must enter into a consciousness in which the realization becomes a  part of his everyday self--in which the realizing consciousness becomes  the prevailing idea in his mind, around which his entire thoughts and  actions revolve.    To some Candidates, this realization comes like a lightning flash the  moment the attention is directed toward it, while in other cases the  Candidates find it necessary to follow a rigorous course of training  before they acquire the realization in consciousness.    The Yogi Masters teach that there are two degrees of this awakening  consciousness of the Real Self. The first, which they call \"the  Consciousness of the 'I',\" is the full consciousness of _real_ existence  that comes to the Candidate, and which causes him to _know_ that he is a  real entity having a life not depending upon the body--life that will go  on in spite of the destruction of the body--_real_ life, in fact. The  second degree, which they call \"the Consciousness of the 'I AM',\" is  the consciousness of one's identity with the Universal Life, and his  relationship to, and \"in-touchness\" with all life, expressed and  unexpressed. These two degrees of consciousness come in time to all who  seek \"The Path.\" To some it comes suddenly; to others it dawns gradually;  to many it comes assisted by the exercises and practical work of \"Raja  Yoga.\"    The first lesson of the Yogi Masters to the Candidates, leading up to the  first degree, above mentioned, is as follows: That the Supreme  Intelligence of the Universe--the Absolute--has manifested the being that  we call Man--the highest manifestation on this planet. The Absolute has  manifested an infinitude of forms of life in the Universe, including  distant worlds, suns, planets, etc., many of these forms being unknown to  us on this planet, and being impossible of conception by the mind of the  ordinary man. But these lessons have nothing to do with that part of the  philosophy which deals with these myriad forms of life, for our time will  be taken up with the unfoldment in the mind of man of his true nature and  power. Before man attempts to solve the secrets of the Universe without,  he should master the Universe within--the Kingdom of the Self. When he  has accomplished this, then he may, and should, go forth to gain the  outer knowledge as a Master demanding its secrets, rather than as a slave  begging for the crumbs from the table of knowledge. The first knowledge  for the Candidate is the knowledge of the Self.    Man, the highest manifestation of the Absolute, as far as this planet is  concerned, is a wonderfully organized being--although the average man  understands but little of his real nature. He comprises within his  physical, mental and spiritual make-up both the highest and the lowest,  as we have shown in our previous lessons (the \"Fourteen Lessons\" and the  \"Advanced Course\"). In his bones he manifests almost in the form of  mineral life, in fact, in his bones, body and blood mineral substances  actually exist. The physical life of the body resembles the life of the  plant. Many of the physical desires and emotions are akin to those of the  lower animals, and in the undeveloped man these desires and emotions  predominate and overpower the higher nature, which latter is scarcely in  evidence. Then Man has a set of mental characteristics that are his own,  and which are not possessed by the lower animals (See \"Fourteen  Lessons\"). And in addition to the mental faculties common to all men, or  rather, that are in evidence in a greater or lesser degree among all men,  there are still higher faculties latent within Man, which when manifested  and expressed render Man more than ordinary Man. The unfoldment of these  latent faculties is possible to all who have reached the proper stage of  development, and the desire and hunger of the student for this  instruction is caused by the pressure of these unfolding latent  faculties, crying to be born into consciousness. Then there is that  wonderful thing, the Will, which is but faintly understood by those  ignorant of the Yogi Philosophy--the Power of the Ego--its birthright  from the Absolute.    But while these mental and physical things _belong_ to Man, they are  _not_ the Man himself. Before the Man is able to master, control, and  direct the things belonging to him--his tools and instruments--he must  awaken to a realization of Himself. He must be able to distinguish  between the \"I\" and the \"Not I.\" And this is the first task before the  Candidate.    That which is the Real Self of Man is the Divine Spark sent forth from  the Sacred Flame. It is the Child of the Divine Parent. It is  Immortal--Eternal--Indestructible--Invincible. It possesses within  itself Power, Wisdom, and Reality. But like the infant that contains  within itself the sometime Man, the mind of Man is unaware of its latent  and potential qualities, and does not know itself. As it awakens and  unfolds into the knowledge of its real nature, it manifests its  qualities, and realizes what the Absolute has given it. When the Real  Self begins to awaken, it sets aside from itself those things which  are but appendages to it, but which it, in its half-waking state, had  regarded as its Self. Setting aside first this, and then that, it finally  discards all of the \"Not I,\" leaving the Real Self free and delivered  from its bondage to its appendages. Then it returns to the discarded  appendages, and makes use of them.    In considering the question: \"What is the Real Self?\" let us first stop  to examine what man usually means when he says \"I.\"    The lower animals do not possess this \"I\" sense. They are conscious of  the outer world; of their own desires and animal cravings and feelings.  But their consciousness has not reached the Self-conscious stage. They  are not able to think of themselves as separate entities, and to reflect  upon their thoughts. They are not possessed of a consciousness of the  Divine Spark--the Ego--the Real Self. The Divine Spark is hidden in the  lower forms of life--even in the lower forms of human life--by many  sheaths that shut out its light. But, nevertheless, it is there, always.  It sleeps within the mind of the savage--then, as he unfolds, it begins"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#1)"],[1,"CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH      by Charles Reade          Etext Notes:    1.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE    A small portion of this tale appeared in Once a Week, July-September,  1859, under the title of \"A Good Fight.\"    After writing it, I took wider views of the subject, and also felt  uneasy at having deviated unnecessarily from the historical outline of  a true story. These two sentiments have cost me more than a year's very  hard labour, which I venture to think has not been wasted. After this  plain statement I trust all who comment on this work will see that to  describe it as a reprint would be unfair to the public and to me. The  English language is copious, and, in any true man's hands, quite able  to convey the truth--namely, that one-fifth of the present work is a  reprint, and four-fifths of it a new composition.    CHARLES READE          CHAPTER I    Not a day passes over the earth, but men and women of no note do great  deeds, speak great words, and suffer noble sorrows. Of these obscure  heroes, philosophers, and martyrs, the greater part will never be known  till that hour, when many that are great shall be small, and the small  great; but of others the world's knowledge may be said to sleep: their  lives and characters lie hidden from nations in the annals that record  them. The general reader cannot feel them, they are presented so curtly  and coldly: they are not like breathing stories appealing to his heart,  but little historic hail-stones striking him but to glance off his  bosom: nor can he understand them; for epitomes are not narratives, as  skeletons are not human figures.    Thus records of prime truths remain a dead letter to plain folk: the  writers have left so much to the imagination, and imagination is so  rare a gift. Here, then, the writer of fiction may be of use to the  public--as an interpreter.    There is a musty chronicle, written in intolerable Latin, and in it  a chapter where every sentence holds a fact. Here is told, with harsh  brevity, the strange history of a pair, who lived untrumpeted, and died  unsung, four hundred years ago; and lie now, as unpitied, in that stern  page, as fossils in a rock. Thus, living or dead, Fate is still unjust  to them. For if I can but show you what lies below that dry chronicler's  words, methinks you will correct the indifference of centuries, and give  those two sore-tried souls a place in your heart--for a day.    It was past the middle of the fifteenth century; Louis XI was sovereign  of France; Edward IV was wrongful king of England; and Philip \"the  Good,\" having by force and cunning dispossessed his cousin Jacqueline,  and broken her heart, reigned undisturbed this many years in Holland,  where our tale begins.    Elias, and Catherine his wife, lived in the little town of Tergou. He  traded, wholesale and retail, in cloth, silk, brown holland, and,  above all, in curried leather, a material highly valued by the middling  people, because it would stand twenty years' wear, and turn an ordinary  knife, no small virtue in a jerkin of that century, in which folk were  so liberal of their steel; even at dinner a man would leave his meat  awhile, and carve you his neighbour, on a very moderate difference of  opinion.    The couple were well to do, and would have been free from all earthly  care, but for nine children. When these were coming into the world, one  per annum, each was hailed with rejoicings, and the saints were thanked,  not expostulated with; and when parents and children were all young  together, the latter were looked upon as lovely little playthings  invented by Heaven for the amusement, joy, and evening solace of people  in business.    But as the olive-branches shot up, and the parents grew older, and saw  with their own eyes the fate of large families, misgivings and care  mingled with their love. They belonged to a singularly wise and  provident people: in Holland reckless parents were as rare as  disobedient children. So now when the huge loaf came in on a gigantic  trencher, looking like a fortress in its moat, and, the tour of the  table once made, seemed to have melted away, Elias and Catherine would  look at one another and say, \"Who is to find bread for them all when we  are gone?\"    At this observation the younger ones needed all their filial respect to  keep their little Dutch countenances; for in their opinion dinner and  supper came by nature like sunrise and sunset, and, so long as that  luminary should travel round the earth, so long as the brown loaf go  round their family circle, and set in their stomachs only to rise again  in the family oven. But the remark awakened the national thoughtfulness  of the elder boys, and being often repeated, set several of the family  thinking, some of them good thoughts, some ill thoughts, according to  the nature of the thinkers.    \"Kate, the children grow so, this table will soon be too small.\"    \"We cannot afford it, Eli,\" replied Catherine, answering not his words,  but his thought, after the manner of women.    Their anxiety for the future took at times a less dismal but more  mortifying turn. The free burghers had their pride as well as the  nobles; and these two could not bear that any of their blood should go  down in the burgh after their decease.    So by prudence and self-denial they managed to clothe all the little  bodies, and feed all the great mouths, and yet put by a small hoard  to meet the future; and, as it grew and grew, they felt a pleasure the  miser hoarding for himself knows not.    One day the eldest boy but one, aged nineteen, came to his mother, and,  with that outward composure which has so misled some persons as to the  real nature of this people, begged her to intercede with his father to  send him to Amsterdam, and place him with a merchant. \"It is the way  of life that likes me: merchants are wealthy; I am good at numbers;  prithee, good mother, take my part in this, and I shall ever be, as I am  now, your debtor.\"    Catherine threw up her hands with dismay and incredulity.    \"What! leave Tergou!\"    \"What is one street to me more than another? If I can leave the folk of  Tergou, I can surely leave the stones.\"    \"What! quit your poor father now he is no longer young?\"    \"Mother, if I can leave you, I can leave\"    \"What! leave your poor brothers and sisters, that love you so dear?\"    \"There are enough in the house without me.\"    \"What mean you, Richart? Who is more thought of than you Stay, have I  spoken sharp to you? Have I been unkind to you?\"    \"Never that I know of; and if you had, you should never hear of it from  me. Mother,\" said Richart gravely, but the tear was in his eye, \"it all  lies in a word, and nothing can change my mind. There will be one mouth  less for you to feed.'    \"There now, see what my tongue has done,\" said Catherine, and the next  moment she began to cry. For she saw her first young bird on the edge  of the nest trying his wings to fly into the world. Richart had a calm,  strong will, and she knew he never wasted a word.    It ended as nature has willed all such discourse shall end: young  Richart went to Amsterdam with a face so long and sad as it had never  been seen before, and a heart like granite.    That afternoon at supper there was one mouth less. Catherine looked at  Richart's chair and wept bitterly. On this Elias shouted roughly and  angrily to the children, \"Sit wider, can't ye: sit wider!\" and turned  his head away over the back of his seat awhile, and was silent.    Richart was launched, and never cost them another penny; but to fit him  out and place him in the house of Vander Stegen, the merchant, took all  the little hoard but one gold crown. They began again. Two years passed,  Richart found a niche in commerce for his brother Jacob, and Jacob left  Tergou directly after dinner, which was at eleven in the forenoon. At  supper that day Elias remembered what had happened the last time; so it  was in a low whisper he said, \"Sit wider, dears!\" Now until that moment,  Catherine would not see the gap at table, for her daughter Catherine had  besought her not to grieve to-night, and she had said, \"No, sweetheart,  I promise I will not, since it vexes my children.\" But when Elias  whispered \"Sit wider!\" says she, \"Ay! the table will soon be too big  for the children, and you thought it would be too small;\" and having  delivered this with forced calmness, she put up her apron the next  moment, and wept sore.    \"'Tis the best that leave us,\" sobbed she; \"that is the cruel part.\"    \"Nay! nay!\" said Elias, \"our children are good children, and all are  dear to us alike. Heed her not! What God takes from us still seems  better that what He spares to us; that is to say, men are by nature  unthankful--and women silly.\"    \"And I say Richart and Jacob were the flower of the flock,\" sobbed  Catherine.    The little coffer was empty again, and to fill it they gathered  like ants. In those days speculation was pretty much confined to the  card-and-dice business. Elias knew no way to wealth but the slow and  "]]]
