In order to emphasise the importance of the reforms introduced into  astronomy by Kepler, it will be well to sketch briefly the history of  the theories which he had to overthrow. In very early times it must have  been realised that the sun and moon were continually changing their  places among the stars. The day, the month, and the year were obvious  divisions of time, and longer periods were suggested by the tabulation  of eclipses. We can imagine the respect accorded to the Chaldaean sages  who first discovered that eclipses could be predicted, and how the  philosophers of Mesopotamia must have sought eagerly for evidence of  fresh periodic laws. Certain of the stars, which appeared to wander, and  were hence called planets, provided an extended field for these  speculations. Among the Chaldaeans and Babylonians the knowledge  gradually acquired was probably confined to the priests and utilised  mainly for astrological prediction or the fixing of religious  observances. Such speculations as were current among them, and also  among the Egyptians and others who came to share their knowledge, were  almost entirely devoted to mythology, assigning fanciful terrestrial  origins to constellations, with occasional controversies as to how the  earth is supported in space. The Greeks, too, had an elaborate mythology  largely adapted from their neighbours, but they were not satisfied with  this, and made persistent attempts to reduce the apparent motions of  celestial objects to geometrical laws. Some of the Pythagoreans, if not  Pythagoras himself, held that the earth is a sphere, and that the  apparent daily revolution of the sun and stars is really due to a motion  of the earth, though at first this motion of the earth was not supposed  to be one of rotation about an axis. These notions, and also that the  planets on the whole move round from west to east with reference to the  stars, were made known to a larger circle through the writings of Plato.  To Plato moreover is attributed the challenge to astronomers to  represent all the motions of the heavenly bodies by uniformly described  circles, a challenge generally held responsible for a vast amount of  wasted effort, and the postponement, for many centuries, of real  progress. Eudoxus of Cnidus, endeavouring to account for the fact that  the planets, during every apparent revolution round the earth, come to  rest twice, and in the shorter interval between these \"stationary  points,\" move in the opposite direction, found that he could represent  the phenomena fairly well by a system of concentric spheres, each  rotating with its own velocity, and carrying its own particular planet  round its own equator, the outermost sphere carrying the fixed stars. It  was necessary to assume that the axes about which the various spheres  revolved should have circular motions also, and gradually an increased  number of spheres was evolved, the total number required by Aristotle  reaching fifty-five. It may be regarded as counting in Aristotle's  favour that he did consider the earth to be a sphere and not a flat  disc, but he seems to have thought that the mathematical spheres of  Eudoxus had a real solid existence, and that not only meteors, shooting  stars and aurora, but also comets and the milky way belong to the  atmosphere. His really great service to science in collating and  criticising all that was known of natural science would have been  greater if so much of the discussion had not been on the exact meaning  of words used to describe phenomena, instead of on the facts and causes  of the phenomena themselves.    Aristarchus of Samos seems to have been the first to suggest that the  planets revolved not about the earth but about the sun, but the idea  seemed so improbable that it was hardly noticed, especially as  Aristarchus himself did not expand it into a treatise.    About this time the necessity for more accurate places of the sun and  moon, and the liberality of the Ptolemys who ruled Egypt, combined to  provide regular observations at Alexandria, so that, when Hipparchus  came upon the scene, there was a considerable amount of material for him  to use. His discoveries marked a great advance in the science of  astronomy. He noted the irregular motion of the sun, and, to explain it,  assumed that it revolved uniformly not exactly about the earth but  about a point some distance away, called the \"excentric\".[1] The line  joining the centre of the earth to the excentric passes through the  apses of the sun's orbit, where its distance from the earth is greatest  and least. The same result he could obtain by assuming that the sun  moved round a small circle, whose centre described a larger circle about  the earth; this larger circle carrying the other was called the  \"deferent\": so that the actual motion of the sun was in an epicycle. Of  the two methods of expression Hipparchus ultimately preferred the  second. He applied the same process to the moon but found that he could  depend upon its being right only at new and full moon. The irregularity  at first and third quarters he left to be investigated by his  successors. He also considered the planetary observations at his  disposal insufficient and so gave up the attempt at a complete planetary  theory. He made improved determinations of some of the elements of the  motions of the sun and moon, and discovered the Precession of the  Equinoxes, from the Alexandrian observations which showed that each year  as the sun came to cross the equator at the vernal equinox it did so at  a point about fifty seconds of arc earlier on the ecliptic, thus  producing in 150 years an unmistakable change of a couple of degrees, or  four times the sun's diameter. He also invented trigonometry. His star  catalogue was due to the appearance of a new star which caused him to  search for possible previous similar phenomena, and also to prepare for  checking future ones. No advance was made in theoretical astronomy for  260 years, the interval between Hipparchus and Ptolemy of Alexandria.  Ptolemy accepted the spherical form of the earth but denied its rotation  or any other movement. He made no advance on Hipparchus in regard to the  sun, though the lapse of time had largely increased the errors of the  elements adopted by the latter. In the case of the moon, however,  Ptolemy traced the variable inequality noticed sometimes by Hipparchus  at first and last quarter, which vanished when the moon was in apogee or  perigee. This he called the evection, and introduced another epicycle  to represent it. In his planetary theory he found that the places given  by his adopted excentric did not fit, being one way at apogee and the  other at perigee; so that the centre of distance must be nearer the  earth. He found it best to assume the centre of distance half-way  between the centre of the earth and the excentric, thus \"bisecting the  excentricity\". Even this did not fit in the case of Mercury, and in  general the agreement between theory and observation was spoilt by the  necessity of making all the orbital planes pass through the centre of  the earth, instead of the sun, thus making a good accordance practically  impossible.    [Footnote 1: See Glossary for this and other technical terms.]    After Ptolemy's time very little was heard for many centuries of any  fresh planetary theory, though advances in some points of detail were  made, notably by some of the Arab philosophers, who obtained improved  values for some of the elements by using better instruments. From time  to time various modifications of Ptolemy's theory were suggested, but  none of any real value. The Moors in Spain did their share of the work  carried on by their Eastern co-religionists, and the first independent  star catalogue since the time of Hipparchus was made by another  Oriental, Tamerlane's grandson, Ulugh Begh, who built a fine observatory  at Samarcand in the fifteenth century. In Spain the work was not  monopolised by the Moors, for in the thirteenth century Alphonso of  Castile, with the assistance of Jewish and Christian computers, compiled  the Alphonsine tables, completed in 1252, in which year he ascended the  throne as Alphonso X. They were long circulated in MS. and were first  printed in 1483, not long before the end of the period of stagnation.    Copernicus was born in 1473 at Thorn in Polish Prussia. In the course of  his studies at Cracow and at several Italian universities, he learnt all  that was known of the Ptolemaic astronomy and determined to reform it.  His maternal uncle, the Bishop of Ermland, having provided him with a  lay canonry in the Cathedral of Frauenburg, he had leisure to devote  himself to Science. Reviewing the suggestions of the ancient Greeks, he  was struck by the simplification that would be introduced by reviving  the idea that the annual motion should be attributed to the earth itself  instead of having a separate annual epicycle for each planet and for the  sun. Of the seventy odd circles or epicycles required by the latest form  of the Ptolemaic system, Copernicus succeeded in dispensing with rather  more than half, but he still required thirty-four, which was the exact  number assumed before the time of Aristotle. His considerations were  almost entirely mathematical, his only invasion into physics being in  defence of the \"moving earth\" against the stock objection that if the  earth moved, loose objects would fly off, and towers fall.

The following diary was kept in the winter and spring of 1838-9, on an  estate consisting of rice and cotton plantations, in the islands at the  entrance of the Altamaha, on the coast of Georgia.    The slaves in whom I then had an unfortunate interest were sold some years  ago. The islands themselves are at present in the power of the Northern  troops.

Philadelphia: December 1838.    My Dear E----. I return you Mr. ----'s letter. I do not think it answers  any of the questions debated in our last conversation at all  satisfactorily: the _right_ one man has to enslave another, he has not the  hardihood to assert; but in the reasons he adduces to defend that act of  injustice, the contradictory statements he makes appear to me to refute  each other. He says, that to the continental European protesting against  the abstract iniquity of slavery, his answer would be, 'the slaves are  infinitely better off than half the continental peasantry.' To the  Englishman, 'they are happy compared with the miserable Irish.' But  supposing that this answered the question of original injustice, which it  does not, it is not a true reply. Though the negroes are fed, clothed, and  housed, and though the Irish peasant is starved, naked, and roofless, the  bare name of freeman--the lordship over his own person, the power to  choose and will--are blessings beyond food, raiment, or shelter;  possessing which, the want of every comfort of life is yet more tolerable  than their fullest enjoyment without them. Ask the thousands of ragged  destitutes who yearly land upon these shores to seek the means of  existence--ask the friendless, penniless foreign emigrant, if he will give  up his present misery, his future uncertainty, his doubtful and difficult  struggle for life, at once, for the secure, and as it is called, fortunate  dependance of the slave: the indignation with which he would spurn the  offer will prove that he possesses one good beyond all others, and that  his birthright as a man is more precious to him yet than the mess of  pottage for which he is told to exchange it because he is starving.    Of course the reverse alternative cannot be offered to the slaves, for  at the very word the riches of those who own them would make themselves  wings and flee away. But I do not admit the comparison between your  slaves and even the lowest class of European free labourers, for the  former are _allowed_ the exercise of no faculties but those which they  enjoy in common with the brutes that perish. The just comparison is  between the slaves and the useful animals to whose level your laws  reduce them; and I will acknowledge that the slaves of a kind owner may  be as well cared for, and as happy, as the dogs and horses of a merciful  master; but the latter condition--i.e. that of happiness--must again  depend upon the complete perfection of their moral and mental  degradation. Mr. ----, in his letter, maintains that they _are_ an  inferior race, and, compared with the whites, '_animals_, incapable of  mental culture and moral improvement:' to this I can only reply, that if  they are incapable of profiting by instruction, I do not see the  necessity for laws inflicting heavy penalties on those who offer it to  them. If they really are brutish, witless, dull, and devoid of capacity  for progress, where lies the _danger_ which is constantly insisted upon  of offering them that of which they are incapable. We have no laws  forbidding us to teach our dogs and horses as much as they can  comprehend; nobody is fined or imprisoned for reasoning upon knowledge,  and liberty, to the beasts of the field, for they are incapable of such  truths. But these themes are forbidden to slaves, not because they  cannot, but because they can and would seize on them with  avidity--receive them gladly, comprehend them quickly; and the masters'  power over them would be annihilated at once and for ever. But I have  more frequently heard, not that they were incapable of receiving  instruction, but something much nearer the truth--that knowledge only  makes them miserable: the moment they are in any degree enlightened,  they become unhappy. In the letter I return to you Mr. ---- says that  the very slightest amount of education, merely teaching them to read,  'impairs their value as slaves, for it instantly destroys their  contentedness, and since you do not contemplate changing their  condition, it is surely doing them an ill service to destroy their  acquiescence in it;' but this is a very different ground of argument  from the other. The discontent they evince upon the mere dawn of an  advance in intelligence proves not only that they can acquire but  combine ideas, a process to which it is very difficult to assign a  limit; and there indeed the whole question lies, and there and nowhere  else the shoe really pinches. A slave is ignorant; he eats, drinks,  sleeps, labours, and is happy. He learns to read; he feels, thinks,  reflects, and becomes miserable. He discovers himself to be one of a  debased and degraded race, deprived of the elementary rights which God  has granted to all men alike; every action is controlled, every word  noted; he may not stir beyond his appointed bounds, to the right hand or  to the left, at his own will, but at the will of another he may be sent  miles and miles of weary journeying--tethered, yoked, collared, and  fettered--away from whatever he may know as home, severed from all those  ties of blood and affection which he alone of all human, of all living  creatures on the face of the earth may neither enjoy in peace nor defend  when they are outraged. If he is well treated, if his master be  tolerably humane or even understand his own interest tolerably, this is  probably _all_ he may have to endure: it is only to the consciousness of  these evils that knowledge and reflection awaken him. But how is it if  his master be severe, harsh, cruel--or even only careless--leaving his  creatures to the delegated dominion of some overseer, or agent, whose  love of power, or other evil dispositions, are checked by no  considerations of personal interest? Imagination shrinks from the  possible result of such a state of things; nor must you, or Mr. ----,  tell me that the horrors thus suggested exist only in imagination. The  Southern newspapers, with their advertisements of negro sales and  personal descriptions of fugitive slaves, supply details of misery that  it would be difficult for imagination to exceed. Scorn, derision,  insult, menace--the handcuff, the lash--the tearing away of children  from parents, of husbands from wives--the weary trudging in droves along  the common highways, the labour of body, the despair of mind, the  sickness of heart--these are the realities which belong to the system,  and form the rule, rather than the exception, in the slave's experience.  And this system exists here in this country of your's, which boasts  itself the asylum of the oppressed, the home of freedom, the one place  in all the world where all men may find enfranchisement from all  thraldoms of mind, soul, or body--the land elect of liberty.    Mr. ---- lays great stress, as a proof of the natural inferiority of the  blacks, on the little comparative progress they have made in those States  where they enjoy their freedom, and the fact that, whatever quickness of  parts they may exhibit while very young, on attaining maturity they  invariably sink again into inferiority, or at least mediocrity, and  indolence. But surely there are other causes to account for this besides  natural deficiency, which must, I think, be obvious to any unprejudiced  person observing the condition of the free blacks in your Northern  communities. If, in the early portion of their life, they escape the  contempt and derision of their white associates--if the blessed  unconsciousness and ignorance of childhood keeps them for a few years  unaware of the conventional proscription under which their whole race is  placed (and it is difficult to walk your streets, and mark the tone of  insolent superiority assumed by even the gutter-urchins over their dusky  cotemporaries, and imagine this possible)--as soon as they acquire the  first rudiments of knowledge, as soon as they begin to grow up and pass  from infancy to youth, as soon as they cast the first observing glance  upon the world by which they are surrounded, and the society of which,  they are members, they must become conscious that they are marked as the  Hebrew lepers of old, and are condemned to sit, like those unfortunates,  without the gates of every human and social sympathy. From their own sable  colour, a pall falls over the whole of God's universe to them, and they  find themselves stamped with a badge of infamy of Nature's"]]]
