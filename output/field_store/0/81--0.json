[Illustration: Falls of the Genesee.]      The Genesee is one of the most picturesque rivers of North America.  Its name is indeed characteristic: the word Genesee being formed from  the Indian for _Pleasant Valley,_ which term is very descriptive of  the river and its vicinity. Its falls have not the majestic extent  of the Niagara; but their beauty compensates for the absence of such  grandeur.    The Genesee, the principal natural feature of its district, rises  on the _Grand Plateau_ or table-land of Western Pennsylvania, runs  through New York, and flows into Lake Ontario, at Port Genesee, six  miles below Rochester. At the distance of six miles from its mouth are  falls of 96 feet, and one mile higher up, other falls of 75 feet.[1]  Above these it is navigable for boats nearly 70 miles, where are other  two falls, of 60 and 90 feet, one mile apart, in Nunda, south of  Leicester. At the head of the Genesee is a tract six miles square,  embracing waters, some of which flow into the gulf of Mexico, others  into Chesapeake Bay, and others into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This  tract is probably elevated 1,600 or 1,700 feet above the tide waters  of the Atlantic Ocean.        [1] It may be as well here to quote the formation of Cataracts          and Cascades, from Maltebrun's valuable _System of Universal          Geography._ \"It is only the sloping of the land which can at first          cause water to flow; but an impulse having been once communicated          to the mass, the pressure alone of the water will keep it in          motion, even if there were no declivity at all. Many great rivers,          in fact, flow with an almost interruptible declivity. Rivers which          descend from primitive mountains into secondary lands, often form          _cascades and cataracts_. Such are the cataracts of the Nile,          of the Ganges, and some other great rivers, which, according to          Desmarest, evidently mark the limits of the ancient land.          Cataracts are also formed by lakes: of this description are the          celebrated Falls of the Niagara; but the most picturesque falls          are those of rapid rivers, bordered by trees and precipitous          rocks. Sometimes we see a body of water, which, before it arrives          at the bottom, is broken and dissipated into showers, like the          Staubbach, (see _Mirror,_ vol. xiv. p. 385.); sometimes it forms          a watery arch, projected from a rampart of rock, under which the          traveller may pass dryshod, as the \"falling spring\" of Virginia;          in one place, in a granite district, we see the Trolhetta, and the          Rhine not far from its source, urge on their foaming billows          among the pointed rocks; in another, amidst lands of a calcareous          formation, we see the Czettina and the Kerka, rolling down          from terrace to terrace, and presenting sometimes a sheet, and          sometimes a wall, of water. Some magnificent cascades have been          formed, at least in part, by the hands of man: the cascades of          Velino, near Terni, have been attributed to Pope Clement VIII.;          other cataracts, like those of Tunguska, in Siberia, have          gradually lost their elevation by the wearing away of the rocks,          and have now only a rapid descent.\"--_Maltebrun_, vol. i.    The Engraving includes the falls of the river, with the village  of Rochester, seven miles south of Lake Ontario. This place, for  population, extent, and trade, will soon rank among the American  cities: it was not settled until about the close of the last war;  its progress was slow until the year 1820, from which period it has  rapidly improved. In 1830 it contained upwards of 12,000 inhabitants:  the first census of the village was taken in December, 1815, when the  number of inhabitants was three hundred and thirty-one. The aqueduct  which takes the Erie canal across the river forms a prominent object  of interest to all travellers. It is of hewn stone, containing eleven  arches of 50 feet span: its length is 800 feet, but a considerable  part of each end is hidden from view by mills erected since its  construction.    On the brink of the island which separates the main stream of the  river from that produced by the waste water from the mill-race,  will be seen _a scaffold or platform_ from which an eccentric but  courageous adventurer, named _Sam Patch_, made a desperate leap into  the gulf beneath. Patch had obtained some celebrity in freaks of this  description, though his feats be not recorded, like the hot-brained  patriotism of Marcus Curtius in olden history. At the fall of Niagara,  Patch had before made two leaps in safety--one of 80 and the other of  130 feet, in a vast gulf, foaming and tost aloft from the commotion  produced by a fall of nearly 200 feet. In November, 1829, Patch  visited Rochester to astonish the citizens by a leap from the falls.  His first attempt was successful, and in the presence of thousands of  spectators he leaped from the scaffold to which we have directed the  attention of the reader, a distance of 100 feet, into the abyss, in  safety. He was advertised to repeat the feat in a few days, or, as he  prophetically announced it his \"last jump,\" meaning his last jump that  season. The scaffold was duly erected, 25 feet in height, and Patch,  an hour after the time was announced, made his appearance. A multitude  had collected to witness the feat; the day was unusually cold, and Sam  was intoxicated. The river was low, and the falls near him on either  side were bare. Sam threw himself off, and the waters (to quote the  bathos of a New York newspaper) \"received him in their cold embrace.  The tide bubbled as the life left the body, and then the stillness of  death, indeed, sat upon the bosom of the waters.\" His body was found  past the spring at the mouth of the river, seven miles below where  he made his fatal leap. It had passed over two falls of 125 feet  combined, yet was not much injured. A black handkerchief taken from  his neck while on the scaffold, and tied about the body, was still  there. He is stated to have had perfect command of himself while in  the air; and, says the journalist already quoted, \"had he not been  given to habits of intoxication, he might have astonished the world,  perhaps for years, with the greatest feats ever performed by man.\"    The Genesee river waters one of the finest tracts of land in the state  of New York. Its alluvial flats are extensive, and very fertile. These  are either natural prairies, or Indian clearings, (of which, however,  the present Indians have no tradition,) and lying, to an extent of  many thousand acres, between the villages of Genesee, Moscow, and  Mount Morris, which now crown the declivities of their surrounding  uplands; and, contrasting their smooth verdure with the shaggy hills  that bound the horizon, and their occasional clumps of spreading  trees, with the tall and naked relics of the forest, nothing can  be more agreeable to the eye, long accustomed to the uninterrupted  prospect of a level and wooded country.           *       *       *       *       *        SONG FROM THE ALBUM OF A POET.    _By G.R. Carter._      THE HOMEWARD VOYAGE.        Away o'er the dancing wave,      Like the wings of the white seamew;    How proudly the hearts of the youthful brave      Their dreams of bliss renew!      And as on the pathless deep,      The bark by the gale is driven,    How glorious it is with the stars to keep      A watch on the beautiful heaven.      The winds o'er the ocean bear      Rich fragrance from the flow'rs,    That bloom on the sward, and sparkle there      Like stars in their dark blue bow'rs.      The visions of those that sail      O'er the wave with its snow-white foam,    Are haunted with scenes of the beauteous vale      That encloses their peaceful home.      They have wander'd through groves of the west,      Illumed with the fire-flies' light;    But their native land kindles a charm in each breast,      Unwaken'd by regions more bright.      The haunts that were dear to the heart      As an exquisite dream of romance,    Strew thoughts, like sweet flow'rs, round its holiest part,      And their fancy-bound spirits entrance.      Then away with the fluttering sail!      And away with the bounding wave!    While the musical sounds of the ocean-gale      Are wafted around the brave!             *       *       *       *       *      Ray wittily observes that an obscure and prolix author may not  improperly be compared to a Cuttle-fish, since he may be said to hide  himself under his own ink.             *       *       *       *       *      LINES    FROM THE GERMAN OF KOeRNER.      _Written on the morning of the Battle of Daenneberg._          Doubt-beladen, dim and hoary,        O'er us breaks the mighty day,      And the sunbeam, cold and gory,        Lights us on our fearful way.

A CLIENT FOR PAUL HARLEY    Some of Paul Harley's most interesting cases were brought to his notice  in an almost accidental way. Although he closed his office in Chancery  Lane sharply at the hour of six, the hour of six by no means marked the  end of his business day. His work was practically ceaseless. But even in  times of leisure, at the club or theatre, fate would sometimes cast in  his path the first slender thread which was ultimately to lead him into  some unsuspected labyrinth, perhaps in the underworld of London, perhaps  in a city of the Far East.    His investigation of the case of the man with the shaven skull afforded  an instance of this, and even more notable was his first meeting with  Major Jack Ragstaff of the Cavalry Club, a meeting which took place  after the office had been closed, but which led to the unmasking of  perhaps the most cunning murderer in the annals of crime.    One summer's evening when the little clock upon his table was rapidly  approaching the much-desired hour, Harley lay back in his chair and  stared meditatively across his private office in the direction of a  large and very handsome Burmese cabinet, which seemed strangely out of  place amid the filing drawers, bookshelves, and other usual impedimenta  of a professional man. A peculiarly uninteresting week was drawing to  a close, and he was wondering if this betokened a decreased activity in  the higher criminal circles, or whether it was merely one of those usual  quiescent periods which characterize every form of warfare.    Paul Harley, although the fact was unknown to the general public,  occupied something of the position of an unofficial field marshal of the  forces arrayed against evildoers. Throughout the war he had undertaken  confidential work of the highest importance, especially in regard to  the Near East, with which he was intimately acquainted. A member of  the English bar, and the last court of appeal to which Home Office and  Foreign Office alike came in troubled times, the brass plate upon the  door of his unassuming premises in Chancery Lane conveyed little or  nothing to the uninitiated.    The man himself, with his tropical bronze and air of eager vitality,  must have told the most careless observer that he stood in the presence  of an extraordinary personality. He was slightly gray at the temples in  these days, but young in mind and body, physically fit, and possessed  of an intellectual keenness which had forced recognition from two  hemispheres. His office was part of an old city residence, and his  chambers adjoined his workroom, so that now, noting that his table clock  registered the hour of six, he pressed a bell which summoned Innes, his  confidential secretary.    \"Well, Innes,\" said Harley, looking around, \"another uneventful day.\"    \"Very uneventful, Mr. Harley. About a month of this and you will have to  resume practice at the bar.\"    Paul Harley laughed.    \"Not a bit likely, Innes,\" he replied. \"No more briefs for me. I shall  retire to Norfolk and devote my declining years to fishing.\"    \"I don't know that fishing would entirely satisfy me,\" said Innes.    \"It would more than satisfy me,\" returned Harley. \"But every man to his  own ambition. Well, there is no occasion to wait; you might as well get  along. But what's that you've got in your hand?\"    \"Well,\" replied Innes, laying a card upon the table, \"I was just coming  in with it when you rang.\"    Paul Harley glanced at the card.    \"Sir Charles Abingdon,\" he read aloud, staring reflectively at his  secretary. \"That is the osteologist?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Innes, \"but I fancy he has retired from practice.\"    \"Ah,\" murmured Harley, \"I wonder what he wants. I suppose I had better  see him, as I fancy that he and I met casually some years ago in India.  Ask him to come in, will you?\"    Innes retiring, there presently entered a distinguished-looking, elderly  gentleman upon whose florid face rested an expression not unlike that of  embarrassment.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he began, \"I feel somewhat ill at ease in encroaching  upon your time, for I am by no means sure that my case comes within your  particular province.\"    \"Sit down, Sir Charles,\" said Harley with quiet geniality. \"Officially,  my working day is ended; but if nothing comes of your visit beyond a  chat it will have been very welcome. Calcutta, was it not, where we last  met?\"    \"It was,\" replied Sir Charles, placing his hat and cane upon the table  and sitting down rather wearily in a big leather armchair which Harley  had pushed forward. \"If I presume upon so slight an acquaintance, I am  sorry, but I must confess that only the fact of having met you socially  encouraged me to make this visit.\"    He raised his eyes to Harley's face and gazed at him with that  peculiarly searching look which belongs to members of his profession;  but mingled with it was an expression of almost pathetic appeal, of  appeal for understanding, for sympathy of some kind.    \"Go on, Sir Charles,\" said Harley. He pushed forward a box of cigars.  \"Will you smoke?\"    \"Thanks, no,\" was the answer.    Sir Charles evidently was oppressed by some secret trouble, thus Harley  mused silently, as, taking out a tin of tobacco from a cabinet beside  him, he began in leisurely manner to load a briar. In this he desired  to convey that he treated the visit as that of a friend, and also,  since business was over, that Sir Charles might without scruple speak at  length and at leisure of whatever matters had brought him there.    \"Very well, then,\" began the surgeon; \"I am painfully conscious that  the facts which I am in a position to lay before you are very scanty and  unsatisfactory.\"    Paul Harley nodded encouragingly.    \"If this were not so,\" he explained, \"you would have no occasion  to apply to me, Sir Charles. It is my business to look for facts.  Naturally, I do not expect my clients to supply them.\"    Sir Charles slowly nodded his head, and seemed in some measure to  recover confidence.    \"Briefly, then,\" he said, \"I believe my life is in danger.\"    \"You mean that there is someone who desires your death?\"    \"I do.\"    \"H'm,\" said Harley, replacing the tin in the cupboard and striking  a match. \"Even if the facts are scanty, no doubt you have fairly  substantial grounds for such a suspicion?\"    \"I cannot say that they are substantial, Mr. Harley. They are rather  more circumstantial. Frankly, I have forced myself to come here, and now  that I have intruded upon your privacy, I realize my difficulties more  keenly than ever.\"    The expression of embarrassment upon the speaker's face had grown  intense; and now he paused, bending forward in his chair. He seemed in  his glance to appeal for patience on the part of his hearer, and Harley,  lighting his pipe, nodded in understanding fashion. He was the last man  in the world to jump to conclusions. He had learned by bitter experience  that lightly to dismiss such cases as this of Sir Charles as coming  within the province of delusion, was sometimes tantamount to refusing  aid to a man in deadly peril.    \"You are naturally anxious for the particulars,\" Sir Charles presently  resumed. \"They bear, I regret to say, a close resemblance to the  symptoms of a well-known form of hallucination. In short, with one  exception, they may practically all be classed under the head of  surveillance.\"    \"Surveillance,\" said Paul Harley. \"You mean that you are more or less  constantly followed?\"    \"I do.\"    \"And what is your impression of this follower?\"    \"A very hazy one. To-night, as I came to your office, I have every  reason to believe that someone followed me in a taxicab.\"    \"You came in a car?\"    \"I did.\"    \"And a cab followed you the whole way?\"    \"Practically the whole way, except that as my chauffeur turned into  Chancery Lane, the cab stopped at the corner of Fleet Street.\"    \"Your idea is that your pursuer followed on foot from this point?\"    \"Such was my impression.\"    \"H'm, quite impossible. And is this sort of thing constant, Sir  Charles?\"    \"It has been for some time past.\"    \"Anything else?\"    \"One very notable thing, Mr. Harley. I was actually assaulted less than  a week ago within sight of my own house.\"    \"Indeed! Tell me of this.\" Paul Harley became aware of an awakening  curiosity. Sir Charles Abingdon was not the type of man who is lightly  intimidated.    \"I had been to visit a friend in the neighbourhood,\" Sir Charles  continued, \"whom I am at present attending professionally, although I am  actually retired. I was returning across the square, close to midnight,  when, fortunately for myself, I detected the sound of light, pattering  footsteps immediately behind me. The "]]]
