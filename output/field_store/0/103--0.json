Aside from the practice of my profession, the  topics I have treated are such as have always held my interest and  inspired a taste for books that discuss the human machine with its  manifestations and the causes of its varied activity. I have endeavored  to present the latest scientific thought and investigation bearing upon  the question of human conduct. I do not pretend to be an original  investigator, nor an authority on biology, psychology or philosophy. I  have simply been a student giving the subject such attention as I could  during a fairly busy life. No doubt some of the scientific conclusions  stated are still debatable and may finally be rejected. The scientific  mind holds opinions tentatively and is always ready to reexamine, modify  or discard as new evidence comes to light.    Naturally in a book of this sort there are many references to the human  mind and its activities. In most books, whether scientific or not, the  mind has generally been more closely associated with the brain than any  other portion of the body. As a rule I have assumed that this view of  mind and brain is correct. Often I have referred to it as a matter of  course. I am aware that the latest investigations seem to establish the  mind more as a function of the nervous system and the vital organs than  of the brain. Whether the brain is like a telephone exchange and is only  concerned with automatically receiving and sending out messages to the  different parts of the body, or whether it registers impressions and  compares them and is the seat of consciousness and thought, is not  important in this discussion. Whatever mind may be, or through whatever  part of the human system it may function, can make no difference in the  conclusions I have reached.    The physical origin of such abnormalities of the mind as are called  \"criminal\" is a comparatively new idea. The whole subject has long been  dealt with from the standpoint of metaphysics. Man has slowly banished  chance from the material world and left behavior alone outside the realm  of cause and effect. It has not been long since insanity was treated as  a moral defect. It is now universally accepted as a functional defect of  the human structure in its relation to environment.    My main effort is to show that the laws that control human behavior are  as fixed and certain as those that control the physical world. In fact,  that the manifestations of the mind and the actions of men are a part of  the physical world.    I am fully aware that this book will be regarded as a plea or an  apology for the criminal. To hold him morally blameless could be nothing  else. Still if man's actions are governed by natural law, the sooner it  is recognized and understood, the sooner will sane treatment be adopted  in dealing with crime. The sooner too will sensible and humane remedies  be found for the treatment and cure of this most perplexing and painful  manifestation of human behavior. I have tried conscientiously to  understand the manifold actions of men and if I have to some degree  succeeded, then to that extent I have explained and excused. I am  convinced that if we were all-wise and all-understanding, we could not  condemn.    I have not thought it best to encumber the book with references and  foot-notes, for the reason that statistics and opinions on this subject  are conflicting and imperfect, and the results after all must rest on a  broad scientific understanding of life and the laws that control human  action. Although the conclusions arrived at are in variance with popular  opinions and long-settled practice, I am convinced that they are old  truths and are in keeping with the best thought of the time.    I am aware that scientifically the words \"crime\" and \"criminal\" should  not be used. These words are associated with the idea of uncaused and  voluntary actions. The whole field is a part of human behavior and  should not be separated from the other manifestations of life. I have  retained the words because they have a popular significance which is  easy to follow.    CLARENCE DARROW.    Chicago, August 1, 1922.          CONTENTS      Chapter         I.

There can be no sane discussion of \"crime\" and \"criminals\" without an  investigation of the meaning of the words. A large majority of men, even  among the educated, speak of a \"criminal\" as if the word had a clearly  defined meaning and as if men were divided by a plain and distinct line  into the criminal and the virtuous. As a matter of fact, there is no  such division, and from the nature of things, there never can be such a  line.    Strictly speaking, a crime is an act forbidden by the law of the land,  and one which is considered sufficiently serious to warrant providing  penalties for its commission. It does not necessarily follow that this  act is either good or bad; the punishment follows for the violation of  the law and not necessarily for any moral transgression. No doubt most  of the things forbidden by the penal code are such as are injurious to  the organized society of the time and place, and are usually of such a  character as for a long period of time, and in most countries, have  been classed as criminal. But even then it does not always follow that  the violator of the law is not a person of higher type than the majority  who are directly and indirectly responsible for the law.    It is apparent that a thing is not necessarily bad because it is  forbidden by the law. Legislators are forever repealing and abolishing  criminal statutes, and organized society is constantly ignoring laws,  until they fall into disuse and die. The laws against witchcraft, the  long line of \"blue laws,\" the laws affecting religious beliefs and many  social customs, are well-known examples of legal and innocent acts which  legislatures and courts have once made criminal. Not only are criminal  statutes always dying by repeal or repeated violation, but every time a  legislature meets, it changes penalties for existing crimes and makes  criminal certain acts that were not forbidden before.    Judging from the kind of men sent to the State legislatures and to  Congress, the fact that certain things are forbidden does not mean that  these things are necessarily evil; but rather, that politicians believe  there is a demand for such legislation from the class of society that is  most powerful in political action. No one who examines the question can  be satisfied that a thing is intrinsically wrong because it is forbidden  by a legislative body.    Other more or less popular opinions of the way to determine right or  wrong are found to be no more satisfactory. Many believe that the  question of whether an act is right or wrong is to be settled by a  religious doctrine; but the difficulties are still greater in this  direction. First of all, this involves a thorough and judicial inquiry  into the merits of many, if not all, forms of religion, an investigation  which has never been made, and from the nature of things cannot be made.  The fact is, that one's religious opinions are settled long before he  begins to investigate and quite by other processes than reason. Then,  too, all religious precepts rest on interpretation, and even the things  that seem the plainest have ever been subject to manifold and sometimes  conflicting construction. Few if any religious commands can be, or ever  were, implicitly relied on without interpretation. The command, \"Thou  shalt not kill,\" seems plain, but does even this furnish an infallible  rule of conduct?    Of course this commandment could not be meant to forbid killing animals.  Yet there are many people who believe that it does, or at least should.  No Christian state makes it apply to men convicted of crime, or against  killing in war, and yet a considerable minority has always held that  both forms of killing violate the commandment. Neither can it be held to  apply to accidental killings, or killings in self-defense, or in defense  of property or family. Laws, too, provide all grades of punishment for  different kinds of killing, from very light penalties up to death.  Manifestly, then, the commandment must be interpreted, \"Thou shalt not  kill when it is wrong to kill,\" and therefore it furnishes no guide to  conduct. As well say: \"Thou shalt do nothing that is wrong.\" Religious  doctrines do not and clearly cannot be adopted as the criminal code of a  state.    In this uncertainty as to the basis of good and bad conduct, many appeal  to \"conscience\" as the infallible guide. What is conscience? It  manifestly is not a distinct faculty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team            The Mahabharata of    Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa    BOOK 4    VIRATA PARVA    Translated into English Prose from the Original Sanskrit Text    by    Kisari Mohan Ganguli    [1883-1896]              THE MAHABHARATA      VIRATA PARVA    SECTION I    (_Pandava-Pravesa Parva_)    OM! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male  beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word _Jaya_ be  uttered.    Janamejaya said, \"How did my great-grandfathers, afflicted with the fear  of Duryodhana, pass their days undiscovered in the city of Virata? And,  O Brahman, how did the highly blessed Draupadi, stricken with woe,  devoted to her lords, and ever adoring the Deity[1], spend her days  unrecognised?\"        [1] _Brahma Vadini_--Nilakantha explains this as      _Krishna-kirtanasila._    Vaisampayana said, \"Listen, O lord of men, how thy great grandfathers  passed the period of unrecognition in the city of Virata. Having in this  way obtained boons from the god of Justice, that best of virtuous men,  Yudhishthira, returned to the asylum and related unto the Brahmanas all  that had happened. And having related everything unto them, Yudhishthira  restored to that regenerate Brahmana who had followed him the churning  staff and the fire-sticks he had lost. And, O Bharata, the son of the  god of Justice, the royal Yudhishthira of high soul then called together  all his younger brothers and addressed them, saying, 'Exiled from our  kingdom, we have passed twelve years. The thirteenth year, hard to  spend, hath now come. Do thou therefore, O Arjuna, the son of Kunti,  select some spot where we may pass our days undiscovered by our  enemies.'    \"Arjuna replied, \"Even by virtue of Dharma's boon, we shall, O lord of  men, range about undiscovered by men. Still, for purposes of residence,  I shall mention some spots that are both delightful and secluded. Do  thou select some one of them. Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are,  many countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi,  Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva,  Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. Which of  these, O king, wouldst thou choose, and where, O foremost of monarchs,  shall we spend this year?'    \"Yudhishthira said 'O thou of mighty arms, it is even so. What that  adorable Lord of all creatures hath said must become true. Surely, after  consulting together, we must select some delightful, auspicious, and  agreeable region for our abode, where we may live free from fear. The  aged Virata, king of the Matsyas, is virtuous and powerful and  charitable, and is liked by all. And he is also attached to the  Pandavas. Even in the city of Virata, O child, we shall, O Bharata,  spend this year, entering his service. Tell me, ye sons of the Kuru  race, in what capacities ye will severally present yourselves before the  king of the Matsyas!'    \"Arjuna said, 'O god among men, what service wilt thou take in Virata's  kingdom? O righteous one, in what capacity wilt thou reside in the city  of Virata? Thou art mild, and charitable, and modest, and virtuous, and  firm in promise. What wilt thou, O king, afflicted as thou art with  calamity, do? A king is qualified to bear trouble like an ordinary  person. How wilt thou overcome this great calamity that has overtaken  thee?'    \"Yudhishthira replied, 'Ye sons of the Kuru race, ye bulls among men,  hear what I shall do on appearing before king Virata. Presenting myself  as a Brahmana, Kanka by name, skilled in dice and fond of play, I shall  become a courtier of that high-souled king. And moving upon chess-boards  beautiful pawns made of ivory, of blue and yellow and red and white hue,  by throws of black and red dice, I shall entertain the king with his  courtiers and friends. And while I shall continue to thus delight the  king, nobody will succeed in discovering me. And should the monarch ask  me, I shall say, _Formerly I was the bosom friend of Yudhishthira_. I  tell you that it is thus that I shall pass my days (in the city of  Virata). What office wilt thou, O Vrikodara, fill in the city of  Virata?'\"      SECTION II    \"Bhima said, 'I intend to present myself before the lord of Virata as a  cook bearing the name of Vallava. I am skilled in culinary art, and I  shall prepare curries for the king, and excelling all those skilful  cooks that had hitherto dressed his food I shall gratify the monarch.  And I shall carry mighty loads of wood. And witnessing that mighty feat,  the monarch will be pleased. And, O Bharata, beholding such superhuman  feats of mine, the servants of the royal household will honour me as a  king. And I shall have entire control over all kinds of viands and  drinks. And commanded to subdue powerful elephants and mighty bulls, I  will do as bidden. And if any combatants will fight with me in the  lists, then will I vanquish them, and thereby entertain the monarch. But  I shall not take the life of any of them. I shall only bring them down  in such way that they may not be killed. And on being asked as regards  my antecedent I shall say that--_Formerly I was the wrestler and cook of  Yudhishthira._ Thus shall I, O king, maintain myself.'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'And what office will be performed by that mighty  descendant of the Kurus, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, that foremost of  men possessed of long arms, invincible in fight, and before whom, while  he was staying with Krishna, the divine Agni himself desirous of  consuming the forest of Khandava had formerly appeared in the guise of a  Brahmana? What office will be performed by that best of warriors,  Arjuna, who proceeded to that forest and gratified Agni, vanquishing on  a single car and slaying huge _Nagas_ and _Rakshasas_, and who married  the sister of Vasuki himself, the king of the _Nagas_? Even as the sun  is the foremost of all heat-giving bodies, as the Brahmana is the best  of all bipeds, as the cobra is the foremost of all serpents, as Fire is  the first of all things possessed of energy, as the thunderbolt is the  foremost of all weapons, as the humped bull is the foremost of all  animals of the bovine breed, as the ocean is the foremost of all watery  expanses, as clouds charged with rain are the foremost of all clouds, as  Ananta is the first of all _Nagas_, as Airavata is the foremost of all  elephants, as the son is the foremost of all beloved objects, and  lastly, as the wife is the best of all friends, so, O Vrikodara, is the  youthful Gudakesa, the foremost of all bowmen. And O Bharata, what  office will be performed by Vibhatsu, the wielder of _Gandiva_, whose  car is drawn by white horses, and who is not inferior to Indra or  Vasudeva Himself? What office will be performed by Arjuna who, dwelling  for five years in the abode of the thousand-eyed Deity (Indra) shining  in celestial lustre, acquired by his own energy the science of  superhuman arms with all celestial weapons, and whom I regard as the  tenth _Rudra_, the thirteenth _Aditya_, the ninth _Vasu_, and the tenth  _Graha_, whose arms, symmetrical and long, have the skin hardened by  constant strokes of the bowstring and cicatrices which resemble those on  the humps of bulls,--that foremost of warriors who is as Himavat among  mountains, the ocean among expanses of water, Sakra among the celestial,  Havyavaha (fire) among the Vasus, the tiger among beasts, and Garuda  among feathery tribes!'    \"Arjuna replied, 'O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of  the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of  the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my cicatrized arms  with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and conch-bangles on my  wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king,  appear as one of the third sex, Vrihannala by name. And living as a  female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner  apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the  women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and  in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the  various excellent acts of men and thus conceal myself, O son of Kunti,  by feigning disguise. And, O Bharata should the king enquire, I will say  that, _I lived as a waiting maid of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's palace_.  And, O foremost of kings, concealing myself by this means, as fire is  concealed by ashes, I shall pass my days agreeably in the palace of  Virata.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, Arjuna, that best of men and  foremost of virtuous persons, became silent. Then the king addressed  another brother of his.\"[2]        [2] This speech of Vaisampayana is not included in some texts      within the second section. To include it, however, in the third,      is evidently a mistake.      SECTION III    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Tender, possessed of a graceful presence, and  deserving of every luxury as thou art, what office wilt thou, O heroic  Nakula, discharge while living in the dominions of that king? Tell me  all about it!'    \"Nakula said, 'Under the name of Granthika, I shall become the keeper of  the horses of king Virata. I have a thorough knowledge (of this work)  and am skilful in tending horses. Besides, the task is agreeable to me,  and I possess great skill in training and treating horses; and horses  are ever dear to me as they are to thee, O king of the Kurus. At my  hands even colts and mares become docile; these never become vicious in  bearing a rider or drawing a car.[3] And those persons in the city of  Virata that may enquire of me, I shall, O bull of the Bharata race,  say,--_Formerly I was employed by Yudhishthira in the charge of his  horses_.
