CAULTON REEKS    Fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons  Author of 'The Common Colics of the Horse'        1906      To  J. MacQueen, F.R.C.V.S.,    Professor of Surgery at the Royal Veterinary College, London, as a slight  acknowledgment of his ability as a teacher, and in return for many kindly  services, this volume is gratefully inscribed by    THE AUTHOR.      PREFACE      Stimulated by the reception accorded my 'Common Colics of the Horse,' both  in this country and in America, and assured by my publishers that a work on  diseases of the foot was needed, I have been led to give to the veterinary  profession the present volume.    While keeping the size of the book within reasonable limits, no effort  has been spared to render it as complete as possible. This has only been  achieved by adding to my own experience a great deal of the work of others.  To mention individually those who have given me permission to use their  writings would be too long a matter here. In every case, however, where the  quotation is of any length, the source of my information is given, either  in the text or in an accompanying footnote. A few there are who will,  perhaps, find themselves quoted without my having first obtained their  permission to do so. They, with the others, will, I am sure, accept my  hearty thanks.    The publishers have been generous in the matter of illustrations and  diagrams, and although to the older practitioner some of these may appear  superfluous, it is hoped they will serve to render the work an acceptable  textbook for the student.

The  passengers compose a house party, being guests of the Steamship  company for the time. The decks of the steamer are like broad  verandas and are covered with comfortable chairs, in which the  owners lounge about all day. Some of the more industrious women  knit and embroider, and I saw one good mother with a basket full of  mending, at which she was busily engaged at least three mornings.  Others play cards upon folding tables or write letters with  portfolios on their laps, and we had several artists who sketched  the sky and sea, but the majority read novels and guide books,  and gossiped. As birds of a feather flock together on the sea  as well as on land, previous acquaintances and congenial new  ones form little circles and cliques and entertain themselves  and each other, and, after a day or two, move their chairs around  so that they can be together. Americans and English do not mix  as readily as you might expect, although there is nothing like  coolness between them. It is only a natural restraint. They are  accustomed to their ways, and we to ours, and it is natural for  us to drift toward our own fellow countrymen.    In the afternoon nettings are hung around one of the broad decks  and games of cricket are played. One day it is the army against  the navy; another day the united service against a civilian team,  and then the cricketers in the second-class salon are invited  to come forward and try their skill against a team made up of  first-classers. In the evening there is dancing, a piano being  placed upon the deck for that purpose, and for two hours it is  very gay. The ladies are all in white, and several English women  insisted upon coming out on the deck in low-cut and short-sleeved  gowns. It is said to be the latest fashion, and is not half as  bad as their cigarette smoking or the ostentatious display of  jewelry that is made on the deck every morning. Several women,  and some of them with titles, sprawl around in steamer chairs,  wearing necklaces of pearls, diamonds, emeralds and other precious  stones, fit for only a banquet or a ball, with their fingers  blazing with jewels and their wrists covered with bracelets.  There seemed to be a rivalry among the aristocracy on our steamer  as to which could make the most vulgar display of gold, silver  and precious stones, and it occurs to me that these Englishwomen  had lived in India so long that they must have acquired the Hindu  barbaric love of jewelry.    My attention was called not long ago to a cartoon in a British  illustrated paper comparing the traveling outfits of American  and English girls. The American girl had a car load of trunks  and bags and bundles, a big bunch of umbrellas and parasols,  golf sticks, tennis racquets and all sorts of queer things, and  was dressed in a most conspicuous and elaborate manner. She was  represented as striding up and down a railway platform covered  with diamonds, boa, flashy hat and fancy finery, while the English  girl, in a close fitting ulster and an Alpine hat, leaned quietly  upon her umbrella near a small \"box,\" as they call a trunk, and a  modest traveling bag. But that picture isn't accurate. According  to my observation it ought to be reversed. I have never known  the most vulgar or the commonest American woman to make such a  display of herself in a public place as we witnessed daily among  the titled women upon the P. and O. steamer Mongolia, bound for  Bombay. Nor is it exceptional. Whenever you see an overdressed  woman loaded with jewelry in a public place in the East, you may  take it for granted that she belongs to the British nobility.  Germans, French, Italians and other women of continental Europe  are never guilty of similar vulgarity, and among Americans it  is absolutely unknown.    It is customary for everybody to dress for dinner, and, while the  practice has serious objections in stormy weather it is entirely  permissible and comfortable during the long, warm nights on the  Indian Ocean. The weather, however, was not nearly as warm as we  expected to find it. We were four days on the Red Sea and six  days on the Indian Ocean, and were entirely comfortable except  for two days when the wind was so strong and kicked up so much  water that the port-holes had to be closed, and it was very close  and stuffy in the cabin. While the sun was hot there was always  a cool breeze from one direction or another, and the captain  told me it was customary during the winter season.    The passengers on our steamer were mostly English, with a few  East Indians, and Americans. You cannot board a steamer in any  part of the world nowadays without finding some of your fellow  countrymen. They are becoming the greatest travelers of any nation  and are penetrating to uttermost parts of the earth. Many of  the English passengers were army officers returning to India  from furloughs or going out for service, and officers' families  who had been spending the hot months in England. We had lots of  lords and sirs and lady dowagers, generals, colonels and officers  of lesser rank, and the usual number of brides and bridegrooms,  on their wedding tours; others were officials of the government  in India, who had been home to be married. And we had several  young women who were going out to be married. Their lovers were  not able to leave their business to make the long voyage, and  were waiting for them in Bombay, Calcutta or in some of the other  cities. But perhaps the largest contingent were \"civil servants,\"  as employes of the government are called, who had been home on  leave. The climate of India is very trying to white people, and,  recognizing that fact, the government gives its officials six  months' leave with full pay or twelve months' leave with half  pay every five years. In that way an official who has served five  consecutive years in India can spend the sixth year in England  or anywhere else he likes.    We had several notable natives, including Judge Nayar, a judicial  magistrate at Madras who has gained eminence at the Indian bar  and was received with honors in England. He is a Parsee, a member  of that remarkable race which is descended from the Persian fire  worshipers. He dresses and talks and acts exactly like an ordinary  English barrister. There were three brothers in the attractive  native dress, Mohammedans, sons of Adamjee Peerbhoy, one of the  largest cotton manufacturers and wealthiest men in India, who  employs more than 15,000 operatives in his mills and furnished the  canvas for the tents and the khaki for the uniforms of the British  soldiers during the South African war. These young gentlemen had  been making a tour of Europe, combining business with pleasure,  and had inspected nearly all the great cotton mills in England and  on the continent, picking up points for their own improvement.  They are intelligent and enterprising men and their reputation  for integrity, ability and loyalty to the British government  has frequently been recognized in a conspicuous manner.    Our most notable shipmate was the Right Honorable Lord Lamington,  recently governor of one of the Australian provinces, on his way  to assume similar responsibility at Bombay, which is considered  a more responsible post.
