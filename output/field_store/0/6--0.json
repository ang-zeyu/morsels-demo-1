THE CALL OF SUN ROCK          CHAPTER I    THE MIRACLE      Kazan lay mute and motionless, his gray nose between his forepaws, his  eyes half closed. A rock could have appeared scarcely less lifeless than  he; not a muscle twitched; not a hair moved; not an eyelid quivered. Yet  every drop of the wild blood in his splendid body was racing in a  ferment of excitement that Kazan had never before experienced; every  nerve and fiber of his wonderful muscles was tense as steel wire.  Quarter-strain wolf, three-quarters \"husky,\" he had lived the four years  of his life in the wilderness. He had felt the pangs of starvation. He  knew what it meant to freeze. He had listened to the wailing winds of  the long Arctic night over the barrens. He had heard the thunder of the  torrent and the cataract, and had cowered under the mighty crash of the  storm. His throat and sides were scarred by battle, and his eyes were  red with the blister of the snows. He was called Kazan, the Wild Dog,  because he was a giant among his kind and as fearless, even, as the men  who drove him through the perils of a frozen world.    He had never known fear--until now. He had never felt in him before the  desire to _run_--not even on that terrible day in the forest when he had  fought and killed the big gray lynx. He did not know what it was that  frightened him, but he knew that he was in another world, and that many  things in it startled and alarmed him. It was his first glimpse of  civilization. He wished that his master would come back into the strange  room where he had left him. It was a room filled with hideous things.  There were great human faces on the wall, but they did not move or  speak, but stared at him in a way he had never seen people look before.  He remembered having looked on a master who lay very quiet and very cold  in the snow, and he had sat back on his haunches and wailed forth the  death song; but these people on the walls looked alive, and yet seemed  dead.    Suddenly Kazan lifted his ears a little. He heard steps, then low  voices. One of them was his master's voice. But the other--it sent a  little tremor through him! Once, so long ago that it must have been in  his puppyhood days, he seemed to have had a dream of a laugh that was  like the girl's laugh--a laugh that was all at once filled with a  wonderful happiness, the thrill of a wonderful love, and a sweetness  that made Kazan lift his head as they came in. He looked straight at  them, his red eyes gleaming. At once he knew that she must be dear to  his master, for his master's arm was about her. In the glow of the light  he saw that her hair was very bright, and that there was the color of  the crimson _bakneesh_ vine in her face and the blue of the _bakneesh_  flower in her shining eyes. Suddenly she saw him, and with a little cry  darted toward him.    \"Stop!\" shouted the man. \"He's dangerous! Kazan--\"    She was on her knees beside him, all fluffy and sweet and beautiful, her  eyes shining wonderfully, her hands about to touch him. Should he cringe  back? Should he snap? Was she one of the things on the wall, and his  enemy? Should he leap at her white throat? He saw the man running  forward, pale as death. Then her hand fell upon his head and the touch  sent a thrill through him that quivered in every nerve of his body. With  both hands she turned up his head. Her face was very close, and he heard  her say, almost sobbingly:    \"And you are Kazan--dear old Kazan, my Kazan, my hero dog--who brought  him home to me when all the others had died! My Kazan--my hero!\"    And then, miracle of miracles, her face was crushed down against him,  and he felt her sweet warm touch.    In those moments Kazan did not move. He scarcely breathed. It seemed a  long time before the girl lifted her face from him. And when she did,  there were tears in her blue eyes, and the man was standing above them,  his hands gripped tight, his jaws set.    \"I never knew him to let any one touch him--with their naked hand,\" he  said in a tense wondering voice. \"Move back quietly, Isobel. Good  heaven--look at that!\"    Kazan whined softly, his bloodshot eyes on the girl's face. He wanted to  feel her hand again; he wanted to touch her face. Would they beat him  with a club, he wondered, if he _dared_! He meant no harm now. He would  kill for her. He cringed toward her, inch by inch, his eyes never  faltering. He heard what the man said--\"Good heaven! Look at that!\"--and  he shuddered. But no blow fell to drive him back. His cold muzzle  touched her filmy dress, and she looked at him, without moving, her wet  eyes blazing like stars.    \"See!\" she whispered. \"See!\"    Half an inch more--an inch, two inches, and he gave his big gray body a  hunch toward her. Now his muzzle traveled slowly upward--over her foot,  to her lap, and at last touched the warm little hand that lay there. His  eyes were still on her face: he saw a queer throbbing in her bare white  throat, and then a trembling of her lips as she looked up at the man  with a wonderful look. He, too, knelt down beside them, and put his arm  about the girl again, and patted the dog on his head. Kazan did not like  the man's touch. He mistrusted it, as nature had taught him to mistrust  the touch of all men's hands, but he permitted it because he saw that it  in some way pleased the girl.    \"Kazan, old boy, you wouldn't hurt her, would you?\" said his master  softly. \"We both love her, don't we, boy? Can't help it, can we? And  she's ours, Kazan, all _ours_! She belongs to you and to me, and we're  going to take care of her all our lives, and if we ever have to we'll  fight for her like hell--won't we? Eh, Kazan, old boy?\"    For a long time after they left him where he was lying on the rug,  Kazan's eyes did not leave the girl. He watched and listened--and all  the time there grew more and more in him the craving to creep up to them  and touch the girl's hand, or her dress, or her foot. After a time his  master said something, and with a little laugh the girl jumped up and  ran to a big, square, shining thing that stood crosswise in a corner,  and which had a row of white teeth longer than his own body. He had  wondered what those teeth were for. The girl's fingers touched them now,  and all the whispering of winds that he had ever heard, all the music of  the waterfalls and the rapids and the trilling of birds in spring-time,  could not equal the sounds they made. It was his first music. For a  moment it startled and frightened him, and then he felt the fright pass  away and a strange tingling in his body. He wanted to sit back on his  haunches and howl, as he had howled at the billion stars in the skies on  cold winter nights. But something kept him from doing that. It was the  girl. Slowly he began slinking toward her. He felt the eyes of the man  upon him, and stopped. Then a little more--inches at a time, with his  throat and jaw straight out along the floor! He was half-way to  her--half-way across the room--when the wonderful sounds grew very soft  and very low.    \"Go on!\" he heard the man urge in a low quick voice. \"Go on! Don't  stop!\"    The girl turned her head, saw Kazan cringing there on the floor, and  continued to play. The man was still looking, but his eyes could not  keep Kazan back now. He went nearer, still nearer, until at last his  outreaching muzzle touched her dress where it lay piled on the floor.  And then--he lay trembling, for she had begun to sing. He had heard a  Cree woman crooning in front of her tepee; he had heard the wild chant  of the caribou song--but he had never heard anything like this  wonderful sweetness that fell from the lips of the girl. He forgot his  master's presence now. Quietly, cringingly, so that she would not know,  he lifted his head. He saw her looking at him; there was something in  her wonderful eyes that gave him confidence, and he laid his head in her  lap. For the second time he felt the touch of a woman's hand, and he  closed his eyes with a long sighing breath. The music stopped. There  came a little fluttering sound above him, like a laugh and a sob in one.  He heard his master cough.    \"I've always loved the old rascal--but I never thought he'd do that,\" he  said; and his voice sounded queer to Kazan.          CHAPTER II    INTO THE NORTH      Wonderful days followed for Kazan. He missed the forests and deep snows.  He missed the daily strife of keeping his team-mates in trace, the  yapping at his heels, the straight long pull over the open spaces and  the barrens. He missed the \"Koosh--koosh--Hoo-yah!\" of the driver, the  spiteful snap of his twenty-foot caribou-gut whip, and that yelping and  straining behind him that told him he had his followers in line. But  something had come to take the place of that which he missed. It was in  the room, in the air all about him, even when the girl or his master was  not near. Wherever she had been, he found the presence of that strange  thing that took away his loneliness. It was the woman scent, and  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#1)"],[1,"GREAT EVENTS BY FAMOUS HISTORIANS    VOLUME II    A COMPREHENSIVE AND READABLE ACCOUNT OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY.

AN OUTLINE NARRATIVE      TRACING BRIEFLY THE CAUSES, CONNECTIONS, AND CONSEQUENCES OF    THE GREAT EVENTS    (FROM THE RISE OF GREECE TO THE CHRISTIAN ERA)    CHARLES F. HORNE, Ph.D.      Earth's upward struggle has been baffled by so many stumbles that  critics have not been lacking to suggest that we do not advance at all,  but only swing in circles, like a squirrel in its cage. Certain it is  that each ancient civilization seemed to bear in itself the seeds of its  own destruction. Yet it may be held with equal truth that each new  power, rising above the ruins of the last, held something nobler, was  borne upward by some truth its rival could not reach.    At no period is this more evident than in the five centuries immediately  preceding the Christian era. Persia, Greece, Carthage, Rome, each in  turn was with some justice proclaimed lord of the world; each in turn  felt the impulse of her glory and advanced rapidly in culture and  knowledge of the arts; and each in turn succumbed to the temptations  that beset unlimited success. They degenerated not only in physical  strength, but in moral honesty.    Let us recognize, however, that the term \"world-ruler\" as applied to  even the greatest of these nations has but a restricted sense. When the  Persian monarch called himself lord of the sun and moon, he only meant  in a figurative way that he was acquainted with no other king so  powerful as himself; that beyond his own dominions he heard only of  feeble colonies, and beyond those the wilderness. Alexander, when he  sighed for more worlds to conquer, had in reality made himself lord of  less than a quarter of Asia and of about one-sixtieth part of Europe.    No man and no nation has ever yet been intrusted with the government of  the entire globe. None has proved sufficiently fitted for the giant  task. Each empire has been, as it were, but an experiment; and beyond  the border line of seas and deserts which ringed each boastful  conqueror, there were always other races developing along slower, and it  may be surer, lines.    In those old days our world was in truth too big for conquest. Armies  marched on foot. Provisions could not be carried in any quantity, unless  a general clung to the sea-shore and depended on his ships. What  Alexander might with more truth have sighed for, was some modern means  of swift transportation, possessed of which he might still have enjoyed  many interesting, bloody battles in more distant lands.    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREEKS    Taking the idea \"world power\" in the restricted sense suggested, Persia  lost it to Greece at Salamis. As the Asiatic hordes fled behind their  panic-stricken king, the Greeks, looking round their limited horizon,  could see no power that might vie with them. The idea of pressing home  their success and overthrowing the entire unwieldy Persian empire was at  once conceived.    But the Greeks were of all races least like to weld earth into one  dominion. They could not even unite among themselves. In short it cannot  be too emphatically pointed out that the work of Greece was not to  consolidate, but to separate, to teach the value of each individual man.  Asia had made monarchies in plenty. King after king had passed in  splendid, glittering pomp across her plains, circled by a crowd of  obsequious courtiers, trampling on a nameless multitude of slaves.  Europe was to make democracies, or at least to try her hand at them.    It has been well said that a democracy is the strongest government for  defence, the weakest for attack. Every little Greek city clung jealously  to its own freedom, and to its equally obvious right to dominate its  neighbors. The supreme danger of the Persian invasion united them for a  moment; but as soon as safety was assured, they recommenced their  bickering. Sparta with her record of ancient leadership, Athens with her  new-won glory against the common foe, each tried to draw the other  cities in her train. There was no one man who could dominate them all  and concentrate their strength against the enemy. So for a time Persia  continued to exist; she even by degrees regained something of her former  influence over the divided cities.    Among these Athens held the foremost rank. She was, as we have  previously seen, far more truly representative of the Greek spirit than  her rival. Sparta was aristocratic and conservative; Athens democratic  and progressive. The genius of her leaders gathered the lesser towns  into a great naval league, in which she grew ever more powerful. Her  allies sank to be dependent and unwilling vassals, forced to contribute  large sums to the treasury of their overlord.    This was the age of Pericles.[1] As Athens became wealthy, her citizens  became cultured. Statues, temples, theatres made the city beautiful.  Dramatists, orators, and poets made her intellectually renowned. A  marvellous outburst, this of Athens! Displaying for the first time in  history the full capacity of the human mind! Had there been similar  flowerings of genius amid forgotten Asiatic times? One doubts it; doubts  if such brilliancy could ever anywhere have passed, and left no clearer  record of its triumphs.    [Footnote 1: See _Pericles Rules in Athens_, page 12.]    Amid such splendor it seems captious to point out the flaw. Yet Athenian  and all Greek civilization did ultimately decline. It represented  intellectual, but not moral culture. The Greeks delighted intensely in  the purely physical life about them; they had small conception of  anything beyond. To enjoy, to be successful, that was all their goal;  the means scarce counted. The Athenians called Aristides the Just; but  so little did they honor his high rectitude that they banished him for a  decade. His title, or it may have been his insistence on the subject,  bored them.    His rival, Themistocles, was more suited to their taste, a clever scamp,  who must always be dealing with both sides in every quarrel, and  outwitting both. Athens was driven to banish him also at last, at his  too flagrant treachery. But he was not dismissed with the scathing scorn  our modern age would heap upon a traitor. He was sent regretfully, as  one turns from a charming but too persistently lawless friend. The  banishment was only for ten years, and he had his nest already prepared  with the Persian King. If you would understand the Greek spirit in its  fullest perfection, study Themistocles. Rampant individualism, seeking  personal pleasure, clamorous for the admiration of its fellows, but not  restrained from secret falsity by"]]]
