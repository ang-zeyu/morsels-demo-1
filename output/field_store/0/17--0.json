BY \"ATTICUS\" (A. HEWITSON).    'T is pleasant through the loopholes of retreat to peep at such a  world.--Cowper.    Reprinted from the Preston Chronicle.    PRINTED AT THE \"CHRONICLE\" OFFICE, FISHERGATE, PRESTON. 1869.        TO THE READER.        The general satisfaction given by the following sketches when  originally printed in the Preston Chronicle, combined with a desire,  largely expressed, to see them republished, in book form, is the  principal excuse offered for the appearance of this volume. Into the  various descriptions of churches, chapels, priests, parsons,  congregations, &c., which it contains, a lively spirit, which may be  objectionable to the phlegmatic, the sad-faced, and the puritanical,  has been thrown. But the author, who can see no reason why a \"man  whose blood is warm within\" should \"sit like his grandsire cut in  alabaster,\" on any occasion, has a large respect for cheerfulness,  and has endeavoured to make palatable, by a little genial humour,  what would otherwise have been a heavy enumeration of dry facts.  Those who don't care for the gay will find in these sketches the  grave; those who prefer vivacity to seriousness will meet with what  they want; those who appreciate all will discover each. The solemn  are supplied with facts; the facetious with humour; the analytical  with criticism. The work embodies a general history of each place of  worship in Preston--fuller and more reliable than any yet published;  and for reference it will be found valuable, whilst for general  reading it will be instructive. The author has done his best to be  candid and impartial. If he has failed in the attempt, he can't help  it; if he has succeeded, he is thankful. No writer can suit  everybody; and if an angel had compiled these sketches some men  would have croaked. To the generality of the Church of England,  Catholic, and Dissenting clergymen, &c., in the town, the author  tenders his warmest thanks for the generous manner they have  assisted him, and the kindly way in which they have supplied him  with information essential to the completion of the work.

It is important that something should be known about our churches  and chapels; it is more important that we should be acquainted with  their parsons and priests; it is most important that we should have  a correct idea of their congregations, for they show the  consequences of each, and reflect the character and influence of  all. We have a wide field before us. The domain we enter upon is  unexplored. Our streets, with their mid-day bustle and midnight sin;  our public buildings, with their outside elaboration and inside  mysteries; our places of amusement, with their gilded fascinations  and shallow delusions; our clubs, bar parlours, prisons, cellars,  and workhouses, with their amenities, frivolities, and severities,  have all been commented upon; but the most important of our  institutions, the best, the queerest, the solemnest, the oddest--the  churches and chapels of the town--have been left out in the cold  entirely. All our public functionaries have been viewed round,  examined closely, caressed mildly, and sometimes genteely  maltreated; our parochial divinities, who preside over the fate of  the poor; our municipal Gogs and Magogs who exhibit the extreme  points of reticence and garrulity in the council chamber; our brandy  drinkers, chronic carousers, lackered swells, pushing shopkeepers,  otiose policemen, and dim-looking cab-drivers have all been  photographed, framed, and hung up to dry long ago; our workshops and  manufactories, our operatives and artisans, have likewise been duly  pictured and exhibited; the Ribble has had its praises sung in  polite literary strains; the parks have had their beauties depicted  in rhyme and blank verse; nay--but this is hardly necessary--the old  railway station, that walhallah of the gods and paragon of the five  orders of architecture, has had its delightful peculiarities set  forth; all our public places and public bodies have been thrown upon  the canvas, except those of the more serious type--except places of  worship and those belonging them. These have been neglected; nobody  has thought it worth while to give them either a special blessing or  a particular anathema.    There are about 45 churches and chapels and probably 60 parsons and  priests in Preston; but unto this hour they have been treated, so  far as they are individually concerned, with complete silence. We  purpose remedying the defect, supplying the necessary criticism, and  filling up the hiatus. The whole lot must have either something or  nothing in them, must be either useful or useless; parsons must be  either sharp or stupid, sensible or foolish; priests must be either  learned or illiterate, either good, bad, or indifferent; in all,  from the rector in his silken gown to the back street psalm-singer  in his fustian, there must be something worth praising or  condemning. And the churches and chapels, with their congregations,  must likewise present some points of beauty or ugliness, some traits  of grace or godlessness, some features of excellence, dignity,  piety, or sham. There must be either a good deal of gilded  gingerbread or a great let of the genuine article, at our places of  worship. But whether there is or there is not, we have decided to  say something about the church and the chapel, the parson and the  priest, of each district in the town. This is a mere prologue, and  we shall but hint at the general theme \"on this occasion.\"    Churches and chapels are great institutions in the land. Nobody  knows the exact time when the first was thought of; and it has not  yet transpired when the last will be run up. But this is certain, we  are not improving much in the make of them. The Sunday sanctums and  Sabbath conventicles of today may be mere ornate, may be more  flashy, and show more symptoms of polished bedizenment in their  construction; but three-fourths of them sink into dwarflings and  mediocrities when compared with the rare old buildings of the past.  In strength and beauty, in vastness of design and skill of  workmanship, in nobility of outline and richness of detail, the  religious fabrics of these times fall into insignificance beside  their grand old predecessors; and the manner in which they are cut  up into patrician and plebeian quarters, into fashionable coteries  for the perfumed portion of humanity, and into half-starved benches  with the brand of poverty upon them for the poor, is nothing to the  credit of anybody.    All the churches and chapels of the land may profess Christianity;  but the game of the bulk has a powerful reference to money. Those  who have got the most of the current coin of the realm receive the  blandest smile from the parson, the politest nod from the beadle,  the promptest attention from that strange mixture of piety and pay  called \"the chapel-keeper;\" those who have not got it must take what  they can get, and accept it with Christian resignation, as St. Paul  tells them. This may be all right; we have not said yet that it is  wrong; but it looks suspicious, doesn't it?--shows that in the arena  of conventional Christianity, as in the seething maelstrom of  ordinary life, money is the winner. Our parsons and priests, like  our ecclesiastical architecture and general church management, do  not seem to have improved upon their ancestors. Priests are not as  jolly as they once were. In olden days \"holy fathers\" could wear  horse-hair shirts and scarify their epidermis with a finer cruelty  than their modern successors, and they could, after all that, make  the blithest songs, sing the merriest melodies, and quaff the oldest  port with an air of jocund conscientiousness, making one slyly like  them, however much inclined to dispute the correctness of their  theology. And the parsons of the past were also a blithesome set of  individuals. They were perhaps rougher than those mild and refined  gentlemen who preach now-a-days; but they were straightforward,  thorough, absolutely English, well educated, and stronger in the  brain than"]]]
