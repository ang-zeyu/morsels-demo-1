A HISTORY OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY      SURENDRANATH DASGUPTA        VOLUME I    First Edition: Cambridge, 1922        DEDICATION    The work and ambition of a life-time is herein humbly  dedicated with supreme reverence to the great sages  of India, who, for the first time in history, formulated  the true principles of freedom and devoted themselves  to the holy quest of truth and the final assessment  and discovery of the ultimate spiritual essence of  man through their concrete lives, critical thought,  dominant will and self-denial.        NOTE ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF  TRANSLITERATED SANSKRIT  AND PALI WORDS      The vowels are pronounced almost in the same way  as in Italian, except that the sound of _a_ approaches  that of _o_ in _bond_ or _u_ in _but_, and _a_ that of _a_ as in _army_.  The consonants are as in English, except _c_, _ch_ in church;  _@t_, _@d_, _@n_ are cerebrals, to which English _t_, _d_, _n_ almost  correspond; _t_, _d_, _n_ are pure dentals; _kh_, _gh_, _ch_, _jh_,  _@th_, _@dh_, _th_, _dh_, _ph_, _bh_ are the simple sounds plus an  aspiration; _n_ is the French _gn_; _@r_ is usually pronounced  as _ri_, and _s'_, _@s_ as _sh_.        PREFACE    The old civilisation of India was a concrete unity of many-sided  developments in art, architecture, literature, religion, morals, and  science so far as it was understood in those days. But the most important  achievement of Indian thought was philosophy. It was regarded as the goal  of all the highest practical and theoretical activities, and it indicated  the point of unity amidst all the apparent diversities which the complex  growth of culture over a vast area inhabited by different peoples produced.    It is not in the history of foreign invasions, in the rise of independent  kingdoms at different times, in the empires of this or that great monarch  that the unity of India is to be sought. It is essentially one of  spiritual aspirations and obedience to the law of the spirit, which were  regarded as superior to everything else, and it has outlived all the  political changes through which India passed.    The Greeks, the Huns, the Scythians, the Pathans and the Moguls who  occupied the land and controlled the political machinery never ruled  the minds of the people, for these political events were like hurricanes  or the changes of season, mere phenomena of a natural or physical order  which never affected the spiritual integrity of Hindu culture. If after  a passivity of some centuries India is again going to become creative it  is mainly on account of this fundamental unity of her progress and  civilisation and not for anything that she may borrow from other  countries. It is therefore indispensably necessary for all those who  wish to appreciate the significance and potentialities of Indian culture  that they should properly understand the history of Indian philosophical  thought which is the nucleus round which all that is best and highest in  India has grown. Much harm has already been done by the circulation of  opinions that the culture and philosophy of India was dreamy and abstract.  It is therefore very necessary that Indians as well as other peoples  should become more and more acquainted with the true characteristics  of the past history of Indian thought and form a correct estimate of its  special features.    But it is not only for the sake of the right understanding of India    viii    that Indian philosophy should be read, or only as a record of the past  thoughts of India. For most of the problems that are still debated in  modern philosophical thought occurred in more or less divergent forms  to the philosophers of India. Their discussions, difficulties and  solutions when properly grasped in connection with the problems of our  own times may throw light on the course of the process of the future  reconstruction of modern thought. The discovery of the important features  of Indian philosophical thought, and a due appreciation of their full  significance, may turn out to be as important to modern philosophy as  the discovery of Sanskrit has been to the investigation of modern  philological researches. It is unfortunate that the task of  re-interpretation and re-valuation of Indian thought has not yet been  undertaken on a comprehensive scale. Sanskritists also with very few  exceptions have neglected this important field of study, for most of  these scholars have been interested more in mythology, philology, and  history than in philosophy. Much work however has already been done in  the way of the publication of a large number of important texts, and  translations of some of them have also been attempted. But owing to the  presence of many technical terms in advanced Sanskrit philosophical  literature, the translations in most cases are hardly intelligible to  those who are not familiar with the texts themselves.    A work containing some general account of the mutual relations of the  chief systems is necessary for those who intend to pursue the study  of a particular school. This is also necessary for lay readers interested  in philosophy and students of Western philosophy who have no inclination  or time to specialise in any Indian system, but who are at the same time  interested to know what they can about Indian philosophy. In my two books  _The Study of Patanjali_ and _Yoga Philosophy in relation to other Indian  Systems of Thought_ I have attempted to interpret the Saemkhya and Yoga  systems both from their inner point of view and from the point of view  of their relation to other Indian systems. The present attempt deals with  the important features of these as also of all the other systems and seeks  to show some of their inner philosophical relations especially in regard  to the history of their development. I have tried to be as faithful to  the original texts as I could and have always given the Sanskrit or Pali  technical terms for the help of those who want to make this book a guide    ix    for further study. To understand something of these terms is indeed  essential for anyone who wishes to be sure that he is following the actual  course of the thoughts.    In Sanskrit treatises the style of argument and methods of treating the  different topics are altogether different from what we find in any modern  work of philosophy. Materials had therefore to be collected from a large  number of works on each system and these have been knit together and  given a shape which is likely to be more intelligible to people  unacquainted with Sanskritic ways of thought. But at the same time I  considered it quite undesirable to put any pressure on Indian thoughts  in order to make them appear as European. This will explain much of what  might appear quaint to a European reader. But while keeping all the  thoughts and expressions of the Indian thinkers I have tried to arrange  them in a systematic whole in a manner which appeared to me strictly  faithful to their clear indications and suggestions. It is only in very  few places that I have translated some of the Indian terms by terms of  English philosophy, and this I did because it appeared to me that those  were approximately the nearest approach to the Indian sense of the term.  In all other places I have tried to choose words which have not been made  dangerous by the acquirement of technical senses. This however is  difficult, for the words which are used in philosophy always acquire  some sort of technical sense. I would therefore request my readers to  take those words in an unsophisticated sense and associate them with  such meanings as are justified by the passages and contexts in which  they are used. Some of what will appear as obscure in any system may I  hope be removed if it is re-read with care and attention, for  unfamiliarity sometimes stands in the way of right comprehension. But  I may have also missed giving the proper suggestive links in many places  where condensation was inevitable and the systems themselves have also  sometimes insoluble difficulties, for no system of philosophy is without  its dark and uncomfortable corners.    Though I have begun my work from the Vedic and Brahma@nic stage, my  treatment of this period has been very slight. The beginnings of the  evolution of philosophical thought, though they can be traced in the  later Vedic hymns, are neither connected nor systematic.    x      More is found in the Brahmanas, but I do not think it worth while to  elaborate the broken shreds of thought of this epoch. I could have dealt  with the Upani@sad period more fully, but many works on the subject have  already been published in Europe and those who wish to go into details  will certainly go to them. I have therefore limited myself to the dominant  current flowing through the earlier Upani@sads. Notices of other currents  of thought will be given in connection with the treatment of other systems  in the second volume with which they are more intimately connected. It  will be noticed that my treatment of early Buddhism is in some places of  an inconclusive character. This is largely due to the inconclusive  character of the texts which were put into writing long after Buddha  in the form of dialogues and where the precision and directness required  in philosophy were not contemplated. This has given rise to a number of  theories about the interpretations of the philosophical problems of early  Buddhism among modern Buddhist scholars and it is not always easy to  decide"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12975"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

The Author keeps his promises, given  in the following paragraphs some time ago:    \"It would be very idle to pretend, my dear Fritz, that in printing my  letters, I had not some hope of doing the public a trifling service.  There are errors which need only to be mentioned, to be frowned upon;  and there are virtues, which an approving word, even of a stranger,  will encourage. Both of these objects belong to my plan; yet my  strictures shall not be personal, or invidious. It will be easy,  surely, to carry with me the sympathies of all sensible people, in  a little harmless ridicule of the foibles of the day, without citing  personal instance; and it will be vastly easier, in such Babylon as  ours, to designate a virtue, without naming its possessor! Still,  you know me too well, to believe that I shall be frightened out of  free, or even caustic remark, by any critique of the papers, or by  any dignified frown of the literary coteries of the city.... This  LORGNETTE of mine will range very much as my whim directs. In  morals, it will aim to be correct; in religion, to be respectful; in  literature, modest; in the arts, attentive; in fashion, observing; in  society, free; in narrative, to be honest; in advice, to be sound; in  satire, to be hearty; and in general character, whatever may be  the critical opinions of the small litterateurs, or the hints of  fashionable patrons, to be only--itself.\"           *       *       *       *       *    TENNYSON'S NEW POEM.[1]    The popularity of TENNYSON, in this country as well as in England,  is greater than that of any other contemporary who writes verses in  our language. We by no means agree to the justness of the common  apprehension in this case. We think Bryant is a greater poet, and we  might refer to others, at home and abroad, whom it delights us more  to read. But it is unquestionable that Tennyson is the favorite of the  hour, and every new composition of his will therefore be looked  for with the most lively interest. His last work, just reprinted by  TICKNOR, REED & FIELDS, of Boston, is thus described in the London  _Spectator_ of June 8th:      \"'IN MEMORIAM.'    \"Although only these words appear on the title-page of this volume of  poetry, it is well known to be from the pen of Alfred Tennyson. It is  also known that the inscription        'IN MEMORIAM          A.H.H.    OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII.'    refers to Mr. Arthur Hallam, a son of the historian. It may be  gleaned from the book, that the deceased was betrothed to a sister of  Tennyson, while the friendship on the poet's part has 'passed the love  of women.' Feeling, especially in one whose vocation it is to express  sentiments, is not, indeed, always to be measured by composition;  since the earnest artist turns everything to account, and when his  theme is mournful it is his cue to make it as mournful as he can:  but when a thought continually mingles with casual observation, or  incident of daily life, or larger event that strikes attention, as  though the memory of the past were ever coloring the present, and that  over a period of seventeen years, it must be regarded as a singular  instance of enduring friendship, as it has shown itself in a very  singular literary form. There is nothing like it that we remember,  except the sonnets of Petrarch; for books of sportive and ludicrous  conceits are not to be received into the same category.    \"The volume consists of one hundred and twenty-nine separate poems,  numbered but not named, and which in the absence of a more specific  designation may be called occasional; for though they generally bear  a reference to the leading subject, _In Memoriam_, yet they are not  connected with sufficient closeness to form a continuous piece. There  is also an invocatory introduction, and a closing marriage poem,  written on the wedding of one of the writer's sisters, which, strange  as it may seem, serves again to introduce the memory of the departed.  The intervening poems are as various as a miscellaneous collection;  but the remembrance of the dead ever mingles with the thought of  the living. His birth-day, his death-day, the festive rejoicings of  Christmastide and the New Year, recall him; the scenes in which he was  a companion, the house where he was a welcome guest, the season when  the lawyer's vacation gave him leisure for a long visit, revive him  to the mind. The Danube, on whose banks he died--the Severn, by  whose banks he appears to have been buried--nay, the points of  the compass--are associated with him. Sometimes the association is  slighter still; and in a few pieces the allusion is so distant that it  would not have been perceived without the clew. Such is the following  (one of several poems) on the New Year.        CIV.      Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,      The flying cloud, the frosty light:      The year is dying in the night;    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.      Ring out the old, ring in the new,      Ring, happy bells, across the snow:      The year is going, let him go;    Ring out the false, ring in the true.      Ring out the grief that saps the mind,      For those that here we see no more;      Ring out the feud of rich and poor,    Ring in redress to all mankind.      Ring out a slowly dying cause,      And ancient forms of party strife;      Ring in the nobler modes of life,    With sweeter manners, purer laws.      Ring out the want, the care, the sin,      The faithless coldness of the times;      Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,    But ring the fuller minstrel in.      Ring out false pride in place and blood,      The civic slander and the spite;      Ring in the love of truth and right,    Ring in the common love of good.      Ring out old shapes of foul disease,      Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;      Ring out the thousand wars of old,    Ring in the thousand years of peace.      Ring in the valiant man and free,      The larger heart, the kindlier hand;      Ring out the darkness of the land,    Ring in the Christ that is to be.    \"The following is of more direct bearing on the theme, and is moreover  one of those charming pieces of domestic painting in which Tennyson  excels.        LXXXVII.      Witch-elms that counterchange the floor      Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright;      And thou, with all thy breadth and height    Of foliage, towering sycamore;      How often, hither wandering down,      My Arthur found your shadows fair.      And shook to all the liberal air    The dust and din and steam of town:      He brought an eye for all he saw;      He mixt in all our simple sports;      They pleased him, fresh from brawling courts    And dusky purlieus of the law.      O joy to him in this retreat,      Immantled in ambrosial dark,      To drink the cooler air, and mark    The landscape winking through the heat:      O sound to rout the brood of cares,      The sweep of scythe in morning dew,      The gust that round the garden flew,    And tumbled half the mellowing pears!      O bliss, when all in circle drawn      About him, heart and ear were fed      To hear him, as he lay and read    The Tuscan poets on the lawn:      Or in the all-golden afternoon      A guest, or happy sister, sung,      Or here she brought the harp and flung    A ballad to the brightening moon:      Nor less it pleased in livelier moods,      Beyond the bounding hill to stray.      And break the livelong summer day    With banquet in the distant woods;      Whereat we glanced from theme to theme,      Discuss'd the books to love or hate,      Or touch'd the changes of the state,    Or threaded some Socratic dream;      But if I praised the busy town,      He loved to rail against it still,      For 'ground' in yonder social mill    We rub each other's angles down.      'And merge,' he said, 'in form and loss      The picturesque of man and man.'      We talk'd: the stream beneath us ran,    The wine-flask lying couch'd in moss,      Or cool'd within the glooming wave;      And last, returning from afar,      Before the crimson-circled star    Had fallen into her father's grave.      And brushing ankle-deep in flowers,      We heard behind the woodbine vail      The milk that bubbled in the pail,    And buzzings of the honeyed hours.      \"The volume is pervaded by a religious feeling, and an ardent  aspiration for the advancement of society,--as may be gathered from  our first quotation. These two sentiments impart elevation, faith,  and resignation; so that memory, thought, and a chastened tenderness,  generally predominate over deep grief. The grave character of the  theme forbids much indulgence in conceits such as Tennyson sometimes  falls into, and the execution is more finished than his volumes always  are: there are very few prosaic lines, and few instances of that  excess of naturalness which degenerates into the mawkish. The nature  of the plan--which, after all, is substantially though not in form a  set of sonnets on a single theme--is favorable to those pictures of  common landscape and of daily life, redeemed from triviality by genial  feeling and a perception of the lurking beautiful, which are the  author's distinguishing characteristic. The scheme, too, enables him  appropriately to indulge in theological and metaphysical reflections;  where he is not quite so excellent. Many of the pieces taken"]]]
