SILVIA                      Soprano.          PLOT OF THE OPERA         Silvia is the rich and beautiful hostess of a country hotel, who has     been besieged by lovers of almost every description, she repulses them     all, because although they may be well-to-do and even wealthy and     powerful, they have not pleased her fancy or awakened her heart. At     last she forswears love entirely, being convinced that her destiny is     to remain single.       Still, she remembers a youth she once saw, and believes that he lives     near by, in Florence, toward which city she idly looks out in the     summer evening from the veranda of her hotel, placed on the side of a     steep mountain.       As she looks she hears the voice of a roving minstrel who is     approaching. She conceals herself. He comes near, and not venturing to     enter the hotel, lies down to sleep on a bench. He is soon asleep; and     Silvia comes near to see him. She recognizes in him her ideal; and at     once loves him. She wakes him up, and he sees in her the madonna of     his dreams.       He is fond of his freedom, and of his own way of living; but thinks it     would be nice to have a home, and a sister. This does not suit Silvia;     who then conceals her identity; and says that she is a widow, and very     poor; and cannot possibly entertain a wandering poet. After several     refusals, he tells her that he has heard of Silvia, who is also     beautiful, as well as rich, and liberal. He asks his newly-beloved     to help him find her. She advises him not to go, that she would do     anything to save him from his danger. Although both love each other     she is unwilling to let herself be known. He believes in her sincerity;     and offers to go in any direction she may point out. She points toward     the dawn; he dashes toward it; she watches him till out of sight; then     burying her face in her hands exclaims:           Blessed art thou, O Love!         Now can I weep again!       The allegorical sense of the plot is that the sweet minstrel, love,     comes once; and if not frankly and honestly received, he goes away;     and may never come again. Another is, that true love is willing to     sacrifice itself in order that its ideal may achieve its high     ambition.          INTRODUCTION--CHORUS WITHOUT WORDS.      SCENE FIRST    Silvia, alone.    (Silvia, draped in white, leans on the balcony and contemplates the  surrounding country).      SILVIA.       Maladetto l'amore!     Non ho più lacrime.       (lentamente)          Against love are my curses;          I've no tears any more.          (descending slowly)       Son la crudel signora     Che ognun sempre adorò     Che ognuno adora     Ognun col labbro     Rispetta; sfiora     La mia man; ma l'ardore     Del bacio non salì     Fino al mio core!       M'uccide il tedio       Le silenziose     Chiare notti d'estate     Che paion fatte     Per le serenate     Danno a' poeti il destro     Di sfogar l'estro       Ed in onor mio       Dispiegan l'ali       Scipiti madrigali.          I am that cruel lady,          Whom all must adore;          But I love no one.        On lips I'm everywhere respected;          They're asking for my hand,            But the ardor of kisses          I do not understand!          Drowning is tedious.          Here in the silence          Quiet night to awaken          There should be couplets          For serenading;          Bad 'tis for a poet          To give out his fire;          Yet still, to my ire          They will be singing,          Stupid madrigals ringing.       Il soldato, il mercante, il podestà ai piè mi gittan loro       Ma disprezzo costoro         E la lor vanità       Soffro; viver così,         Senza un amor         Viver non è.          The soldier, and the merchant          All who have power,          On me treasures shower,          But contempt I still hold          Both for them and the gold          Suffer I, my life thus to give,          For without love          Life is not fit to live.        I have no recollection          Of affection genteel.       (addita la città) Non mi ricorda un fiore qualche affetto gentil.     Firenze splende laggiù, lontana, sereno, e tende forse, lo sguardo al     cielo un giovanetto che m'ha vista una volta, e sente in petto battere     il cor per me, l'indegna. Se a traversa la mia strada fatal si trovi.     Oh! non isperi di fuggirsene via, e non sarò la sola disgraziata.          (pointing to the city)        Now there is Florence, in splendor, lying in the distance, and        having, perhaps, a youth who's looking up to this same heaven; he        who once I saw, and who in his breast felt heart-beats for me, for        me unworthy. Just to cross my pathway, he found it fatal! I've no        hope now, but to run away from him. I must not stay here and be        disgraced.    ZANETTO (Sings in the distance)       Cuore, come un fiore     Si dischiude, in te l'amore     La canzon non è gioconda     L'odi tu, piccina bionda!       Cuore, v'è il dolore     Tra il profumo e la splendore     Par che il pianto si nasconda     In quel fior piccina bionda?          Heart of mine, as a flower,        Is found in thee love's secret power.        Not merry now the song I'm singing        Know'st thou to thee its way it's winging!          Heart of mine, why from weeping        Comes the perfume, true love keeping,        Think you grieving all unbidden        In the flower can be hidden?    SILVIA.       Dolce è la melodia: la voce tocca il cuor. Ma queste fole d'amore io     non l'intendo più.       (Sale lentamente su la terazza, volgendosi distrattamente verso la     parte da veniva la voce Zanetto col liuto a tracolla, e trascinando     per l'erta il mantello, entra con aria allegra senza veder Silvia)          Sweet is thy lovely singing.        Thy voice has touched my heart,        But this folly of foolish loving        Will not be on my part.          (Goes slowly up the terrace, turning absently toward the direction        whence came the voice. Zanetto with a lute on his shoulder, and        dragging his cloak up the steep, enters with a happy air, without        seeing Silvia).      SCENE SECOND    Silvia and Zanetto.      ZANETTO.         Le notti estive     Ridono al viaggio       E si va della luna     Al chiaro raggio       Ma di lassù le stelle     Infondono coraggio       Con le pupille d'or.             Son giunto, Ama Fiorenze           Il suono del liuto           E la canzon d'amor?     Non posso in questa arnese     Picchiare alla locanda del paese           Mi converrà dormire           All'aria aperta.       (Si sdraia sulla panca avvolgendosi nel mantello)       (Silvia scende rapidamente dalla terrazza)          Sweet nights of summer,        By the moon lighted,        Smiles, on my journey,        On me benighted.        The stars too above        Shed on me their light        From golden eyes bright.          I'm ready--Loves my Florence        The sound of the lute?        And songs of true love?        As a minstrel I'm dressed,        And not in such plight        Could I appear        In hotel candle light        Here to sleep I will lay me        This warm summer night.          (He stretches himself out on a bench and wraps his cloak around        him).          (Silvia comes quickly down from the terrace).    SILVIA.       Oh poveretto, ed io che avevo in uggia questa serenità! Debbo     chiamarlo ed ospitalità debbo offrir? Ma che! Dorme di già.     (guardando Zanetto addormentato)          O poor little fellow! If I only had such sweet tranquility! Shall I        call him, and offer him hospitality? but then--Just sleep down        there!        (looking at him sleeping)       Il silenzio, il profumo della sera questo fanciul dormente, mi turban     forse? Un palpito novo m'agita il core. Ahimè!       Somiglia al sogno mio!       Su! Destati!       (prendendolo con dolcezza per la mano)       (Zanetto si sveglia e guarda Silvia con adorazione e meraviglia)          The silence, the perfumed air of the evening, this sleeping boy.        Why should they disturb me? Yet a new palpitation is moving my        heart! Ah me!          He's like my dream, exactly!          Up! Wake up!          (taking him sweetly by the hand)          (Zanetto awakes and looks at Silvia with wonder and admiration).    ZANETTO.       La bianca visione che in sogno mi ridea.          The lovely white vision        I saw in my dreaming.    SILVIA.       Bambino! Solo un pallido raggio di stella l'occhio tuo vedea.          O darling!        'Twas but a pale ray        From a star, bright seeming.    ZANETTO.       No, no, tu sei la bella realtà del mio sogno:     Questa voce divina     L'udivo a me vicina!          No, no! You were the lovely angel of my dream.          Your voice I heard near me;          Ah, you do not fear me!    SILVIA.       Son, se ti piace, un ospite gradita al viandante.          I am, if it please you, a hostess; and welcoming a wayfarer.    ZANETTO.       (guardandola)     Grazie. Ho cenato tardi,     e il sonno mi svanì.          Thank you, I've just had my supper--        And my sleep is all gone.    SILVIA (to herself).       Silvia sii buona!     È l'amor tuo funesto     Ed un fanciullo è questo.

His eyes twinkled with mischief, and he hurried as  only Billy can. As he passed Jerry Muskrat's house, Jerry saw him.    \"Hi, Billy Mink! Where are you going in such a hurry this fine morning?\"  he called.    \"To find Little Joe Otter. Have you seen anything of him?\" replied  Billy.    \"No,\" said Jerry. \"He's probably down to the Big River fishing. I heard  him say last night that he was going.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Billy Mink, and without waiting to say more he was off  like a little brown flash.    Jerry watched him out of sight. \"Hump!\" exclaimed Jerry. \"Billy Mink is  in a terrible hurry this morning. Now I wonder what he is so anxious to  find Little Joe Otter for. When they get their heads together, it is  usually for some mischief.\"    Jerry climbed to the top of his house and looked over the Smiling Pool  in the direction from which Billy Mink had just come. Almost at once he  saw Grandfather Frog fast asleep on his big green lily-pad. The legs of  a foolish green fly were sticking out of one corner of his big mouth.  Jerry couldn't help laughing, for Grandfather Frog certainly did look  funny.    \"He's had a good breakfast this morning, and his full stomach has made  him sleepy,\" thought Jerry. \"But he's getting careless in his old age.  He certainly is getting careless. The idea of going to sleep right out  in plain sight like that!\"    Suddenly a new thought popped into his head. \"Billy Mink saw him, and  that is why he is so anxious to find Little Joe Otter. He is planning to  play some trick on Grandfather Frog as sure as pollywogs have tails!\"  exclaimed Jerry. Then his eyes began to twinkle as he added: \"I think  I'll have some fun myself.\"    Without another word Jerry slipped down into the water and swam over to  the big green lily-pad of Grandfather Frog. Then he hit the water a  smart blow with his tail. Grandfather Frog's big goggly eyes flew open,  and he was just about to make a frightened plunge into the Smiling Pool  when he saw Jerry.    \"Have a nice nap?\" inquired Jerry, with a broad grin.    \"I wasn't asleep!\" protested Grandfather Frog indignantly. \"I was just  thinking.\"    \"Don't you think it a rather dangerous plan to think so long with your  eyes closed?\" asked Jerry.    \"Well, maybe I did just doze off,\" admitted Grandfather Frog sheepishly.    \"Maybe you did,\" replied Jerry. \"Now listen.\" Then Jerry whispered in  Grandfather Frog's ear, and both chuckled as if they were enjoying some  joke, for they are great friends, you know. Afterward Jerry swam back to  his house, and Grandfather Frog closed his eyes so as to look just as he  did when he was asleep.    Meanwhile Billy Mink had hurried down the Laughing Brook. Half-way to  the Big River he met Little Joe Otter bringing home a big fish, for you  know Little Joe is a great fisherman. Billy Mink hastened to tell him  how Grandfather Frog had fallen fast asleep on his big green lily-pad.    \"It's a splendid chance to have some fun with Grandfather Frog and give  him a great scare,\" concluded Billy.    Little Joe Otter put his fish down and grinned. He likes to play pranks  almost as well as he likes to go fishing.    \"What can we do?\" said he.    \"I've thought of a plan,\" replied Billy. \"Do you happen to know where we  can find Longlegs the Blue Heron?\"    \"Yes,\" said Little Joe. \"I saw him fishing not five minutes ago.\"    Then Billy told Little Joe his plan, and laughing and giggling, the two  little scamps hurried off to find Longlegs the Blue Heron.          II    LONGLEGS THE BLUE HERON RECEIVES CALLERS      Longlegs the Blue Heron felt decidedly out of sorts. It was a beautiful  morning, too beautiful for any one to be feeling that way. Indeed, it  was the same beautiful morning in which Grandfather Frog had caught so  many foolish green flies.    Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was smiling his broadest. The Merry Little  Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were dancing happily here and there over  the Green Meadows, looking for some good turn to do for others. The  little feathered people to whom Old Mother Nature has given the great  blessing of music in their throats were pouring out their sweetest  songs. So it seemed as if there was no good reason why Longlegs should  feel out of sorts. The fact is the trouble with Longlegs was an empty  stomach. Yes, Sir, that is what ailed Longlegs the Blue Heron that  sunshiny morning. You know it is hard work to be hungry and happy at the  same time.    So Longlegs stood on the edge of a shallow little pool in the Laughing  Brook, grumbling to himself. Just a little while before, he had seen  Little Joe Otter carrying home a big fish, and this had made him  hungrier and more out of sorts than ever. In the first place it made him  envious, and envy, you know, always stirs up bad feelings. He knew  perfectly well that Little Joe had got that fish by boldly chasing it  until he caught it, for Little Joe can swim even faster than a fish. But  Longlegs chose to try to make himself think that it was all luck.  Moreover, he wanted to blame some one for his own lack of success, as  most people who fail do. So when Little Joe had called out: \"Hi,  Longlegs, what luck this fine morning?\" Longlegs just pretended not to  hear. But when Little Joe was out of sight and hearing, he began to  grumble to himself.    \"No wonder I have no luck with that fellow racing up and down the  Laughing Brook,\" said he. \"He isn't content to catch what he wants  himself, but frightens the rest of the fish so that an honest fisherman  like me has no chance at all. I don't see what Old Mother Nature was  thinking of when she gave him a liking for fish. He and Billy Mink are  just two worthless little scamps, born to make trouble for other  people.\"    He was still grumbling when these two same little scamps poked their  heads out of the grass on the other side of the little pool. \"You look  happy, Longlegs. Must be that you have had a good breakfast,\" said  Little Joe, nudging Billy Mink.    Longlegs snapped his great bill angrily. \"What are you doing here,  spoiling my fishing?\" he demanded. \"Haven't you got the Big River and  all the rest of the Laughing Brook to fool around in? This is my pool,  and I'll thank you to keep away!\"    Billy Mink chuckled so that Longlegs heard him, and that didn't improve  his temper a bit. But before he could say anything more, Little Joe  Otter spoke.    \"Oh,\" said he, \"we beg your pardon. We just happen to know that  Grandfather Frog is sound asleep, and we thought that if you hadn't had  good luck this morning, you might like to know about it. As long as you  think so ill of us, we'll just run over and tell Blackcap the Night  Heron.\"    Little Joe turned as if to start off in search of Blackcap at once.  \"Hold on a minute!\" called Longlegs, and tried to make his voice sound  pleasant, a difficult thing to do, because, you know, his voice is very  harsh and disagreeable. \"The truth is, I haven't had a mouthful of  breakfast and to be hungry is apt to make me cross. Where did you say  Grandfather Frog is?\"    \"I didn't say,\" replied Little Joe, \"but if you really want to know, he  is sitting on his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool fast asleep  right in plain sight.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Longlegs. \"I believe I have an errand up that way, now  I think of it. I believe I'll just go over and have a look at him. I  have never seen him asleep.\"    [Illustration: \"Thank you,\" said Longlegs. \"I believe I have an errand  up that way.\" _Page 10_.]     "]]]
