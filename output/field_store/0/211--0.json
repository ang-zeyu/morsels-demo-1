The success which attended the publication of the First Edition of  this Treatise, on \"The Laws of War, affecting Commerce and Shipping,\"  has confirmed the author's opinion of the utility of such a work; and  its hearty acceptance by the mercantile world has induced him to add  largely and materially to this edition. The general plan of the former  work has not been departed from in the first portion of the present;  and although a great number of fresh and popular topics have been here  touched upon, the author has endeavoured to preserve (as far as was  consistent with accuracy), that concise and popular character which he  believes in no small degree contributed to the favourable reception of  the first edition.    An Introduction has also been added, discussing the origin of the Laws  of War generally, and the utility of the work has been enhanced by an  Index for facilitating reference.    In a Second Part, which will shortly appear, the Author proposes to  treat of the Laws of War relating to the Army, Navy, and the Militia,  as well as the administration of the bodies governing those various  sections of the war force of the country.

It would be superfluous to trouble my readers, in a concise practical  treatise, with any theoretical discussion on the origin of the Law of  Nations, had not questions of late been often asked, respecting the  means of accommodating rules decided nearly half-a-century ago, to  those larger views of international duty and universal humanity, that  have been the natural result of a long Peace, and general progress.    To commence with the question, Who is the international legislator? it  must be observed, that there is no general body that can legislate on  this subject; no parliament of nations that can discuss and alter the  law already defined. The Maritime Tribunals of maritime states always  have been, and still are, almost the sole interpreters and mouthpieces  of the International Law. Attempts that have been made by our own  parliaments, by individual sovereigns, and even by congressional  assemblies of the ministers of European powers, to create new  universal laws, have been declared by these courts to be invalid, and  of no authority. And though it is distinctly laid down, that the Law  of Nations forms a part of the Common Law of England, yet it is not  subject to change by Act of Parliament, as other portions of the  Common Law are; except so far as Parliament can change the form,  constitution, and persons of the courts that declare the law.    Lord Stowell says         \"No British Act of Parliament, nor any commission founded       upon it, can affect the rights or interests of foreigners,       unless they are founded upon principles, and impose       regulations, that are consistent with the Law of Nations.\"    And in another place--         \"Much stress has been laid upon the solemn declaration of       the eminent persons (the ministers of the European powers),       assembled in Congress (at Vienna). Great as the reverence       due to such authorities may be, they cannot, I think, be       admitted to have the force of over-ruling the established       course of the general Law of Nations.\"    It is to the Maritime Courts, then, of this and other countries, that  the hopes of civilization must look for improvement and advance in the  canons of international intercourse during the unhappy time of war.  The manner, and the feeling in which they are to pronounce those  canons cannot be more finely enunciated than in the words of Lord  Stowell himself.         \"I consider myself as stationed here, not to deliver       occasional and shifting opinions to serve present purposes       of particular national interest, but to administer with       indifference that justice which the _Law of Nations_ holds       out, without distinction, to independent states, some       happening to be neutral, and some belligerent.         \"The seat of judicial authority is indeed locally _here_ in       the belligerent country, according to the known law and       practice of nations; _but the law itself has no locality_.       It is the duty of the person who sits here to determine this       question exactly as he would determine the same question, if       sitting at Stockholm; to assert no pretensions on the part       of Great Britain, which he would not allow to Sweden in the       same circumstances; and to impose no duties on Sweden, as a       neutral country, which he would not admit to belong to       _Great Britain_, in the same character. If, therefore, I       mistake the law in this matter, I mistake that which I       consider, and which I mean should be considered, as       UNIVERSAL LAW upon the question.\"    When an Admiralty Judge investigates the law in this impartial spirit,  he occupies the grand position of being in some respects the director  of the deeds of nations; but with equal certainty does the taint of an  unjust bias poison all his authority; his judgments are powerful then  only for evil; they bind no one beyond the country in which he sits,  and may become the motive and origin of reprisal and attack upon his  native land.    As the authority of the international judge depends on his integrity,  so also does the universal law arise from, and remain supported by,  the true principles of right and justice; in other words, by the  fundamental distinction between right and wrong. A statute, a despotic  prerogative, and an established principle of common law, rest upon  different sanctions. They may be the causes of the greatest injustice,  may sow the seeds of national ruin, and yet may even require  revolutions for their reformation; but any one of the laws of nations  preserves its vitality, only with the essential truth of its  principles; a change in the feeling of mankind on the great question  of real justice, destroys it, and it simply remains an historical  record of departed opinion, or a point from which to date an advance  or retreat in the career of the human mind.    It is for this reason that International Law has been so differently  defined by writers at various periods.    The Law of Nations is _founded_, I have said, on the general  principles of right and justice, on the broad fundamental distinctions  between right and wrong, or as Montesquieu defines it, \"on the  principle that nations ought in time of peace to do each as much good,  and in time of war as little harm as possible.\" These are the  principles from which any rule must be shown to spring, before it can  be said to be a rule for international guidance. But what are the  principles of right and wrong? These are not left to the individual  reason of the interpreter of the law for the time being, but are to be  decided by the _public opinion of the civilized world_, as it stands  at the time when the case arises.    It may immediately be asked--How is that public opinion to be  ascertained? The answer is--By ascertaining the _differences_ in  opinion between the present and the past. For this purpose it must be  observed, that the views of a past age are easily ascertainable, in  matters of law, from theoretical writings, history, and judicial  decisions; and these views may be reduced to definition. Modern  universal intelligence will either agree or disagree in these views.  In the mass of instances it will agree, as progress on such points is  at all times slow; and not only will the points of _disagreement_ be  few, but they will be salient, striking, and generally of popular  notoriety. Present, universal, or international opinion, has therefore  two portions. 1. That in which it accords with the views of a past  generation, that has become historical. 2. That in which it differs  from, or contradicts those views.    In the first instance, then, we are to ascertain what _were_ the  principles of right and justice, from any materials handed down to us;  and if those principles agree with, or support the practical rules  recorded by the same, or similar sources of information, such are to  be accepted as belonging to the code of the Laws of Nations, as far as  those principles are uncontradicted by modern opinion.    In the second instance, those differences which may either overrule,  add to, or complete the public opinion of a past age, are to be  ascertained, (by those in whose hands such decisions rest,) by looking  to the _wish_ of nations on these points; and this wish may be  exhibited in various ways; either by a universal abandonment of a  given law, in its non-execution by any nation whatever, for a length  of time; by numerous treaties, to obtain by convention an improvement  not yet declared by international tribunals; or by extending to the  relations and duties of nations, the improvements in the general  principles of right and justice, that are at the time being applied to  the concerns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#1)"],[1,"THORNDYKE'S CASES    RELATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.    AND EDITED BY R.

[Illustration: PROFESSOR POPPELBAUM IS ENLIGHTENED.]      TO MY FRIEND    FRANK STANDFIELD    IN MEMORY OF MANY A PLEASANT EVENING  SPENT WITH MICROSCOPE AND CAMERA  THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED          PREFACE      The stories in this collection, inasmuch as they constitute a somewhat  new departure in this class of literature, require a few words of  introduction. The primary function of all fiction is to furnish  entertainment to the reader, and this fact has not been lost sight of.  But the interest of so-called \"detective\" fiction is, I believe, greatly  enhanced by a careful adherence to the probable, and a strict avoidance  of physical impossibilities; and, in accordance with this belief, I have  been scrupulous in confining myself to authentic facts and practicable  methods. The stories have, for the most part, a medico-legal motive, and  the methods of solution described in them are similar to those employed  in actual practice by medical jurists. The stories illustrate, in fact,  the application to the detection of crime of the ordinary methods of  scientific research. I may add that the experiments described have in  all cases been performed by me, and that the micro-photographs are, of  course, from the actual specimens.    I take this opportunity of thanking those of my friends who have in  various ways assisted me, and especially the friend to whom I have  dedicated this book; by whom I have been relieved of the very  considerable labour of making the micro-photographs, and greatly  assisted in procuring and preparing specimens. I must also thank Messrs.  Pearson for kindly allowing me the use of Mr. H. M. Brock's admirable  and sympathetic drawings, and the artist himself for the care with which  he has maintained strict fidelity to the text.    R. A. F.    Gravesend,  _September 21, 1909_.

Far from any railway, and some miles distant from any  considerable town, it remains an outpost of civilization, in which  primitive manners and customs and old-world tradition linger on into an  age that has elsewhere forgotten them. In the summer, it is true, a  small contingent of visitors, adventurous in spirit, though mostly of  sedate and solitary habits, make their appearance to swell its meagre  population, and impart to the wide stretches of smooth sand that fringe  its shores a fleeting air of life and sober gaiety; but in late  September--the season of the year in which I made its acquaintance--its  pasture-lands lie desolate, the rugged paths along the cliffs are seldom  trodden by human foot, and the sands are a desert waste on which, for  days together, no footprint appears save that left by some passing  sea-bird.    I had been assured by my medical agent, Mr. Turcival, that I should find  the practice of which I was now taking charge \"an exceedingly soft  billet, and suitable for a studious man;\" and certainly he had not  misled me, for the patients were, in fact, so few that I was quite  concerned for my principal, and rather dull for want of work. Hence,  when my friend John Thorndyke, the well-known medico-legal expert,  proposed to come down and stay with me for a weekend and perhaps a few  days beyond, I hailed the proposal with delight, and welcomed him with  open arms.    \"You certainly don't seem to be overworked, Jervis,\" he remarked, as we  turned out of the gate after tea, on the day of his arrival, for a  stroll on the shore. \"Is this a new practice, or an old one in a state  of senile decay?\"    \"Why, the fact is,\" I answered, \"there is virtually no practice.  Cooper--my principal--has been here about six years, and as he has  private means he has never made any serious effort to build one up; and  the other man, Dr. Burrows, being uncommonly keen, and the people very  conservative, Cooper has never really got his foot in. However, it  doesn't seem to trouble him.\"    \"Well, if he is satisfied, I suppose you are,\" said Thorndyke, with a  smile. \"You are getting a seaside holiday, and being paid for it. But I  didn't know you were as near to the sea as this.\"    We were entering, as he spoke, an artificial gap-way cut through the low  cliff, forming a steep cart-track down to the shore. It was locally  known as Sundersley Gap, and was used principally, when used at all, by  the farmers' carts which came down to gather seaweed after a gale.    \"What a magnificent stretch of sand!\" continued Thorndyke, as we reached  the bottom, and stood looking out seaward across the deserted beach.  \"There is something very majestic and solemn in a great expanse of  sandy shore when the tide is out, and I know of nothing which is capable  of conveying the impression of solitude so completely. The smooth,  unbroken surface not only displays itself untenanted for the moment, but  it offers convincing testimony that it has lain thus undisturbed through  a considerable lapse of time. Here, for instance, we have clear evidence  that for several days only two pairs of feet besides our own have  trodden this gap.\"    \"How do you arrive at the 'several days'?\" I asked.    \"In the simplest manner possible,\" he replied. \"The moon is now in the  third quarter, and the tides are consequently neap-tides. You can see  quite plainly the two lines of seaweed and jetsam which indicate the  high-water marks of the spring-tides and the neap-tides respectively.  The strip of comparatively dry sand between them, over which the water  has not risen for several days, is, as you see, marked by only two sets  of footprints, and those footprints will not be completely obliterated  by the sea until the next spring-tide--nearly a week from to-day.\"    \"Yes, I see now, and the thing appears obvious enough when one has heard  the explanation. But it is really rather odd that no one should have  passed through this gap for days, and then that four persons should have  come here within quite a short interval of one another.\"    \"What makes you think they have done so?\" Thorndyke asked.    \"Well,\" I replied, \"both of these sets of footprints appear to be quite  fresh, and to have been made about the same time.\"    \"Not at the same time, Jervis,\" rejoined Thorndyke. \"There is certainly  an interval of several hours between them, though precisely how many  hours we cannot judge, since there has been so little wind lately to  disturb them; but the fisherman unquestionably passed here not more than  three hours ago, and I should say probably within an hour; whereas the  other man--who seems to have come up from a boat to fetch something of  considerable weight--returned through the gap certainly not less, and  probably more, than four hours ago.\"    I gazed at my friend in blank astonishment, for these events befell in  the days before I had joined him as his assistant, and his special  knowledge and powers of inference were not then fully appreciated by me.    \"It is clear, Thorndyke,\" I said, \"that footprints have a very different  meaning to you from what they have for me. I don't see in the least how  you have reached any of these conclusions.\"    \"I suppose not,\" was the reply; \"but, you see, special knowledge of this  kind is the stock-in-trade of the medical jurist, and has to be acquired  by special study, though the present example is one of the greatest  simplicity. But let us consider it point by point; and first we will  take this set of footprints which I have inferred to be a fisherman's.  Note their enormous size. They should be the footprints of a giant. But  the length of the stride shows that they were made by a rather short  man. Then observe the massiveness of the soles, and the fact that there  are no nails in them. Note also the peculiar clumsy tread--the deep toe  and heel marks, as if the walker had wooden legs, or fixed ankles and  knees. From that character we can safely infer high boots of thick,  rigid leather, so that we can diagnose high boots, massive and stiff,  with nailless soles, and many sizes too large for the wearer. But the  only boot that answers this description is the fisherman's  thigh-boot--made of enormous size to enable him to wear in the winter  two or three pairs of thick knitted stockings, one over the other. Now  look at the other footprints; there is a double track, you see, one set  coming from the sea and one going towards it. As the man (who was  bow-legged and turned his toes in) has trodden in his own footprints, it  is obvious that he came from the sea, and returned to it. But observe  the difference in the two sets of prints; the returning ones are much  deeper than the others, and the stride much shorter. Evidently he was  carrying something when he returned, and that something was very heavy.  Moreover, we can see, by the greater depth of the toe impressions, that  he was stooping forward as he"]]]
