A MIDNIGHT SUMMONS      \"When did you last hear from Nayland Smith?\" asked my visitor.    I paused, my hand on the syphon, reflecting for a moment.    \"Two months ago,\" I said; \"he's a poor correspondent and rather soured,  I fancy.\"    \"What--a woman or something?\"    \"Some affair of that sort. He's such a reticent beggar, I really know  very little about it.\"    I placed a whisky and soda before the Rev. J. D. Eltham, also sliding  the tobacco jar nearer to his hand. The refined and sensitive face of  the clergy-man offered no indication of the truculent character of the  man. His scanty fair hair, already gray over the temples, was silken and  soft-looking; in appearance he was indeed a typical English churchman;  but in China he had been known as \"the fighting missionary,\" and had  fully deserved the title. In fact, this peaceful-looking gentleman had  directly brought about the Boxer Risings!    \"You know,\" he said, in his clerical voice, but meanwhile stuffing  tobacco into an old pipe with fierce energy, \"I have often wondered,  Petrie--I have never left off wondering--\"    \"What?\"    \"That accursed Chinaman! Since the cellar place beneath the site of the  burnt-out cottage in Dulwich Village--I have wondered more than ever.\"    He lighted his pipe and walked to the hearth to throw the match in the  grate.    \"You see,\" he continued, peering across at me in his oddly nervous way,  \"one never knows, does one? If I thought that Dr. Fu-Manchu lived; if  I seriously suspected that that stupendous intellect, that wonderful  genius, Petrie, er--\" he hesitated characteristically--\"survived, I  should feel it my duty--\"    \"Well?\" I said, leaning my elbows on the table and smiling slightly.    \"If that Satanic genius were not indeed destroyed, then the peace of the  world, may be threatened anew at any moment!\"    He was becoming excited, shooting out his jaw in the truculent manner I  knew, and snapping his fingers to emphasize his words; a man composed of  the oddest complexities that ever dwelt beneath a clerical frock.    \"He may have got back to China, Doctor!\" he cried, and his eyes had the  fighting glint in them. \"Could you rest in peace if you thought that he  lived? Should you not fear for your life every time that a night-call  took you out alone? Why, man alive, it is only two years since he was  here among us, since we were searching every shadow for those awful  green eyes! What became of his band of assassins--his stranglers, his  dacoits, his damnable poisons and insects and what-not--the army of  creatures--\"    He paused, taking a drink.    \"You--\" he hesitated diffidently--\"searched in Egypt with Nayland Smith,  did you not?\"    I nodded.    \"Contradict me if I am wrong,\" he continued; \"but my impression is that  you were searching for the girl--the girl--Karamaneh, I think she was  called?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied shortly; \"but we could find no trace--no trace.\"    \"You--er--were interested?\"    \"More than I knew,\" I replied, \"until I realized that I had--lost her.\"    \"I never met Karamaneh, but from your account, and from others, she was  quite unusually--\"    \"She was very beautiful,\" I said, and stood up, for I was anxious to  terminate that phase of the conversation.    Eltham regarded me sympathetically; he knew something of my search with  Nayland Smith for the dark-eyed, Eastern girl who had brought romance  into my drab life; he knew that I treasured my memories of her as I  loathed and abhorred those of the fiendish, brilliant Chinese doctor who  had been her master.    Eltham began to pace up and down the rug, his pipe bubbling furiously;  and something in the way he carried his head reminded me momentarily of  Nayland Smith. Certainly, between this pink-faced clergyman, with his  deceptively mild appearance, and the gaunt, bronzed, and steely-eyed  Burmese commissioner, there was externally little in common; but it was  some little nervous trick in his carriage that conjured up through the  smoky haze one distant summer evening when Smith had paced that very  room as Eltham paced it now, when before my startled eyes he had rung up  the curtain upon the savage drama in which, though I little suspected it  then, Fate had cast me for a leading role.    I wondered if Eltham's thoughts ran parallel with mine. My own were  centered upon the unforgettable figure of the murderous Chinaman. These  words, exactly as Smith had used them, seemed once again to sound in my  ears: \"Imagine a person tall, lean, and feline, high shouldered, with a  brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven skull, and  long magnetic eyes of the true cat green. Invest him with all the cruel  cunning of an entire Eastern race accumulated in one giant intellect,  with all the resources of science, past and present, and you have a  mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the 'Yellow Peril' incarnate in one  man.\"    This visit of Eltham's no doubt was responsible for my mood; for this  singular clergyman had played his part in the drama of two years ago.    \"I should like to see Smith again,\" he said suddenly; \"it seems a pity  that a man like that should be buried in Burma. Burma makes a mess of  the best of men, Doctor. You said he was not married?\"    \"No,\" I replied shortly, \"and is never likely to be, now.\"    \"Ah, you hinted at something of the kind.\"    \"I know very little of it. Nayland Smith is not the kind of man to talk  much.\"    \"Quite so--quite so! And, you know, Doctor, neither am I; but\"--he was  growing painfully embarrassed--\"it may be your due--I--er--I have a  correspondent, in the interior of China--\"    \"Well?\" I said, watching him in sudden eagerness.    \"Well, I would not desire to raise--vain hopes--nor to occasion, shall  I say, empty fears; but--er... no, Doctor!\" He flushed like a girl--\"It  was wrong of me to open this conversation. Perhaps, when I know  more--will you forget my words, for the time?\"    The telephone bell rang.    \"Hullo!\" cried Eltham--\"hard luck, Doctor!\"--but I could see that he  welcomed the interruption. \"Why!\" he added, \"it is one o'clock!\"    I went to the telephone.    \"Is that Dr. Petrie?\" inquired a woman's voice.    \"Yes; who is speaking?\"    \"Mrs. Hewett has been taken more seriously ill. Could you come at once?\"    \"Certainly,\" I replied, for Mrs. Hewett was not only a profitable  patient but an estimable lady--\"I shall be with you in a quarter of an  hour.\"    I hung up the receiver.    \"Something urgent?\" asked Eltham, emptying his pipe.    \"Sounds like it. You had better turn in.\"    \"I should much prefer to walk over with you, if it would not be  intruding. Our conversation has ill prepared me for sleep.\"    \"Right!\" I said; for I welcomed his company; and three minutes later we  were striding across the deserted common.    A sort of mist floated amongst the trees, seeming in the moonlight like  a veil draped from trunk to trunk, as in silence we passed the Mound  pond, and struck out for the north side of the common.    I suppose the presence of Eltham and the irritating recollection of his  half-confidence were the responsible factors, but my mind persistently  dwelt upon the subject of Fu-Manchu and the atrocities which he had  committed during his sojourn in England. So actively was my imagination  at work that I felt again the menace which so long had hung over me; I  felt as though that murderous yellow cloud still cast its shadow upon  England. And I found myself longing for the company of Nayland Smith.  I cannot state what was the nature of Eltham's reflections, but I can  guess; for he was as silent as I.    It was with a conscious effort that I shook myself out of this morbidly  reflective mood, on finding that we had crossed the common and were come  to the abode of my patient.    \"I shall take a little walk,\" announced Eltham; \"for I gather that you  don't expect to be detained long? I shall never be out of sight of the  door, of course.\"    \"Very well,\" I replied, and ran up the steps.    There were no lights to be seen in any of the windows, which  circumstance rather surprised me, as my patient occupied, or had  occupied when last I had visited her, a first-floor bedroom in the front  of the house. My knocking and ringing produced no response for three or  four minutes; then, as I persisted, a scantily clothed and half  awake maid servant unbarred the door and stared at me stupidly in the  moonlight.    \"Mrs. Hewett requires me?\" I asked abruptly.    The girl stared more stupidly than ever.    \"No, sir,\" she said, \"she don't, sir; she's fast asleep!\"    \"But some one 'phoned me!\" I insisted, rather irritably, I fear.    \"Not from here, sir,\" declared the now wide-eyed girl. \"We haven't got a  telephone, sir.\"    For a few moments I stood there, staring as foolishly as she; then  abruptly I turned and descended the steps. At the gate I stood looking  up and down the road. The houses were all in darkness. What could be the  meaning of the mysterious summons? I had made no mistake respecting the  name of my patient; it had been twice repeated over the telephone; yet  that the call had not emanated from Mrs. Hewett's house was now palpably  evident. Days had been when I should have regarded the episode as  preluding some outrage, but to-night I felt more disposed to ascribe it  to a silly practical joke.    Eltham walked up briskly.    \"You're in demand to-night, Doctor,\" he said. \"A young person called  for you almost directly you had left your house, and, learning where you  were gone, followed you.\"    \"Indeed!\" I said, a trifle incredulously. \"There are plenty of other  doctors if the case is an urgent one.\"    \"She may have thought it would save time as you were actually up and  dressed,\" explained Eltham; \"and the house is quite near to here, I  understand.\"    I looked at him a little blankly. Was this another effort of the unknown  jester?    \"I have been fooled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11863"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration]      In the large corner house, on the right of the Engraving, SAMUEL  JOHNSON was born on the 18th of September, N.S. 1709. We learn from  Boswell, that the house was built by Johnson's father, and that the  two fronts, towards Market and Broad Market-street stood upon waste  land of the Corporation of Lichfield, under a forty years lease; this  expired in 1767, when on the 15th of August, \"at a common hall of the  bailiffs and citizens, it was ordered, (and that without any  solicitation,) that a lease should be granted to Samuel Johnson,  Doctor of Laws, of the incroachments at his house, for the term of  ninety-nine years, at the old rent, which was five shillings. Of  which, as town clerk, Mr. Simpson had the honour and pleasure of  informing him, and that he was desired to accept it, without paying  any fine on the occasion, which lease was afterwards granted, and the  doctor died possessed of this property.\"[1]        [1] Note to Boswell's Life of Johnson, 2nd edition, vol. iii.          p. 646.    In the above house, the doctor's father Michael Johnson, a native of  Derbyshire, of obscure extraction, settled as a bookseller and  stationer. He was diligent in business, and not only \"kept shop\" at  home, but, on market days, frequented several towns in the  neighbourhood,[2] some of which were at a considerable distance from  Lichfield. \"At that time booksellers' shops in the provincial towns of  England were very rare, so that there was not one even in Birmingham,  in which town old Mr. Johnson used to open a shop every market-day. He  was a pretty good Latin scholar, and a citizen so creditable as to be  made one of the magistrates of Lichfield; and, being a man of good  sense and skill in his trade, he acquired a reasonable share of  wealth, of which, however, he afterwards lost the greatest part, by  engaging unsuccessfully in the manufacture of parchment.\"[3] This  failure is attributed to the dishonesty of a servant; but it is  observable in connexion with an incident in Dr. Johnson's literary  history, which has not escaped the keen eye of Mr. Croker, the  ingenious annotator of Boswell's _Life_ of the great lexicographer.[4]        [2] To show the great estimation in which the father of our          great moralist was held, we may quote a letter, dated          \"Trentham, St. Peter's Day, 1716,\" written by the Rev.          George Plaxton, then chaplain to Lord Gower:--\"Johnson,          the Lichfield librarian, is now here. He propagates          learning all over this diocese, and advanceth knowledge to          its just height. All the clergy here are his pupils, and          suck all they have from him; Allen cannot make a warrant          without his precedent, nor our quondam John Evans draw a          recognizance _sine directione Michaelis_.\"--_Gent. Mag.          Oct. 1791_.        [3] Boswell, vol. i. p. 14.        [4] Johnson, in his Dictionary, defines EXCISE \"a hateful tax,          levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by the _common          judges_ of property, but by _wretches_ hired by those to          whom excise is paid;\" and, in the _Idler_ (No. 65) he          calls a _commissioner of excise_ \"one of the _lowest_ of          all human beings.\" This violence of language seems so          little reasonable, that the editor was induced to suspect          some cause of _personal animosity_; this mention of the          trade in parchment (an _excisable_ article) afforded a          clue, which has led to the confirmation of that suspicion.          In the records of the Excise Board is to be found the          following letter, addressed to the supervisor of excise at          Lichfield:--\"July 27, 1725--The commissioners received          yours of the 22nd instant; and since the justices would          not give judgment against Mr. Michael Johnson, the          _tanner_, notwithstanding the facts were fairly against          him, the board direct that the next time he offends, you          do not lay an information against him, but send an          affidavit of the fact, that he may be prosecuted in the          Exchequer.\" It does not appear whether he offended again,          but here is sufficient cause of his son's animosity          against commissioners of excise, and of the allusion in          the Dictionary to the _special_ jurisdiction under which          that revenue is administered. The reluctance of the          justices to convict will not appear unnatural, when it is          recollected that Mr. Johnson was, _this very year_, chief          magistrate of the city.--_Note to Boswell, by Croker_,          vol. i.    Johnson's mother was a woman of distinguished understanding and piety;  and to her must be ascribed those early impressions of religion upon  the mind of her son, from which the world afterwards derived so much  benefit. Johnson was the elder of two sons, the younger of whom died  in his infancy.    Of Johnson's childhood at Lichfield it would not be difficult to  assemble many interesting particulars: from his listening to Dr.  Sacheverel, when he was but three years old; his being first taught to  read English by Dame Oliver, a widow who kept a school for young  children in Lichfield, and who gave him a present of gingerbread, and  said he was the best scholar she ever had; to his arrival in London  with the unfinished tragedy of _Irene_ in his pocket, and the prospect  of a slender engagement with Cave of the _Gentleman's Magazine_. One  thing is certain, that however unpromising were Johnson's early days  at Lichfield, he ever retained a warm affection for his native city,  and which, by a sudden apostrophe, under the word _Lich_, he  introduces with reverence into his immortal work, the ENGLISH  DICTIONARY: _Salve magna parens. (Boswell.)_ His last visit was in his  75th year when he writes to Boswell:--\"I came to Lichfield, and found  every body glad enough to see me.\"    The annexed view is of the date 1785, being from the first volume of  the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for that year. The building to the extreme  left is part of the market-cross, erected by dean Denton, but replaced  some years since by a light brick building. The church is that of St.  Mary, one of the three parishes into which Lichfield is divided: it is  a modern structure, of the year 1717, and upon the site of the  original church, said to have been founded in the year 885. In the  extreme distance of the Engraving is seen the Guild or Town Hall, a  neat stone edifice, adorned with the city arms, a bas-relief of the  cathedral, &c.           *       *       *       *       *        ANECDOTE GALLERY.           *       *       *       *       *      CLASSICAL ANECDOTES OF CONTINENCE IN MAN.      Many noble instances are recorded by ancient historians of the  practice of this noble virtue; but in the reminiscences of our  youthful studies, there is no incident that occurs with more freshness  to the memory than that of the continence of Scipio Africanus, related  by Livy. It appears that the soldiers of Scipio's army, after the  taking of new Carthage, brought before him a young lady of great  beauty. Scipio inquiring concerning her country and parents,  ascertained that she was betrothed to Allutius, prince of the  Celtiberians. He immediately ordered her parents and bridegroom to be  sent for. In the meantime he was informed that the young prince was so  excessively enamoured of his bride, that he could not survive the loss  of her. For this reason, as soon as he appeared, and before he spoke  to her parents, he took great care to talk with him. \"As you and I are  both young,\" said he, \"we can converse together with greater freedom.  When your bride, who had fallen into the hands of my soldiers, was  brought before me, I was informed that you loved her passionately;  and, in truth, her perfect beauty left me no room to doubt of it. If I  were at liberty to indulge a youthful passion--I mean honourable and  lawful wedlock, and were not solely engrossed by the affairs of my  republic, I might have hoped to have been pardoned my excessive love  for so charming a mistress; but as I am situated, and have it in my  power, with pleasure I promote your happiness. Your future spouse has  met with as civil and modest treatment from me, as if she had been  amongst her own parents, who are soon to be yours too. I have kept her  pure, in order to have it in my power to make you a present worthy of  you and of me.\" The magnanimity of his behaviour did not close here,  for when the parents of the fair captive brought an immense sum of  money to ransom her, they were much surprised at Scipio's noble  conduct, and in the ecstacy of joy and gratitude, they pressed him to  accept it as a token of thankfulness. Scipio, unable to resist their  importunate solicitations, told them he accepted it; but ordering it  to be laid at his feet, he thus addressed Allutius:--\"To the portion  you are to receive from your father-in-law, I add this, and beg you  would accept it as a nuptial present:\" thus exhibiting in the whole  transaction a rare instance of modesty, disinterestedness, and  benevolence, well worthy of imperishable record, as a moral lesson for  mankind.    When Araspes had commended the fair Panthea to Cyrus, as a beauty  worthy his admiration, he replied--\"For that very reason I will not  see her, lest if by thy"]]]
