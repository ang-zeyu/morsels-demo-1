CHAPTER 1    IN MOONFLEET VILLAGE    So sleeps the pride of former days--_More_      The village of Moonfleet lies half a mile from the sea on the right or  west bank of the Fleet stream. This rivulet, which is so narrow as it  passes the houses that I have known a good jumper clear it without a  pole, broadens out into salt marshes below the village, and loses itself  at last in a lake of brackish water. The lake is good for nothing except  sea-fowl, herons, and oysters, and forms such a place as they call in the  Indies a lagoon; being shut off from the open Channel by a monstrous  great beach or dike of pebbles, of which I shall speak more hereafter.  When I was a child I thought that this place was called Moonfleet,  because on a still night, whether in summer, or in winter frosts, the  moon shone very brightly on the lagoon; but learned afterwards that 'twas  but short for 'Mohune-fleet', from the Mohunes, a great family who were  once lords of all these parts.    My name is John Trenchard, and I was fifteen years of age when this story  begins. My father and mother had both been dead for years, and I boarded  with my aunt, Miss Arnold, who was kind to me in her own fashion, but too  strict and precise ever to make me love her.    I shall first speak of one evening in the fall of the year 1757. It must  have been late in October, though I have forgotten the exact date, and I  sat in the little front parlour reading after tea. My aunt had few books;  a Bible, a Common Prayer, and some volumes of sermons are all that I can  recollect now; but the Reverend Mr. Glennie, who taught us village  children, had lent me a story-book, full of interest and adventure,  called the _Arabian Nights Entertainment_. At last the light began to  fail, and I was nothing loth to leave off reading for several reasons;  as, first, the parlour was a chilly room with horse-hair chairs and sofa,  and only a coloured-paper screen in the grate, for my aunt did not allow  a fire till the first of November; second, there was a rank smell of  molten tallow in the house, for my aunt was dipping winter candles on  frames in the back kitchen; third, I had reached a part in the _Arabian  Nights_ which tightened my breath and made me wish to leave off reading  for very anxiousness of expectation. It was that point in the story of  the 'Wonderful Lamp', where the false uncle lets fall a stone that seals  the mouth of the underground chamber; and immures the boy, Aladdin, in  the darkness, because he would not give up the lamp till he stood safe on  the surface again. This scene reminded me of one of those dreadful  nightmares, where we dream we are shut in a little room, the walls of  which are closing in upon us, and so impressed me that the memory of it  served as a warning in an adventure that befell me later on. So I gave up  reading and stepped out into the street. It was a poor street at best,  though once, no doubt, it had been finer. Now, there were not two hundred  souls in Moonfleet, and yet the houses that held them straggled sadly  over half a mile, lying at intervals along either side of the road.  Nothing was ever made new in the village; if a house wanted repair badly,  it was pulled down, and so there were toothless gaps in the street, and  overrun gardens with broken-down walls, and many of the houses that yet  stood looked as though they could stand but little longer.    The sun had set; indeed, it was already so dusk that the lower or  sea-end of the street was lost from sight. There was a little fog or  smoke-wreath in the air, with an odour of burning weeds, and that first  frosty feeling of the autumn that makes us think of glowing fires and  the comfort of long winter evenings to come. All was very still, but I  could hear the tapping of a hammer farther down the street, and walked  to see what was doing, for we had no trades in Moonfleet save that of  fishing. It was Ratsey the sexton at work in a shed which opened on the  street, lettering a tombstone with a mallet and graver. He had been  mason before he became fisherman, and was handy with his tools; so that  if anyone wanted a headstone set up in the churchyard, he went to Ratsey  to get it done. I lent over the half-door and watched him a minute,  chipping away with the graver in a bad light from a lantern; then he  looked up, and seeing me, said:    'Here, John, if you have nothing to do, come in and hold the lantern for  me, 'tis but a half-hour's job to get all finished.'    Ratsey was always kind to me, and had lent me a chisel many a time to  make boats, so I stepped in and held the lantern watching him chink out  the bits of Portland stone with a graver, and blinking the while when  they came too near my eyes. The inscription stood complete, but he was  putting the finishing touches to a little sea-piece carved at the top of  the stone, which showed a schooner boarding a cutter. I thought it fine  work at the time, but know now that it was rough enough; indeed, you may  see it for yourself in Moonfleet churchyard to this day, and read the  inscription too, though it is yellow with lichen, and not so plain as it  was that night. This is how it runs:    SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF DAVID BLOCK    Aged 15, who was killed by a shot fired from the _Elector_ Schooner,  21 June 1757.    Of life bereft (by fell design),    I mingle with my fellow clay.  On God's protection I recline    To save me in the Judgement Day.    There too must you, cruel man, appear,    Repent ere it be all too late;  Or else a dreadful sentence fear,    For God will sure revenge my fate.    The Reverend Mr. Glennie wrote the verses, and I knew them by heart, for  he had given me a copy; indeed, the whole village had rung with the tale  of David's death, and it was yet in every mouth. He was only child to  Elzevir Block, who kept the Why Not? inn at the bottom of the village,  and was with the contrabandiers, when their ketch was boarded that June  night by the Government schooner. People said that it was Magistrate  Maskew of Moonfleet Manor who had put the Revenue men on the track, and  anyway he was on board the _Elector_ as she overhauled the ketch. There  was some show of fighting when the vessels first came alongside of one  another, and Maskew drew a pistol and fired it off in young David's face,  with only the two gunwales between them. In the afternoon of Midsummer's  Day the _Elector_ brought the ketch into Moonfleet, and there was a posse  of constables to march the smugglers off to Dorchester Jail. The  prisoners trudged up through the village ironed two and two together,  while people stood at their doors or followed them, the men greeting them  with a kindly word, for we knew most of them as Ringstave and Monkbury  men, and the women sorrowing for their wives. But they left David's body  in the ketch, so the boy paid dear for his night's frolic.    'Ay, 'twas a cruel, cruel thing to fire on so young a lad,' Ratsey said,  as he stepped back a pace to study the effect of a flag that he was  chiselling on the Revenue schooner, 'and trouble is likely to come to  the other poor fellows taken, for Lawyer Empson says three of them will  surely hang at next Assize. I recollect', he went on, 'thirty years ago,  when there was a bit of a scuffle between the _Royal Sophy_ and the  _Marnhull_, they hanged four of the contrabandiers, and my old father  caught his death of cold what with going to see the poor chaps turned off  at Dorchester, and standing up to his knees in the river Frome to get a  sight of them, for all the countryside was there, and such a press there  was no place on land. There, that's enough,' he said, turning again to  the gravestone. 'On Monday I'll line the ports in black, and get a brush  of red to pick out the flag; and now, my son, you've helped with the  lantern, so come down to the Why Not? and there I'll have a word with  Elzevir, who sadly needs the talk of kindly friends to cheer him, and  we'll find you a glass of Hollands to keep out autumn chills.'    I was but a lad, and thought it a vast honour to be asked to the Why  Not?--for did not such an invitation raise me at once to the dignity of  manhood. Ah, sweet boyhood, how eager are we as boys to be quit of thee,  with what regret do we look back on thee before our man's race is  half-way run! Yet was not my pleasure without alloy, for I feared even to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

In 1902 the distinguished American artist Howard Pyle undertook to retell  and illustrate the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round  Table. His four-volume work has long been considered one of the outstanding  interpretations of the Arthur cycle.    _The Story of the Champions of the Round Table_, the second of Pyle's  volumes, was originally published in 1905. Reissued now, identical in  format to the original volume, with Pyle's superb illustrations and  decorations, it is destined to reach new generations of readers. _The Story  of the Champions of the Round Table_ recounts the full and moving saga of  three of Arthur's famous knights: Percival, Tristram, and Launcelot of the  Lake.           *       *       *       *       *    _\"The period in which Howard Pyle did his work frequently has been spoken  of as that Golden Age in children's literature that was to last for the  decade to follow. It is difficult to do justice to his contribution to the  shining quality of that era. The magnitude and diversity of his work eludes  definition. Creative artist and born storyteller, each aspect of his  twofold genius enriched and interpreted the other.\"_    --Elizabeth Nesbitt, in _A Critical History of Children's Literature_    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot of the Lake]            Foreword    In a book which was written by me aforetime, and which was set forth in  print, I therein told much of the history of King Arthur; of how he  manifested his royalty in the achievement of that wonderful magic sword  which he drew forth out of the anvil; of how he established his royalty; of  how he found a splendid sword yclept Excalibur in a miraculously wonderful  manner; of how he won the most beautiful lady in the world for his queen;  and of how he established the famous Round Table of noble worthy knights,  the like of whose prowess the world hath never seen, and will not be likely  ever to behold again.    Also I told in that book the adventures of certain worthy knights and  likewise how the magician Merlin was betrayed to his undoing by a sorceress  hight Vivien.    Now, if you took any joy in reading that book, I have great hope that that  which follows may be every whit as pleasing to you; for I shall hereinafter  have to do with the adventures of certain other worthies with whom you may  have already become acquainted through my book and otherwise; and likewise  of the adventures of certain other worthies, of whom you have not yet been  told by me.    More especially, I believe, you will find entertainment in what I shall  have to tell you of the adventures of that great knight who was altogether  the most noble of spirit, and the most beautiful, and the bravest of heart,  of any knight who ever lived--excepting only his own son, Galahad, who was  the crowning glory of his house and of his name and of the reign of King  Arthur.    However, if Sir Launcelot of the Lake failed now and then in his behavior,  who is there in the world shall say, \"I never fell into error\"? And if he  more than once offended, who is there shall have hardihood to say, \"I never  committed offence\"?    Yea, that which maketh Launcelot so singularly dear to all the world, is  that he was not different from other men, but like other men, both in his  virtues and his shortcomings; only that he was more strong and more brave  and more untiring than those of us who are his brethren, both in our  endeavors and in our failures.
