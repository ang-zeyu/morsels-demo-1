VOL. 13, No. 368.] SATURDAY, MAY 2, 1829. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          CLARENDON HOUSE, PICCADILLY.      [Illustration: CLARENDON HOUSE, PICCADILLY.]      The virtuous and uncompromising chancellor, the Earl of Clarendon, had  a splendid mansion facing the upper end of St. James's-street, on the  site of the present Grafton-street. Of this princely pile, the above  is an accurate engraving. It was built by Clarendon with the stone  intended for the rebuilding of St. Paul's. \"He purchased the  materials,\" says Pennant, \"but a nation soured with an unsuccessful  war, with fire, and with pestilence, imputed everything as a crime to  this great and envied character; his enemies called it Dunkirk House,  calumniating him with having built it with the money arising from the  sale of that town, which had just before been given up to the French,  for a large sum, by his Master.\"    It is true that Clarendon built this mansion in a season of  discontent; but so sensible was he of his vanity and imprudence in  building so large a house, and of the envy it drew upon him, that he  afterwards apologized for the act; which he declares, so far exceeded  the proposed expense, as to add greatly to the embarrassment of his  affairs.    This mansion cost L50,000. and 300 men were employed in the building.  It was purchased from his lordship by George Monk, Duke of Albemarle,  and afterwards by another nobleman, inferior indeed in abilities, but  not inferior in virtues. In 1670, James, Duke of Ormond, resided at  Clarendon House; and on his way thither, he was one day dragged out of  his coach by the infamous Blood and his associates, who intended to  hang his Grace at Tyburn, in revenge for justice done, under his  administration in Ireland, on some of their companions. \"This  refinement in revenge,\" says Pennant, \"saved the duke's life; he had  leisure to disengage himself from the villain on horseback, to whom he  was tied; by which time he was discovered by his servants, and rescued  from death.\"    The original of our Engraving was copied from a rare print, which, in  the year 1790, was in the collection of Thomas Allen, Esq. Appended to  the former is a section, showing the relative situation of Clarendon  House, which was taken from a map of London (supposed to be unique) in  an illustrated _Clarendon's History_, in the possession of John  Charles Crowle, Esq. By the section, the entrance-gate to the  court-yard of the house appears to have been in Piccadilly, in a  direct line with St. James's Street, and the grounds to have extended  to Bruton Street at the back, where there was likewise a  communication. The site of the front gate is now, therefore, the  commencement of _Albemarle Street_, named after one of the  distinguished occupants of Clarendon House.    Notwithstanding the revolutions of time and fashion in this quarter,  the illustrious name of the founder of Clarendon House is still  preserved in the \"_Clarendon Hotel_,\" which occupies a portion of the  original ground already described. One of the changes is, that instead  of the Chancellor meditating upon his dismissal from office, which his  very virtues and stately dignity, and a weak king, and a more wicked  and envious faction had brought about,--we have well-living twos and  fours hob-nobbing over Chateau-Margaux, or yielding to the delightful  inspirations of Ay Champagne. Not a few more of the good things of  this great town are assembled near the same spot. Albemarle Street has  many first-rate hotels, and two handsome club-houses; while on the  Bond Street side of the quadrangle are two or three extensive  libraries, an immense porcelain repository, and a score of fashionable  _artistes_. What idle delights are all these compared with the wisdom  and virtue which once dwelt on the same spot. But had Clarendon lived  to see Crockford's splendid subscription-house rise after a golden  shower, in St. James's Street, (and this he might have done from the  front-windows of Clarendon House) he would, perhaps, have given us an  extra volume of _Essays_. We would that he _had_ so lived, if only  that his sublime truths might thus nave been multiplied for the good  of mankind, if not for the weak heads of St. James's Street.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GLANCIN' E'E.

Illustrious dead! one tributary sigh,    In that great temple where the mighty lie,    I breath'd for you--a magic charm was there    Where rest the great and good, the wise and fair;    Their glittering day of fame has had its close    And beauty, genius, grandeur, there repose.    Immortal names! kings, queens, and statesmen rise    In marble forms before the gazer's eyes.    Cold, pale, and silent, down each lessening aisle    They clustering stand, and mimic life awhile.    The warrior chief, in sculptur'd beauty dies,    And in Fame's clasping arms for ever lies.    \"Each in his place of state,\" the rivals stand,    The senators, who saved a sinking land;    Majestic, graceful,--each with \"lips apart\"    Whose eloquence subdued and won the heart.    Pitt! round thy name how bright a halo burns,    When memory to thy day of glory turns;    And views thee in life's bright meridian lie,    And victim to thy patriot spirit die!    Round Fox's tomb, what forms angelic weep,    And ever watch that chill and marble sleep!    Silence, how eloquent! how deep--profound--    She holds her reign above the hallow'd ground.    Here sceptred monarchs in death's slumbers lie,    Tudors, Plantagenets--they too could die!    Beneath a 'scutcheon'd arch, with banners spread,    Unhappy, murdered, Richard rests his head.    While Pomfret's walls in \"ruin greenly tell,\"    How fought the brave and how the noble fell!    Pale rose of York! thy sanguine rival rears    Full many a tomb, and many a trophy bears.    But who lies here? in marble lovely still,    Here let me pause, and fancy take her fill.    Poor ill-starr'd Mary; Melancholy gloom    And fond regrets are waking o'er thy tomb.    Bright was thy morn of promise, dark the day,    That clos'd thy fate in murderous Fotheringay!    How near thee lies that \"bright star of the west,\"    Elizabeth, of queens the wisest, best;    Her \"lion port,\" and her imperial brow,    The dark grey stone essays in vain to show.    Ye royal rivals of a former day,    How has your love and hatred pass'd away!    To future times how faint the voice of fame,    For greatness here but \"stalks an empty name.\"    Around, above, how sorrow builds her throne,    To snatch from death's embrace each treasure gone.    See, how the horrid phantom bends his bow,    And points his dart to lay that victim low![1]    She sinks, she falls, and her fond husband's breast    Is the cold pillow to that marble rest!    But softly tread upon the sacred ground,    Where Britain's bards lie sepulchred round.    Sons of the muse, who woke the magic spell,    From the deep windings of \"Apollo's shell!\"    Mute is each lyre, their silent strings are bound    With willow, yew, and cypress wreath'd around.    Their hopes, joys, sorrows, rest within the grave    Admiring nations to their relics gave.    Hail, mighty shades! bright spirits of the past;    Here may your ashes sleep while time shall last.    Let kindred genius shed the pensive tear,    And grace with votive elegy each bier.    While far beyond this melancholy vale,    When faded sorrow tells her mournful tale,    \"O'er this dim spot of earth,\" in regions fair    Your spirits dwell, and joys eternal share.

[Illustration: Exeter 'Change, Strand.]      Who has not heard of Exeter 'Change? celebrated all over England for its  menagerie and merchandize--wild beasts and cutlery--kangaroos and fleecy  hosiery--elephants and minikin pins--a strange assemblage of nature and  art--and savage and polished life.    At page 69 of the present volume we have given a brief sketch of the  \"Ancient Site of the Exeter 'Change,\" &c.; showing how the magnificent  house of Burleigh, where Queen Elizabeth deigned to visit her favourite  treasurer--at length became a receptable for uncourtly beasts, birds, and  reptiles, whilst the lower part became a little nation of shopkeepers,  among whom shine conspicuous the parsimony and good fortune of Mr. Clarke,  the cutler, who amassed here a princely fortune. But the march of  improvement having condemned the whole of the building, \"Exeter 'Change is  removed to Charing Cross.\" Mr. Cross's occupation's gone, and the wild  beasts have progressed nearer the Court by removing to the King's Mews.    Surely such a place is worthy of preservation in a graphic sketch for THE  MIRROR. Perhaps its wonders were once the goal of our wishes--to receive a  long bill from the jolly yeoman at the door, to see the living wonders of  the upper story, and be treated with a pocket knife or whistle-whip from  the counters of the lower apartments, have probably at one period or other  been grand treats. Yes, gentle reader, and two doors east of this world of  wonders appeared the early numbers of the present Miscellany.    Among the improvement projects, we hear that a building for the meetings  of public societies is to occupy the above site.           *       *       *       *       *      RECENT BALLOON ASCENT.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)    _June_ 10, 1829.      Sir,--With your permission, I will attempt to describe the magnificent  scene I witnessed on my ascent with Mr. G. Green, in his balloon, on  Wednesday, June 10th, 1829; but I really want the power of language to  depict its grandeur; for no poetic taste, or pencil of man, can unfold  the splendid scene we enjoyed while traversing the ethereal regions.    Having implicit confidence in the skill of Mr. Green I ascended with him  from the Jamaica, Tea-gardens, Rotherhithe, amidst the acclamations of the  multitude, whose forms and voices soon passed away; the busy hum of men  (with us) ceased in a few seconds, and a solemn stillness reigned over the  metropolis. The serenity of the evening threw a degree of solemnity over  the scene, which had the effect of enchantment. We never lost sight of the  earth, for our voyage was perfectly cloudless. The fields and buildings  were all in miniature proportions, though most exquisitely depicted; and  as Greenwich Hospital, the Tower of London, St. Paul's, &c. apparently  receded from our view, the country succeeded, resembling one continued  garden. The fields of wheat, &c. were beautifully defined, and the  clearness of the atmosphere threw a sort of varnish (if I may use the term)  over the whole face of nature. We had the Thames in view the whole of the  time, which appeared like a rivulet of silver; but below Kingston Bridge,  about half an hour after our ascent, the setting sun _gilded_ its surface  with magnificent effect. The boats appeared like little pieces of cork.  The Penitentiary, at Millbank, had the resemblance of a twelfth cake cut  into quarters; St. Paul's and the Tower of London could be distinctly seen,  the light falling happily upon their proportions. Old and New London  Bridges, were like two feeble efforts of the works of man; and here we saw  the triumph of nature over art, and the littleness of the great works of  man. At one time, on nearing Battersea Bridge, we observed a small, black  streak ascending from the surface of the Thames, which we concluded to be  the smoke from a Richmond steam packet. At that time the course of the  balloon was south-east, although the smoke above alluded to was driven  towards the west. The air being so serene we felt no motion in the car,  and we could only know we were quietly moving, from seeing the grappling  irons (which hung from the car) pass over the earth rapidly from field  to field; whilst the scene seemed to recede from our view like a moving  panorama. At our greatest altitude a solemn stillness prevailed, and I  cannot describe its awful grandeur and my excitement. We then let loose a  pigeon, and having a favourable country below, we prepared to descend, and  Mr. Green hailed some men with the cry of \"we are coming down.\" I saw them  run (though very small,) and we fell in a field of wheat, near Kingston,  with scarcely any rebound; in fact a child might have alighted with safety.    Thus, Mr. Editor, ended this short and rapid, but splendid voyage. On our  alighting, Mr. Green wrote on a piece of paper our safe arrival, which he  tied to the neck of a pigeon, and sent him off.    Our greatest altitude did not exceed one mile and a quarter, in  consequence, as Mr. Green informed me, of the density of the atmosphere,  which would, at a greater elevation, have dimmed the splendour of the  scene beneath us.    P.T.W.    [We thank our ingenious Correspondent for the previous description of  his recent aerial voyage, as we are fully aware of the difficulty of  describing such a magnificent scene as he must have witnessed in his  ascent. During the whole voyage, he experienced nothing but sensations  of delight; the atmosphere being only disturbed by very light wind, just  sufficient to waft the aeronauts without any laborious management, and  the time--evening--being beautifully serene. We thought ourselves richly  rewarded by the view of the Colosseum Panorama, but what must have been  their sensations at a distance of 6,600 feet high, when with the huge  machine they appeared little more than a speck. The varnish, or glare,  which our Correspondent describes, was that charming effect which we are  wont to admire here, on earth, in evening scenes, especially when they  are lit up by the splendour of the setting sun; but which must be doubly  enchanting when viewed from so great an altitude. He likewise tells us  that the landscape appeared to recede like a moving panorama, whilst the  balloon seemed to be stationary; so that the scenic attempt at Covent  Garden Theatre, a few years since, to illustrate a balloon ascent, by  moving scenery, was in accordance with the real effect, though, we think,  the theatrical attempt was not so appreciated at the time it was made. In  conclusion, we congratulate our friend upon his splendid recreation, for  such his ascent must have been.]           *       *       *       *       *      PITY.--A FRAGMENT.    (_For the Mirror_.)        What is pity?    'Tis virtue's essence,--'tis benevolence    Itself;--'tis mercy, justice, charity;    It is the rarest boon that man doth give to man;    It is the first perfection of our nature;    It is the brightest attribute of heav'n:    Without it man should rank beneath the brute;    And with it--he is little lower than angel.    The generous mite of penury is pity;    Nay, ev'n a look.--    Not so the heartless pittance of the affluent,    That is hypocrisy. If you pity,    Your heart is liberal to forgive,    Your memory to forget--    Your purse is open, and your hands are free    To help the penniless.

Sir,--From a note which I have just seen at the foot of the interesting  account of the escape of Charles the Second, in vol. v. of the MIRROR, the  reader is led to conclude, that the pension granted to Richard Pendril,  expired at his death. No such thing. Old Dr. Pendril lived, practised,  and died at Alfriston, a little town in the east of Sussex, some forty or  fifty years since. His son, John Pendril, died at Eastbourn, four or five  years ago. His son, Mr. John Pendril, kept a public house at Lewes, a few  years since, to which he added the appropriate sign of the \"Royal Oak.\"  All these in succession enjoyed the pension of ---- marks, granted by  Charles the Second, together with something of a sporting character called  \"free warren.\" The last Mr. John Pendril was lately living at or near  Brighton.    W.W.           *       *       *       *       *      EATING \"MUTTON COLD.\"    (_For the Mirror_.)      Be good enough to insert the solution of _Hen. B_.'s difficulty in your  last MIRROR, which I send at foot, and thereby oblige a constant    SUBSCRIBER AND FRIEND.    The solution, or attempt at solution, of _Hen. B_.'s difficulty as to what  Goldsmith means in his poem \"Retaliation\" when he concludes his ironical  eulogium on Edmund Burke, thus:--      \"In short 'twas his fate, unemployed, or in place, sir,    To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor.\"      By being \"unemployed\" it is presumed that he was not engaged in the  ordinary avocations of life, or in other words was not engaged in those  legitimate avocations which have for their object the procuring the means  of subsistence for the masticator; but if it is meant to have a name of  extensive meaning, the solution is unanswerable.    Assuming the former to be Goldsmith's meaning, the answer to be given to  the solution might be that eating mutton cold, is eating cold mutton in  its cold state, cooked or uncooked; but if the more general meaning is  insisted upon, I cannot see how the masticator is unemployed, as his jaws  which form a most material part of himself--are set in full motion by the  operation of eating--hence full employment is given them--and as much to  the \"he\" who is the owner of such jaws.           *       *       *       *       *          FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *  "]]]
