To attempt to stimulate spontaneous conversation, even on simple  subjects, without the aid of a French model, not only is hazardous  but often becomes aimless, and at best results in the acquisition  of a limited vocabulary. Furthermore, it requires a skilful teacher  to adapt to such purposes the substance of a text prepared with  a totally different end in view.    The author, in the course of five years' experience with conversation  classes in the University of Michigan, had difficulty in finding  material for this work in a form that was adapted peculiarly  to his needs. Plays and anecdotes were found to yield the best  results.    Another need is that of books offering a systematic review of  the first year's work. In every class will be found a certain  per cent of students who translate readily but who have only a  hazy notion as to the practical application of some of the most  fundamental principles of the grammar.    It is hoped that this book will help to fill the two needs above  referred to. The anecdotes have been selected from a large number  used by the author in conversational classes and drawn from a great  variety of sources, many of which will be readily recognized.  He is in a number of cases indebted to Claude Auge's excellent  grammar. Most of the anecdotes have been adapted to the author's  purpose of illustrating grammatical principles. Questionnaires  have been inserted.    In the preparation of the _vocabulaire_, the Petit Larousse and  Hatzfeld-Darmesteter dictionaries have been freely consulted.  Students will at first require some aid and encouragement from  the teacher, in the use of the all-French vocabulary; but they  can be made, in a surprisingly short time, to form the habit of  using a French dictionary by preference, and of doing a large  part of their thinking in French.    It is suggested that the book be used on certain days of the  week only, to supplement the student's reading texts, and provide  the sort of exercise indicated by its title. It is not intended  as a reader.    The author's thanks are due to his former colleague, Professor  Hugo P. Thieme, of the University of Michigan, for many helpful  suggestions and criticisms, as well as to Professor Rene Talamon,  of the same institution, who kindly assisted in reading the proof.

Il n'en est pas  tout a fait de meme de son ami Piron; toutefois suffira-t-il  de dire qu'il a ete l'auteur d'un grand nombre de satires et de  chansons spirituelles, quoique licencieuses.    Une fois Voltaire et Piron etaient alles passer quelque temps dans  un chateau. Un jour Piron ecrivit sur la porte de Voltaire le mot  Coquin. Sitot que Voltaire le vit, il se rendit chez Piron, qui lui  dit: \"Quel hasard me procure l'avantage de vous voir?--Monsieur,  lui repondit Voltaire, j'ai vu votre nom sur ma porte, et je  m'empresse de vous rendre ma visite.\"      A quel titre le nom de Voltaire est-it celebre?--Le nom de Piron  est-il aussi connu que celui du philosophe?--Dans quel genre  a-t-il montre du merite?--Ou sejournaient les deux auteurs?--Quel  tour Piron a-t-il joue a Voltaire?--Qu'est-ce que celui-ci a  fait sur-le-champ?    Faites ce recit de memoire.      3. LE DOMINO JAUNE    Sous Louis XVI, a l'occasion de la naissance du dauphin, une  grande fete fut donnee a Versailles, et l'histoire anecdotique  du regne a attache un plaisant souvenir au bal qui la termina.  Un buffet, orne superbement, offrait aux danseurs une collation  appretee avec une royale magnificence. Les regards des spectateurs  furent bientot attires sur une personne de haute taille, couverte  d'un domino jaune, que trois ou quatre fois deja on avait vue  s'approcher du buffet. Douee d'un appetit de Gargantua, et brulee  sans doute d'une soif inextinguible, elle mangeait et buvait  d'une facon prodigieuse.    La surprise se trouva changee en stupefaction, lorsqu'on apercut  le domino jaune attable pour la cinquieme fois, et que les mets  eurent recommence a disparaitre dans son estomac insatiable. On  se demandait: \"Quel est donc ce masque a l'appetit si prodigieux?\"  Et les vieux courtisans se disaient entre eux: \"Les plus grands  mangeurs que nous ayons[1] entendu vanter n'approchaient pas  de celui-ci.\" Informations prises, il se trouva que les gardes  francaises preposees a la garde du chateau avaient imagine la  plaisanterie suivante: le deguisement etait revetu a tour de  role par chacun de ces espiegles soldats, et ils participaient  ainsi aux joies de la fete. Instruite de cette mascarade amusante,  la reine en rit beaucoup. Les officiers furent pries de fermer  les yeux sur cette escapade, et les ordonnateurs du bal invites a  veiller au renouvellement ininterrompu des provisions du buffet.

At Last!    _________________________________________________________________    HERE was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really  splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was  spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears  were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged  in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his  paws, the effect was charming.    There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy  engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit  was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him,  and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great  rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the  excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was  forgotten.                              Christmas Morning    For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor,  and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and  being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite  snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down  upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended  they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and  lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an  opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit  could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that  real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust  like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and  should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed  wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have  had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with  Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel  himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who  was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.    The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.  He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the  seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled  out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long  succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and  by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they  were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery  magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that  are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all  about it.    \"What is REAL?\" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by  side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. \"Does  it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?\"    \"Real isn't how you are made,\" said the Skin Horse. \"It's a thing that  happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just  to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.\"    \"Does it hurt?\" asked the Rabbit.    \"Sometimes,\" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. \"When  you are Real you don't mind being hurt.\"    \"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,\" he asked, \"or bit  by bit?\"    \"It doesn't happen all at once,\" said the Skin Horse. \"You become. It  takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who  break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.  Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved  off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very  shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are  Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\"    \"I suppose you are real?\" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had  not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the  Skin Horse only smiled.                        The Skin Horse Tells His Story    \"The Boy's Uncle made me Real,\" he said. \"That was a great many years  ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for  always.\"    The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this  magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know  what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his  eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it  without these uncomfortable things happening to him.    There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she  took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no  reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled  them away in cupboards. She called this \"tidying up,\" and the  playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn't  mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft.    One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china  dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too  much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked  about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made  a swoop.    \"Here,\" she said, \"take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!\"  And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's  arms.    That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in  the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy  hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and  sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could  scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in  the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the  Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk  to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he  said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had  splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her  supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when  the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close  under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped  close round him all night long.    And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy  that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting  shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink  rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him.    Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the  Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and  picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the  raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was  called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the  lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with  the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there.  He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the  burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled  as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron.                                 Spring Time    \"You must have your old Bunny!\" she said. \"Fancy all that fuss for a  toy!\"    The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.    \"Give me my Bunny!\" he said. \"You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy.  He's REAL!\"    When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what  the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had  happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy  himself had said it.    That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred  in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his  boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a  look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning  when she picked him up, and said, \"I declare if that old Bunny hasn't  got quite a knowing expression!\"      That was a wonderful Summer!    Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June  evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the  Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers,  or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a  little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy,  for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be  comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone,  watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the  grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near  him.    They were rabbits like himself, but quite"]]]
