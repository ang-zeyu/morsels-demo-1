Our sketchy tour of Windsor Castle has hitherto been told in visits far  between, perhaps, if not few, for the interesting character of the whole  fabric.[1]    The present Cut includes the North-east view, a picturesque if not  important point. The reader will remember, if he has not enjoyed, the  splendid terrace on the north; this is now continued on the eastern side.  The fine tower at the eastern end of the north terrace, (at the angle,) is  _Brunswick Tower_, with a projecting bastion in its front containing the  apparatus for heating the orangery, with rooms for the attendants; it is  octagon shaped, and has a most commanding appearance, the height being 120  feet above the level of the terrace.    A staircase turret communicates with the apartments, the principal one  being appropriated as a private dining-room by the late King, while the  larger apartments on the east front were reserved for splendid  entertainments. In a central position between the state dining-room and  St. George's Hall is a music saloon, in which is placed a fine-toned organ.  A communication has been effected between Brunswick Tower and the state  apartments by a corridor terminating at the King's Guard Chamber, where a  new tower, named after George the Third, has been erected: the principal  window is extremely large, and divided by Gothic tracery into several  compartments, producing a noble and cathedral-like appearance.    Beneath the Castle, in the Engraving, are seen the wooded slopes of the  Little Park, the \"green retreats\" of Pope, where      ----Waving groves a checker'd scene display    And part admit, and part exclude the day.    *** The friendly suggestion of our Correspondent, G.C. (Windsor Castle)  shall be considered.

It is generally supposed that the extensive search after, and diffusion of,  knowledge, is in a great measure peculiar to these present times. It seems  therefore to me a very curious thing to find a learned man and an  accomplished courtier protesting against book-learning as an evil, so far  back as the year 1646, and a curious thing he himself appears to have  thought it, introducing his opinion as a \"paradox\" until he explains. In  this explanation we find the same opinion that is now strenuously insisted  on by Mr. Cobbett, namely, that a man who properly understands his own  business or employment, though he have nothing of literature, is by no  means to be accounted ignorant.    The letters of James Howell, Esq. are well known as fluent examples of the  best style of writing of his day, and as repositories of many curious  facts and intelligent remarks. The following letter appears to be  addressed to Lord Dorchester--    \"My Lord,--The subject of this letter may, peradventure, seem a paradox to  some, but not, I know, to your Lordship, when you are pleased to weigh  well the reasons. Learning is a thing that hath been much cried up, and  coveted in all ages, especially in this last century of years, by people  of all sorts, though never so mean and mechanical; every man strains his  fortune to keep his children at school; the cobbler will clout it till  midnight, the porter will carry burdens till his bones crack again, the  ploughman will pinch both back and belly to give his son _learning_, and I  find that this ambition reigns no where so much as in this island. But,  under favour, this word, _learning_, is taken in a narrower sense among us  than among other nations: we seem to restrain it only to the _book_,  whereas, indeed, any artisan whatsoever (if he knew the secret and mystery  of his trade) may be called a learned man: a good mason; a good shoemaker,  that can manage St. Crispin's lance handsomely; a skilful yeoman; a good  ship-wright, &c. may be all called learned men, and indeed the usefullest  sort of learned men.    \"The extravagant humour of our country is not to be altogether  commended--that all men should aspire to book-learning; there is not a  simpler animal, and a more superfluous member of a state than a mere  scholar, a self-pleasing student. Archimedes, though an excellent  engineer, when Syracuse was lost, was found in his study, intoxicated with  speculations; and another great, learned philosopher, like a fool or  frantic, when being in a bath, he leaped out naked among the people, and  cried, 'I have found it, I have found it,' having hit then upon an  extraordinary conclusion in geometry. There is a famous tale of Thomas  Aquinas, the angelical doctor, and of Bonadventure, the seraphical doctor,  of whom Alexander Hales, our countryman, reports, that these great clerks  were invited to dinner by the French King, on purpose to observe their  humours, and being brought to the room where the table was laid, the first  fell to eating of bread as hard as he could drive, at last, breaking out  of a brown study, he cried out '_Conclusum est contra Manichaeos;_' the  other fell a gazing upon the Queen, and the King asking him how he liked  her, he answered, 'Oh, sir, if an earthly Queen be so beautiful, what  shall we think of the Queen of Heaven?' The latter was the better courtier  of the two.    \"My Lord, I know none in this age more capable to sit in the chair, and  censure what is true learning, and what _not_, than yourself; therefore,  in speaking of this subject to your Lordship, I fear to have committed the  same error as Phormio did, in discoursing of war before Hannibal.    \"My Lord, your most humble, &c.    \"JAMES HOWELL.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ILLUMINATED PSALTER.    (_For the Mirror_.)    There is an illuminated Psalter preserved amongst the MSS. in the British  Museum, 2. A. 16., written by John Mallard, Chaplain to Henry VIII.,  wherein are several notes in that king's hand writing, some in pencil  prefixed to Psalm liii. (\"_Dixit incipiens_.\") According to a very ancient  custom are the figures of King David and a fool, in this instance  evidently the portraits of Henry and his jester, Will Somers.    S.

The earliest poetical Valentines remaining, are those preserved in the  works of Charles Duke of Orleans, father to Louis XII. of France. He was  taken prisoner at the battle of Agincourt, and remained in England  twenty-five years, and called his mistress his _Valentine_. In the royal  library of MSS. now in the British Museum, there is a magnificent volume  containing his writings whilst in England; it belonged to Henry VIII. for  whom it was copied from older MSS. It is illuminated: one painting  represents the duke in the White Tower, at a writing table. This MSS. also  contain some of the compositions of Eloisa.

The fore-foot of a _Hare_ worn constantly in the pocket, is esteemed by  certain worthy old dames as a sure preventive of rheumatic disorders.    The _Lynx_ was believed by the ancients, from the acuteness of its sight,  to have the power of seeing through stone walls; and amongst other  absurdities then gravely maintained were these: that the _Elephant_ had no  joints, and being unable to lie down, was obliged to sleep leaning against  a tree; that _Deer_ lived several hundred years; that the _Badger_ had the  legs of one side shorter than those of the other; that the _Chameleon_  lived entirely on air, and the _Salamander_ in fire; whilst the sphynx,  satyr, unicorn, centaur, hypogriff, hydra, dragon, griffin, cockatrice, &c.  &c. &c. were either the creations of fancy, or fabled accounts of  creatures of whose real form, origin, nature, and qualities, but the most  imperfect knowledge was afloat.    The flesh of the _Rhinoceros_, and almost every part of its body, is  reckoned by the ignorant natives of countries where it is found, an  antidote against poison.    That the _Jackal_ is the \"Lion's Provider,\" entirely, is an erroneous idea;  but it is true that the terrific cry of this animal when in chase, rouses  the lion, whose ear is dull, and enables him to join in the pursuit of  prey. Many stories are told respecting the generosity of the _Lion_, and  it was once confidently believed that no stress of hunger would induce him  to devour a virgin, though his imperial appetite might satiate itself on  men and matrons. The title of King of the Beasts, given at a period when  strength and ferocity were deemed the prime qualities of man--is now more  justly considered to belong to the mild, majestic, and almost rational  elephant. The _White Elephant_ is a sacred animal with the Siamese, and  the cow with the Bramins and Hindoos.    The _Bear_ was believed never to devour a man whom it found dead; and it  was imagined to lick its cubs into proper shape: hence the expression  \"unlicked cub,\" applied to a raw, awkward, unpolished youth. The saliva of  the _Lama_, which when angry it ejects, has been erroneously supposed to  possess a corrosive quality.    The hoof of the _Moose-deer_ was formerly in great repute for curing  epilepsies, but has now justly fallen into neglect.

[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: STAINES NEW BRIDGE.]      This handsome structure has lately been completed, and was opened on  Easter Monday last, April 24, by their Majesties and the Court passing  over with suitable ceremony. This was a gala day for Staines and its  vicinity; for, independently of the enthusiasm awakened by the visit  of the popular Sovereign, the completion of so useful and ornamental  a fabric must have been an occasion of no ordinary interest to every  inhabitant of the district.    The _programme_, as the French would say, of the day's _fete_ has been  so recently given in the \"chronicles of the times,\" that we need not  repeat it. A few descriptive particulars of the Bridge, from _The  Times_ Journal, may be found to possess a more permanent value:--        \"It consists of three very flat segmental arches of granite. The      middle arch of 74 feet span, and the two side arches of 66 feet      each; besides two side arches of 10 feet each for the      towing-paths, and six brick arches of 20 feet span each, two on      the Surrey side, and four on the Middlesex side, to allow the      floods to pass off. The whole is surmounted by a plain, bold      cornice, and block parapet of granite, with pedestal for the      lamps, and a neat toll-house. The approaches to the Bridge on      either side form gentle curves of easy ascent. The cost of the      Bridge and approaches has been about 41,000l. The appearance of      the whole is very light and elegant. This is owing chiefly to      the slight dimensions of the piers, which are smaller in      proportion to the span of the arches they support than those of      any other bridge in England; but this slight appearance does      not, we understand, detract in any degree from their strength,      or from the durability of the superincumbent structure.\"    From the same authority we gather this circumstantial account of the  Bridges erected at Staines from the year 1262:        \"The first erection mentioned in the archives of Staines, was a      wooden bridge, said to have been erected in the year 1262; it      was constructed of piles of oak driven into the bed of the river      and covered with planks. We hear of no new erection from that      period down to the year 1794; but from that year to the present,      there have been not less than four new bridges in succession,      and on nearly the same site. In the year 1794 and 1795, a new      bridge, of three semicircular arches of stone, from the design      of the celebrated Paul Sandby, was erected, but, from some      defect in its construction, it lasted only five years, when it      was replaced by a very elegant bridge of one arch, of 180 feet      span, of cast iron, from the design of Mr. Thomas Wilson, the      architect of the celebrated bridge over the river Weir, at      Sunderland. The design was attributed to the noted author of the      _Rights of Man_; but the arch designed by him was cast in the      year 1790, by Messrs. Walkers, at Rotherham, whence it was      brought to London, and erected at the bowling-green of the      Yorkshire Stingo public-house, where it was exhibited to the      public; Paine not being able to defray the expense, the arch was      taken down and carried back to Rotherham; part of it was      afterwards used in the Sunderland bridge, and part, it is      supposed, in the Staines bridge. This last, like its immediate      predecessor, was not destined to last long, for it had scarcely      been opened one month, when it was found necessary to close it      to the public, the arch having sunk in a very alarming degree.      His late Majesty King George the Third was said to have been      among the last to pass over it. In this emergency the late Mr.      Rennie was consulted, who pronounced the bridge altogether      dangerous, in consequence of the weakness of the abutments. No      alternative remained but to remove the iron bridge entirely, and      patch up the old wooden bridge until a new one of wood was      built. That bridge, which is the present old bridge, continued      to stand, with various repairs and alterations, until the year      1828, when, in consequence of the decay of the piles, and the      continual heavy expenses required to uphold it, the      Commissioners determined to build a new one of more durable      materials. Messrs. Rennie were therefore applied to for designs,      and a bill was brought into Parliament to authorize the      Commissioners to raise funds. The works were commenced in the      spring of 1829, and on the 14th of September following the first      stone was laid by their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of      Clarence (their present Majesties). Since then, the works have      been carried on to their present completion under the direction      of Mr. G. Rennie and Mr. Brown, the superintendents, and Messrs.      Jolliffe and Banks, the contractors.\"    The Engraving is from a Sketch by our obliging Windsor Correspondent:  it was taken from the old bridge, whence the spectator enjoys a  delightful view of Windsor Castle, through the centre arch of the new  fabric.    By the way, we noticed the project of this new stone bridge, in  connexion with our Engraving of the new church at Staines, in vol.  xii. of _The Mirror_, August 30, 1828.           *       *       *       *       *      THE WRECK.      _(FOR THE MIRROR.)_        No mare, no more, o'er the dark blue sea,      Will the gallant vessel bound,    Fearless and proud as the warrior's plume      At the trumpet's startling sound;    No more will her banner assert its claim      To empire on the foam,    And the sailors cheer as the thunder rolls      From the guns of their wave-girt home!      Her white sails gleam'd like the sunny dawn      On the brow of the sapphire sky,    And her thunder echoed along the cliffs,      Awaking the seamew's cry;    Oh! it was glorious to see her glide      Triumphantly over the sea,    With her blue flag fluttering in the wind,      The symbol of victory.      But she lies forlorn in the breakers now,      Her stately masts are gone,    And cold are the hearts of the dauntless crew      That yielded their swords to none;    The gun is hush'd in her lofty sides,      And the flute on her silent deck;    Alas! that a queenly form like hers      Should ever have been a wreck!      Thus Hope's illusions droop away      From the heart which their beauty won,    And leave it forlorn as the gallant ship,      Ere its summer of life is begun.    It is peopled with lovely images,      As o'er the sea it glides,    But wreck'd is its deep idolatry      On the dark and stormy tides.      _Deal._           G.R.C.           *       *       *       *       *      THE ARBALEST OF ROBIN HOOD.      _(TO THE EDITOR.)_      In No. 538, of _The Mirror_, is described an elegant Cross-bow, and  a desire expressed for information where such things are _now_ to be  seen. I have lived many years in Yorkshire, and have seen several  kinds of these bows at _Kirklees Hall_, the seat of Sir George  Armitage, a few miles from Huddersfield. Amongst those bows I saw one,  at least six feet long; but some of them were not more than two or  three feet in length. There were also a variety of weapons of war,  with helmets, and some curious boots, which buttoned on the leg from  top to the bottom, and had wooden soles. They were then kept in an  attic on the top of the leads over the hall. Many of these relics are  said to have belonged to the famous \"Robin Hood,\" who lies buried  in the park; the remains of the ancient grave-stone having been  surrounded with a handsome iron railing, by the late Sir George  Armitage; in the wall is an old inscription on brass; it is situated  in a very gloomy place. Not far distant from his grave are the remains  of a Nunnery, and a burial-ground, with tombs in it; but I could find  no date, either in the house or on these tombs. One of the tombs has  this inscription round its edge:        \"Sweet Jesus of Nazareth, show mercy to Elizabeth Stainton, late      Prioress of this place.\"    If an intelligent person were to call at the Hall, he would be able  to gather much information of an authentic nature respecting Robin  Hood.[1]        [1] We hope this note may meet the eye of some of our Yorkshire      correspondents.
