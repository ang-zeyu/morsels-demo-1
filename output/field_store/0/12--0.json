It is the country of perpetual sacrifice, the country that saw Abraham  build the altar upon which he was ready to immolate his only son, the  country that Moses saw from a distance, stretching in beauty and  loveliness,--a land of promise never to be attained,--the country that  gave the world its symbols of soul and spirit. Palestine!    No war correspondents, no Red Cross or relief committees have gone to  Palestine, because no actual fighting has taken place there, and yet  hundreds of thousands are suffering there that worst of agonies, the  agony of the spirit.    Those who have devoted their lives to show the world that Palestine can  be made again a country flowing with milk and honey, those who have  dreamed of reviving the spirit of the prophets and the great teachers,  are hanged and persecuted and exiled, their dreams shattered, their holy  places profaned, their work ruined. Cut off from the world, with no  bread to sustain the starving body, the heavy boot of a barbarian  soldiery trampling their very soul, the dreamers of Palestine refuse to  surrender, and amidst the clash of guns and swords they are battling for  the spirit with the weapons of the spirit.    The time has not yet come to write the record of these battles, nor even  to attempt to render justice to the sublime heroes of Palestine. This  book is merely the story of some of the personal experiences of one who  has done less and suffered less than thousands of his comrades.    ALEXANDER AARONSOHN          WITH THE TURKS IN PALESTINE.          CHAPTER I    ZICRON-JACOB      Thirty-five years ago, the impulse which has since been organized as the  Zionist Movement led my parents to leave their homes in Roumania and  emigrate to Palestine, where they joined a number of other Jewish  pioneers in founding Zicron-Jacob--a little village lying just south of  Mount Carmel, in that fertile coastal region close to the ancient Plains  of Armageddon.    Here I was born; my childhood was passed here in the peace and harmony  of this little agricultural community, with its whitewashed stone houses  huddled close together for protection against the native Arabs who, at  first, menaced the life of the new colony. The village was far more  suggestive of Switzerland than of the conventional slovenly villages of  the East, mud-built and filthy; for while it was the purpose of our  people, in returning to the Holy Land, to foster the Jewish language and  the social conditions of the Old Testament as far as possible, there  was nothing retrograde in this movement. No time was lost in introducing  progressive methods of agriculture, and the climatological experiments  of other countries were observed and made use of in developing the ample  natural resources of the land.    [ILLUSTRATION: THE CEMETERY OF ZICRON-JACOB]    Eucalyptus, imported from Australia, soon gave the shade of its cool,  healthful foliage where previously no trees had grown. In the course of  time dry farming (which some people consider a recent discovery, but  which in reality is as old as the Old Testament) was introduced and  extended with American agricultural implements; blooded cattle were  imported, and poultry-raising on a large scale was undertaken with the  aid of incubators--to the disgust of the Arabs, who look on such  usurpation of the hen's functions as against nature and sinful. Our  people replaced the wretched native trails with good roads, bordered by  hedges of thorny acacia which, in season, were covered with downy little  yellow blossoms that smelled sweeter than honey when the sun was on  them.    More important than all these, a communistic village government was  established, in which both sexes enjoyed equal rights, including that of  suffrage--strange as this may seem to persons who (when they think of  the matter at all) form vague conceptions of all the women-folk of  Palestine as shut up in harems.    A short experience with Turkish courts and Turkish justice taught our  people that they would have to establish a legal system of their own;  two collaborating judges were therefore appointed--one to interpret the  Mosaic law, another to temper it with modern jurisprudence. All Jewish  disputes were settled by this court. Its effectiveness may be judged by  the fact that the Arabs, weary of Turkish venality,--as open and  shameless as anywhere in the world,--began in increasing numbers to  bring their difficulties to our tribunal. Jews are law-abiding people,  and life in those Palestine colonies tended to bring out the fraternal  qualities of our race; but it is interesting to note that in over thirty  years not one Jewish criminal case was reported from forty-five  villages.    Zicron-Jacob was a little town of one hundred and thirty \"fires\"--so we  call it--when, in 1910, on the advice of my elder brother, who was head  of the Jewish Experiment Station at Athlit, an ancient town of the  Crusaders, I left for America to enter the service of the United States  in the Department of Agriculture. A few days after reaching this country  I took out my first naturalization papers and proceeded to Washington,  where I became part of that great government service whose beneficent  activity is too little known by Americans. Here I remained until June,  1913, when I returned to Palestine with the object of taking  motion-pictures and stereopticon views. These I intended to use in a  lecturing tour for spreading the Zionist propaganda in the United  States.    During the years of my residence in America, I was able to appreciate  and judge in their right value the beauty and inspiration of the life  which my people led in the Holy Land. From a distance, too, I saw better  the need for organization among our communities, and I determined to  build up a fraternal union of the young Jewish men all over the country.    Two months after my return from America, an event occurred which gave  impetus to these projects. The physician of our village, an old man who  had devoted his entire life to serving and healing the people of  Palestine, without distinction of race or religion, was driving home one  evening in his carriage from a neighboring settlement. With him was a  young girl of sixteen. In a deserted place they were set upon by four  armed Arabs, who beat the old man to unconsciousness as he tried, in  vain, to defend the girl from the terrible fate which awaited her.    Night came on. Alarmed by the absence of the physician, we young men  rode out in search of him. We finally discovered what had happened; and  then and there, in the serene moonlight of that Eastern night, with  tragedy close at hand, I made my comrades take oath on the honor of  their sisters to organize themselves into a strong society for the  defense of the life and honor of our villagers and of our people at  large.    These details are, perhaps, useful for the better understanding of the  disturbances that came thick and fast when in August, 1914, the  war-madness broke out among the nations of Europe. The repercussion was  at once felt even in our remote corner of the earth. Soon after the  German invasion of Belgium the Turkish army was mobilized and all  citizens of the Empire between nineteen and forty-five years were called  to the colors. As the Young Turk Constitution of 1909 provided that all  Christians and Jews were equally liable to military service, our young  men knew that they, too, would be called upon to make the common  sacrifice.

Light This method assures a low rate  of errors in the text--often lower than in the original. Special thanks  go to Gary M. Johnson, of Takoma Park, Maryland, for his assistance in  procuring a copy of the original text, and to the readers of  soc.culture.australian and rec.arts.books (USENET newsgroups) for their  help in preparing the glossary. Italicized words or phrases are  capitalized. Some obvious errors may have been corrected.      *****      An incomplete glossary of Australian, British, or antique terms and  concepts which may prove helpful to understanding this book:      \"A house where they took in cards on a tray\" (from Joe Wilson's  Courtship): An upper class house, with servants who would take a  visitor's card (on a tray) to announce their presence, or, if the family  was out, to keep a record of the visit.    Anniversary Day: Mentioned in the text, is now known as Australia Day.  It commemorates the establishment of the first English settlement in  Australia, at Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), on 26 January 1788.    Gin: An obvious abbreviation of \"aborigine\", it only refers to *female*  aborigines, and is now considered derogatory. It was not considered  derogatory at the time Lawson wrote.    Jackaroo: At the time Lawson wrote, a Jackaroo was a \"new chum\" or  newcomer to Australia, who sought work on a station to gain experience.  The term now applies to any young man working as a station hand. A  female station hand is a Jillaroo. Variant: Jackeroo.    Old-fashioned child: A child that acts old for their age. Americans  would say 'Precocious'.    'Possum: In Australia, a class of marsupials that were originally  mistaken for possums. They are not especially related to the possums of  North and South America, other than both being marsupials.    Public/Pub.: The traditional pub. in Australia was a hotel with a  \"public\" bar--hence the name. The modern pub has often (not always)  dispensed with the lodging, and concentrated on the bar.    Tea: In addition to the regular meaning, Tea can also mean a light snack  or a meal (i.e., where Tea is served). In particular, Morning Tea (about  10 AM) and Afternoon Tea (about 3 PM) are nothing more than a snack, but  Evening Tea (about 6 PM) is a meal. When just \"Tea\" is used, it usually  means the evening meal. Variant: Tea-time.    Tucker: Food.    Shout: In addition to the regular meaning, it also refers to buying  drinks for all the members of a group, etc. The use of this term can be  confusing, so the first instance is footnoted in the text.    Sly-grog-shop: An unlicensed bar or liquor-store.    Station: A farm or ranch, especially one devoted to cattle or sheep.    Store Bullock: Lawson makes several references to these. A bullock is  a castrated bull. Bullocks were used in Australia for work that was  too heavy for horses. 'Store' may refer to those cattle, and their  descendants, brought to Australia by the British government, and sold to  settlers from the 'Store'--hence, the standard draft animal.    Also: a hint with the seasons--remember that the seasons are reversed  from those in the northern hemisphere, hence June may be hot, but  December is even hotter. Australia is at a lower latitude than the  United States, so the winters are not harsh by US standards, and are not  even mild in the north. In fact, large parts of Australia are governed  more by \"dry\" versus \"wet\" than by Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter.    --A. L.

Some carry their swags in the Great North-West       Where the bravest battle and die,      And a few have gone to their last long rest,       And a few have said \"Good-bye!\"      The coast grows dim, and it may be long       Ere the Gums again I see;      So I put my soul in a farewell song       To the chaps who barracked for me.        Their days are hard at the best of times,       And their dreams are dreams of care--      God bless them all for their big soft hearts,       And the brave, brave grins they wear!

And not for gold nor the world's applause--       Though ways to the end they be--      I'll win, if a man might win, because       Of the men who believed in me.            Contents.

When he  is put into knickerbockers, for instance, and 'comes a man to-day,' as  my little Jim used to say. When they're cooking something at home that  he likes. When the 'sandy-blight' or measles breaks out amongst the  children, or the teacher or his wife falls dangerously ill--or dies, it  doesn't matter which--'and there ain't no school.' When a boy is naked  and in his natural state for a warm climate like Australia, with three  or four of his schoolmates, under the shade of the creek-oaks in the  bend where there's a good clear pool with a sandy bottom. When his  father buys him a gun, and he starts out after kangaroos or 'possums.  When he gets a horse, saddle, and bridle, of his own. When he has his  arm in splints or a stitch in his head--he's proud then, the proudest  boy in the district.    I wasn't a healthy-minded, average boy: I reckon I was born for a poet  by mistake, and grew up to be a Bushman, and didn't know what was the  matter with me--or the world--but that's got nothing to do with it.    There are times when a man is happy. When he finds out that the girl  loves him. When he's just married. When he's a lawful father for the  first time, and everything is going on all right: some men make fools  of themselves then--I know I did. I'm happy to-night because I'm out of  debt and can see clear ahead, and because I haven't been easy for a long  time.    But I think that the happiest time in a man's life is when he's courting  a girl and finds out for sure that she loves him and hasn't a thought  for any one else. Make the most of your courting days, you young chaps,  and keep them clean, for they're about the only days when there's a  chance of poetry and beauty coming into this life. Make the best of them  and you'll never regret it the longest day you live. They're the days  that the wife will look back to, anyway, in the brightest of times as  well as in the blackest, and there shouldn't be anything in those days  that might hurt her when she looks back. Make the most of your courting  days, you young chaps, for they will never come again.    A married man knows all about it--after a while: he sees the woman world  through the eyes of his wife; he knows what an extra moment's pressure  of the hand means, and, if he has had a hard life, and is inclined to be  cynical, the knowledge does him no good. It leads him into awful messes  sometimes, for a married man, if he's inclined that way, has three times  the chance with a woman that a single man has--because the married man  knows. He is privileged; he can guess pretty closely what a woman means  when she says something else; he knows just how far he can go; he can go  farther in five minutes towards coming to the point with a woman than an  innocent young man dares go in three weeks. Above all, the married man  is more decided with women; he takes them and things for granted. In  short he is--well, he is a married man. And, when he knows all this, how  much better or happier is he for it? Mark Twain says that he lost all  the beauty of the river when he saw it with a pilot's eye,--and there  you have it.    But it's all new to a young chap, provided he hasn't been a young  blackguard. It's all wonderful, new, and strange to him. He's a  different man. He finds that he never knew anything about women. He sees  none of woman's little ways and tricks in his girl. He is in heaven one  day and down near the other place the next; and that's the sort of thing  that makes life interesting. He takes his new world for granted. And,  when she says she'll be his wife----!    Make the most of your courting days, you young chaps, for they've got a  lot of influence on your married life afterwards--a lot more than you'd  think. Make the best of them, for they'll never come any more, unless  we do our courting over again in another world. If we do, I'll make the  most of"]]]
