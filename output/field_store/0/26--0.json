Critical Notice    OF BOIARDO'S LIFE AND GENIUS.[1]    While Pulci in Florence was elevating romance out of the street-ballads,  and laying the foundation of the chivalrous epic, a poet appeared in  Lombardy (whether inspired by his example is uncertain) who was destined  to carry it to a graver though still cheerful height, and prepare the way  for the crowning glories of Ariosto. In some respects he even excelled  Ariosto: in all, with the exception of style, shewed himself a genuine  though immature master.    Little is known of his life, but that little is very pleasant. It  exhibits him in the rare light of a poet who was at once rich, romantic,  an Arcadian and a man of the world, a feudal lord and an indulgent  philosopher, a courtier equally beloved by prince and people.    Matteo Maria Boiardo, Count of Scandiano, Lord of Arceto, Casalgrande,  &c., Governor of Reggio, and Captain of the citadel of Modena (it is  pleasant to repeat such titles when so adorned), is understood to have  been born about the year 1434, at Scandiano, a castle at the foot of the  Apennines, not far from Reggio, and famous for its vines.    He was of an ancient family, once lords of Rubiera, and son of Giovanni,  second count of Scandiano, and Lucia, a lady of a branch of the Strozzi  family in Florence, and sister and aunt of Tito and Erole Strozzi,  celebrated Latin poets. His parents appear to have been wise people, for  they gave him an education that fitted him equally for public and private  life. He was even taught, or acquired, more Greek than was common to the  men of letters of that age. His whole life seems, accordingly, to have  been divided, with equal success, between his duties as a servant of the  dukes of Modena, both military and civil, and the prosecution of his  beloved art of poetry,--a combination of pursuits which have been idly  supposed incompatible. Milton's poetry did not hinder him from being  secretary to Cromwell, and an active partisan. Even the sequestered  Spenser was a statesman; and poets and writers of fiction abound in  the political histories of all the great nations of Europe. When a  man possesses a thorough insight into any one intellectual department  (except, perhaps, in certain corners of science), it only sharpens his  powers of perception for the others, if he chooses to apply them.    In the year 1469, Boiardo was one of the noblemen who went to meet the  Emperor Frederick the Third on his way to Ferrara, when Duke Borso of  Modena entertained him in that city. Two years afterwards, Borso, who had  been only Marquis of Ferrara, received its ducal title from the Pope; and  on going to Rome to be invested with his new honours, the name of our  poet is again found among the adorners of his state. A few days after his  return home this prince died; and Boiardo, favoured as he had been by  him, appears to have succeeded to a double portion of regard in the  friendship of the new duke, Ercole, who was more of his own age.    During all this period, from his youth to his prime, our author varied  his occupations with Italian and Latin poetry; some of it addressed to a  lady of the name of Antonia Caprara, and some to another, whose name is  thought to have been Rosa; but whether these ladies died, or his love was  diverted elsewhere, he took to wife, in the year 1472, Taddea Gonzaga, of  the noble house of that name, daughter of the Count of Novellara. In the  course of the same year he is supposed to have begun his great poem. A  popular court-favourite, in the prime of life, marrying and commencing  a great poem nearly at one and the same time, presents an image of  prosperity singularly delightful. By this lady Boiardo had two sons and  four daughters. The younger son, Francesco Maria, died in his childhood;  but the elder, Camillo, succeeded to his father's title, and left an heir  to it,--the last, I believe, of the name. The reception given to the  poet's bride, when he took her to Scandiano, is said to have been very  splendid.    In the ensuing year the duke his master took a wife himself. She was  Eleonora, daughter of the King of Naples; and the newly-married poet was  among the noblemen who were sent to escort her to Ferrara. For several  years afterwards, his time was probably filled up with the composition  of the _Orlando Innamorato_, and the entertainments given by a splendid  court. He was appointed Governor of Reggio, probably in 1478. At the  expiration of two or three years he was made Captain of the citadel of  Modena; and in 1482 a war broke out, with the Venetians, in which he took  part, for it interrupted the progress of his poem. In 1484 he returned  to it; but ten years afterwards was again and finally interrupted by the  unprincipled descent of the French on Italy under Charles the Eighth; and  in the December following he died. The _Orlando Innamorato_ was thus left  unfinished. Eight years before his decease the author published what he  had written of it up to that time, but the first complete edition was  posthumous. The poet was writing when the French came: he breaks off with  an anxious and bitter notice of the interruption, though still unable to  deny himself a last word on the episode which he was relating, and a hope  that he should conclude it another time.      \"Mentre che io canto, o Dio redentore,      Vedo l'Italia tutta a fiamma e foco,    Per questi Galli, che con gran valore      Vengon, per disertar non so che loco:    Pero vi lascio in questo vano amore      Di Fiordespina ardente poco a poco    Un' altra volta, se mi fia concesso,    Racconterovvi il tutto per espresso.\"      But while I sing, mine eyes, great God! behold      A flaming fire light all the Italian sky,    Brought by these French, who, with their myriads bold,      Come to lay waste, I know not where or why.    Therefore, at present, I must leave untold      How love misled poor Fiordespina's eye.[2]    Another time, Fate willing, I shall tell,    From first to last, how every thing befell.    Besides the _Orlando Innamorato_, Boiardo wrote a variety of prose works,  a comedy in verse on the subject of Timon, lyrics of great elegance, with  a vein of natural feeling running through them, and Latin poetry of a  like sort, not, indeed, as classical in its style as that of Politian and  the other subsequent revivers of the ancient manner, but perhaps not  the less interesting on that account; for it is difficult to conceive  a thorough copyist in style expressing his own thorough feelings. Mr.  Panizzi, if I am not mistaken, promised the world a collection of the  miscellaneous poems of Boiardo; but we have not yet had the pleasure  of seeing them. In his life of the poet, however, he has given several  specimens, both Latin and Italian, which are extremely agreeable. The  Latin poems consist of ten eclogues and a few epigrams; but the epigrams,  this critic tells us, are neither good nor on a fitting subject, being  satirical sallies against Nicolo of Este, who had attempted to seize on  Ferrara, and been beheaded. Boiardo was not of a nature qualified to  indulge in bitterness. A man of his chivalrous disposition probably  misgave himself while he was writing these epigrams. Perhaps he suffered  them to escape his pen out of friendship for the reigning branch of the  family. But it must be confessed, that some of the best-natured men have  too often lost sight of their higher feelings during the pleasure and  pride of composition.    With respect to the comedy of _Timon_, if the whole of it is written as  well as the concluding address of the misanthrope (which Mr. Panizzi has  extracted into his pages), it must be very pleasant. Timon conceals a  treasure in a tomb, and thinks he has baffled some knaves who had a  design upon it. He therefore takes leave of his audience with the  following benedictions              \"Pur ho scacciate queste due formiche,    Che raspavano l' oro alla mia buca,    Or vadan pur, che Dio le malediche.         Cotal fortuna a casa li conduca,    Che lor fiacchi le gambe al primo passo,    E nel secondo l'osso della nuca.        Voi altri, che ascoltate giuso al basso,    Chiedete, se volete alcuna cosa,    Prima ch' io parta, perche mo vi lasso.        Benche abbia l'alma irata e disdegnosa,    Da ingiusti oltraggi combattuta e vinta,    A voi gia non l'avro tanto ritrosa.        In me non e pietade al tutto estinta    Faccia di voi la prova chi gli pare,    Sino alla corda, the mi trovo cinta;      Gli prestero, volendosi impiccare.\"         So!

This was Lucan, who has nowhere exhibited more brilliant rhetoric, nor  wandered more from the truth, than in the contrasted portraits of Caesar  and Pompey. The famous line, _\"Nil actum reputans si quid superesset  agendum,\"_ is a fine feature of the real character, finely expressed.  But, if it had been Lucan's purpose (as possibly, with a view to  Pompey's benefit, in some respects it was) utterly and extravagantly to  falsify the character of the great Dictator, by no single trait could he  more effectually have fulfilled that purpose, nor in fewer words, than  by this expressive passage, _\"Gaudensque viam fecisse ruina.\"_ Such a  trait would be almost extravagant applied even to Marius, who (though in  many respects a perfect model of Roman grandeur, massy, columnar,  imperturbable, and more perhaps than any one man recorded in History  capable of justifying the bold illustration of that character in Horace,  \"_Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidum ferient ruinae_\") had, however,  a ferocity in his character, and a touch of the devil in him, very  rarely united with the same tranquil intrepidity. But, for Caesar, the  all-accomplished statesman, the splendid orator, the man of elegant  habits and polished taste, the patron of the fine arts in a degree  transcending all example of his own or the previous age, and as a man of  general literature so much beyond his contemporaries, except Cicero,  that he looked down even upon the brilliant Sylla as an illiterate  person--to class such a man with the race of furious destroyers exulting  in the desolations they spread is to err not by an individual trait, but  by the whole genus. The Attilas and the Tamerlanes, who rejoice in  avowing themselves the scourges of God, and the special instruments of  his wrath, have no one feature of affinity to the polished and humane  Caesar, and would as little have comprehended his character as he could  have respected theirs. Even Cato, the unworthy hero of Lucan, might have  suggested to him a little more truth in this instance, by a celebrated  remark which he made on the characteristic distinction of Caesar, in  comparison with other revolutionary disturbers; for, said he, whereas  others had attempted the overthrow of the state in a continued paroxysm  of fury, and in a state of mind resembling the lunacy of intoxication,  Caesar, on the contrary, among that whole class of civil disturbers, was  the only one who had come to the task in a temper of sobriety and  moderation _(unum accessisse sobrium ad rempublicam delendam)_....    Great as Caesar was by the benefit of his original nature, there can be  no doubt that he, like others, owed something to circumstances; and  perhaps amongst those which were most favourable to the premature  development of great self-dependence we must reckon the early death of  his father. It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an  advantage to be orphaned at as early age. Perhaps utter orphanage is  rarely or never such: but to lose a father betimes may, under  appropriate circumstances, profit a strong mind greatly. To Caesar it  was a prodigious benefit that he lost his father when not much more than  fifteen. Perhaps it was an advantage also to his father that he died  thus early. Had he stayed a year longer, he might have seen himself  despised, baffled, and made ridiculous. For where, let us ask, in any  age, was the father capable of adequately sustaining that relation to  the unique Caius Julius--to him, in the appropriate language of  Shakespeare      \"The foremost man of all this world?\"    And, in this fine and Caesarean line, \"this world\" is to be understood  not of the order of co-existences merely,` but also of the order of  successions; he was the foremost man not only of his contemporaries, but  also, within his own intellectual class, of men generally--of all that  ever should come after him, or should sit on thrones under the  denominations of Czars, Kesars, or Caesars of the Bosphorus and the  Danube; of all in every age that should inherit his supremacy of mind,  or should subject to themselves the generations of ordinary men by  qualities analogous to his. Of this infinite superiority some part must  be ascribed to his early emancipation from paternal control. There are  very many cases in which, simply from considerations of sex, a female  cannot stand forward as the head of a family, or as its suitable  representative. If they are even ladies paramount, and in situations of  command, they are also women. The staff of authority does not annihilate  their sex; and scruples of female delicacy interfere for ever to unnerve  and emasculate in their hands the sceptre however otherwise potent.  Hence we see, in noble families, the merest boys put forward to  represent the family dignity, as fitter supporters of that burden than  their mature mothers. And of Caesar's mother, though little is recorded,  and that little incidentally, this much at least we learn--that, if she  looked down upon him with maternal pride and delight, she looked up to  him with female ambition as the re-edifier of her husband's honours,--  looked with reverence as to a column of the Roman grandeur and with fear  and feminine anxieties as to one whose aspiring spirit carried him but  too prematurely into the fields of adventurous strife. One slight and  evanescent sketch of the relations which subsisted between Caesar and  his mother, caught from the wrecks of time, is preserved both by  Plutarch and Suetonius. We see in the early dawn the young patrician  standing upon the steps of his patrimonial portico, his mother with her  arms wreathed about his neck, looking up to his noble countenance,  sometimes drawing auguries of hope from features so fitted for command,  sometimes boding an early blight to promises so dangerously magnificent.  That she had something of her son's aspiring character, or that he  presumed so much in a mother of his, we learn from the few words which  survive of their conversation. He addressed to her no language that  could tranquillise her fears. On the contrary, to any but a Roman mother  his valedictory words, taken in connexion with the known determination  of his character, were of a nature to consummate her depression, as they  tended to confirm the very worst of her fears. He was then going to  stand his chance in a popular electioneering contest for an office of  the highest dignity, and to launch himself upon the storms of the Campus  Martius. At that period, besides other and more ordinary dangers, the  bands of gladiators, kept in the pay of the more ambitious or turbulent  amongst the Roman nobles, gave a popular tone of ferocity and of  personal risk to the course of such contests; and, either to forestall  the victory of an antagonist, or to avenge their own defeat, it was not  at all impossible that a body of incensed competitors might intercept  his final triumph by assassination. For this danger, however, he had no  leisure in his thoughts of consolation; the sole danger which _he_  contemplated, or supposed his mother to contemplate, was the danger of  defeat, and for that he reserved his consolations. He bade her fear  nothing; for that his determination was to return with victory, and with  the ensigns of the dignity he sought, or to return a corpse.    Early indeed did Caesar's trials commence; and it is probable, that, had  not the death of his father, by throwing him prematurely upon his own  resources, prematurely developed the masculine features of his  character, forcing him whilst yet a boy under the discipline of civil  conflict and the yoke of practical life, even _his_ energies might have  been insufficient to sustain them. His age is not exactly ascertained;  but it is past a doubt that he had not reached his twentieth year when  he had the hardihood to engage in a struggle with Sylla, then Dictator,  and exercising the immoderate powers of that office with the licence and  the severity which History has made so memorable. He had neither any"]]]
