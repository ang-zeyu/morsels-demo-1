Each project title is  followed by its original page number to allow use of the  alphabetical contents (index) at the end of the book. The book  used very complex typesetting to conserve space. This  transcription uses simple one-column linear layout.    The text only version is of limited use because of the widespread  occurrence of  diagrams and illustrations. Use the pdf version for  the complete text.    Many projects are of contemporary interest--magic, kites and  boomerangs for example. Try a \"Querl\" for starters.    There are many projects of purely historical interest, such as  chemical photography, phonographs, and devices for coal  furnaces.    Another class of projects illustrate the caviler attitude toward  environment and health in 1913. These projects involve items  such as gunpowder, acetylene, hydrogen, lead, mercury, sulfuric  acid, nitric acid, cadmium, potassium sulfate, potassium cyanide,  potassium ferrocyanide, copper sulfate, and hydrochloric acid.  Several involve the construction of hazardous electrical devices.  Please view these as snapshots of culture and attitude, not as  suggestions for contemporary activity.    Be careful and have fun or simply read and enjoy a trip into  yesterday.

H. WINDSOR CHICAGO  POPULAR MECHANICS CO.  PUBLISHERS        ** A Model Steam Engine [1]    The accompanying sketch illustrates a two-cylinder single-acting,  poppet valve steam engine of home construction.    The entire engine, excepting the flywheel, shaft, valve cams,  pistons and bracing rods connecting the upper and lower plates of  the frame proper, is of brass, the other parts named being of cast  iron and bar steel.    The cylinders, G, are of seamless brass tubing, 1-1/2 in. outside  diameter; the pistons, H, are ordinary 1-1/2 in. pipe caps turned  to a plug fit, and ground into the cylinders with oil and emery.  This operation also finishes the inside of the cylinders.    The upright rods binding the top and bottom plates are of steel  rod about 1/8-in. in diameter, threaded into the top plate and  passing through holes in the bottom plate with hexagonal brass  nuts beneath.    The valves, C, and their seats, B, bored with a countersink bit,  are plainly shown. The valves were made by threading a copper  washer, 3/8 in. in diameter, and screwing it on the end of the  valve rod, then wiping on roughly a tapered mass of solder and  grinding it into the seats B with emery and oil.    The valve rods operate in guides, D, made of 1/4-in. brass tubing,  which passes through the top plate and into the heavy brass bar  containing the valve seats and steam passages at the top, into  which they are plug-fitted and soldered.    The location and arrangement of the valve seats and steam passages  are shown in the sketch, the flat bar containing them being  soldered to the top plate.    The steam chest, A, over the valve mechanism is constructed of    [Illustration: Engine Details]    1-in. square brass tubing, one side being sawed out and the open  ends fitted with pieces of 1/16 in. sheet brass and soldered. in.  The steam inlet is a gasoline pipe connection such as used on  automobiles.    The valve-operating cams, F, are made of the metal ends of an old  typewriter platen, one being finished to shape and then firmly  fastened face to face to the other, and used as a pattern in  filing the other to shape. Attachment to the shaft, N, is by means  of setscrews which pass through the sleeves.    The main bearings, M, on the supports, O, and the crank-end  bearings of the connecting rods, K, are split and held in position  by machine screws with provision for taking them up when worn.    The exhausting of spent steam is accomplished by means of slots,  I, sawed into the fronts of the cylinders at about 1/8 in. above  the lowest position of the piston's top at the end of the stroke,  at which position of the piston the valve rod drops into the  cutout portion of the cam and allows the valve to seat.    All the work on this engine, save turning the pistons, which was  done in a machine shop for a small sum, and making the flywheel,  this being taken from an old dismantled model, was accomplished  with a hacksaw, bench drill, carborundum wheel, files, taps and  dies. The base, Q, is made of a heavy piece of brass.    The action is smooth and the speed high. Steam is supplied by a  sheet brass boiler of about 3 pt. capacity, heated with a Bunsen  burner.  --Contributed by Harry F. Lowe, Washington, D. C.        ** Magic Spirit Hand [2]    The magic hand made of wax is given to the audience for  examination, also a board which is suspended by four pieces of  common picture-frame wire. The hand is placed upon the board and  answers, by rapping, any question asked by members of the  audience. The hand and the board may be examined at any time and  yet the rapping can be continued, though surrounded by the  audience.    The Magic Wand, London, gives the secret of this spirit hand as  follows: The hand is prepared by concealing in the wrist a few  soft iron plates, the wrist being afterwards bound with black  velvet as shown in Fig. 1. The board is hollow, the top being made  of thin veneer (Fig. 2). A small magnet, A, is connected to a  small flat pocket lamp battery, B. The board is suspended by four  lengths of picture-frame wire one of which, E, is    [Illustration: Wax Hand on Board and Electrical Connections]    connected to the battery and another, D, to the magnet. The other  wires, F and G, are only holding wires. All the wires are fastened  to a small ornamental switch, H, which is fitted with a connecting  plug at the top. The plug can be taken out or put in as desired.    The top of the board must be made to open or slide off so that  when the battery is exhausted a new one can be installed.  Everything must be firmly fixed to the board and the hollow space  filled in with wax, which will make the board sound solid when  tapped.    In presenting the trick, the performer gives the hand and board  with wires and switch for examination, keeping the plug concealed  in his right hand. When receiving the board back, the plug is  secretly pushed into the switch, which is held in the right hand.  The hand is then placed on the board over the magnet. When the  performer wishes the hand to move he pushes the plug in, which  turns on the current and causes the magnet to attract the iron in  the wrist, and will, therefore, make the hand rap. The switch can  be made similar to an ordinary push button so the rapping may be  easily controlled without detection by the audience.          ** Making Skis and Toboggans [3]    During the winter months everyone is thinking of skating, coasting  or ski running and jumping. Those too timid to run down a hill  standing upright on skis must take their pleasure in coasting or  skating.    The ordinary ski can be made into a coasting ski-toboggan by  joining two pairs together with bars without injury to their use  for running and jumping. The ordinary factory-made skis cost from  $2.50 per pair up, but any boy can make an excellent pair far 50  cents.    In making a pair of skis, select two strips of Norway pine free  from knots, 1 in. thick, 4 in. wide and 7 or 8 ft. long. Try to  procure as fine and straight a grain as possible. The pieces are  dressed thin at both ends leaving about 1 ft. in the center the  full thickness of 1 in., and gradually thinning to a scant 1/2 in.  at the ends. One end of each piece is tapered to a point beginning  12 in. from the end. A groove is cut on the under side, about 1/4  in. wide and 1/8 in. deep, and running almost the full length of  the ski. This will make it track straight and tends to prevent  side slipping. The shape of each piece for a ski, as it appears  before bending, is shown in Fig. 1.    The pointed end of each piece is placed in boiling water for at  least 1 hour, after which the pieces are ready for bending. The  bend is made on an ordinary stepladder. The pointed ends are stuck  under the back of one step and the other end securely tied to the  ladder, as shown in Fig. 2. They should remain tied to the ladder  48 hours in a moderate temperature, after which they will hold  their shape permanently.    The two straps, Fig. 3, are nailed an a little forward of the  center of gravity so that when the foot is lifted, the front    [Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 -- Forming the Skis]    of the ski will be raised. Tack on a piece of sheepskin or deer  hide where the foot rests, Fig. 4.    The best finish for skis is boiled linseed oil. After two or three    [Illustration: Fig. 4 -- The Toe Straps]    applications the under side will take a polish like glass from the  contact with the snow.    The ski-toboggan is made by placing two pairs of skis together  side by side    [Illustration: Fig. 5 -- Ski-Toboggan]    and fastening them with two bars across the top. The bars are held  with V-shaped metal clips as shown in Fig. 5.  --Contributed by Frank Scobie, Sleepy Eye, Minn.        ** Homemade Life Preserver [4]    Procure an inner tube of a bicycle tire, the closed-end kind, and  fold it in four alternate sections, as shown in Fig. 1.

BOURINOT, K.C.M.G., LL.D., LITT.D.    Author of 'Parliamentary Procedure and Practice', 'Constitutional  History of Canada,' 'The Story of Canada,' etc    WITH EIGHT MAPS    1900          CAMBRIDGE HISTORICAL SERIES    EDITED BY G. W. PROTHERO, LITT.D., LL.D.    Honorary Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and Late Professor of  History in the University of Edinburgh.                GENERAL PREFACE.    The aim of this series is to sketch the history of Modern Europe, with  that of its chief colonies and conquests, from about the end of the  fifteenth century down to the present time. In one or two cases the  story commences at an earlier date: in the case of the colonies it  generally begins later. The histories of the different countries are  described, as a rule, separately, for it is believed that, except in  epochs like that of the French Revolution and Napoleon I, the connection  of events will thus be better understood and the continuity of  historical development more clearly displayed.    The series is intended for the use of all persons anxious to understand  the nature of existing political conditions. \"The roots of the present  lie deep in the past\"; and the real significance of contemporary events  cannot be grasped unless the historical causes which have led to them  are known. The plan adopted makes it possible to treat the history of  the last four centuries in considerable detail, and to embody the most  important results of modern research. It is hoped therefore that the  series will be useful not only to beginners but to students who have  already acquired some general knowledge of European History. For those  who wish to carry their studies further, the bibliography appended to  each volume will act as a guide to original sources of information and  works more detailed and authoritative.    Considerable attention is paid to political geography, and each volume  is furnished with such maps and plans as may be requisite for the  illustration of the text.    G.W. PROTHERO.          PREFACE.    I devote the first chapter of this short history to a brief review of  the colonisation of the valley of the St. Lawrence by the French, and of  their political and social conditions at the Conquest, so that a reader  may be able to compare their weak and impoverished state under the  repressive dominion of France with the prosperous and influential  position they eventually attained under the liberal methods of British  rule. In the succeeding chapters I have dwelt on those important events  which have had the largest influence on the political development of the  several provinces as British possessions.    We have, first, the Quebec Act, which gave permanent guarantees for the  establishment of the Church of Rome and the maintenance of the language  and civil law of France in her old colony. Next, we read of the coming  of the United Empire Loyalists, and the consequent establishment of  British institutions on a stable basis of loyal devotion to the parent  state. Then ensued the war of 1812, to bind the provinces more closely  to Great Britain, and create that national spirit which is the natural  outcome of patriotic endeavour and individual self-sacrifice. Then  followed for several decades a persistent popular struggle for larger  political liberty, which was not successful until British statesmen  awoke at last from their indifference, on the outbreak of a rebellion in  the Canadas, and recognised the necessity of adopting a more liberal  policy towards their North American dependencies. The union of the  Canadas was succeeded by the concession of responsible government and  the complete acknowledgment of the rights of the colonists to manage  their provincial affairs without the constant interference of British  officials. With this extension of political privileges, the people  became still more ambitious, and established a confederation, which has  not only had the effect of supplying a remarkable stimulus to their  political, social and material development, but has given greater  security to British interests on the continent of North America. At  particular points of the historical narrative I have dwelt for a space  on economic, social, and intellectual conditions, so that the reader may  intelligently follow every phase to the development of the people from  the close of the French regime to the beginning of the twentieth century  In my summary of the most important political events for the last  twenty-five years, I have avoided all comment on matters which are \"as  yet\"--to quote the language of the epilogue to Mr. Green's \"Short  History\"--\"too near to us to admit of a cool and purely historical  treatment.\" The closing chapter is a short review of the relations  between Canada and the United States since the treaty of 1783--so  conducive to international disputes concerning boundaries and fishing  rights--until the present time, when the Alaskan and other international  controversies are demanding adjustment.    I have thought, too, that it would be useful to students of political  institutions to give in the appendix comparisons between the leading  provisions of the federal systems of the Dominion of Canada and the  Commonwealth of Australia. I must add that, in the revision of the  historical narrative, I have been much aided by the judicious criticism  and apt suggestions of the Editor of the Series, Dr. Prothero.

THE FRENCH REGIME. 1534--1760.      SECTION I.--Introduction.    Though the principal object of this book is to review the political,  economic and social progress of the provinces of Canada under British  rule, yet it would be necessarily imperfect, and even unintelligible in  certain important respects, were I to ignore the deeply interesting  history of the sixteen hundred thousand French Canadians, about thirty  per cent of the total population of the Dominion. To apply to Canada an  aphorism of Carlyle, \"The present is the living sum-total of the whole  past\"; the sum-total not simply of the hundred and thirty years that  have elapsed since the commencement of British dominion, but primarily  of the century and a half that began with the coming of Champlain to the  heights of Quebec and ended with the death of Wolfe on the Plains of  Abraham. The soldiers and sailors, the missionaries and pioneers of  France, speak to us in eloquent tones, whether we linger in summer time  on the shores of the noble gulf which washes the eastern portals of  Canada; whether we ascend the St. Lawrence River and follow the route  taken by the explorers, who discovered"]]]
