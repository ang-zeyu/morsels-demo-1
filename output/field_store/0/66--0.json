Illustrations of Shakspeare.           *       *       *       *       *    NO. XIII. ELSINEUR, FROM HAMLET'S GARDEN.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: ELSINEUR, FROM HAMLET'S GARDEN.]      We augur that the above will prove one of the most interesting of our  Shakspearian Illustrations, inasmuch as the garden where Hamlet was  wont to revel in the fitful dreams of his philosophic melancholy, is  holy ground. \"The lapse of ages and the fables of the poet,\" says a  delighted visiter, \"were all lost in the reality of Shakspeare's  painting: the moment of his scene seemed present with me; and eager to  traverse every part of this consecrated ground, I had already followed  Hamlet every where; I had measured the deep shadows of the platform,  encountered the grey ghost of the Royal Dane, had killed Polonius in  the queen's closet, and drowned poor Ophelia in the willowed stream.  The modern aspect of Elsineur is, however, far from inviting, and not  a single vestige presents itself that bears the smallest trace of this  town ever having been hallowed by the mausoleum of an Ophelia, or  proudly decorated with the stately walls of a royal palace.\"    About a mile from the town is a place that bears the name of Hamlet's  garden. Here is no relic of ancient interest, excepting the tradition,  which affirms that to be the spot where once stood the Danish palace,  and where was enacted that tragedy, which has been so gloriously  immortalized by the genius of our great dramatic bard.    The present edifice is erected on the brow of a gently rising hill,  the summit of which is gained by means of a winding walk cut through a  small shrubbery. In the surrounding prospect, the town of Elsineur, on  the plain beneath, presents itself ill-built, red, and without any  public building, or spire, to vary its sameness. Far to the left of  the city stands the castle of Kronenberg, a bold and fine feature;  the waves of the Cattegut roll at its feet; and are bounded on the  opposite side by the Swedish coast. When the annexed sketch was made,  400 sail of merchants' ships were lying there at anchor, which added  greatly to the interest of the picture. The small village on the  distant shore is Elsenberg. The forest of Kronenberg is indeed proudly  situated; the form of the building, with its spires and minarets, is  nobly picturesque; the fabric is of grey stone; and its innumerable  windows, varied towers, and other architectural ornaments, make it a  striking and beautiful contrast to the dull uniformity of the town.    Sir Robert Ker Porter, in his visit to this sacred spot, collected  a few interesting circumstances at the fountain-head, relating to  Shakspeare's northern hero, from the very source whence our poet must  have drawn the incidents of his tragedy, viz. the \"Annals of Denmark,\"  written by Saxo Grammaticus in the twelfth century. The work is in  Latin, and in our next number we intend inserting a short abstract of  Hamlet's story. It will be curious to compare the dialogues of the  original with their counterpart in the play.             *       *       *       *       *      ON THE APPEARANCE OF AN AURORA BOREALIS, ON THE NIGHT OF THE 25TH OF  SEPTEMBER.    BY A LADY IN HER THIRTEENTH YEAR.    (_For the Mirror_.)        What may this mean? this ruddy blaze of light,    Breaking effulgent through the stilly night;    Darting its blood-red form along the sky,    Glowing with heaven's glorious majesty.    How with its phalaxy of rays unfurl'd,    It comes: its radiance circling all our mother world.    The pharos of the night; where gods might dance.    Heedless of mortals dull, unmeaning trance;    Where spirits in their mysteries might find,    A sail to float upon the yielding wind;    But see, it flies, its shadow; form outspread,    In fainting radiance o'er earth's startled bed,    Yet rests, like the death gleam of beauty's eye,    Or last rich tint of an autumnal sky.    And now in fleecy clouds the heav'ns appear.    Again it darts, dreamer, there's naught to fear;    Again, like a proud spirit of the sky,    Though conquer'd, breaking forth in majesty.    Britain, for thee this fearful warning sent,    Oh! mock not foolishly its dire portent;    For now that vice on all her malice wreaks,    Charms on the stage, and in the assembly speaks;    Now that with cheating fires she shameless dares,    Fortunate where virtue once defied her snares;    Again I say, for thee this warning sent,    Oh! mark it well, mock not its dire portent.

(_By the author of Waverley_.)      [We have the pleasure of submitting to our readers, (almost entire,)  one of the stories of the forthcoming _Chronicles of the Canongate_,  it being the second narrative, and the last in the first volume, and  as well as the others, founded on true incidents. The _Chronicles_  are domestic tales; but the _Two Drovers_ should not be taken as a  specimen of the work. Slender as are its incidents, it proves that  \"Richard (or Walter) is himself again,\" for in no vein of writing is  the author of Waverley more felicitous than in delineating scenes of  actual life, splendid as are his narratives of the fairy scenes and  halls of romance: and in the prevailing taste for this description of  writing, we think the Chronicles of the Canongate bid fair to enjoy  popularity equal to any of Sir Walter's previous productions.]      _The Two Drovers_.    It was the day after the Doune Fair when my story commences. It had  been a brisk market, several dealers had attended from the northern  and midland counties in England, and the English money had flown so  merrily about as to gladden the hearts of the Highland farmers. Many  large droves were about to set off for England, under the protection  of their owners, or of the topsmen whom they employed in the tedious,  laborious and responsible office of driving the cattle for many  hundred miles, from the market where they had been purchased, to the  fields or farm-yards where they were to be fattened for the shambles.    Of the number who left Doune in the morning, and with the purpose we  have described, not a _Glunamie_ of them all cocked his bonnet more  briskly, or gartered his tartan hose under knee over a pair of more  promising _spiogs_ (legs), than did Robin Oig M'Combich, called  familiarly Robin Oig, that is Young, or the Lesser, Robin. Though  small of stature, as the epithet Oig implies, and not very strongly  limbed, he was as light and alert as one of the deer of his mountains.  He had an elasticity of step, which, in the course of a long march,  made many a stout fellow envy him; and the manner in which he busked  his plaid and adjusted his bonnet, argued a consciousness that so  smart a John Highlandman as himself would not pass unnoticed among the  Lowland lasses. The ruddy cheek, red lips, and white teeth, set off a  countenance which had gained by exposure to the weather, a healthful  and hardy rather than a rugged hue. If Robin Oig did not laugh,  or even smile frequently, as indeed is not the practice among his  countrymen, his bright eyes usually gleamed from under his bonnet  with an expression of cheerfulness ready to be turned into mirth.    The departure of Robin Oig was an incident in the little town, in  and near which he had many friends male and female. He was a topping  person in his way, transacted considerable business on his own behalf,  and was intrusted by the best farmers in the Highlands, in preference  to any other drover in that district. He might have increased his  business to any extent had he condescended to manage it by deputy; but  except a lad or two, sister's sons of his own, Robin rejected the idea  of assistance, conscious, perhaps how much his reputation depended  upon his attending in person to the practical discharge of his duty  in every instance. He remained, therefore, contented with the highest  premium given to persons of his description, and comforted himself  with the hopes that a few journeys to England might enable him to  conduct business on his own account, in a manner becoming his birth.  For Robin Oig's father, Lachlan M'Combich, (or, _son of my friend_,  his actual clan surname being M'Gregor,) had been so called by the  celebrated Rob Roy, because of the particular friendship which had  subsisted between the grandsire of Robin and that renowned cateran.  Some people even say, that Robin Oig derived his Christian name from a  man, as renowned in the wilds of Lochlomond, as ever was his namesake  Robin Hood, in the precincts of merry Sherwood. \"Of such ancestry,\"  as James Boswell says, \"who would not be proud?\" Robin Oig was proud  accordingly; but his frequent visits to England and to the Lowlands  had given him tact enough to know that pretensions, which still gave  him a little right to distinction in his own lonely glen, might be  both obnoxious and ridiculous if preferred elsewhere. The pride of  birth, therefore, was like the miser's treasure, the secret subject of  his contemplation, but never exhibited to strangers as a subject of  boasting.    Many were the words of gratulation and goodluck which were bestowed on  Robin Oig. The judges commended his drove, especially the best of them,  which were Robin's own property. Some thrust out their snuff-mulls for  the parting pinch--others tendered the _doch-an-dorrach_, or parting  cup. All cried--\"Good-luck travel out with you and come home with  you.--Give you luck in the Saxon market--brave notes in the  _leabhar-dhu_, (black pocket-book,) and plenty of English gold in the  _sporran_ (pouch"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11378"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration:]  Among the suburban beauties of the metropolis, and as an attraction for  home-tourists, Bushy is entitled to special notice, independent of its  celebrity as the retreat of royalty--it being the residence of _His  Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence_, an accurate portrait of whom will  be presented, to our readers with the usual _Supplementary Number_ at  the close of the present volume of the MIRROR.    _Bushy Park_ is an appendage to the palace and honour of Hampton Court;  and though far from assimilating to that splendid pile, it is better  fitted for rural enjoyment, whilst its contiguity to the metropolis  almost gives it the character of _rus in urbe_.[1] The residence is a  handsome structure, and its arrangement is altogether well calculated  for the indulgence of royal hospitality--a characteristic of its present  distinguished occupant, as well as of that glorious profession, to the  summit of which his royal highness has recently been exalted. The park,  too, is well stocked with deer, and its rangership is confided to the  duke. The pleasure grounds are tastefully disposed, and their beauty  improved by the judicious introduction of temples and other artificial  embellishments, among which, a naval temple, containing a piece of the  mast of the Victory, before which Nelson fell, and a bust of the noble  admiral, has been consecrated to his memory by the royal duke, with  devotional affection, and the best feelings of a warm heart.    [1] The Duke is a good economist of time; for what with excellent cattle  and the glory of Macadamized roads, his R.H. comes to town in the  morning, transacts his official business at the Admiralty, and  frequently returns to Bushy to dinner.    The park is a thoroughfare, and the circumstances by which this public  claim was established are worthy of record, as a specimen of the justice  with which the rights of the community are upheld in this country. The  _village Hampden_, in the present case, was one Timothy Bennet, of whom  there is a fine print, which the neighbours, who are fond of a walk in  Bushy Park, must regard with veneration. It has under it this  inscription:--\"Timothy Bennet; of Hampton Wick, in Middlesex, shoemaker,  aged 75, 1752. This true Briton, (unwilling to leave the world worse  than he found it,) by a vigorous application of the laws of his country  in the cause of liberty, obtained a free passage through Bushy Park,  which had many years been withheld from the public.\" Regeneration (or  the renewal of souls) is, however, a shoemaker's _forte_.    The above engraving of Bushy is copied from an elegant coloured view,  drawn by Ziegler, and published by Griffiths, of Wellington-street,  Strand.           *       *       *       *       *    THE FUGITIVE.    A SCOTCH TALE.    _(For the Mirror.)_    It was now abute the gloaming when my ain same Janet (heav'n sain her  saul) was sitting sae bieldy in a bit neuk ayant the ingle, while the  winsome weans gathering around their minnie were listing till some auld  spae wife's tale o' ghaists and worriecows; when on a sudden some ane  tirled at the door pin.    \"Here's your daddie, bairns,\" said the gudewife ganging till the door;  but i' place o' their daddie, a tall chiel wrappit i' a big cloak,  rushed like a fire flaught into the bield, and drappit doun on the  sunkie ewest the ingle droghling and coghling.    \"What's your wull, friend?\" said Janet, glowering on him a' i' a gliff,  \"the gudeman's awa.\"    \"Save me, save me,\" shrieghed the stranger, \"the sleuth hounds are at my  heels.\"    \"But wha may ye be, maister,\" cried the dame, \"I durstna dee your  bidding while Jamie's frae the hause.\"    \"Oh, dinna speir, dinna speir mistress,\" exclaimed the chiel a' in a  curfuffle, \"ainly for the loe of heav'n, hide me frae the red coats  whilk are comin' belive--O God, they are here,\" he cried, as I entered  the shealing, and uttering a piercing skirl, he sprung till the wa', and  thrawing aff his cloak, drew his broad claymore, whilk glittered  fearsome by the low o' the ingle.    \"Hauld, hauld, 'tis the gudeman his nainsell,\" shreighed Janet, when the  stranger drapping the point o' the sword, clingit till my hand, and  while the scauding tear draps tricklit adoun his face prigged me to fend  him.    \"Tak' your certie o' that my braw callant,\" said I, \"ne'er sail it be  tauld o' Jamie Mc-Dougall, that he steeked his door again the puir and  hauseless, an the bluidy sleuth hounds be on ye they'se find it ill  aneugh I trow to get an inkling o' ye frae me, I'se sune shaw 'em the  cauld shouther.\"    Sae saying, I gared him climb a rape by whilk he gat abune the riggin o'  the bield, then steeking to the door thro' whilk he gaed, I jimp had  trailed doun the rape, when in rinned twa red coat chiels, who couping  ilka ane i' their gait begun to touzle out the ben, and the de'il gaed  o'er Jock Wabster.    \"Eh, sirs! eh, sirs!\" cried I, \"whatna gaits' that to steer a bodie, wad  ye harry a puir chiel o' a' his warldly gear, shame till ye, shame till  ye, shank yoursell's awa.\"    \"Fusht, fusht, fallow,\" cried ane o' the churls, \"nane o' your bourds  wi' us, or ye may like to be the waur aff; where is the faus loon? we  saw him gae doun the loaning afore the shealing, and here he maun needs  be.\"    \"Aweel, sirs,\" I exclaimed, \"ye see there isna ony creatur here, our  nainsell's out-taken; seek again an ye winna creed a bodie; may be the  bogle is jumpit into the pot on the rundle-tree ower the ingle, or  creepit into the meal ark or aiblins it scoupit thro' the hole as ye cam  in at the door.
