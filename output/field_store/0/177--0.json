Composed on Divine Subjects.    3. Prepared for the Lord's Supper.    By I. Watts, D.D.      Revelation 5, 9.  _And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy, &c. for thou  wast slain, and hast redeemed us, &c._    Soliti essent (i.e. Christiani) convenire, carmenque Christo quasi  Deo dicere.  _Plin. In Epist._      Transcriber's Note.    There are significant differences in the numerous reprints of  Isaac Watts' \"Hymns and Spiritual Songs.\" The first generation  of this Project Gutenberg file was from an 1818 printing by C.  Corrall of 38 Charing Cross, London.    The \"Index\" and the \"Table of the Scriptures that are Turned into  Verse\" are retained, and can be found at the end of the text. The  \"Table to find any Hymn by the first Line,\" however, has been  omitted for the following reasons:  1. It refers to page numbers that are here expunged; and  2. In this electronic version first lines can be easily  located via searches.    There are 3 books of hymns, and numbers have been added to indicate  in which of these the hymns are placed. For example, \"2:38\" refers  to \"Book 2, Hymn Number 38,\" and so on.    Throughout, modern numerals have been substituted for their Roman  equivalents.        Preface.    The following extracts from the Doctor's preface contain the  substance of his plan in the three different parts into which the  Hymns are divided; the whole would have exceeded the limits of a  small book.    \"Far be it from my thoughts to lay aside the Book of Psalms in  public worship; few can pretend so great a value for them as  myself: it is the most noble, most devotional and divine collection  of poesy; and nothing can be supposed more proper to raise a pious  soul to heaven than some parts of that book; never was a piece of  experimental divinity so nobly written, and so justly reverenced  and admired. But it must be acknowledged still, that there are a  thousand lines in it which were not made for a church in our days  to assume as its own. There are also many deficiencies of light  and glory which our Lord Jesus and his apostles have supplied in  the writings of the New Testament: and with this advantage I have  composed these Spiritual Songs, which are now presented to the  World. Nor is the attempt vainglorious or presuming; for in respect  of clear evangelical knowledge, 'The least in the kingdom of heaven  is greater than all the Jewish Prophets.' Matt. xi. 11.    \"Now let me give a short account of the following composures.    \"The greatest part of them are suited to the general state of the  gospel, and the most common affairs of Christians: I hope there  will be very few found but what may properly be used in a religious  assembly, and not one of them but may well be adapted to some  seasons either of private or public worship. The most frequent  tempers and changes of our spirit, and conditions of our life,  are here copied, and the breathings of our piety expressed according  to the variety of our passions, our love, our fear, our hope, our  desire, our sorrow, our wonder and our joy, as they are refined  into devotion, and act under the influence and conduct of the  blessed Spirit; all conversing with God the Father 'by the new  and living Way' of access to the throne, even the person and the  mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ. To him also, even 'to the Lamb  that was slain and now lives,' I have addressed many a song; for  thus doth the holy Scripture instruct and teach us to worship in  the various patterns of Christian psalmody described in the  Revelation.    \"I have aimed at ease of numbers, and smoothness of sound, and  endeavoured to make the sense plain and obvious. If the verse  appears so gentle and flowing as to incur the censure of feebleness,  I may honestly affirm, that sometimes it cost me labour to make  it so.    \"In the first part I have borrowed the sense and much of the form  of the song from some particular portions of scripture, and have  paraphrased most of the doxologies in the New Testament, that  contain any thing in them peculiarly evangelical: and many parts  of the Old Testament also, that have a reference to the times of  the Messiah.    \"The second part consists of hymns whose form is mere human  composure; but I hope the sense and materials will always appear  divine. I might have brought some text or other, and applied it  to the margin of every verse, if this method had been as useful  as it was easy. If there be any poems in the book that are capable  of giving delight to persons of a more refined taste and polite  education, perhaps they may be found in this part; but except they  lay aside the humour of criticism, and enter into a devout frame,  every ode here already despairs of pleasing.    \"I have prepared the third part only for the celebration of the  Lord's Supper, that, in imitation of our blessed Saviour, we may  sing an hymn after we have partaken of the Bread and Wine.\"        Hymns.      Book 1.  Collected from the Holy  Scriptures.      Hymn 1:1.  A new song to the Lamb that was slain.  Rev. 5. 6 8 9 10 12.    1 Behold the glories of the Lamb  Amidst his Father's throne  Prepare new honours for his name,  And songs before unknown.    2 Let elders worship at his feet,  The church adore around,  With vials full of odours sweet,  And harps of sweeter sound.    3 Those are the prayers of the saints,  And these the hymns they raise:  Jesus is kind to our complaints,  He loves to hear our praise.    4 [Eternal Father, who shall look  Into thy secret will?  Who but the Son shall take that book  And open every seal?    5 He shall fulfil thy great decrees,  The Son deserves it well;  Lo, in his hand the sovereign keys  Of heaven, and death, and hell!]    6 Now to the Lamb that once was slain  Be endless blessings paid;  Salvation, glory, joy remain  For ever on thy head.    7 Thou hast redeem'd our souls with blood,  Hast set the pris'ners free,  Hast made us kings and priests to God,  And we shall reign with thee.    8 The worlds of nature and of grace  Are put beneath thy power;  Then shorten these delaying days,  And bring the promis'd hour.      Hymn 1:2.  The deity and humanity of Christ, John 1. 1-3 14.  Col. 9. 16. Eph. 3, 9 10.    1 Ere the blue heavens were stretch'd abroad,  From everlasting was the Word;  With God he was; the Word was God,  And must divinely be ador'd.    2 By his own power were all things made;  By him supported all things stand;  He is the whole creation's head,  And angels fly at his command.    3 Ere sin was born, or Satan fell,  He led the host of morning stars;  (Thy generation who can tell,  Or count the number of thy years?)    4 But lo, he leaves those heavenly forms,  The Word descends and dwells in clay,  That he may hold converse with worms,  Dress'd in such feeble flesh as they.    5 Mortals with joy beheld his face,  Th' eternal Father's only Son;  How full of truth! how full of grace!  When thro' his eyes the Godhead shone!    6 Archangels leave their high abode  To learn new mysteries here, and tell  The loves of our descending God,  The glories of Imannuel.      Hymn 1:3.  The nativity of Christ, Luke 1. 30 &c. Luke 2, 10 &c.    1 Behold, the grace appears,  The promise is fulfill'd;  Mary the wondrous virgin bears,  And Jesus is the child.    2 [The Lord, the highest God,  Calls him his only Son;  He bids him rule the lands abroad,  And gives, him David's throne.    3 O'er Jacob shall he reign  With a peculiar sway;  The nations shall his grace obtain,  His kingdom ne'er decay.]    4 To bring the glorious news  A heavenly form appears;  He tells the shepherds of their joys,  And banishes their fears.    5 \"Go, humble swains,\" said he,  \"To David's city fly;  \"The promis'd infant born to-day,  \"Doth in a manger lie.    6 \"With looks and heart serene,  \"Go visit Christ your King;\"  And straight, a flaming troop was seen;  The shepherds heard them sing:    7 \"Glory to God on high,  \"And heavenly peace on earth,  \"Good-will to men, to angels joy,  \"At the Redeemer's birth!\"    8 [In worship so divine  Let saints employ their tongues,  With the celestial host we join,  And loud repeat their songs:    9 \"Glory to God on high,  \"And heavenly peace on earth,  \"Good-will to men, to angels joy,  \"At our Redeemer's Birth.\"]      Hymn 1:4. [Supplement]  The inward witness to Christianity, 1 John 5. 10.    1 Questions and doubts be heard no more;  Let Christ and joy be all our theme;  His Spirit seals his gospel sure,  To every soul that trusts in him.    2 Jesus, thy witness speaks within:  The mercy which thy words reveal  Refines the heart from sense and sin,  And stamps its own celestial seal.    3 'Tis God's inimitable hand  That moulds and forms the heart anew;  Blasphemers can no more withstand,  But bow and own thy doctrine true.    4 The guilty wretch that trusts thy blood,  Finds peace and pardon at thy cross;  The sinful soul averse to God,  Believes and loves his Maker's laws.    5 Learning and wit may cease their strife,  When miracles with glory shine;  The voice that calls the dead to life  Must be almighty, and divine.      Hymn 1:5.  Submission to afflictive providences, Job 1. 21.    1 Naked as from the earth we came,  And crept to life at first,  We to the earth return again,  And mingle with our dust.    2 The dear delights we here enjoy,  And fondly call our own,  Are but short favours borrow'd now,  To be repaid anon.    3 'Tis God that lifts our comforts high,  Or sinks them in the grave;  He gives, and (blessed be his name!)  He takes but what he gave.    4 Peace, all our angry passions, then,  Let each rebellious sigh  Be silent at his sov'reign will,  And every murmur die.    5 If smiling mercy crown our lives,  Its praises shall be spread;  And we'll adore the justice too  That strikes our comforts dead.

In the Lanes          CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTION      I think that some of you have been with me at Willow Farm before to-day.  When we were there we went into the farmer's fields in early spring, and  saw the men and horses at work with ploughs and harrows. A little later  on we saw some of the crops sown, such as barley and turnips. In summer  we were in the hay-and corn-fields, and later still we saw the ricks  being made.    To-day we are at Willow Farm again, and I want to show you some of the  flowers that grow there. I do not mean those which Mrs. Hammond, the  farmer's wife, grows in her garden, pretty as they are. We will look  rather at the wild flowers in the fields, the hedges, and by the  road-side in the lane. No one sows their seed nor takes care of them in  any way; yet they grow and blossom year after year, and nearly all of  them are beautiful.    Before we begin to look at them we must make sure that we quite  understand just what a flower is. Even those of you who live in large  towns and have perhaps never been in the country, see flowers of some  sort, I feel sure; you see them in shop windows and they are also often  sold in the streets. You have seen wallflowers and daffodils in the  spring, roses in the summer, violets in winter, as well as other kinds.  You do not need to be told that these are flowers.    What about the grass on lawns, and in such places as Battersea Park and  Hyde Park in London? \"Oh,\" you say, \"that is not a flower at all--that  is just grass.\" Yes, it is grass, but the grass has a flower as well as  a rose bush or a violet-plant. It is only because the grass is kept cut  short that you do not see its flower on a lawn. If grass is not cut, or  eaten by animals, it grows tall in spring; then in May or June you would  see the flowers on tall straight stems which stand among the blades of  grass. Many of these grass flowers are very beautiful and we will look  presently at some of them in one of the farmer's fields.    Perhaps some of you have gardens or grass plots at your own homes. If  you see some dandelions in the lawn, or groundsel among the flowers or  vegetables in the garden beds, you say, \"Those weeds must be pulled up.\"  You call the Dandelion and the Groundsel weeds, but they have flowers  all the same; the Dandelion is perhaps one of the most lovely yellow  flowers that we have.    They are weeds certainly in your lawn or garden beds, for they ought not  to be there. Weeds are plants in the wrong place. By and by, in the  farmer's fields, we shall see many pretty flowers which he calls weeds.  We speak of the Nettle as a weed, and do not usually admire it; yet the  Nettle has a flower, as we shall see.    Then what do you think of a tree having a flower? That is perhaps a new  idea to you. Yet if you look at a Horse-chestnut tree in June you will  see at once the large spikes of beautiful white flowers with which it is  covered. Apple trees have a beautiful pink, or pink and white flower,  and the Almond tree bears a lovely pink flower. All other trees have  flowers too, but they are often small. The flowers of the Oak and the  Beech are small, but, though you may not notice them, they are on the  tree each spring.    Almost all plants, including large trees, have flowers--they are  flowering plants. Just a few plants have no flower; ferns have none, nor  have the mosses and lichens which grow on walls and rocks and on the  stems of trees. Fungi, too, such as the mushroom, have no flowers.  Nearly all other plants have flowers. It is by the flower or blossom  that a plant is reproduced. After the flower has faded comes the fruit  and seed; the seed falls into the ground or is sown, and from it springs  another plant. Without the flower there would be no seed.    You see that there are rather more flowers than you had thought. Still,  while we are strolling in the fields and lanes at Willow Farm, we shall  look most at what are generally called flowers; we shall look at  comparatively small plants in which the flower or blossom is easily  noticed because it is large, or bright-coloured, or sweet-scented. But  while we are admiring a Daisy or a Dandelion in the spring, we must not  forget that the great Oak-tree above it also has a flower of its own--we  must remember that the Oak-tree also is a flowering plant.          CHAPTER II    IN THE COPPICE      Outside the front door of Willow Farm is a broad curving gravel drive,  at the far end of which a white gate opens into the lane. On one side of  this drive is a narrow strip of ground planted with flowers and shrubs,  and close to the front door there is a patch of grass on which stands a  large old mulberry tree.    On the other side of the drive is a lawn. Beyond that are more flowers  and then the vegetable garden; further on still is a little wood or  coppice of nut bushes. On this March morning we shall find some wild  flowers in this little wood.    Between the vegetable garden and the wood is a low grassy bank. It is  bright to-day with yellow primroses. The Primrose always blossoms early  here, for the bank is sunny and is sheltered from cold winds.    [Illustration: PRIMROSE.]    I daresay most of you have seen a Primrose before to-day. Each pale  yellow blossom is made up of five petals, which are joined together  forming a tube or corolla. The petals are notched or indented on the  outer edge. At the centre of the blossom, where the petals meet, each  petal is marked with a spot of darker yellow. Each flower grows alone on  a long slender stem. At the top of the stem is a kind of green tube out  of which the yellow blossom appears. The Primrose blossoms have a scent;  not strong, but very sweet and pleasant.    The leaves are called \"radical\" or \"root\" leaves. They are so called  because each leaf _appears_ to grow direct from the root. But the leaves  really grow from a short stem at the top of the root--a stem so short  that it does not appear above the ground at all.    Among the bushes of the coppice itself we will notice the flowers which  first catch our eye--the pretty blossoms of the Wood Anemone. The whole  coppice is starred with the beautiful white flowers. We pick one and see  that it has six--six what? \"Six petals,\" you say. No, these are not  petals, for the Anemone has none. They are sepals. The sepals of a plant  generally enclose the blossom before it is opened, and they are usually  green. In the Anemone the petals are absent; the sepals take their place  and are white instead of green. Their under side is often not pure  white, but is streaked with pale pink.    Several blossoms which we pick have six of these sepals. That is the  usual number, but sometimes there are only five, and sometimes more than  six.    The blossoms of the Anemone grow on longer and stronger stalks than  those of the Primrose, and on each stalk are three leaves. These leaves  grow round the stalk in a ring. Each leaf is \"tri-partite\"--in three  parts or divisions; the edges of these divided leaves are deeply  serrated. Besides the three leaves on each flower-stalk similar leaves  grow from underground stems which creep along not far below the surface  of the soil. Such creeping underground stems are usually called  \"rhizomes.\"    At the further side of the coppice, where a hedge separates it from the  little meadow called Home Close, are Sweet Violets. We catch their  fragrant scent before we see them, for the tiny flowers are half hidden  among broad green leaves. Each blossom has five petals of a dark purple  colour; there are white Sweet Violets too, but none are growing in our  little wood to-day.    At the base of the blossom--the part where it joins the stem--one of the  petals has a little spur which points back towards the stem. The blossom  is therefore said to be spurred; we may presently see other plants with  spurred flowers.    There is another violet which grows wild in England--the Dog Violet. It  is larger than our Sweet Violets here, but it has no scent.    [Illustration: ANEMONE.]    While we have been examining the flowers on the ground, the nut bushes  above our heads are waiting to remind us of what we said just now--that  trees also have flowers. The flowers of the nut bush or hazel are easily  seen, for they appear before the leaves are open. What we see to-day are  often called catkins, but the name which country children give them is  lambs'-tails. It is a very good name, too, for they are more like the  tail of some tiny lamb than anything else.    These catkins are yellowish-white in colour, and soft and almost woolly  to the touch. They hang in clusters from the hazel twigs, and in the  strong March wind which blows to-day, they shake and flutter like the  tails of lambs at play. Some of them leave a dusty powder on our fingers  when we handle them; that is the pollen of the flower.    It is not where these yellow \"catkins\" are dancing on the twigs to-day  that the hazel nuts will appear in autumn. The nuts will grow on twigs  where there are very small red flowers--something like tiny  paint-brushes. These are the female flowers; they will be fertilized by  the yellow pollen of the catkins, and will produce the nuts.          CHAPTER III    FLOWERS ON THE WALLS      Behind the narrow strip of ground with flowers and shrubs on the other  side of the drive there is a low stone wall. A piece of the lawn on  which the mulberry tree stands has been cut away, and a flight of steps  leads down to a"]]]
