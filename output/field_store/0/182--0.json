W. Mackail      William Morris, one of the most eminent imaginative writers of the  Victorian age, differs from most other poets and men of letters in  two ways--first, he did great work in many other things as well as in  literature; secondly, he had beliefs of his own about the meaning and  conduct of life, about all that men think and do and make, very  different from those of ordinary people, and he carried out these  views in his writings as well as in all the other work he did  throughout his life.    He was born in 1834. His father, a member of a business firm in the  City of London, was a wealthy man and lived in Essex, in a country  house with large gardens and fields belonging to it, on the edge of  Epping Forest. Until the age of thirteen Morris was at home among a  large family of brothers and sisters. He delighted in the country  life and especially in the Forest, which is one of the most romantic  parts of England, and which he made the scene of many real and  imaginary adventures. From fourteen to eighteen he was at school at  Marlborough among the Wiltshire downs, in a country full of beauty and  history, and close to another of the ancient forests of England, that  of Savernake. He proceeded from school to Exeter College, Oxford,  where he soon formed a close friendship with a remarkable set of young  men of his own age; chief among these, and Morris's closest friend for  the rest of his life, was Edward Burne-Jones, the painter. Study of  the works of John Ruskin confirmed them in the admiration which they  already felt for the life and art of the Middle Ages. In the summer  vacation of 1855 the two friends went to Northern France to see the  beautiful towns and splendid churches with which that country had been  filled between the eleventh and the fifteenth centuries; and there  they made up their minds that they cared for art more than for  anything else, such as wealth or ease or the opinion of the world,  and that as soon as they left Oxford they would become artists.  By art they meant the making of beauty for the adornment and  enrichment of human life, and as artists they meant to strive against  all that was ugly or mean or untruthful in the life of their own time.    Art, as they understood it, is one single thing covering the whole  of life but practised in many special forms that differ one from  another. Among these many forms of art there are two of principal  importance. One of the two is the art which is concerned with the  making and adorning of the houses in which men and women live; that is  to say, architecture, with all its attendant arts of decoration,  including sculpture, painting, the designing and ornamenting of  metal, wood and glass, carpets, paper-hangings, woven, dyed and  embroidered cloths of all kinds, and all the furniture which a house  may have for use or pleasure. The other is the art which is concerned  with the making and adorning of stories in prose and verse. Both of  these kinds of art were practised by Morris throughout his life. The  former was his principal occupation; he made his living by it, and  built up in it a business which alone made him famous, and which has  had a great influence towards bringing more beauty into daily domestic  life in England and in other countries also. His profession was thus  that of a manufacturer, designer, and decorator. When he had to  describe himself by a single word, he called himself a designer. But  it is the latter branch of his art which principally concerns us now,  the art of a maker and adorner of stories. He became famous in this  kind of art also, both in prose and verse, as a romance-writer and a  poet. But he spoke of it as play rather than work, and although he  spent much time and great pains on it, he regarded it as relaxation  from the harder and more constant work of his life, which was carrying  on the business of designing, painting, weaving, dyeing, printing and  other occupations of that kind. In later life he also gave much of his  time to political and social work, with the object of bringing back  mankind into a path from which they had strayed since the end of the  Middle Ages, and creating a state of society in which art, by the  people and for the people, a joy to the maker and the user, might be  naturally, easily, and universally produced.    Even as a boy Morris had been noted for his love of reading and  inventing tales; but he did not begin to write any until he had been  for a couple of years at Oxford. His earliest poems and his earliest  written prose tales belong to the same year, 1855, in which he  determined to make art his profession. The first of either that he  published appeared in the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine, which was  started and managed by him and his friends in 1856. In 1858, after he  had left Oxford, he brought out a volume of poems called, after the  title of the first poem in the book, \"The Defence of Guenevere.\" Soon  afterwards he founded, with some of his old Oxford friends and others  whom he had made in London, among whom Dante Gabriel Rossetti was the  leading spirit, the firm of Morris and Company, manufacturers and  decorators. His business, in which he was the principal and finally  the sole partner, took up the main part of his time. He had also  married, and built himself a beautiful small house in Kent, the  decoration of which went busily on for several years. Among all these  other occupations he almost gave up writing stories, but never ceased  reading and thinking about them. In 1865 he came back to live in  London, where, being close to his work, he had more leisure for other  things; and between 1865 and 1870 he wrote between thirty and forty  tales in verse, containing not less than seventy or eighty thousand  lines in all. The longest of these tales, \"The Life and Death of  Jason,\" appeared in 1867. It is the old Greek story of the ship Argo  and the voyage in quest of the Golden Fleece. Twenty-five other tales  are included in \"The Earthly Paradise,\" published in three parts  between 1868 and 1870.    During these years Morris learned Icelandic, and his next published  works were translations of some of the Icelandic sagas, writings  composed from six to nine hundred years ago, and containing a mass of  legends, histories and romances finely told in a noble language. These  translations were followed in 1876 by his great epic poem, \"Sigurd the  Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs.\" In that poem he retold a story  of which an Icelandic version, the \"Volsunga Saga,\" written in the  twelfth century, is one of the world's masterpieces. It is the great  epic of Northern Europe, just as the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" of Homer  are the chief epics of ancient Greece, and the \"AEneid\" of Virgil the  chief epic of the Roman Empire. Morris's love for these great stories  of ancient times led him to rewrite the tale of the Volsungs and  Niblungs, which he reckoned the finest of them all, more fully and on  a larger scale than it had ever been written before. He had already,  in 1875, translated the \"AEneid\" into verse, and some ten years later,  in 1886-87, he also made a verse translation of the \"Odyssey.\" In 1873  he had also written another very beautiful poem, \"Love is Enough,\"  containing the story of three pairs of lovers, a countryman and  country-woman, an emperor and empress, and a prince and peasant girl.  This poem was written in the form of a play, not of a narrative.    To write prose was at first for Morris more difficult than to write  poetry. Verse came naturally to him, and he composed in prose only  with much effort until after long practice. Except for his early tales  in the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine and his translations of Icelandic  sagas, he wrote little but poetry until the year 1882. About that time  he began to give lectures and addresses, and wrote them in great  numbers during the latter part of his life. A number of them were  collected and published in two volumes called \"Hopes and Fears for  Art\" and \"Signs of Change,\" and many others have been published  separately. He thus gradually accustomed himself to prose composition.  For several years he was too busy with other things, which he thought  more important, to spend time on storytelling; but his instinct forced  itself out again, and in 1886 he began the series of romances in prose  or in mixed prose and verse which went on during the next ten years.  The chief of these are, \"A Dream of John Ball,\" \"The House of  Wolfings,\" \"The Roots of the Mountains,\" \"News from Nowhere,\" \"The  Glittering Plain,\" \"The Wood beyond the World,\" \"The Well at the  World's End,\" \"The Water of the Wondrous Isles,\" and \"The Sundering  Flood.\" During the same years he also translated, out of  Icelandic and old French books, more of the stories which he had  long known and admired. \"The Sundering Flood\" was written in his last  illness, and finished by him within a few days of his death, in the  autumn of 1896.          INTRODUCTION TO SIGURD    By The Editors      The story of Sigurd is important to English people not only for its  wondrous beauty, but also on account of its great age, and of what it  tells us about our own Viking ancestors, who first knew the story.    The tale was known all over the north of Europe, in Denmark, in  Germany, in Norway and Sweden, and in Iceland, hundreds of years  before it was written down. Sometimes different names were given to  the characters, sometimes the events of the story were slightly  altered, but in the main points it was one and the same tale.    If we look at a map of Europe showing the nations as they were rather  more than "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13487"],[0,"The Ideal Bartender (#1)"],[1,"THE IDEAL BARTENDER    by    TOM BULLOCK    1917                DEDICATED    TO THOSE WHO ENJOY SNUG CLUB ROOMS, THAT THEY MAY LEARN THE ART OF  PREPARING FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS GOOD.    IS IT ANY WONDER THAT MANKIND STANDS OPEN-MOUTHED BEFORE THE BARTENDER,  CONSIDERING THE MYSTERIES AND MARVELS OF AN ART THAT BORDERS ON MAGIC?  RECIPES FOUND IN THIS BOOK HAVE BEEN COMPOSED AND COLLECTED, TRIED AND  TESTED, IN A QUARTER-CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE BY TOM BULLOCK OF THE ST.  LOUIS COUNTRY CLUB.          A testimonial from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which appeared in the  form of an editorial, Wednesday evening, May 28, 1913, at a time when  Col. Roosevelt was vindicating, by a libel suit, his reputation for  sobriety and temperance.          Colonel Roosevelt's fatal admission that he drank just a part of one      julep at the St. Louis Country Club will come very near losing his      case.        Who was ever known to drink just a part of one of Tom's? Tom, than      whom there is no greater mixologist of any race, color or condition      of servitude, was taught the art of the julep by no less than Marse      Lilburn G. McNair, the father of the julep. In fact, the very cup      that Col. Roosevelt drank it from belonged to Governor McNair, the      first Governor of Missouri, the great-grandfather of Marse Lilburn      and the great-great-grandfather of the julep.        As is well known, the Country Club mint originally sprang on the      slopes of Parnassus and was transplanted thence to the bosky banks      of Culpeper Creek, Gaines County, Ky., and thence to our own      environs; while the classic distillation with which Tom mingles it      to produce his chief d'oeuvre is the oft-quoted liquefied soul of a      Southern moonbeam falling aslant the dewy slopes of the Cumberland      Mountains.        To believe that a red-blooded man, and a true Colonel at that, ever      stopped with just a part of one of those refreshments which have      made St. Louis hospitality proverbial and become one of our most      distinctive genre institutions, is to strain credulity too far. Are      the Colonel's powers of self restraint altogether transcendent? Have      we found the living superman at last?        When the Colonel says that he consumed just a part of one he      doubtless meant that he did not swallow the Mint itself, munch the      ice and devour the very cup.            INTRODUCTION      I have known the author of \"The Ideal Bartender\" for many years, and it  is a genuine privilege to be permitted to testify to his qualifications  for such a work.    To his many friends in St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, Chicago and  elsewhere, my word will be superfluous, but to those who do not know  him, and who are to be the gainers by following his advices, it may  prove at the very beginning a stimulus to know something of his record  of achievement.    For the past quarter of a century he has refreshed and delighted the  members and their friends of the Pendennis Club of Louisville and the  St. Louis Country Club of St. Louis. In all that time I doubt if he has  erred in even one of his concoctions. Thus if there is \"many a slip  twixt the cup and the lip\" it has been none of his doing, but rather the  fault of those who have appreciated his art too highly. But why go on!  His work is before you. It is the best to be had. Follow on, and as you  sip the nectar of his schemings tell your friends, to the end that both  they and he may be benefitted.    G. H.
