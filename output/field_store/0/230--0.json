It is a land of  rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and  precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River,  from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power  was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.    Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic  leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the  Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen  knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror  reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their  owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in  proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily  distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might  howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more  than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came  booming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to  learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among  the herds.    Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for  usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he  attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he  desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his  pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter  part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most of  them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in  command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader in  size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were  especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the  Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly  Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which,  according to current stories, had, on several occasions, captured an  antelope for the pack.    It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to  the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard,  and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen,  who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the  Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for  the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed  lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all  hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years, to  exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many  said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band  had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only  too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.    The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and  therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the truth  in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and  well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate.  Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or  tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that had  been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the  tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow  they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt,  it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet.  It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often  amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca  and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for  the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.    These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the  ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction  were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all  the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in  consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but  he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared--that  was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried  them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the  set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the  daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of  permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed,  was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to  detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their  immunity.    On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry  of Old Lobo, and stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in  a hollow, where they had 'rounded up' a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat  apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut  out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing  in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a  line of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset  of the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only  by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all  in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and  it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he  left his position on the hill, and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward  the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among  them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away  went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was  upon her. Seizing her by the neck he suddenly held back with all his  force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been  tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned  a somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers  falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part  in the killing--after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, \"Now,  why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much  time?\"    The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he,  having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three  places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had  killed the animals themselves. But next morning, on going to look for  his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the  heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that  had been poisoned.    The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and each  year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached  $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been  hunted down for less. Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger  named Tannerey came one day galloping up the canon of the Currumpaw. He  had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting--the best of guns and horses, and a  pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Panhandle, he  and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that,  within a few days, old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddle-bow.    Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer  morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they  were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly  band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious.  The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till  the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on  the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came  into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky  canons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in  every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these and  by crossing it got rid of the horsemen. His band then scattered and  thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point of  course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves, no longer  outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded  them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them  returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated.

XIII          Preface      This volume will come, I fancy, as a surprise both to my brother  folk-lorists and to the public in general. It might naturally have been  thought that my former volume (_English Fairy Tales_) had almost  exhausted the scanty remains of the traditional folk-tales of England.  Yet I shall be much disappointed if the present collection is not found  to surpass the former in interest and vivacity, while for the most part  it goes over hitherto untrodden ground, the majority of the tales in  this book have either never appeared before, or have never been brought  between the same boards.    In putting these tales together, I have acted on the same principles as  in the preceding volume, which has already, I am happy to say,  established itself as a kind of English Grimm. I have taken English  tales wherever I could find them, one from the United States, some from  the Lowland Scotch, and a few have been adapted from ballads, while I  have left a couple in their original metrical form. I have rewritten  most of them, and in doing so have adopted the traditional English style  of folk-telling, with its \"Wells\" and \"Lawkamercy\" and archaic touches,  which are known nowadays as vulgarisms. From former experience, I find  that each of these principles has met with some dissent from critics who  have written from the high and lofty standpoint of folk-lore, or from  the lowlier vantage of \"mere literature.\" I take this occasion to soften  their ire, or perhaps give them further cause for reviling.    My folk-lore friends look on with sadness while they view me laying  profane hands on the sacred text of my originals. I have actually at  times introduced or deleted whole incidents, have given another turn to  a tale, or finished off one that was incomplete, while I have had no  scruple in prosing a ballad or softening down over-abundant dialect.  This is rank sacrilege in the eyes of the rigid orthodox in matters  folk-lorical. My defence might be that I had a cause at heart as sacred  as our science of folk-lore--the filling of our children's imaginations  with bright trains of images. But even on the lofty heights of folk-lore  science I am not entirely defenceless. Do my friendly critics believe  that even Campbell's materials had not been modified by the various  narrators before they reached the great J.F.? Why may I not have the  same privilege as any other story-teller, especially when I know the  ways of story-telling as she is told in English, at least as well as a  Devonshire or Lancashire peasant? And--conclusive argument--wilt thou,  oh orthodox brother folk-lorist, still continue to use Grimm and  Asbjoernsen? Well, they did the same as I.    Then as to using tales in Lowland Scotch, whereat a Saturday Reviewer,  whose identity and fatherland were not difficult to guess, was so  shocked. Scots a dialect of English! Scots tales the same as English!  Horror and Philistinism! was the Reviewer's outcry. Matter of fact is my  reply, which will only confirm him, I fear, in his convictions. Yet I  appeal to him, why make a difference between tales told on different  sides of the Border? A tale told in Durham or Cumberland in a dialect  which only Dr. Murray could distinguish from Lowland Scotch, would on  all hands be allowed to be \"English.\" The same tale told a few miles  farther North, why should we refuse it the same qualification? A tale in  Henderson is English: why not a tale in Chambers, the majority of whose  tales are to be found also south of the Tweed?    The truth is, my folk-lore friends and my Saturday Reviewer differ with  me on the important problem of the origin of folk-tales. They think that  a tale probably originated where it was found. They therefore attribute  more importance than I to the exact form in which it is found and  restrict it to the locality of birth. I consider the probability to lie  in an origin elsewhere: I think it more likely than not that any tale  found in a place was rather brought there than born there. I have  discussed this matter elsewhere[1] with all the solemnity its  importance deserves, and cannot attempt further to defend my position  here. But even the reader innocent of folk-lore can see that, holding  these views, I do not attribute much anthropological value to tales  whose origin is probably foreign, and am certainly not likely to make a  hard-and-fast division between tales of the North Countrie and those  told across the Border.    As to how English folk-tales should be told authorities also differ. I  am inclined to follow the tradition of my old nurse, who was not bred at  Girton and who scorned at times the rules of Lindley Murray and the  diction of smart society. I have been recommended to adopt a diction not  too remote from that of the Authorised Version. Well, quite apart from  memories of my old nurse, we have a certain number of tales actually  taken down from the mouths of the people, and these are by no means in  Authorised form; they even trench on the \"vulgar\"--_i.e._, the archaic.  Now there is just a touch of snobbery in objecting to these archaisms  and calling them \"vulgar.\" These tales have been told, if not from time  immemorial, at least for several generations, in a special form which  includes dialect and \"vulgar\" words. Why desert that form for one which  the children cannot so easily follow with \"thous\" and \"werts\" and all  the artificialities of pseudo-Elizabethan? Children are not likely to  say \"darter\" for \"daughter,\" or to ejaculate \"Lawkamercyme\" because they  come across these forms in their folk-tales. They recognise the unusual  forms while enjoying the fun of them. I have accordingly retained the  archaisms and the old-world formulae which go so well with the folk-tale.    In compiling the present collection I have drawn on the store of 140  tales with which I originally started; some of the best of these I  reserved for this when making up the former one. That had necessarily to  contain the old favourites _Jack the Giant Killer, Dick Whittington_,  and the rest, which are often not so interesting or so well told as the  less familiar ones buried in periodicals or folk-lore collections. But  since the publication of _English Fairy Tales_, I have been specially  fortunate in obtaining access to tales entirely new and exceptionally  well told, which have been either published during the past three years  or have been kindly placed at my disposal by folk-lore friends. Among  these, the tales reported by Mrs. Balfour, with a thorough knowledge of  the peasants' mind and mode of speech, are a veritable acquisition. I  only regret that I have had to tone down so much of dialect in her  versions. She has added to my indebtedness to her by sending me several  tales which are entirely new and inedited. Mrs. Gomme comes only second  in rank among my creditors for thanks which I can scarcely pay without  becoming bankrupt in gratitude. Other friends have been equally kind,  especially Mr. Alfred Nutt, who has helped by adapting some of the book  versions, and by reading the proofs, while to the Councils of the  American and English Folk-Lore Societies I have again to repeat my  thanks for permission to use materials which first appeared in their  publications. Finally, I have had Mr. Batten with me once again--what  should I or other English children do without him?    JOSEPH JACOBS.
