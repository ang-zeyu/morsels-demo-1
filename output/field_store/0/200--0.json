Reinforcements were sent out  from England in one of two ways--either all  the way round the Cape of Good Hope, or by  train through France and Italy down to the  desolate little seaport of Taranto, and thence  by transport over to Egypt, through the Suez  Canal, and on down the Red Sea to the Indian  Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The latter  method was by far the shorter, but the submarine  situation in the Mediterranean was  such that convoying troops was a matter of  great difficulty. Taranto is an ancient Greek  town, situated at the mouth of a landlocked  harbor, the entrance to which is a narrow  channel, certainly not more than two hundred  yards across. The old part of the town is  built on a hill, and the alleys and runways  winding among the great stone dwellings serve  as streets. As is the case with maritime towns,  it is along the wharfs that the most interest  centres. During one afternoon I wandered  through the old town and listened to the fisherfolk  singing as they overhauled and mended  their nets. Grouped around a stone archway  sat six or seven women and girls. They were  evidently members of one family--a grandmother,  her daughters, and their children.  The old woman, wild, dark, and hawk-featured,  was blind, and as she knitted she chanted  some verses. I could only understand occasional  words and phrases, but it was evidently  a long epic. At intervals her listeners would  break out in comments as they worked, but,  like \"Othere, the old sea-captain,\" she \"neither  paused nor stirred.\"    There are few things more desolate than  even the best situated \"rest-camps\"--the long  lines of tents set out with military precision,  the trampled grass, and the board walks; but  the one at Taranto where we awaited embarkation  was peculiarly dismal even for a rest-camp.  So it happened that when Admiral Mark  Kerr, the commander of the Mediterranean  fleet, invited me to be his guest aboard H.M.S.  _Queen_ until the transport should sail, it was  in every way an opportunity to be appreciated.  In the British Empire the navy is the \"senior  service,\" and I soon found that the tradition  for the hospitality and cultivation of its officers  was more than justified. The admiral had  travelled, and read, and written, and no more  pleasant evenings could be imagined than  those spent in listening to his stories of the  famous writers, statesmen, and artists who  were numbered among his friends. He had  always been a great enthusiast for the development  of aerial warfare, and he was recently  in Nova Scotia in command of the giant Handley-Page  machine which was awaiting favorable  weather conditions in order to attempt the nonstop  transatlantic flight. Among his poems  stands out the \"Prayer of Empire,\" which,  oddly enough, the former German Emperor  greatly admired, ordering it distributed  throughout the imperial navy! The Kaiser's  feelings toward the admiral have suffered an  abrupt change, but they would have been  even more hostile had England profited by  his warnings:        \"There's no menace in preparedness, no threat in being strong,      If the people's brain be healthy and they think no thought of wrong.\"    After four or five most agreeable days aboard the _Queen_ the word came to  embark, and I was duly transferred to the _Saxon_, an old Union Castle  liner that was to run us straight through to Busra.    As we steamed out of the harbor we were joined by two diminutive Japanese  destroyers which were to convoy us. The menace of the submarine being  particularly felt in the Adriatic, the transports travelled only by night  during the first part of the voyage. To a landsman it was incomprehensible  how it was possible for us to pursue our zigzag course in the inky  blackness and avoid collisions, particularly when it was borne in mind  that our ship was English and our convoyers were Japanese. During the  afternoon we were drilled in the method of abandoning ship, and I was put  in charge of a lifeboat and a certain section of the ropes that were to be  used in our descent over the side into the water. Between twelve and one  o'clock that night we were awakened by three blasts, the preconcerted  danger-signal. Slipping into my life-jacket, I groped my way to my station  on deck. The men were filing up in perfect order and with no show of  excitement. A ship's officer passed and said he had heard that we had  been torpedoed and were taking in water. For fifteen or twenty minutes we  knew nothing further. A Scotch captain who had charge of the next boat to  me came over and whispered: \"It looks as if we'd go down. I have just seen  a rat run out along the ropes into my boat!\" That particular rat had not  been properly brought up, for shortly afterward we were told that we were  not sinking. We had been rammed amidships by one of the escorting  destroyers, but the breach was above the water-line. We heard later that  the destroyer, though badly smashed up, managed to make land in safety.    We laid up two days in a harbor on the Albanian coast, spending the time  pleasantly enough in swimming and sailing, while we waited for a new  escort. Another night's run put us in Navarino Bay. The grandfather of  Lieutenant Finch Hatton, one of the officers on board, commanded the  Allied forces in the famous battle fought here in 1827, when the Turkish  fleet was vanquished and the independence of Greece assured.    Several days more brought us to Port Said, and after a short delay we  pushed on through the canal and into the Red Sea. It was August, and when  one talks of the Red Sea in August there is no further need for comment.  The _Saxon_ had not been built for the tropics. She had no fans, nor  ventilating system such as we have on the United Fruit boats. Some  unusually intelligent stokers had deserted at Port Said, and as we were in  consequence short-handed, it was suggested that any volunteers would be  given a try. Finch Hatton and I felt that our years in the tropics should  qualify us, and that the exercise would improve our dispositions. We got  the exercise. Never have I felt anything as hot, and I have spent August  in Yuma, Arizona, and been in Italian Somaliland and the Amazon Valley.  The shovels and the handles of the wheelbarrows blistered our hands.    [Illustration: Map of Mesopotamia showing region of the fighting. Inset,  showing relative position of Mesopotamia and other countries.]    We had a number of cases of heat-stroke, and the hospital facilities on a  crowded transport can never be all that might be desired. The first  military burial at sea was deeply impressive. There was a lane of Tommies  drawn up with their rifles reversed and heads bowed; the short, classic  burial service was read, and the body, wrapped in the Union Jack, slid  down over the stern of the ship. Then the bugles rang out in the haunting,  mournful strains of the \"Last Post,\" and the service ended with all  singing \"Abide With Me.\"    We sweltered along down the Red Sea and around into the Indian Ocean. We  wished to call at Aden in order to disembark some of our sick, but were  ordered to continue on without touching. Our duties were light, and we  spent the time playing cards and reading. The Tommies played \"house\" from  dawn till dark. It is a game of the lotto variety. Each man has a paper  with numbers written on squares; one of them draws from a bag slips of  paper also marked with numbers, calls them out, and those having the  number he calls cover it, until all the numbers on their paper have been  covered. The first one to finish wins, and collects a penny from each of  the losers. The caller drones out the numbers with a monotony only  equalled by the brain-fever bird, and quite as disastrous to the nerves.  There are certain conventional nicknames: number one is always \"Kelley's  eye,\" eleven is \"legs eleven,\" sixty-six is \"clickety click,\" and the  highest number is \"top o' the 'ouse.\" There is another game that would be  much in vogue were it not for the vigilance of the officers. It is known  as \"crown and anchor,\" and the advantage lies so strongly in favor of the  banker that he cannot fail to make a good income, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: \"A man's plumb crazy to go round blatting all he  knows\"]                            The Happy Family                              BY                          B.M.

General roundup was about to start, down that way, and there was stock  bought by the Flying U which ranged north of the Bear Paws.    It so happened that the owner of the Rocking R was entertaining a  party of friends at the ranch; it also happened that the friends were  quite new to the West and its ways, and they were intensely interested  in all pertaining thereto. Pink gathered that much from the crew,  besides observing much for himself. Hence what follows after.    Sherwood Branciforte was down in the blacksmith shop at the Rocking R,  watching one Andy Green hammer a spur-shank straight. Andy was what he  himself called a tamer of wild ones, and he was hard upon his riding  gear. Sherwood had that morning watched with much admiration the  bending of that same spur-shank, and his respect for Andy was  beautiful to behold.    \"Lord, but this is a big, wild country,\" he was saying  enthusiastically, \"and the people in it are big and--\"    \"Wild,\" supplied Andy. \"Yes, you've just about got us sized up  correct.\" He went on hammering, and humming under his breath, and  thinking that, while admiration is all right in its time and place, it  is sometimes a bit wearisome.    \"Oh, but I didn't mean that,\" the young man protested. \"What I meant  was breezy and picturesque. Things can happen, out here. Life and men  don't run in grooves.\"    \"No, nor horses,\" assented Andy. \"Leastways, not in oiled ones.\" He  was remembering how that spur-shank had become bent.    \"You did some magnificent riding, this morning. By Jove! I've never  seen anything like it. Strange that one can come out here into a part  of the country absolutely new and raw, and see things--\"    \"Oh, it ain't so raw as you might think,\" Andy defended jealously,  \"nor yet new.\"    \"Of course it is new! A commonwealth in the making. You can't,\" he  asserted triumphantly, \"point to anything man-made that existed a  hundred years ago; scarcely fifty, either. Your civilization is yet in  the cradle--a lusty infant, and a--er--vociferous one, but still an  infant in swaddling clothes.\" Sherwood Branciforte had given lectures  before the Y.M.C.A. of his home town, and young ladies had spoken of  him as \"gifted,\" and he had come to hear of it, and to believe.    Andy Green squinted at the shank before he made reply. Andy, also, was  \"gifted,\" in his modest Western way.    \"A country that can now and then show the papers for a civilization  old as the Phenixes of Egypt,\" he said, in a drawling tone that was  absolutely convincing, \"ain't what I'd call raw.\" He decided that a  little more hammering right next the rowel was necessary, and bent  over the anvil solicitously. Even the self-complacency of Sherwood  Branciforte could not fail to note his utter indifference to the  presence and opinions of his companion. Branciforte was accustomed to  disputation at times--even to enmity; but not to indifference. He  blinked. \"My dear fellow, do you realize what it is that statement  might seem to imply?\" he queried haughtily.    Andy, being a cowpuncher of the brand known as a \"real,\" objected  strongly both to the term and the tone. He stood up and stared down at  the other disapprovingly. \"I don't as a general thing find myself  guilty of talking in my sleep,\" he retorted, \"and I'm prepared to let  anything I say stand till the next throw. We may be some vociferous,  out here twixt the Mississippi and the Rockies, but we ain't no  infant-in-the-cradle, Mister. We had civilization here when the  Pilgrim Fathers' rock wasn't nothing but a pebble to let fly at the  birds!\"    \"Indeed!\" fleered Sherwood Branciforte, in a voice which gave much  intangible insult to one's intelligence.    Andy clicked his teeth together, which was a symptom it were well for  the other to recognize but did not. Then Andy smiled, which was  another symptom. He fingered the spur absently, laid it down and  reached, with the gesture that betrays the act as having become second  nature, for his papers and tobacco sack.    \"Uh course, you mean all right, and you ain't none to blame for what  you don't know, but you're talking wild and scattering. When you stand  up and tell me I can't point to nothing man-made that's fifty years  old, or a hundred, you make me feel sorry for yuh. I can take you to  something--or I've seen something--that's older than swearing; and I  reckon that art goes back to when men wore their hair long and a  sheep-pelt was called ample for dress occasions.\"    \"Are you crazy, man?\" Sherwood Branciforte exclaimed incredulously.    \"Not what you can notice. You wait whilst I explain. Once last fall I  was riding by my high lonesome away down next the river, when my horse  went lame on me from slipping on a shale bank, and I was set afoot. Uh  course, you being plumb ignorant of our picturesque life, you don't  half know all that might signify to _imply_.\" This last in open  imitation of Branciforte. \"It implies that I was in one hell of a fix,  to put it elegant. I was sixty miles from anywhere, and them sixty  half the time standing on end and lapping over on themselves. That  there is down where old mama Nature gave full swing to a morbid  hankering after doing things unconventional. Result is, that it's  about as ungodly a mixture of nightmare scenery as this old world can  show up; and I've ambled around considerable and am in a position to  pass judgment.    \"So there I was, and I wasn't in no mood to view the beauties uh  nature to speak of; for instance, I didn't admire the clouds sailing  around promiscous in the sky, nor anything like that. I was high and  dry and the walking was about as poor as I ever seen; and my boots was  high-heel and rubbed blisters before I'd covered a mile of that  acrobatic territory. I wanted water, and I wanted it bad. Before I got  it I wanted it a heap worse.\" He stopped, cupped his slim fingers  around a match-blaze, and Branciforte sat closer. He did not know what  was coming, but the manner of the indifferent narrator was compelling.  He almost forgot the point at issue in the adventure.    \"Along about dark, I camped for the night under a big, bare-faced  cliff that was about as homelike and inviting as a charitable  institution, and made a bluff at sleeping and cussed my bum luck in a  way that wasn't any bluff. At sun-up I rose and mooched on.\" His  cigarette needed another match and he searched his pockets for one.    \"What about the--whatever it was you started to tell me?\" urged  Branciforte, grown impatient.    Andy looked him over calmly. \"You've lived in ignorance for about  thirty years or so--giving a rough guess at your age; I reckon you can  stand another five minutes. As I was saying, I wandered around like a  dogy when it's first turned loose on the range and is trying to find  the old, familiar barn-yard and the skim-milk bucket. And like the  dogy, I didn't run across anything that looked natural or inviting.  All that day I perambulated over them hills, and I will say I wasn't  enjoying the stroll none. You're right when you say things can happen,  out here. There's some things it's just as well they don't happen too  frequent, and getting lost and afoot in the Bad-lands is one.    \"That afternoon I dragged myself up to the edge of a deep coulee and  looked over to see if there was any way of getting down. There was a  bright green streak down there that couldn't mean nothing but water,  at that time of year; this was last fall. And over beyond, I could see  the river that I'd went and lost. I looked and looked, but the walls  looked straight as a Boston's man's pedigree. And then the sun come  out from behind a cloud and lit up a spot that made me forget for a  minute that I was thirsty as a dog and near starved besides.    \"I was looking down on the ruins--and yet it was near perfect--of an  old"]]]
