His most diverting efforts had  failed to gain the usual reward of a caress, or at least a word of  understanding; and so, dog-like to express his sympathy, he came close  beside his friend and licked his hand. Always, before, this had called  attention to the fact that Baldy was ready to share any trouble with the  boy--but to-day the rough and grimy little hand, stiff and blue from the  cold, did not respond, and instead only brushed away the tears that  rolled slowly down the pinched cheeks. Sometimes the slight body shook  with sobs that the boy tried manfully to suppress; but when one is  chilled, and tired and hungry, and in the shadow of a Great Tragedy, the  emotions are not easy to control.    With unseeing eyes and dragging steps, the boy trudged along the snowy  trail, dreading the arrival at Golconda Camp. For there was the House of  Judgment, where all of the unfortunate events of that most unhappy day  would be reviewed sternly, though with a certain harsh justice, that  could result in nothing less than a sentence of final separation from  Baldy. And so when the dog in his most subtle and delicate manner showed  his deep love for the boy, it only made the thought of the inevitable  parting harder to bear.    So completely was Ben lost in his own gloomy reflections that he did not  hear the sound of bells behind him; and it was not until a cheery voice  called out demanding the right of way that he stepped aside to let a  rapidly approaching dog team pass. As it came closer he saw that it was  the Allan and Darling team of Racers, and for the moment his eyes  brightened with interest and admiration as he noticed with a true  dog-lover's appreciation the perfect condition of the fleet-footed dogs,  and the fine detail of sled and equipment.    Then his glance fell upon Baldy--thin, rough coated, and showing  evidences of neglect; upon Baldy to whom he could not now even offer  food and shelter, and a wave of bitterness swept over him.    \"Come along, sonny, if you're going our way,\" and in the kindly little  man at the handle-bars the boy recognized \"Scotty\" Allan, the most  famous dog driver in Alaska. To the boy \"Scotty\" represented all that  was most admirable in the whole North, and he stood speechless at the  invitation to ride with him behind a team that had always seemed as  wonderful as Cinderella's Fairy Coach. He hesitated, and then the Woman  in the sled beckoned encouragingly. \"Get in with me; and your dog may  come too,\" she said as she rearranged the heavy fur robes to make room.  The boy advanced with painful shyness, and awkwardly climbed into the  place assigned him. The Woman laid her hand on Baldy's collar to draw  him in also, but the boy exclaimed quickly, \"No, ma'am, don't do that,  please; he ain't really cross, but he won't ride in anythin' as long's  he's got a leg to stand on; an' sometimes he growls if people he don't  know touches him.\"    \"Dogs and boys never growl at me, because I love them; and he does not  look as if he really had a leg to stand on,\" she replied smilingly. But  the boy nervously persisted. \"Please let him go--his legs is all right.  He looks kind o' run down jest now 'cause he\"--the boy felt a tightening  at his throat, and winked hard to keep the tears from starting  again--\"'cause he ain't got much appetite. But when he's eatin' good his  legs is jest great. Why, there ain't no other dog in Golconda that's got  as strong legs as Baldy when he's--when he's eatin' good,\" he repeated  hastily. \"An' Golconda's plumb full o' fine dogs.\"    \"If that's so,\" said \"Scotty,\" \"I think I shall have to take a look at  those Golconda wonders before the winter fairly sets in; and maybe you  can give me a few pointers.\"    For a mile or so the boy sat spellbound, drinking in the casual comments  of \"Scotty\" upon the dogs in the team, as if they were pearls of wisdom  dropping from the lips of an Oracle. He was not so much interested in  the Woman's replies, for they displayed a lack of technical information  that contrasted unfavorably in the boy's mind with the keen and accurate  insight that Allan showed in every word on that most vital subject.    Vaguely the boy remembered having once heard that she had become a  partner in the racing team for mere amusement of the sport, instead of  from a serious, high-minded interest, and that of course did not entitle  her to the same respect you could feel for one to whom the care and  culture of the dog assumed the dignity of a vocation. Then, too, she had  spoken slightingly of Baldy's legs. As a human being he could not but  respond to her friendly overtures, but as a dog fancier she held no  place in his esteem.    As they approached the divide where the trail for Golconda branched from  the main road, an idea suddenly came to the boy. He had watched the  harmony between Allan and his dogs; had noted their willingness, their  affection for \"Scotty,\" and his consideration for them. And as the pace  became slower, and he realized that they were nearly at the end of this  fate-given interview, he tremblingly gasped out the question that had  been seething through his mind with such persistence. \"Mr. Allan, would  you like to buy Baldy?\"    \"Buy Baldy!\" exclaimed the man in surprise. \"Why, I thought you and  Baldy were chums--I had no idea he was for sale.\"    \"He wasn't till jest now, not till I saw how yer dogs love you; but I  got t' git rid of him. It's been comin' fer a long time, an' I guess  to-day's finished it.\"    The man leaned over and looked into the tear-stained face. \"Are you in  some trouble about him? Perhaps it's not so bad as you think, and maybe  we can help you without taking Baldy.\"    But the boy went on determinedly. \"No, sir, I want you to take him; it'd  be the best thing fer him, an' I kin stan' it someway. A feller has ter  stan' a lot o' things he don't like in this world, but I hope,\"  feelingly, \"all of 'em ain't as hard as givin' up his best friend.\"    As if to avoid the sympathy he felt was forthcoming, he plunged hastily  into the details that had led to the unexpected offer. \"I'm Ben Edwards.  Maybe you knew my father; he was killed in the cave-in on the June  Fraction. Baldy was only a little pup then, but Dad was awful fond of  him.\"    \"I remember,\" said the Woman thoughtfully; \"and you have been in  difficulties since, and need the money you could get for Baldy. Is that  it?\"    \"It ain't only the money, but none o' the men at the Camp care much fer  Baldy, an' they ain't kind to him. Only Moose Jones. When he was here he  wouldn't let the men tease Baldy ner me, an' he made the cook give me  scraps an' bones ter feed him. An' once he licked Black Mart fer  throwin' hot water on Baldy when he went ter the door o' Mart's cabin  lookin' fer me. I think Moose Jones is the best man in the world, an'  about the strongest,\" volunteered the boy loyally.    \"And where's Moose Jones now?\" asked \"Scotty.\" \"I used to see him  prospecting out near the Dexter Divide last winter.\"    \"He was at Dexter first, an' then he was at Golconda fer a while; but in  spring he went ter St. Michael, an' from there up ter the new strike at  Marshall.\"    \"And you miss him very much?\" questioned the Woman.    \"Yes, ma'am, I miss him a lot, an' so does Baldy. He was awful good ter  animals an' kids. He had a pet ermine that 'ud come in ter see him every  night in his cabin, an' he wouldn't let Mart an' some o' the fellers set  a trap fer the red mother fox that was prowlin' round the place t' git  somethin' fer her babies. Said he'd make trap-bait fer bears o' the  first feller that tried t' git 'er.\"    \"Excellent idea.\"    \"Oh, he didn't really mean it serious. Why, Moose is so kind he hates  ter kill anythin'--even fer food. Sometimes when he's been livin' on  bacon an' beans fer months, he lets a flock o' young ptarmigan fly by  him 'cause he says they look so soft an' pretty an' fluttery he don't  like ter shoot 'em; an' Moose is a dead shot.

Dakyns             Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a       pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,       and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land       and property in Scillus, where he lived for many       years before having to move once more, to settle       in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.         On Horsemanship advises the reader on how to buy       a good horse, and how to raise it to be either a       war horse or show horse. Xenophon ends with some       words on military equipment for a cavalryman.          PREPARER'S NOTE    This was typed from Dakyns' series, \"The Works of Xenophon,\" a  four-volume set. The complete list of Xenophon's works (though there is  doubt about some of these) is:         Work                                   Number of books         The Anabasis                                         7       The Hellenica                                        7       The Cyropaedia                                       8       The Memorabilia                                      4       The Symposium                                        1       The Economist                                        1       On Horsemanship                                      1       The Sportsman                                        1       The Cavalry General                                  1       The Apology                                          1       On Revenues                                          1       The Hiero                                            1       The Agesilaus                                        1       The Polity of the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians   2         Text in brackets \"{}\" is my transliteration of Greek text into       English using an Oxford English Dictionary alphabet table.

ON HORSEMANSHIP      I    Claiming to have attained some proficiency in horsemanship (1)  ourselves, as the result of long experience in the field, our wish is to  explain, for the benefit of our younger friends, what we conceive to be  the most correct method of dealing with horses.     (1) Lit. \"Since, through the accident of having for a long time      'ridden' ourselves, we believe we have become proficients in      horsemanship, we wish to show to our younger friends how, as we      conceive the matter, they will proceed most correctly in dealing      with horses.\" {ippeuein} in the case of Xenophon = serve as a      {ippeus}, whether technically as an Athenian \"knight\" or more      particularly in reference to his organisation of a troop of      cavalry during \"the retreat\" (\"Anab.\" III. iii. 8-20), and, as is      commonly believed, while serving under Agesilaus (\"Hell.\" III. iv.      14) in Asia, 396, 395 B.C.    There is, it is true, a treatise on horsemanship written by Simon, the  same who dedicated the bronze horse near the Eleusinion in Athens  (2) with a representation of his exploits engraved in relief on the  pedestal. (3) But we shall not on that account expunge from our treatise  any conclusions in which we happen to agree with that author; on the  contrary we shall hand them on with still greater pleasure to our  friends, in the belief that we shall only gain in authority from the  fact that so great an expert in horsemanship held similar views to our  own; whilst with regard to matters omitted in his treatise, we shall  endeavour to supply them.

A fragment of      the work referred to, {peri eidous kai ekloges ippon}, exists. The      MS. is in the library of Emmanual Coll. Cant. It so happens that      one of the hipparchs (?) appealed to by Demosthenes in Arist.      \"Knights,\" 242.    {andres ippes, paragenesthe nun o kairos, o Simon, o Panaiti, ouk elate  pros to dexion keras};    bears the name.     (3) Lit. \"and carved on the pedestal a representation of his own      performances.\"    As our first topic we shall deal with the question, how a man may best  avoid being cheated in the purchase of a horse.    Take the case of a foal as yet unbroken: it is plain that our scrutiny  must begin with the body; an animal that has never yet been mounted  can but present the vaguest indications of spirit. Confining ourselves  therefore to the body, the first point to examine, we maintain, will be  the feet. Just as a house would be of little use, however beautiful its  upper stories, if the underlying foundations were not what they ought  to be, so there is little use to be extracted from a horse, and in  particular a war-horse, (4) if unsound in his feet, however excellent  his other points; since he could not turn a single one of them to good  account. (5)     (4) Or, \"and that a charger, we will suppose.\" For the simile see      \"Mem.\" III. i. 7.     (5) Cf. Hor. \"Sat.\" I. ii. 86:    regibus hic mos est: ubi equos mercantur, opertos inspiciunt, ne, si  facies, ut saepe, decora molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat hiantem,  quod pulchrae clunes, breve quod caput, ardua cervix.    and see Virg. \"Georg.\" iii. 72 foll.    In testing the feet the first thing to examine will be the horny portion  of the hoof. For soundness of foot a thick horn is far better than a  thin. Again it is important to notice whether the hoofs are high both  before and behind, or flat to the ground; for a high hoof keeps the  \"frog,\" (6) as it is called, well off the ground; whereas a low hoof  treads equally with the stoutest and softest part of the foot alike,  the gait resembling that of a bandy-legged man. (7) \"You may tell a good  foot clearly by the ring,\" says Simon happily; (8) for the hollow hoof  rings like a cymbal against the solid earth. (9)     (6) Lit. \"the swallow.\"     (7) Al. \"a knock-kneed person.\" See Stonehenge, \"The Horse\" (ed.      1892), pp. 3, 9.     (8) Or, \"and he is right.\"     (9) Cf. Virg. \"Georg.\" iii. 88; Hor. \"Epod.\" xvi. 12.    And now that we have begun with the feet, let us ascend from this point  to the rest of the body. The bones (10) above the hoof and below the  fetlock must not be too straight, like those of a goat; through not  being properly elastic, (11) legs of this type will jar the rider, and  are more liable to become inflamed. On the other hand, these bones must  not be too low, or else the fetlock will be abraded or lacerated when  the horse is galloped over clods and stones.     (10) i.e. \"the pasterns ({mesokunia}) and the coffin should be      'sloping.'\"     (11) Or, \"being too inflexible.\" Lit. \"giving blow for blow, overuch      like anvil to hammer.\"    The bones of the shanks (12) ought to be thick, being as they are the  columns on which the body rests; thick in themselves, that is, not  puffed out with veins or flesh; or else in riding over hard ground they  will inevitably be surcharged with blood, and varicose conditions be set  up, (13) the legs becoming thick and puffy, whilst the skin recedes; and  with this loosening of the skin the back sinew (14) is very apt to start  and render the horse lame.     (12) i.e. \"the metacarpals and metatarsals.\"     (13) Or, \"and become varicose, with the result that the shanks swell      whilst the skin recedes from the bone.\"     (14) Or, \"suspensory ligament\"? Possibly Xenophon's anatomy is wrong,      and he mistook the back sinew for a bone like the fibula. The part      in question might intelligibly enough, if not technically, be      termed {perone}, being of the brooch-pin order.    If the young horse in walking bends his knees flexibly, you may safely  conjecture that when he comes to be ridden he will have flexible legs,  since the quality of suppleness invariably increases with age. (15)  Supple knees are highly esteemed and with good reason, rendering as  they do the horse less liable to stumble or break down from fatigue than  those of stiffer build.     (15) Lit. \"all horses bend their legs more flexibly as time advances.\"    Coming to the thighs below the shoulder-blades, (16) or arms, these if  thick and muscular present a stronger and handsomer appearance, just  as in the case of a human being. Again, a comparatively broad chest is  better alike for strength and beauty, and better adapted to carry the  legs well asunder, so that they will not overlap and interfere with one  another. Again, the neck should not be set on dropping forward from the  chest, like a boar's, but, like that of a game-cock rather, it should  shoot upwards to the crest, and be slack (17) along the curvature;  whilst the head should be bony and the jawbone small. In this way the  neck will be well in front of the rider, and the eye will command what  lies before the horse's feet. A horse, moreover, of this build, however  spirited, will be least capable of overmastering the rider, (18) since  it is not by arching but by stretching out his neck and head that a  horse endeavours to assert his power. (19)     (16) Lit. \"the thighs below the shoulder-blades\" are distinguished      from \"the thighs below the tail.\" They correspond respectively to      our \"arms\" (i.e. forearms) and \"gaskins,\" and anatomically      speaking = the radius (os brachii) and the tibia.     (17) \"Slack towards the flexure\" (Stonehenge).     (18) Or, \"of forcing the rider's hand and bolting.\"     (19) Or, \"to display violence or run away.\"    It is important also to observe whether the jaws are soft or hard on one  or other side, since as a rule a horse with unequal jaws (20) is liable  to become hard-mouthed on one side.     (20) Or, \"whose bars are not equally sensitive.\"    Again, a prominent rather than a sunken eye is suggestive of alertness,  and a horse of"]]]
