[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#1)"],[1,"AND THE NEXT WAR        BY GENERAL FRIEDRICH VON BERNHARDI        TRANSLATED BY ALLEN H. POWLES      1912        All the patriotic sections of the German people were greatly excited  during the summer and autumn of 1911. The conviction lay heavy on all  hearts that in the settlement of the Morocco dispute no mere commercial  or colonial question of minor importance was being discussed, but that  the honour and future of the German nation were at stake. A deep rift  had opened between the feeling of the nation and the diplomatic action  of the Government. Public opinion, which was clearly in favour of  asserting ourselves, did not understand the dangers of our political  position, and the sacrifices which a boldly-outlined policy would have  demanded. I cannot say whether the nation, which undoubtedly in an  overwhelming majority would have gladly obeyed the call to arms, would  have been equally ready to bear permanent and heavy burdens of taxation.  Haggling about war contributions is as pronounced a characteristic of  the German Reichstag in modern Berlin as it was in medieval Regensburg.  These conditions have induced me to publish now the following pages,  which were partly written some time ago.    Nobody can fail to see that we have reached a crisis in our national and  political development. At such times it is necessary to be absolutely  clear on three points: the goals to be aimed at, the difficulties to be  surmounted, and the sacrifices to be made.    The task I have set myself is to discuss these matters, stripped of all  diplomatic disguise, as clearly and convincingly as possible. It is  obvious that this can only be done by taking a national point of view.    Our science, our literature, and the warlike achievements of our past,  have made me proudly conscious of belonging to a great civilized nation  which, in spite of all the weakness and mistakes of bygone days, must,  and assuredly will, win a glorious future; and it is out of the fulness  of my German heart that I have recorded my convictions. I believe that  thus I shall most effectually rouse the national feeling in my readers'  hearts, and strengthen the national purpose.

Beholding them in their native haunts,  adorning the rugged cliffs, gracefully fringing the water-courses, or  waving their stately fronds on the borders of woodlands, he feels their  call to a closer acquaintance. Happy would he be to receive instruction  from a living teacher: His next preference would be the companionship of a  good fern book. Such a help we aim to give him in this manual. If he will  con it diligently, consulting its glossary for the meaning of terms while  he quickens his powers of observation by studying real specimens, he may  hope to learn the names and chief qualities of our most common ferns in a  single season.    Our most productive period in fern literature was between 1878, when  Williamson published his \"Ferns of Kentucky,\" and 1905, when Clute  issued, \"Our Ferns in Their Haunts.\" Between these flourished D.C. Eaton,  Davenport, Waters, Dodge, Parsons, Eastman, Underwood, A.A. Eaton, Slosson,  and others. All their works are now out of print except Clute's just  mentioned and Mrs. Parsons' \"How to Know the Ferns.\" Both of these  are valuable handbooks and amply illustrated. Clute's is larger, more  scholarly, and more inclusive of rare species, with an illustrated key to  the genera; while Mrs. Parsons' is more simple and popular, with a naive  charm that creates for it a constant demand.    We trust there is room also for this unpretentious, but progressive,  handbook, designed to stimulate interest in the ferns and to aid the  average student in learning their names and meaning. Its geographical  limits include the northeastern states and Canada. Its nomenclature follows  in the main the seventh edition of Gray's Manual, while the emendations  set forth in _Rhodora_, of October, 1919, and also a few terms of later  adoption are embodied, either as synonyms or substitutes for the more  familiar Latin names of the Manual, and are indicated by a different type.  In every case the student has before him both the older and the more recent  terms from which to choose. However, since the book is written primarily  for lovers of Nature, many of whom are unfamiliar with scientific terms,  the common English names are everywhere given prominence, and strange to  say are less subject to change and controversy than the Latin. There is  no doubt what species is meant when one speaks of the Christmas fern, the  ostrich fern, the long beech fern, the interrupted fern, etc. The use of  the common names will lead to the knowledge and enjoyment of the scientific  terms.
