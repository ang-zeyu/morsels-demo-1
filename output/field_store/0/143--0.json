TALBOT    PROFESSOR OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF  TECHNOLOGY    SIXTH EDITION, COMPLETELY REWRITTEN          PREFACE      This Introductory Course of Quantitative Analysis has been prepared  to meet the needs of students who are just entering upon the subject,  after a course of qualitative analysis. It is primarily intended to  enable the student to work successfully and intelligently without the  necessity for a larger measure of personal assistance and supervision  than can reasonably be given to each member of a large class. To this  end the directions are given in such detail that there is very little  opportunity for the student to go astray; but the manual is not, the  author believes, on this account less adapted for use with small  classes, where the instructor, by greater personal influence, can  stimulate independent thought on the part of the pupil.    The method of presentation of the subject is that suggested by  Professor A.A. Noyes' excellent manual of Qualitative Analysis. For  each analysis the procedure is given in considerable detail, and  this is accompanied by explanatory notes, which are believed to be  sufficiently expanded to enable the student to understand fully the  underlying reason for each step prescribed. The use of the book  should, nevertheless, be supplemented by classroom instruction, mainly  of the character of recitations, and the student should be taught to  consult larger works. The general directions are intended to emphasize  those matters upon which the beginner in quantitative analysis must  bestow special care, and to offer helpful suggestions. The student  can hardly be expected to appreciate the force of all the statements  contained in these directions, or, indeed, to retain them all in  the memory after a single reading; but the instructor, by frequent  reference to special paragraphs, as suitable occasion presents itself,  can soon render them familiar to the student.    The analyses selected for practice are those comprised in the first  course of quantitative analysis at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, and have been chosen, after an experience of years,  as affording the best preparation for more advanced work, and as  satisfactory types of gravimetric and volumetric methods. From the  latter point of view, they also seem to furnish the best insight into  quantitative analysis for those students who can devote but a limited  time to the subject, and who may never extend their study beyond the  field covered by this manual. The author has had opportunity to test  the efficiency of the course for use with such students, and has found  the results satisfactory.    In place of the usual custom of selecting simple salts as material for  preliminary practice, it has been found advantageous to substitute, in  most instances, approximately pure samples of appropriate minerals or  industrial products. The difficulties are not greatly enhanced, while  the student gains in practical experience.    The analytical procedures described in the following pages have been  selected chiefly with reference to their usefulness in teaching the  subject, and with the purpose of affording as wide a variety of  processes as is practicable within an introductory course of this  character. The scope of the manual precludes any extended attempt to  indicate alternative procedures, except through general references to  larger works on analytical chemistry. The author is indebted to the  standard works for many suggestions for which it is impracticable to  make specific acknowledgment; no considerable credit is claimed by him  for originality of procedure.    For many years, as a matter of convenience, the classes for which this  text was originally prepared were divided, one part beginning with  gravimetric processes and the other with volumetric analyses. After a  careful review of the experience thus gained the conclusion has been  reached that volumetric analysis offers the better approach to the  subject. Accordingly the arrangement of the present (the sixth)  edition of this manual has been changed to introduce volumetric  procedures first. Teachers who are familiar with earlier editions  will, however, find that the order of presentation of the material  under the various divisions is nearly the same as that previously  followed, and those who may still prefer to begin the course of  instruction with gravimetric processes will, it is believed, be able  to follow that order without difficulty.    Procedures for the determination of sulphur in insoluble sulphates,  for the determination of copper in copper ores by iodometric methods,  for the determination of iron by permanganate in hydrochloric acid  solutions, and for the standardization of potassium permanganate  solutions using sodium oxalate as a standard, and of thiosulphate  solutions using copper as a standard, have been added. The  determination of silica in silicates decomposable by acids, as a  separate procedure, has been omitted.    The explanatory notes have been rearranged to bring them into closer  association with the procedures to which they relate. The number of  problems has been considerably increased.    The author wishes to renew his expressions of appreciation of the  kindly reception accorded the earlier editions of this manual. He has  received helpful suggestions from so many of his colleagues within the  Institute, and friends elsewhere, that his sense of obligation must  be expressed to them collectively. He is under special obligations  to Professor L.F. Hamilton for assistance in the preparation of the  present edition.    HENRY P.

A preliminary qualitative examination is generally indispensable, if  intelligent and proper provisions are to be made for the separation of  the various constituents under such conditions as will insure accurate  quantitative estimations.    It is assumed that the operations of qualitative analysis are familiar  to the student, who will find that the reactions made use of in  quantitative processes are frequently the same as those employed in  qualitative analyses with respect to both precipitation and systematic  separation from interfering substances; but it should be noted that  the conditions must now be regulated with greater care, and in such  a manner as to insure the most complete separation possible. For  example, in the qualitative detection of sulphates by precipitation  as barium sulphate from acid solution it is not necessary, in most  instances, to take into account the solubility"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1279"],[0,"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns (#1)"],[1,"AND SONGS OF ROBERT BURNS      by Robert Burns                 Introductory Note         1771 - 1779         Song--Handsome Nell       Song--O Tibbie, I Hae Seen The Day       Song--I Dream'd I Lay       Song--I Dream'd I Lay       Song--In The Character Of A Ruined Farmer       Tragic Fragment--All villain as I am       The Tarbolton Lasses       Ah, Woe Is Me, My Mother Dear       Song--Montgomerie's Peggy       The Ploughman's Life         1780         The Ronalds Of The Bennals       Song--Here's To Thy Health       Song--The Lass Of Cessnock Banks       Song--Bonie Peggy Alison       Song--Mary Morison         1781         Winter: A Dirge       A Prayer, Under The Pressure Of Violent Anguish       Paraphrase Of The First Psalm       The First Six Verses Of The Ninetieth Psalm Versified       Prayer, In The Prospect Of Death       Stanzas, On The Same Occasion         1782       Fickle Fortune: A Fragment       Song--Raging Fortune--Fragment Of       I'll Go And Be A Sodger       Song--\"No Churchman Am I\"       My Father Was A Farmer       John Barleycorn: A Ballad         1783         Death And Dying Words Of Poor Mailie       Poor Mailie's Elegy       Song--The Rigs O' Barley       Song Composed In August       Song--My Nanie, O!
