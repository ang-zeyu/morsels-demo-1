In 1908 I read in the British Museum  many newspapers and journals for the years 1860-1865, and then planned a  survey of English public opinion on the American Civil War. In the  succeeding years as a teacher at Stanford University, California, the  published diplomatic correspondence of Great Britain and of the United  States were studied in connection with instruction given in the field of  British-American relations. Several of my students prepared excellent  theses on special topics and these have been acknowledged where used in  this work. Many distractions and other writing prevented the completion  of my original plan; and fortunately, for when in 1913 I had at last  begun this work and had prepared three chapters, a letter was received  from the late Charles Francis Adams inviting me to collaborate with him  in preparing a \"Life\" of his father, the Charles Francis Adams who was  American Minister to Great Britain during the Civil War. Mr. Adams had  recently returned from England where he had given at Oxford University a  series of lectures on the Civil War and had been so fortunate as to  obtain copies, made under the scholarly supervision of Mr. Worthington  C. Ford, of a great mass of correspondence from the Foreign Office files  in the Public Record Office and from the private papers in the  possession of various families.    The first half of the year 1914 was spent with Mr. Adams at Washington  and at South Lincoln, in preparing the \"Life.\" Two volumes were  completed, the first by Mr. Adams carrying the story to 1848, the  second by myself for the period 1848 to 1860. For the third volume I  analysed and organized the new materials obtained in England and we were  about to begin actual collaboration on the most vital period of the  \"Life\" when Mr. Adams died, and the work was indefinitely suspended,  probably wisely, since any completion of the \"Life\" by me would have  lacked that individual charm in historical writing so markedly  characteristic of all that Mr. Adams did. The half-year spent with Mr.  Adams was an inspiration and constitutes a precious memory.    The Great War interrupted my own historical work, but in 1920 I returned  to the original plan of a work on \"Great Britain and the American Civil  War\" in the hope that the English materials obtained by Mr. Adams might  be made available to me. When copies were secured by Mr. Adams in 1913 a  restriction had been imposed by the Foreign Office to the effect that  while studied for information, citations and quotations were not  permissible since the general diplomatic archives were not yet open to  students beyond the year 1859. Through my friend Sir Charles Lucas, the  whole matter was again presented to the Foreign Office, with an exact  statement that the new request was in no way related to the proposed  \"Life\" of Charles Francis Adams, but was for my own use of the  materials. Lord Curzon, then Foreign Secretary, graciously approved the  request but with the usual condition that my manuscript be submitted  before publication to the Foreign Office. This has now been done, and no  single citation censored. Before this work will have appeared the  limitation hitherto imposed on diplomatic correspondence will have been  removed, and the date for open research have been advanced beyond 1865,  the end of the Civil War.    Similar explanations of my purpose and proposed work were made through  my friend Mr. Francis W. Hirst to the owners of various private papers,  and prompt approval given. In 1924 I came to England for further study  of some of these private papers. The Russell Papers, transmitted to the  Public Record Office in 1914 and there preserved, were used through the  courtesy of the Executors of the late Hon. Rollo Russell, and with the  hearty goodwill of Lady Agatha Russell, daughter of the late Earl  Russell, the only living representative of her father, Mr. Rollo  Russell, his son, having died in 1914. The Lyons Papers, preserved in  the Muniment Room at Old Norfolk House, were used through the courtesy  of the Duchess of Norfolk, who now represents her son who is a minor.  The Gladstone Papers, preserved at Hawarden Castle, were used through  the courtesy of the Gladstone Trustees. The few citations from the  Palmerston Papers, preserved at Broadlands, were approved by  Lieut.-Colonel Wilfred Ashley, M.P.    The opportunity to study these private papers has been invaluable for my  work. Shortly after returning from England in 1913 Mr. Worthington Ford  well said: \"The inside history of diplomatic relations between the  United States and Great Britain may be surmised from the official  archives; the tinting and shading needed to complete the picture must be  sought elsewhere.\" (Mass. Hist. Soc. _Proceedings_, XLVI, p. 478.) Mr.  C.F. Adams declared (_ibid._, XLVII, p. 54) that without these papers  \"... the character of English diplomacy at that time (1860-1865) cannot  be understood.... It would appear that the commonly entertained  impressions as to certain phases of international relations, and the  proceedings and utterances of English public men during the progress of  the War of Secession, must be to some extent revised.\"    In addition to the new English materials I have been fortunate in the  generosity of my colleague at Stanford University, Professor Frank A.  Golder, who has given to me transcripts, obtained at St. Petersburg in  1914, of all Russian diplomatic correspondence on the Civil War. Many  friends have aided, by suggestion or by permitting the use of notes and  manuscripts, in the preparation of this work. I have sought to make due  acknowledgment for such aid in my foot-notes. But in addition to those  already named, I should here particularly note the courtesy of the late  Mr. Gaillard Hunt for facilities given in the State Department at  Washington, of Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, for the  transcript of the Correspondence of Mason and Slidell, Confederate  Commissioners in Europe, and of Mr. Charles Moore, Chief of Manuscripts  Division, Library of Congress, for the use of the Schurz Papers  containing copies of the despatches of Schleiden, Minister of the  Republic of Bremen at Washington during the Civil War. Especially thanks  are due to my friend, Mr. Herbert Hoover, for his early interest in this  work and for his generous aid in the making of transcripts which would  otherwise have been beyond my means. And, finally, I owe much to the  skill and care of my wife who made the entire typescript for the Press,  and whose criticisms were invaluable.    It is no purpose of a Preface to indicate results, but it is my hope  that with, I trust, a \"calm comparison of the evidence,\" now for the  first time available to the historian, a fairly true estimate may be  made of what the American Civil War meant to Great Britain; how she  regarded it and how she reacted to it. In brief, my work is primarily a  study in British history in the belief that the American drama had a  world significance, and peculiarly a British one.

The historian, George Grote, could write: \"The  perfect neutrality [of Great Britain] in this destructive war appears to  me almost a phenomenon in political history.

The age is now at hand that shall harness the energies of mind,  new-found in the psychological laboratory, and shall put them at the  service of humanity.    Are you fully equipped to take a valiant part in the work of the coming  years?    [Sidenote: The Dollars and Cents of Mental Waste]    The greatest of all eras is at hand! Are you increasing your fitness to  appreciate it and take part in it, or are you merely passing your time  away?    Take careful note for a week of the incidents of your daily life--your  methods of work, habits of thought, modes of recreation. You will  discover an appalling waste in your present random methods of operation.    How many foot-pounds of energy do you suppose you annually dump into the  scrap-heap of wasted effort? What does this mean to you in dollars and  cents? In conscious usefulness? In peace and happiness?    [Sidenote: The Means to Notable Achievement]    Individual mental efficiency is an absolute prerequisite to any notable  personal achievement or any great individual success. Your mental  energies are the forces with which you must wage your battles in this  world. Are you prepared to direct and deploy _Achievement__ these forces  with masterful control and strategic skill? Are you prepared to use all  your reserves of mental energy in the crises of your career?    A Mighty and Intelligent Power resides within you. Its marvelous  resources are just now coming to be recognized.    Recent scientific research has revealed, beyond the world of the senses  and beyond the domain of consciousness, a wide and hitherto hidden realm  of human energies and resources.    [Sidenote: A Process for \"Making Good\"]    These are mental energies and resources. They are phases of the mind,  not of the \"mind\" of fifty years ago, but of a \"mind\" of whose  operations you are unconscious and whose marvelous breadth and depth and  power have but recently been revealed to the world by scientific  experiment.    In this _Basic Course of Reading_ we shall lay before you in simple and  clear-cut but scientific form the proof that you have at your command  mental powers of which you have never before dreamed.    And we shall give you such specific directions for the use of these  new-found powers, that whatever your environment, whatever your  business, whatever your ambition, _you need but follow our plain and  simple instructions in order to do the thing you want to do, to be the  man you want to be, or to get the thing you want to have._    [Sidenote: Inadequacy of Body Training]    If you have any thought that the control of your hidden mental energies  is to be acquired by mere hygienic measures, put it from you. The idea  that you may come into the fulness of your powers through mere  wholesome living, outdoor sports and bodily exercise is an idea that  belongs to an age that is past. Good health is not necessary to  achievement. It is not even a positive influence for achievement. It is  merely a negative blessing. With good health you may hope to reach your  highest mental and spiritual development free from the harassment of  soul-racking pain. But without good health men have reached the summit  of Parnassus and have dragged their tortured bodies up behind them.    [Sidenote: Inadequacy of Business Specialization]    Nor does success necessarily follow or require long preparation in a  particular field. The first occupation of the successful man is rarely  the one in which he achieves his ultimate triumph. In the changing  conditions of our day, one needs a better weapon than the mere knowledge  of a particular trade, vocation or profession. _He needs that mastery of  himself and others that is the fundamental secret of success in all  fields of endeavor_.    [Sidenote: Futility of Advice in Business]    It is well to tell you beforehand that in this _Basic Course of Reading_  we shall be content with no mere cataloguing of the factors that are  commonly regarded as essential to success. We shall do no moralizing.  You will find here no elaboration of the ancient aphorisms, \"Honesty is  the best policy,\" and \"Genius is the infinite capacity for taking  pains.\"    The world has had its fill of mere exhortations to industry, frugality  and perseverance. For some thousands of years men have preached to the  lazy man, \"Be industrious,\" and to the timid man, \"Be bold.\" But such  phrases never have solved and never can solve the problem for the man  who feels himself lacking in both industry and courage.    [Sidenote: The Why and the How]    It is easy enough to tell the salesman that he must approach his  \"prospect\" with tact and confidence. But tact and confidence are not  qualities that can be assumed and discarded like a Sunday coat. Industry  and courage and tact and confidence are well enough, but we must know  the Why and the How of these things.    It is well enough to preach that the secret of achievement is to be  found in \"courage-faith\" and \"courage-confidence,\" and that the way to  acquire these qualities is to assume that you have them. There is no  denying the undoubted fact that men and women have been rescued from the  deepest mire of poverty and despair and "]]]
