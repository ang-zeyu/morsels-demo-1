[Illustration: Old Covent Garden. ]    The notoriety of Covent Garden is of too multifarious a description to  render the above illustration uninteresting to either of our readers. It  is copied from one of Hollar's prints, and represents the Garden about  the time of Charles II., before its area had been polluted with filth  and vegetable odours.    The spot was originally the garden belonging to the abbot of  Westminster, which extended to St. Martin's church, was called the  _Convent Garden_, and may be distinctly traced in Ralph Agar's View of  London, bearing date about 1570. It was granted, after the dissolution,  by Edward VI. first to the protector Somerset, on whose attainder, in  1582, it passed into the Bedford family. About the year 1634, Francis,  Earl of Bedford, began to clear away the old buildings, and to form the  present handsome square. Its execution was confided to Inigo Jones, but  unfortunately, only the north, and part of the east side, was completed;  for, had the piazza been continued on the other this would have been one  of the noblest quadrangles in the metropolis. Previously to the erection  of the present mass of huts and sheds, the area was neatly gravelled,  had a handsome dial in the centre, and was railed in on all sides, at  the distance of sixty feet from the buildings. The south side was  bounded by the garden wall of Bedford-House, the town house of the noble  family of that name; and along this wall only were the market booths.  But the mansion has long given way to Little Bedford-street.    The most striking object in the engraving is, however, the original  church of St. Paul, as built by Inigo Jones, connected with which is the  following anecdote:--When the Earl of Bedford sent for Jones, in 1640,  he told him he wanted a chapel for the parishioners of Covent Garden;  but added, he would not go to any considerable expense. \"In short,\" said  he, \"I would not have it much better than a barn.\"--\"Well, then,\"  replied Jones, \"you shall have the handsomest barn in England.\" The  ceiling was very beautifully painted by Edward Pierce, sen. a pupil of  Vandyke. In 1795, the church was accidentally destroyed by fire, but it  was rebuilt by Mr. Hardwick, in imitation of the original design.    In a note at page 236 of vol. x. of the MIRROR, we adverted to the  disgraceful state of Covent Garden Market, which of late years has been  little better than a public nuisance. The broom of reform at length  promises to cleanse this _Augean_ area; and a new market is in the  course of erection. The design, it will be recollected, was in this  year's Exhibition at Somerset House, and in an early Number we may  probably give a view of the Elevation.    The celebrity of Covent Garden as a depot for vegetable produce is of  considerable antiquity; and it is but reasonable that such an  improvement should be made, consistent with the increased and increasing  wants of this overgrown metropolis, and the augmented supplies which are  poured in from all quarters. When this improvement is completed, it may  lead to the finishing of the quadrangle. The parish (in extent, not in  feeling) is, perhaps, one of the most compact in London; but when its  proximity to the theatres is considered, little surprise can reasonably  be felt at the immorality of the district. It may not be so easy a  matter to mend the public morals as to build new markets; but the links  of popular improvement are too closely connected to make the case  hopeless.    It would be amusing to compare this emporium of fruits and vegetables in  ancient and modern times. At the first enclosure of Covent Garden, in  1635, the supply must have been very scanty. Upon the authority of Hume,  we learn that when Catherine, queen of Henry VIII., was in want of any  salads, carrots, or other edible roots, &c. she was obliged to send a  special messenger to Holland for them. But the mention of water-cresses,  kales, gooseberries, currants, &c., by old writers, appears to  invalidate the pursy historian. The garden must, nevertheless, have  presented a very different appearance to that of our day. Only let the  _gourmand_ take a walk through the avenues of the present Covent  Garden--from the imperial pine, to the emerald leaves sprinkled with  powdered diamonds--_vulgo_, savoys. Then the luscious list of autumnal  fruits, and the peppers, or capsicums, and tomatas, to tickle the  appetite of the veriest epicure of east or western London--not to  mention the exotic fragrance of oranges, which come in just opportunely  to fill up the chasm in the supply of British fruits.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT ROMAN FESTIVALS    DECEMBER.    (_For the Mirror._)      The feasts of _Opalia_ were celebrated in honour of the goddess _Ops_;  they were held on the 9th of December. Saturn and Ops were husband and  wife, and to them we owe the introduction of corn and fruits; for which  reason the feast was not held till the harvest and fruit time were over.  The vows offered to this goddess were made sitting on the ground, to  show that she was Earth, the mother of all things.    The _Saturnalia_ were festivals in honour of Saturn, celebrated the 16th  or 17th, or, according to others, the 18th of December. They were  instituted long before the foundation of Rome, in commemoration of the  freedom and equality which prevailed on earth in the golden reign of  Saturn. Some, however, suppose that the Saturnalia were first observed  at Rome in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, after a victory obtained over  the Sabines; while others support, that Janus first instituted them in  gratitude to Saturn, from whom he had learnt agriculture; others suppose  that they were first celebrated in the year of Rome 257, after a victory  obtained over the Latins by the dictator, Posthumius. The Saturnalia  were originally celebrated only for one day, but afterwards the  solemnity continued for three, four, five, and at last for seven days.  The celebration was remarkable for the license which universally  prevailed. The slaves were permitted to ridicule their masters, and to  speak with freedom upon any subject. It was usual for friends to make  presents one to another; all animosity ceased; no criminals were  executed; schools were shut; war was never declared, but all was mirth,  riot, and debauchery. In the sacrifices the priests made their offerings  with their heads uncovered,--a custom which was never observed at other  festivals.    The _Divalia_ was a feast held on the 2lst of December, in honour of the  goddess _Angerona_, whence it is also called Angeronalia. On the day of  this festival the pontifices performed sacrifices in the temple of  Voluptia, or the goddess of joy and pleasure, who, some say, was the  same with _Angerona_, and supposed to drive away all the sorrow and  chagrin of life.    The feast of _Laurentinalia_ was held on the 23rd of December, but was  ordered to be observed twice a year by Augustus; by some supposed to be  in honour of the _Lares_, a kind of domestic genii, or divinities,  worshipped in houses, and esteemed the guardians and protectors of  families, supposed to reside in chimney-corners. Others have attributed  this feast in honour of Acca Laurentia, the nurse of Romulus and Remus,  and wife of Faustulus.

(_For the Mirror._)      _Hibernia_.--Ireland is called by the Latin writers, _Hibernia,  Ivernia--Ierne_[1]--and _Verna_--names differing but little in sound,  and all, merely Latinizations of the Irish words _Ibh Eirin_--that is,  the Land of Erie--for _Ibh_, in Irish, signifies a land, or country, and  _Eirin_ is the genitive case of _Eire_, the name of Ireland in the Irish  tongue--from _Ibh Eirin_ the Romans formed Hibernia, &c. the termination  only being Latin--and from _Eire_, by adding _land_, the Saxons formed  _Eireland_ or _Ireland_. This Eire was a very ancient queen who gave her  name to the country, as in modern times _Virginia_ was called after  Queen Elizabeth, _Maryland_ after the queen of Charles I., &c.        [1] Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis _Ierne_. CLAUDIAN.    _Tory_.--A robber, an outlaw, literally, _one hunted_--a name originally  given to the outlawed Irish chiefs of Ulster, in the reign of James I.,  who after the seizure of their lands, had a price set upon their heads,  and were _hunted_ by the soldiery like wild beasts; hence the name of  _Tories_, meaning the _hunted_ people, for _Toriacht_ in Irish signifies  a pursuit or hunting, and _Torihe_, hunted. In the reign of Charles II.  it began to be used to designate a party in the state favourable to  absolute monarchy; many of these \"Tories\" having followed the fortunes  of that prince in exile, returned with him, and being his most devoted  partisans when reseated on his throne.    _Admiral_.--This word, which appears to have sadly puzzled the  etymologists, having been derived from the Phoenician, the Coptic, and  half a dozen languages besides, is pure Celtic, but little altered too,  in its transit from one language to another. _Ard_, high or chief,  _Muir_, the sea, and _Fear_, (in composition pronounced _ar_) a man, so  that _Ardmurar_, or _Admiral_, signifies literally the _Chief Seaman_.  There is nothing of torture in this derivation, as may be seen by  referring to any Irish dictionary, and it is a curious fact, that the  Irish seamen in the navy very generally call the Admiral \"_the  Ardmurar_.\" In Irish it is frequently written in two words, thus--_Ard  muirfhear_.    _Beltin day_.--The first of May is so called in many places in the North  of England. It was a custom in the days of Druidism to light large fires  on the tops of hills on the evening of the first of May, in honour of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#1)"],[1,"THE CLAWS OF THE GERMAN EAGLE    ALBERT RHYS WILLIAMS              ACKNOWLEDGMENT    My thanks go to the Editors of The Outlook for permission to  reproduce the articles which first appeared in that magazine.

Unspeakable atrocities! Men blood-lusting like a lot  of tigers!    Horrible they are indeed. But my experiences in the war zone  render them no longer incomprehensible. For, while over there, in  my own blood I felt the same raging beasts. Over there, in my own  soul I knew the shattering of my most cherished principles.    It is not an unique experience. Whoever has been drawn into the  center of the conflict has found himself swept by passions of  whose presence and power he had never dreamed.    For example: I was a pacifist bred in the bone. Yet, caught in Paris  at the outbreak of the war, my convictions underwent a rapid  crumbling before the rising tide of French national feeling. The  American Legion exercised a growing fascination over me. A little  longer, and I might have been marching out to the music of the  Marseillaise, dedicated to the killing of the Germans. Two weeks  later I fell under the spell of the self-same Germans. That long gray  column swinging on through Liege so mesmerized me that my  natural revulsion against slaughter was changed to actual  admiration.    Had an officer right then thrust a musket into my hand, I could  have mechanically fallen into step and fared forth to the killing of  the French. Such an experience makes one chary about dispensing  counsels of perfection to those fighting in the vortex of the world-storm.  Whenever I begin to get shocked at the black crimes of the belligerents,  my own collapse lies there to accuse me.    It is in the spirit of a non-partisan, then, that this chronicle of  adventure in those crucial days of the early war is written. It is a  welter of experiences and reactions which the future may use as  another first-hand document in casting up its own conclusions.  There is no careful culling out of just those episodes which support  a particular theory, such as the total and complete depravity of the  German race.    Despite my British ancestry, the record tries to be impartial--  without pro- or anti-German squint. If the reader had been in my  skin, zigzagging his way through five different armies, the things  which I saw are precisely the ones which he would have seen. So I  am not to blame whether these episodes damn the Germans or  bless them. Some do, and some don't. What one ran into was  largely a matter of luck.    For example: In Brussels on September 27, 1914, I fell in with a  lieutenant of the British army. With an American passport he had  made his way into the city through the German lines. We both  desired to see Louvain, but all passage thereto was for the  moment forbidden. Starting out on the main road, however, sentry  after sentry passed us along until we were halted near staff  headquarters, a few miles out of the city, and taken before the  commandant. We informed him of our overweening desire to view  the ruins of Louvain. He explained, as sarcastically as he could,  that war was not a social diversion, and bade us make a quick  return to Brussels, swerving neither to the right nor left as we went.    As we were plodding wearily back, temptation suddenly loomed up  on our right in the shape of a great gas-bag which we at first took  to be a Zeppelin. It proved to be a stationary balloon which was  acting as the eye of the artillery. It was signaling the range to the  German gunners beneath, who were pounding away at the Belgians.  In our excitement over the spectacle, we went plunging across fields  until we gained a good view of the great swaying thing, tugging away  at the slender filament of rope which bound it to the earth.    Sinking down into the grass, we were so intent upon the sharp  electric signaling as to be oblivious to aught else, until a voice rang  a harsh challenge from behind. Jumping to our feet, we faced a  squad of German soldiers and an officer who said:    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"Came out to see the big balloon,\" we somewhat naively informed  him.    \"Very good!\" he said. And then, quite as if he were rewarding our  manifest zeal for exploration, he added, \"Come along with me and  you can see the big commandant, too.\"    Three soldiers ahead and three behind, we were escorted down  the railroad track in silence until we began to pass some cars filled  with the recently wounded in a fearfully shot-to-pieces state. Some  one mumbled \"Englishmen!\" and the whole crowd, bandaged and  bleeding as they were, rose to the occasion and greeted us with  derisive shouts.    \"Put the blackguards to work,\" growled one.    \"No! Kill the damn spies!\" shouted another, as he pulled himself  out of the straw, \"kill them!\"    A huge fellow almost wild from his wounds bellowed out: \"Why  don't you stick your bayonet into the cursed Englishmen?\" No  doubt it would have eased his pain a bit to see us getting a taste of  the same thing he was suffering.    Our officer, as if to make concessions to this hue and cry, growled  harshly: \"Don't look around! Damn you! and take your hands out of  your pockets!\"    We heaved sighs of relief as we left this place of pain and hate  behind. But a new terror took hold of us as a turn in the track  brought our destination into view. It was the staff headquarters in  which, two hours before, the commandant had ordered us to make  direct return to Brussels.    \"Wait here,\" said the officer as he walked inside.    We stood there trying to appear unconcerned while we cursed the  exploring bent in our constitutions, and mentally composed  farewell letters to the folks at home.    But luck does sometimes light upon the banners of the daring. It  seems that in the two hours since we had left headquarters a  complete change had been made in the staff. At any rate, an  officer whom we had not seen before came out and addressed us  in English. We told him that we were Americans.    \"Well, let's see what you know about New York,\" he said.    We displayed an intensive knowledge of Coney Island and the  Great White Way, which he deemed satisfactory.    \"Nothing like them in Europe!\" he assured us. \"I did enjoy those  ten years in America. I would do anything I could for one of you  fellows.\"    He backed this up by straightway ordering our release, and  authenticated his claim to American residence by his last shot:    \"Now boys, beat it back to Brussels.\"    We stood not on the order of our beating, but beat at once.    One may pick out of such an experience precisely what one  wishes to pick out: the imbecile hatred in the Teuton--the perfidy of  the British--the efficiency or the blundering of the German--or  perchance the foolhardiness of the American, just as his  nationalistic bias leads him.    So, from the narratives in this book, one may select just the  material which supports his theory as to the merits or demerits of  any nation. To myself, out of these insights into the Great  Calamity, there has come re-enforcement to my belief in the  essential greatness of the human stuff in all nations. Along with  this goes a faith that in the New Internationalism mankind will lay  low the military Frankenstein that he has created, and realize the  triumphant brotherhood of all human souls.            Part I  The Spy-Hunters Of Belgium          Chapter I    A Little German Surprise Party        \"Two days and the French will be here! Three days at the outside,  and not an ugly Boche left. Just mark my word!\"    This the patriarchal gentleman in the Hotel Metropole whispered to  me about a month after the Germans had captured Brussels. They  had taken away his responsibilities as President of the Belgian  Red Cross, so that now he had naught to do but to sit upon the  lobby divan, of which he covered much, being of extensive girth.  But no more extensive than his heart, from which radiated a genial  glow of benevolence to all--all except the invaders, the sight or  mention of whom put harshness in his face and anger in his voice.    \"Scabbard-rattler!\" he mumbled derisively, as an officer  approached. \"Clicks his spurs to get attention! Wants you to look  at him. Don't you do it. I never do.\" He closed his eyes tightly, as if  in sleep.    Oftentimes he did not need to feign his slumber. But sinking slowly  down into unconsciousness his native gentleness would return  and a smile would rest upon his lips; I doubt not that in his dreams  the Green-Gray troops of Despotism were ridden down by the Blue  and Red Republicans of France.    Once even he hummed a snatch of the Marseillaise. An extra loud  blast from the distant cannonading stirred him from his reverie. \"Ah  ha!\" he exclaimed, clasping my arm, the artillery--\"it's getting nearer  all the time. They are driving back the Boches, eh? We'll be free  to-morrow, certain. Then we'll celebrate together in my"]]]
