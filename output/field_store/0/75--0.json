BY  DANIEL DEFOE.    AND    _Two Letters from the_ \"_Journey through England by a Gentleman_.\"    CASSELL & COMPANY, LIMITED:  LONDON, PARIS, NEW YORK & MELBOURNE.  1888.          INTRODUCTION.      At the end of this book there are a couple of letters from a volume of  the \"Travels in England\" which were not by Defoe, although resembling  Defoe's work so much in form and title, and so near to it in date of  publication, that a volume of one book is often found taking the place of  a volume of the other.  A purchaser of Defoe's \"Travels in England\" has  therefore to take care that he is not buying one of the mixed sets.  Each  of the two works describes England at the end of the first quarter of the  eighteenth century.  Our added descriptions of Bath, and of the journey  by Chester to Holyhead, were published in 1722; Defoe's \"Journey from  London to the Land's End\" was published in 1724, and both writers help us  to compare the past with the present by their accounts of England as it  was in the days of George the First, more than a hundred and sixty years  ago.  The days certainly are gone when, after a good haul of pilchards,  seventeen can be bought for a halfpenny, and two gentlemen and their  servant can have them broiled at a tavern and dine on them for three  farthings, dressing and all.  In another of his journeys Defoe gives a  seaside tavern bill, in which the charges were ridiculously small for  everything except for bread.  It was war time, and the bread was the most  costly item in the bill.    In the earlier part of this account of the \"Journey from London to the  Land's End,\" there is interest in the fresh memories of the rebuilding  and planting at Hampton Court by William III. and Queen Mary.  The  passing away, and in opinion of that day the surpassing, of Wolsey's  palace there were none then to regret.    A more characteristic feature in this letter will be found in the details  of a project which Defoe says he had himself advocated before the Lord-  Treasurer Godolphin, for the settlement of poor refugees from the  Palatinate upon land in the New Forest.  Our friendly relations with the  Palatinate had begun with the marriage of James the First's eldest  daughter to the Elector Palatine, who brought on himself much trouble by  accepting the crown of Bohemia from the subjects of the Emperor Ferdinand  the Second.  As a Protestant Prince allied by marriage to England, he  drew from England sympathies and ineffectual assistance.  Many years  afterwards, during the war with France in Queen Anne's time, the allies  were unprosperous in 1707, and Marshal Villars was victorious upon the  Rhine.  The pressure of public feeling on behalf of refugees from the  Palatinate did not last long enough for any action to be taken.  But if  it had seemed well to the Government to accept the project advocated by  Defoe, we should have had a clearance of what is now the most beautiful  part of the New Forest, near Lyndhurst; and in place of the little area  that still preserves all the best features of forest land, we should have  had a town of Englishmen descended from the latest of the German  settlements upon our soil.  Upon the political economy of Defoe's  project, and the accuracy of his calculations, and the more or less  resemblance of his scheme to the system of free grants of land in  unsettled regions beyond the sea, each reader will speculate in his own  way.    There are interesting notes on the extent of the sheep farming upon the  Downs crossed in this journey.  There is high praise of the ladies of  Dorsetshire.  There are some pleasant notes upon dialect, including the  story, often quoted, of the schoolboy whom Defoe saw and heard reading  his Bible in class, and while following every word and line with his eye,  translating it as he went into his own way of speech.  Thus he turned the  third verse of the fifth chapter of Solomon's Song, \"I have put off my  coat; how shall I put it on?  I have washed my feet; how shall I defile  them?\" into \"Chav a doffed my cooat; how shall I don't?  Chav a washed my  veet; how shall I moil 'em?\"  This is a good example of intelligent  reading; for the boy took in the sense of the printed lines, and then  made it his own by giving homely utterance to what he understood.    Defoe tells in this letter several tales of the shorefolk about the Great  Storm of November, 1703, recollection of which Addison used effectively  in the following year in his poem on the Battle of Blenheim.  There was  the sweeping away of the first Eddystone Lighthouse, with the builder,  confident in its strength, who had desired to be in it some night when  the wind blew with unusual fury.  There was the story also of the man and  two boys, in a ship laden with tin, blown out of Helford Haven, and of  their hairbreadth escape by counsel of one of the boys who ran the ship  through rocks into a narrow creek that he knew in the Isle of Wight.  The  form of the coast has been changed so much since 1703 by the beat of many  storms, that it may be now impossible to know that little cove as the boy  knew it.  It must have been at the back of the island.  Were the storm  waves tossing then in Steephill Cove or Luccombe Chine?  Does there  survive anywhere a tradition of that perilous landing?  Probably not.  Wreck follows upon wreck, and memory of many tales of death and peril on  the rock-bound coast lie between us and the boy who took the helm when he  spied the well-known creek as the great storm was sweeping the ship on to  destruction.  From the next year after that famous storm, Defoe gives a  memory of disaster seen by himself at Plymouth in the wreck of a little  fleet from Barbadoes.  In another part of this letter he tells what he  had seen of a fight at sea between three French men-of-war and two  English with a convoy of two or three trading vessels.    There will be found also in this letter a good story of a Cornish dog  taken from Carew's \"Survey of Cornwall,\" which may pair with that of the  London dog who lately took a wounded fellow dog to hospital.    The writer of this letter speaks of the civil war times as a friend of  monarchy, but when he tells of the landing of William III. at Torbay, he  suggests that the people had good reason for rejoicing, and throughout  the journey he takes note of a great inequality he finds in distribution  of the right of returning members to Parliament.  It is evident that he  could propound a project for a Reform Bill, though he is careful so to  describe England as to avoid giving offence to Englishmen of any party.  The possibility of some change for the better here and there presents  itself; Defoe glances and passes on.  His theme is England and the  English; he shows us, clearly and very simply, what he has seen of the  social life and manners of the people, of the features of the land  itself, and their relation to its industries; traces of the past, and  prospects of the future; shepherds, fishermen, merchants; catching of  salmon peel in mill-weirs, and catching of husbands at provincial  assemblies; with whatever else he found worth friendly observation.    H. M.          FROM LONDON TO LAND'S END      Sir,    I find so much left to speak of, and so many things to say in every part  of England, that my journey cannot be barren of intelligence which way  soever I turn; no, though I were to oblige myself to say nothing of  anything that had been spoken of before.    I intended once to have gone due west this journey; but then I should  have been obliged to crowd my observations so close (to bring Hampton  Court, Windsor, Blenheim, Oxford, the Bath and Bristol all into one  letter; all those remarkable places lying in a line, as it were, in one  point of the compass) as to have made my letter too long, or my  observations too light and superficial, as others have done before me.    This letter will divide the weighty task, and consequently make it sit  lighter on the memory, be pleasanter to the reader, and make my progress  the more regular: I shall therefore take in Hampton Court and Windsor in  this journey; the first at my setting out, and the last at my return, and  the rest as their situation demands.    As I came down from Kingston, in my last circuit, by the south bank of  the Thames, on the Surrey side of the river; so I go up to Hampton Court  now on the north bank, and on the Middlesex side, which I mention,  because, as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel,  so the beauty of the country, the pleasant situations, the glory of  innumerable fine buildings (noblemen's and gentlemen's houses, and  citizens' retreats), are so equal a match to what I had described on the  other side that one knows not which to give the preference to: but as I  must speak of them again, when I come to write of the county of  Middlesex, which I have now purposely omitted; so I pass them over here,  except the palace of Hampton only, which I mentioned in \"Middlesex,\" for  the reasons above.    Hampton Court lies on the north bank of the River Thames, about two small  miles from Kingston, and on the road from Staines to Kingston Bridge; so  that the road straightening the parks a little, they were obliged to part  the parks, and leave the Paddock and the great park part on the other  side the road--a testimony of that just regard that the kings of England  always had, and still have, to the common good, and to the service of the  country, that they would not interrupt the course of the road, or cause  the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the  markets and fairs, for any pleasure of their own whatsoever.    The palace of Hampton Court was first founded and built from the ground  by that great statesman and favourite of King Henry VIII, Cardinal  Wolsey; and if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#1)"],[1,"the DP Team            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 601          NEW YORK, JULY 9, 1887    Scientific American Supplement.

Among the different classes of vessels designed for special services,  constructed by Messrs. Yarrow & Co., at Poplar, for the British  government, is one which is stated to be the fastest torpedo boat in her  majesty's navy. This boat has been put through its official trials; with  a load of 15 tons, running continuously for two hours without stopping,  a speed of 23 knots, which is equal to 261/2 statute miles, an hour was  obtained. The boat is 135 ft. long by 14 ft. beam. Its design is known  as the Falke type, being in many respects similar, but very superior, to  a torpedo boat of that name which was built two years ago by the same  firm for the Austrian government. The form of the hull is of such a  character as to give exceptional steering capabilities; at the time of  trial it was found to be able to steer round in a circle of a diameter  of 100 yards, averaging 62 seconds. The forward part of the boat is  completely covered over by a large turtle back, which is the customary  form of the boats built by Messrs. Yarrow & Co. It was first introduced  in the Batoum, which they constructed eight years ago for the Russian  government. This turtle back increases the seaworthiness of the craft by  throwing the water that comes upon it freely away. It forms, also, good  and roomy accommodation for the crew, and incloses a large portion of  the torpedo apparatus. The forward torpedo gear consists of one torpedo  gun, adapted for ejecting the Whitehead torpedo by means of gunpowder,  now preferred on account of its simplicity. The boiler, one of Messrs.  Yarrow & Co.'s special construction, of a type which has undergone many  years of constant trial, is capable of developing 1,660 horse power. In  the engine room there are six engines--one for driving the boat, two for  compressing the air for the torpedoes, an engine for working the dynamo  for producing the electric light, an engine for forcing air into the  stoke-hole, and an engine working in conjunction with the distilling  apparatus for supplying drinking water for the crew and the waste  incidental to the boiler. Aft of the engine room come the officers'  quarters. The stern of the boat is fitted up as a pantry and for the  stowage of ammunition and stores. On the deck are mounted three machine  guns, and near the stern an additional conning tower for use in case of  need, around which revolve two torpedo guns for firing the torpedoes off  either side. These torpedo guns can be trained to any angle it may be  desired to fire them at. On both conning towers are machine  guns.--_Illustrated London News_.    [Illustration: THE \"FALKE\" TYPE TORPEDO BOAT, AND SECTION SHOWING  GENERAL ARRANGEMENT.]           *       *       *       *       *          THE GERMAN NAVY--THE NEW GUNBOAT EBER.      The gunboat Eber is an improved vessel of the Wolf type, but differs  from other vessels of its class in that it has not a complete iron hull,  only the frame and deck beams being of iron, while the planking is of  wood and yellow metal. No copper is used on the bottom. The \"composite  system\" of building is looked upon with favor for ships of this kind,  because iron vessels which are kept permanently at stations in the  tropics soon become overgrown in spite of good care, and thus suffer a  great loss of speed. In a wooden vessel the crew's quarters are better  and more healthful than in iron vessels, for they are not as much  affected by the temperature outside of the ship.    The greatest length of the Eber is about 245 ft.; its breadth, 26 ft.;  its depth, 14 ft.; and it has a displacement of about 500 tons. The  armament will consist of three long 5 in. guns in center pivot  carriages, and a small number of revolvers. One of the former will be  placed at the stern on the quarter deck, and the two others on the  forecastle. Some of the revolvers will be on the quarter deck and some  on the forecastle, care being taken to arrange the guns so as to obtain  the widest possible range, thus enabling the ship to protect itself  perfectly.    [Illustration: THE NEW GERMAN GUNBOAT EBER.]    The Eber is provided with a two-cylinder, compound engine, which can  generate 650 horse power, giving the vessel a speed of 111/2 knots. The  coal bunkers are so large that the ship can travel 3,000 miles at a  speed slightly less than that just mentioned without requiring a fresh  supply of coal. The rigging is the same as in iron vessels of the Wolf  class, and the sails are sufficiently large to allow the vessel to  proceed without steam. The ship will carry about 90 men, including  officers, crew, engineers, and firemen.    A sum of $145,000 was appropriated for the construction and equipment of  the Eber, which was begun at Kiel in the latter part of 1885, and was  launched February 15, 1887.--_Illustrirte Zeitung_.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW BRITISH TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS.      The torpedo experiments against the Resistance, which have been  suspended since November last, were resumed on June 9 at Portsmouth by  the officers of the Vernon. The injuries received by the ironclad in the  previous experiments having been repaired, so as to make the vessel  watertight, the old ship was towed up the harbor, and moored in Fareham  Creek. Our readers are aware that the Resistance is an obsolete ironclad  which has finished her career as a battle ship, and that nothing could  have converted her into a modern armorclad.    Although it was intended to render the experiments final and conclusive  as a practical demonstration under service conditions of the destructive  effects of the Whitehead torpedo when directed against a modern vessel  of war, the results still leave behind them much uncertainty. The  Resistance was built of iron, whereas battle ships are now exclusively  constructed of steel, and it would be perhaps hazardous to state that  the behavior of the two metals under a sudden and violent shock would be  exactly the same. The construction of the double bottom of the old ship  is also different. Since the last experiments were carried out against  her, however, measures have been taken to make her as far as possible  the counterpart, so far as under water arrangements and coal protection  are concerned, of a modern ship of war.    At the last attack, the Whitehead was directed against the after part of  the hull on the port side in wake of the boilers. During the present  series of experiments the old ship was assailed on the same side, but  directly amidships, in the neighborhood of the engine room. As no steam  was got up in the boilers, the effect of the jar upon the steam pipes,  glands, and feed connections remains a matter of speculation. So far as  the"]]]
