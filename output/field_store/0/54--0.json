There are few circumstances among those which make up the present  condition of human knowledge, more unlike what might have been expected,  or more significant of the backward state in which speculation on the  most important subjects still lingers, than the little progress which  has been made in the decision of the controversy respecting the  criterion of right and wrong. From the dawn of philosophy, the question  concerning the _summum bonum_, or, what is the same thing, concerning  the foundation of morality, has been accounted the main problem in  speculative thought, has occupied the most gifted intellects, and  divided them into sects and schools, carrying on a vigorous warfare  against one another. And after more than two thousand years the same  discussions continue, philosophers are still ranged under the same  contending banners, and neither thinkers nor mankind at large seem  nearer to being unanimous on the subject, than when the youth Socrates  listened to the old Protagoras, and asserted (if Plato's dialogue be  grounded on a real conversation) the theory of utilitarianism against  the popular morality of the so-called sophist.    It is true that similar confusion and uncertainty, and in some cases  similar discordance, exist respecting the first principles of all the  sciences, not excepting that which is deemed the most certain of them,  mathematics; without much impairing, generally indeed without impairing  at all, the trustworthiness of the conclusions of those sciences. An  apparent anomaly, the explanation of which is, that the detailed  doctrines of a science are not usually deduced from, nor depend for  their evidence upon, what are called its first principles. Were it not  so, there would be no science more precarious, or whose conclusions were  more insufficiently made out, than algebra; which derives none of its  certainty from what are commonly taught to learners as its elements,  since these, as laid down by some of its most eminent teachers, are as  full of fictions as English law, and of mysteries as theology. The  truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a  science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis, practised  on the elementary notions with which the science is conversant; and  their relation to the science is not that of foundations to an edifice,  but of roots to a tree, which may perform their office equally well  though they be never dug down to and exposed to light. But though in  science the particular truths precede the general theory, the contrary  might be expected to be the case with a practical art, such as morals or  legislation. All action is for the sake of some end, and rules of  action, it seems natural to suppose, must take their whole character  and colour from the end to which they are subservient. When we engage in  a pursuit, a clear and precise conception of what we are pursuing would  seem to be the first thing we need, instead of the last we are to look  forward to. A test of right and wrong must be the means, one would  think, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence of  having already ascertained it.    The difficulty is not avoided by having recourse to the popular theory  of a natural faculty, a sense or instinct, informing us of right and  wrong. For--besides that the existence of such a moral instinct is  itself one of the matters in dispute--those believers in it who have any  pretensions to philosophy, have been obliged to abandon the idea that it  discerns what is right or wrong in the particular case in hand, as our  other senses discern the sight or sound actually present. Our moral  faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to  the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of  moral judgments; it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive  faculty; and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality,  not for perception of it in the concrete. The intuitive, no less than  what may be termed the inductive, school of ethics, insists on the  necessity of general laws. They both agree that the morality of an  individual action is not a question of direct perception, but of the  application of a law to an individual case. They recognise also, to a  great extent, the same moral laws; but differ as to their evidence, and  the source from which they derive their authority. According to the one  opinion, the principles of morals are evident _a priori_, requiring  nothing to command assent, except that the meaning of the terms be  understood. According to the other doctrine, right and wrong, as well as  truth and falsehood, are questions of observation and experience. But  both hold equally that morality must be deduced from principles; and the  intuitive school affirm as strongly as the inductive, that there is a  science of morals. Yet they seldom attempt to make out a list of the _a  priori_ principles which are to serve as the premises of the science;  still more rarely do they make any effort to reduce those various  principles to one first principle, or common ground of obligation. They  either assume the ordinary precepts of morals as of _a priori_  authority, or they lay down as the common groundwork of those maxims,  some generality much less obviously authoritative than the maxims  themselves, and which has never succeeded in gaining popular acceptance.  Yet to support their pretensions there ought either to be some one  fundamental principle or law, at the root of all morality, or if there  be several, there should be a determinate order of precedence among  them; and the one principle, or the rule for deciding between the  various principles when they conflict, ought to be self-evident.    To inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been  mitigated in practice, or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind  have been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct  recognition of an ultimate standard, would imply a complete survey and  criticism of past and present ethical doctrine. It would, however, be  easy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs  have attained, has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard  not recognised. Although the non-existence of an acknowledged first  principle has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men's  actual sentiments, still, as men's sentiments, both of favour and of  aversion, are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects  of things upon their happiness, the principle of utility, or as Bentham  latterly called it, the greatest happiness principle, has had a large  share in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully  reject its authority. Nor is there any school of thought which refuses  to admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material  and even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals,  however unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of  morality, and the source of moral obligation. I might go much further,  and say that to all those _a priori_ moralists who deem it necessary to  argue at all, utilitarian arguments are indispensable. It is not my  present purpose to criticise these thinkers; but I cannot help  referring, for illustration, to a systematic treatise by one of the most  illustrious of them, the _Metaphysics of Ethics_, by Kant. This  remarkable man, whose system of thought will long remain one of the  landmarks in the history of philosophical speculation, does, in the  treatise in question, lay down an universal first principle as the  origin and ground of moral obligation; it is this:--'So act, that the  rule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all  rational beings.' But when he begins to deduce from this precept any of  the actual duties of morality, he fails, almost grotesquely, to show  that there would be any contradiction, any logical (not to say  physical) impossibility, in the adoption by all rational beings of the  most outrageously immoral rules of conduct. All he shows is that the  _consequences_ of their universal adoption would be such as no one would  choose to incur.    On the present occasion, I shall, without further discussion of the  other theories, attempt to contribute something towards the  understanding and appreciation of the Utilitarian or Happiness theory,  and towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It is evident that this  cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term.  Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever  can be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means to  something admitted to be good without proof. The medical art is proved  to be good, by its conducing to health; but how is it possible to prove  that health is good? The art of music is good, for the reason, among  others, that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give  that pleasure is good? If, then, it is asserted that there is a  comprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves  good, and that whatever else is good, is not so as an end, but as a  mean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of  what is commonly understood by proof. We are not, however, to infer that  its acceptance or rejection must depend on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11233"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[PRICE  2d.           *       *       *       *       *    MILAN CATHEDRAL    [Illustration: MILAN CATHEDRAL.]      \"Show the motley-minded gentleman in;\"--the old friend with a new  face, or, in plain words, THE MIRROR _in a new type_. Tasteful reader,  examine the symmetry, the sharp cut and finish of this our new fount of  type, and tell us whether it accords not with the beauty, pungency, and  polish of the notings and selections of this our first sheet. For some  days this type has been glittering in the printing-office boxes, like  nestling fire-flies, and these pages at first resembled so many pools or  tanks of molten metal, or the windows of a fine old mansion--Hatfield  House for instance,--lit up by the refulgent rays of a rising sun.  The sight \"inspires us, and fires us;\" and we count upon _new_ letter  bringing us _new_ friends, and thus commence our Fourteenth Volume  with _new_ hopes and invigorating prospects. But what subject can  be more appropriate for such a commencement, than so splendid a  triumph of art as    MILAN CATHEDRAL;    situate almost in the centre, and occupying part of the great square  of the city. It is of Gothic architecture, and its materials are white  marble. In magnitude this edifice yields to few in the universe.  Inferior only to the Vatican, it equals in length, and in breadth  surpasses, the cathedral of Florence and St. Paul's; in the interior  elevation it yields to both; in exterior it exceeds both; in fretwork,  carving, and statues, it goes beyond all churches in the world, St.  Peter's itself not excepted. Its double aisles, its clustered pillars,  its lofty arches; the lustre of its walls; its numberless niches all  filled with marble figures, give it an appearance novel even in Italy,  and singularly majestic. The admirer of English Gothic will observe  one peculiarity, which is, that in the cathedral of Milan there is no  screen, and that the chancel is entirely open, and separated from the  nave only by its elevation.    The pillars of the cathedral of Milan are more than ninety feet in  height, and about eight in diameter. The dimensions of the church  at large are as follow:--In length four hundred and ninety feet, in  breadth two hundred and ninety-eight, in interior elevation under the  dome two hundred and fifty-eight, and four hundred in exterior, that  is to the summit of the tower. The pavement is formed of marble of  different colours, disposed in various patterns and figures. The number  of niches is great, and every niche has its statue, which, with those  placed on the ballustrade of the roof, are reported to amount to more  than four thousand. Many among them are said to be of great merit. Over  the dome rises a tower or spire, or rather obelisk, for its singular  shape renders it difficult to ascertain its appellation, which, whatever  may be its intrinsic merit, adds little either to the beauty or to the  magnificence of the structure which it surmounts. This obelisk was  erected about the middle of the last century, contrary to the opinion  of the best architects. Though misplaced, its form is not in itself  inelegant, while its architecture and mechanism are extremely ingenious,  and deserve minute examination. In ascending the traveller will observe,  that the roof of the church is covered with blocks of marble, connected  together by a cement, that has not only its hardness and durability, but  its colour, so that the eye scarcely perceives the juncture, and the  whole roof appears one immense piece of white shining marble. The view  from the summit is extensive and even novel, as it includes not only the  city and the rich plain of Milan, intersected with rivers and canals,  covered with gardens, orchards, vineyards, and groves, and thickly  studded with villages and towns; but it extends to the grand frame of  this picture, and takes in the neighbouring Alps, forming a magnificent  semicircle and uniting their bleak ridges with the milder and more  distant Apennines.    The traveller, says Eustace, will regret as he descends, that instead of  heaping this useless and cumbersome quarry upon the dome, the trustees  of the edifice did not employ the money expended upon it in erecting a  front, (for that essential part is still wanting,) corresponding with  the style and stateliness of this superb temple. A front has indeed been  begun, but in a taste so dissimilar to that of the main building, and  made up of such a medley of Roman orders and Gothic decorations, that  the total suspension of such a work might be considered as an advantage,  if a more appropriate portal were to be erected in its place. But  unfortunately the funds destined for the completion and repair of this  cathedral are now swallowed up in the general confiscation. Had it been  finished, and the western front built in a style corresponding with the  other parts, the admirers of the Gothic style would have possessed one  specimen perfect in its kind, and accompanied with all the advantages  of the best materials, set off by a fine climate.    In materials, the cathedral of Milan surpasses all the churches of the  universe, the noblest of which are only lined and coated with marble,  while this is entirely built, paved, vaulted, and roofed with the same  substance, and that of the whitest and most resplendent kind. The most  remarkable object in the interior of this church is the subterranean  chapel, in which the body of St. Charles Borromeo reposes. It is  immediately under the dome, in form octangular, and lined with silver,  divided into panels representing the different actions of the life of  the saint. The body is in a shrine of rock crystal, on, or rather behind  the altar; it is stretched at full length, drest in pontifical robes,  with the crosier and mitre. The face is exposed, very improperly,  because much disfigured by decay, a deformity increased and rendered  more hideous by its contrast with the splendour of the vestments which  cover the body, and by the pale ghastly light that gleams from the  aperture above. The inscription over this chapel or mausoleum, was  dictated by St. Charles himself, and breathes that modesty and piety  which so peculiarly marked his character. It is as follows:      CAROLUS CARDINALIS    TITULI S. PRAXEDIS    ARCHIEP. MEDIOLAN.    FREQUENTIORIBUS    CLERI POPULIQ. AC    DEVOTI FAEMINEI SEXUS    PRECIBUS SE COMMENDATUM    CUPIENS HOC LOCO SIBI    MONUMENTUM VIVENS ELEGIT.      Of the statues crowded in and around this edifice many are esteemed, and  some admired. Of the latter, that of St. Bartholomew is the first; it  stands in the church, and represents the apostle as holding his own  skin, which had been drawn off like drapery over his shoulders. The play  of the muscles is represented with an accuracy, that rather disgusts and  terrifies than pleases the spectator.[1] The exterior of the chancel is  lined with marble divided into panels, each of which has its _basso  relievo_; the interior is wainscoted, and carved in a very masterly  style. The whole of the chancel was erected by St. Charles Borromeo.        [1] The following lines are inscribed on its pedestal, in Latin,          and in English:--              Lest at the sculptor doubtfully you guess,            'Tis Marc Agrati, not Praxiteles.            This statue is reckoned worth its weight in gold.      In describing this magnificent cathedral, we have availed ourselves of  abridging the description in Eustace's \"Classical Tour,\" a work of high  authority and sterling value on all subjects connected with the Fine  Arts.           *       *       *       *       *      RUSTIC AMUSEMENTS.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      Three years ago you gave a pleasing illustration of \"_the Amusements  of May_,\" and at the same time lamented the decrease of village  festivity and rural merriment, which in days langsyne cheered the honest  hearts and lightened the daily toil of our rustic ancestors. From the  sentiments you express on that occasion, I am led to fancy that it will  afford you pleasure to hear that the song, the dance, and innocent  revelry are not quite forgotten in some part of our land, and that the  sweet and smiling spring is not suffered to make his lovely appearance  without one welcome shout from the sons and daughters of our happy  island; and, therefore, I will recount to you (and by your permission  to the readers of the MIRROR) a village fete which I lately witnessed  and enjoyed. On the 9th inst. (Whit-Tuesday), after a few miles' walk,  I arrived in the village of Shillingston (_Dorsetshire_), whose  inhabitants annually dedicate this day to those pastimes which (as one  of your correspondents has observed) seem a sort of first offering to  gentle skies, and are consecrated by the smiles of the tender year.  Attracted by musical sounds, and following my ears instead of my nose,  I soon found my way to the vicarage-house, where the company were just  arriving in procession, preceded by a pink and white silken banner,  while a pipe and tabor regulated their march. Next after the music  were four men each bearing a large garland of flowers, and after them  followed the merry lads and smiling lasses in good order and arrayed  in their holiday kirtles. The vicar's house stands on a fine lawn  commanding a most enchanting view. On this verdant carpet, after a  promenade and general salute to their worthy pastor and his numerous  guests, dancing took place; for the time all distinctions were laid  aside, and the greatest gentry in the neighbourhood, taking the hand of  their more humble neighbours, led them through the mazy dance with a  feeling of kindness, friendship, and good humour such as I have seldom  witnessed. Two or three hours of as beautiful an evening as ever zephyr  kissed were thus spent, after which, drawing up "]]]
