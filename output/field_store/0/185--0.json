The Hurrying of Ludovic      Anne Shirley was curled up on the window-seat of Theodora Dix's  sitting-room one Saturday evening, looking dreamily afar at some fair  starland beyond the hills of sunset. Anne was visiting for a fortnight  of her vacation at Echo Lodge, where Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Irving were  spending the summer, and she often ran over to the old Dix homestead  to chat for awhile with Theodora. They had had their chat out, on this  particular evening, and Anne was giving herself over to the delight of  building an air-castle. She leaned her shapely head, with its braided  coronet of dark red hair, against the window-casing, and her gray eyes  were like the moonlight gleam of shadowy pools.    Then she saw Ludovic Speed coming down the lane. He was yet far from the  house, for the Dix lane was a long one, but Ludovic could be recognized  as far as he could be seen. No one else in Middle Grafton had such a  tall, gently-stooping, placidly-moving figure. In every kink and turn of  it there was an individuality all Ludovic's own.    Anne roused herself from her dreams, thinking it would only be tactful  to take her departure. Ludovic was courting Theodora. Everyone in  Grafton knew that, or, if anyone were in ignorance of the fact, it was  not because he had not had time to find out. Ludovic had been coming  down that lane to see Theodora, in the same ruminating, unhastening  fashion, for fifteen years!    When Anne, who was slim and girlish and romantic, rose to go, Theodora,  who was plump and middle-aged and practical, said, with a twinkle in her  eye:    \"There isn't any hurry, child. Sit down and have your call out. You've  seen Ludovic coming down the lane, and, I suppose, you think you'll be a  crowd. But you won't. Ludovic rather likes a third person around, and  so do I. It spurs up the conversation as it were. When a man has been  coming to see you straight along, twice a week for fifteen years, you  get rather talked out by spells.\"    Theodora never pretended to bashfulness where Ludovic was concerned.  She was not at all shy of referring to him and his dilatory courtship.  Indeed, it seemed to amuse her.    Anne sat down again and together they watched Ludovic coming down the  lane, gazing calmly about him at the lush clover fields and the blue  loops of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below.    Anne looked at Theodora's placid, finely-moulded face and tried to  imagine what she herself would feel like if she were sitting there,  waiting for an elderly lover who had, seemingly, taken so long to make  up his mind. But even Anne's imagination failed her for this.    \"Anyway,\" she thought, impatiently, \"if I wanted him I think I'd find  some way of hurrying him up. Ludovic SPEED! Was there ever such a misfit  of a name? Such a name for such a man is a delusion and a snare.\"    Presently Ludovic got to the house, but stood so long on the doorstep  in a brown study, gazing into the tangled green boskage of the cherry  orchard, that Theodora finally went and opened the door before he  knocked. As she brought him into the sitting-room she made a comical  grimace at Anne over his shoulder.    Ludovic smiled pleasantly at Anne. He liked her; she was the only young  girl he knew, for he generally avoided young girls--they made him feel  awkward and out of place. But Anne did not affect him in this fashion.  She had a way of getting on with all sorts of people, and, although they  had not known her very long, both Ludovic and Theodora looked upon her  as an old friend.    Ludovic was tall and somewhat ungainly, but his unhesitating placidity  gave him the appearance of a dignity that did not otherwise pertain to  him. He had a drooping, silky, brown moustache, and a little curly tuft  of imperial,--a fashion which was regarded as eccentric in Grafton,  where men had clean-shaven chins or went full-bearded. His eyes were  dreamy and pleasant, with a touch of melancholy in their blue depths.    He sat down in the big bulgy old armchair that had belonged to  Theodora's father. Ludovic always sat there, and Anne declared that the  chair had come to look like him.    The conversation soon grew animated enough. Ludovic was a good talker  when he had somebody to draw him out. He was well read, and frequently  surprised Anne by his shrewd comments on men and matters out in the  world, of which only the faint echoes reached Deland River. He had also  a liking for religious arguments with Theodora, who did not care much  for politics or the making of history, but was avid of doctrines, and  read everything pertaining thereto. When the conversation drifted  into an eddy of friendly wrangling between Ludovic and Theodora over  Christian Science, Anne understood that her usefulness was ended for the  time being, and that she would not be missed.    \"It's star time and good-night time,\" she said, and went away quietly.    But she had to stop to laugh when she was well out of sight of the  house, in a green meadow bestarred with the white and gold of daisies.  A wind, odour-freighted, blew daintily across it. Anne leaned against a  white birch tree in the corner and laughed heartily, as she was apt to  do whenever she thought of Ludovic and Theodora. To her eager youth,  this courtship of theirs seemed a very amusing thing. She liked Ludovic,  but allowed herself to be provoked with him.    \"The dear, big, irritating goose!\" she said aloud. \"There never was such  a lovable idiot before. He's just like the alligator in the old rhyme,  who wouldn't go along, and wouldn't keep still, but just kept bobbing up  and down.\"    Two evenings later, when Anne went over to the Dix place, she and  Theodora drifted into a conversation about Ludovic. Theodora, who was  the most industrious soul alive, and had a mania for fancy work into  the bargain, was busying her smooth, plump fingers with a very elaborate  Battenburg lace centre-piece. Anne was lying back in a little rocker,  with her slim hands folded in her lap, watching Theodora. She realized  that Theodora was very handsome, in a stately, Juno-like fashion of  firm, white flesh, large, clearly-chiselled outlines, and great, cowey,  brown eyes. When Theodora was not smiling, she looked very imposing.  Anne thought it likely that Ludovic held her in awe.    \"Did you and Ludovic talk about Christian Science ALL Saturday evening?\"  she asked.    Theodora overflowed into a smile.    \"Yes, and we even quarrelled over it. At least _I_ did. Ludovic wouldn't  quarrel with anyone. You have to fight air when you spar with him. I  hate to square up to a person who won't hit back.\"    \"Theodora,\" said Anne coaxingly, \"I am going to be curious and  impertinent. You can snub me if you like. Why don't you and Ludovic get  married?\"    Theodora laughed comfortably.    \"That's the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while,  I reckon, Anne. Well, I'd have no objection to marrying Ludovic. That's  frank enough for you, isn't it? But it's not easy to marry a man unless  he asks you. And Ludovic has never asked me.\"    \"Is he too shy?\" persisted Anne. Since Theodora was in the mood, she  meant to sift this puzzling affair to the bottom.    Theodora dropped her work and looked meditatively out over the green  slopes of the summer world.    \"No, I don't think it is that. Ludovic isn't shy. It's just his way--the  Speed way. The Speeds are all dreadfully deliberate. They spend  years thinking over a thing before they make up their minds to do it.  Sometimes they get so much in the habit of thinking about it that they  never get over it--like old Alder Speed, who was always talking of  going to England to see his brother, but never went, though there was  no earthly reason why he shouldn't. They're not lazy, you know, but they  love to take their time.\"    \"And Ludovic is just an aggravated case of Speedism,\" suggested Anne.    \"Exactly. He never hurried in his life. Why, he has been thinking for  the last six years of getting his house painted. He talks it over with  me every little while, and picks out the colour, and there the matter  stays. He's fond of me, and he means to ask me to have him sometime. The  only question is--will the time ever come?\"    \"Why don't you hurry him up?\" asked Anne impatiently.    Theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh.    \"If Ludovic could be hurried up, I'm not the one to do it. I'm too shy.  It sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that, but  it is true. Of course, I know it's the only way any Speed ever did make  out to get married. For instance, there's a cousin of mine married to  Ludovic's brother. I don't say she proposed to him out and out, but,  mind you, Anne, it wasn't far from it. I couldn't do anything like that.  I DID try once. When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow, and  all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand, I tried to  give Ludovic a hint. But it stuck in my throat. And now I don't mind. If  I don't change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative, it will be Dix  to the end of life. Ludovic doesn't realize that we are growing old, you  know.

The photographs are true likenesses of the people they are  supposed to represent, and while in some instances the correct names  are not given (for reasons which the reader will readily understand),  the various scenes, relics, etc., are true historically and  geographically. The places described can be easily recognized by any  one who has ever visited the section of Pennsylvania in which the plot  (if it can really be called a plot) of the story is laid.

MARY'S LETTERS RECEIVED AT CLEAR SPRING FARM.      One morning in early spring, John Landis, a Pennsylvania German farmer  living in Schuggenhaus Township, Bucks County, on opening his mail  box, fastened to a tree at the crossroads (for the convenience of  rural mail carriers) found one letter for his wife Sarah, the envelope  addressed in the well-known handwriting of her favorite niece, Mary  Midleton, of Philadelphia.    [Illustration]    A letter being quite an event at \"Clear Spring\" farm, he hastened with  it to the house, finding \"Aunt Sarah,\" as she was called by every one  (Great Aunt to Mary), in the cheery farm house kitchen busily engaged  kneading sponge for a loaf of rye bread, which she carefully deposited  on a well-floured linen cloth, in a large bowl for the final raising.    Carefully adjusting her glasses more securely over the bridge of her  nose, she turned at the sound of her husband's footsteps. Seeing the  letter in his hand she inquired: \"What news, John?\" Quickly opening  the letter handed her, she, after a hasty perusal, gave one of the  whimsical smiles peculiar to her and remarked decisively, with a  characteristic nod of her head: \"John, Mary Midleton intends to marry,  else why, pray tell me, would she write of giving up teaching her  kindergarten class in the city, to spend the summer with us on the  farm learning, she writes, to keep house, cook, economize and to learn  how to get the most joy and profit from life?\"    \"Well, well! Mary is a dear girl, why should she not think of  marrying?\" replied her husband; \"she is nineteen. Quite time, I think,  she should learn housekeeping--something every young girl should know.  We should hear of fewer divorces and a less number of failures of men  in business, had their wives been trained before marriage to be good,  thrifty, economical housekeepers and, still more important, good  homemakers. To be a helpmate in every sense of the word is every  woman's duty, I think, when her husband works early and late to  procure the means to provide for her comforts and luxuries and a  competency for old age. Write Mary to come at once, and under your  teaching she may, in time, become as capable a housekeeper and as good  a cook as her Aunt Sarah; and, to my way of thinking, there is none  better, my dear.\"    Praise from her usually reticent husband never failed to deepen the  tint of pink on Aunt Sarah's still smooth, unwrinkled, youthful  looking face, made more charming by being framed in waves of silvery  gray hair, on which the \"Hand of Time,\" in passing, had sprinkled some  of the dust from the road of life.    In size, Sarah Landis was a little below medium height, rather stout,  or should I say comfortable, and matronly looking; very erect for a  woman of her age. Her bright, expressive, gray eyes twinkled  humorously when she talked. She had developed a fine character by her  years of unselfish devotion to family and friends. Her splendid sense  of humor helped her to overcome difficulties, and her ability to rise  above her environment, however discouraging their conditions,  prevented her from being unhappy or depressed by the small annoyances  met daily. She never failed to find joy and pleasure in the faithful  performance of daily tasks, however small or insignificant. Aunt Sarah  attributed her remarkably fine, clear complexion, seldom equalled in a  woman of her years, to good digestion and excellent health; her love  of fresh air, fruit and clear spring water. She usually drank from  four to five tumblerfuls of water a day. She never ate to excess, and  frequently remarked: \"I think more people suffer from over-eating than  from insufficient food.\" An advocate of deep breathing, she spent as  much of her time as she could spare from household duties in the open  air.    [Illustration: AUNT SARAH]    Sarah Landis was not what one would call beautiful, but good and  whole-souled looking. To quote her husband: \"To me Sarah never looks  so sweet and homelike when all 'fussed up' in her best black dress on  special occasions, as she does when engaged in daily household tasks  around home, in her plain, neat, gray calico dress.\"    This dress was always covered with a large, spotlessly clean, blue  gingham apron of small broken check, and she was very particular about  having a certain-sized check. The apron had a patch pocket, which  usually contained small twists or little wads of cord, which, like  \"The Old Ladies in Cranford,\" she picked up and saved for a"]]]
