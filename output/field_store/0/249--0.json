If so, it follows that the study of infancy and childhood  must rise into corresponding prominence. More and more a considerable  part of the Profession must busy itself in nurseries and in schools,  seeking to apply there the teachings of Psychology, Physiology,  Heredity, and Hygiene. To work of this kind, in some of its aspects,  this book may serve as an introduction. It deals with the influences  which mould the mentality of the child and shape his conduct. Extreme  susceptibility to these influences is the mark of the nervous child.    I have to thank the Editors of _The Practitioner_ and of _The Child_,  respectively, for permission to reprint the chapters which deal with  \"Enuresis\" and \"The Nervous Child in Sickness.\" To Dr. F.H.

The story, I think, does not tell us  much else concerning the princess. It does not tell us, for instance,  if she was an only child, the sole preoccupation of her parents and  nurses, surrounded by the most anxious care, reared with some  difficulty because of her extraordinary \"delicacy,\" suffering from a  variety of illnesses which somehow always seemed to puzzle the  doctors, though some of the symptoms--the vomiting, for example, and  the high temperature--were very severe and persistent. Nor does it  tell us if later in life, but before the suffering from the pea arose,  she had been taken to consult two famous doctors, one of whom had  removed the vermiform appendix, while the other a little later had  performed an operation for \"adhesions.\" At any rate, the story with  these later additions, which are at least in keeping with what we know  of her history, would serve to indicate the importance which attaches  to the early training of childhood. Among the children even of the  well-to-do often enough the hygiene of the mind is overlooked, and  faulty management produces restlessness, instability, and  hyper-sensitiveness, which pass insensibly into neuropathy in adult  life.    To prevent so distressing a result is our aim in the training of  children. No doubt the matter concerns in the first place parents and  nurses, school masters and mistresses, as well as medical men. Yet  because of the certainty that physical disturbances of one sort or  another will follow upon nervous unrest, it will seldom happen that  medical advice will not be sought sooner or later; and if the  physician is to intervene with success, he must be prepared with  knowledge of many sorts. He must be prepared to make a thorough and  complete physical examination, sufficient to exclude the presence of  organic disease. If no organic disease is found, he must explore the  whole environment of the child, and seek to determine whether the  exciting cause is to be found in the reaction of the child to some  form of faulty management.    For example, a child of two or three years of age may be brought to  the doctor with the complaint that defaecation is painful, and that  there has existed for some time a most distressing constipation which  has resisted a large number of purgatives of increasing strength.  Whenever the child is placed upon the stool, his crying at once  begins, and no attempts to soothe or console him have been successful.  It is not sufficient for the doctor in such a case to make an  examination which convinces him that there is no fissure at the anus  and no fistula or thrombosed pile, and to confine himself to saying  that he can find nothing the matter. The crying and refusal to go to  stool will continue after the visit as before, and the mother will be  apt to conclude that her doctor, though she has the greatest  confidence in him for the ailments of grown-up persons, is unskilled  in, or at least not interested in, the diseases of little children.  If, on the other hand, the doctor pursues his inquiries into the  management of the child in the home, and if, for example, he finds  that the crying and resistance is not confined to going to stool, but  also takes place when the child is put to bed, and very often at  meal-times as well, then it will be safe for him to conclude that all  the symptoms are due to the same cause--a sort of \"negativism\" which  is apt to appear in all children who are directed and urged too much,  and whose parents are not careful to hide from them the anxiety and  distress which their conduct occasions.    If this diagnosis is made, then a full and clear explanation should be  given to the mother, or at any rate to such mothers--and fortunately  they are in the majority--who are capable of appreciating the point of  psychology involved, and of correcting the management of the child so  as to overcome the negativism. To attempt treatment by prescribing  drugs, or in any other way than by correcting the faulty management,  is to court failure. As Charcot has said, in functional disorders it  is not so much the prescription which matters as the prescriber.    But the task of the doctor is often one of even greater difficulty.  Often enough there will be a combination of organic disturbance with  functional trouble. For example, a girl of eighteen years old suffered  from a pain in the left arm which has persisted on and off since the  olecranon had been fractured when she was two years of age. She was  the youngest of a large family, and had never been separated for a day  from the care and apprehensions of her mother. The joint was stiff,  and there was considerable deformity. The pain always increased when  she was tired or unhappy. Again, a girl had some slight cystitis with  frequent micturition, and this passed by slow degrees into a purely  functional irritability of the bladder, which called for micturition  at frequent intervals both by day and night. In such cases treatment  must endeavour to control both factors--the local organic disturbance  must if possible be removed, and the faults of management corrected.    It is a good physician who can appreciate and estimate accurately the  temperament of his patient, and the need for this insight is nowhere  greater than in dealing with the disorders of childhood. It can be  acquired only by long practice and familiarity with children. In the  hospital wards we shall learn much that is essential, but we shall not  learn this. The child, who is so sensitive to his environment, shows  but little that is characteristic when admitted to an institution.  Only in the nursery can we learn to estimate the influences which  proceed from parents and nurses of different characters and  temperaments, and the reaction which is produced by them in the child.    The body of the child is moulded and shaped by the environment in  which it grows. Pure air, a rational diet, free movement, give  strength and symmetry to every part. Faults of hygiene debase the  type, although the type is determined by heredity which in the  individual is beyond our control. Mothers and nurses to-day are well  aware of the need for a rational hygiene. Mother-craft is studied  zealously and with success, and there is no lack of books to give  sound guidance and to show the mean between the dangerous extremes of  coddling and a too Spartan exposure. Yet sometimes it has seemed as if  some mothers whose care for their children's physical health is most  painstaking, who have nothing to learn on the question of diet, of  exercise, of fresh air, or of baths, who measure and weigh and record  with great minuteness, have had their attention so wholly occupied  with the care of the body that they do not appreciate the simultaneous  growth of the mind, or inquire after its welfare.

Plaatje  Editor of `Tsala ea Batho', Kimberley, S.A.  Author of `Sechuana Proverbs and their European Equivalents'    Fourth Edition          Foreword (Native Life in South Africa electronic text):        Sol Plaatje began work on `Native Life in South Africa' in 1914,  while on his way to Britain to plead with the Imperial Government  against the Natives' Land Act of 1913, as part of a deputation  of the South African Native National Congress.  The book was intended  as a means of reaching the British public with the deputation's message.    The method seemed sound enough -- it was quite similar in form  to the successful deputation which had pleaded to keep Bechuanaland  (modern Botswana) under direct Imperial control in 1895.  But circumstances were different in 1914 -- South Africa  had been granted self-government, and the First World War began  shortly after the deputation's arrival in England and distracted all parties.  This latter event also influenced the final form of the book,  as Plaatje played to the patriotic sentiment so strong in Britain at the time.  For all his appeals, Plaatje did not succeed:  the Act went on to become  one of the first steps toward the system of Apartheid.  For all that,  there is sometimes in defeat the seeds of victory -- these troubles  united black South Africans like nothing before, and Plaatje's successors,  in the form of the ANC, finally succeeded in the early 1990's.    The Natives' Land Act of 1913, which forbade natives to buy or rent land,  except in a few small reserves consisting largely of wasteland,  was finally overturned in 1991.      Thanks should be given to Neil Parsons, for his advice on this subject,  and for being so kind as to research and write the introduction that follows.      Alan R. Light    July, 1998.   Monroe, North Carolina (USA).            Introduction, by Neil Parsons        \"Native Life in South Africa\" is one of the most remarkable books on Africa,  by one of the continent's most remarkable writers.  It was written  as a work of impassioned political propaganda, exposing the plight  of black South Africans under the whites-only government of newly unified  South Africa.  It focuses on the effects of the 1913 Natives' Land Act  which introduced a uniform system of land segregation between the races.  It resulted, as Plaatje shows, in the immediate expulsion of blacks,  as \"squatters\", from their ancestral lands in the Orange Free State  now declared \"white\".  But Native Life succeeds in being  much more than a work of propaganda.  It is a vital social document  which captures the spirit of an age and shows the effects of rural segregation  on the everyday life of people.    Solomon Tshekeisho Plaatje was born in 1878 in the lands of  the Tswana-speaking people, south of Mafeking.  His origins  were ordinary enough.  What was remarkable was the aptitude he showed  for education and learning after a few years schooling under the tuition  of a remarkable liberal German Lutheran missionary, the Rev. Ludorf.  At the age of sixteen Plaatje (using the Dutch nickname of his grandfather  as a surname) joined the Post Office as a mail-carrier in Kimberley,  the diamond city in the north of Cape Colony.  He subsequently passed  the highest clerical examination in the colony, beating every white candidate  in both Dutch and typing.    From Kimberley the young Plaatje went on to Mafeking, where he was  one of the key players in the great siege of 1899-1900.  As magistrate's interpreter he was the vital link between  the British civil authorities and the African majority  beleaguered inside the town's military perimeter.  Plaatje's diaries  from this period, published long after his death, are a remarkable record  both of the siege and of his early prose experimentation --  mixing languages and idioms, and full of bright humour.    After the war Plaatje became a journalist, editor first  of one Tswana language newspaper at Mafeking and then of another at Kimberley.  Like other educated Africans he came out of the war optimistic that  the British would enfranchise all educated and propertied males  in the defeated Boer colonies (Transvaal and Orange Free State)  without regard to race.  But in this he, and the others,  were soon sorely disappointed.  The British gave a whites-only franchise  to the defeated Boers and thus conceded power to a Boer or white Afrikaner  parliamentary majority in the 1910 Union of South Africa  which brought together the two Boer colonies with Cape Colony and Natal.  Clinging to the old but diminished \"colour blind\" franchise of the Cape,  Plaatje remained one of the few Africans in South Africa  with a parliamentary vote.    Plaatje's aggravation with the British government can be seen  in an unpublished manuscript of 1908-09 titled \"Sekgoma -- the Black Dreyfus\".  In this booklet he castigated the British for denying legal rights  (specifically habeas corpus) to their African subjects  outside the Cape Colony.    Plaatje became politically active in the \"native congress\" movement  which represented the interests of educated and propertied Africans  all over South Africa.  He was the first secretary-general  of the \"South African Native National Congress\", founded in 1912  (which renamed itself as the African National Congress or ANC  ten years later).    The first piece of major legislation presented to the whites-only  parliament of South Africa was the Natives' Land Act, eventually passed  in 1913, which was designed to entrench white power and property rights  in the countryside -- as well as to solve the \"native problem\" of  African peasant farmers working for themselves and denying their labour power  to white employers.    The main battle ground for the implementation of the new legislation  was the Orange Free State.  White farmers took the cue from the Land Act  to begin expelling black peasants from their land as \"squatters\",  while the police began to rigorously enforce the pass-laws  which registered the employment of Africans and prescribed  their residence and movement rights.    The Free State became the cockpit of resistance by the newly formed SANNC.  Its womens' league demonstrated against pass law enforcement  in Free State towns.  Its national executive sent a delegation to England,  icluding Plaatje, who set sail in mid-1914.  The British crown retained  ultimate rights of sovereignty over the parliament and government  of South Africa, with an as yet unexercised power of veto over  South African legislation in the area of \"native affairs\".    The delegation received short shrift from the government in London which was,  after all, more than preoccupied with the coming of the Great War --  in which it feared for the loyalty of the recently defeated Afrikaners  and wished in no way to offend them.  But, rather than return empty-handed  like the rest of the SANNC delegation, Plaatje decided  to stay in England to carry on the fight.  He was determined to recuit,  through writing and lecturing, the liberal and humanitarian establishment  to his side -- so that it in turn might pressure the British government.    Thus it was that Plaatje resumed work on a manuscript he had begun  on the ship to England.  \"Native Life in South Africa\".  The book was published in 1916 by P. S. King in London.  It was dedicated to Harriette Colenso, doughty woman camnpaigner  who had inherited from her father, Bishop Colenso, the mantle of advocate  to the British establishment of the rights of the Zulu nation in South Africa.    While in England Plaatje pursued his interests in language and linguistics  by collaborating with Professor Daniel Jones of the University of London --  inventor of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and prototype for  Professor Higgins in Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" and thus the musical \"My Fair Lady\".  In the same year as Native Life was published, 1916, Plaatje published  two other shorter books which brought together the European languages  (English, Dutch and German) he loved with the Tswana language.  \"Sechuana Proverbs\" was a listing of Tswana proverbs with  their European equivalents.  \"A Sechuana Reader\" was co-authored with Jones,  using the IPA for Tswana orthography.    Plaatje returned to South Africa but went once again to England  after the war's end, to lead a second SANNC delegation keen to make its mark  on the peace negotiations in 1919.  This time Plaatje managed to get  as far as the prime minister, Lloyd George, \"the Welsh wizard\".  Lloyd George was duly impressed with Plaatje and undertook  to present his case to General Jan Smuts in the South African government,  a supposedly liberal fellow-traveller.  But Smuts, whose notions of liberalism  were patronizingly segregationist, fobbed off Lloyd George  with an ingenuous reply.    Disillusioned with the flabby friendship of British liberals,  Plaatje was increasingly drawn to the pan-Africanism of W. E. B. Du Bois,  president of the NAACP in the United States."]]]
