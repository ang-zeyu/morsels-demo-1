NEW YORK, AUGUST 12, 1850. No. 7.           *       *       *       *       *          WOMEN AND LITERATURE IN FRANCE.    From a sprightly letter from Paris to the _Cologne Gazette_, we  translate for _The International_ the following account of the  position of women in the French Republic, together with the  accompanying gossip concerning sundry ladies whose names have long  been quite prominently before the public:    \"It is curious that the idea of the emancipation of women should have  originated in France, for there is no country in Europe where the  sex have so little reason to complain of their position as in this,  especially at Paris. Leaving out of view a certain paragraph of the  _Code Civile_--and that is nothing but a sentence in a law-book--and  looking closely into the features of women's life, we see that they  are not only queens who reign, but also ministers who govern.    \"In France women are engaged in a large proportion of civil  employments, and may without hesitation devote themselves to art and  science. It is indeed astonishing to behold the interest with which  the beautiful sex here enter upon all branches of art and knowledge.    \"The ateliers of the painters number quite as many female as male  students, and there are apparently more women than men who copy the  pictures in the Louvre. Nothing is more pleasing than to see these  gentle creatures, with their easels, sitting before a colossal Rubens  or a Madonna of Raphael. No difficulty alarms them, and prudery is not  allowed to give a voice in their choice of subjects.    \"I have never yet attended a lecture, by either of the professors  here, but I have found some seats occupied by ladies. Even the  lectures of Michel Chevalier and Blanqui do not keep back the  eagerness of the charming Parisians in pursuit of science. That  Michelet and Edgar Quinet have numerous female disciples is  accordingly not difficult to believe.    \"Go to a public session of the Academy, and you find the '_cercle_'  filled almost exclusively by ladies, and these laurel-crowned heads  have the delight of seeing their immortal works applauded by the  clapping of tenderest hands. In truth, the French savan is uncommonly  clear in the most abstract things; but it would be an interesting  question, whether the necessity of being not alone easily intelligible  but agreeable to the capacity of comprehension possessed by the  unschooled mind of woman, has not largely contributed to the facility  and charm which is peculiar to French scientific literature. Read  for example the discourse on Cabanis, pronounced by Mignet at the  last session. It would be impossible to write more charmingly, more  elegantly, more attractively, even upon a subject within the range  of the fine arts. The works, and especially the historical works, of  the French, are universally diffused. Popular histories, so-called  editions for the people, are here entirely unknown; everything that  is published is in a popular edition, and if as great and various care  were taken for the education of the people as in Germany, France would  in this respect be the first country in the world.    \"With the increasing influence of monarchical ideas in certain  circles, the women seem to be returning to the traditions of monarchy,  and are throwing themselves into the business of making memoirs.  Hardly have George Sand's Confessions been announced, and already new  enterprises in the same line are set on foot. The European dancer,  who is perhaps more famous for making others dance to her music,  and who has enjoyed a monopoly of cultivated scandal, Lola Montes,  also intends to publish her memoirs. They will of course contain  an interesting fragment of German federal politics, and form a  contribution to German revolutionary literature. Lola herself is still  too beautiful to devote her own time to the writing. Accordingly, she  has resorted to the pen of M. Balzac. If Madame Balzac has nothing to  say against the necessary intimacy with the dangerous Spanish or Irish  or whatever woman--for Lola Montes is a second Homer--the reading  world may anticipate an interesting, chapter of life. No writer is  better fitted for such a work than so profound a man of the world, and  so keen a painter of character, as Balzac.    \"The well-known actress, Mlle. Georges, who was in her prime during  the most remarkable epoch of the century, and was in relations  with the most prominent persons of the Empire, is also preparing a  narrative of her richly varied experiences. Perhaps these attractive  examples may induce Madame Girardin also to bestow her memoirs upon  us, and so the process can be repeated infinitely.\"           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHORS AND BOOKS.           *       *       *       *       *    Parke Godwin has just given to the public, through Mr. Putnam, a new  edition of the translation made by himself and some literary friends,  of Goethe's \"Autobiography, or Truth and Poetry from My Life.\" In his  new preface Mr. Godwin exposes one of the most scandalous pieces of  literary imposition that we have ever read of. This translation, with  a few verbal alterations which mar its beauty and lessen its fidelity,  has been reprinted in \"Bohn's Standard Library,\" in London, as an  original English version, in the making of which \"the American was of  _occasional use_,\" &c. Mr. Godwin is one of our best German scholars,  and his discourse last winter on the character and genius of Goethe,  illustrated his thorough appreciation of the Shakspeare of the  Continent, and that affectionate sympathy which is so necessary to  the task of turning an author from one language into another. There  are very few books in modern literature more attractive or more  instructive to educated men than this Autobiography of Goethe, for  which we are indebted to him.           *       *       *       *       *    John Randolph is the best subject for a biography, that our political  experience has yet furnished. Who that remembers the long and slender  man of iron, with his scarcely human scorn of nearly all things  beyond his \"old Dominion,\" and his withering wit, never restrained  by any pity, and his passion for destroying all fabrics of policy or  reputation of which he was not himself the architect, but will read  with anticipations of keen interest the announcement of a life of  the eccentric yet great Virginian! Such a work, by the Hon. Hugh  A. Garland, is in the press of the Appletons. We know little of Mr.  Garland's capacities in this way, but if his book prove not the most  attractive in the historical literature of the year, the fault will  not be in its subject.           *       *       *       *       *    The Scottish Booksellers have instituted a society for professional  objects under the title of the \"Edinburgh Booksellers' Union.\" In  addition to business purposes, they propose to collect and preserve  books and pamphlets written by or relating to booksellers, printers,  engravers, or members of collateral professions,--rare editions of  other works--and generally articles connected with parties belonging  to the above professions, whether literary, professional, or personal.           *       *       *       *       *    D'Israeli abandons himself now-a-days entirely to politics. \"The  forehead high, and gleaming eye, and lip awry, of Benjamin D'Israeli,\"  sung once by _Fraser_ are no longer seen before the title-pages of  \"Wondrous Tales,\" but only before the Speaker. It is much referred to,  that in the recent parliamentary commemoration of Sir Robert Peel,  the Hebrew commoner kept silence; his long war of bitter sarcasm and  reproach on the defunct statesman was too freshly remembered. Peel  rarely exerted himself to more advantage than in his replies, to  D'Israeli, all noticeable for subdued disdain, conscious patriotism,  and argumentative completeness. For injustice experienced through  life, the meritorious dead are in a measure revenged by the  feelings of their accusers or detractors, when the latter retain the  sensibility which the grave usually excites, and especially amid such  a chorus of applause from all parties, and a whole people, as we have  now in England for Sir Robert Peel--the only man in the Empire, except  Wellington, who had a strictly personal authority.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Dickson, recently of the Medical Department of the New York  University, and whose ill-health induced the resignation of the chair  he held there, has returned to Charleston, and we observe that his  professional and other friends in that city greeted him with a public  dinner, on the 9th ult. Dr. Dickson we believe is one of the most  classically elegant writers upon medical science in the United States.  He ranks with Chapman and Oliver Wendell Holmes in the grace of  his periods as well as in the thoroughness of his learning and the  exactness and acuteness of his logic. Like Holmes, too, he is a poet,  and, generally, a very accomplished _litterateur_. We regret the loss  that New York sustains in his removal, but congratulate Charleston  upon the recovery of one of the best known and most loved attractions  of her society.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. John R.

Probably the most important years in anyone's life are those eight or  ten preceding the twenty-first birthday. During these years  _Heredity_, one of the two great developmental factors, bears its  crop, and the seeds sown before birth and during childhood come to  maturity. During these years also the other great developmental force  known as _Environment_ has full play, the still plastic nature is  moulded by circumstances, and the influence of these two forces is  seen in the manner of individual that results.    This time is generally alluded to under two heads: (1) Puberty, (2)  Adolescence.    By Puberty we understand the period when the reproductive organs are  developed, the boy or girl ceasing to be the neutral child and  acquiring the distinctive characteristics of man or woman. The actual  season of puberty varies in different individuals from the eleventh to  the sixteenth year, and although the changes during this time are not  sudden, they are comparatively rapid.    By Adolescence we understand the time during which the individual is  approximating to the adult type, puberty having been already  accomplished. Adolescence corresponds to the latter half of the  developmental period, and may be prolonged even up to twenty-five  years.          CHAPTER I.    CHANGES OBSERVABLE DURING PUBERTY AND ADOLESCENCE IN GIRLS.      1. Changes in the Bodily Framework.--During this period the girl's  skeleton not only grows remarkably in size, but is also the subject of  well-marked alterations and development. Among the most evident  changes are those which occur in the shape and inclination of the  pelvis. During the years of childhood the female pelvis has a general  resemblance to that of the male, but with the advent of puberty the  vertical portion of the hip bones becomes expanded and altered in  shape, it becomes more curved, and its inner surface looks less  directly forward and more towards its fellow bone of the other side.  The brim of the pelvis, which in the child is more or less  heart-shaped, becomes a wide oval, and consequently the pelvic girdle  gains considerably in width. The heads of the thigh bones not only  actually, in consequence of growth, but also relatively, in  consequence of change of shape in the pelvis, become more widely  separated from each other than they are in childhood, and hence the  gait and the manner of running alters greatly in the adult woman. At  the same time the angle made by the junction of the spinal column with  the back of the pelvis, known as the sacro-vertebral angle, becomes  better marked, and this also contributes to the development of the  characteristic female type. No doubt the female type of pelvis can be  recognised in childhood, and even before birth, but the differences of  male and female pelves before puberty are so slight that it requires  the eye of an expert to distinguish them. The very remarkable  differences that are found between the adult male and the adult female  pelvis begin to appear with puberty and develop rapidly, so that no  one could mistake the pelvis of a properly developed girl of sixteen  or eighteen years of age for that of a boy. These differences are due  in part to the action of the muscles and ligaments on the growing  bones, in part to the weight of the body from above and the reaction  of the ground from beneath, but they are also largely due to the  growth and development of the internal organs peculiar to the woman.  All these organs exist in the normal infant at birth, but they are  relatively insignificant, and it is not until the great developmental  changes peculiar to puberty occur that they begin to exercise their  influence on the shape of the bones. This is proved by the fact that  in those rare cases in which the internal organs of generation are  absent, or fail to develop, there is a corresponding failure in the  pelvis to alter into the normal adult shape. The muscles of the  growing girl partake in the rapid growth and development of her bony  framework. Sometimes the muscles outgrow the bones, causing a peculiar  lankiness and slackness of figure, and in other girls the growth of  the bones appears to be too rapid for the muscles, to which fact a  certain class of \"growing pain\" has been attributed.    Another part of the body that develops rapidly during these momentous  years is the bust. The breasts become large, and not only add to the  beauty of the girl's person, but also manifestly prepare by increase  of their glandular elements for the maternal function of suckling  infants.    Of less importance so far as structure is concerned, but of great  importance to female loveliness and attractiveness, are the changes  that occur in the clearing and brightening of the complexion, the  luxuriant growth, glossiness, and improved colour of the hair, and the  beauty of the eyes, which during the years which succeed puberty  acquire a new and singularly attractive expression.    The young girl's hands and feet do not grow in proportion with her  legs and arms, and appear to be more beautifully shaped when  contrasted with the more fully developed limb.    With regard to the internal organs, the most important are those of  the pelvis. The uterus, or womb, destined to form a safe nest for the  protection of the child until it is sufficiently developed to maintain  an independent existence, increases greatly in all its dimensions and  undergoes certain changes in shape; and the ovaries, which are  intended to furnish the ovules, or eggs (the female contribution  towards future human beings), also develop both in size and in  structure.    Owing to rapid growth and to the want of stability of the young girl's  tissues, the years immediately succeeding puberty are not only those  of rapid physiological change, but they are those during which  irreparable damage may be done unless those who have the care of young  girls understand what these dangers are, how they are produced, and  how they may be averted.    With regard to the bony skeleton, lateral curvature of the spine is,  in mild manifestation, very frequent, and is too common even in the  higher degrees. The chief causes of this deformity are:    (1) The natural softness and want of stability in the rapidly growing  bones and muscles;    (2) The rapid development of the bust, which throws a constantly  increasing burden on these weakened muscles and bones; and    (3) The general lassitude noticeable amongst girls at this time which  makes them yield to the temptation to stand on one leg, to cross one  leg over the other, and to write or read leaning on one elbow and  bending over the table, whereas they ought to be sitting upright.  Unless constant vigilance is exerted, deformity is pretty sure to  occur--a deformity which always has a bad influence over the girl's  health and strength, and which, in those cases where it is complicated  by the pathological softness of bones found in cases of rickets, may  cause serious alteration in shape and interfere with the functions of  the pelvis in later life.    2. Changes in the Mental Nature.--These are at least as remarkable  as the changes in the bodily framework. There is a slight diminution  in the power of memorising, but the faculties of attention, of  reasoning, and of imagination, develop rapidly. Probably the power of  appreciation of the beautiful appears about this time, a faculty which  is usually dormant during childhood. More especially is this true with  regard to the beauty of landscape; the child seldom enjoys a landscape  as such, although isolated beauties, such as that of flowers, may  sometimes be appreciated.    As might be anticipated, all things are changing with the child during  these momentous years: its outlook on life, its appreciation of other  people and of itself, alter greatly and continuously. The wonderfully  rapid growth and alterations in structure of the generative organs  have their counterpart in the mental and moral spheres; there are new  sensations which are scarcely recognised and are certainly not  understood by the subject: vague feelings of unrest, ill-comprehended  desires, and an intense self-consciousness take the place of the  unconscious egoism of childhood.    The processes of Nature as witnessed in the season of spring have  their counterpart in the changes that occur during the early years of  adolescence. The earth warmed by the more direct rays of the sun and  softened by recurring showers is transformed in a few weeks from its  bare and dry winter garb into the wonderful beauty of spring. This  yearly miracle fails to impress us as it should do because we have  witnessed it every year of our lives, and so, too, the great  transformation from child to budding woman fails to make its appeal to  our understanding and sympathy because it is of so common"]]]
