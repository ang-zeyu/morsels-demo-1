H. F. CARY, M.A.          PARADISE    Canto 1 - 33        CANTO I    His glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,  Pierces the universe, and in one part  Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.  In heav'n,  That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,  Witness of things, which to relate again  Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;  For that, so near approaching its desire  Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd,  That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,  That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm  Could store, shall now be matter of my song.    Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,  And make me such a vessel of thy worth,  As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.  Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows  Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both  For my remaining enterprise Do thou  Enter into my bosom, and there breathe  So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd  Forth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine!  If thou to me of shine impart so much,  That of that happy realm the shadow'd form  Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,  Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree  Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;  For to that honour thou, and my high theme  Will fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!  To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath  Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills  Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring  From the Pierian foliage, when one breast  Is with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small spark  Great flame hath risen: after me perchance  Others with better voice may pray, and gain  From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.    Through diver passages, the world's bright lamp  Rises to mortals, but through that which joins  Four circles with the threefold cross, in best  Course, and in happiest constellation set  He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives  Its temper and impression.  Morning there,  Here eve was by almost such passage made;  And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,  Blackness the other part; when to the left  I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun  Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.  As from the first a second beam is wont  To issue, and reflected upwards rise,  E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,  So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd  Into my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,  Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes  Upon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,  That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place  Made for the dwelling of the human kind    I suffer'd it not long, and yet so long  That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,  As iron that comes boiling from the fire.  And suddenly upon the day appear'd  A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,  Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.    Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,  Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken  Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd  At her aspect, such inwardly became  As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,  That made him peer among the ocean gods;  Words may not tell of that transhuman change:  And therefore let the example serve, though weak,  For those whom grace hath better proof in store    If I were only what thou didst create,  Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,  Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.  Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,  Desired Spirit! with its harmony  Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,  Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze  With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made  A lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,  And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,  Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.    Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,  To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,  Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:  \"With false imagination thou thyself  Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,  Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.  Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;  For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place  Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd.\"    Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt,  By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,  Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,  And said: \"Already satisfied, I rest  From admiration deep, but now admire  How I above those lighter bodies rise.\"    Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,  She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,  As on her frenzied child a mother casts;  Then thus began: \"Among themselves all things  Have order; and from hence the form, which makes  The universe resemble God.  In this  The higher creatures see the printed steps  Of that eternal worth, which is the end  Whither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,  In this their order, diversely, some more,  Some less approaching to their primal source.  Thus they to different havens are mov'd on  Through the vast sea of being, and each one  With instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;  This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,  This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,  This the brute earth together knits, and binds.  Nor only creatures, void of intellect,  Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,  That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd.  That Providence, who so well orders all,  With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,  In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,  Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat  Predestin'd, we are carried by the force  Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,  But at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,  That as ofttimes but ill accords the form  To the design of art, through sluggishness  Of unreplying matter, so this course  Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who  Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;  As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,  From its original impulse warp'd, to earth,  By vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire  Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse  Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height.  There would in thee for wonder be more cause,  If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself  Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.\"    So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.          CANTO II    All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,  Eager to listen, on the advent'rous track  Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,  Backward return with speed, and your own shores  Revisit, nor put out to open sea,  Where losing me, perchance ye may remain  Bewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I pass  Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,  Apollo guides me, and another Nine  To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.  Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck.  Timely for food of angels, on which here  They live, yet never know satiety,  Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out  Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad  Before you in the wave, that on both sides  Equal returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er  To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,  When they saw Jason following the plough.    The increate perpetual thirst, that draws  Toward the realm of God's own form, bore us  Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.    Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,  And in such space as on the notch a dart  Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself  Arriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight.  Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,  Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,  Bespake me: \"Gratefully direct thy mind  To God, through whom to this first star we come.\"    Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,  Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,  Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit  Within itself the ever-during pearl  Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light  Receives, and rests unbroken.  If I then  Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend  Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus  Another could endure, which needs must be  If body enter body, how much more  Must the desire inflame us to behold  That essence, which discovers by what means  God and our nature join'd!  There will be seen  That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,  But in itself intelligibly plain,  E'en as the truth that man at first believes.    I answered: \"Lady! I with thoughts devout,  Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,  Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.  But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots  Upon this body, which below on earth  Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\"    She somewhat smil'd, then spake: \"If mortals err  In their opinion, when the key of sense  Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen  Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings  Of reason to pursue the senses' flight  Are short.  But what thy own thought is, declare.\"    Then I: \"What various here above appears,  Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.\"    She then resum'd: \"Thou certainly wilt see  In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well  Thou listen to the arguments, which I  Shall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays  Numberless lights, the which in kind and size  May be remark'd of different aspects;  If rare or dense of that were cause alone,  One single virtue then would be in all,  Alike distributed, or more, or less.  Different virtues needs must be the fruits  Of formal principles, and these, save one,  Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside,  If rarity were of that dusk the cause,  Which thou inquirest, either in some part  That planet must throughout be void, nor fed  With its own matter; or, as bodies share  Their fat and leanness, in like manner this  Must in its volume change the leaves.  The first,  If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse  Been manifested, by transparency  Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.  But this is not.

HELL    CANTO I    IN the midway of this our mortal life,  I found me in a gloomy wood, astray  Gone from the path direct:  and e'en to tell  It were no easy task, how savage wild  That forest, how robust and rough its growth,  Which to remember only, my dismay  Renews, in bitterness not far from death.  Yet to discourse of what there good befell,  All else will I relate discover'd there.  How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,  Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd  My senses down, when the true path I left,  But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd  The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,  I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad  Already vested with that planet's beam,  Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.       Then was a little respite to the fear,  That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,  All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:  And as a man, with difficult short breath,  Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,  Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands  At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd  Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,  That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame  After short pause recomforted, again  I journey'd on over that lonely steep,  The hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent  Began, when, lo!  a panther, nimble, light,  And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,  Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove  To check my onward going; that ofttimes  With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.       The hour was morning's prime, and on his way  Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,  That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd  Those its fair works:  so that with joyous hope  All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin  Of that swift animal, the matin dawn  And the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas'd,  And by new dread succeeded, when in view  A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,  With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,  That e'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf  Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd  Full of all wants, and many a land hath made  Disconsolate ere now.  She with such fear  O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,  That of the height all hope I lost.  As one,  Who with his gain elated, sees the time  When all unwares is gone, he inwardly  Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,  Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,  Who coming o'er against me, by degrees  Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.       While to the lower space with backward step  I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,  Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.  When him in that great desert I espied,  \"Have mercy on me!\"  cried I out aloud,  \"Spirit!  or living man!  what e'er thou be!\"       He answer'd:  \"Now not man, man once I was,  And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both  By country, when the power of Julius yet  Was scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past  Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time  Of fabled deities and false.  A bard  Was I, and made Anchises' upright son  The subject of my song, who came from Troy,  When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.  But thou, say wherefore to such perils past  Return'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount  Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?\"  \"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,  From which such copious floods of eloquence  Have issued?\"  I with front abash'd replied.  \"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!  May it avail me that I long with zeal  Have sought thy volume, and with love immense  Have conn'd it o'er.  My master thou and guide!  Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd  That style, which for its beauty into fame  Exalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled.  O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!  For every vein and pulse throughout my frame  She hath made tremble.\"  He, soon as he saw  That I was weeping, answer'd, \"Thou must needs  Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape  From out that savage wilderness.  This beast,  At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none  To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:  So bad and so accursed in her kind,  That never sated is her ravenous will,  Still after food more craving than before.  To many an animal in wedlock vile  She fastens, and shall yet to many more,  Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy  Her with sharp pain.  He will not life support  By earth nor its base metals, but by love,  Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be  The land 'twixt either Feltro.  In his might  Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,  For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,  Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.  He with incessant chase through every town  Shall worry, until he to hell at length  Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.  I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,  That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide  Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,  Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see  Spirits of old tormented, who invoke  A second death; and those next view, who dwell  Content in fire, for that they hope to come,  Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,  Into whose regions if thou then desire  T' ascend, a spirit worthier then I  Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,  Thou shalt be left:  for that Almighty King,  Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,  Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,  That to his city none through me should come.  He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds  His citadel and throne.  O happy those,  Whom there he chooses!\"  I to him in few:  \"Bard!  by that God, whom thou didst not adore,  I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse  I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,  That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those  Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight.\"       Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.        CANTO II    NOW was the day departing, and the air,  Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd  All animals on earth; and I alone  Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,  Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,  Which my unerring memory shall retrace.       O Muses!  O high genius!  now vouchsafe  Your aid!  O mind!  that all I saw hast kept  Safe in a written record, here thy worth  And eminent endowments come to proof.       I thus began:  \"Bard!  thou who art my guide,  Consider well, if virtue be in me  Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise  Thou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,  Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among  Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there  Sensible present.  Yet if heaven's great Lord,  Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,  In contemplation of the high effect,  Both what and who from him should issue forth,  It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:  Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,  In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:  Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd  And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits  Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.  He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,  Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise  And to the papal robe.  In after-times  The chosen vessel also travel'd there,  To bring us back assurance in that faith,  Which is the entrance to salvation's way.  But I, why should I there presume?  or who  Permits it?  not, Aeneas I nor Paul.  Myself I deem not worthy, and none else  Will deem me.  I, if on this voyage then  I venture, fear it will in folly end.  Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,  Than I can speak.\"  As one, who unresolves  What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts  Changes his purpose, from his first intent  Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,  Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first  So eagerly embrac'd.  \"If right thy words  I scan,\" replied that shade magnanimous,  \"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft  So overcasts a man, that he recoils  From noblest resolution, like a beast  At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.  That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,  I will instruct thee why I came, and what  I heard in that same instant, when for thee  Grief touch'd me first.  I was among the tribe,  Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest  And lovely, I besought her to command,  Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star  Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft  Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:  \"O courteous shade of Mantua!  thou whose fame  Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!  A friend, not of my fortune but myself,  On the wide desert in his road has met  Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.  Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,  And I be ris'n too late for his relief,  From what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,  And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,  And by all means for his deliverance meet,  Assist him.  So to me will comfort spring.  I who now bid thee on this errand forth  Am Beatrice; from a place I come    (Note:  Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is  pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four  syllables, of which the third is a long one.)    Revisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,  Who prompts my speech.  When in my Master's sight  I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.\"       She then was silent, and I thus began:  \"O Lady!  by whose influence alone,  Mankind excels whatever is contain'd  Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,  So thy command delights me, that to obey,  If it were done already,"]]]
