These slaves were paid no  wages. Their masters gave them only food and clothes in return for their  work.    When any one wanted servants he went to market to buy them, just as  nowadays we buy horses and cows, or even tables and chairs.    If the poor slaves were bought by kind people they would be quite happy.  Then they would work willingly for their masters and mistresses, and  even love them. But very often cruel people bought slaves. These cruel  people used to beat them and be unkind to them in many other ways.    It was very wicked to buy and sell human beings as if they were cattle.  Yet Christian people did it, and many who were good and kind otherwise  thought there was no wrong in being cruel to their poor slaves. 'They  are only black people,' they said to themselves. 'Black people do not  feel things as we do.' That was not kind, as black people suffer pain  just in the same way as white people do.    One of the saddest things for the poor slaves was that they could never  long be a happy family all together--father, mother, and little brothers  and sisters--because at any time the master might sell the father or the  mother or one of the children to some one else. When this happened those  who were left behind were very sad indeed--more sad than if their dear  one had died.    Uncle Tom was a slave. He was a very faithful and honest servant, and  his master, Mr. Shelby, was kind to him. Uncle Tom's wife was called  Aunt Chloe. She was Mr. Shelby's head cook, and a very good one too, she  was. Nobody in all the country round could make such delicious pies and  cakes as Aunt Chloe.    Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe lived together in a pretty little cottage built  of wood, quite close to Mr. Shelby's big house.    The little cottage was covered with climbing roses, and the garden was  full of beautiful bright flowers and lovely fruit trees.    Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe lived happily for many years in their little  cottage, or cabin, as it was called. All day Uncle Tom used to work in  the fields, while Aunt Chloe was busy in the kitchen at Mr. Shelby's  house. When evening came they both went home to their cottage and their  children, and were merry together.    Mr. Shelby was a good man, and kind to his slaves, but he was not very  careful of his money. When he had spent all he had, he did not know what  to do to get more. At last he borrowed money from a man called Haley,  hoping to be able to pay it back again some day.    But that day never came. Haley grew impatient, and said, 'If you don't  pay what you owe me, I will take your house and lands, and sell them to  pay myself back all the money I have lent to you.'    So Mr. Shelby sold everything he could spare and gathered money together  in every way he could think of, but still there was not enough.    Then Haley said, 'Give me that slave of yours called Tom--he is worth a  lot of money.'    But Mr. Shelby knew that Haley was not a nice man. He knew he did not  want Tom for a servant, but only wanted to sell him again, to make more  money. So Mr. Shelby said, 'No, I can't do that. I never mean to sell  any of my slaves, least of all Tom. He has been with me since he was a  little boy.'    'Oh very well,' said Haley, 'I shall sell your house and lands, as I  said I should.'    Mr. Shelby could not bear to think of that, so he agreed to let Haley  have Tom. He made him promise, however, not to sell Tom again except to  a kind master.    'Very well,' said Haley, 'but Tom isn't enough. I must have another  slave.'    Just at this moment a little boy came dancing into the room where Mr.  Shelby and Haley were talking.    He was a pretty, merry little fellow, the son of a slave called Eliza,  who was Mrs. Shelby's maid.    'There now,' said Haley, 'give me that little chap, as well as Tom, and  we will say no more about the money you owe me.'    'I can't,' said Mr. Shelby. 'My wife is very fond of Eliza, and would  never hear of having Harry sold.'    'Oh, very well,' said Haley once more, 'I must just sell your house.'    So again Mr. Shelby gave in, and Haley went away with the promise that  next morning Uncle Tom and little Harry should be given to him, to be  his slaves.          CHAPTER II      ELIZA RUNS AWAY WITH LITTLE HARRY      Mr. Shelby was very unhappy because of what he had done. He knew his  wife would be very unhappy too, and he did not know how to tell her.    He had to do it that night, however, before she went to bed.    Mrs. Shelby could hardly believe it. 'Oh, you do not mean this,' she  said. 'You must not sell our good Tom and dear little Harry. Do anything  rather than that. It is a wicked, wicked thing to do.    'There is nothing else I can do,' said Mr. Shelby. 'I have sold  everything I can think of, and at any rate now that Haley has set his  heart on having Tom and Harry, he would not take anything or anybody  instead.'    Mrs. Shelby cried very much about it, but at last, though she was very,  very unhappy she fell asleep.    But some one whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby never thought of was listening to  this talk.    Eliza was sitting in the next room. The door was not quite closed, so  she could not help hearing what was said. As she listened she grew pale  and cold and a terrible look of pain came into her face.    Eliza had had three dear little children, but two of them had died when  they were tiny babies. She loved and cared for Harry all the more  because she had lost the others. Now he was to be taken from her and  sold to cruel men, and she would never see him again. She felt she could  not bear it.    Eliza's husband was called George, and was a slave too. He did not  belong to Mr. Shelby, but to another man, who had a farm quite near.  George and Eliza could not live together as a husband and wife generally  do. Indeed, they hardly ever saw each other. George's master was a cruel  man, and would not let him come to see his wife. He was so cruel, and  beat George so dreadfully, that the poor slave made up his mind to run  away. He had come that very day to tell Eliza what he meant to do.    As soon as Mr. and Mrs. Shelby stopped talking, Eliza crept away to her  own room, where little Harry was sleeping. There he lay with his pretty  curls around his face. His rosy mouth was half open, his fat little  hands thrown out over the bed-clothes, and a smile like a sunbeam upon  his face.    'My baby, my sweet-one,' said Eliza, 'they have sold you. But mother  will save you yet!'    She did not cry. She was too sad and sorrowful for that. Taking a piece  of paper and a pencil, she wrote quickly.    [Illustration]    'Oh, missis! dear missis! don't think me ungrateful--don't think hard of  me, anyway! I heard all you and master said to-night. I am going to try  to save my boy--you will not blame me I God bless and reward you for all  your kindness!'    Eliza was going to run away.    She gathered a few of Harry's clothes into a bundle, put on her hat and  jacket, and went to wake him.    Poor Harry was rather frightened at being waked in the middle of the  night, and at seeing his mother bending over him, with her hat and  jacket on.    'What is the matter, mother?' he said beginning to cry.    [Illustration]    'Hush,' she said, 'Harry mustn't cry or speak aloud, or they will hear  us. A wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother,  and carry him 'way off in the dark. But mother won't let him. She's  going to put on her little boy's cap and coat, and run off with him, so  the ugly man can't catch him.'    Harry stopped crying at once, and was good and quiet as a little mouse,  while his mother dressed him. When he was ready, she lifted him in her  arms, and crept softly out of the house.    It was a beautiful, clear, starlight night, but very cold, for it was  winter-time. Eliza ran quickly to Uncle Tom's cottage, and tapped on the  window.    Aunt Chloe was not asleep, so she jumped up at once, and opened the  door. She was very much astonished to see Eliza standing there with  Harry in her arms. Uncle Tom followed her to the door, and was very much  astonished too.    'I'm running away, Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child,'  said Eliza. 'Master sold him.'    'Sold him?' they both echoed, lifting up their hands in dismay.    'Yes, sold him,' said Eliza. 'I heard master tell missis that he had  sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom. The man is coming to take you away  to-morrow.'    At first Tom could hardly believe what he heard. Then he sank down, and  buried his face in his hands.    'The good Lord have pity on us!' said Aunt Chloe. 'What has Tom done  that master should sell him?'    [Illustration]    'He hasn't done anything--it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell;  but he owes this man money. If he doesn't pay him it will end in his  having to sell the house and all the slaves. Master said he was sorry.  But missis she talked like an angel. I'm a wicked girl to leave her so,  but I can't help it. It must be right; but if it an't right, the good  Lord will forgive me, for I can't help doing it.    'Tom,' said Aunt Chloe, 'why don't you go too? There's time.'    Tom slowly raised his head and looked sorrowfully at her.    'No, no,' he said. 'Let Eliza go. It is right that she should try to  save her boy. Mas'r has always trusted me, and I can't leave him like  that. It is better for me to go alone than for the whole place to be  sold. Mas'r isn't to blame, Chloe. He will take care of you and the  poor--'    Tom could say no more.

The historical growth of religion    Bibliography            CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM      A comparison of Christianity with Muhammedanism or with any other  religion must be preceded by a statement of the objects with which  such comparison is undertaken, for the possibilities which lie in this  direction are numerous. The missionary, for instance, may consider  that a knowledge of the similarities of these religions would increase  the efficacy of his proselytising work: his purpose would thus be  wholly practical. The ecclesiastically minded Christian, already  convinced of the superiority of his own religion, will be chiefly  anxious to secure scientific proof of the fact: the study of  comparative religion from this point of view was once a popular branch  of apologetics and is by no means out of favour at the present day.  Again, the inquirer whose historical perspective is undisturbed by  ecclesiastical considerations, will approach the subject with somewhat  different interests. He will expect the comparison to provide him with  a clear view of the influence which Christianity has exerted upon  other religions or has itself received from them: or he may hope by  comparing the general development of special religious systems to gain  a clearer insight into the growth of Christianity. Hence the object of  such comparisons is to trace the course of analogous developments and  the interaction of influence and so to increase the knowledge of  religion in general or of our own religion in particular.    A world-religion, such as Christianity, is a highly complex structure  and the evolution of such a system of belief is best understood by  examining a religion to which we have not been bound by a thousand  ties from the earliest days of our lives. If we take an alien religion  as our subject of investigation, we shall not shrink from the  consequences of the historical method: whereas, when we criticise  Christianity, we are often unable to see the falsity of the  pre-suppositions which we necessarily bring to the task of inquiry:  our minds follow the doctrines of Christianity, even as our bodies  perform their functions--in complete unconsciousness. At the same time  we possess a very considerable knowledge of the development of  Christianity, and this we owe largely to the help of analogy.  Especially instructive is the comparison between Christianity and  Buddhism. No less interesting are the discoveries to be attained by an  inquiry into the development of Muhammedanism: here we can see the  growth of tradition proceeding in the full light of historical  criticism. We see the plain man, Muhammed, expressly declaring in the  Qoran that he cannot perform miracles, yet gradually becoming a  miracle worker and indeed the greatest of his class: he professes to  be nothing more than a mortal man: he becomes the chief mediator  between man and God. The scanty memorials of the man become voluminous  biographies of the saint and increase from generation to generation.    Yet more remarkable is the fact that his utterances, his _logia_, if  we may use the term, some few of which are certainly genuine, increase  from year to year and form a large collection which is critically  sifted and expounded. The aspirations of mankind attribute to him such  words of the New Testament and of Greek philosophers as were  especially popular or seemed worthy of Muhammed; the teaching also of  the new ecclesiastical schools was invariably expressed in the form of  proverbial utterances attributed to Muhammed, and these are now  without exception regarded as authentic by the modern Moslem. In this  way opinions often contradictory are covered by Muhummed's authority.    The traditions concerning Jesus offer an analogy. Our Gospels, for  instance, relate the beautiful story of the plucking of the ears of  corn on the Sabbath, with its famous moral application, \"The Sabbath  was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.\" A Christian papyrus  has been discovered which represents Jesus as explaining the sanctity  of the Sabbath from the Judaeo-Christian point of view. \"If ye keep  not the Sabbath holy, ye shall not see the Father,\" is the statement  in an uncanonical Gospel. In early Christian literature, contradictory  sayings of Jesus are also to be found. Doubtless here, as in  Muhammedan tradition, the problem originally was, what is to be my  action in this or that question of practical life: answer is given in  accordance with the religious attitude of the inquirer and Jesus and  Muhammed are made to lend their authority to the teaching. Traditional  literary form is then regarded as historical by later believers.    Examples of this kind might be multiplied, but enough has been said to  show that much and, to some extent, new light may be thrown upon the  development of Christian tradition, by an examination of Muhammedanism  which rose from similar soil but a few centuries later, while its  traditional developments have been much more completely preserved.    Such analogies as these can be found, however, in any of the  world-religions, and we propose to devote our attention more  particularly to the influences which Christianity and Islam exerted  directly upon one another. While Muhammedanism has borrowed from its  hereditary foe, it has also repaid part of the debt. By the very fact  of its historical position Islam was at first indebted to  Christianity; but in the department of Christian philosophy, it has  also exerted its own influence. This influence cannot be compared with  that of Greek or Jewish thought upon Christian speculation: Christian  philosophy, as a metaphysical theory of existence, was however  strongly influenced by Arabian thought before the outset of the  Reformation. On the other hand the influence of Christianity upon  Islam--and also upon Muhammed, though he owed more to Jewish  thought--was so extensive that the coincidence of ideas upon the most  important metaphysical questions is positively amazing.    There is a widespread belief even at the present day that Islam was a  complete novelty and that the religion and culture of the Muhammedan  world were wholly alien to Western medievalism. Such views are  entirely false; during the Middle Ages Muhammedanism and Western  culture were inspired by the same spirit. The fact has been obscured  by the contrast between the two religions whose differences have been  constantly exaggerated and by dissimilarities of language and  nationality. To retrace in full detail the close connection which  unites Christianity and Islam would be the work of years. Within the  scope of the present volume, all that can be done is to explain the  points of contact between Christian and Muhammedan theories of life  and religion. Such is the object of the following pages. We shall  first treat of Muhammed personally, because his rise as a religious  force will explain the possibility of later developments.    This statement also explains the sense in which we shall use the term  Christianity. Muhammedanism has no connection with post-Reformation  Christianity and meets it only in the mission field. Practical  questions there arise which lie beyond the limits of our subject, as  we have already indicated. Our interests are concerned with the  mediaeval Church, when Christianity first imposed its ideas upon  Muhammedanism at the time of its rise in the East, and afterwards  received a material extension of its own horizon through the rapid  progress of its protege. Our task is to analyse and explain these  special relations between the two systems of thought.    The religion now known as Islam is as near to the preaching of  Muhammed or as remote from it, as modern Catholicism or Protestant  Christianity is at variance or in harmony with the teaching of Jesus.  The simple beliefs of the prophet and his contemporaries are separated  by a long course of development from the complicated religious system  in its unity and diversity which Islam now presents to us. The course  of this development was greatly influenced by Christianity, but  Christian ideas had been operative upon Muhammed's eager intellectual  life at an even earlier date. We must"]]]
