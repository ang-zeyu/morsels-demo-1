He would think more of making it reflect  the odd personality of the man than rehearse the birth, development,  daily life, and works of the author. If he had undertaken to write his  own life, as was once his intention, it would probably have been the  most remarkable work of fiction by an American author that ever  masqueraded in the quaker garments of fact. From title-page to  colophon--on which he would have insisted--the book would have been  one studied effort to quiz and queer (a favorite word of his) the  innocent and willing-to-be-deluded reader. \"Tell your sister for me,\"  I recall his saying, \"what a kind, good, and deserving man I am. How I  love little children and [with a dry chuckle] elderly spinsters.  Relate how I was born of rich yet honest parents, was reared in the  'nurture and admonition of the Lord,' and, according to the bent of a  froward youth, have stumbled along to become the cynosure of a ribald  age.\"    Field's idea of a perfect memoir was that it should contain no facts  that might interfere with its being novel and interesting reading both  to the public and its subject. He set little store by genius, as he  tells us in one of his letters, and less by \"that nonsense called  useful knowledge.\" His peculiar notions as to the field of biography  were once illustrated in one he furnished to a New York firm, which  proposed a series of biographies of well-known newspaper writers. It  was arranged that Field and William E. Curtis, the noted Washington  correspondent, should write each the other's biography for the series.  Mr. Curtis executed his sketch of Field in good faith; Field's sketch  of Mr. Curtis was a marvel of waggish invention. Through an actor of  the same name who some years before made quite a reputation as Samuel  of Posen, he traced Mr. Curtis's birth back to Bohemia, and carried  him at an early age to Jerusalem, where Curtis was said to have laid  the foundations of his fame and fortune peddling suspenders. Later he  sold newspapers on the streets, and, by practicing the shrewd and  self-denying habits of his race, quickly became the owner of the paper  for which he worked, which was called the New Jerusalem Messenger, the  recognized organ of the New Jerusalem Church.    Mr. Curtis's progressive tendencies, according to Field, quickly  involved him in trouble with the government; his paper was suppressed,  and he was banished from Jerusalem. When the special firmin of the  Sultan expelling Mr. Curtis from Turkish dominions was published, it  caused a great sensation in Chicago, where the Church of the New  Jerusalem was very strong, and created an immediate rivalry between  William Penn Nixon, editor of the Inter Ocean, and Melville E. Stone,  editor of the Morning News, to secure his services. Mr. Nixon sent him  a cablegram in Hebrew which was written by a Hebrew gentleman to whom  Nixon sold old clothes, while Mr. Stone's cablegram was prepared by  his father, the Rev. Mr. Stone, and was expressed in scriptural  phraseology which was not understood in Jerusalem as well as it was at  Galesburg, where Mr. Stone was then professor of the Hebrew language  and literature. Curtis accepted the offer couched in the language of  the Hebrew vender of old clothes and became a member of the editorial  staff of the Inter Ocean. His first effective work on that newspaper  was to convert Jonathan Young Scammon, then its owner, to the New  Jerusalem faith (Mr. Scammon, whose real name was John, was the most  prominent Swedenborgian in Chicago). Mr. Scammon was so grateful for  his conversion from infidelity that in a moment of religious  exaltation he raised Mr. Curtis's salary from $18 to $20.    And thus the biography of Mr. Curtis proceeded along lines that gave  the truth a wide berth, for Field held, with the old English jurists,  that the greater the truth the greater the libel.    At one time in our association Field, as seriously as he could,  entertained the thought of furnishing me with materials for an  extended sketch of his life, and I still have several envelopes on  which the inscription \"For My Memoirs\" bears witness to that purpose.  But after serving as a source of eccentric and roguish humor for  several months, the idea was suffered to lapse, only to be revived in  suggestive references as he consigned some bit of manuscript to my  care or criticism. Any study of Field's life and character based on  such materials as he thus furnished would have been absolutely  misleading. It would have eliminated fact entirely and substituted the  most fantastic fiction in its stead. It would have built up a  grotesque caricature of a staid, church-going, circumspect citizen and  author instead of the ever-fascinating bundle of contradictions and  irresponsibility Field was to his legion of associates and friends.    There were two Fields--the author and the man--and it is the purpose  of this study to reproduce the latter as he appeared to those who knew  and loved him for what he was personally for the benefit of those who  have only known him through the medium of his writings. In doing this  it is far from my intention and farther from my friendship to disturb  any of the preconceptions that have been formed from the perusal of  his works. These are the creations of something entirely apart from  the man whose genius produced them. His fame as an author rests on his  printed books, and will endure as surely as the basis of his art was  true, his methods severely simple, and his spirit gentle and pure. In  his daily work the dominant note was that of fun and conviviality. It  was free from the acrimony of controversy. He abominated speech-makers  and lampooned political oracles. He was the unsparing satirist of  contemporary pretense, which in itself was sufficient to account for  the failure of the passing generation of literary critics to accord to  him the recognition which he finally won in their despite from the  reading public. Neither a sinner nor a saint was the man who went into  an old book-store in Chicago and bewildered the matter-of-fact dealer  in old editions with the inquiry, \"Have you an unexpurgated copy of  Hannah More's 'Letters to a Village Maiden'?\"    Everything Field wrote in prose or verse reflects his contempt for  earth's mighty and his sympathy for earth's million mites. His art,  like that of his favorite author and prototype, Father Prout, was \"to  magnify what is little and fling a dash of the sublime into a  two-penny post communication.\" Sense of earthly grandeur he had little  or none. Sense of the minor sympathies of life--those minor sympathies  that are common to all and finally swell into the major song of  life--of this sense he was compact. It was the meat and marrow of his  life and mind, of his song and story. With unerring instinct Field, in  his study of humanity, went to the one school where the emotions,  wishes, and passions of mankind are to be seen unobscured by the veil  of consciousness. He was forever scanning whatever lies hidden within  the folds of the heart of childhood. He knew children through and  through because he studied them from themselves and not from books. He  associated with them on terms of the most intimate comradeship and  wormed his way into their confidence with assiduous sympathy. Thus he  became possessed of the inmost secrets of their childish joys and  griefs and so became a literary philosopher of childhood.    \"In wit a man, in simplicity a child,\" nothing gloomy, narrow, or  pharisaical entered into the composition of Eugene Field. Like Jack  Montesquieu Bellew, the editor of the Cork Chronicle, \"his finances,  alas! were always miserably low.\" This followed from his learning how  to spend money freely before he was forced to earn it laboriously. He  scattered his patrimony gaily and then when the last inherited cent  was gone, turned with, equal gayety to earning, not only enough to  support himself, but the wife and family that, with the royal and  reckless prodigality of genius, he provided himself with at the very  outset of his career.    If he set \"no store by genius,\" he at least had that faith in his own  ability which \"compels the elements and wrings a human music from the  indifferent air.\" From the time he applied himself to the ill-requited  work of journalism he never wavered or turned aside in his purpose to  make it the ladder to literary recognition. He was over thirty before  he realized that in three universities he had slighted the opportunity  to acquire a thorough equipment for literary work. But he was  undismayed, for did he not read in his beloved \"Reliques of Father  Prout\" how \"Loyola, the founder of the most learned and by far the  most distinguished literary corporation that ever arose in the world,  was an old soldier who took up his 'Latin Grammar' when past the age  of thirty\"?    It is the contrast and apparent contradiction between the individual  and the author that makes the character of Eugene Field interesting to  the student. If the man were simply any prosaic person possessed of  the gift of telling tales, writing stories, and singing lullabies,  this study of his life would have been left unwritten. Many authors  have I known who put all there was of them into their work, who were  personally a disappointment to the intellect and a trial to the flesh.  With Eugene Field the man was always a bundle of delightful surprises,  an ever unconventional personality of which only the merest suggestion  is given in his works.

It was strong in his youth: it grew to be an imperative necessity in  later life. In the theory that it is sometimes good to be alone he had  little or no faith.\" From the time of Eugene's coming to Chicago until  my marriage, in 1887, I was his closest comrade and almost constant  companion. At the Daily News office, for a time, we shared the same  room and then the adjoining rooms of which I have spoken. Field was  known about the office as my \"habit,\" a relationship which gave point  to the touching appeal which served as introduction to the dearly  cherished manuscript copy, in two volumes, of nearly one hundred of  his poems, which was his wedding gift to Mrs. Thompson. It was  entitled, in red ink, \"Ye Piteous Complaynt of a Forsooken Habbit; a  Proper Sonet,\" and reads:      _Ye boone y aske is smalle indeede      Compared with what y once did seeke--    Soe, ladye, from yr. bounteous meede      Y pray you kyndly heere mee speke.    Still is yr. Slosson my supporte,      As once y was his soul's delite--    Holde hym not ever in yr. courte--      O lette me have hym pay-daye nite!      One nite per weeke is soothly not      Too oft to leese hym from yr. chaynes;    Thinke of my lorne impoverisht lotte      And eke my jelous panges and paynes;    Thinke of ye chekes y stille do owe--      Thinke of my quenchlesse appetite--    Thinke of my griffes and, thinking so,      Oh, lette me have hym pay-daye nite!_    Along the border of this soulful appeal was engrossed, in a woful  mixture of blue and purple inks: \"Ye habbit maketh mone over hys sore  griffe and mightylie beseacheth the ladye yt she graunt hym ye lone of  her hoosband on a pay-daye nite.\"    Through those years of comradeship we were practically inseparable  from the time he arrived at the office, an hour after me, until I bade  him good-night at the street-car or at his own door, when, according  to our pact, we walked and talked at his expense, instead of supping  late at mine. The nature of this pact is related in the following  verse, to which Field prefixed this note: \"While this poem is printed  in all the 'Reliques of Ye Good Knights' Poetrie,' and while the  incident it narrates is thoroughly characteristic of that Knightly  Sage, the versification is so different from that of the other ballads  that there is little doubt that this fragment is spurious. Prof. Max  Beeswanger (Book III., page 18, old English Poetry) says that these  verses were written by Friar Terence, a learned monk of the Good  Knight's time.\"      _THE GOOD KNIGHT TO SIR SLOSSON      The night was warm as summer      And the wold was wet with dew,        And the moon rose fair,        And the autumn air      From the flowery prairies blew;    You took my arm, ol' Nompy,      And measured the lonely street,        And you said, \"Let's walk        In the gloom and talk--      'Tis too pleasant to-night to eat!\"      And you quoth: \"Old Field supposin'      Hereafter we two agree;        If it's fair when we're through        I'm to walk with you--      If it's foul you're to eat with me!\"    Then I clasped your hand, ol' Nompy,      And I said: \"Well, be it so.\"        The night was so fine        I didn't opine      It could ever rain or snow!      But the change came on next morning      When the fickle mercury fell,        And since, that night        That was warm and bright      It's snowed or it's rained like--well.    Have you drawn your wages, Nompy?      Have you reckoned your pounds and pence?        Harsh blows the wind,        And I feel inclined      To banquet at your expense!_    The \"Friar Terence\" of Field's note was the Edward J. McPhelim to  whom reference has already been made, who often joined us in our  after-theatre symposiums, but could not be induced to walk one block  if there was a street-car going his way.    As bearing on the nature of these \"banquets,\" and the unending source  of enjoyment they were to both of us, the following may throw a  passing light:      _Discussing great and sumptuous cheer    At Boyle's one midnight dark and drear        Two gentle warriors sate;    Out spake old Field: \"In sooth I reck    We bide too long this night on deck--    What, ho there, varlet, bring the check!        Egad, it groweth late!\"      Then out spake Thompson flaming hot:    \"Now, by my faith, I fancy not,        Old Field, this ribald jest;    Though you are wondrous fair and free    With riches that accrue to thee,    The check to-night shall come to me--        You are my honored guest!\"      But with a dark forbidding frown    Field slowly pulled his visor down        And rose to go his way--    \"Since this sweet favor is denied,    I'll feast no more with thee,\" he cried--    Then strode he through the portal wide        While Thompson paused to pay._    Speaking of \"the riches that accrued\" to Field it may be well to  explain that when he came to Chicago from Denver he was burdened with  debts, and although subsequently he was in receipt of a fair salary,  it barely sufficed to meet his domestic expenses and left little to  abate the importunity of the claims that followed him remorselessly.
