TOYNBEE, D. MITRANY, D.G. HOGARTH          PREFACE      The authors of this volume have not worked in conjunction. Widely  separated, engaged on other duties, and pressed for time, we have had no  opportunity for interchange of views. Each must be held responsible,  therefore, for his own section alone. If there be any discrepancies in our  writings (it is not unlikely in so disputed a field of history) we can  only regret an unfortunate result of the circumstances. Owing to rapid  change in the relations of our country to the several Balkan peoples, the  tone of a section written earlier may differ from that of another written  later. It may be well to state that the sections on Serbia and Bulgaria  were finished before the decisive Balkan developments of the past two  months. Those on Greece and Rumania represent only a little later stage of  the evolution. That on Turkey, compiled between one mission abroad and  another, was the latest to be finished.    If our sympathies are not all the same, or given equally to friends and  foes, none of us would find it possible to indite a Hymn of Hate about any  Balkan people. Every one of these peoples, on whatever side he be fighting  to-day, has a past worthy of more than our respect and interwoven in some  intimate way with our history. That any one of them is arrayed against us  to-day is not to be laid entirely or chiefly at its own door. They are all  fine peoples who have not obtained their proper places in the sun. The  best of the Osmanli nation, the Anatolian peasantry, has yet to make its  physical and moral qualities felt under civilized conditions. As for the  rest--the Serbs and the Bulgars, who have enjoyed brief moments of  barbaric glory in their past, have still to find themselves in that future  which shall be to the Slav. The Greeks, who were old when we were not as  yet, are younger now than we. They are as incalculable a factor in a  political forecast as another Chosen Race, the Jews. Their past is the  world's glory: the present in the Near East is theirs more than any  people's: the future--despite the laws of corporate being and decline,  dare we say they will have no part in it? Of Rumania what are we to think?  Her mixed people has had the start of the Balkan Slavs in modern  civilization, and evidently her boundaries must grow wider yet. But the  limits of her possible expansion are easier to set than those of the rest.    We hope we have dealt fairly with all these peoples. Mediaeval history,  whether of the East or the West, is mostly a record of bloodshedding and  cruelty; and the Middle Age has been prolonged to our own time in most  parts of the Balkans, and is not yet over in some parts. There are certain  things salutary to bear in mind when we think or speak of any part of that  country to-day. First, that less than two hundred years ago, England had  its highwaymen on all roads, and its smuggler dens and caravans, Scotland  its caterans, and Ireland its moonlighters. Second, that religious fervour  has rarely mitigated and generally increased our own savagery. Thirdly,  that our own policy in Balkan matters has been none too wise, especially  of late. In permitting the Treaty of Bucarest three years ago, we were  parties to making much of the trouble that has ensued, and will ensue  again. If we have not been able to write about the Near East under  existing circumstances altogether _sine ira et studio_, we have tried to  remember that each of its peoples has a case.    D.G.

The other inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula  are, to the south of the Slavs, the Albanians in the west, the Greeks in  the centre and south, and the Turks in the south-east, and, to the north,  the Rumanians. All four of these nationalities are to be found in varying  quantities within the limits of the Slav territory roughly outlined above,  but greater numbers of them are outside it; on the other hand, there are a  considerable number of Serbs living north of the rivers Save and Danube,  in southern Hungary. Details of the ethnic distribution and boundaries  will of course be gone into more fully later; meanwhile attention may be  called to the significant fact that the name of Macedonia, the heart of  the Balkan peninsula, has been long used by the French gastronomers to  denote a dish, the principal characteristic of which is that its component  parts are mixed up into quite inextricable confusion.    Of the three Slavonic nationalities already mentioned, the two first, the  Bulgarians and the Serbo-Croats, occupy a much greater space,  geographically and historically, than the third. The Slovenes, barely one  and a half million in number, inhabiting the Austrian provinces of  Carinthia and Carniola, have never been able to form a political state,  though, with the growth of Trieste as a great port and the persistent  efforts of Germany to make her influence if not her flag supreme on the  shores of the Adriatic, this small people has from its geographical  position and from its anti-German (and anti-Italian) attitude achieved  considerable notoriety and some importance.    Of the Bulgars and Serbs it may be said that at the present moment the  former control the eastern, and the latter, in alliance with the Greeks,  the western half of the peninsula. It has always been the ambition of each  of these three nationalities to dominate the whole, an ambition which has  caused endless waste of blood and money and untold misery. If the question  were to be settled purely on ethnical considerations, Bulgaria would  acquire the greater part of the interior of Macedonia, the most numerous  of the dozen nationalities of which is Bulgarian in sentiment if not in  origin, and would thus undoubtedly attain the hegemony of the peninsula,  while the centre of gravity of the Serbian nation would, as is ethnically  just, move north-westwards. Political considerations, however, have until  now always been against this solution of the difficulty, and, even if it  solved in this sense, there would still remain the problem of the Greek  nationality, whose distribution along all the coasts of the Aegean, both  European and Asiatic, makes a delimitation of the Greek state on purely  ethnical lines virtually impossible. It is curious that the Slavs, though  masters of the interior of the peninsula and of parts of its eastern and  western coasts, have never made the shores of the Aegean (the White Sea,  as they call it) or the cities on them their own. The Adriatic is the only  sea on the shore of which any Slavonic race has ever made its home.

Frey    Author of    \"The Camp Fire Girls in the Maine Woods\",  \"The Camp Fire Girls at Onoway House\",  \"The Camp Fire Girls Go Motoring.\"    1916                CHAPTER I.      CHRONICLES IN COLOR.    \"Speaking of diaries,\" said Gladys Evans, \"what do you think of this for  one?\" She spread out a bead band, about an inch and a half wide and a  yard or more long, in which she had worked out in colors the main events  of her summer's camping trip with the Winnebago Camp Fire Girls. The  girls dropped their hand work and crowded around Gladys to get a better  look at the band, which told so cleverly the story of their wonderful  summer.    \"Oh, look,\" cried \"Sahwah\" Brewster, excitedly pointing out the figures,  \"there's Shadow River and the canoe floating upside down, and Ed Roberts  serenading Gladys--only it turned out to be Sherry serenading Nyoda--and  the Hike, and the Fourth of July pageant, and everything!\" The  Winnebagos were loud in their expressions of admiration, and the \"Don't  you remembers\" fell thick and fast as they recalled the events depicted  in the bead band.    It was a crisp evening in October and the Winnebagos were having their  Work Meeting at the Bradford house, as the guests of Dorothy Bradford,  or \"Hinpoha,\" as she was known in the Winnebago circle. Here were all  the girls we left standing on the boat dock at Loon Lake, looking just  the same as when we saw them last, a trifle less sunburned perhaps, but  just as full of life and spirit. Scissors, needles and crochet hooks  flew fast as the seven girls and their Guardian sat around the cheerful  wood fire in the library. Sahwah was tatting, Gladys and Migwan were  embroidering, and Miss Kent, familiarly known as \"Nyoda,\" the Guardian  of the Winnebago group, was \"mending her hole-proof hose,\" as she  laughingly expressed it. The three more quiet girls in the circle,  Nakwisi the Star Maiden, Chapa the Chipmunk, and Medmangi the Medicine  Man Girl, were working out their various symbols in crochet patterns.  Hinpoha was down on the floor popping corn over the glowing logs and  turning over a row of apples which had been set before the fireplace to  warm. The firelight streaming over her red curls made them shine like  burning embers, until it seemed as if some of the fire had escaped from  the grate and was playing around her face. Every few minutes she reached  out her hand and dealt a gentle slap on the nose of \"Mr. Bob,\" a young  cocker spaniel attached to the house of Bradford, who persistently tried  to take the apples in his mouth. Nyoda finally came to the rescue and  diverted his attention by giving him her darning egg to chew. The room  was filled with the light-hearted chatter of the girls. Sahwah was  relating with many giggles, how she had gotten into a scrape at school.    \"And old Professor Fuzzytop made me bring all my books and sit up at  that little table beside his desk for a week. Of course I didn't mind  that a bit, because then I could see what _everybody_ in the room was  doing instead of just the few around me. The only thing I prayed for was  that Miss Muggins wouldn't come in and see me, because she has taken a  sort of fancy to me and makes it easy for me in Latin, but if I ever  fall from grace she won't pass me. But of all the luck, right in the  middle of the Fourth Hour when everybody was in the room studying, in  she walked. I saw her as she opened the door and quick as a wink I  opened up the big dictionary on the table and buried my nose in it, so  she'd think I had gone up there of my own accord. She stopped and looked  at me, then patted me encouragingly on the shoulder and remarked what a  studious girl I was. I thought everybody in the room would die trying  not to laugh, but nobody gave me away. She came in during the Fourth  Hour for several days after that, and every time I flew to the  sheltering arms of the dictionary, and she always made some approving  remark out loud. Now she thinks I'm a shark and I have a better stand-in  than ever with her. She told her Senior session room that there was a  girl in the Junior room who was so keen after knowledge that no matter  when she came into the room she always found her consulting the  dictionary!\"    Sahwah's imitation of the elderly and precise Miss Muggins was so close  that the girls shrieked with laughter. Even Nyoda, who was a \"faculty,\"  and should have been the ally of the deluded instructor, was too much  amused to say a word. \"By the way, Sahwah,\" she said when the laughter  had died down, \"how are you coming on in Latin? The last time I saw you  your Cicero had a strangle hold on you.\" Sahwah made a fearful grimace,  and recited sarcastically:      \"Not showers to larks more pleasing,    Not sunshine to the bee,    Not sleep to toil more easing,    Than Latin prose to me!      \"The flocks shall leave the mountains,    The dew shall flee the rose,    The nymphs forsake the fountains,    Ere I forsake my prose!\"    Nyoda laughed and shook her head at Sahwah, and \"Migwan,\" otherwise  Elsie Gardiner, looked up at the despiser of prose composition in mild  wonderment. \"I don't see how you can make such a fuss about learning  Latin,\" she said, \"it's the least of my troubles.\"    \"But I'm not such a genius as you,\" answered Sahwah, \"and my head won't  stand the strain.\" Her mental limitations did not seem to cause her any  anxiety, however, for she hummed a merry tune as she drew her tatting  shuttle in and out.    Migwan leaned back in her chair and looked around the tastefully  furnished room with quiet enjoyment. This library in the Bradford house  was a never-ending delight to her. It was finished in dark oak and the  walls were hung with a rich brown paper. The floor was polished and  covered with oriental rugs, whose patterns she loved to trace. At one  end of the room was a big fireplace and on each side of it a cozy seat,  piled with tapestry covered cushions. Over the fireplace hung two  slender swords, the property of some departed Bradford. The handsome  chairs were upholstered in brown leather to match the other furnishings,  and everything in the room, from the Italian marble Psyche on its  pedestal in the corner to the softly glowing lamps, gave the impression  of wealth and culture. Migwan contrasted it with the shabby sitting room  in her own home and sighed. She was keenly responsive to beautiful  surroundings and would have been happy to stay forever in this library.  But beautiful as the furnishings were, they were the least part of the  attraction. The real drawing card were the books that filled the cases  on three sides of the room. There were books of every kind; fiction,  poetry, history, travel, science; and whole sets of books in handsome  bindings that Migwan fairly revelled in whenever she came to visit.  Hinpoha herself was not fond of reading anything but fiction, and  although she had the freedom of all the cases she never looked at  anything but \"story books.\" Before her parents went to Europe they had  tried making her keep an average of one book of fiction to one of  another kind in the hope of instilling into her a love for essays and  history, but in the absence of her father and mother, history and essays  were having a long vacation and fiction was working overtime.    \"Let's play something,\" said Sahwah when the apples and popcorn had  disappeared; \"I'm tired of sitting still.\"    \"Can't somebody please think of a new game?\" said Hinpoha. \"We've played  everything we know until I'm sick of it.\"    \"I thought of one the other day,\" said Gladys quietly. \"I named it the  'Camp Fire Game.' You play it like Stage Coach, or Fruit Basket, only  instead of taking parts of a coach or names of fruits you take articles  that belong to the Camp Fire, like bead band, ring, moccasin, bracelet,  fire, honor beads, symbol, fringe, Wohelo, hand sign, bow and drill,  Mystic Fire, etc. Then somebody tells a story about Camp Fire Girls, and  every time one of those articles is mentioned every one must get up and  turn around. But if the words 'Ceremonial Meeting' or 'Council Fire' are  mentioned, then all must change seats and the story teller tries to get  a seat in the scramble, and the one who gets left out has to go on with  the story.\"    \"Good!\" cried Nyoda, \"let's play it. You tell the story first.\"    Gladys stood up in the center of the room and began: \"Once upon a time  there were a group of Camp Fire Girls called the Winnebagos, and they  went to school in the Professors' big tepee on the avenue, where they  pursued knowledge for all they were worth. So much wisdom did they  imbibe that it was necessary to wear a head band to keep their heads  from splitting open. Wherever they went they were immediately recognized  by their rings and bracelets, and were pointed out as 'those dreadful  young savages.' The professors and teachers hoped every day that they  would not come to school, but they never stayed away because they  received honor beads from their Guardian Mother for not being absent.  Sometimes it seemed as if the tricks they did in class room could only  have been accomplished by their having consulted one another, and yet it  was impossible to catch them whispering in class because they always  conversed by hand signs. However, this also led to disaster one day when  one of our well-beloved sisters of the bow and drill tried to make the  hand sign for 'girl,' and raised her hand above her head. The Big Chief,  who was conducting the lesson, thought she wanted something, and said  benevolently: 'What is your desire?' Absent-mindedly she replied, 'It is  my desire to become a Camp Fire Girl and obey the Law of the Camp Fire,  which is to seek beauty, give service, pursue knowledge, be trustworthy,  hold on to health, glorify work, and be happy,' 'Begone,' said the Big  Chief, 'what do you think this is, a Ceremonial Meeting?'\""]]]
