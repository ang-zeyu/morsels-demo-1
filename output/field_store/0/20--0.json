THE END          THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER      CHAPTER I    THE FENCHURCH STREET MYSTERY      The man in the corner pushed aside his glass, and leant across the  table.    \"Mysteries!\" he commented. \"There is no such thing as a mystery in  connection with any crime, provided intelligence is brought to bear upon  its investigation.\"    Very much astonished Polly Burton looked over the top of her newspaper,  and fixed a pair of very severe, coldly inquiring brown eyes upon him.    She had disapproved of the man from the instant when he shuffled across  the shop and sat down opposite to her, at the same marble-topped table  which already held her large coffee (3d.), her roll and butter (2d.),  and plate of tongue (6d.).    Now this particular corner, this very same table, that special view of  the magnificent marble hall--known as the Norfolk Street branch of the  Aerated Bread Company's depots--were Polly's own corner, table, and  view. Here she had partaken of eleven pennyworth of luncheon and one  pennyworth of daily information ever since that glorious  never-to-be-forgotten day when she was enrolled on the staff of the  _Evening Observer_ (we'll call it that, if you please), and became a  member of that illustrious and world-famed organization known as the  British Press.    She was a personality, was Miss Burton of the _Evening Observer_. Her  cards were printed thus:    [Illustration: Miss MARY J. BURTON. _Evening Observer_.]    She had interviewed Miss Ellen Terry and the Bishop of Madagascar, Mr.  Seymour Hicks and the Chief Commissioner of Police. She had been present  at the last Marlborough House garden party--in the cloak-room, that is  to say, where she caught sight of Lady Thingummy's hat, Miss  What-you-may-call's sunshade, and of various other things modistical or  fashionable, all of which were duly described under the heading \"Royalty  and Dress\" in the early afternoon edition of the _Evening Observer_.    (The article itself is signed M.J.B., and is to be found in the files of  that leading halfpennyworth.)    For these reasons--and for various others, too--Polly felt irate with  the man in the corner, and told him so with her eyes, as plainly as any  pair of brown eyes can speak.    She had been reading an article in the _Daily Telegraph_. The article  was palpitatingly interesting. Had Polly been commenting audibly upon  it? Certain it is that the man over there had spoken in direct answer to  her thoughts.    She looked at him and frowned; the next moment she smiled. Miss Burton  (of the _Evening Observer)_ had a keen sense of humour, which two years'  association with the British Press had not succeeded in destroying, and  the appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultra-morose  fancy. Polly thought to herself that she had never seen any one so pale,  so thin, with such funny light-coloured hair, brushed very smoothly  across the top of a very obviously bald crown. He looked so timid and  nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string; his long,  lean, and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful  and complicated proportions.    Having carefully studied every detail of the quaint personality Polly  felt more amiable.    \"And yet,\" she remarked kindly but authoritatively, \"this article, in an  otherwise well-informed journal, will tell you that, even within the  last year, no fewer than six crimes have completely baffled the police,  and the perpetrators of them are still at large.\"    \"Pardon me,\" he said gently, \"I never for a moment ventured to suggest  that there were no mysteries to the _police_; I merely remarked that  there were none where intelligence was brought to bear upon the  investigation of crime.\"    \"Not even in the Fenchurch Street _mystery_. I suppose,\" she asked  sarcastically.    \"Least of all in the so-called Fenchurch Street _mystery_,\" he replied  quietly.    Now the Fenchurch Street mystery, as that extraordinary crime had  popularly been called, had puzzled--as Polly well knew--the brains of  every thinking man and woman for the last twelve months. It had puzzled  her not inconsiderably; she had been interested, fascinated; she had  studied the case, formed her own theories, thought about it all often  and often, had even written one or two letters to the Press on the  subject--suggesting, arguing, hinting at possibilities and  probabilities, adducing proofs which other amateur detectives were  equally ready to refute. The attitude of that timid man in the corner,  therefore, was peculiarly exasperating, and she retorted with sarcasm  destined to completely annihilate her self-complacent interlocutor.    \"What a pity it is, in that case, that you do not offer your priceless  services to our misguided though well-meaning police.\"    \"Isn't it?\" he replied with perfect good-humour. \"Well, you know, for  one thing I doubt if they would accept them; and in the second place my  inclinations and my duty would--were I to become an active member of the  detective force--nearly always be in direct conflict. As often as not my  sympathies go to the criminal who is clever and astute enough to lead  our entire police force by the nose.    \"I don't know how much of the case you remember,\" he went on quietly.  \"It certainly, at first, began even to puzzle me. On the 12th of last  December a woman, poorly dressed, but with an unmistakable air of having  seen better days, gave information at Scotland Yard of the disappearance  of her husband, William Kershaw, of no occupation, and apparently of no  fixed abode. She was accompanied by a friend--a fat, oily-looking  German--and between them they told a tale which set the police  immediately on the move.    \"It appears that on the 10th of December, at about three o'clock in the  afternoon, Karl Mueller, the German, called on his friend, William  Kershaw, for the purpose of collecting a small debt--some ten pounds or  so--which the latter owed him. On arriving at the squalid lodging in  Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, he found William Kershaw in a wild  state of excitement, and his wife in tears. Mueller attempted to state  the object of his visit, but Kershaw, with wild gestures, waved him  aside, and--in his own words--flabbergasted him by asking him  point-blank for another loan of two pounds, which sum, he declared,  would be the means of a speedy fortune for himself and the friend who  would help him in his need.    \"After a quarter of an hour spent in obscure hints, Kershaw, finding the  cautious German obdurate, decided to let him into the secret plan,  which, he averred, would place thousands into their hands.\"    Instinctively Polly had put down her paper; the mild stranger, with his  nervous air and timid, watery eyes, had a peculiar way of telling his  tale, which somehow fascinated her.    \"I don't know,\" he resumed, \"if you remember the story which the German  told to the police, and which was corroborated in every detail by the  wife or widow. Briefly it was this: Some thirty years previously,  Kershaw, then twenty years of age, and a medical student at one of the  London hospitals, had a chum named Barker, with whom he roomed,  together with another.    \"The latter, so it appears, brought home one evening a very considerable  sum of money, which he had won on the turf, and the following morning he  was found murdered in his bed. Kershaw, fortunately for himself, was  able to prove a conclusive _alibi_; he had spent the night on duty at  the hospital; as for Barker, he had disappeared, that is to say, as far  as the police were concerned, but not as far as the watchful eyes of his  friend Kershaw were able to spy--at least, so the latter said. Barker  very cleverly contrived to get away out of the country, and, after  sundry vicissitudes, finally settled down at Vladivostok, in Eastern  Siberia, where, under the assumed name of Smethurst, he built up an  enormous fortune by trading in furs.    \"Now, mind you, every one knows Smethurst, the Siberian millionaire.  Kershaw's story that he had once been called Barker, and had committed a  murder thirty years ago, was never proved, was it? I am merely telling  you what Kershaw said to his friend the German and to his wife on that  memorable afternoon of December the 10th.    \"According to him Smethurst had made one gigantic mistake in his clever  career--he had on four occasions written to his late friend, William  Kershaw. Two of these letters had no bearing on the case, since they  were written more than twenty-five years ago, and Kershaw, moreover, had  lost them--so he said--long ago."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note:         Like much 18th and 19th century publishing, the edition of       David Hume's \"History of England\" from which this text was       prepared makes extensive use of both footnotes and marginal       notes.  Since this e-text format does not allow use of the       original superscripts to denote the lettered footnotes, they       are indicated by the relevant letter within brackets, thus       \"[a]\", and the footnotes themselves are reproduced within       brackets and preceded by \"FN\" at the end of the PARAGRAPH to       which they relate; since some of Hume's paragraphs are       considerably longer than is normal in 21st century American or       British writing, you may have to scroll some distance to find       the text of the footnote.  All footnotes are reproduced       exactly as in the printed text.         More discretion has been exercised regarding marginal notes.       Those which simply repeat chapter numbers and dates already       given in the text are omitted as non-essential clutter.  The       remainder are reproduced within brackets and preceded by \"MN\".       Those marginal notes which appear to correspond to sub-chapter       headings are reproduced as the first line of the paragraph to       which they relate.  Other marginal notes are reproduced within       the text of the paragraph.  Some apparently incomplete       marginal notes ending or beginning with ellipses are due to       cases where what is logically a single marginal note has been       broken into two or more pieces separated by a considerable       vertical distance.          THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND, VOLUME I    From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688    by    DAVID HUME, ESQ.    With the Author's Last Corrections and Improvements, to which is  prefixed a Short Account of His Life Written by Himself        COMPLETE IN SIX VOLUMES                MY OWN LIFE.    It is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity;  therefore I shall be short.  It may be thought an instance of vanity  that I pretend at all to write my life; but this narrative shall  contain little more than the history of my writings; as, indeed,  almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and  occupations.  The first success of most of my writings was not such as  to be an object of vanity.    I was born the 26th of April, 1711, old style, at Edinburgh.  I was of  a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a  branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been  proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses, for several  generations.  My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President  of the College of Justice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by  succession to her brother.    My family, however, was not rich; and being myself a younger brother,  my patrimony, according to the mode of my country, was of course very  slender.  My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an  infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the care  of our mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and  handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her  children.  I passed through the ordinary course of education with  success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature,  which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of  my enjoyments.  My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my industry,  gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me;  but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits  of philosophy and general learning; and while they fancied I was  poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which  I was secretly devouring.    My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this plan of  life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I  was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for  entering into a more active scene of life.  In 1734 I went to Bristol,  with some recommendations to several merchants; but in a few months  found that scene totally unsuitable to me.  I went over to France with  a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there  laid that plan of life which I have steadily and successfully pursued.  I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of  fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every  object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in  literature.    During my retreat in France, first at Rheims but chiefly at La Fleche,  in Anjou, I composed my Treatise of Human Nature.  After passing three  years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in  1737.  In the end of 1738 I published my Treatise, and immediately went down  to my mother and my brother, who lived at his country-house, and  employed himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement  of his fortune.    Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human  Nature.  It fell DEAD-BORN FROM THE PRESS, without reaching such  distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.  But being  naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I very soon recovered the  blow, and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.  In  1742 I printed at Edinburgh the first part of my Essays: the work was  favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former  disappointment.  I continued with my mother and brother in the  country, and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek  language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.    In 1745 I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me  to come and live with him in England; I found, also, that the friends  and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under  my care and direction, for the state of his mind and health required  it.--I lived with him a twelve-month.  My appointments during that  time made a considerable accession to my small fortune.  I then  received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a  secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada,  but ended in an incursion on the coast of France.  Next year, to wit,  1747, I received an invitation from the general to attend him in the  same station in his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and  Turin.  I then wore the uniform of an  officer, and was introduced at  these courts as aide-de-camp to the general, along with Sir Harry  Erskine and Captain Grant, now General Grant.  These two years were  almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during  the course of my life: I passed them agreeably and in good company;  and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune  which I called independent, though most of my friends were inclined to  smile when I said so: in short, I was now master of near a thousand  pounds.    I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in  publishing the Treatise of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the  manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual  indiscretion, in going to the press too early.  I therefore cast the  first part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human  Understanding, which was published while I was at Turin.  But this  piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human  Nature.  On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all  England in a ferment, on account of Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry,  while my performance was entirely over-looked and neglected.  A new  edition which had been published in London, of my Essays, moral and  political, met not with a much better reception.    Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made  little or no impression on me.  I went down in 1749, and lived two  years with my brother at his country-house, for my mother was now  dead.  I there composed the second part of my Essay, which I called  Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of  Morals, which is another part of my treatise that I cast anew.  Meanwhile my bookseller, A. Miller, informed me that my former  publications (all but the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be  the subject of conversation; that the sale of them was gradually  increasing; and that new editions were demanded.  Answers by Reverends  and Right Reverends came out two or three in a year; and I found, by  Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed  in good company.  However, I had a fixed resolution, which I  inflexibly maintained, never to reply to any body; and not being very  irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all  literary squabbles.  These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me  encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than  the unfavourable side of things; a turn of mind which it is more happy  to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year.    In 1751 I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a  man of letters.  In 1752 were published at Edinburgh, where I then  lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was  successful on the first publication.  It was well received at home and  abroad.  In the same year was published, in London, my Enquiry  concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion, (who  ought not to judge on that subject,) is of all my writings,  historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.  It  came unnoticed and unobserved into the world.    In 1752 the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian; an office  from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the  command of a large library.  I then formed the plan of writing the  History of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing  a narrative"]]]
