INTRODUCTION    It would seem fitting for a Northern folk, deriving the greater and  better part of their speech, laws, and customs from a Northern root,  that the North should be to them, if not a holy land, yet at least  a place more to be regarded than any part of the world beside; that  howsoever their knowledge widened of other men, the faith and deeds of  their forefathers would never lack interest for them, but would always  be kept in remembrance. One cause after another has, however, aided  in turning attention to classic men and lands at the cost of our own  history. Among battles, \"every schoolboy\" knows the story of Marathon  or Salamis, while it would be hard indeed to find one who did more than  recognise the name, if even that, of the great fights of Hafrsfirth or  Sticklestead. The language and history of Greece and Rome, their laws  and religions, have been always held part of the learning needful to an  educated man, but no trouble has been taken to make him familiar with  his own people or their tongue. Even that Englishman who knew Alfred,  Bede, Caedmon, as well as he knew Plato, Caesar, Cicero, or Pericles,  would be hard bestead were he asked about the great peoples from whom  we sprang; the warring of Harold Fairhair or Saint Olaf; the Viking  (1) kingdoms in these (the British) Western Isles; the settlement of  Iceland, or even of Normandy. The knowledge of all these things would  now be even smaller than it is among us were it not that there was one  land left where the olden learning found refuge and was kept in being.  In England, Germany, and the rest of Europe, what is left of the  traditions of pagan times has been altered in a thousand ways by foreign  influence, even as the peoples and their speech have been by the influx  of foreign blood; but Iceland held to the old tongue that was once the  universal speech of northern folk, and held also the great stores of  tale and poem that are slowly becoming once more the common heritage of  their descendants. The truth, care, and literary beauty of its records;  the varied and strong life shown alike in tale and history; and the  preservation of the old speech, character, and tradition--a people  placed apart as the Icelanders have been--combine to make valuable what  Iceland holds for us. Not before 1770, when Bishop Percy translated  Mallet's \"Northern Antiquities\", was anything known here of Icelandic,  or its literature. Only within the latter part of this century has it  been studied, and in the brief book-list at the end of this volume may  be seen the little that has been done as yet. It is, however, becoming  ever clearer, and to an increasing number, how supremely important is  Icelandic as a word-hoard to the English-speaking peoples, and that in  its legend, song, and story there is a very mine of noble and pleasant  beauty and high manhood. That which has been done, one may hope, is but  the beginning of a great new birth, that shall give back to our language  and literature all that heedlessness and ignorance bid fair for awhile  to destroy.    The Scando-Gothic peoples who poured southward and westward over  Europe, to shake empires and found kingdoms, to meet Greek and Roman  in conflict, and levy tribute everywhere, had kept up their  constantly-recruited waves of incursion, until they had raised a barrier  of their own blood. It was their own kin, the sons of earlier  invaders, who stayed the landward march of the Northmen in the time of  Charlemagne. To the Southlands their road by land was henceforth closed.  Then begins the day of the Vikings, who, for two hundred years and more,  \"held the world at ransom.\" Under many and brave leaders they first  of all came round the \"Western Isles\" (2) toward the end of the eighth  century; soon after they invaded Normandy, and harried the coasts of  France; gradually they lengthened their voyages until there was no shore  of the then known world upon which they were unseen or unfelt. A glance  at English history will show the large part of it they fill, and how  they took tribute from the Anglo-Saxons, who, by the way, were far  nearer kin to them than is usually thought. In Ireland, where the old  civilisation was falling to pieces, they founded kingdoms at Limerick  and Dublin among other places; (3) the last named, of which the first  king, Olaf the White, was traditionally descended of Sigurd the Volsung,  (4) endured even to the English invasion, when it was taken by men of  the same Viking blood a little altered. What effect they produced  upon the natives may be seen from the description given by the unknown  historian of the \"Wars of the Gaedhil with the Gaill\": \"In a word,  although there were an hundred hard-steeled iron heads on one neck,  and an hundred sharp, ready, cool, never-rusting brazen tongues in each  head, and an hundred garrulous, loud, unceasing voices from each tongue,  they could not recount, or narrate, or enumerate, or tell what all the  Gaedhil suffered in common--both men and women, laity and clergy,  old and young, noble and ignoble--of hardship, and of injury, and of  oppression, in every house, from these valiant, wrathful, purely pagan  people. Even though great were this cruelty, oppression, and tyranny,  though numerous were the oft-victorious clans of the many-familied  Erinn; though numerous their kings, and their royal chiefs, and their  princes; though numerous their heroes and champions, and their brave  soldiers, their chiefs of valour and renown and deeds of arms; yet not  one of them was able to give relief, alleviation, or deliverance from  that oppression and tyranny, from the numbers and multitudes, and  the cruelty and the wrath of the brutal, ferocious, furious, untamed,  implacable hordes by whom that oppression was inflicted, because of the  excellence of their polished, ample, treble, heavy, trusty, glittering  corslets; and their hard, strong, valiant swords; and their well-riveted  long spears, and their ready, brilliant arms of valour besides; and  because of the greatness of their achievements and of their deeds, their  bravery, and their valour, their strength, and their venom, and their  ferocity, and because of the excess of their thirst and their hunger for  the brave, fruitful, nobly-inhabited, full of cataracts, rivers, bays,  pure, smooth-plained, sweet grassy land of Erinn\"--(pp. 52-53). Some  part of this, however, must be abated, because the chronicler is  exalting the terror-striking enemy that he may still further exalt his  own people, the Dal Cais, who did so much under Brian Boroimhe to check  the inroads of the Northmen. When a book does (5) appear, which has  been announced these ten years past, we shall have more material for  the reconstruction of the life of those times than is now anywhere  accessible. Viking earldoms also were the Orkneys, Faroes, and  Shetlands. So late as 1171, in the reign of Henry II., the year after  Beckett's murder, Earl Sweyn Asleifsson of Orkney, who had long been the  terror of the western seas, \"fared a sea-roving\" and scoured the western  coast of England, Man, and the east of Ireland, but was killed in an  attack on his kinsmen of Dublin. He had used to go upon a regular plan  that may be taken as typical of the homely manner of most of his like  in their cruising: \"Sweyn had in the spring hard work, and made them  lay down very much seed, and looked much after it himself. But when  that toil was ended, he fared away every spring on a viking-voyage, and  harried about among the southern isles and Ireland, and came home after  midsummer. That he called spring-viking. Then he was at home until the  corn-fields were reaped down, and the grain seen to and stored. Then  he fared away on a viking-voyage, and then he did not come home till the  winter was one month off, and that he called his autumn-viking.\" (6)    Toward the end of the ninth century Harold Fairhair, either spurred  by the example of Charlemagne, or really prompted, as Snorri Sturluson  tells us, resolved to bring all Norway under him. As Snorri has it in  \"Heimskringla\": \"King Harold sent his men to a girl hight Gyda.... The  king wanted her for his leman; for she was wondrous beautiful but of  high mood withal. Now when the messengers came there and gave their  message to her, she made answer that she would not throw herself away  even to take a king for her husband, who swayed no greater kingdom than  a few districts; 'And methinks,' said she, 'it is a marvel that no king  here in Norway will put all the land under him, after the fashion that  Gorm the Old did in Denmark, or Eric at Upsala.' The messengers deemed  this a dreadfully proud-spoken answer, and asked her what she thought  would come of such an one, for Harold was so mighty a man that his  asking was good enough for her. But although she had replied to their  saying otherwise than they would, they saw no likelihood, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#1)"],[1,"PRESS***      Copyright (C) 2003 by the individual authors        Behind The News: Voices From Goa's Press      Copyleft, 2003.

An  e-book, written collaboratively by over a  dozen-and-half journalists, many with amazing stories  to tell. Their willingness to do so, says something.    For one, it indicates a generosity to convert memories  into history, which would otherwise have been consigned  to the dustbin of amnesia. This is particularly true,  as the media seldom writes critically about themselves  in Goa. More importantly, it also suggests that there  are many in Goa who have a story, and are willing to  narrate it. If only they're given a chance. As  mediapersons, we need to ask ourselves why these  stories are not allowed (or encouraged) to surface in  the first place. It's impossible to believe that there  is such a drought of ideas and issues in Goa, and the  general lack of debate in the media would make it seem.    October 10, 2003 marks the 20th anniversary of the  Herald's English-language edition. Many of us  journalists who contributed here are no longer, or  perhaps never were, associated with that daily  newspaper. But, the launch of this product undeniably  opened up avenues for a generation of journalists in  the state. In addition, it rewrote the rules of  journalism for all of us here, for better or worse.  Hence the choice of this date for the first release of  this book.    What is being said along these e-pages refers to  critical times in the history of post-1961 Goa.  Needless to say, views voiced here stem from personal  experiences, oftentimes are subjective, and likely to  generate even more debate. But personal viewpoints are  also important, in that these help to complete our  understanding of particular events, episodes, and  individuals. It is no coincidence perhaps that this  series of essays is critical of some held up as icons  of Goa's journalism over the past four decades. You  might feel the criticism is unfair; but other versions  do need to be heard.    This is, of course, not the last word on the subject.  Nor does it claim to be a comprehensive account -- what  got included depended on who was willing to write their  'story' when the call for chapters went out.    This unusual work is humbly devoted to those who are  not, or cannot, be with us, as we go down the corridors  of time and look at the past decades. Journalists whom  Goa has produced, but perhaps were never adequately  recognised over the years. Like the innovative Ivan  Fera, who died young along with the promise of immense  talent and many bylines in journals like The  Illustrated Weekly. Or, Norman Dantas, who's early  death was at least in part triggered off by despair  brought on by the unfair deal he got from journalism in  Goa. We need to also remember the many who are not here  with us, pushed out -- both by limited opportunities,  as also politics in the press -- to migrate far and  wide and earn a living on distant shores. To all of  them, and the unsung heroes of journalism of the  post-Liberation era, this e-book is devoted.      Chapter 1:  Sixties' stories: Free Goa's first elections    By Ben AntaoBesides his stint referred to in this chapter, Benedito  Martinho Herculano Antao (b, 1935) worked for the  Indian Express in Bombay (1965-66). He then won a  journalism award from the World Press Institute, moved  to the US for a year's study, work and travel. Later,  he spent 10 weeks at the Denver Post (1967), worked for  a Catholic weekly in Toronto, and was a copy editor in  the mid-seventies at a major Toronto daily. He also  taught high school English, drama and religion for 22  years, before retiring in 1998, and qualified as a  certified financial planner in 1988. Currently, he is  involved in fiction writing, for which purpose he sees  journalism as a \"great training ground\".    There is a truism in journalism that goes like this:  facts are sacred; comment is free.    When I first read it in one of the books on journalism  that I borrowed from the USIS library in Bombay in the  late 'fifties, I was filled with such fervor as to  consider the vocation in journalism that I was  contemplating on, at the time, akin to the priesthood.  The concept of 'freedom of the press' particularly  attracted and engaged my young mind, burning with  idealism to bring about genuine equality in Indian  society and to see us as a truly \"honorable people\" as  the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had said we were.    In other words, journalism would offer me a platform to  make a difference.    After a season of doing freelance sports reporting for  The Indian Express in the city now called Mumbai, I  felt much like a lover. One who is not content with  merely kissing but wants to explore the whole body. And  as a follower of another truism, namely, he who seeks  finds the way, lucky circumstance fell into my lap and  I found myself doing freelance work for the Goan Tribune,  a fortnightly published in Bombay to espouse the  cause of Goa's political freedom from the Portuguese rule.    Here I got the opportunity not only to write about  sports, but also to do general news reporting and  profiles of prominent Goans. In little over a year,  though, my budding love affair discovered a flaw in my  inamorata -- the lady fancied the use of hyperbole and  propaganda as legitimate means to promote herself. My  idealism received a jolt of reality when Lambert Mascarenhas,  editor of the periodical then, engaged in  propagandist campaigning, suggesting that such slanted  writing was necessary to achieve the end. However, my  burning desire to express myself in writing overruled  my squeamishness.    After the Liberation of Goa in 1961, Lambert went to  Goa and became joint editor of a new English-language  daily, The Navhind Times, owned and published by the  Dempo Brothers, who had become wealthy in the mining  business. My fascination for the mistress of journalism  remained still intact, not to mention the hidden agenda  of my wanting to change the world.    So I went to Goa and joined the paper in June 1963.    Considering myself as a protege of Lambert, I enjoyed a  special status at the paper, doing both reporting and  sub-editing. It didn't take me long, though, to notice  that Vassantrao Dempo, the elder brother, was keenly  interested in the image of his newspaper and its  editorials. He had hired two editors, a Catholic and a  Hindu named T. V. Parvate from Maharashtra, ostensibly  to give balance to the paper's news and views. Often at  around 5:30 p.m., I would see Mr. Dempo carefully  perusing the editorial that Lambert or Parvate had  written before it came to the newsroom. The editors  wrote on alternate days. I would know, for example,  that Dempo had suggested a change in how a certain  point of view was expressed in Lambert's editorial  because Lambert often invited me to sit across his desk  while he wrote an editorial that was based on my news  report. Mr. Parvate, a fast and fluent writer, only  occasionally asked me into his partitioned office to  verify a fact or a figure.    Naturally, my curiosity propelled me to ask Lambert why  it was necessary for him or Parvate to have their  editorials okayed by the ultimate boss. After all, both  of them were professionals who knew and understood the  law of libel and defamation. Lambert, flashing his  customary smile by way of indulging me, a novice in the  game of politics, said it was a condition of his  contract. Besides, what was the big deal? An editor  could just as well express his own viewpoint as that of  the owner. It wasn't a loss of freedom. We live and let live.     Reporters too    I thought about it and gradually came to the conclusion  that reporters also indulged in self-censorship. Facts  may appear to be sacred, but as a reporter I choose  them to slant a 'story' in a particular way. Moreover,  space in a newspaper is always limited, forcing me to  write to a certain word"]]]
