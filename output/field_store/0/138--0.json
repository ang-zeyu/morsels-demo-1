THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE          It fell on a day I was happy,        And the winds, the concave sky,      The flowers and the beasts in the meadow        Seemed happy even as I;      And I stretched my hands to the meadow,        To the bird, the beast, the tree:      \"Why are ye all so happy?\"        I cried, and they answered me.        What sayest thou, Oh meadow,        That stretches so wide, so far,      That none can say how many        Thy misty marguerites are?      And what say ye, red roses,        That o'er the sun-blanched wall      From your high black-shadowed trellis        Like flame or blood-drops fall?          \"We are born, we are reared, and we linger            A various space and die;          We dream, and are bright and happy,            But we cannot answer why.\"        What sayest thou, Oh shadow,        That from the dreaming hill      All down the broadening valley        Liest so sharp and still?      And thou, Oh murmuring brooklet,        Whereby in the noonday gleam      The loosestrife burns like ruby,        And the branched asters dream?          \"We are born, we are reared, and we linger            A various space and die;          We dream and are very happy,            But we cannot answer why.\"        And then of myself I questioned,        That like a ghost the while      Stood from me and calmly answered,        With slow and curious smile:      \"Thou art born as the flowers, and wilt linger        Thine own short space and die;      Thou dream'st and art strangely happy,        But thou canst not answer why.\"          GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW          March is slain; the keen winds fly;      Nothing more is thine to do;      April kisses thee good-bye;      Thou must haste and follow too;      Silent friend that guarded well      Withered things to make us glad,      Shyest friend that could not tell      Half the kindly thought he had.      Haste thee, speed thee, O kind snow;      Down the dripping valleys go,      From the fields and gleaming meadows,      Where the slaying hours behold thee,      From the forests whose slim shadows,      Brown and leafless cannot fold thee,      Through the cedar lands aflame      With gold light that cleaves and quivers,      Songs that winter may not tame,      Drone of pines and laugh of rivers.      May thy passing joyous be      To thy father, the great sea,      For the sun is getting stronger;      Earth hath need of thee no longer;      Go, kind snow, God-speed to thee!          APRIL IN THE HILLS          To-day the world is wide and fair      With sunny fields of lucid air,      And waters dancing everywhere;        The snow is almost gone;      The noon is builded high with light,      And over heaven's liquid height,      In steady fleets serene and white,        The happy clouds go on.        The channels run, the bare earth steams,      And every hollow rings and gleams      With jetting falls and dashing streams;        The rivers burst and fill;      The fields are full of little lakes,      And when the romping wind awakes      The water ruffles blue and shakes,        And the pines roar on the hill.        The crows go by, a noisy throng;      About the meadows all day long      The shore-lark drops his brittle song;        And up the leafless tree      The nut-hatch runs, and nods, and clings;      The bluebird dips with flashing wings,      The robin flutes, the sparrow sings,        And the swallows float and flee.        I break the spirit's cloudy bands,      A wanderer in enchanted lands,      I feel the sun upon my hands;        And far from care and strife      The broad earth bids me forth. I rise      With lifted brow and upward eyes.      I bathe my spirit in blue skies,        And taste the springs of life.        I feel the tumult of new birth;      I waken with the wakening earth;      I match the bluebird in her mirth;        And wild with wind and sun,      A treasurer of immortal days,      I roam the glorious world with praise,      The hillsides and the woodland ways,        Till earth and I are one.          FOREST MOODS          There is singing of birds in the deep wet woods,      In the heart of the listening solitudes,      Pewees, and thrushes, and sparrows, not few,      And all the notes of their throats are true.        The thrush from the innermost ash takes on      A tender dream of the treasured and gone;      But the sparrow singeth with pride and cheer      Of the might and light of the present and here.        There is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods,      In the heart of the sensitive solitudes,      The roseate bell and the lily are there,      And every leaf of their sheaf is fair.        Careless and bold, without dream of woe,      The trilliums scatter their flags snow;      But the pale wood-daffodil covers her face,      Agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race.          THE RETURN OF THE YEAR          Again the warm bare earth, the noon        That hangs upon her healing scars,      The midnight round, the great red moon,        The mother with her brood of stars,        The mist-rack and the wakening rain        Blown soft in many a forest way,      The yellowing elm-trees, and again        The blood-root in its sheath of gray.        The vesper-sparrow's song, the stress        Of yearning notes that gush and stream,      The lyric joy, the tenderness,        And once again the dream! the dream!        A touch of far-off joy and power,        A something it is life to learn,      Comes back to earth, and one short hour        The glamours of the gods return.        This life's old mood and cult of care        Falls smitten by an older truth,      And the gray world wins back to her        The rapture of her vanished youth.        Dead thoughts revive, and he that heeds        Shall hear, as by a spirit led,      A song among the golden reeds:        \"The gods are vanished but not dead!\"        For one short hour; unseen yet near,        They haunt us, a forgotten mood,      A glory upon mead and mere,        A magic in the leafless wood.        At morning we shall catch the glow        Of Dian's quiver on the hill,      And somewhere in the glades I know        That Pan is at his piping still.          FAVORITES OF PAN          Once, long ago, before the gods        Had left this earth, by stream and forest glade,      Where the first plough upturned the clinging sods,        Or the lost shepherd strayed,        Often to the tired listener's ear        There came at noonday or beneath the stars      A sound, he knew not whence, so sweet and clear,        That all his aches and scars        And every brooded bitterness,        Fallen asunder from his soul took flight,      Like mist or darkness yielding to the press        Of an unnamed delight,--        A sudden brightness of the heart,        A magic fire drawn down from Paradise,      That rent the cloud with golden gleam apart,--        And far before his eyes        The loveliness and calm of earth        Lay like a limitless dream remote and strange,      The joy, the strife, the triumph and the mirth,        And the enchanted change;        And so he followed the sweet sound,        Till faith had traversed her appointed span,      And murmured as he pressed the sacred ground:        \"It is the note of Pan!\"        Now though no more by marsh or stream        Or dewy forest sounds the secret reed--      For Pan is gone--Ah yet, the infinite dream        Still lives for them that heed.        In April, when the turning year        Regains its pensive youth, and a soft breath      And amorous influence over marsh and mere        Dissolves the grasp of death,        To them that are in love with life,        Wandering like children with untroubled eyes,      Far from the noise of cities and the strife,        Strange flute-like voices rise        At noon and in the quiet of the night        From every watery waste; and in that hour      The same strange spell, the same unnamed delight,        Enfolds them in its power.        An old-world joyousness supreme,        The warmth and glow of an immortal balm,      The mood-touch of the gods, the endless dream,        The high lethean calm.

JOHN WILLIAM BARBER FULLERTON,  Employed in the African Service:    WITH  _A Prefatory Analysis of the Previous Travels_  OF  PARK, DENHAM, CLAPPERTON, ADAMS, LYON, RITCHIE, &c.  Into the hitherto unexplored Countries of Africa.    BY ROBERT  HUISH, ESQ.    Author of the \"Last Voyage of Capt. Sir John Ross, to the Arctic  Regions,\" \"Memoirs of W. Cobbett, Esq.\" \"Private and Political Life  of the late Henry Hunt, Esq.\" &c. &c. &c.    LONDON:    _(Printed for the Proprietors,)_    PUBLISHED BY JOHN SAUNDERS, 25, NEWGATE  STREET.    1836.        INTRODUCTION.    Many are the acquisitions which geography has made since the  boundaries of commerce have been extended, and the spirit of  enterprise has carried our adventurous countrymen into countries  which had never yet been indented by a European foot; and which, in  the great map of the world, appeared as barren and uninhabitable  places, destitute of all resources from which the traveller could  derive a subsistence. It must, however, on the other hand, be  admitted, that design has frequently had little to do in the  discovery of those countries, however well it may have been  conceived, and however great the perseverance may have been, which  was exhibited in the pursuit. The discovery of America was, indeed,  a splendid example of an enlightened conception, and an undaunted  heroism, crowned with the most complete success; and the laudable and  unabated ardour which this country, in despite of the most appalling  obstacles, has persisted in solving the great geographical problem of  the Course and Termination of the Niger, may be placed second in rank  to the discovery of America.    As long as any fact is shut out from the knowledge of man, he who is  in search of it will supply the deficiency by his own conclusions,  which will be more or less removed from the object of his pursuit,  according to the previous opinions which he may have formed, or to  the credit which he may have placed on the reports of others. These  remarks cannot be better illustrated, than in the case furnished by  the Joliba, the Quorra, or Niger, the termination of which river was  utterly unknown until Richard and John Lander, braving difficulties  which would have broken any other hearts than theirs, succeeded in  navigating the river until its conflux with the ocean. Since Park's  first discovery of the Joliba, every point of the compass has been  assumed for the ulterior course and termination of that river, and  however wrong subsequent discovery has proved this speculative  geography to have been, it is not to be regarded as useless. Theories  may be far short of the truth, but while they display the ingenuity  and reasoning powers of their authors, they tend to keep alive that  spirit of inquiry and thirst for knowledge which terminates in  discovery.    Various accounts of this river had been gradually collected from  different sources, which afforded grounds for fresh theories  respecting its termination. That of Reichard was the favourite, he  supposing that it assumed a southwest course, and terminated in the  gulph of Guinea. It was observed at the time, that there was neither  evidence on which such an opinion could be supported, nor any by  which it could be refuted. Discovery has proved him to be right in  respect to its ultimate disposal; but at the same time, he  participated in the general error regarding its course to Wangara.  These different opinions appeared in several publications, in which,  as might be expected, much error was mixed up with the general  correctness. That the river flowed into the sea at Funda, was the  principal and chief point that was gained; but the most extraordinary  circumstance attending this discovery, was, that no one knew where  Funda was. The only exception to these was the theory of Major  Denham, supported by Sultan Bello's information, who continued its  easterly course below Boossa, and ended it in Lake Tchad.    Such was the uncertain condition in which the course of the Niger  remained, when the happy idea occurred of sending the Messrs. Landers  to follow its course below Boossa. By this step the British  government completed what it had begun, and accomplished in a few  months the work of ages.        CONTENTS    CHAP. I.  Herodutus. Early History of Africa.
