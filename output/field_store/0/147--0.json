These three words carry the history of the  United States back to its earliest form in 'the Newe Worlde called  America.' But who prepared the way for the pioneers from the Old World  and what ensured their safety in the New? The title of the present  volume, _Elizabethan Sea-Dogs_, gives the only answer. It was during the  reign of Elizabeth, the last of the Tudor sovereigns of England, that  Englishmen won the command of the sea under the consummate leadership of  Sir Francis Drake, the first of modern admirals. Drake and his  companions are known to fame as Sea-Dogs. They won the English right of  way into Spain's New World. And Anglo-American history begins with that  century of maritime adventure and naval war in which English sailors  blazed and secured the long sea-trail for the men of every other kind  who found or sought their fortunes in America.

The Roman Empire had fallen a thousand years before. Rome now held  temporal sway only over the States of the Church, which were weak in  armed force, even when compared with the small republics, dukedoms, and  principalities which lay north and south. But Papal Rome, as the head  and heart of a spiritual empire, was still a world-power; and the  disunited Italian states were first in the commercial enterprise of the  age as well as in the glories of the Renaissance. North of the Papal  domain, which cut the peninsula in two parts, stood three renowned  Italian cities: Florence, the capital of Tuscany, leading the world in  arts; Genoa, the home of Caboto and Columbus, teaching the world the  science of navigation; and Venice, mistress of the great trade route  between Europe and Asia, controlling the world's commerce.    Thus, in becoming a citizen of Venice, Giovanni Caboto the Genoese was  leaving the best home of scientific navigation for the best home of  sea-borne trade. His very name was no bad credential. Surnames often  come from nicknames; and for a Genoese to be called _Il Caboto_ was as  much as for an Arab of the Desert to be known to his people as The  Horseman. _Cabottaggio_ now means no more than coasting trade. But  before there was any real ocean commerce it referred to the regular  sea-borne trade of the time; and Giovanni Caboto must have either upheld  an exceptional family tradition or struck out an exceptional line for  himself to have been known as John the Skipper among the many other  expert skippers hailing from the port of Genoa.    There was nothing strange in his being naturalized in Venice. Patriotism  of the kind that keeps the citizen under the flag of his own country  was hardly known outside of England, France, and Spain. Though the  Italian states used to fight each other, an individual Italian,  especially when he was a sailor, always felt at liberty to seek his  fortune in any one of them, or wherever he found his chance most  tempting. So the Genoese Giovanni became the Venetian Zuan without any  patriotic wrench. Nor was even the vastly greater change to plain John  Cabot so very startling. Italian experts entered the service of a  foreign monarch as easily as did the 'pay-fighting Swiss' or Hessian  mercenaries. Columbus entered the Spanish service under Ferdinand and  Isabella just as Cabot entered the English service under Henry VII.  Giovanni--Zuan--John: it was all in a good day's work.    Cabot settled in Bristol, where the still existing guild of  Merchant-Venturers was even then two centuries old. Columbus, writing of  his visit to Iceland, says, 'the English, _especially those of Bristol_,  go there with their merchandise.' Iceland was then what Newfoundland  became, the best of distant fishing grounds. It marked one end of the  line of English sea-borne commerce. The Levant marked the other. The  Baltic formed an important branch. Thus English trade already stretched  out over all the main lines. Long before Cabot's arrival a merchant  prince of Bristol, named Canyng, who employed a hundred artificers and  eight hundred seamen, was trading to Iceland, to the Baltic, and, most  of all, to the Mediterranean. The trade with Italian ports stood in high  favor among English merchants and was encouraged by the King; for in  1485, the first year of the Tudor dynasty, an English consul took office  at Pisa and England made a treaty of reciprocity with Tuscany.    Henry VII, first of the energetic Tudors and grandfather of Queen  Elizabeth, was a thrifty and practical man. Some years before the event  about to be recorded in these pages Columbus had sent him a trusted  brother with maps, globes, and quotations from Plato to prove the  existence of lands to the west. Henry had troubles of his own in  England. So he turned a deaf ear and lost a New World. But after  Columbus had found America, and the Pope had divided all heathen  countries between the crowns of Spain and Portugal, Henry decided to see  what he could do.           *       *       *       *       *    Anglo-American history begins on the 5th of March, 1496, when the  Cabots, father and three sons, received the following patent from the  King:    _Henrie, by the grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of  Irelande, to all, to whom these presentes shall come, Greeting--Be it  knowen, that We have given and granted, and by these presentes do give  and grant for Us and Our Heyres, to our well beloved John Gabote,  citizen of Venice, to Lewes, Sebastian, and Santius, sonnes of the sayde  John, and to the heires of them and every of them, and their deputies,  full and free authoritie, leave, and Power, to sayle to all Partes,  Countreys, and Seas, of the East, of the West, and of the North, under  our banners and ensignes, with five shippes, of what burden or quantitie  soever they bee: and as many mariners or men as they will have with them  in the saide shippes, upon their owne proper costes and charges, to  seeke out, discover, and finde, whatsoever Iles, Countreyes, Regions, or  Provinces, of the Heathennes and Infidelles, whatsoever they bee, and in  what part of the worlde soever they bee, whiche before this time have  been unknowen to all Christians. We have granted to them also, and to  every of them, the heires of them, and every of them, and their  deputies, and have given them licence to set up Our banners and ensignes  in every village, towne, castel, yle, or maine lande, of them newly  founde. And that the aforesaide John and his sonnes, or their heires and  assignes, may subdue, occupie, and possesse, all such townes, cities,  castels, and yles, of them founde, which they can subdue, occupie, and  possesse, as our vassailes and lieutenantes, getting unto Us the rule,  title, and jurisdiction of the same villages, townes, castels, and firme  lande so founde._    The patent then goes on to provide for a royalty to His Majesty of  one-fifth of the net profits, to exempt the patentees from custom duty,  to exclude competition, and to exhort good subjects of the Crown to help  the Cabots in every possible way. This first of all English documents  connected with America ends with these words: _Witnesse our Selfe at  Westminster, the Fifth day of March, in the XI yeere of our reigne.  HENRY R._           *       *       *       *       *    _To sayle to all Partes of the East, of the West, and of the North_. The  pointed omission of the word South made it clear that Henry had no  intention of infringing Spanish rights of discovery. Spanish claims,  however, were based on the Pope's division of all the heathen world and  were by no means bounded by any rights of discovery already acquired.    Cabot left Bristol in the spring of 1497, a year after the date of his  patent, not with the 'five shippes' the King had authorized, but in the  little _Matthew_, with a crew of only eighteen men, nearly all  Englishmen accustomed to the North Atlantic. The _Matthew_ made Cape  Breton, the easternmost point of Nova Scotia, on the 24th of June, the  anniversary of St. John the Baptist, now the racial fete-day of the  French Canadians. Not a single human inhabitant was to be seen in this  wild new land, shaggy with forests primeval, fronted with bold, scarped  shores, and beautiful with romantic deep bays leading inland, league  upon league, past rugged forelands and rocky battlements keeping guard  at the frontiers of the continent. Over these mysterious wilds Cabot  raised St. George's Cross for England and the banner of St. Mark in  souvenir of Venice. Had he now reached the fabled islands of the West or  discovered other islands off the eastern coast of Tartary? He did not  know. But he hurried back to Bristol with the news and was welcomed by  the King and people. A Venetian in London wrote home to say that 'this  fellow-citizen of ours, who went from Bristol in quest of new islands,  is Zuan Caboto, whom the English now call a great admiral. He dresses  in silk; they pay him great honour; and everyone "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12873"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: COLUMBIA COLLEGE]       \"It is intended that a large academy be erected, capable of      containing nine thousand seven hundred and forty-three      persons: which, by modest computation, is reckoned to be      pretty near the current number of wits in this island,\"     --_Swift's Tale of a Tub._    London is at length destined to become a seat of learning; or  rather, a seminary as well as a focus and mart of literature:    Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades.    One college is almost completed within her radius, and will be  opened in a few weeks; whilst munificent subscriptions are pouring  in from all quarters of the empire, towards the endowment of a  second. We have hitherto been silent spectators of these grand  strides in the intellectual advancement of our country; but we have  not, on that account, been less sensible of the important benefits  which they are calculated to work in her social scheme, and in        The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.    We are not of those who would (even were Newton's theory  practicable) compress the world into a nutshell, or neglect \"aught  toward the general good;\" and one of our respected correspondents,  who doubtless participates in these cosmopolitan sentiments, has  furnished us with the original of the above view of COLOMBIA  COLLEGE; seeing that this, like the universities of our own country,  is equally important to \"Prince Posterity,\" and accordingly we  proceed with our correspondent's description.    Colombia College, in the city of New York (of the principal building  of which the annexed sketch is a correct representation) may be  ranked among the chief seminaries of learning in America. It was  principally founded by the voluntary contributions of the  inhabitants of the province, assisted by the general assembly and  corporation of Trinity Church, in 1754; at which time it was called  King's College.    A royal charter, and grant of money, was obtained, incorporating a  number of gentlemen therein mentioned, by the name of \"The Governors  of the College of the province of New York, in the City of New  York;\" and granting to them and their successors for ever, among  various other rights and privileges, the power of conferring such  degrees as are usually conferred {34} by the English universities. The  president and members to be of the church of England, and the form  of prayer used to be collected from the Liturgy of the church of  England.    Since the revolution, the legislature passed an act, constituting  twenty-one gentlemen, (of whom were the governor and  lieutenant-governor for the time being,) a body corporate and  politic, by the name of \"the Regents of the University of the state  of New York.\" They were entrusted with the care of the literature of  the state, and a power to grant charters for erecting colleges and  academies throughout the state.    It received the name of Colombia College in 1787; when by an act of  the legislature, it was placed under the care of twenty-four  gentlemen, styled, \"the trustees of the Colombian College,\" who  possessed the same powers as those of King's College.    In 1813, the College of Physicians and the Medical School were  united; and the academical and medical departments are together  styled \"The University of New York.\" It is now well endowed and  liberally patronized by the legislature of the state. The College  consists of two handsome stone edifices, but the view given is but  one-third of the originally intended structure, and contains a  chapel, hall, library of 5,000 volumes, museum, anatomical theatre,  and school for experimental philosophy.    The Medical College is a large, brick building, containing an  anatomical museum, chemical laboratory, mineralogical cabinet,  museum of natural history, and a botanical garden, and nine medical  professors. Every student pays to each professor from 15 to 25  dollars per course.    There are also professors of mathematics, natural philosophy,  history, ancient and modern languages, logic, &c. The number of  students in 1818 was 233, but it has now greatly increased. As many  in each year as finish their course of study, walk in procession  with the other students and all the professors, preceded by a band  of music to St. Paul's church, where they deliver orations in  English and Latin before a crowded assembly. This is called \"a  commencement.\"    The situation is about 150 yards from the Hudson, of which, and the  surrounding country it commands an extensive view. The whole is  enclosed by a stone wall, with an area of several acres,  interspersed with gravel walks, green plats, and full-grown trees.    BETA.        _Note_.--All our readers may not be aware that the remains       of Two Literary Colleges still exist in London: _Gresham      College_ and _Sion College_--or we should say of one of them.      The first was founded and endowed by that excellent citizen      Sir Thomas Gresham. He was much opposed by the university of      Cambridge, which endeavoured to prevent the establishment of      a rival institution. (This was two centuries and a half ago.)      He devised by will, his house in Bishopsgate street, to be      converted into habitations and lecture-rooms for seven      professors or lecturers on seven liberal sciences, who were      to receive a salary out of the revenues of the Royal      Exchange. Gresham College was subsequently converted into the      modern general excise-office; but _the places_ are still      continued, with a double salary for the loss of apartments,      and the lectures are delivered gratuitously twice a day in a      small room in the Royal Exchange, during term-time. The will      of the founder has not, however, been actually carried into      execution. As we hate \"solemn farce\" and \"ignorance in      stilts,\" we hope \"scrutiny will not be stone blind\" in this      matter. A more useful man than Sir Thomas Gresham is not to      be found in British biography, and it is painful to see his      good intentions frustrated.        _Sion College_ is situated near London Wall, to the south of      Fore-street. It was founded in 1623 by the rector of St.      Dunstan's in the west, for the London clergy. The whole body      of rectors and vicars within the city are fellows of this      college, and all the clergy in and near the metropolis may      have free access to its extensive and valuable library.                     *       *       *       *       *    SUPERSTITIONS ON THE WEATHER.    _From Sir H. Davy's Salmonia; or, Days of Fly-fishing.  (In Conversations.)_        POIETES, a Tyro in Fly-fishing.--PHYSICUS, an uninitiated      Angler, fond of inquiries in natural history, &c.--HALIEUS,      an accomplished fly-fisher.--ORNITHER, a sporting gentleman.    _Poietes_. I hope we shall have another good day to-morrow, for  the clouds are red in the west.    _Physicus_. I have no doubt of it, for the red has a tint of  purple.    _Halieus_. Do you know why this tint portends fine weather?    _Phys_. The air, when dry, I believe, refracts more red, or  heat-making rays; and as dry air is not perfectly transparent, they  are again reflected in the horizon. I have generally observed a  coppery or yellow sun-set to foretell rain; but, as an indication of  wet weather approaching, nothing is more certain than a halo round  the moon, which is produced by the precipitated water; and the  larger the circle, the nearer the clouds, and consequently the more  ready to fall.    _Hal_. I have often observed that the old proverb is correct--      A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd's warning:    A rainbow at night is the shepherd's delight.    Can you explain this omen?    _Phys_. A rainbow can only occur when the clouds containing or  depositing the rain are opposite to the sun,--and in the evening the  rainbow is in the east, and in the morning in the west; and as our  {35} heavy rains in this climate are usually brought by the westerly  wind, a rainbow in the west indicates that the bad weather is on the  road, by the wind, to us; whereas the rainbow in the east proves  that the rain in these clouds is passing from us.    _Poiet_. I have often observed, that when the swallows fly  high, fine weather is to be expected or continued; but when they fly  low, and close to the ground, rain is almost surely approaching. Can  you account for this?    _Hal_. Swallows follow the flies and gnats, and flies and gnats  usually delight in warm strata of air; and as warm air is lighter,  and usually moister, than cold air, when the warm strata of air are  high, there is less chance of moisture being thrown down from them  by the mixture with cold air; but when the warm and moist air is  close to the surface, it is almost certain that, as the cold air  flows down into it, a deposition of water will take place.    _Poiet_. I have often seen sea-gulls assemble on the land, and  have almost always observed that very stormy and rainy weather was  approaching. I conclude that these animals, sensible of a current of  air approaching from the ocean, retire to the land to shelter  themselves from the storm.    _Ornither_. No such thing. The storm is their element; and the  little petrel enjoys the heaviest gale, because, living on the  smaller sea-insects, he is sure to find his food in the spray of a  heavy wave--and you may see him flitting above the edge of the  highest surge. I believe that"]]]
