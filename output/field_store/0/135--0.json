It has little to say of  the ultimate psychological basis of speech and gives only enough of the  actual descriptive or historical facts of particular languages to  illustrate principles. Its main purpose is to show what I conceive  language to be, what is its variability in place and time, and what are  its relations to other fundamental human interests--the problem of  thought, the nature of the historical process, race, culture, art.    The perspective thus gained will be useful, I hope, both to linguistic  students and to the outside public that is half inclined to dismiss  linguistic notions as the private pedantries of essentially idle minds.  Knowledge of the wider relations of their science is essential to  professional students of language if they are to be saved from a sterile  and purely technical attitude. Among contemporary writers of influence  on liberal thought Croce is one of the very few who have gained an  understanding of the fundamental significance of language. He has  pointed out its close relation to the problem of art. I am deeply  indebted to him for this insight. Quite aside from their intrinsic  interest, linguistic forms and historical processes have the greatest  possible diagnostic value for the understanding of some of the more  difficult and elusive problems in the psychology of thought and in the  strange, cumulative drift in the life of the human spirit that we call  history or progress or evolution. This value depends chiefly on the  unconscious and unrationalized nature of linguistic structure.    I have avoided most of the technical terms and all of the technical  symbols of the linguistic academy. There is not a single diacritical  mark in the book. Where possible, the discussion is based on English  material. It was necessary, however, for the scheme of the book, which  includes a consideration of the protean forms in which human thought has  found expression, to quote some exotic instances. For these no apology  seems necessary. Owing to limitations of space I have had to leave out  many ideas or principles that I should have liked to touch upon. Other  points have had to be barely hinted at in a sentence or flying phrase.  Nevertheless, I trust that enough has here been brought together to  serve as a stimulus for the more fundamental study of a neglected field.    I desire to express my cordial appreciation of the friendly advice and  helpful suggestions of a number of friends who have read the work in  manuscript, notably Profs. A.L. Kroeber and R.H. Lowie of the University  of California, Prof. W.D. Wallis of Reed College, and Prof. J. Zeitlin  of the University of Illinois.    EDWARD SAPIR.    OTTAWA, ONT.,  April 8, 1921.          CONTENTS    PREFACE    CHAPTER      I. INTRODUCTORY: LANGUAGE DEFINED        Language a cultural, not a biologically inherited, function.      Futility of interjectional and sound-imitative theories of the      origin of speech. Definition of language. The psycho-physical basis      of speech. Concepts and language. Is thought possible without      language? Abbreviations and transfers of the speech process. The      universality of language.      II. THE ELEMENTS OF SPEECH        Sounds not properly elements of speech. Words and significant parts      of words (radical elements, grammatical elements). Types of words.      The word a formal, not a functional unit. The word has a real      psychological existence. The sentence. The cognitive, volitional,      and emotional aspects of speech. Feeling-tones of words.      III. THE SOUNDS OF LANGUAGE        The vast number of possible sounds. The articulating organs and      their share in the production of speech sounds: lungs, glottal      cords, nose, mouth and its parts. Vowel articulations. How and where      consonants are articulated. The phonetic habits of a language. The      \"values\" of sounds. Phonetic patterns.      IV. FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES        Formal processes as distinct from grammatical functions.      Intercrossing of the two points of view. Six main types of      grammatical process. Word sequence as a method. Compounding of      radical elements. Affixing: prefixes and suffixes; infixes. Internal      vocalic change; consonantal change. Reduplication. Functional      variations of stress; of pitch.      V. FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL CONCEPTS        Analysis of a typical English sentence. Types of concepts      illustrated by it. Inconsistent expression of analogous concepts.      How the same sentence may be expressed in other languages with      striking differences in the selection and grouping of concepts.      Essential and non-essential concepts. The mixing of essential      relational concepts with secondary ones of more concrete order. Form      for form's sake. Classification of linguistic concepts: basic or      concrete, derivational, concrete relational, pure relational.      Tendency for these types of concepts to flow into each other.      Categories expressed in various grammatical systems. Order and      stress as relating principles in the sentence. Concord. Parts of      speech: no absolute classification possible; noun and verb.      VI. TYPES OF LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE        The possibility of classifying languages. Difficulties.      Classification into form-languages and formless languages not valid.      Classification according to formal processes used not practicable.      Classification according to degree of synthesis. \"Inflective\" and      \"agglutinative.\" Fusion and symbolism as linguistic techniques.      Agglutination. \"Inflective\" a confused term. Threefold      classification suggested: what types of concepts are expressed? what      is the prevailing technique? what is the degree of synthesis? Four      fundamental conceptual types. Examples tabulated. Historical test of      the validity of the suggested conceptual classification.      VII. LANGUAGE AS A HISTORICAL PRODUCT: DRIFT        Variability of language. Individual and dialectic variations. Time      variation or \"drift.\" How dialects arise. Linguistic stocks.      Direction or \"slope\" of linguistic drift. Tendencies illustrated in      an English sentence. Hesitations of usage as symptomatic of the      direction of drift. Leveling tendencies in English. Weakening of      case elements. Tendency to fixed position in the sentence. Drift      toward the invariable word.      VIII. LANGUAGE AS A HISTORICAL PRODUCT: PHONETIC LAW        Parallels in drift in related languages. Phonetic law as illustrated      in the history of certain English and German vowels and consonants.      Regularity of phonetic law. Shifting of sounds without destruction      of phonetic pattern. Difficulty of explaining the nature of phonetic      drifts. Vowel mutation in English and German. Morphological      influence on phonetic change. Analogical levelings to offset      irregularities produced by phonetic laws. New morphological features      due to phonetic change.      IX. HOW LANGUAGES INFLUENCE EACH OTHER        Linguistic influences due to cultural contact. Borrowing of words.      Resistances to borrowing. Phonetic modification of borrowed words.      Phonetic interinfluencings of neighboring languages. Morphological      borrowings. Morphological resemblances as vestiges of genetic      relationship.      X. LANGUAGE, RACE, AND CULTURE        Naive tendency to consider linguistic, racial, and cultural      groupings as congruent. Race and language need not correspond.      Cultural and linguistic boundaries not identical. Coincidences      between linguistic cleavages and those of language and culture due      to historical, not intrinsic psychological, causes. Language does      not in any deep sense \"reflect\" culture.      XL LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE        Language as the material or medium of literature. Literature may      move on the generalized linguistic plane or may be inseparable from      specific linguistic conditions. Language as a collective art.      Necessary esthetic advantages or limitations in any language. Style      as conditioned by inherent features of the language. Prosody as      conditioned by the phonetic dynamics of a language.    INDEX          I    INTRODUCTORY: LANGUAGE DEFINED      Speech is so familiar a feature of daily life that we rarely pause to  define it. It seems as natural to man as walking, and only less so than  breathing. Yet it needs but a moment's reflection to convince us that  this naturalness of speech is but an illusory feeling. The process of  acquiring speech is, in sober fact, an utterly different sort of thing  from the process of learning to walk. In the case of the latter  function, culture, in other words, the traditional body of social usage,  is not seriously brought into play. The child is individually equipped,  by the complex set of factors that we term biological heredity, to make  all the needed muscular and nervous adjustments that result in walking.  Indeed, the very conformation of these muscles and of the appropriate  parts of the nervous system may be said to be primarily adapted to the  movements made in walking and in similar activities. In a very real  sense the normal human being is predestined to walk, not because his  elders will assist him to learn the art, but because his organism is  prepared from birth, or even from the moment of conception, to take on  all those expenditures of nervous energy and all those muscular  adaptations that result in walking. To put it concisely, walking is an  inherent, biological function of man.    Not so language. It is of course true that in a certain sense the  individual is predestined to talk, but that is due"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12630"],[0,"The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad (#1)"],[1,"ADVENTURES OF OLD MR.

TOAD IN HIS MOST POLITE MANNER          THE ADVENTURES OF OLD MR. TOAD          I      JIMMY SKUNK IS PUZZLED    Old Mother West Wind had just come down from the Purple Hills and turned  loose her children, the Merry Little Breezes, from the big bag in which she  had been carrying them. They were very lively and very merry as they danced  and raced across the Green Meadows in all directions, for it was good to be  back there once more. Old Mother West Wind almost sighed as she watched  them for a few minutes. She felt that she would like to join them. Always  the springtime made her feel this way,--young, mad, carefree, and happy.  But she had work to do. She had to turn the windmill to pump water for  Farmer Brown's cows, and this was only one of many mills standing idle as  they waited for her. So she puffed her cheeks out and started about her  business.    Jimmy Skunk sat at the top of the hill that overlooks the Green Meadows and  watched her out of sight. Then he started to amble down the Lone Little  Path to look for some beetles. He was ambling along in his lazy way, for  you know he never hurries, when he heard some one puffing and blowing  behind him. Of course he turned to see who it was, and he was greatly  surprised when he discovered Old Mr. Toad. Yes, Sir, it was Old Mr. Toad,  and he seemed in a great hurry. He was quite short of breath, but he was  hopping along in the most determined way as if he were in a great hurry to  get somewhere.    Now it is a very unusual thing for Mr. Toad to hurry, very unusual indeed.  As a rule he hops a few steps and then sits down to think it over. Jimmy  had never before seen him hop more than a few steps unless he was trying to  get away from danger, from Mr. Blacksnake for instance. Of course the first  thing Jimmy thought of was Mr. Blacksnake, and he looked for him. But there  was no sign of Mr. Blacksnake nor of any other danger. Then he looked very  hard at Old Mr. Toad, and he saw right away that Old Mr. Toad didn't seem  to be frightened at all, only very determined, and as if he had something  important on his mind.    \"Well, well,\" exclaimed Jimmy Skunk, \"whatever has got into those long hind  legs of yours to make them work so fast?\"    Old Mr. Toad didn't say a word, but simply tried to get past Jimmy and keep  on his way. Jimmy put out one hand and turned Old Mr. Toad right over on  his back, where he kicked and struggled in an effort to get on his feet  again, and looked very ridiculous.    \"Don't you know that it isn't polite not to speak when you are spoken to?\"  demanded Jimmy severely, though his eyes twinkled.    \"I--I beg your pardon. I didn't have any breath to spare,\" panted Old Mr.  Toad. \"You see I'm in a great hurry.\"    \"Yes, I see,\" replied Jimmy. \"But don't you know that it isn't good for the  health to hurry so? Now, pray, what are you in such a hurry for? I don't  see anything to run away from.\"    \"I'm not running away,\" retorted Old Mr. Toad indignantly. \"I've business  to attend to at the Smiling Pool, and I'm late as it is.\"    \"Business!\" exclaimed Jimmy as if he could hardly believe his ears. \"What  business have you at the Smiling Pool?\"    \"That is my own affair,\" retorted Old Mr. Toad, \"but if you really want to  know, I'll tell you. I have a very important part in the spring chorus, and  I'm going down there to sing. I have a very beautiful voice.\"    That was too much for Jimmy Skunk. He just lay down and rolled over and  over with laughter. The idea of any one so homely, almost ugly-looking, as  Mr. Toad thinking that he had a beautiful voice! \"Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!\"  roared Jimmy.    When at last he stopped because he couldn't laugh any more, he discovered  that Old Mr. Toad was on his way again. Hop, hop, hipperty-hop, hop, hop,  hipperty-hop went Mr. Toad. Jimmy watched him, and he confessed that he was  puzzled.          II      JIMMY SKUNK CONSULTS HIS FRIENDS    Jimmy Skunk scratched his head thoughtfully as he watched Old Mr. Toad go  down the Lone Little Path, hop, hop, hipperty-hop, towards the Smiling  Pool. He certainly was puzzled, was Jimmy Skunk. If Old Mr. Toad had told  him that he could fly, Jimmy would not have been more surprised, or found  it harder to believe than that Old Mr. Toad had a beautiful voice. The  truth is, Jimmy didn't believe it. He thought that Old Mr. Toad was trying  to fool him.    Presently Peter Rabbit came along. He found Jimmy Skunk sitting in a brown  study. He had quite forgotten to look for fat beetles, and when he  forgets to do that you may make up your mind that Jimmy is doing some hard  thinking.    \"Hello, old Striped-coat, what have you got on your mind this fine  morning?\" cried Peter Rabbit.    \"Him,\" said Jimmy simply, pointing down the Lone Little Path.    Peter looked. \"Do you mean Old Mr. Toad!\" he asked.    Jimmy nodded. \"Do you see anything queer about him?\" he asked in his turn.    [Illustration: \"Do you see anything queer about him?\" he asked.]    Peter stared down the Lone Little Path. \"No,\" he replied, \"except that he  seems in a great hurry.\"    \"That's just it,\" Jimmy returned promptly. \"Did you ever see him hurry  unless he was frightened?\"    Peter confessed that he never had.    \"Well, he isn't frightened now, yet just look at him go,\" retorted Jimmy.  \"Says he has got a beautiful voice, and that he has to take part in the  spring chorus at the Smiling Pool and that he is late.\"    Peter looked very hard at Jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the  truth. Then he began to laugh. \"Old Mr. Toad sing! The very idea!\" he  cried. \"He can sing about as much as I can, and that is not at all.\"    Jimmy grinned. \"I think he's crazy, if you ask me,\" said he. \"And yet he  was just as earnest about it as if it were really so. I think he must have  eaten something that has gone to his head. There's Unc' Billy Possum over  there. Let's ask him what he thinks.\"    So Jimmy and Peter joined Unc' Billy, and Jimmy told the story about Old  Mr. Toad all over again. Unc' Billy chuckled and laughed just as they had  at the idea of Old Mr. Toad's saying he had a beautiful voice. But Unc'  Billy has a shrewd little head on his shoulders. After a few minutes he  stopped laughing.    \"Ah done learn a right smart long time ago that Ah don' know all there is  to know about mah neighbors,\" said he. \"We-uns done think of Brer Toad as  ugly-lookin' fo' so long that we-uns may have overlooked something. Ah don'  reckon Brer Toad can sing, but Ah 'lows that perhaps he thinks he can. What  do you-alls say to we-uns going down to the Smiling Pool and finding out  what he really is up to?\"    \"The very thing!\" cried Peter, kicking up his heels. You know Peter is  always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity.    Jimmy Skunk thought it over for a few minutes, and then he decided that as  he hadn't anything in particular to do, and as he might find some fat  beetles on the way, he would go too. So off they started after Old Mr.  Toad, Peter Rabbit in the lead as usual, Unc' Billy Possum next, grinning  as only he can grin, and in the rear Jimmy Skunk, taking his time and  keeping a sharp eye out for fat beetles.          III      THE HUNT FOR OLD MR. TOAD    Now, though Old Mr. Toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was  quite out of breath, he wasn't getting along very fast compared with the  way Peter Rabbit or Jimmy Skunk or Unc' Billy Possum could cover the  ground. You see he cannot make long jumps like his cousin, Grandfather  Frog, but only little short hops.    So Peter and Jimmy and Unc' Billy took their time about following him. They  stopped to hunt for fat beetles for Jimmy Skunk, and at every little patch  of sweet clover for Peter Rabbit to help himself. Once they wasted a lot of  time while Unc' Billy Possum hunted for a nest of Carol the Meadow Lark, on  the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there. He didn't find the  nest for the very good reason that Carol hadn't built one yet. Peter was  secretly glad. You know he doesn't eat eggs, and he is always sorry for his  feathered friends when their eggs are stolen.    Half way across the Green Meadows they stopped to play with the Merry  Little Breezes, and because it was very pleasant there, they played longer  than they realized. When at last they started on again, Old Mr. Toad was  out of sight. You see all the time he had kept right on going, hop, hop,  hipperty-hop.    \"Never mind,\" said Peter, \"we can catch up with him easy enough, he's such  a slow-poke.\"    But even a slow-poke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any  time"]]]
