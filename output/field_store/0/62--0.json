[Illustration: HANOVER TERRACE, REGENT'S PARK.]    \"The architectural spirit which has arisen in London since the late  peace, and ramified from thence to every city and town of the empire,  will present an era in our domestic history.\" Such is the opinion of an  intelligent writer in a recent number of Brande's \"Quarterly Journal;\"  and he goes on to describe the new erections in the Regent's Park as the  \"dawning of a new and better taste, and in comparison with that which  preceded it, a just subject of national exultation;\" in illustration of  which fact we have selected the subjoined view of _Hanover Terrace_,  being the last group on the left of the York-gate entrance, and that  next beyond Sussex-place, distinguishable by its cupola tops.    Hanover Terrace, unlike Cornwall and other terraces of the Regent's  Park, is somewhat raised from the level of the road, and fronted by a  shrubbery, through which is a carriage-drive. The general effect of the  terrace is pleasing; and the pediments, supported on an arched rustic  basement by fluted Doric columns, are full of richness and chaste  design; the centre representing an emblematical group of the arts and  sciences, the two ends being occupied with antique devices; and the  three surmounted with figures of the Muses. The frieze is also light and  simply elegant. The architect is Mr. Nash, to whose classic taste the  Regent's Park is likewise indebted for other interesting architectural  groups.    Altogether, Hanover Terrace may be considered as one of the most  splendid works of the neighbourhood, and it is alike characteristic of  British opulence, and of the progressive improvement of national taste.  On the general merits of these erections we shall avail ourselves of the  author already quoted, inasmuch as his remarks are uniformly  distinguished by moderation and good taste.    \"Regent's Park, and its circumjacent buildings, promise, in few years,  to afford something like an equipoise to the boasted _Palace-group_ of  Paris. If the plan already acted upon is steadily pursued, it will  present a union of rural and architectural beauty on a scale of greater  magnificence than can be found in any other place. The variety is here  in the detached groups, and not as formerly in the individual dwellings,  by which all unity and grandeur of effect was, of course, annihilated.  These groups, undoubtedly, will not always bear the eye of a severe  critic, but altogether they exhibit, perhaps, as much beauty as can  easily be introduced into a collection of dwelling-houses of moderate  size. Great care has been taken to give something of a classical air to  every composition; and with this object, the deformity of _door-cases_  has been in most cases excluded, and the entrances made from behind. The  Doric and Ionic orders have been chiefly employed; but the Corinthian,  and even the Tuscan, are occasionally introduced. One of these groups is  finished with domes; but this is an attempt at magnificence which, on so  small a scale, is not deserving of imitation.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      Sir,--Under the _Arcana of Science_, in your last Number, I observed an  account of the inroads made by the sea on the Isle of Sheppey, together  with the exhumation there of numerous animal and vegetable remains. As  an additional fact I inform you, that, at about three hundred feet below  the surface of the sand-bank, (of which the island is composed,) there  is a vast prostrate antediluvian forest, masses of which are being  continually developed by the influence of marine agency, and exhibit  highly singular appearances. When the workmen were employed some years  back in sinking a well to supply the garrison with water, the aid of  gunpowder was required to blast the fossil timber, it having attained,  by elementary action and the repose of ages, the hard compactness of  rock or granite stone. Aquatic productions also appear to observation in  their natural shape and proportion, with the advantage of high  preservation, to facilitate the study of the inquiring philosopher. I  have seen entire lobsters, eels, crabs, &c. all transformed into perfect  lapidifications. Many of these interesting bodies have been selected,  and at the present time tend to enrich the elaborate collections of the  Museum of London and the Institute of France. During the winter of 1825,  in examining a piece of petrified wood, which I had picked up on the  shore, we discovered a very minute aperture, barely the size of a  pin-hole, and on breaking the substance by means of a large hammer, to  our surprise and regret we crushed a small reptile that was concealed  inside, and which, in consequence, we were unfortunately prevented from  restoring to its original shape. The body was of a circular shape and  iron coloured; but from the blood which slightly moistened the face of  the instrument, we were satisfied it must have been animated. I showed  the fragments of both to a gentleman in the island, who, like myself,  lamented the accident, as it had, in all likelihood, deprived science of  forming some valuable (perhaps) deductions on this incarcerated, or (if  I may be allowed the expression) compound phenomenon. I have merely  related the above incident in order to show the possibility of there  being other creatures accessible to discovery under similar  circumstances, and in their nature, perhaps homogeneous. I left the  island next day, and therefore had no further opportunities of  confirming such an opinion; but the place itself abounds with substances  which would authorize such conjectures.    D. A. P.[1]        [1] We thank our correspondent for the above communication on      one of the most interesting phenomena of British geology; for,      as we hinted in our last, the pleasantest hours of our sojourn      at Margate, about three years since, were passed in the      watchmaker's museum, nearly opposite the Marine Library, which      collection contains many Sheppey fossils, especially a _prawn_,      said to be the only one in England. We remember the proprietor      to have been a self-educated man: he had been to the museum at      Paris twice or thrice, and spoke in high terms of the courteous      reception he met with from M Cuvier; and we are happy to      corroborate his representations. With respect to the _reptile_,      or, as we should say, _insect_, alluded to in the preceding      letter, we suppose it to have been a vermicular insect, similar      to those inhabiting the _cells_ of _corallines_, of whose tiny      labours, in the formation of coral islands, we quoted a spirited      poetical description in No. 279 of the MIRROR. Corallines much      resemble fossil or petrified wood; and we recollect to have      received from the landlady of an inn at Portsmouth a small      branch of _fossil wood_, which she asserted to be _coral_, and      _that_ upon the authority of scores of her visiters; but the      fibres, &c. of the wood were too evident to admit of a dispute.           *       *       *       *       *      ANTICIPATED FRENCH MILLENNIUM, OR THE PARISIAN \"TRIVIA.\"    (_For The Mirror._)          \"Travellers of that rare tribe, Who've _seen_ the countries      they describe.\"          HANNAH MORE.

In our SUPPLEMENT No. 412 we gave several engravings and a full  description of the colossal German National monument \"Germania,\" lately  unveiled on the Niederwald slope of the Rhine. We now present, as  beautiful suggestions in art, engravings of the two statues, War and  Peace, which adorn the corners of the monumental facade. These figures  are about twenty feet high. The statue of War represents an allegorical  character, partly Mercury, partly mediaeval knight, with trumpet in one  hand, sword in the other. The statue of Peace represents a mild and  modest maiden, holding out an olive branch in one hand and the full horn  of peaceful blessings in the other. Between the two statues is a  magnificent group in relief representing the \"Watch on the Rhine.\" Here  the Emperor William appears in the center, on horseback, surrounded by a  noble group of kings, princes, knights, warriors, commanders, and  statesmen, who, by word or deed or counsel, helped to found the  empire--an Elgin marble, so to speak, of the German nation.    [Illustration: WAR. THE GERMAN NATIONAL MONUMENT. PEACE.]           *       *       *       *       *    A writer in the London _Lancet_ ridicules a habit of being in great  haste and terribly pressed for time which is common among all classes of  commercial men, and argues that in most cases there is not the least  cause for it, and that it is done to convey a notion of the tremendous  volume of business which almost overwhelms the house. The writer further  says that, when developed into a confirmed habit, it is fertile in  provoking nervous maladies.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ART ASPECTS OF MODERN DRESS.      At a recent conversazione of the London Literary and Artistic Society,  Mr. Sellon read a paper upon this subject. Having expressed his belief  that mere considerations of health would never dethrone fashion, the  lecturer said he should endeavor to show on art principles how those who  were open to conviction could have all the variety Fashion promised,  together with far greater elegance than that goddess could bestow, while  health received the fullest attention. Two excellent societies, worthy  of encouragement up to a certain point, had been showing us the folly  and wickedness of fashionable dress--dress which deformed the body,  crippled the feet, confined the waist, exposed the chest, loaded the  limbs, and even enslaved the understanding. But these societies had been  more successful in pulling down than in building up, and blinded with  excess of zeal were hurrying us onward to a goal which might or might  not be the acme of sanitative dress, but was certainly the zero of  artistic excellence. The cause of this was not far to seek. We were  inventing a new science, that of dress, and were without rules to guide  us. So long as ladies had to choose between Paris fashions and those of  Piccadilly Hall, they would, he felt sure, choose the former. Let it be  shown that the substitute was both sanitary and beautiful, capable of an  infinite variety in color and in form--in colors and forms which never  violated art principle, and in which the wearer, and not some Paris  liner, could exercise her taste, and the day would have been gained.  This was the task he had set himself to formulate, and so doing he  should divide his subject in two--Color and Form.    In color it was desirable to distinguish carefully between the meaning  of shade, tint, and hue. It was amazing that a cultured nation like the  English should be so generally ignorant of the laws of color harmony. We  were nicely critical of music, yet in color were constantly committing  the gravest solecisms. He did not think there were seventeen interiors  in London that the educated eye could wander over without pain. Yet what  knowledge was so useful? We were not competent to buy a picture, choose  a dress, or furnish a house without a knowledge of color harmony, to say  nothing of the facility such knowledge gave in all kinds of painting on  porcelain, art needlework, and a hundred occupations.    An important consideration in choosing colors for dress was the effect  they would have in juxtaposition. Primary colors should be worn in dark  shades; dark red and dark yellow, or as it was commonly called, olive  green, went well together; but a dress of full red or yellow would be  painful to behold. The rule for full primaries was, employ them  sparingly, and contrast them only with black or gray. He might notice in  passing that when people dressed in gray or black the entire dress was  usually of the one color unrelieved. Yet here they had a background that  would lend beauty to any color placed upon it.    Another safe rule was never to place together colors differing widely in  hue. The eye experienced a difficulty in accommodating itself to sudden  changes, and a species of color discord was the consequence. But if the  colors, even though primaries, were of some very dark or very light  shade, they become harmonious. All very dark shades of color went well  with black and with each other, and all very light shades went well with  white and each other.    A much-vexed question with ladies was, \"What will suit my complexion?\"  The generally received opinion was that the complexion was pink, either  light or dark, and colors were chosen accordingly, working dire  confusion. But no one living ever had a pink complexion unless a painted  one. The dolls in the Lowther Arcade were pink, and their pink dresses  were in harmony. No natural complexion whatever was improved by pink;  but gray would go with any. The tendency of gray was to give prominence  to the dominant hue in the complexion. When an artist wished to produce  flesh color he mixed white, light red, yellow ocher, and terra vert. The  skin of a fair person was a gray light red, tinged with green; the color  that would brighten and intensify it most was a gray light sea green,  tinged with pink--in other words, its complementary. A color always  subtracted any similar color that might exist in combination near it.  Thus red beside orange altered it to yellow; blue beside pink altered it  to cerise. Hence, if a person was so unfortunate as to have a muddy  complexion, the worst color they could wear would be their own  complexion's complementary--the best would be mud color, for it would  clear their complexion.    Passing on to the consideration of form in costume, the lecturer urged  that the proper function of dress was to drape the human figure without  disguising or burlesquing it. An illustration of Miss Mary Anderson,  attired in a Greek dress as Parthenia, was exhibited, and the lecturer  observed that while the dress once worn by Greek women"]]]
