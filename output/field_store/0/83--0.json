Missing  punctuation has been supplied silently, but all other errors have been left  uncorrected. To let the reader distinguish such problems from any  inadvertent transcription errors that remain, I have inserted notes to flag  items that appear errors by Brown's own standard.

SIXTH EDITION--REVISED AND IMPROVED.    ENLARGED BY THE ADDITION OF A COPIOUS INDEX OF MATTERS.    BY SAMUEL U. BERRIAN, A. M.          PREFACE    The present performance is, so far as the end could be reached, the  fulfillment of a design, formed about twenty-seven years ago, of one day  presenting to the world, if I might, something like a complete grammar of  the English language;--not a mere work of criticism, nor yet a work too  tame, indecisive, and uncritical; for, in books of either of these sorts,  our libraries already abound;--not a mere philosophical investigation of  what is general or universal in grammar, nor yet a minute detail of what  forms only a part of our own philology; for either of these plans falls  very far short of such a purpose;--not a mere grammatical compend,  abstract, or compilation, sorting with other works already before the  public; for, in the production of school grammars, the author had early  performed his part; and, of small treatises on this subject, we have long  had a superabundance rather than a lack.    After about fifteen years devoted chiefly to grammatical studies and  exercises, during most of which time I had been alternately instructing  youth in four different languages, thinking it practicable to effect some  improvement upon the manuals which explain our own, I prepared and  published, for the use of schools, a duodecimo volume of about three  hundred pages; which, upon the presumption that its principles were  conformable to the best usage, and well established thereby, I entitled,  \"The Institutes of English Grammar.\" Of this work, which, it is believed,  has been gradually gaining in reputation and demand ever since its first  publication, there is no occasion to say more here, than that it was the  result of diligent study, and that it is, essentially, the nucleus, or the  groundwork, of the present volume.    With much additional labour, the principles contained in the Institutes of  English Grammar, have here been not only reaffirmed and rewritten, but  occasionally improved in expression, or amplified in their details. New  topics, new definitions, new rules, have also been added; and all parts of  the subject have been illustrated by a multiplicity of new examples and  exercises, which it has required a long time to amass and arrange. To the  main doctrines, also, are here subjoined many new observations and  criticisms, which are the results of no inconsiderable reading and  reflection.    Regarding it as my business and calling, to work out the above-mentioned  purpose as circumstances might permit, I have laid no claim to genius, none  to infallibility; but I have endeavoured to be accurate, and aspired to be  useful; and it is a part of my plan, that the reader of this volume shall  never, through my fault, be left in doubt as to the origin of any thing it  contains. It is but the duty of an author, to give every needful facility  for a fair estimate of his work; and, whatever authority there may be for  anonymous copying in works on grammar, the precedent is always bad.    The success of other labours, answerable to moderate wishes, has enabled me  to pursue this task under favourable circumstances, and with an unselfish,  independent aim. Not with vainglorious pride, but with reverent gratitude  to God, I acknowledge this advantage, giving thanks for the signal mercy  which has upborne me to the long-continued effort. Had the case been  otherwise,--had the labours of the school-room been still demanded for my  support,--the present large volume would never have appeared. I had desired  some leisure for the completing of this design, and to it I scrupled not to  sacrifice the profits of my main employment, as soon as it could be done  without hazard of adding another chapter to \"the Calamities of Authors.\"    The nature and design of this treatise are perhaps sufficiently developed  in connexion with the various topics which are successively treated of in  the Introduction. That method of teaching, which I conceive to be the best,  is also there described. And, in the Grammar itself, there will be found  occasional directions concerning the manner of its use. I have hoped to  facilitate the study of the English language, not by abridging our  grammatical code, or by rejecting the common phraseolgy [sic--KTH] of its  doctrines, but by extending the former, improving the latter, and  establishing both;--but still more, by furnishing new illustrations of the  subject, and arranging its vast number of particulars in such order that  every item may be readily found.    An other important purpose, which, in the preparation of this work, has  been borne constantly in mind, and judged worthy of very particular  attention, was the attempt to settle, so far as the most patient  investigation and the fullest exhibition of proofs could do it, the  multitudinous and vexatious disputes which have hitherto divided the  sentiments of teachers, and made the study of English grammar so  uninviting, unsatisfactory, and unprofitable, to the student whose taste  demands a reasonable degree of certainty.    \"Whenever labour implies the exertion of thought, it does good, at least to  the strong: when the saving of labour is a saving of thought, it enfeebles.  The mind, like the body, is strengthened by hard exercise: but, to give  this exercise all its salutary effect, it should be of a reasonable kind;  it should lead us to the perception of regularity, of order, of principle,  of a law. When, after all the trouble we have taken, we merely find  anomalies and confusion, we are disgusted with what is so uncongenial: and,  as our higher faculties have not been called into action, they are not  unlikely to be outgrown by the lower, and overborne as it were by the  underwood of our minds. Hence, no doubt, one of the reasons why our  language has been so much neglected, and why such scandalous ignorance  prevails concerning its nature and history, is its unattractive,  disheartening irregularity: none but Satan is fond of plunging into  chaos.\"--_Philological Museum_, (Cambridge, Eng., 1832,) Vol. i, p. 666.    If there be any remedy for the neglect and ignorance here spoken of, it  must be found in the more effectual teaching of English grammar. But the  principles of grammar can never have any beneficial influence over any  person's manner of speaking or writing, till by some process they are made  so perfectly familiar, that he can apply them with all the readiness of a  native power; that is, till he can apply them not only to what has been  said or written, but to whatever he is about to utter. They must present  themselves to the mind as by intuition, and with the quickness of thought;  so as to regulate his language before it proceeds from the lips or the pen.  If they come only by tardy recollection, or are called to mind but as  contingent afterthoughts, they are altogether too late; and serve merely to  mortify the speaker or writer, by reminding him of some deficiency or  inaccuracy which there may then be no chance to amend.    But how shall, or can, this readiness be acquired? I answer, By a careful  attention to such _exercises_ as are fitted to bring the learner's  knowledge into practice. The student will therefore find, that I have given  him something to _do_, as well as something to _learn_. But, by the  formules and directions in this work, he is very carefully shown how to  proceed; and, if he be a tolerable reader, it will be his own fault, if he  does not, by such aid, become a tolerable grammarian. The chief of these  exercises are the _parsing_ of what is right, and the _correcting_ of what  is wrong; both, perhaps, equally important; and I have intended to make  them equally easy. To any real proficient in grammar, nothing can be more  free from embarrassment, than the performance of these exercises, in all  ordinary cases. For grammar, rightly learned, institutes in the mind a  certain knowledge, or process of thought, concerning the sorts, properties,  and relations, of all the words which can be presented in any intelligible  sentence; and, with the initiated, a perception of the construction will  always instantly follow or accompany a discovery of the sense: and  instantly, too, should there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#1)"],[1,"BRILLIANT CAREER    MILES FRANKLIN    1901          PREFACE      A few months before I left Australia I got a letter from the bush signed  \"Miles Franklin\", saying that the writer had written a novel, but knew  nothing of editors and publishers, and asking me to read and advise.  Something about the letter, which was written in a strong original hand,  attracted me, so I sent for the MS., and one dull afternoon I started to  read it. I hadn't read three pages when I saw what you will no doubt see  at once--that the story had been written by a girl. And as I went on I  saw that the work was Australian--born of the bush. I don't know about  the girlishly emotional parts of the book--I leave that to girl readers  to judge; but the descriptions of bush life and scenery came  startlingly, painfully real to me, and I know that, as far as they are  concerned, the book is true to Australia--the truest I ever read. I  wrote to Miles Franklin, and she confessed that she was a girl. I saw  her before leaving Sydney. She is just a little bush girl, barely  twenty-one yet, and has scarcely ever been out of the bush in her life.  She has lived her book, and I feel proud of it for the sake of the  country I came from, where people toil and bake and suffer and are kind;  where every second sun-burnt bushman is a sympathetic humorist, with the  sadness of the bush deep in his eyes and a brave grin for the worst of  times, and where every third bushman is a poet, with a big heart that  keeps his pockets empty.

A TALE THAT IS TOLD AND A DAY THAT IS DONE        INTRODUCTION          _'Possum Gully, near Goulburn,      N.S. Wales, Australia, 1st March, 1899_    _MY DEAR FELLOW AUSTRALIANS,_    _Just a few lines to tell you that this story is all about myself--for  no other purpose do I write it._    _I make no apologies for being egotistical. In this particular I attempt  an improvement on other autobiographies. Other autobiographies weary one  with excuses for their egotism. What matters it to you if I am  egotistical? What matters it to you though it should matter that I am  egotistical?_    _This is not a romance--I have too often faced the music of life to the  tune of hardship to waste time in snivelling and gushing over fancies  and dreams; neither is it a novel, but simply a yarn--a _real_ yarn. Oh!  as real, as really real--provided life itself is anything beyond a  heartless little chimera--it is as real in its weariness and bitter  heartache as the tall gum-trees, among which I first saw the light, are  real in their stateliness and substantiality._    _My sphere in life is not congenial to me. Oh, how I hate this living  death which has swallowed all my teens, which is greedily devouring my  youth, which will sap my prime, and in which my old age, if I am cursed  with any, will be worn away! As my life creeps on for ever through the  long toil-laden days with its agonizing monotony, narrowness, and  absolute uncongeniality, how my spirit frets and champs its unbreakable  fetters--all in vain!_      SPECIAL NOTICE    You can dive into this story head first as it were. Do not fear  encountering such trash as descriptions of beautiful sunsets and  whisperings of wind. We (999 out of every 1000) can see nought in  sunsets save as signs and tokens whether we may expect rain on the  morrow or the contrary, so we will leave such vain and foolish imagining  to those poets and painters--poor fools! Let us rejoice that we are not  of their temperament!    Better be born a slave than a poet, better be born a black, better be  born a cripple! For a poet must be companionless--alone! _fearfully_  alone in the midst of his fellows whom he loves. Alone because his soul  is as far above common mortals as common mortals are above monkeys.        There is no plot in this story, because there has been none in my life  or in any other life which has come under my notice. I am one of a  class, the individuals of which have not time for plots in their life,  but have all they can do to get their work done without indulging in  such a luxury.          CHAPTER ONE    I Remember, I Remember      \"Boo, hoo! Ow, ow; Oh! oh! Me'll die. Boo, hoo. The pain, the pain! Boo,  hoo!\"    \"Come, come, now. Daddy's little mate isn't going to turn Turk like  that, is she? I'll put some fat out of the dinner-bag on it, and tie it  up in my hanky. Don't cry any more now. Hush, you must not cry! You'll  make old Dart buck if you kick up a row like that.\"    That is my first recollection of life. I was barely three. I can  remember the majestic gum-trees surrounding us, the sun glinting on  their straight white trunks, and falling on the gurgling fern-banked  stream, which disappeared beneath a steep scrubby hill on our left. It  was an hour past noon on a long clear summer day. We were on a distant  part of the run, where my father had come to deposit salt. He had left  home early in the dewy morning, carrying me in front of him on a little  brown pillow which my mother had made for the purpose. We had put the  lumps of rock-salt in the troughs on the other side of the creek. The  stringybark roof of the salt-shed which protected the troughs from rain  peeped out picturesquely from the musk and peppercorn shrubs by which it  was densely surrounded, and was visible from where we lunched. I  refilled the quart-pot in which we had boiled our tea with water from  the creek, father doused our fire out with it, and then tied the quart  to the D of his saddle with a piece of green hide. The green-hide bags  in which the salt had been carried were hanging on the hooks of the  pack-saddle which encumbered the bay pack-horse. Father's saddle and the  brown pillow were on Dart, the big grey horse on which he generally  carried me, and we were on the point of making tracks for home.      Preparatory to starting, father was muzzling the dogs which had just  finished what lunch we had left. This process, to which the dogs  strongly objected, was rendered necessary by a cogent reason. Father had  brought his strychnine flask with him that day, and in hopes of causing  the death of a few dingoes, had put strong doses of its contents in  several dead beasts which we had come across.    Whilst the dogs were being muzzled, I busied myself in plucking ferns  and flowers. This disturbed a big black snake which was curled at the  butt of a tree fern.    \"Bitey! bitey!\" I yelled, and father came to my rescue, despatching the  reptile with his stock-whip. He had been smoking, and dropped his pipe  on the ferns. I picked it up, and the glowing embers which fell from it  burnt my dirty little fat fists. Hence the noise with which my story  commences.    In all probability it was the burning of my fingers which so indelibly  impressed the incident on my infantile mind. My father was accustomed to  take me with him, but that is the only jaunt at that date which I  remember, and that is all I remember of it. We were twelve miles from  home, but how we reached there I do not know.    My father was a swell in those days--held Bruggabrong, Bin Bin East, and  Bin Bin West, which three stations totalled close on 200,000 acres.  Father was admitted into swelldom merely by right of his position. His  pedigree included nothing beyond a grandfather. My mother, however, was  a full-fledged aristocrat. She was one of the Bossiers of Caddagat, who  numbered among their ancestry one of the depraved old pirates who  pillaged England with William the Conqueror.    \"Dick\" Melvyn was as renowned for hospitality as joviality, and our  comfortable, wide-veranda'ed, irregularly built, slab house in its  sheltered nook amid the Timlinbilly Ranges was ever full to overflowing.  Doctors, lawyers, squatters, commercial travellers, bankers,  journalists, tourists, and men of all kinds and classes crowded our  well-spread board; but seldom a female face, except mother's, was to be  seen there, Bruggabrong being a very out-of-the-way place.    I was both the terror and the amusement of the station. Old  boundary-riders and drovers inquire after me"]]]
