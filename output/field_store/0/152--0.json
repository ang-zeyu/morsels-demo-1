TO THE READER      Certain of the newspapers, when this book was first announced, made a  mistake most natural upon seeing the sub-title as it then stood, A TALE  OF SUNDRY ADVENTURES. \"This sounds like a historical novel,\" said one  of them, meaning (I take it) a colonial romance. As it now stands, the  title will scarce lead to such interpretation; yet none the less is this  book historical--quite as much so as any colonial romance. Indeed,  when you look at the root of the matter, it is a colonial romance. For  Wyoming between 1874 and 1890 was a colony as wild as was Virginia one  hundred years earlier. As wild, with a scantier population, and the  same primitive joys and dangers. There were, to be sure, not so many  Chippendale settees.    We know quite well the common understanding of the term \"historical  novel.\" HUGH WYNNE exactly fits it. But SILAS LAPHAM is a novel as  perfectly historical as is Hugh Wynne, for it pictures an era and  personifies a type. It matters not that in the one we find George  Washington and in the other none save imaginary figures; else THE  SCARLET LETTER were not historical. Nor does it matter that Dr. Mitchell  did not live in the time of which he wrote, while Mr. Howells saw  many Silas Laphams with his own eyes; else UNCLE TOM'S CABIN were  not historical. Any narrative which presents faithfully a day and a  generation is of necessity historical; and this one presents Wyoming  between 1874 and 1890. Had you left New York or San Francisco at ten  o'clock this morning, by noon the day after to-morrow you could step out  at Cheyenne. There you would stand at the heart of the world that is  the subject of my picture, yet you would look around you in vain for the  reality. It is a vanished world. No journeys, save those which memory  can take, will bring you to it now. The mountains are there, far and  shining, and the sunlight, and the infinite earth, and the air that  seems forever the true fountain of youth, but where is the buffalo, and  the wild antelope, and where the horseman with his pasturing thousands?  So like its old self does the sage-brush seem when revisited, that you  wait for the horseman to appear.    But he will never come again. He rides in his historic yesterday. You  will no more see him gallop out of the unchanging silence than you will  see Columbus on the unchanging sea come sailing from Palos with his  caravels.    And yet the horseman is still so near our day that in some chapters of  this book, which were published separate at the close of the nineteenth  century, the present tense was used. It is true no longer. In those  chapters it has been changed, and verbs like \"is\" and \"have\" now read  \"was\" and \"had.\" Time has flowed faster than my ink.    What is become of the horseman, the cow-puncher, the last romantic figure  upon our soil? For he was romantic. Whatever he did, he did with his  might. The bread that he earned was earned hard, the wages that he  squandered were squandered hard,--half a year's pay sometimes gone in a  night,--\"blown in,\" as he expressed it, or \"blowed in,\" to be perfectly  accurate. Well, he will be here among us always, invisible, waiting his  chance to live and play as he would like. His wild kind has been among  us always, since the beginning: a young man with his temptations, a hero  without wings.    The cow-puncher's ungoverned hours did not unman him. If he gave his  word, he kept it; Wall Street would have found him behind the times.  Nor did he talk lewdly to women; Newport would have thought him  old-fashioned. He and his brief epoch make a complete picture, for in  themselves they were as complete as the pioneers of the land or the  explorers of the sea. A transition has followed the horseman of the  plains; a shapeless state, a condition of men and manners as unlovely as  is that moment in the year when winter is gone and spring not come, and  the face of Nature is ugly. I shall not dwell upon it here. Those who  have seen it know well what I mean. Such transition was inevitable. Let  us give thanks that it is but a transition, and not a finality.    Sometimes readers inquire, Did I know the Virginian? As well, I hope,  as a father should know his son. And sometimes it is asked, Was such and  such a thing true? Now to this I have the best answer in the world.  Once a cow-puncher listened patiently while I read him a manuscript.  It concerned an event upon an Indian reservation. \"Was that the Crow  reservation?\" he inquired at the finish. I told him that it was no  real reservation and no real event; and his face expressed displeasure.  \"Why,\" he demanded, \"do you waste your time writing what never happened,  when you know so many things that did happen?\"    And I could no more help telling him that this was the highest  compliment ever paid me than I have been able to help telling you about  it here!    CHARLESTON, S.C., March 31st, 1902          THE VIRGINIAN          I. ENTER THE MAN      Some notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to  the window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was.  I saw near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and  inside it some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging,  huddling, and dodging. They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them  would not be caught, no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty of time  to watch this sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might  take water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station  platform of Medicine Bow. We were also six hours late, and starving for  entertainment. The pony in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have  you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet, incessant  eye? Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took the  rope. The man might pretend to look at the weather, which was fine; or  he might affect earnest conversation with a bystander: it was bootless.  The pony saw through it. No feint hoodwinked him. This animal was  thoroughly a man of the world. His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon  the dissembling foe, and the gravity of his horse-expression made the  matter one of high comedy. Then the rope would sail out at him, but he  was already elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gayety must have abounded in  that corral. Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had slid in a  flash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a school of playful  fish whipped round the corral, kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it)  roaring with laughter. Through the window-glass of our Pullman the thud  of their mischievous hoofs reached us, and the strong, humorous curses  of the cow-boys. Then for the first time I noticed a man who sat on the  high gate of the corral, looking on. For he now climbed down with  the undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his muscles flowed  beneath his skin. The others had all visibly whirled the rope, some of  them even shoulder high. I did not see his arm lift or move. He appeared  to hold the rope down low, by his leg. But like a sudden snake I saw the  noose go out its length and fall true; and the thing was done. As the  captured pony walked in with a sweet, church-door expression, our train  moved slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked, \"That man  knows his business.\"    But the passenger's dissertation upon roping I was obliged to lose, for  Medicine Bow was my station. I bade my fellow-travellers good-by, and  descended, a stranger, into the great cattle land. And here in less than  ten minutes I learned news which made me feel a stranger indeed.    My baggage was lost; it had not come on my train; it was adrift  somewhere back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me. And by way  of comfort, the baggage-man remarked that passengers often got astray  from their trunks, but the trunks mostly found them after a while.  Having offered me this encouragement, he turned whistling to his  affairs and left me planted in the baggage-room at Medicine Bow. I stood  deserted among crates and boxes, blankly holding my check, hungry and  forlorn. I stared out through the door at the sky and the plains; but  I did not see the antelope shining among the sage-brush, nor the great  sunset light of Wyoming. Annoyance blinded my eyes to all things save  my grievance: I saw only a lost trunk. And I was muttering half-aloud,  \"What a forsaken hole this is!\" when suddenly from outside on the  platform came a slow voice: \"Off to get married AGAIN? Oh, don't!\"    The voice was Southern and gentle and drawling; and a second voice came  in immediate answer, cracked and querulous. \"It ain't again. Who says  it's again? Who told you, anyway?\"    And the first voice responded caressingly: \"Why, your Sunday clothes  told me, Uncle Hughey. They are speakin' mighty loud o' nuptials.\"    \"You don't worry me!\" snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.    And the other gently continued, \"Ain't them gloves the same yu' wore to  your last weddin'?\"    \"You don't worry me! You don't worry me!\" now screamed Uncle Hughey.    Already I had forgotten my trunk; care had left me; I was aware of the  sunset, and had no desire but for more of this conversation. For it  resembled none that I had heard in my life so far. I stepped to the door  and looked out upon the station platform.    Lounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant,  more beautiful than pictures. His broad, soft hat was pushed back; a  loose-knotted, dull-scarlet handkerchief sagged from his throat; and one  casual thumb was hooked in the cartridge-belt that slanted across his  hips.

George Sand is about to publish a book called \"Memoirs of my Life,\"  which is looked for with great expectations by both the admirers of  her genius and the lovers of scandalous gossip. It is certain that if  she makes a clean breast of her adventures and experiences, the world  will have reason both for admiration and disgust over the confessions:  admiration for the generosity of her character--for she never did  a mean thing, and probably never had a mean thought--disgust at the  recklessness with which she has cast off the delicacy and modesty of  woman, and undermined the morality on which the holiest institutions  of society depend. The interest with which the French public look  forward to the book may be understood from the enormous price she  has received for it between $30,000 and $40,000. The _Credit_, a most  respectable daily journal of Paris, has purchased of the publisher,  for $12,000, the right of issuing the first six volumes in its  _feuilleton_, in advance of the regular publication, and will soon  commence them.    Chateaubriand, in one of the latest chapters of his Posthumous  Memoirs, speaks at some length of George Sand. The verdict of the most  illustrious French literary man of the age which has just closed,  upon this most remarkable writer of the age now passing, is every  way interesting, and we translate it for the _International_ from the  columns of _La Presse_, as follows:    Madame Sand possesses talents of the first order. Her descriptions are  true as those of Rousseau in his Reveries, and those of Bernardin  St. Pierre in his Studies. Her free style is stained by none of the  current faults of the day. Lelia, a book painful to read, and offering  only here and there one of the delicious scenes which may be found in  Indiana and Valentine, is nevertheless a master-work of its kind. Of  the nature of a debauch, it is yet without passion, though it produces  the disturbance of passion. The soul is wanting, but still it weighs  upon the heart. Depravity of maxims, insult to rectitude of life,  could not go farther; but over the abyss descends the talent of the  author. In the valley of Gomorrah the dew falls nightly upon the Dead  Sea.    The works of Madame Sand, those romances, the poetry of matter, are  born of the epoch. Notwithstanding her superiority, it is to be feared  that the author has narrowed the circle of her readers by the very  character of her writings. George Sand will never be a favorite with  persons of all ages. Of two men equal in genius, one of whom preaches  order and the other disorder, the first will attract the greater  number of hearers. The human race never give unanimous applause to  what wounds morality, on which repose the feeble and the just. We do  not willingly associate with all the recollections of our life those  books which caused us the first blush, and whose pages were not  those we learned by heart as we left the cradle: books which we have  read only in secret, which have never been our avowed and cherished  companions, and which were never mingled with either the candor of our  sentiments or the integrity of our innocence. Providence has confined  to very straight limits all success which has not its source in  goodness, and has given universal glory as an encouragement for  virtue.    I am aware that I reason here like a man whose narrow view does not  embrace the vast _humanitary_ horizon, like a retrograde attached to  a ridiculous system of morality, a morality already passing to decay,  and at the best good only for minds without intelligence, in the  infancy of society. There is close at hand the birth of a new gospel,  far above the common-places of this conventional wisdom, which hinders  the progress of the human race, and the restoration to dignity and  honor of this poor body, so calumniated by the soul. When women all  resort to the street--when to perform the marriage ceremony it will  be enough to open the window and call on God as witness, priest,  and wedding-guest--then all prudery will be destroyed; there will be  espousals everywhere, and we shall rise the same as the birds to the  grandeur of nature. My criticism on books of the sort of George Sand's  has then no value except in the vulgar order of things past, and  therefore I trust she will not be offended by it. The admiration I  profess for her ought to make her excuse these remarks, which have  their origin in the infelicity of my age. Once I should have been more  carried away by the Muses. Those daughters of heaven were in times  past my lovely mistresses, now they are only my ancient friends. At  evening they kept me company by the fireside, but they soon depart;  for I go to bed early, and then they hasten to take their places  around the hearth-stone of Madame Sand.    Without doubt Madame Sand will in this path prove her intellectual  omnipotence, but yet she will please less, because she will be less  original. She will fancy she augments her power by venturing into the  depths of these reveries, beneath which we deplorable common mortals  are buried, and she will be mistaken. In fact she is much superior  to this extravagance, this vagueness, this presumptuous balderdash.  At the same time that a person endowed with a rare but too flexible  faculty, should be guarded against follies of the higher order, he  ought also to be warned that fantastic compositions, subjective or  intimate, painting (so runs the jargon) are restricted; that their  course is in youth; that its springs are drying up every instant, and  that after a number of productions the writer finishes with nothing  but weak repetitions.    Is it very likely that Madame Sand will always find the same charm  in what she now composes? Will not the merit and the enthusiasm of  twenty lose their value in her mind as the works of my first days are  depreciated in mine? There is nothing changeless except the labors of  the antique muse, and they are sustained by a nobility of manners, a  beauty of language, and a majesty of sentiments, which belong to the  entire human species. The fourth book of the Eneid remains forever  exposed to the admiration of men because it is suspended in heaven.  The ships bearing the founder of the Roman Empire,--Dido, the  foundress of Carthage, stabbing herself after having announced  Hannibal:      Exoriare aliquis nostius exossibus ulta.--    Love causing the rivality of Rome and Carthage to leap from the flame  of his torch, lighting with his own hand the funeral pile, whose  blaze the fugitive Eneas perceives upon the waves,--is altogether  another thing than the promenade of a dreamer in the woods, or the  disappearance of a libertine who drowns himself in the sea. Madame  Sand will, I trust, yet associate her talents with subjects as durable  as her genius.    Madame Sand can only be converted by the preaching of that missionary  with bald forehead and hoary beard, called Time. A voice less  austere meanwhile enchains the captive ear of the poet. In fact, I  am persuaded that the talent of Madame Sand has some of its roots in  corruption; in becoming modest she would become commonplace. It would  have been otherwise had she always remained in that sanctuary not  frequented by men; her power of love, restrained and concealed beneath  the virginal fillet, would have drawn from her heart those decent  melodies which belong at once to the woman and the angel. However that  may be, audacity of ideas and voluptuousness of manners form a spot  not before cleared up by a daughter of Adam, and which, submitted to  a woman's culture, has yielded a harvest of unknown flowers. Let us  permit Madame Sand to produce these perilous marvels till the approach  of winter; she will sing no more _when the North wind has come_.  Meanwhile, less improvident than the grasshopper, let her make  provision of glory for the time when there will be a famine of  pleasure. The mother of Musarion was wont to repeat to her child:  \"Thou wilt not always be sixteen; will Choereas always remember his  oath, his tears and his caresses?\"    For the rest, women have often been seduced, and as it were carried  off, by their own youth, but toward the days of autumn, restored  to the maternal hearth, they have added to their harps the grave  or plaintive chord on which either religion or unhappiness finds  expression. Old age is a traveler in the night time; the earth is  hidden from sight and he can see nothing but the heavens shining above  his head.    I have not seen Madame Sand dressed in men's clothes or wearing the  blouse and the iron-shod staff of the mountaineer. I have not seen her  drinking from the cup of bacchanals and smoking indolently reclining  on a sofa like a sultana,--natural or affected eccentricities which  for me could add nothing to her charms or her genius.    Is she more inspired when she causes a cloud of vapor to rise from  her mouth about her hair? Did Lelia escape from the head of her mother  through a burning mist, as Sin, according to Milton, proceeded from  the head of the glorious and guilty archangel amid a whirlpool of  smoke? I know not what passes in the sacred courts; but here below  Neamede, Phila, Lais, Gnathene, the witty Phryne, the despair of the  pencil of Apelles, and the chisel of Praxiteles, Leena, beloved of  Harmodias, the two sisters named Aphyes, because they were small and  had large eyes, Dorica, the fillet of whose locks and embalmed robe  were consecrated in the temple of Venus,--all these enchantresses knew  only the perfumes of Arabia. It is true that Madame Sand has on her  side the authority of the Odalisques and the young Mexicans"]]]
