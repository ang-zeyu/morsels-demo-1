LORD GROSVENOR'S GALLERY, PARK LANE.      [Illustration: THE GROSVENOR GALLERY, PARK LANE.]    At the commencement of our Twelfth Volume, we took occasion to allude to  the public spirit of the Earl of Grosvenor, in our description of his  splendid mansion--Eaton Hall, near Chester. We likewise adverted to his  lordship's munificent patronage of the Fine Arts, and to the erection of  the Gallery which forms the subject of the annexed Engraving.    The Gallery forms the western wing of Lord Grosvenor's spacious town  mansion in Park Lane. It is from the designs of Mr. Cundy, and consists  of a colonnade of the Corinthian order, raised upon a plain joined  stylobate. Over each column of the principal building is an isolated  statue with an attic behind them, after the manner of the ancient  building called by Palladio the Forum Trajan at Rome. On the acroteria  of the building are vases on a balustrade, and between the columns is a  series of blank windows with balustraded balconies and triangular  pediments, which Mr. Elmes thinks are so introduced as to disfigure the  other grand parts of the design. Above these are sunk panels, with swags  or garlands of fruit and flowers. Mr. E. is likewise of opinion that,  \"but for the stopped-up windows, and the overpowering and needless  balustrade over the heads of the statues, this building would rank among  the very first in the metropolis; even with these trifling drawbacks,  that can easily be remedied before the whole is completed, it is grand,  architectural, and altogether worthy of its noble proprietor.\"    The reader need not be told that the above Gallery has been erected for  the reception of the superb Grosvenor collection, the first effectual  foundation of which was laid by the purchase of the late Mr. Agar's  pictures for 30,000 guineas, and it has since been gradually enlarged  until it has become one of the finest collection in England. It is not  confined to works of the old masters, but embraces the best productions  of some of the most celebrated modern painters. The Earl of Grosvenor  has, for some years, been in the habit of admitting the public in the  months of May and June, to inspect his pictures, under certain  restrictions.    The Picture Gallery is but a portion of the improvements contemplated by  Lord Grosvenor. The mansion, in the distance of the Engraving is, we  believe, to be rebuilt in a correspondent style with the Gallery, and  the whole when completed, will be one of the most splendid  establishments in the metropolis.    Indeed, the recent embellishment of several mansions in Park Lane is  already indicative of the improved taste of their distinguished  occupants. A few years since the Lane for the most part consisted of  unsightly brick fronts; but stone and plaster encasements have given it  the appearance of a new neighbourhood.           *       *       *       *       *      HENRY JENKINS.    _(For the Mirror.)_      A table showing the various changes in his religion, which by the  statute were required of Henry Jenkins, of Ellerton-upon-Swale, in the  county of York, in compliance with the principle, that the English  Constitution is essentially identified with the religion of the state,  and making it his bounden duty (as that of every subject) to conform to  it. Henry Jenkins was born in 1501, and died at the age of 169, in 1670.  He consequently was required by law, to adopt the following changes in  his religious creed and practice:--                                                             Henry Jenkins                                 The Constitution          should have been            Reigns of            being essentially         during    1st from  Henry VII. and VIII.

Jenkins was buried at Bolton-upon-Swale. A handsome pyramid marks his  grave, as the oldest Englishman upon record, and in the church is a  monument to his memory, with the following inscription, written by Dr.  Thomas Chapman:--      Blush not marble!    To rescue from oblivion    The memory of    Henry Jenkins,    A person obscure in birth,    But of a life truly memorable,    For    He was enriched    With the goods of nature    If not of fortune;    And happy    In the duration    If not variety    Of his enjoyments,    And tho' the partial world    Despised and disregarded    His low and humble state,    The equal eye of Providence    Beheld and blessed it    With a Patriarch's health and length of days    To teach mistaken man    These blessings    Were entailed on temperance,    A life of labour, and a mind at ease.    He lived to the amazing age of    169 years,    Was interred here the 6th December,    1670,    And had this justice done to his memory,    1743.    ARTHUR EBOR.           *       *       *       *       *      VENERATION OF CATS IN ANCIENT DAYS, AND VALUE OF KITTENS, &c.    _(For the Mirror.)_      The cat was held in high veneration by the ancient Egyptians. When a cat  died in a house, the owner of the house shaved his eye-brows; they  carried the cats when dead into consecrated houses to be embalmed, and  interred them at Bubastis, a considerable city of Lower Egypt. If any  killed a cat, though by accident, he could not escape death. Even in the  present day they are treated with the utmost care in that country, on  account of their destroying the rats and mice. They are trained in some  of the Grecian islands to attack and destroy serpents, with which those  islands abound.    In the time of Howel Dha, _Howel the Good_, Prince of Wales, who died in  the year 948, laws were made both to preserve and fix the prices of  different animals; among which the cat was included, as being at that  early period of great importance, on account of its scarcity and  utility. The price of a kitten before it could see, was fixed at one  penny; till proof could be given of its having caught a mouse,  two-pence; after which it was rated at four-pence, a great sum in those  days, when the value of specie was extremely high. It was likewise  required, that the animal should be perfect in its senses of hearing and  seeing, should be a good mouser, have its claws whole, and if a female,  be a careful nurse. If it failed in any of these qualifications, the  seller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value. If any  one should steal or kill the cat that guarded the prince's granary, the  offender was to forfeit either a milch ewe, her fleece, and lamb, or as  much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by its tail, (its head  touching the floor) would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of  the tail. From these circumstances (says Pennant) we may conclude that  cats were not originally natives of these islands, and from the great  care taken to improve and preserve the breed of this prolific creature,  we may with propriety suppose that they were but little known at that  period.    When Mr. Baumgarten was at Damascus, he saw there a kind of hospital for  cats; the house in which they were kept was very large, walled round,  and was said to be quite full of them. On inquiring into the origin of  this singular institution, he was told that Mahomet, when he once lived  there, brought with him a cat, which he kept in the sleeve of his gown,  and carefully fed with his own hands. His followers in this place,  therefore, ever afterwards paid a superstitious respect to these  animals; and supported them in this manner by public alms, which were  very adequate to the purpose. Browne, in his _History of Jamaica_, tells  us, \"A cat is a very dainty dish among the negroes.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      ST. DUNSTAN'S, FLEET STREET.    _(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_      In your account of this church, in No. 388, I perceive you state that  the clock and figures were put up in 1761, whereas I find by reference  to works on this subject, that they were so placed in 1671.[1]        [1] Occasioned by a transposition of figures. In vol. xi.      referred to in the above page, the date stands 1671.    There are many curious monuments in this church, and among others, is  the beautiful one to the memory of Sir Richard Hoare, Knt. who was Lord  Mayor of London in the memorable year 1745, at which \"alarming crisis,\"  in the words of the inscription, \"he discharged the great trust reposed  in him with honour and integrity, to the approbation of his sovereign  and the universal satisfaction of his fellow citizens.\" He died in 1754,  and was buried in this church. The monument, which is of marble,  consists of a sarcophagus, above which is a cherub in the act of  crowning a beautiful bust of Sir Richard with a laurel wreath, above is  a shield of arms, within an orb ar. sa. a spread eagle of the first  bearing an escutcheon of pretence ar. a lion ppr. in chief in base a  chev. gu. charged with three escallop shells of the first, impaling a  saltire sa. between four crosses fitche of the same.

THE LENTON CROFT ROBBERIES.    Those who retain any memory of the great law cases of fifteen or twenty  years back will remember, at least, the title of that extraordinary will  case, \"Bartley _v_. Bartley and others,\" which occupied the Probate Court  for some weeks on end, and caused an amount of public interest rarely  accorded to any but the cases considered in the other division of the same  court. The case itself was noted for the large quantity of remarkable and  unusual evidence presented by the plaintiff's side--evidence that took the  other party completely by surprise, and overthrew their case like a house  of cards. The affair will, perhaps, be more readily recalled as the  occasion of the sudden rise to eminence in their profession of Messrs.  Crellan, Hunt & Crellan, solicitors for the plaintiff--a result due  entirely to the wonderful ability shown in this case of building up,  apparently out of nothing, a smashing weight of irresistible evidence.  That the firm has since maintained--indeed enhanced--the position it then  won for itself need scarcely be said here; its name is familiar to  everybody. But there are not many of the outside public who know that the  credit of the whole performance was primarily due to a young clerk in the  employ of Messrs. Crellan, who had been given charge of the seemingly  desperate task of collecting evidence in the case.    This Mr. Martin Hewitt had, however, full credit and reward for his  exploit from his firm and from their client, and more than one other firm  of lawyers engaged in contentious work made good offers to entice Hewitt  to change his employers. Instead of this, however, he determined to work  independently for the future, having conceived the idea of making a  regular business of doing, on behalf of such clients as might retain him,  similar work to that he had just done with such conspicuous success for  Messrs. Crellan, Hunt & Crellan. This was the beginning of the private  detective business of Martin Hewitt, and his action at that time has been  completely justified by the brilliant professional successes he has since  achieved.    His business has always been conducted in the most private manner, and he  has always declined the help of professional assistants, preferring to  carry out himself such of the many investigations offered him as he could  manage. He has always maintained that he has never lost by this policy,  since the chance of his refusing a case begets competition for his  services, and his fees rise by a natural process. At the same time, no man  could know better how to employ casual assistance at the right time.    Some curiosity has been expressed as to Mr. Martin Hewitt's system, and,  as he himself always consistently maintains that he has no system beyond a  judicious use of ordinary faculties, I intend setting forth in detail a  few of the more interesting of his cases in order that the public may  judge for itself if I am right in estimating Mr. Hewitt's \"ordinary  faculties\" as faculties very extraordinary indeed. He is not a man who has  made many friendships (this, probably, for professional reasons),  notwithstanding his genial and companionable manners. I myself first made  his acquaintance as a result of an accident resulting in a fire at the old  house in which Hewitt's office was situated, and in an upper floor of  which I occupied bachelor chambers. I was able to help in saving a  quantity of extremely important papers relating to his business, and,  while repairs were being made, allowed him to lock them in an old  wall-safe in one of my rooms which the fire had scarcely damaged.    The acquaintance thus begun has lasted many years, and has become a rather  close friendship. I have even accompanied Hewitt on some of his  expeditions, and, in a humble way, helped him. Such of the cases, however,  as I personally saw nothing of I have put into narrative form from the  particulars given me.    \"I consider you, Brett,\" he said, addressing me, \"the most remarkable  journalist alive. Not because you're particularly clever, you know,  because, between ourselves, I hope you'll admit you're not; but because  you have known something of me and my doings for some years, and have  never yet been guilty of giving away any of my little business secrets you  may have become acquainted with. I'm afraid you're not so enterprising a  journalist as some, Brett. But now, since you ask, you shall write  something--if you think it worth while.\"    This he said, as he said most things, with a cheery, chaffing good-nature  that would have been, perhaps, surprising to a stranger who thought of him  only as a grim and mysterious discoverer of secrets and crimes. Indeed,  the man had always as little of the aspect of the conventional detective  as may be imagined. Nobody could appear more cordial or less observant in  manner, although there was to be seen a certain sharpness of the  eye--which might, after all, only be the twinkle of good humor.    I _did_ think it worth while to write something of Martin Hewitt's  investigations, and a description of one of his adventures follows.           *       *       *       *       *    At the head of the first flight of a dingy staircase leading up from an  ever-open portal in a street by the Strand stood a door, the dusty  ground-glass upper panel of which carried in its center the single word  \"Hewitt,\" while at its right-hand lower corner, in smaller letters,  \"Clerk's Office\" appeared. On a morning when the clerks in the  ground-floor offices had barely hung up their hats, a short, well-dressed  young man, wearing spectacles, hastening to open the dusty door, ran into  the arms of another man who suddenly issued from it.    \"I beg pardon,\" the first said. \"Is this Hewitt's Detective Agency  Office?\"    \"Yes, I believe you will find it so,\" the other replied. He was a  stoutish, clean-shaven man, of middle height, and of a cheerful, round  countenance. \"You'd better speak to the clerk.\"    In the little outer office the visitor was met by a sharp lad with inky  fingers, who presented him with a pen and a printed slip. The printed slip  having been filled with the visitor's name and present business, and  conveyed through an inner door, the lad reappeared with an invitation to  the private office. There, behind a writing-table, sat the stoutish man  himself, who had only just advised an appeal to the clerk.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Lloyd--Mr. Vernon Lloyd,\" he said, affably, looking  again at the slip. \"You'll excuse my care to start even with my  visitors--I must, you know. You come from Sir James Norris, I see.\"    \"Yes; I am his secretary. I have only to ask you to go straight to Lenton  Croft at once, if you can, on very important business. Sir James would  have wired, but had not your precise address. Can you go by the next  train? Eleven-thirty is the first available from Paddington.\"    \"Quite possibly. Do you know any thing of the business?\"    \"It is a case of a robbery in the house, or, rather, I fancy, of several  robberies. Jewelry has been stolen from rooms occupied by visitors to the  Croft. The first case occurred some months ago--nearly a year ago, in  fact. Last night there was another. But I think you had better get the  details on the spot. Sir James has told me to telegraph if you are coming,  so that he may meet you himself at the station; and I must hurry, as his  drive to the station will be rather a long one. Then I take it you will  go, Mr. Hewitt? Twyford is the station.\"    \"Yes, I shall come, and by the 11.30. Are you going by that train  yourself?\"    \"No, I have several things to attend to now I am in town. Good-morning; I  shall wire at once.\"    Mr. Martin Hewitt locked the drawer of his table and sent his clerk for a  cab.    At Twyford Station Sir James Norris was waiting with a dog-cart. Sir James  was a tall, florid man of fifty or thereabout, known away from home as  something of a county historian, and nearer his own parts as a great  supporter of the hunt, and a gentleman much troubled with poachers. As  soon as he and Hewitt had found one another the baronet hurried the  detective into his dog-cart. \"We've something over seven miles to drive,\"  he said, \"and I can tell you all about this wretched business as we go.  That is why I came for you myself, and alone.\"    Hewitt nodded.    \"I have sent for you, as Lloyd probably told you, because of a robbery at  my place last evening. It appears, as far as I can guess, to be one of  three by the same hand, or by the same gang. Late yesterday afternoon----\"    \"Pardon me, Sir James,\" Hewitt interrupted, \"but I think I must ask you to  begin at the first robbery and tell me the whole tale in proper order. It  makes things clearer, and sets them in their proper shape.\"    \"Very well! Eleven months ago, or thereabout, I had rather a large party  of visitors, and among them Colonel Heath and Mrs. Heath--the lady being a  relative of my own late wife. Colonel Heath has not been long retired, you  know--used to be political resident in an Indian native state. Mrs. Heath  had rather a good stock of jewelry of one sort and another, about the most  valuable piece being a bracelet set with a particularly fine pearl--quite  an exceptional pearl, in fact--that had been one of a heap of presents  from the maharajah of his state when Heath left India.    \"It was a very noticeable bracelet, the gold setting being a mere  feather-weight piece of native filigree work--almost too fragile to trust  on the wrist--and the"]]]
