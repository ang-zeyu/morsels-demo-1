These picture's have  been so arranged as to bring out in natural succession typical  situations in the career of an individual from the cradle to the grave.  In order not to interrupt this succession, Auerbach's _Little Barefoot_,  likewise illustrated by Vautier, has been placed before Gotthelf's _Uli,  The Farmhand_, although Gotthelf, and not Auerbach, is to be considered  as the real founder of the German village story.    The frontispiece, Karl Spitzweg's _Garret Window_, introduces a master  of German genre painting who in a later volume will be more fully  represented.    KUNO FRANCKE.           *       *       *       *          THE NOVEL OF PROVINCIAL LIFE      By EDWIN C. ROEDDER, PH.D.    Associate Professor of German Philology, University of Wisconsin    To Rousseau belongs the credit of having given, in his passionate cry  \"Back to Nature!\" the classic expression to the consciousness that all  the refinements of civilization do not constitute life in its truest  sense. The sentiment itself is thousands of years old. It had inspired  the idyls of Theocritus in the midst of the magnificence and luxury of  the courts of Alexandria and Syracuse. It reechoed through the pages of  Virgil's bucolic poetry. It made itself heard, howsoever faintly, in the  artificiality and sham of the pastoral plays from the sixteenth to the  eighteenth century. And it was but logical that this sentiment should  seek its most adequate and definitive expression in a portrayal of all  phases of the life and fate of those who, as the tillers of the soil,  had ever remained nearer to Mother Earth than the rest of humankind.    Not suddenly, then, did rural poetry rise into being; but while its  origin harks back to remote antiquity it has found its final form only  during the last century. In this its last, as well as its most vigorous,  offshoot, it presents itself as the village story--as we shall term it  for brevity's sake--which has won a permanent place in literature by the  side of its older brothers and sisters, and has even entirely driven out  the fanciful pastoral or village idyl of old.    The village story was bound to come in the nineteenth century, even if  there had been no beginnings of it in earlier times, and even if it did  not correspond to a deep-rooted general sentiment. The eighteenth  century had allowed the Third Estate to gain a firm foothold in the  domain of dignified letters; the catholicity of the nineteenth admitted  the laborer and the proletarian. It would have been passing strange if  the rustic alone had been denied the privilege. An especially hearty  welcome was accorded to the writings of the first representatives of the  new species. Internationalism, due to increased traffic, advanced with  unparalleled strides in the third and fourth decades. The seclusion of  rural life seemed to remain the quiet and unshakable realm of  patriarchal virtue and venerable tradition. The political skies were  overcast with the thunder clouds of approaching revolutions; France had  just passed through another violent upheaval. Village conditions seemed  to offer a veritable haven of refuge. The pristine artlessness of the  peasant's intellectual, moral, and emotional life furnished a wholesome  antidote to the morbid hyperculture of dying romanticism, the  controversies and polemics of Young Germany, and the self-adulation of  the society of the salons. Neither could the exotic, ethnographic, and  adventure narratives in the manner of Sealsfield, at first  enthusiastically received, satisfy the taste of the reading public for  any length of time--at best, these novels supplanted one fashion by  another, if, indeed, they did not drive out Satan by means of Beelzebub.  And was it wise to roam so far afield when the real good was so close at  hand? Why cross oceans when the land of promise lay right before one's  doors? All that was needed was the poet discoverer.    The Columbus of this new world shared the fate of the great Genoese in  more than one respect. Like him, he set out in quest of shores that he  was destined never to reach. Like him, he discovered, or rather  rediscovered, a new land. Like him, he so far outstripped his  forerunners that they sank into oblivion. Like Columbus, who died  without knowing that he had not reached India, the land of his dreams,  but found a new world, he may have departed from this life in the belief  that he had been a measurably successful social reformer when he had  proved to be a great epic poet. Like Columbus, he was succeeded by his  Amerigo Vespucci, after whom his discovery was named. The Columbus of  the village story is the Swiss clergyman Albert Bitzius, better known by  his assumed name as Jeremias Gotthelf; the Amerigo Vespucci is his  contemporary Berthold Auerbach.    The choice of his _nom de guerre_ is significant of Jeremias Gotthelf's  literary activity. He regarded himself as the prophet wailing the misery  of his people, who could be delivered only through the aid of the  Almighty. It never occurred to him to strive for literary fame. He  considered himself as a teacher and preacher purely and simply; in a  measure, as the successor of Pestalozzi, who, in his _Lienhard und  Gertrud_ (1781-1789), had created a sort of pedagogical classic for the  humbler ranks of society; and if there be such a thing in Gotthelf's  make-up as literary influence, it must have emanated from the sage of  Burgdorf and Yverdun. To some extent also Johann Peter Hebel  (1760-1826), justly famed for his Alemannian dialect poems, may have  served him as a model, for Hebel followed an avowedly educational  purpose in the popular tales of his _Schatzkaestlein des rheinischen  Hausfreunds_ (\"Treasure Box of the Rhenish Crony\"), of which it has been  said that they outweigh tons of novels.    Gotthelf's intention was twofold: to champion the cause of the rustic  yeomanry in the threatening of its peculiar existence--for the radical  spirit of the times was already seizing and preying upon the hallowed  customs of the peasantry's life--and to fight against certain inveterate  vices of the rural population itself that seemed to be indigenous to the  soil. As the first great social writer of the German tongue, he is not  content to make the rich answerable for existing conditions, but labors  with all earnestness to educate the lower classes toward self-help. At  first he appeared as an uncommonly energetic, conservative, polemic  author in whose views the religious, basis of life and genuine moral  worth coincided with the traditional character of the country yeomanry.  A more thorough examination revealed to his readers an original epic  talent of stupendous powers. He was indeed eminently fitted to be an  educator and reformer among his flock by his own nobility of character,  his keen knowledge and sane judgment of the people's real needs and  wants, his warm feeling, and his unexcelled insight into the peasant's  inner life. Beyond that, however, he was gifted with exuberant poetic  imagination and creative power, with an intuitive knowledge of the  subtlest workings of the emotional life, and a veritable genius for  finding the critical moments in an individual existence.    So it came about that the poet triumphed over the social reformer, in  spite of himself; and while in his own parish, at Luetzelflueh in the  Canton of Berne--where he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12574"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Although the reader will scarcely fail to recognise the typographical  amendments contemplated in the Preface to our last volume, we may be  allowed to point attention to the most important change. To give our souls  \"elbow-room,\" we have widened our columns so as to add upwards of two  pages throughout each sheet of our future volumes: that is sixteen pages  of the size of the present will be found to contain as much as eighteen  pages the size of those in our last volume. But the page has not been  widened like the citizen's back--at the expense of the corporation--or of  the public. The whole of the type is new, having been cast, as the  prospectus says, expressly for this work; its face is as brilliant as our  hopes, and so, now, with the reader's permission, Flow on thou shining  river.]    We commenced our last volume with three Vignette Views in the Surrey  Zoological Gardens. The season was then cold and ungenial, the trees  leafless; in short, it was about mid-winter, but the magic pencil of our  artist invested his scenes with all the pride of summer. Upon the present  occasion, our Engravings need not the aid of his creative fancy. The  Gardens are now      made glorious by the summer sun    --the weather and the public are all propitious, and hundreds of gaily  dressed folks are flocking to inspect the zoological and botanical  curiosities of the place.    During the six months since our last visit, Mr. Cross has been  indefatigable. The grounds have been laid out under the superintendance of  Mr. Henry Phillips, the author of _Sylva Florifera_, and it is almost  impossible to give the reader an idea of their beauty and variety. The  avenues to the various buildings are planted with forest-trees, and each  tree and new plant has its name affixed on a tally; a botanical garden, on  a small scale, is, moreover talked of.    But we are forgetting the zoological tenants. The visiter enters by a  broad walk, beside which Parrots, Maccaws, and Cockatoos are uncaged on  perches; so that we may almost say with Montgomery:--      The blossoms swung like blossoms on the trees.    To the right is a semicircular glazed house containing many beautiful  foreign birds, and two Boas, which, from their torpidity, appear nearly as  harmless as their shaggy namesakes that encircle many a fair neck. The  movable aviaries are too numerous to describe; but we must notice, in one  of them, a fine pair of Great Crowned Pigeons from New Guinea; their front  colour is a bright slate, as is that of their crests of fine silky  feathers. We next pass the circular Confectionary room, and reach the  curvilinear glazed building of 300 feet in diameter. (_See the Cut_.) This  has been planned by Mr. Henry Phillips; of the execution we spoke in _The  Mirror_, No. 528. There are four entrances to this well-contrived building.  Immediately within the wall, and all throughout the circle, is a channel  of water containing gold and silver fish; from the margin of which plants  are to be trained up within the glass. Next is a circular range of seats,  then a broad walk, and in the centre of the building are placed the cages  of carnivorous quadrupeds, as Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Hyaenas, &c. The  Lions are especially worth notice: they are African and Asiatic, and the  contrast between a pair from the country of the Persian Gulf with their  African neighbours, is very striking. A sleek Lynx from Persia, with its  exquisite tufted ears, and a docile Puma, will receive the distant  caresses of visiters. The fronts of the cages are ornamented with painted  rock-work, and our artist has endeavoured to convey an idea of the lordly  Lion in his embellished dwelling. The whole building is admirably  ventilated.    Another addition is an octagonal walled enclosure, the entrances to which  are surmounted by pairs of magnificent horns. Here are cages for large  birds, as the Ostrich, Emu, and Cassowary; and foreign _pecora_, as the  Llama and Camel, and a pair of Gnus of great beauty.    Next is an enclosure containing two pair of fine Pelicans, and the  solitary kennels of an Alpine and Cuban Dog: the Armadillo house, with a  pair of eight-banded inmates: near the latter a sty or cage is preparing  for Porcupines. At this extremity of the grounds, is the Deer paddock,  with about forty specimens, among which the Axis or spotted varieties are  very beautiful. We now reach a picturesque group of rock-work, (_See the  third Cut_), the lower part of which is intended for Beavers, the upper  craigs being at present occupied by Vultures and Eagles. The rock-work  consists chiefly of granite, with a few masses of the rock of Gibraltar.    Of the lake, hermitage, and boathouse we have already spoken. The long, or  rather semicircular, glazed building is now finished for the Monkeys, as  is an adjoining house for large birds of prey: here we should notice a  fine Ruppell Vulture, from Senegal, (named after Major Ruppell, the  celebrated traveller in Africa,) a chanting Falcon from Brazil, and a  white Hawk, from New Holland, the latter especially rare in this country.    Among the improvements we ought not to omit the affixing of the scientific  and popular names to the abodes of the respective animals. This is one of  the beneficial results of the honorary aid of Messrs. Swainson and Gray,  the distinguished zoologists.    By the way, there has been in these grounds a Fancy Fair with the laudable  object of aiding the funds for the repair of the Ladye Chapel of St.  Saviour's Southwark. We anxiously hope the _faire ladyes_ were successful  in their appeal to the fancy of their visiters.           *       *       *       *       *      THE LATE MR. COLTON.    (_To the Editor_.)      Having observed in several papers and periodicals, (amongst which is _The  Mirror_, No. 553,) sketches of \"the late Mr. Colton,\" and none of these  tending, in my opinion, to convey a correct idea of the character of this  extraordinary man; allow me to offer you a slight sketch of the latter  period of his life.    I am aware I shall be met by many with the squeamish proverb, _De mortuis  nil nisi bonum_; though I am not disposed at this moment to enter on a  discussion of the merits of this received axiom. Shakspeare tells us \"The  evil that men do, lives after them.\"    Mr. Colton, or as he was vulgarly called, Parson Colton, arrived in Paris  in the year 1825 or 1826, from America, to which country he sailed from  England shortly previous to the murder of Weare. He was at that time in  possession of very little money; this small stock he increased by  borrowing upon the security of some valuable jewellery which he took out  from his creditors in this country. With this sum he commenced his career  as player at the public gaming-tables in Paris, more particularly that at  154 in the Palais Royal. The system upon which he played was at once bold  and original, and attended with great success. I have good authority (his  own) for stating, he was at one period a winner of upwards of L10,000. He  subsequently lost nearly half this sum, and he expended the remainder in  paintings by the ancient masters, of which, in the year 1828, he had a  splendid collection. These pictures he intended for the English market;  but in the latter part of the same year, he became unfortunate at the  gambling tables, and they were parted with by degress, the proceeds lost,  and their late owner, in a short time, reduced to beggary, or nearly so.  His last literary labour, if it is worthy of the name, was a history of  the Three Days of July, published by Galignani.    In person, Mr. Colton was ungainly; he stooped much, his gait was slovenly,  and his dress mean and dirty; the reason he assigned for not removing the  dirt that accumulated on the lower part of his trousers and upon his boots,  was that none but shoeblacks looked below the knee in so dirty a city as  Paris. As if fond of contradiction, he wore at the same time a ridiculous  superfluity of jewellery; his unwashed hands were adorned with rings, and  his shirt, which probably had not visited his _blanchisseuse_ for a  fortnight, was garnished with numerous brooches and pins of considerable  value. A heavy gold chain secured his watch in his waistcoat pocket, and  he carried two massive gold boxes, one for snuff, though he took none  himself, and the other for tobacco. His face was pale and emaciated, the  cheek bones being remarkably prominent; his left arm was considerably  contracted, as he was fond of saying, from a pistol wound received in a  duel. His habits were low; when not at the gaming house, he was to be  found in one of the lower English houses, smoking and drinking,  entertaining his pot companions, and acting what is vulgarly called, the  \"king of the company.\" He possessed a fund of anecdote and wit, and had  his manners been more polished, and his character less exceptionable, his  society would doubtless have been much courted.    His lodgings, which were in the Palais Royal, above the Cafe Phoenix, were  particularly filthy; his bedroom, into which all visiters were shown, was  truly disgusting; though he had at the same time two sitting-rooms,  handsomely furnished, which were constantly locked, and into which he  himself perhaps did not enter once in a month. An anecdote, which he  related to me, will tend to illustrate his character and style of living.  A pair of his pantaloons became much worn in the pockets, and he took them  to a tailor to be repaired. They were brought home when he was absent, and  left below with the porter, who"]]]
