First, we have the precocious boyhood,  with its eager response to the intellectual stimulation of cultured  parents; young Bret Harte assimilated Greek with amazing facility;  devoured voraciously the works of Shakespeare, Dickens, Irving,  Froissart, Cervantes, Fielding; and, with creditable success, attempted  various forms of composition. Then, compelled by economic necessity, he  left school at thirteen, and for three years worked first in a lawyer's  office, and then in a merchant's counting house.    The second period, that of his migration to California, includes all  that is permanently valuable of Harte's literary output. Arriving in  California in 1854, he was, successively, a school-teacher, drug-store  clerk, express messenger, typesetter, and itinerant journalist. He  worked for a while on the NORTHERN CALIFORNIA (from which he was  dismissed for objecting editorially to the contemporary California sport  of murdering Indians), then on the GOLDEN ERA, 1857, where he achieved  his first moderate acclaim. In this latter year he married Anne Griswold  of New York. In 1864 he was given the secretaryship of the California  mint, a virtual sinecure, and he was enabled do a great deal of writing.  The first volume of his poems, THE LOST GALLEON AND OTHER TALES,  CONDENSED NOVELS (much underrated parodies), and THE BOHEMIAN PAPERS  were published in 1867. One year later, THE OVERLAND MONTHLY, which  had aspirations of becoming \"the ATLANTIC MONTHLY of the West,\" was  established, and Harte was appointed its first editor. For it, he wrote  most of what still remains valid as literature--THE LUCK OF ROARING  CAMP, THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT, PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES,  among others. The combination of Irvingesque romantic glamor and  Dickensian bitter-sweet humor, applied to picturesquely novel material,  with the addition of a trick ending, was fantastically popular. Editors  began to clamor for his stories; the University of California appointed  him Professor of recent literature; and the ATLANTIC MONTHLY offered him  the practically unprecedented sum of $10,000 for exclusive rights to one  year's literary output. Harte's star was, briefly, in the ascendant.    However, Harte had accumulated a number of debts, and his editorial  policies, excellent in themselves, but undiplomatically executed, were  the cause of a series of arguments with the publisher of the OVERLAND  MONTHLY. Fairly assured of profitable pickings in the East, he  left California (permanently, as it proved). The East, however, was  financially unappreciative. Harte wrote an unsuccessful novel and  collaborated with Mark Twain on an unremunerative play. His attempts  to increase his income by lecturing were even less rewarding. From  his departure from California in 1872 to his death thirty years later,  Harte's struggles to regain financial stability were unremitting: and  to these efforts is due the relinquishment of his early ideal of \"a  peculiarly characteristic Western American literature.\" Henceforth Harte  accepted, as Prof. Hicks remarks, \"the role of entertainer, and as an  entertainer he survived for thirty years his death as an artist.\"    The final period extends from 1878, when he managed to get himself  appointed consul to Crefeld in Germany, to 1902, when he died of a  throat cancer. He left for Crefeld without his wife or son--perhaps  intending, as his letters indicate, to call them to him when  circumstances allowed; but save for a few years prior to his death, the  separation, for whatever complex of reasons, remained permanent. Harte,  however, continued to provide for them as liberally as he was able. In  Crefeld Harte wrote A LEGEND OF SAMMERSTANDT, VIEWS FROM A GERMAN SPION,  and UNSER KARL. In 1880 he transferred to the more lucrative consulship  of Glasgow, and ROBIN GRAY, a tale of Scottish life, is the product of  his stay there. In 1885 he was dismissed from his consulship, probably  for political reasons, though neglect of duty was charged against him.  He removed to London where he remained, for most part, until his death.    Bret Harte never really knew the life of the mining camp. His mining  experiences were too fragmentary, and consequently his portraits of  mining life are wholly impressionistic. \"No one,\" Mark Twain wrote,  \"can talk the quartz dialect correctly without learning it with pick and  shovel and drill and fuse.\" Yet, Twain added elsewhere, \"Bret Harte got  his California and his Californians by unconscious absorption, and put  both of them into his tales alive.\" That is, perhaps, the final comment.  Much could be urged against Harte's stories: the glamor they throw over  the life they depict is largely fictitious; their pathetic endings  are obviously stylized; their technique is overwhelmingly derivative.  Nevertheless, so excellent a critic as Chesterton maintained that \"There  are more than nine hundred and ninety-nine excellent reasons which  we could all have for admiring the work of Bret Harte.\" The figure is  perhaps exaggerated, but there are many reasons for admiration. First,  Harte originated a new and incalculably influential type of story: the  romantically picturesque \"human-interest\" story. \"He created the local  color story,\" Prof. Blankenship remarks, \"or at least popularized  it, and he gave new form and intent to the short story.\" Character  motivating action is central to this type of story, rather than mood  dominating incident. Again Harte's style is really an eminently skilful  one, admirably suited to his subjects. He can manage the humorous or the  pathetic excellently, and his restraint in each is more remarkable than  his excesses. His sentences have both force and flow; his backgrounds  are crisply but carefully sketched; his characters and caricatures have  their own logical consistency. Finally, granted the desirability of the  theatric finale, it is necessary to admit that Harte always rings down  his curtain dramatically and effectively.    ARTHUR ZEIGER, M.A.          THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP      There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been a fight,  for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire  settlement. The ditches and claims were not only deserted, but \"Tuttle's  grocery\" had contributed its gamblers, who, it will be remembered,  calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot  each other to death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp  was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing.  Conversation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman  was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the  camp,--\"Cherokee Sal.\"    Perhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse and, it is to  be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was the only woman  in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore extremity, when she  most needed the ministration of her own sex. Dissolute, abandoned, and  irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear  even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood, but now terrible in her  loneliness. The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation  which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so  dreadful. It was, perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin that, at a  moment when she most lacked her sex's intuitive tenderness and care, she  met only the half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet  a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings. Sandy  Tipton thought it was \"rough on Sal,\" and, in the contemplation of her  condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and  two bowers in his sleeve.    It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no  means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had  been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of  return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB  INITIO. Hence the excitement.    \"You go in there, Stumpy,\" said a prominent citizen known as \"Kentuck,\"  addressing one of the loungers. \"Go in there, and see what you kin do.  You've had experience in them things.\"    Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other climes,  had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was owing to  some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp--a city of  refuge--was indebted to his company. The crowd approved the choice, and  Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority. The door closed on the  extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked  its pipe, and awaited the issue.    The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two of these  were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and all were  reckless. Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives  and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael face, with a profusion  of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the melancholy air and  intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the coolest and most courageous  man was scarcely over five feet in height, with a soft voice and an  embarrassed, timid manner. The term \"roughs\" applied to them was a  distinction rather than a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by Col Choat          PRODUCTION NOTES:    Notes referred to in the book (*) are shown in square brackets ([])  at the end of the paragraph in which the note is indicated.    Italics are indicated by underscore characters (_) at the  start and finish of the italicised words.    References to the charts have been retained though, of course,  the charts are not present in the text only version of the ebook.    The original punctuation and spelling and the use of italics and capital  letters to highlight words and phrases have, for the most part, been  retained. I think they help maintain the \"feel\" of the book, which was  published nearly 200 years ago. Flinders notes in the preface that \"I  heard it declared that a man who published a quarto volume without an  index ought to be set in the pillory, and being unwilling to incur the  full rigour of this sentence, a running title has been affixed to all the  pages; on one side is expressed the country or coast, and on the opposite  the particular part where the ship is at anchor or which is the immediate  subject of examination; this, it is hoped, will answer the main purpose  of an index, without swelling the volumes.\" This treatment is, of course,  not possible, where there are no defined pages. However, Flinders' page  headings are included at appropriate places where they seem relevant.  These, together with the Notes which, in the book, appear in the margin,  are represented as line headings with a blank line before and after them.
