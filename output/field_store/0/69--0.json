X, NO. 271.] SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1827. [PRICE 2d.        The New Prison, Norwich.      [Illustration: The New Prison, Norwich]      The old gaol in the city of Norwich, in the year 1823, being found no  longer secure, nor according to the new act of parliament, admitting of  sufficient room for the classification of the prisoners, the magistrates  came to a resolution of erecting a new one outside the city, near St.  Giles's gates; the same was accordingly advertised in the Norwich  papers, in which architects were requested to send plans, elevations,  and sections, (in competition,) accompanied with an estimate of the  total expense of the new building. A great number of designs were in  consequence submitted, when the plan sent by Mr. Brown, of Wells-street,  Oxford-street, London, was adjudged to be the best: his plan was  therefore adopted and carried into execution, of which the annexed  engraving is a faithful representation, taken from the tower of St.  Giles's Church, in the city of Norwich. The foundation stone was laid in  1824, and the building finished this year, 1827. It is designed to hold  120 prisoners, besides the necessary turnkeys and servants, and has cost  the city L23,000; the boundary wall is quadrangular, but is cut off at  the junction of the four angles by bastions, thereby giving to the wall  a greater stability; the whole circumference is 1,220 feet, and encloses  an area of one acre, two roods, and thirty-four poles, being nearly one  acre and three quarters of ground.    The bastion at the entrance contains on the ground floor a porter's  room, press room, hot and cold baths, and a room with an oven for the  purpose of purifying foul linen. The upper story contains over the  entrance gate the drop room: on each side are receiving cells, two for  males and two for females, a searching room for the surgeon, and the  prison wardrobe; directly over the drop room on the lead flat is the  place where the more heinous malefactors expiate their crimes. The  bastion on the right hand contains a building, on the ground floor and  in the centre of which is the wash-house and laundry, and in front the  drying ground; at each end of this building are the airing grounds for  the sick prisoners, and on the second floor are the male and female  infirmaries, separated by a strong partition wall. The left hand bastion  contains the millhouse, stable, and a room for the van which takes the  prisoners to the town hall in the assize time; over these three rooms  are the mill chamber and hay-loft. The horizontal wind vane on the roof  of this building is to assist the prisoners when there is not a  sufficiency of them sentenced to the tread-wheels; by shutting the  louvre boards of the arms it then produces employment for the prisoners  when there is no corn in the mill to grind. In the remote bastion are  seen the tread-wheels on which the prisoners are employed in keeping up  a constant retrograde motion, which works the machinery in the millhouse  by means of an iron shaft with universal joints concealed below the  surface of the ground.    Here are four prison wings in the building, the right hand one contains  in one ward common debtors, and in the other unconvicted men felons, not  capital. The second wing on the right contains on one side unconvicted  men felons, and unconvicted women felons for capital offences on the  other. In the first left hand wing there is on the first side the master  debtors, and on the other the court of conscience debtors; the second  wing on the left contains on one side men misdemeanors, and on the other  convicted men felons. There are two day-rooms in each of the four wings,  and four condemned cells and four solitary ones in the back towers;  there is also fourteen airing yards between the four wings, six of which  are sunk three feet below the others, to enable the governor from the  inspection gallery of his house to overlook the tread-wheels, millhouse,  and infirmary; those yards are descended by stone steps, in each there  is a day room, and they are appropriated to the following prisoners,  namely, women debtors, unconvicted women felons, not capital; convicted  women felons, women fines, men fines, and boys for misdemeanors. There  is also a level passage between each two of the sunk yards, one leading  to the infirmary, one to the millhouse, and the other to the  tread-wheels.    In the governor's house there is in the basement story a kitchen,  scullery, and bakehouse, store room, beer-cellar, and coal cellar; on  the ground floor is the governor's office, living room, committee room,  and matron's room; on the second floor are two bedrooms and the lower  part of the chapel; and on the third floor are two bedrooms and the  gallery of the chapel. There are likewise four bridge staircases, one  from each prison wing leading to passages in the governor's house, which  communicates with the chapel; the prisoners are not here able to see  each others' class, as they are separated by fourteen partitions, being  as many as there are yards in the prison, yet the governor and minister  have from their seats a complete view of every person and every part.  Around the governor's house is an enclosed area, and above an inspection  gallery, from which the governor is enabled to see into every part of  the prison. On the towers of the four prison wings there are reservoirs  for containing water, which is thrown up by a pump worked by the  prisoners at the tread-wheel, whenever water is required, and by means  of lead pipes, it is then conveyed to every part of the prison. The  whole gaol is fire-proof, the floors being of stone, and the doors and  windows of iron.    There is certainly a peculiar arrangement in the plan of this gaol not  to be met with in any other in the kingdom; there are four yards between  each of the wings excepting those two in the approach to the governor's  house; the middle yards which are divided by a passage, have, as before  stated, each of them a day-room. The prisoners allotted to these yards  have their sleeping cells in the main wing, to which they are conducted  along a passage, at the end of those upper yards which join the prison  wing; the prisoners are therefore in their passage to and from the  sleeping cells, concealed from the others; should there at any time be  a greater number of prisoners belonging to the ward on the ground floor  than there are sleeping cells they are then taken to the spare cells in  the wards above through a door at the end of the upper yard, and yet  concealed from those classes in the sunk yards. All our prison buildings  hitherto erected are hid from the sight by the high boundary wall that  encloses them, producing nothing interesting to the citizen or the  traveller but a monotonous facade. Mr. Brown has obviated this in the  gaol before us, by having raised towers on the ends of the four wings,  which, with the top of the governor's house, mill, and infirmary, being  seen rising above the boundary wall and entrance front, produces to the  eye of the spectator on approaching the prison a _tout ensemble_ truly  imposing and grand.    ARCHITECTUS.           *       *       *       *       *          LIVING AUTHORS.    No. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    BERNARD BARTON.        \"Sheltered, but not to social duties lost;    Secluded, but not buried; and with song    Cheering his days.\"      The productions of Mr. Barton are doubtless familiar to most of our  readers, and from them they have learnt much of the amiable turn of  the poet's character. Mr. Barton's compositions afford indications of  genuine feeling, of deep affection, of benevolence, sympathy, taste, and  integrity; he seems to have an ear ever on the listen for the accents of  charity, patriotism, and religion; where human anguish causes the tear  to start, there he would fain be to soothe and alleviate. Such is the  character of the poet, and in the following sketch such will be proved  to be the character of the man.    Bernard Barton was born in the vicinity of London, on the 31st of  January, 1784. His father was in trade in the metropolis, whither he had  come from his native place, Carlisle. Bernard had the misfortune to lose  his mother one month after his birth: her maiden name was Mary Done, and  she was a native of Rockcliffe, Cumberland; she died at the early age of  thirty-two. The following lines _To a Profile_ evince the feelings with  which our poet still cherishes her memory, or rather the recollection of  what has been told him respecting her:--        \"I knew thee not! then wherefore gaze      Upon thy silent shadow there,    Which so imperfectly portrays      The form thy features used to wear?    Yet have I often looked at thee,    As if those lips could speak to me.      I knew thee not! and thou couldst know,      At best, but little more of one    Whose pilgrimage on earth below      Commenced, just ere thy own was done;    For few and fleeting days were thine,    To hope or fear for lot of mine.      Yet few and fleeting as they were,      Fancy and feeling picture this,    They prompted many a fervent prayer,      Witnessed, perchance, a parting kiss;    And might not kiss, and prayer, from thee,    At such a period, profit me?      Whether they did or not, I owe      At least this tribute to thy worth;    Though little all I _can_ bestow,      Yet fond affection gives it birth;    And prompts me, as thy shade I view,    To bless thee, whom I never knew!\"[1]      His father died before Mr. Barton was seven years old; but his second  marriage, which took place a few months before his death, provided an  excellent parent for his children: to her, and to his two sisters,[2]  both several years older than himself, our author owed infinite  obligations.    His education at one of the quaker seminaries was, of course, plain and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11405"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

VOL. 12, NO. 342.] SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1828. [PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *        [Illustration: COUNCIL OFFICE, &c. WHITEHALL. ]      COUNCIL OFFICE, &c. WHITEHALL.      From the Druids' Temple, at Abury, (our last engraving,) to the Council  Office, at Whitehall, is a long stride in the march of time. From \"grave  to gay, and lively to severe,\" is nothing to it; but variety is the  public dictum; and with more sincerity than the courtier in _Tom Thumb_,  we say to the public,        \"Whate'er your majesty shall please to name,    Long cut or short cut, to us' tis all the same.\"      On the annexed page is represented the new splendid range of buildings,  including the _Council Office_, _Board of Trade_, &c. at  Whitehall. The architect, Mr. Soane, has adapted the facade from the  Temple of Jupiter Stator, at Rome.[1]    But Mr. Soane's adaptation has been only partial, and he has adhered  merely to the details of the columns and entablature. \"The facade,\" it is  well observed in an early Number of the _Athenaeum_, \"enjoys one of  the most favourable sites for the display of a public building which the  metropolis affords; no limit has been set to the expense; the finest  materials the country yields have been used in its construction; the  richest example of the richest order which antiquity has left us, has  been lavishly employed in its decoration; and yet,\" continues the critic,  \"is not the whole a failure?\" He then describes the effect of it as \"poor,  or at best but pretty,\" and attributes the absence of grandeur to the  \"want of sufficient elevation.\"--\"To the general elevation it may be  objected, that it has no prominent centre; that, composed of two wings  and an intermediate space receding, it has more the character of a flank  than a front building; and that the want of a central entrance derogates  greatly from its dignity as a principal facade.\"    But we are mere amateurs in these matters, and it will be as well to  leave the remainder of this criticism to the more studious reader. We  have, however, glanced at the principal defects which the writer in the  _Athenaeum_ points out, and we are bound to admit the justice of his  remarks. The details which produce this effect would not be so generally  interesting. \"The order itself,\" says he, \"it must be admitted, is well  copied, and excellently executed;\" but Mr. Soane's application of it is  loudly censured--a Roman temple being inappropriate for a British Council  Office. Perhaps our critic would have preferred a facade like that of the  Palais de Justice at Paris,--a platform, ascended by an immense flight of  steps, which serves as a basement for a projecting body of four Doric  columns; with four large pedestals in front, and statues of _Strength_,  _Plenty_, _Justice_, and _Prudence_, as the cardinal virtues of English  legislation and trade.    Upon the whole, we cannot help thinking some of the details of this new  range extremely rich and pleasing, although we assent to the above  character of their general effect. The columns, of fluted Corinthian, and  the cornice of the order, are to us very beautiful; but the upper windows  are unsightly, or, as a wag would say, purely attic; and the entrances  are too strictly _official_ for the architecture of the building.  This brings us again to the inappropriateness of the adaptation, which  made these introductions unavoidable.[2]    The front of the building is not completed, the northern wing having yet  to be erected. When this is finished, the effect may be materially  assisted.    While we are in this quarter, and lest \"we may never come again,\" it may  be as well to thank our correspondent, \"An Architect,\" for his letter on  \"Whitehall,\" a very small portion of which has ever been completed. What  has been finished--the Banqueting House--is one of the triumphs of Inigo  Jones, but like all human works, is sadly dilapidated; although this is  attributable to the bad material, rather than to the interval since its  erection. The _whole_ was, indeed, a magnificent design.        [1] The portion of this temple which is still standing in the Campo          Vaccino, and which consists of three marble columns, with a          fragment of entablature, is universally acknowledged to be the          finest specimen, not only of the architecture of the Augustan          age, but of the Corinthian order, not merely in Rome, but          throughout the whole ancient world. Whether contemplated in the          original, or through the medium of drawings, it inspires          unequivocal admiration as a perfect model of the florid style:          and from the inferences deducible from the dimensions and          relative position of the three columns and their entablature,          it is clear that the elegance and propriety of their arrangement,          as members of an entire edifice, were equal to the grace of the          proportions of the still existing parts, and to the beauty,          however exquisite, of their enrichments.        [2] One of the most characteristic buildings recently erected in          the metropolis, was the ill-fated _Brunswick Theatre_, the          propriety of whose facade was universally acknowledged.           *       *       *       *       *      CROMLECH.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      In No. 328 of the MIRROR, you mistake in spelling _cromlech_; the  last syllable is always written _lech_, not _leh_; neither is  it derived from _crom_ and _leac_, the Irish, but from _crom_ and _llech_,  the Celtic, of which the Irish is the most corrupted, and the present  Welsh the most pure dialect. _Llech_ signifies a stone in Welsh, and is  pronounced in a way peculiar to the Welsh; when simple it is _llech_,  when compounded _lech_.    RUPERT C.           *       *       *       *       *      GARDEN OF HYACINTHS    IN THE SERAGLIO, CONSTANTINOPLE.    (_For the Mirror._)      In this garden the sultan passes most of his leisure hours, free from the  outward parade attendant on his rank. It is small, but tastefully  disposed in oblong beds, edged with fine porcelain; no plant is allowed  to grow in it except the hyacinth; whence the name of the garden and the  apartment it contains. Nothing can be more beautiful than the interior;  three sides are formed by a divan, the cushions and pillows of which were  of black satin, exquisitely embroidered. The floor was covered with  Gobelin tapestry, and the ceiling magnificently gilded and burnished.  Opposite the windows of the chamber was a fire-place, in the European  manner; and on each side a door, covered with hangings of crimson cloth.  Between each of these doors appeared a glass-case, containing the sultan's  private library; every volume was in manuscript, with the name written  on the edges of the leaves. Opposite the doors and fire-place hung three  gold cages, containing artificial birds, which sang by mechanism. On one  side was a raised bench, on which was placed an embroidered towel, a  splendid vase, and basin for washing the hands and beard; upon the wall  over it was suspended an embroidered portfolio, worked with silver on  yellow leather, to contain the petitions presented to the sultan when he  goes in procession to the mosque. Close to the door was placed a pair of  yellow boots and slippers, which are always at the entrance of every  apartment frequented by the sultan. Groups of arms, such as pistols,  sabres, and poniards, were displayed with great taste and effect on the  compartments of the walls; the handles were covered with diamonds and  jewels of large size, which, as they glittered around, gave an almost  dazzling brilliancy to this sumptuous chamber, thus characterizing the  amusements of the man when divested of the ceremony and formality of the  sultan.    INA.           *       *       *       *       *        NEEDLE-WORK ALTAR-PIECE.    _(For the Mirror.)_      The town of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, was the last place of residence of Dr.  Young, author of \"Night Thoughts,\" where he was rector. His pious lady  employed her leisure hours with her needle, in the completion of a most  elegant altar-piece, which now embellishes the sacramental table in the  church; and, through the care of the parish clerk, this specimen of the  indefatigable mind of Mrs. Young has been surprisingly preserved. The  words down the centre,        I AM    THE BREAD    OF    LIFE,      have the appearance of being the production of a most masterly pencil;  and the word \"life\" is in as fine a state of preservation as on the day  when it was first presented by the benevolent artist; every tint,  including the light and shade which surround the word, having withstood  the ravages of time, and been ingeniously preserved by a kind of gauze  covering.

It has not been till lately that any of the travellers into Palestine  have told what was meant by the locusts mentioned by St. Matthew as part  of the food of John the Baptist. Dr. Clarke first related, that a tree  grows in the Holy Land, which is called the locust tree, and produces an  eatable fruit; but this fact was well known to many who had been in the  Mediterranean. The tree grows in several of the countries which border  that sea. It has been found in much greater abundance in some parts of  the East Indies, whence it has now become an article of export. Many  thousands of its pods are annually imported by the East India Company;  and, either because the"]]]
