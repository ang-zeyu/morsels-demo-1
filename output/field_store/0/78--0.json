ROYAL INSTITUTION.]      PUBLIC BUILDINGS OF MANCHESTER.      The annexed Engravings are important illustrations of the statement in  a recent _Edinburgh Review:_[1]--that Lancashire from being amongst the  most backward parts of England, has _worked_ its way into the front  rank. They are, however, not only characteristic of the public spirit  which animates the whole county; but they are monuments of commercial  wealth, active benevolence, and intellectual superiority, of which the  Manchesterians have ample cause to be proud. It will be seen from their  details, that the structures have been built within the last half  century, at an expense of more than one hundred thousand pounds; while  their association with the fame and fortunes of men illustrious in  science[2] will render the subjoined Engravings of no common interest.  The details which follow have been abridged from Lewis's Topographical  Dictionary, 4to. 1831.        [1] Ed. Rev. No. 109--article \"Life and Writings of Dr. Currie.\" For          quotations from this paper, see \"Improvement of Lancashire,\" and          \"London and the Provinces compared\";--in _The Mirror_, vol. xix.        [2] DR. FERRIAR was physician to the Infirmary and Lunatic Asylum;          and the Royal Institution has been the area of the philosophical          labours of DALTON and HENRY.      THE TOWN-HALL    Is a noble and elegant edifice, erected under the superintendance and  from a design of Mr. Francis Goodwin, of London, in the Grecian style,  after the temple of Erectheus at Athens, with a beautiful tower and dome  in the centre, resembling the tower of Andronicus, called \"The Temple of  the Winds.\" The principal entrance is by a magnificent colonnade, with  a rich entablature, in front of which are sculptured representations of  the town of Manchester, and emblems of trade and commerce. In the wings  are niches for statues of Solon and Alfred; in the medallions of the  attic are busts in alto relievo of Pythagoras, Lycurgus, Hale, and  Locke. The building contains various apartments for conducting the  public business of the town: on the principal floor is a splendid room,  132 feet long, 43 ft. 8 in. wide, and 51-1/2 feet in height to the  centre of the principal dome. The room is divided into three parts by  two ranges of eight elegant Ionic pillars, so disposed that each may  form a separate apartment; the central part being lighted by a superb  dome, supported on 16 dwarf columns of scagliola marble, corresponding  with the exterior design of the tower. The style of the whole room is  that of chaste and classic beauty: the light is tastefully introduced  into the extreme sections of the great room by concealed skylights,  and through stained glass in the panels of the ceiling and the dome,  decorated to correspond with those that are not pierced for that  purpose. Three staircases lead to this splendid room, with the interior  of which the principal staircase is made to harmonize. The  foundation-stone of the building was laid August 19, 1822, by James  Brierley, Esq. Boroughreeve; and its expense is stated at 40,000_l_.      THE INFIRMARY    Was established in 1752, by Joseph Bancroft, Esq., in conjunction  with Charles White, Esq., M.D.; and in 1755, a building for the purpose  was erected by subscription. It has been liberally supported, and  since it was first opened for the reception of patients, has afforded  medical relief to more than half a million of the labouring class.  The buildings, which have been progressively enlarged, and to which  other establishments have been attached, contain 180 beds for the  accommodation of in-patients, with apartments for the officers and  attendants, and a surgery, library of medical books, committee-rooms,  and other offices; also a complete set of baths for the use of the  patients. The grounds are tastefully laid out in gravel-walks, lawns,  and parterres, and form a public promenade, to which a fine pool in  front of the buildings adds considerable beauty. A complete set of hot,  cold, vapour, and medicated baths has been fitted up here, with every  accommodation for the public use, the profits arising from which are  appropriated to the support of the institution. A Lunatic Asylum and  Hospital was founded in 1765, and the building was opened for the  reception of patients in the following year. The Dispensary was  established in 1792, and an edifice for its use erected by subscription  adjoining the Infirmary. In 1830, his Majesty, on the solicitation  of the chairman and committee, graciously became the patron of this  institution, which is now styled \"The Manchester Royal Infirmary,  Dispensary, Lunatic Hospital, and Asylum.\" The buildings for these  several uses being previously contiguous, an uniformity of design has  been given to them by facing the front and the north side with stone.  The plan comprehends a principal and a side front, of which the  elevation is strikingly elegant and imposing. (_See the Engraving._)  The principal front has in the centre a lofty and boldly projecting  portico of four fluted Ionic columns, 38 feet high, supporting a  pediment, of which the frieze and cornice are carried round the  building, the angles of which are ornamented with antae of appropriate  character: the side-front is of similar design, differing only in the  slighter projection of the portico, which has but two columns in the  centre, with engaged antae at the angles. The whole building is three  stories high above the basement, and the lower story is channelled in  horizontal lines.      THE ROYAL INSTITUTION    Embracing a variety of objects connected with the pursuits of literature  and science, and the cultivation of the fine arts, originated with a few  public-spirited individuals, in the year 1823, and was soon honoured  with the public, and finally, with royal, patronage, The building, which  has been erected from a design by Mr. Barry, of London, and is of a  durable and richly-coloured stone, from the vicinity of Colne, forms a  splendid addition to the architectural ornaments of the town. It is in  the Grecian style. The principal elevation, (_seen in the Engraving_)  towards Mosley-street, has a noble portico of six lofty columns of the  Ionic order, supporting a rich entablature and pediment in the centre,  on each side of which are columns and pilasters connecting it with the  wings. Above the doors and windows are panels for bas-reliefs symbolical  of the design of the Institution: the attic story of the hall has been  recently, or is to be, surmounted by a finely-sculptured figure of  Minerva. The area round the building is enclosed with a handsome iron  palisade on a lofty plinth of masonry, with pedestals at the angles  of the steps leading to the portico and side entrances. The centre  comprises the Hall and the Theatre; one of the wings is appropriated as  an Academy of the Fine Arts, with exhibition rooms, and the other as a  Museum of Natural History. The Hall which is wholly lighted from the  attic story, is 40 feet square, and 60 feet high; it contains a grand  staircase of stone, consisting of central and lateral nights, with  pedestals for sculptures, leading to a gallery on three sides of the  hall, supported on Doric pillars; and to the theatre, which is of a  semicircular form. On the gallery are entrances on each side leading  through corridors flanked with columns, into the exhibition-rooms in  each wing of the building; the ceiling of the Hall is richly-paneled in  deeply-recessed compartments, and beneath the attic windows is a rich  frieze for bas-reliefs. The Theatre will hold 600 persons, has a gallery  supported on columns of bronze, and the walls are decorated with engaged  columns, and with isolated columns in the angles: the ceiling is richly  paneled, and the theatre is lighted by a lantern, which, by machinery,  may be darkened instantaneously, at the will of the lecturer. There are  three exhibition rooms in each wing, which may be thrown into one. There  are also various rooms for the use of officers and others connected with  the Institution, to which access is obtained from the hall and other  parts of the building. The whole cost of this elegant pile is stated at  about 50,000_l_. The Institution is under the direction of a President,  twelve vice-presidents, and a committee, chosen from a body of nearly  700 hereditary and life governors, of whom the former are contributors  of forty, and the latter of twenty-five guineas each.    These Views are from well-executed engravings, by Fothergill, of  Manchester, which we recommend to the notice of tourists, for memoranda  of their visit, as well as of the due rank of Manchester among the  provincial towns of the United Kingdom.    Among the other public buildings of Manchester, are the Exchange, a  handsome Grecian structure; the Hall of the Literary and Philosophical  Society, universally known by its excellent published memoirs; the  Portico, and other public libraries; theatres, hospitals, churches,  bridges, &c.           *       *       *       *       *      PRAYER.--A FRAGMENT.

Fourth Avenue, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 77      \"I don't know exactly how old I am. I was six or seven when the war  ended. I member dis--my mother said I was born on Christmas day. Old  master was goin' to war and he told her to take good care of that  boy--he was goin' to make a fine little man.    \"Did I live up to it? I reckon I was bout as smart a man as you could  jump up. The work didn't get too hard for _me_. I farmed and I sawmilled  a lot. Most of my time was farmin'.    \"I been in Jefferson County all my life. I went to school three or four  sessions.    \"About the war, I member dis--I member they carried us to Camden and I  saw the guards. I'd say, 'Give me a pistol.' They'd say, 'Come back  tomorrow and we'll give you one.' They had me runnin' back there every  day and I never did get one. They was Yankee soldiers.    \"Our folks' master was William E. Johnson. Oh Lord, they was just as  good to us as could be to be under slavery.    \"After they got free my people stayed there a year or two and then our  master broke up and went back to South Carolina and the folks went in  different directions. Oh Lord, my parents sho was well treated. Yes  ma'm. If he had a overseer, he wouldn't low him to whip the folks. He'd  say, 'Just leave em till I come home.' Then he'd give em a light  breshin'.    \"My father run off and stay in the woods one or two months. Old master  say, 'Now, Jordan, why you run off? Now I'm goin' to give you a light  breshin' and don't you run off again.' But he'd run off again after  awhile.    \"He had one man named Miles Johnson just stayed in the woods so he put  him on the block and sold him.    \"I seed the Ku Klux. We colored folks had to make it here to Pine Bluff  to the county band. If the Rebels kotch you, you was dead.    \"Oh Lord yes, I voted. I voted the Publican ticket, they called it. You  know they had this Australia ballot. You was sposed to go in the caboose  and vote. They like to scared me to death one time. I had a description  of the man I wanted to vote for in my pocket and I was lookin' at it so  I'd be sure to vote for the right man and they caught me. They said,  'What you doin' there? We're goin' to turn you over to the sheriff after  election!' They had me scared to death. I hid out for a long time till I  seed they wasn't goin' to do nothin'.    \"My wife's brother was one of the judges of the election. Some of the  other colored folks was constables and magistrates--some of em are  now--down in the country.    \"I knew a lot about things but I knew I was in the United States and had  to bow to the law. There was the compromise they give the colored  folks--half of the offices and then they got em out afterwards. John M.  Clayton was runnin' for the senate and say he goin' to see the colored  people had equal rights, but they killed him as he was gwine through the  country speakin'.    \"The white people have treated me very well but they don't pay us enough  for our work--just enough to live on and hardly that. I can say with a  clear conscience that if it hadn't been for this relief, I don't know  what I'd do--I'm not able to work. I'm proud that God Almighty put the  spirit in the man (Roosevelt) to help us.\"          Interviewer: Mrs. Bernice Bowden  Person interviewed: Lizzie McCloud                      1203 Short 13th Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 120?      \"I was one of 'em bless your heart. Yes ma'm, Yes ma'm, I wouldn't tell  you a lie 'bout that. If I can't tell you the truth I'm not goin' tell  you nothin'!    \"Oh yes, I was a young lady in slavery times--bred and born in  Tennessee. Miss Lizzie and Marse John Williams--I belonged to them--sho  did! I was scared to death of the white folks. Miss Lizzie--she mean as  the devil. She wouldn't step her foot on the ground, she so rich. No  ma'm wouldn't put her foot on the ground. Have her carriage drive up to  the door and have that silk carpet put down for her to walk on. Yes  Lord. Wouldn't half feed us and they went and named me after her.    \"I know all about the stars fallin'. I was out in the field and just  come in to get our dinner. Got so dark and the stars begin to play  aroun'. Mistress say, 'Lizzie, it's the judgment.' She was just a  hollerin'. Yes ma'm I was a young woman. I been here a long time, yes  ma'm, I been here a long time. Worked and whipped, too. I run off many a  time. Run off to see my mammy three or four miles from where I was.    \"I never was sold but they took we young women and brought us down in  the country to another plantation where they raised corn, wheat, and  hay. Overseer whipped us too. Marse John had a brother named Marse  Andrew and he was a good man. He'd say to the overseer, 'Now don't whip  these girls so much, they can't work.' Oh, he was a good man. Oh, white  folks was the devil in slavery tines. I was scared to death of 'em.  They'd have these long cow hide whips. Honey, I was treated bad. I seen  a time in this world.    \"Oh Lord, yes, that was long 'fore the war. I was right down on my  master's place when it started. They said it was to free the niggers. Oh  Lord, we was right under it in Davidson County where I come from. Oh  Lord, yes, I knowed all about when the war started. I'se a young woman,  a young woman. We was treated just like dogs and hogs. We seed a hard  time--I know what I'm talkin' about.    \"Oh God, I seed the Yankees. I saw it all. We was so scared we run under  the house and the Yankees called 'Come out Dinah' (didn't call none of  us anything but Dinah). They said 'Dinah, we're fightin' to free you and  get you out from under bondage.' I sure understood that but I didn't  have no better sense than to go back to mistress.    \"Oh Lord, yes, I seed the Ku Klux. They didn't bother me cause I didn't  stay where they could; I was way under the house.    \"Yankees burned up everything Marse John had. I looked up the pike and  seed the Yankees a coming'. They say 'We's a fightin' for you, Dinah!'  Yankees walked in, chile, just walked right in on us. I tell you I've  seed a time. You talkin' 'bout war--you better wish no more war come. I  know when the war started. The Secessors on this side and the Yankees on  that side. Yes, Miss, I seen enough. My brother went and jined the  Secessors and they killed him time he got in the war.    \"No, Missy, I never went to no school. White folks never learned me  nothin'. I believes in tellin' white folks the truth.    \"White folks didn't 'low us to marry so I never married till I come to  Arkansas and that was one year after surrender.    \"First place I landed on was John Clayton's place. Mr. John Clayton was  a Yankee and he was good to us. We worked in the field and stayed there  two years. I been all up and down the river and oh Lord, I had a good  time after I was free. I been treated right since I was free. My color  is good to me and the white folks, too. I ain't goin' to tell only the  truth. Uncle Sam goin' send me 'cross the water if I don't tell the  truth.
