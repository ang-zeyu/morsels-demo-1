It may also  be found to give a tolerably coherent account of the operations  conducted by Sir Redvers Buller for the Relief of Ladysmith. The  correspondence of which it is mainly composed appeared in the columns of  the _Morning Post_ newspaper, and I propose, if I am not interrupted by  the accidents of war, to continue the series of letters. The stir and  tumult of a camp do not favour calm or sustained thought, and whatever  is written herein must be regarded simply as the immediate effect  produced by men powerfully moved, and scenes swiftly changing upon what  I hope is a truth-seeking mind.    The fact that a man's life depends upon my discretion compels me to omit  an essential part of the story of my escape from the Boers; but if the  book and its author survive the war, and when the British flag is firmly  planted at Bloemfontein and Pretoria, I shall hasten to fill the gap in  the narrative.

'Dunottar Castle,' at sea: October 26, 1899.    The last cry of 'Any more for the shore?' had sounded, the last good-bye  had been said, the latest pressman or photographer had scrambled ashore,  and all Southampton was cheering wildly along a mile of pier and  promontory when at 6 P.M., on October 14, the Royal Mail steamer  'Dunottar Castle' left her moorings and sailed with Sir Redvers Buller  for the Cape. For a space the decks remained crowded with the passengers  who, while the sound of many voices echoed in their ears, looked back  towards the shores swiftly fading in the distance and the twilight, and  wondered whether, and if so when, they would come safe home again; then  everyone hurried to his cabin, arranged his luggage, and resigned  himself to the voyage.    What an odious affair is a modern sea journey! In ancient times there  were greater discomforts and perils; but they were recognised. A man  took ship prepared for the worst. Nowadays he expects the best as a  matter of course, and is, therefore, disappointed. Besides, how slowly  we travel! In the sixteenth century nobody minded taking five months to  get anywhere. But a fortnight is a large slice out of the nineteenth  century; and the child of civilisation, long petted by Science,  impatiently complains to his indulgent guardian of all delay in travel,  and petulantly calls on her to complete her task and finally eliminate  the factor of distance from human calculations. A fortnight is a long  time in modern life. It is also a long time in modern war--especially at  the beginning. To be without news for a fortnight at any time is  annoying. To be without news for a fortnight now is a torture. And this  voyage lasts more than a fortnight! At the very outset of our  enterprise we are compelled to practise Mr. Morley's policy of patience.    We left London amid rumours of all kinds. The Metropolis was shrouded in  a fog of credulous uncertainty, broken only by the sinister gleam of the  placarded lie or the croak of the newsman. Terrible disasters  had occurred and had been contradicted; great battles were  raging--unconfirmed; and beneath all this froth the tide of war was  really flowing, and no man could shut his eyes to grave possibilities.  Then the ship sailed, and all was silence--a heaving silence. But  Madeira was scarcely four days' journey. There we should find the  answers to many questions. At Madeira, however, we learned nothing, but  nothing, though satisfactory, is very hard to understand. Why did they  declare war if they had nothing up their sleeves? Why are they wasting  time now? Such were the questions. Then we sailed again, and again  silence shut down, this time, however, on a more even keel.    Speculation arises out of ignorance. Many and various are the  predictions as to what will be the state of the game when we shall have  come to anchor in Table Bay. Forecasts range from the capture of  Pretoria by Sir George White and the confinement of President Kruger in  the deepest level beneath the Johannesburg Exchange, on the one hand, to  the surrender of Cape Town to the Boers, the proclamation of Mr.  Schreiner as King of South Africa, and a fall of two points in Rand  Mines on the other. Between these wild extremes all shades of opinion  are represented. Only one possibility is unanimously excluded--an  inconclusive peace. There are on board officers who travelled this road  eighteen years ago with Lord Roberts, and reached Cape Town only to  return by the next boat. But no one anticipates such a result this time.    Monotony is the characteristic of a modern voyage, and who shall  describe it? The lover of realism might suggest that writing the same  paragraph over and over again would enable the reader to experience its  weariness, if he were truly desirous of so doing. But I hesitate to  take such a course, and trust that some of these lines even once  repeated may convey some inkling of the dulness of the days. Monotony of  view--for we live at the centre of a complete circle of sea and sky;  monotony of food--for all things taste the same on board ship; monotony  of existence--for each day is but a barren repetition of the last; all  fall to the lot of the passenger on great waters. It were malevolent to  try to bring the realisation home to others. Yet all earthly evils have  their compensations, and even monotony is not without its secret joy.  For a time we drop out of the larger world, with its interests and its  obligations, and become the independent citizens of a tiny State:--a  Utopian State where few toil and none go hungry--bounded on all sides by  the sea and vassal only to the winds and waves. Here during a period  which is too long while it lasts, too short when it is over, we may  placidly reflect on the busy world that lies behind and the tumult that  is before us. The journalists read books about South Africa; the  politician--were the affair still in the domain of words--might examine  the justice of the quarrel. The Headquarter Staff pore over maps or  calculate the sizes of camps and entrenchments; and in the meantime the  great ship lurches steadily forward on her course, carrying to the south  at seventeen miles an hour schemes and intentions of war.    But let me record the incidents rather than their absence. One day the  first shoal of flying fish is seen--a flight of glittering birds that,  flushed by the sudden approach of the vessel, skim away over the waters  and turn in the cover of a white-topped wave. On another we crossed the  Equator. Neptune and his consort boarded us near the forecastle and  paraded round the ship in state.

No. 3.                [Illustration:  HENRY BROUGHAM, LORD BROUGHAM AND VAUX.  FROM A SKETCH BY ALFRED CROWQUILL, MADE IN JULY, 1850.]      LORD BROUGHAM.    It is generally understood that this most illustrious Englishman now  living, will, in the course of the present year, visit the United States.  Whatever may be the verdict of the future upon his qualities or his  conduct as a statesman, it is scarcely to be doubted that for the variety  and splendor of his abilities, the extent, diversity and usefulness of  his labors, and that restless, impatient and feverish activity which has  kept him so long and so eminently conspicuous in affairs, he will be  regarded by the next ages as one of the most remarkable personages in the  age now closing--the second golden age of England. Lord Brougham is of a  Cumberland family, but was born in Edinburgh (where his father had  married a niece of the historian Robertson), on the 19th of September,  1779. He was educated at the University of his native city, and we first  hear of him as a member of a celebrated debating society, where he  trained himself to the use of logic. He was not yet sixteen years of age  when he communicated a paper on Light to the Royal Society of London,  which was printed in their transactions; and before he was twenty he had  written discussions of the higher geometry, which, appearing  in the same  repository of the best learning, attracted the general attention of  European scholars. In 1802, with his friends Jeffrey, Francis Homer, and  Sidney Smith, he established the Edinburgh Review. In 1806 he published  his celebrated \"Inquiry into the Colonial Policy of the European Powers,\"  and soon after was called to the English bar, and settled in London,  where he rapidly rose to the highest eminence as a counselor and an  advocate. On the 16th of March, 1808, he appeared in behalf of the  merchants of London, Liverpool, Manchester, &c., before the House of  Commons, in the matter of the Orders in Council restricting trade with  America, and greatly increased his fame by one of the most masterly  arguments he ever delivered. In 1810 he became a member of Parliament,  and he soon distinguished himself here by his speeches on the slave trade  and against the Orders in Council, which, mainly through his means, were  rescinded. Venturing, at the general election of 1812, to contest the  seat for Liverpool with Mr. Canning, he was defeated, and for four years  he devoted himself chiefly to his profession. In this period he made many  of his most famous law arguments, and acquired the enmity of the Prince  Regent by his defense of Leigh Hunt, and his brother, in the case of  their famous libel in \"_The Examiner_.\" In 1816 he commenced those  powerful and indefatigable efforts in behalf of education, by which he is  perhaps best entitled to the gratitude of mankind. As chairman of the  educational committee of forty, he drew up the two voluminous and  masterly reports which disclosed the exact condition of British  civilization, and induced such action on the part of government as  advanced it in ten years more than it had been previously advanced in a  century. In 1820 he displayed in their perfection those amazing powers of  knowledge, reason, invective, sarcasm, and elocution, on the trial of  Queen Caroline, which more than anything else have made  that trial so memorable among legal and forensic conflicts. In 1822 he  made his unparalleled speech in the case of the Dean and Chapter of  Durham against Williams, and in the following year was elected Lord  Rector of the University of Glasgow. On the downfall of the Wellington  administration, in 1830, and the consequent general election, he was  returned to Parliament as one of the members for Yorkshire, and a few  weeks afterward was made Lord High. Chancellor, and elevated to the  peerage under the title of Lord Brougham and Vaux. He continued in the  office of Lord Chancellor until the dissolution of the Melbourne cabinet,  in 1834. In 1823 he wrote his \"Practical Observations on the Education of  the People,\" and was engaged with Dr. Birkbeck in the formation of the  first Mechanics' Institution. In 1827 he was one of the originators of  the London University, and in the same year he founded the Society for  the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, of which he was the first president,  and for which he wrote its first publication, the admirable \"Treatise on  the Objects, Pleasures, and Advantages of Science.\" In 1830 he was  elected a member of the Institute of France, and about the time of his  resignation of the chancellorship he published his \"Discourse on Natural  Theology.\" In 1840 he published his \"Historical Sketches of the Statesmen  who flourished in the Time of George the Third;\" in 1845-6, \"Lives of Men  of Letters and Science who flourished in the Time of George the Third;\"  and he has since given to the world works on \"The French Revolution,\" on  \"Instinct,\" \"Demosthenes' Oration on the Crown,\" &c., &c. Collections  of  his Speeches and Forensic Arguments, and of his Critical Essays, as well  as the other works above referred to, have been republished in  Philadelphia, by Lea and Blanchard.    In the language of the Editor of his \"Opinions\", Lord Brougham is  remarkable for uniting, in a high degree of perfection, three things  which are not often found to be compatible. His learning is all but  universal: his reason is cultivated to the perfection of the  argumentative powers; and he possesses in a rare and eminent degree the  gift of eloquence.    Of his learning it may be said that there is scarcely a subject, on which  ingenuity or intellect has been exercised, that he has not probed to its  principles, or entered into with the spirit of a philosopher. That he is  a classical scholar of a high order, is shown by his criticisms on the  internal peculiarities of the works of the ancients and their styles of  composition. They evince an intimate acquaintance with the great master  pieces of antiquity. The book-worms of Universities--those scholastic  giants who are great on small questions of quantity and etymology,--who  buckle on the ponderous armor of the commentators in the contest with  more subtle wits, on the interesting doubt of a wrong reading; such men,  in the spirit of pedantry, have refused to Lord Brougham the merit of  profundity, while they allow that he possesses a sort of superficial  knowledge of the classics; they say that he can gracefully skim the  surface of the stream, but that its depths would overwhelm him. Now,  while this may be true as regards the fact, we dissent from it as regards  the inference. It is a question to be decided between the learned drones  of a by-gone school and the quicker intellects of a ripening age, which  is the better thing,--criticism on words--on accidental peculiarities of  style--or a just and sympathizing conception of the feelings of the poet  or the wisdom of the philosopher. Men are beginning to disregard the  former, while they set a high value upon the latter: so much  laboriously-earned learning is at a discount, and allowance should be  made for the petty spite, the depreciating superciliousness, of  disappointment. Lord Brougham's classical knowledge partakes more of that  intimate regard and appreciation which we accord to the great writers,  than of this pedantry of the schools. Hence the cry of want of depth,  that has been raised against him. Like many other great men of his age,  he has read the authors of Greece and Rome in a spirit that has  identified him with their thoughts and feelings, by taking into account  the circumstances of their times; and the result has been, that he has  exchanged the formalities and critical sharp-sightedness of acquaintance  for the intimacy of friendship.    In point of general political knowledge, and particularly of that branch  called political  economy, Lord Brougham stands prominently among his  contemporaries. In his speeches and writings will be found the first  principles of every new view of these subjects that has been taken by the  moderns. Of not a few he has himself been the originator. In the party  history of the last century he is well versed, as many of his speeches  show; and no public man of the present day is so well acquainted with the  theory and practice of the constitution, whether as regards the broad  principles of liberty on which it is based, or its gradual formation  during the different periods of our history. It may not be amiss here to  observe, that notwithstanding his long connection with the movement  party, and the countenance he has from time to time given to measures of  a decidedly liberal cast, he never was, and is still as far from being, a  Democrat. Throughout his career he has been a consistent Liberal: always  advocating such measures of reform as were calculated to remove abuses,  while they in no way affected the stability and integrity of the  institutions of the country. While, on the one hand, he has declared his  most unequivocal opposition to the ballot and universal suffrage, on the  other he has advocated popular education, as the ultimate panacea for all  the evils to be feared from the extension of popular influence.    The legal knowledge of Lord Brougham has been questioned by the members  of the profession whose abuses he desired to reform. It was even said,  that while his elevation to the Chancellorship was"]]]
