While we did not  exactly belong to the poor whites, we classed with them in poverty,  being renters; but I am inclined to think my parents were  intellectually superior to that common type of the South. Both were  foreign born, my mother being Scotch and my father a north of Ireland  man,--as I remember him, now, impulsive, hasty in action, and slow to  confess a fault. It was his impulsiveness that led him to volunteer  and serve four years in the Confederate army,--trying years to my  mother, with a brood of seven children to feed, garb, and house. The  war brought me my initiation as a cowboy, of which I have now, after  the long lapse of years, the greater portion of which were spent with  cattle, a distinct recollection. Sherman's army, in its march to the  sea, passed through our county, devastating that section for miles in  its passing.    Foraging parties scoured the country on either side of its path. My  mother had warning in time and set her house in order. Our work stock  consisted of two yoke of oxen, while our cattle numbered three cows,  and for saving them from the foragers credit must be given to my  mother's generalship. There was a wild canebrake, in which the cattle  fed, several hundred acres in extent, about a mile from our little  farm, and it was necessary to bell them in order to locate them when  wanted. But the cows were in the habit of coming up to be milked, and  a soldier can hear a bell as well as any one. I was a lad of eight at  the time, and while my two older brothers worked our few fields, I was  sent into the canebrake to herd the cattle. We had removed the bells  from the oxen and cows, but one ox was belled after darkness each  evening, to be unbelled again at daybreak. I always carried the bell  with me, stuffed with grass, in order to have it at hand when wanted.    During the first few days of the raid, a number of mounted foraging  parties passed our house, but its poverty was all too apparent, and  nothing was molested. Several of these parties were driving herds of  cattle and work stock of every description, while by day and by night  gins and plantation houses were being given to the flames. Our  one-roomed log cabin was spared, due to the ingenious tale told by my  mother as to the whereabouts of my father; and yet she taught her  children to fear God and tell the truth. My vigil was trying to one of  my years, for the days seemed like weeks, but the importance of hiding  our cattle was thoroughly impressed upon my mind. Food was secretly  brought to me, and under cover of darkness, my mother and eldest  brother would come and milk the cows, when we would all return home  together. Then, before daybreak, we would be in the cane listening for  the first tinkle, to find the cattle and remove the bell. And my day's  work commenced anew.    Only once did I come near betraying my trust. About the middle of the  third day I grew very hungry, and as the cattle were lying down, I  crept to the edge of the canebrake to see if my dinner was not  forthcoming. Soldiers were in sight, which explained everything.  Concealed in the rank cane I stood and watched them. Suddenly a squad  of five or six turned a point of the brake and rode within fifty feet  of me. I stood like a stone statue, my concealment being perfect.  After they had passed, I took a step forward, the better to watch them  as they rode away, when the grass dropped out of the bell and it  clattered. A red-whiskered soldier heard the tinkle, and wheeling his  horse, rode back. I grasped the clapper and lay flat on the ground, my  heart beating like a trip-hammer. He rode within twenty feet of me,  peering into the thicket of cane, and not seeing anything unusual,  turned and galloped away after his companions. Then the lesson, taught  me by my mother, of being \"faithful over a few things,\" flashed  through my mind, and though our cattle were spared to us, I felt very  guilty.    Another vivid recollection of those boyhood days in Georgia was the  return of my father from the army. The news of Lee's surrender had  reached us, and all of us watched for his coming. Though he was long  delayed, when at last he did come riding home on a swallow-marked  brown mule, he was a conquering hero to us children. We had never  owned a horse, and he assured us that the animal was his own, and by  turns set us on the tired mule's back. He explained to mother and us  children how, though he was an infantryman, he came into possession of  the animal. Now, however, with my mature years and knowledge of  brands, I regret to state that the mule had not been condemned and was  in the \"U.S.\" brand. A story which Priest, \"The Rebel,\" once told me  throws some light on the matter; he asserted that all good soldiers  would steal. \"Can you take the city of St. Louis?\" was asked of  General Price. \"I don't know as I can take it,\" replied the general to  his consulting superiors, \"but if you will give me Louisiana troops,  I'll agree to steal it.\"    Though my father had lost nothing by the war, he was impatient to go  to a new country. Many of his former comrades were going to Texas,  and, as our worldly possessions were movable, to Texas we started. Our  four oxen were yoked to the wagon, in which our few household effects  were loaded and in which mother and the smaller children rode, and  with the cows, dogs, and elder boys bringing up the rear, our caravan  started, my father riding the mule and driving the oxen. It was an  entire summer's trip, full of incident, privation, and hardship. The  stock fared well, but several times we were compelled to halt and  secure work in order to supply our limited larder. Through certain  sections, however, fish and game were abundant. I remember the  enthusiasm we all felt when we reached the Sabine River, and for the  first time viewed the promised land. It was at a ferry, and the  sluggish river was deep. When my father informed the ferryman that he  had no money with which to pay the ferriage, the latter turned on him  remarking, sarcastically: \"What, no money? My dear sir, it certainly  can't make much difference to a man which side of the river he's on,  when he has no money.\"    Nothing daunted by this rebuff, my father argued the point at some  length, when the ferryman relented so far as to inform him that ten  miles higher up, the river was fordable. We arrived at the ford the  next day. My father rode across and back, testing the stage of the  water and the river's bottom before driving the wagon in. Then taking  one of the older boys behind him on the mule in order to lighten the  wagon, he drove the oxen into the river. Near the middle the water was  deep enough to reach the wagon box, but with shoutings and a free  application of the gad, we hurried through in safety. One of the wheel  oxen, a black steer which we called \"Pop-eye,\" could be ridden, and I  straddled him in fording, laving my sunburned feet in the cool water.  The cows were driven over next, the dogs swimming, and at last, bag  and baggage, we were in Texas.    We reached the Colorado River early in the fall, where we stopped and  picked cotton for several months, making quite a bit of money, and  near Christmas reached our final destination on the San Antonio River,  where we took up land and built a house. That was a happy home; the  country was new and supplied our simple wants; we had milk and honey,  and, though the fig tree was absent, along the river grew endless  quantities of mustang grapes. At that time the San Antonio valley was  principally a cattle country, and as the boys of our family grew old  enough the fascination of a horse and saddle was too strong to be  resisted. My two older brothers went first, but my father and mother  made strenuous efforts to keep me at home, and did so until I was  sixteen. I suppose it is natural for every country boy to be  fascinated with some other occupation than the one to which he is  bred. In my early teens, I always thought I should like either to  drive six horses to a stage or clerk in a store, and if I could have  attained either of those lofty heights, at that age, I would have  asked no more. So my father, rather than see me follow in the  footsteps of my older brothers, secured me a situation in a village  store some twenty miles distant. The storekeeper was a fellow  countryman of my father--from the same county in Ireland, in fact--and  I was duly elated on getting away from home to the life of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#1)"],[1,"Talks about Jesus    by    S.

A Bit Ahead        So far as I can find out, I have no theory about Jesus to make these talks  fit into. I have tried to find out for myself what the old Book of God  tells about Him. And here I am trying to tell to others, as simply as I  can, what I found. It was by the tedious, twisting path of doubt that I  climbed the hill of truth up to some of its summits of certainty. I am  free to confess that I am ignorant of the subject treated here save for  the statements of that Book, and for the assent within my own spirit to  these statements, which has greatly deepened the impression they made, and  make. There is no question raised here about that Book itself, but simply  a taking and grouping up together of what it says.    Most persons simply _read_ a book. A few _study_ it, also. It is good to  read. It is yet better to go back over it and _study_, and meditate. Since  learning that the two books on power and prayer have been used in Bible  classes I have regretted not including study notes in them. For those who  may want to study about Jesus there has been added at the close a simple  analysis with references. The reading pages have been kept free of  foot-notes to make the reading smooth and easier. The analysis is so  arranged that one can quickly turn in reading to the corresponding  paragraph or page in the study notes.    A great musician strikes the key-note of a great piece of music, and can  skilfully keep it ever sounding its melody through all the changes clear  to the end. It has been in my heart to wish that I could do something like  that here. If what has come to me has gotten out of me into these pages,  there will be found a dominant note of sweetest music--the winsomeness of  God in Jesus.    It is in my heart, too, to add this, that I have a friend whose constant  presence and prayer have been the atmosphere of this little book in its  making.          I. The Purpose of Jesus          1.

The Purpose in Jesus' Coming        <u>God Spelling Himself out in Jesus.</u>      Jesus is God spelling Himself out in language that man can understand. God  and man used to talk together freely. But one day man went away from God.  And then he went farther away. He left home. He left his native land,  Eden, where he lived with God. He emigrated from God. And through going  away he lost his mother-tongue.    A language always changes away from its native land. Through going away  from his native land man lost his native speech. Through not _hearing_ God  speak he forgot the sounds of the words. His ears grew dull and then deaf.  Through lack of use he lost the power of _speaking_ the old words. His  tongue grew thick. It lost its cunning. And so gradually almost all the  old meanings were lost.    God has always been eager to get to talking with man again. The silence is  hard on Him. He is hungry to be on intimate terms again with his old  friend. Of course he had to use a language that man could understand.  Jesus is God spelling Himself out so man can understand. He is the A and  the Z, and all between, of the Old Eden language of love.    Naturally enough man had a good bit of bother in spelling Jesus out. This  Jesus was something quite new. When His life spoke the simple language of  Eden again, the human heart with selfishness ingrained said, \"That sounds  good, but of course He has some selfish scheme behind it all. This purity  and simplicity and gentleness can't be genuine.\" Nobody yet seems to have  spelled Him out fully, though they're all trying: All on the spelling  bench. That is, all that have heard. Great numbers haven't heard about Him  yet. But many, ah! _many_ could get enough, yes, _can_ get enough to bring  His purity into their lives and sweet peace into their hearts.    But there were in His days upon earth some sticklers for the old spelling  forms. Not the oldest, mind you. Jesus alone stands for that. This Jesus  didn't observe the idioms that had grown up outside of Eden. These people  had decided that these old forms were the only ones acceptable. And so  they disliked Him from the beginning, and quarrelled with Him. These  idioms were dearer to them than life--that is, than _His_ life. So having  quarrelled, they did _worse_, and then--softly--_worst_. But even in their  worst, Jesus was God spelling Himself out in the old simple language of  Eden. His best came out in their worst.    Some of the great nouns of the Eden tongue--the _God_ tongue--He spelled  out big. He spelled out _purity_, the natural life of Eden; and  _obedience_, the rhythmic harmony of Eden; and _peace_, the sweet music of  Eden; and _power_, the mastery and dominion of Eden; and _love_, the  throbbing heart of Eden. It was in biggest, brightest letters that _love_  was spelled out. He used the biggest capitals ever known, and traced each  in a deep dripping red, with a new spelling--s-a-c-r-i-f-i-c-e.        <u>Jesus is God, following us up.</u>      You see, the heart of God had been breaking--_is_ breaking over the ways  things have been going down on this planet. Folk fail to understand Him.  Worse yet, they misunderstand Him, and feel free to criticize Him. Nobody  has been so much slandered as God. Many are utterly ignorant of Him. Many  others who are not ignorant yet ignore Him. They turn their faces and  backs. Some give Him the cut direct. The great crowd in every part of the  world is yearning after Him: piteously, pathetically, most often  speechlessly yearning, blindly groping along, with an intense inner tug  after Him. They know the yearning. They feel the inner, upward tug. They  don't understand what it is for which they yearn, nor what will satisfy.    For man was made to live in closest touch with God. That is his native  air. Out of that air his lungs are badly affected. This other air is too  heavy. It's malarial, and full of gases and germy dust. In it he chokes  and gasps. Yet he knows not why. He gropes about in the night made by his  own shut eyes. He doesn't seem to know enough to open them. And sometimes  he _will_ not open them. For the hinge of the eyelid is in the will. And  having shut the light out, he gets tangled up in his ideas as to what _is_  light. He puts darkness for light, and light for darkness.    Once man knew God well; close up. And that means _loved_, gladly, freely.  For here to know is to love. But one day a bad choice was made. And the  choice made an ugly kink in his will. The whole trouble began there. A man  sees through his will. That is his medium for the transmission of light.  If it be twisted, his seeing, his understanding, is twisted. The twist in  the will regulates the twist in the eye. Both ways, too, for a good change  in the will in turn changes the eyes back to seeing straight. He that is  willing to do the right shall clearly see the light.    But that first kink seems to have been getting worse kinked ever since.  And so man does not see God as He is. Man is cross-eyed Godward, but  doesn't know it. Man is color-blind toward God. The blue of God's truth is  to him an arousing, angering red. The soft, soothing green of His love  becomes a noisy, irritating yellow. Nobody has been so much misunderstood  as God. He has suffered misrepresentation from two quarters: His enemies  and His friends. More from--which? Hard to tell. Jesus is God trying to  tell men plainly what He is really like.    The world turned down the wrong lane, and has been going that way  pell-mell ever since. Yet so close is the wrong lane to the right that a  single step will change lanes. Though many results of being in the wrong  lane will not be changed by the change of lanes. It takes time to rest up  the feet made sore by the roughness of the wrong lane. And some of the  scars, where men have measured their length, seem to stay.    The result of that wrong turning has been pitiable. _Separation from God_,  so far as _man_ could make separation. There is no separation on God's  part. He has never changed. He remains in the world, but because of man's  turning his face away, He remains as a stranger, unrecognized. He remains  just where man left Him. And any one going back to that point in the road  will find Him standing waiting with an eager light glistening in His eyes.  _No_! That's not accurate. He is _a bit nearer_ than ever He was. He is  following us up. He is only a step off. Jesus is God eagerly following us  up.        <u>The Early Eden Picture.</u>      But one will"]]]
