WELLS                [Illustration: He stopped, and then made a dash to escape from their  closing ranks.]              INTRODUCTION    The enterprise of Messrs. T. Nelson & Sons and the friendly accommodation  of Messrs. Macmillan render possible this collection in one cover of all  the short stories by me that I care for any one to read again. Except for  the two series of linked incidents that make up the bulk of the book  called _Tales of Space and Time_, no short story of mine of the  slightest merit is excluded from this volume. Many of very questionable  merit find a place; it is an inclusive and not an exclusive gathering.  And the task of selection and revision brings home to me with something of  the effect of discovery that I was once an industrious writer of short  stories, and that I am no longer anything of the kind. I have not written  one now for quite a long time, and in the past five or six years I have  made scarcely one a year. The bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from which  this present three-and-thirty have been chosen dates from the last  century. This edition is more definitive than I supposed when first I  arranged for it. In the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an  almost obituary manner seems justifiable.    I find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have  restricted the flow of these inventions. It has happened, I remark, to  others as well as to myself, and in spite of the kindliest encouragement  to continue from editors and readers. There was a time when life bubbled  with short stories; they were always coming to the surface of my mind, and  it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production.  It is rather, I think, a diversion of attention to more sustained and more  exacting forms. It was my friend Mr. C.L. Hind who set that spring going.  He urged me to write short stories for the _Pall Mall Budget_, and  persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that I could do what he  desired. There existed at the time only the little sketch, \"The Jilting of  Jane,\" included in this volume--at least, that is the only tolerable  fragment of fiction I find surviving from my pre-Lewis-Hind period. But I  set myself, so encouraged, to the experiment of inventing moving and  interesting things that could be given vividly in the little space of  eight or ten such pages as this, and for a time I found it a very  entertaining pursuit indeed. Mr. Hind's indicating finger had shown me an  amusing possibility of the mind. I found that, taking almost anything as a  starting-point and letting my thoughts play about it, there would  presently come out of the darkness, in a manner quite inexplicable, some  absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial  nucleus. Little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out  of nothingness, incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares;  violent conflicts would break out amidst the flower-beds of suburban  gardens; I would discover I was peering into remote and mysterious worlds  ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity.    The 'nineties was a good and stimulating period for a short-story writer.  Mr. Kipling had made his astonishing advent with a series of little  blue-grey books, whose covers opened like window-shutters to reveal  the dusty sun-glare and blazing colours of the East; Mr. Barrie had  demonstrated what could be done in a little space through the panes of his  _Window in Thrums_. The _National Observer_ was at the climax of  its career of heroic insistence upon lyrical brevity and a vivid finish,  and Mr. Frank Harris was not only printing good short stories by other  people, but writing still better ones himself in the dignified pages of  the _Fortnightly Review. Longman's Magazine_, too, represented a  _clientele_ of appreciative short-story readers that is now  scattered. Then came the generous opportunities of the _Yellow Book_,  and the _National Observer_ died only to give birth to the _New  Review_. No short story of the slightest distinction went for long  unrecognised. The sixpenny popular magazines had still to deaden down the  conception of what a short story might be to the imaginative limitation of  the common reader--and a maximum length of six thousand words. Short  stories broke out everywhere. Kipling was writing short stories; Barrie,  Stevenson, Frank-Harris; Max Beerbohm wrote at least one perfect one, \"The  Happy Hypocrite\"; Henry James pursued his wonderful and inimitable bent;  and among other names that occur to me, like a mixed handful of jewels  drawn from a bag, are George Street, Morley Roberts, George Gissing, Ella  d'Arcy, Murray Gilchrist, E. Nesbit, Stephen Crane, Joseph Conrad, Edwin  Pugh, Jerome K. Jerome, Kenneth Graham, Arthur Morrison, Marriott Watson,  George Moore, Grant Allen, George Egerton, Henry Harland, Pett Ridge, W.  W. Jacobs (who alone seems inexhaustible). I dare say I could recall as  many more names with a little effort. I may be succumbing to the  infirmities of middle age, but I do not think the present decade can  produce any parallel to this list, or what is more remarkable, that the  later achievements in this field of any of the survivors from that time,  with the sole exception of Joseph Conrad, can compare with the work they  did before 1900. It seems to me this outburst of short stories came not  only as a phase in literary development, but also as a phase in the  development of the individual writers concerned.    It is now quite unusual to see any adequate criticism of short stories in  English. I do not know how far the decline in short-story writing may not  be due to that. Every sort of artist demands human responses, and few men  can contrive to write merely for a publisher's cheque and silence, however  reassuring that cheque may be. A mad millionaire who commissioned  masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them. Scarcely any  artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention; and it was  primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of  the 'nineties were written. People talked about them tremendously,  compared them, and ranked them. That was the thing that mattered.    It was not, of course, all good talk, and we suffered then, as now, from  the _a priori_ critic. Just as nowadays he goes about declaring that  the work of such-and-such a dramatist is all very amusing and delightful,  but \"it isn't a Play,\" so we' had a great deal of talk about _the_  short story, and found ourselves measured by all kinds of arbitrary  standards. There was a tendency to treat the short story as though it was  as definable a form as the sonnet, instead of being just exactly what any  one of courage and imagination can get told in twenty minutes' reading or  so. It was either Mr. Edward Garnett or Mr. George Moore in a violently  anti-Kipling mood who invented the distinction between the short story and  the anecdote. The short story was Maupassant; the anecdote was damnable.  It was a quite infernal comment in its way, because it permitted no  defence. Fools caught it up and used it freely. Nothing is so destructive  in a field of artistic effort as a stock term of abuse. Anyone could say  of any short story, \"A mere anecdote,\" just as anyone can say  \"Incoherent!\" of any novel or of any sonata that isn't studiously  monotonous. The recession of enthusiasm for this compact, amusing form is  closely associated in my mind with that discouraging imputation. One felt  hopelessly open to a paralysing and unanswerable charge, and one's ease  and happiness in the garden of one's fancies was more and more marred by  the dread of it. It crept into one's mind, a distress as vague and  inexpugnable as a sea fog on a spring morning, and presently one shivered  and wanted to go indoors...It is the absurd fate of the imaginative writer  that he should be thus sensitive to atmospheric conditions.    But after one has died as a maker one may still live as a critic, and I  will confess I am all for laxness and variety in this as in every field of  art. Insistence upon rigid forms and austere unities seems to me the  instinctive reaction of the sterile against the fecund. It is the tired  man with a headache who values a work of art for what it does not contain.  I suppose it is the lot of every critic nowadays to suffer from  indigestion and a fatigued appreciation, and to develop a self-protective  tendency towards rules that will reject, as it were, automatically the  more abundant and irregular forms. But this world is not for the weary,  and in the long-run it is the new and variant that matter. I refuse  altogether to recognise any hard and fast type for the Short Story, any  more than I admit any limitation upon the liberties of the Small Picture.  The short story is a fiction that may be read in something under an hour,  and so that it is moving and delightful, it does not matter whether it is  as \"trivial\" as a Japanese print of insects seen closely between grass  stems, or as spacious as the prospect of the plain of Italy from Monte  Mottarone. It does not matter whether it is human or inhuman, or whether  it leaves you thinking deeply or radiantly but superficially pleased. Some  things are more easily done as short stories than others and more  abundantly done, but one of the many pleasures of short-story writing is  to achieve the impossible.    At any rate, that is the present writer's conception of the art of the  short story, as the jolly art of making something very bright and moving;  it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or beautiful or profoundly  illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen  to fifty minutes to read aloud. All the rest is just whatever invention  and imagination and the mood can give-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#1)"],[1,"form the 1911 W.

CHAPTER I--ADAM SALTON ARRIVES      Adam Salton sauntered into the Empire Club, Sydney, and found awaiting  him a letter from his grand-uncle.  He had first heard from the old  gentleman less than a year before, when Richard Salton had claimed  kinship, stating that he had been unable to write earlier, as he had  found it very difficult to trace his grand-nephew's address.  Adam was  delighted and replied cordially; he had often heard his father speak of  the older branch of the family with whom his people had long lost touch.  Some interesting correspondence had ensued.  Adam eagerly opened the  letter which had only just arrived, and conveyed a cordial invitation to  stop with his grand-uncle at Lesser Hill, for as long a time as he could  spare.    \"Indeed,\" Richard Salton went on, \"I am in hopes that you will make your  permanent home here.  You see, my dear boy, you and I are all that remain  of our race, and it is but fitting that you should succeed me when the  time comes.  In this year of grace, 1860, I am close on eighty years of  age, and though we have been a long-lived race, the span of life cannot  be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds.  I am prepared to like you, and to  make your home with me as happy as you could wish.  So do come at once on  receipt of this, and find the welcome I am waiting to give you.  I send,  in case such may make matters easy for you, a banker's draft for 200  pounds.  Come soon, so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days  together.  If you are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you, send me  as soon as you can a letter telling me when to expect you.  Then when you  arrive at Plymouth or Southampton or whatever port you are bound for,  wait on board, and I will meet you at the earliest hour possible.\"    * * * * *    Old Mr. Salton was delighted when Adam's reply arrived and sent a groom  hot-foot to his crony, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, to inform him that his  grand-nephew was due at Southampton on the twelfth of June.    Mr. Salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the  important day, to start for Stafford, where he would catch the 11.40 a.m.  train.  He would stay that night with his grand-nephew, either on the  ship, which would be a new experience for him, or, if his guest should  prefer it, at a hotel.  In either case they would start in the early  morning for home.  He had given instructions to his bailiff to send the  postillion carriage on to Southampton, to be ready for their journey  home, and to arrange for relays of his own horses to be sent on at once.  He intended that his grand-nephew, who had been all his life in  Australia, should see something of rural England on the drive.  He had  plenty of young horses of his own breeding and breaking, and could depend  on a journey memorable to the young man.  The luggage would be sent on by  rail to Stafford, where one of his carts would meet it.  Mr. Salton,  during the journey to Southampton, often wondered if his grand-nephew was  as much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for  the first time; and it was with an effort that he controlled himself.  The  endless railway lines and switches round the Southampton Docks fired his  anxiety afresh.    As the train drew up on the dockside, he was getting his hand traps  together, when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man jumped  in.    \"How are you, uncle?  I recognised you from the photo you sent me!  I  wanted to meet you as soon as I could, but everything is so strange to me  that I didn't quite know what to do.  However, here I am.  I am glad to  see you, sir.  I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of  miles; now I find that the reality beats all the dreaming!\"  As he spoke  the old man and the young one were heartily wringing each other's hands.    The meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well.  Adam, seeing that the  old man was interested in the novelty of the ship, suggested that he  should stay the night on board, and that he would himself be ready to  start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested.  This  affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite won the old  man's heart.  He warmly accepted the invitation, and at once they became  not only on terms of affectionate relationship, but almost like old  friends.  The heart of the old man, which had been empty for so long,  found a new delight.  The young man found, on landing in the old country,  a welcome and a surrounding in full harmony with all his dreams  throughout his wanderings and solitude, and the promise of a fresh and  adventurous life.  It was not long before the old man accepted him to  full relationship by calling him by his Christian name.  After a long  talk on affairs of interest, they retired to the cabin, which the elder  was to share.  Richard Salton put his hands affectionately on the boy's  shoulders--though Adam was in his twenty-seventh year, he was a boy, and  always would be, to his grand-uncle.    \"I am so glad to find you as you are, my dear boy--just such a young man  as I had always hoped for as a son, in the days when I still had such  hopes.  However, that is all past.  But thank God there is a new life to  begin for both of us.  To you must be the larger part--but there is still  time for some of it to be shared in common.  I have waited till we should  have seen each other to enter upon the subject; for I thought it better  not to tie up your young life to my old one till we should have  sufficient personal knowledge to justify such a venture.  Now I can, so  far as I am concerned, enter into it freely, since from the moment my  eyes rested on you I saw my son--as he shall be, God willing--if he  chooses such a course himself.\"    \"Indeed I do, sir--with all my heart!\"    \"Thank you, Adam, for that.\"  The old, man's eyes filled and his voice  trembled.  Then, after a long silence between them, he went on: \"When I  heard you were coming I made my will.  It was well that your interests  should be protected from that moment on.  Here is the deed--keep it,  Adam.  All I have shall belong to you; and if love and good wishes, or  the memory of them, can make life sweeter, yours shall be a happy one.  Now, my dear boy, let us turn in.  We start early in the morning and have  a long drive before us.  I hope you don't mind driving?  I was going to  have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather, your  great-grand-uncle, went to Court when William IV. was king.  It is all  right--they built well in those days--and it has been kept in perfect  order.  But I think I have done better: I have sent the carriage in which  I travel myself.  The horses are of my own breeding, and relays of them  shall take us all the way.  I hope you like horses?  They have long been  one of my greatest interests in life.\"    \"I love them, sir, and I am happy to say I have many of my own.  My  father gave me a horse farm for myself when I was eighteen.  I devoted  myself to it, and it has gone on.  Before I came away, my steward gave me  a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand, nearly  all good.\"    \"I am glad, my boy.  Another link between us.\"    \"Just fancy what a delight it will be, sir, to see so much of England--and  with you!\"    \"Thank you again, my boy.  I will tell you all about your future home and  its surroundings as we go.  We shall travel in old-fashioned state, I  tell you.  My grandfather always drove four-in-hand; and so shall we.\"    \"Oh, thanks, sir, thanks.  May I take the ribbons sometimes?\"    \"Whenever you choose, Adam.  The team is your own.  Every horse we use to-  day is to be your own.\"    \"You are too generous, uncle!\"    \"Not at all.  Only an old man's selfish pleasure.  It is not every day  that an heir to the old home comes back.  And--oh, by the way . . . No,  we had better turn in now--I shall tell you the rest in the morning.\"          CHAPTER II--THE CASWALLS OF CASTRA REGIS      Mr. Salton had all his life been an early riser, and necessarily an early  waker.  But early as he woke on the next morning--and although there was  an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of  the \"donkey\" engine winches of the great ship--he met the eyes of Adam  fixed on him from his berth.  His grand-nephew had given him the sofa,  occupying the lower berth himself.  The old man, despite his great  strength and normal activity, was somewhat tired by his long journey of  the day before, and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed  it.  So he was glad to lie still and rest his body, whilst his mind was  actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings.  Adam, too, after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred, woke with  the dawn, and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day  whenever it might suit his elder companion.  It was little wonder, then,  that, so soon as each realised the other's readiness, they simultaneously  jumped up and began to dress.  The steward had by previous instructions  early breakfast prepared, and it was not long before they went down the  gangway on shore in search of the carriage.    They found Mr. Salton's bailiff looking out for them on the dock, and he  brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street.  Richard Salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the  suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel.  To it were  harnessed four useful horses, with a postillion to each pair.    \"See,\" said the old man proudly, \"how it has all the luxuries of useful  travel--silence and isolation as well as speed.  There is nothing to  obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they  may say.  I have"]]]
