In preparing this sketch it is needless to say how deeply I am indebted  to Mr. Spedding and Mr. Ellis, the last editors of Bacon's writings, the  very able and painstaking commentators, the one on Bacon's life, the  other on his philosophy. It is impossible to overstate the affectionate  care and high intelligence and honesty with which Mr. Spedding has  brought together and arranged the materials for an estimate of Bacon's  character. In the result, in spite of the force and ingenuity of much of  his pleading, I find myself most reluctantly obliged to differ from him;  it seems to me to be a case where the French saying, cited by Bacon in  one of his commonplace books, holds good--\"_Par trop se debattre, la  verite se perd_.\"[1] But this does not diminish the debt of gratitude  which all who are interested about Bacon must owe to Mr. Spedding. I  wish also to acknowledge the assistance which I have received from Mr.  Gardiner's _History of England_ and Mr. Fowler's edition of the _Novum  Organum_; and not least from M. de Remusat's work on Bacon, which seems  to me the most complete and the most just estimate both of Bacon's  character and work which has yet appeared; though even in this clear  and dispassionate survey we are reminded by some misconceptions, strange  in M. de Remusat, how what one nation takes for granted is  incomprehensible to its neighbour; and what a gap there is still, even  in matters of philosophy and literature, between the whole Continent and  ourselves--         \"Penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [1] _Promus_: edited by Mrs. H.

The life of Francis Bacon is one which it is a pain to write or to read.  It is the life of a man endowed with as rare a combination of noble  gifts as ever was bestowed on a human intellect; the life of one with  whom the whole purpose of living and of every day's work was to do great  things to enlighten and elevate his race, to enrich it with new powers,  to lay up in store for all ages to come a source of blessings which  should never fail or dry up; it was the life of a man who had high  thoughts of the ends and methods of law and government, and with whom  the general and public good was regarded as the standard by which the  use of public power was to be measured; the life of a man who had  struggled hard and successfully for the material prosperity and opulence  which makes work easy and gives a man room and force for carrying out  his purposes. All his life long his first and never-sleeping passion was  the romantic and splendid ambition after knowledge, for the conquest of  nature and for the service of man; gathering up in himself the spirit  and longings and efforts of all discoverers and inventors of the arts,  as they are symbolised in the mythical Prometheus. He rose to the  highest place and honour; and yet that place and honour were but the  fringe and adornment of all that made him great. It is difficult to  imagine a grander and more magnificent career; and his name ranks among  the few chosen examples of human achievement. And yet it was not only an  unhappy life; it was a poor life. We expect that such an overwhelming  weight of glory should be borne up by a character corresponding to it in  strength and nobleness. But that is not what we find. No one ever had a  greater idea of what he was made for, or was fired with a greater desire  to devote himself to it. He was all this. And yet being all this, seeing  deep into man's worth, his capacities, his greatness, his weakness, his  sins, he was not true to what he knew. He cringed to such a man as  Buckingham. He sold himself to the corrupt and ignominious Government of  James I. He was willing to be employed to hunt to death a friend like  Essex, guilty, deeply guilty, to the State, but to Bacon the most loving  and generous of benefactors. With his eyes open he gave himself up  without resistance to a system unworthy of him; he would not see what  was evil in it, and chose to call its evil good; and he was its first  and most signal victim.    Bacon has been judged with merciless severity. But he has also been  defended by an advocate whose name alone is almost a guarantee for the  justness of the cause which he takes up, and the innocency of the client  for whom he argues. Mr. Spedding devoted nearly a lifetime, and all the  resources of a fine intellect and an earnest conviction, to make us  revere as well as admire Bacon. But it is vain. It is vain to fight  against the facts of his life: his words, his letters. \"Men are made  up,\" says a keen observer, \"of professions, gifts, and talents; and  also of _themselves_.\"[2] With all his greatness, his splendid genius,  his magnificent ideas, his enthusiasm for truth, his passion to be the  benefactor of his kind; with all the charm that made him loved by good  and worthy friends, amiable, courteous, patient, delightful as a  companion, ready to take any trouble--there was in Bacon's \"self\" a deep  and fatal flaw. He was a pleaser of men. There was in him that subtle  fault, noted and named both by philosophy and religion in the [Greek:  areskos] of Aristotle, the [Greek: anthropareskos] of St. Paul, which is  more common than it is pleasant to think, even in good people, but which  if it becomes dominant in a character is ruinous to truth and power. He  was one of the men--there are many of them--who are unable to release  their imagination from the impression of present and immediate power,  face to face with themselves. It seems as if he carried into conduct the  leading rule of his philosophy of nature, _parendo vincitur_. In both  worlds, moral and physical, he felt himself encompassed by vast forces,  irresistible by direct opposition. Men whom he wanted to bring round to  his purposes were as strange, as refractory, as obstinate, as  impenetrable as the phenomena of the natural world. It was no use  attacking in front, and by a direct trial of strength, people like  Elizabeth or Cecil or James; he might as well think of forcing some  natural power in defiance of natural law. The first word of his teaching  about nature is that she must be won by observation of her tendencies  and demands; the same radical disposition of temper reveals itself in  his dealings with men: they, too, must be won by yielding to them, by  adapting himself to their moods and ends; by spying into the drift of  their humour, by subtly and pliantly falling in with it, by circuitous  and indirect processes, the fruit of vigilance and patient thought. He  thought to direct, while submitting apparently to be directed. But he  mistook his strength. Nature and man are different powers, and under  different laws. He chose to please man, and not to follow what his soul  must have told him was the better way. He wanted, in his dealings with  men, that sincerity on which he insisted so strongly in his dealings  with nature and knowledge. And the ruin of a great life was the  consequence.    Francis Bacon was born in London on the 22d of January, 1560/61, three  years before Galileo. He was born at York House, in the Strand; the  house which, though it belonged to the Archbishops of York, had been  lately tenanted by Lord Keepers and Lord Chancellors, in which Bacon  himself afterwards lived as Lord Chancellor, and which passed after his  fall into the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, who has left his mark in  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#1)"],[1,"Team.

His ancestors on  the paternal side, who were Scotch-Irish, came from Scotland and located  in Pennsylvania. His great-grandfather, David McKinley, after serving in  the Revolution, resided in Pennsylvania until 1814, when he went to  Ohio, where he died in 1840, at the age of 85. The grandmother of the  President, Mary Rose, came from a Puritan family that fled from England  to Holland and emigrated to Pennsylvania with William Penn. The father  of the President, William McKinley, sr., was born in Pine Township,  Mercer County, Pa., in 1807, and married Nancy Campbell Allison, of  Columbiana County, Ohio, in 1829. Both the grandfather and father of the  President were iron manufacturers. His father was a devout Methodist,  a stanch Whig and Republican, and an ardent advocate of a protective  tariff. He died during his son's first term as governor of Ohio, in  November, 1892, at the age of 85. The mother of the President passed  away at Canton, Ohio, in December, 1897, at the advanced age of 89.  William McKinley was educated in the public schools of Niles, Union  Seminary, at Poland, Ohio, and Allegheny College, at Meadville, Pa.  Before attaining his majority taught in the public schools. At the  age of 16 became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At the  beginning of hostilities in the War between the States Mr. McKinley,  who was a clerk in the Poland post-office, volunteered his services,  and on June 11, 1861, was enlisted as a private in the Twenty-third Ohio  Volunteer Infantry. Participated in all the early engagements in West  Virginia, and in the winter's camp at Fayetteville received his first  promotion, commissary-sergeant, on April 15, 1862. In recognition of his  services at Antietam, Sergeant McKinley was made second lieutenant, his  commission dating from September 24, 1862, and on February 7, 1863,  while at Camp Piatt, he was again promoted, receiving the rank of first  lieutenant. In the retreat near Lynchburg, Va., his regiment marched 180  miles, fighting nearly all the time, with scarcely any rest or food.  Lieutenant McKinley conducted himself with gallantry, and at Winchester  won additional honors. The Thirteenth West Virginia Regiment failed to  retire when the rest of Hayes's brigade fell back, and, being in great  danger of capture, the young lieutenant was directed to go and bring  it away, which he did in safety, after riding through a heavy fire.  On July 25, 1864, at the age of 21, McKinley was promoted to the rank of  captain. The brigade continued its fighting up and down the Shenandoah  Valley. At Berryville, Va., September 3, 1864, Captain McKinley's horse  was shot from under him. Served successively on the staffs of Generals  R.B. Hayes, George Crook, and Winfield S. Hancock, and on March 14,  1865, was brevetted major of United States Volunteers by President  Lincoln for gallantry in the battles of Opequan, Cedar Creek, and  Fishers Hill. Was detailed as acting assistant adjutant-general of the  First Division, First Army Corps, on the staff of General Samuel S.  Carroll. At the close of the war was urged to remain in the Army, but,  deferring to the judgment of his father, was mustered out of the service  July 26, 1865, and returned to Poland. At once began the study of law  under Glidden & Wilson, of Youngstown, Ohio, and later attended the  law school in Albany, N.Y. Was admitted to the bar in March, 1867, at  Warren, Ohio, and the same year removed to Canton, Ohio, which has since  been his home. In 1867 his first political speeches were made in favor  of negro suffrage. In 1869 was elected prosecuting attorney of Stark  County, and served one term, being defeated two years later for the same  office. Mr. McKinley took an active interest in State politics, and made  speeches in many of the campaigns. On January 25, 1871, married Miss  Ida Saxton. Two daughters were born to them, both of whom died in  early childhood. In 1876 was elected a member of the National House of  Representatives, and for fourteen years represented the Congressional  district of which his county was a part, except for a portion of his  fourth term, when he was unseated late in the first session. While in  Congress served on the Committees on the Judiciary, Revision of the  Laws, Expenditures in the Post-Office Department, Rules, and Ways and  Means. As chairman of the last-named committee in the Fifty-first  Congress, reported the tariff law of 1890. At the beginning of this  Congress was defeated in the caucus of his party for the Speakership of  the House. In the meantime, his district having been materially changed,  he was defeated for reelection to Congress in November, 1890, though he  largely reduced the usual majority against his party in the counties of  which the new district was constituted. In 1891 was elected governor of  Ohio by a plurality of 21,500, and in 1893 was reelected by a plurality  of 80,995. In 1884 was a delegate at large to the Republican national  convention, and supported James G. Blaine for President; was a member  of the committee on resolutions, and presented the platform to the  convention. Also attended the convention of his party in 1888 as a  delegate at large from Ohio, supporting John Sherman for President,  and as chairman of the committee on resolutions again reported the  platform. In 1892 was again a delegate at large from Ohio, and  supported the renomination of Benjamin Harrison, and served as chairman  of the convention. At that convention 182 votes were cast for him  for President, although he had persistently refused to have his name  considered. On June 18, 1896, was nominated for President by the  national convention of his party at St. Louis, receiving on the first  ballot 661-1/2 out of a total of 922 votes. Was chosen President at the  ensuing November election by a plurality in the popular vote of over  600,000, and received 271 electoral votes, against 176 for William J.  Bryan, of Nebraska.          SPECIAL MESSAGE.    EXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 17, 1897_.    _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_    Official information from our consuls in Cuba establishes the fact that  a large number of American citizens in the island are in a state of  destitution, suffering for want of food and medicines. This applies  particularly to the rural districts of the central and eastern parts.    The agricultural classes have been forced from their farms into  the nearest towns, where they are without work or money. The local  authorities of the several towns, however kindly disposed, are unable to  relieve the needs of their own people and are altogether powerless to  help our citizens.    The latest report of Consul-General Lee estimates six to eight hundred  Americans are without means of support. I have assured him that  provision would be made at once to relieve them. To that end I recommend  that Congress make an appropriation of not less than $50,000, to be  immediately available, for use under the direction of the Secretary of  State.    It is desirable that a part of the sum which may be appropriated by  Congress should, in the discretion of the Secretary of State, also be  used for the transportation of American citizens who, desiring to return  to the United States, are without means to do so.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.          FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.    EXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 6, 1897_.           *       *       *       *       *    The most important problem with which this Government is now called upon  to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward  Spain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less  in common with those now existing have confronted this Government at  various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one  of unrest, growing discontent, an effort toward a larger enjoyment of  liberty and self-control, of organized resistance to the mother country,  of depression after distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlement  to be followed by renewed revolt. For no enduring period since the  enfranchisement of the continental possessions of Spain in the Western  Continent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba  not caused concern to the United States.    The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon  the island and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home  Government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power  called forth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declarations of  the policy of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's  connection with Spain unless in the direction of independence or  acquisition by us through purchase, nor has there been any change of  this declared policy since upon the part of the Government.    The revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite the  strenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress  it. Then as now the Government of the United States testified its grave  concern and offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The  overtures made by General Grant were refused and the war dragged on,  entailing great loss of life and treasure and increased injury to  American interests, besides throwing enhanced burdens of neutrality upon  this Government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon,"]]]
