It is, perhaps, more difficult to write accurate history than anything  else, and this is true not only of nations, kings, politicians, or wars,  but of events and things witnessed or called into existence in every-day  life. In _The Engineer_ for September 17, 1880, we did our best to place a  true statement of the facts concerning the Rocket before our readers. In  many respects this was the most remarkable steam engine ever built, and  about it there ought to be no difficulty, one would imagine, in arriving at  the truth. It was for a considerable period the cynosure of all eyes.  Engineers all over the world were interested in its performance. Drawings  were made of it; accounts were written of it, descriptions of it abounded.  Little more than half a century has elapsed since it startled the world by  its performance at Rainhill, and yet it is not too much to say that the  truth--the whole truth, that is to say--can never now be written. We are,  however, able to put some facts before our readers now which have never  before been published, which are sufficiently startling, and while  supplying a missing link in the history of the locomotive, go far to show  that much that has hitherto been held to be true is not true at all.    When the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened on the 15th of  September, 1830, among those present was James Nasmyth, subsequently the  inventor of the steam hammer. Mr. Nasmyth was a good freehand draughtsman,  and he sketched the Rocket as it stood on the line. The sketch is still in  existence. Mr. Nasmyth has placed this sketch at our disposal, thus earning  the gratitude of our readers, and we have reproduced as nearly as possible,  but to a somewhat enlarged scale, this invaluable link in the history of  the locomotive. Mr. Nasmyth writes concerning it, July 26, 1884: \"This  slight and hasty sketch of the Rocket was made the day before the opening  of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, September 12, 1830. I availed  myself of the opportunity of a short pause in the experimental runs with  the Rocket, of three or four miles between Liverpool and Rainhill, George  Stephenson acting as engine driver and his son Robert as stoker. The  limited time I had for making my sketch prevented me from making a more  elaborate one, but such as it is, all the important and characteristic  details are given; but the pencil lines, after the lapse of fifty-four  years, have become somewhat indistinct.\" The pencil drawing, more than  fifty years old, has become so faint that its reproduction has become a  difficult task. Enough remains, however, to show very clearly what manner  of engine this Rocket was. For the sake of comparison we reproduce an  engraving of the Rocket of 1829. A glance will show that an astonishing  transformation had taken place in the eleven months which had elapsed  between the Rainhill trials and the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester  Railway. We may indicate a few of the alterations. In 1829 the cylinders  were set at a steep angle; in 1830 they were nearly horizontal. In 1829 the  driving wheels were of wood; in 1830 they were of cast iron. In 1829 there  was no smoke-box proper, and a towering chimney; in 1830 there was a  smoke-box and a comparatively short chimney. In 1829 a cask and a truck  constituted the tender; in 1830 there was a neatly designed tender, not  very different in style from that still in use on the Great Western broad  gauge. All these things may perhaps be termed concomitants, or changes in  detail. But there is a radical difference yet to be considered. In 1829 the  fire-box was a kind of separate chamber tacked on to the back of the barrel  of the boiler, and communicating with it by three tubes; one on each side  united the water spaces, and one at the top the steam spaces. In 1830 all  this had disappeared, and we find in Mr. Nasmyth's sketch a regular  fire-box, such as is used to this moment. In one word, the Rocket of 1829  is different from the Rocket of 1830 in almost every conceivable respect;  and we are driven perforce to the conclusion that the Rocket of 1829  _never worked at all on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; the engine of  1830 was an entirely new engine_. We see no possible way of escaping from  this conclusion. The most that can be said against it is that the engine  underwent many alterations. The alterations must, however, have been so  numerous that they were tantamount to the construction of a new engine. It  is difficult, indeed, to see what part of the old engine could exist in the  new one; some plates of the boiler shell might, perhaps, have been  retained, but we doubt it. It may, perhaps, disturb some hitherto well  rooted beliefs to say so, but it seems to us indisputable that the Rocket  of 1829 and 1830 were totally different engines.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. THE ROCKET, 1829. THE ROCKET, 1830.]    Our engraving, Fig. 1, is copied from a drawing made by Mr. Phipps,  M.I.C.E., who was employed by Messrs. Stephenson to compile a drawing of  the Rocket from such drawings and documents as could be found. This  gentleman had made the original drawings of the Rocket of 1829, under  Messrs. G. & R. Stephenson's direction. Mr. Phipps is quite silent about  the history of the engine during the eleven months between the Rainhill  trials and the opening of the railway. In this respect he is like every one  else. This period is a perfect blank. It is assumed that from Rainhill the  engine went back to Messrs. Stephenson's works; but there is nothing on the  subject in print, so far as we are aware. Mr. G.R. Stephenson lent us in  1880 a working model of the Rocket. An engraving of this will be found in  _The Engineer_ for September 17, 1880. The difference between it and the  engraving below, prepared from Mr. Phipps' drawing, is, it will be seen,  very small--one of proportions more than anything else. Mr. Stephenson says  of his model: \"I can say that it is a very fair representation of what the  engine was before she was altered.\" Hitherto it has always been taken for  granted that the alteration consisted mainly in reducing the angle at which  the cylinders were set. The Nasmyth drawing alters the whole aspect of the  question, and we are now left to speculate as to what became of the  original Rocket. We are told that after \"it\" left the railway it was  employed by Lord Dundonald to supply steam to a rotary engine; then it  propelled a steamboat; next it drove small machinery in a shop in  Manchester; then it was employed in a brickyard; eventually it was  purchased as a curiosity by Mr. Thomson, of Kirkhouse, near Carlisle, who  sent it to Messrs. Stephenson to take care of. With them it remained for  years. Then Messrs. Stephenson put it into something like its original  shape, and it went to South Kensington Museum, where \"it\" is now. The  question is, What engine is this? Was it the Rocket of 1829 or the Rocket  of 1830, or neither? It could not be the last, as will be understood from  Mr. Nasmyth's drawing; if we bear in mind that the so-called fire-box on  the South Kensington engine is only a sham made of thin "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11740"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[Illustration: Tomb of Gower, the Poet.]    Dr. Johnson has dignified Gower with the character of \"THE FATHER OF  ENGLISH POETRY\"; so that no apology is required for the introduction of  the above memorial in our pages. It stands in the north aisle of the  church of St. Mary Ovrie, or St. Saviour, Southwark; and is one of the  richest monuments within those hallowed walls. The tomb consists of three  Gothic arches, the roof of which springs into several angles. The arches  are richly ornamented with cinnquefoil tracery, roses, and carved work of  exquisite character. Behind these arches are two rows of trefoil niches;  and between them also rises a square column, of the Doric order,  surmounted by carved pinnacles. On the extremity of the arches is placed  richly carved foliage, of a similar character to that which ornaments  the edges of the arches; and in the centre are circles enclosing  quatrefoils. From the bases of the two middle square columns descend  roses, and other foliage; and from the lower extremities of the interior  arches descend cherubim. Within three painted niches, are the figures of  Charity, Mercy, and Pity, round whom are entwined golden scrolls bearing  the following inscriptions:      \"_Pour la Pitie Jesu regarde.    Et tiens cest Ami en saufve Garde_.\"      Jesu! for thy compassion's sake look down,    And guard this soul as if it were thine own.    On the second scroll is written:        \"_Oh, bon Jesu! faite Mercy,    Al' Ame dont le Corps gist icy_.\"        Oh! good Jesu! Mercy shew      To him whose body lies below.    On the third scroll is written:      \"_En toy qui es Fitz de Dieu le Pere,    Saufve soit qui gist sours cest Pierre_.\"      May he who lies beneath this stone,    Be sav'd in thee, God's only son![1]        [1] These translations are somewhat freely made.    Between each of these figures are painted blank trefoil niches; and below  the whole, on a plain tablet, the following inscription:        \"Armiger scutum nihil a modo fut tibi tutum,      Reddidit immolutum, morti generali tributum,      Spiritus exutum se gaudeat esse solutum,      Est ubi vistutum, Regnum sive labe statutum.\"    On the left side:        \"Hoc viri      Inter inclytos memorandi      Monumentum sepulchrali,      Restaurari propriis impensis      Parocnia hujus meolae            Curaverunt      A.D.

And below the effigy runs the following:--        \"_Hic jacet JOHANNIS GOWER,      Armiger, Anglorum Poeta celeberrimus,      ac huic sacro Edificio Benefactor, insignis      temporibus Edw. III. et Rich. II._\"        Here lieth John Gower, esq., a celebrated      English poet, also a benefactor to      this sacred edifice, in the time of Edward      III. and Richard II.    The base of the monument has seven trefoil niches, within as many  plain-pointed ones.    The effigy of the poet is placed above, in a recumbent posture, beneath  the canopy just described. He is dressed in a gown, originally purple,  covering his feet, which rest on the neck of a lion. A coronet of roses  adorns his head, which is raised by three folio volumes, labelled on  their respective ends, \"Vox Clamantis,\" \"Speculum Meditantis,\" and  \"Confessio Amantis.\" Round the neck hangs a collar of SSS. Over the lion,  on the side of the monument, are the arms of the deceased, hanging, by  the dexter corner, from an ancient French chappeau, bearing his crest.  The dress of this effigy has, probably, given rise to the conjectures  concerning the rank in life which Gower maintained; but that is too  precarious a ground on which to form a decided opinion on such a point.    Gower's arms are, Argent on a cheveron, azure, three leopard's heads, Or.  Crest. On a chappeau turned up with ermine, a talbot, serjant, proper.    A little eastward of Gower's monument is part of a pillar, descending  from the roof, with a conical base. It is said to be hollow, and has,  indeed, somewhat the appearance of a narrow chimney flue.    A biographical outline of Gower may not be unacceptable. He is said by  Leland to have descended from a family settled at Sittenham, in  Yorkshire. He was liberally educated, and was a member of the Inner  Temple; and some have asserted that he became Chief Justice of the Common  Pleas; but the most general opinion is that the judge was another person  of the same name. It is certain that Gower was a person of considerable  weight in his time; even had he not given such ample proofs of his wealth  and munificence in rebuilding the conventual church of St. Mary Ouvrie,  If he did not actually rebuild the church, as has been asserted, it is  well known that he contributed very largely to that undertaking. Perhaps  the only fact in detail which it is now possible to ascertain with  certainty is, that he founded a chantry in the chapel of St. John, now  the vestry.    Gower is supposed to have been born before Chaucer, who flourished in the  early part of the fourteenth century, and is believed to have contracted  an acquaintance with Gower during his residence in the Middle Temple.  Chaucer himself, after his travels on the continent, became a student of  the Inner Temple. The contiguity of these inns of court, the similarity  of their studies and pursuits, and particularly, as they both possessed  the same political bias; Chaucer attaching himself to John of Ghent, Duke  of Lancaster, by whom, as well as by the Duchess Blanche, he was greatly  esteemed; and Gower giving his influence to Thomas of Woodstock, both  uncles to King Richard II.--would naturally produce a considerable degree  of friendship and esteem between the two poets.    Gower did not long survive his friend Chaucer. In the first year of the  reign of Henry IV. he appears to have lost his sight; but whether from  accident or from old age (for he was then greatly advanced in years) is  not known. This misfortune happened but a short period before his death,  which took place in the year 1402, about nine years after he had  completed the \"Confessio Amantis,\" a work from whence he derived the  honour of being ranked among the English poets.    The \"Confessio\" of Gower is said to have owed its origin to a request  made to the poet by King Richard II.; who, accidentally meeting Gower on  the Thames, called him into the royal barge, and enjoined him \"to booke  some new thing.\" This, therefore, was not the first of his poetical  productions, though it is universally admitted to have been his chief,  and that on which his principal reputation depends; and into which \"it  seems to have been his ambition to crowd all his erudition.\" It is,  however, the last of the volumes, the titles which are painted on his  monument in this church, and is supposed to be the last he ever wrote, at  least of any important extent.    The poetical histories of Gower and Chaucer are intimately connected; yet  there is a remarkable difference of opinion and pursuit in their  respective writings. It must be confessed that to Chaucer, and not to  Gower, should be applied the flattering appellation of \"the father of our  poetry;\" though, as Johnson says, he was the first of our authors who can  be said to have written English. To Chaucer, however, are we indebted for  the first effort to emancipate the British muse from the ridiculous  trammels of French diction, with which, till his time, it had been the  fashion to interlard and obscure the English language. Gower, on the  contrary, from a close intimacy with the French and Latin poets, found it  easier to follow the beaten track. His first work was, therefore, written  in French measure, and is entitled \"Speculum Meditantis.\" There are two  copies of this book now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It contains  ten books, and consists of a collection of precepts and examples,  compiled from various authors, recommending the chastity of the marriage  bed.    Gower's next work was a Latin production, entitled, \"Vox Clamantis,\" of  which there are many copies still extant. The unfortunate reign of the  poet's royal patron, and the rebellion of Wat Tyler, furnished Gower with  ample materials for this publication.--The \"Confessio Amantis\" was first  printed in the year 1403, by Caxton.    There is a MS. in Trinity College, Cambridge, consisting of several small  poems by Gower; but they are nearly destitute of merit. The French  sonnets, however, of which there is a volume in the Marquess of  Stafford's library, are spoken of by Mr. Warton, who has given a long  account of them, with specimens, as possessing more merit.    The \"Boke of Philip Sparrow,\" by the witty, but obscene Skelton, who  wrote towards the close of the fifteenth century, says that \"Gower's  Englishe is old;\" but the learned Dean Collet, in the early part of the  succeeding century, studied not only Gower, but Chaucer, and even  Lydgate, in order to improve and correct his own style. By the close of  that century, however, the language of these writers was become entirely  obsolete.    The \"Confessio Amantis\" was printed, a second time, by Barthelet, in the  year 1532; a third time in 1544; a fourth in 1554; and, lastly, in a very  correct and worthy manner, in the year 1810, under the judicious  inspection of Dr. Chalmers.    It were ungrateful to withhold from Gower some acknowledgment of the  share he had in producing a beneficial revolution in the English  language; as it would be absurd and untrue to attribute to him any great  degree of praise, as an _inventor_ in that important work.           *       * "]]]
