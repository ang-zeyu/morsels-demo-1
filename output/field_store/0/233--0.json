Having settled in a place one might suppose the  \"influences of civilization\" would first be felt by the people  nearest that place. Instead of which, a number of men go forth in a  ship and carry civilization as far away from that spot as the winds  will bear them.    When a stone falls in a pool each part of each ripple is equally  distant from the spot where the stone fell; but if the stone of  civilization were to have fallen, for instance, into New Orleans,  equally near to that spot we would find the people of New York City  and the naked Indians of Yucatan. Civilization does not radiate, or  diffuse. It leaps; and as to where it will next strike it is as  independent as forked lightning. During hundreds of years it passed  over the continent of Africa to settle only at its northern coast  line and its most southern cape; and, to-day, it has given Cuba all  of its benefits, and has left the equally beautiful island of Hayti,  only fourteen hours away, sunk in fetish worship and brutal  ignorance.    One of the places it has chosen to ignore is the West Coast of  Africa. We are familiar with the Northern Coast and South Africa. We  know all about Morocco and the picturesque Raisuli, Lord Cromer, and  Shepheard's Hotel. The Kimberley Diamond Mines, the Boer War,  Jameson's Raid, and Cecil Rhodes have made us know South Africa, and  on the East Coast we supply Durban with buggies and farm wagons,  furniture from Grand Rapids, and, although we have nothing against  Durban, breakfast food and canned meats. We know Victoria Falls,  because they have eclipsed our own Niagara Falls, and Zanzibar,  farther up the Coast, is familiar through comic operas and rag-time.  Of itself, the Cape to Cairo Railroad would make the East Coast  known to us. But the West Coast still means that distant shore from  whence the \"first families\" of Boston, Bristol and New Orleans  exported slaves. Now, for our soap and our salad, the West Coast  supplies palm oil and kernel oil, and for automobile tires, rubber.  But still to it there cling the mystery, the hazard, the cruelty of  those earlier times. It is not of palm oil and rubber one thinks  when he reads on the ship's itinerary, \"the Gold Coast, the Ivory  Coast, the Bight of Benin, and Old Calabar.\"    One of the strange leaps made by civilization is from Southampton to  Cape Town, and one of its strangest ironies is in its ignoring all  the six thousand miles of coast line that lies between. Nowadays, in  winter time, the English, flying from the damp cold of London, go to  Cape Town as unconcernedly as to the Riviera. They travel in great  seagoing hotels, on which they play cricket, and dress for dinner.  Of the damp, fever-driven coast line past which, in splendid ease,  they are travelling, save for the tall peaks of Teneriffe and Cape  Verde, they know nothing.    When last Mrs. Davis and I made that voyage from Southampton, the  decks were crowded chiefly with those English whose faces are  familiar at the Savoy and the Ritz, and who, within an hour, had  settled down to seventeen days of uninterrupted bridge, with, before  them, the prospect on landing of the luxury of the Mount Nelson and  the hospitalities of Government House. When, the other day, we again  left Southampton, that former departure came back in strange  contrast. It emphasized that this time we are not accompanying  civilization on one of her flying leaps. Instead, now, we are going  down to the sea in ships with the vortrekkers of civilization, those  who are making the ways straight; who, in a few weeks, will be  leaving us to lose themselves in great forests, who clear the paths  of noisome jungles where the sun seldom penetrates, who sit in  sun-baked \"factories,\" as they call their trading houses, measuring  life by steamer days, who preach the Gospel to the cannibals of the  Congo, whose voices are the voices of those calling in the  wilderness.    As our tender came alongside the _Bruxellesville_ at Southampton, we  saw at the winch Kroo boys of the Ivory Coast; leaning over the rail  the Soeurs Blanches of the Congo, robed, although the cold was  bitter and the decks black with soot-stained snow, all in white;  missionaries with long beards, a bishop in a purple biretta, and  innumerable Belgian officers shivering in their cloaks and wearing  the blue ribbon and silver star that tells of three years of service  along the Equator. This time our fellow passengers are no  pleasure-seekers, no Cook's tourists sailing south to avoid a  rigorous winter. They have squeezed the last minute out of their  leave, and they are going back to the station, to the factory, to  the mission, to the barracks. They call themselves \"Coasters,\" and  they inhabit a world all to themselves. In square miles, it is a  very big world, but it is one of those places civilization has  skipped.    Nearly every one of our passengers from Antwerp or Southampton knows  that if he keeps his contract, and does not die, it will be three  years before he again sees his home. So our departure was not  enlivening, and, in the smoking-room, the exiles prepared us for  lonely ports of call, for sickening heat, for swarming multitudes of  blacks.    In consequence, when we passed Finisterre, Spain, which from New  York seems almost a foreign country, was a near neighbor, a dear  friend. And the Island of Teneriffe was an anticlimax. It was as  though by a trick of the compass we had been sailing southwest and  were entering the friendly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#1)"],[1,"STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE    By E. Nesbit               \"It may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be       collected a system of civil and economical prudence.  He has       been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be       doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of       theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence       can be collected than he alone has given to his country.\"--       Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.          PREFACE        The writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed \"the richest, the  purest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.\"    Shakespeare instructed by delighting. His plays alone (leaving mere  science out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the  whole body of English learning. He is the teacher of all good-- pity,  generosity, true courage, love. His bright wit is cut out \"into little  stars.\" His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and  proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the  English-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage  which he does not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though  often unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his friend, Ben Jonson,  wrote of him, \"He was not of an age but for all time.\" He ever kept the  highroad of human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths  of feeling and sentiment. In his creations we have no moral highwaymen,  sentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant  adventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in which  the grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the  superficial attraction of style and sentiment. He flattered no bad  passion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just  and generous principle. While causing us to laugh at folly, and shudder  at crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and our  reverence for ourselves.    Shakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with  all that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of  that indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and  clear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland  solitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of  poetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to  mental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in  the midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of  sunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or  repulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter  elements.    These things considered, what wonder is it that the works of  Shakespeare, next to the Bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the  classics of English literature. \"So extensively have the characters of  Shakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,\"  says an American author,--\"So interwoven are these characters in the  great body of English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of  these dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.\"    But Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in  words that little folks cannot understand.    Hence this volume. To reproduce the entertaining stories contained  in the plays of Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can  understand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of  these Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare.    And that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing any  unfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has prepared  and included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of Difficult Names.  To which is added a collection of Shakespearean Quotations, classified  in alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the  world's greatest dramatist.    E. T. R.          A BRIEF LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.        In the register of baptisms of the parish church of Stratford-upon-Avon,  a market town in Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April 26,  1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the son of John Shakspeare.  The entry is in Latin--\"Gulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.\"    The date of William Shakespeare's birth has usually been taken as three  days before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this  fact.    The family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always  spelling it in the same way. While in the baptismal record the name is  spelled \"Shakspeare,\" in several authentic autographs of the dramatist  it reads \"Shakspere,\" and in the first edition of his works it is  printed \"Shakespeare.\"    Halliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways in  which the various members of the Shakespeare family wrote the name,  and in the council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is  introduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that  the dramatist's father was a member of the municipal body, there are  fourteen different spellings. The modern \"Shakespeare\" is not among  them.    Shakespeare's father, while an alderman at Stratford, appears to have  been unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of  ten were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is not  specially to his discredit.    The traditions and other sources of information about the occupation  of Shakespeare's father differ. He is described as a butcher, a  woolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may have  been all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that if  he could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of his  occupation was such as to make it easy to understand how the various  traditions sprang up. He was a landed proprietor and cultivator of his  own land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, who  was Mary Arden, daughter of a country gentleman, the estate of Asbies,  56 acres in extent. William was the third child. The two older than he  were daughters, and both probably died in infancy. After him was born  three sons and a daughter. For ten or twelve years at least, after  Shakespeare's birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances. In  the year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of Stratford,  and for many years afterwards he held the position of alderman as he  had done for three years before. To the completion of his tenth year,  therefore, it is natural to suppose that William Shakespeare would get  the best education that Stratford could afford. The free school of the  town was open to all boys and like all the grammar-schools of that time,  was under the direction of men who, as graduates of the universities,  were qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once the  boast of England. There is no record of Shakespeare's having been at  this school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educated  there. His father could not have procured for him a better education  anywhere. To those who have studied Shakespeare's works without being  influenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a very  narrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have been  solidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught in the  grammar schools.    There are local associations connected with Stratford which could not  be without their influence in the formation of young Shakespeare's mind.  Within the range of such a boy's curiosity were the fine old historic  towns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the  grand monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon abounded with spots of  singular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut  out from the general world, as many country towns are. It was a great  highway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its  markets. The eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for  observation. But nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his  birth to his marriage to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date  nothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor in  London about 1589.    How long acting continued to be Shakespeare's sole profession we have  no means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very  soon after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which  he is known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter  older plays not up to the standard that was required at the time was  a common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and  Shakespeare's abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted  for this kind of work. When the alterations in plays originally composed  by other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation would  become in reality a work of creation. And this is exactly what we have  examples of in a few of Shakespeare's early works, which are known to  have been founded on older plays.    It is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world's  greatest dramatist. Criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the  finest minds of England, Germany, and America have devoted their powers  to an elucidation of their worth.    Shakespeare died at Stratford on the 23rd of April, 1616. His father had  died before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. His wife survived  him till August, 1623. His so Hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven  years. His two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, Susanna, had,  in 1607, married a physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of  this marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first  Thomas Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by  either marriage. Shakespeare's younger daughter, Judith, on the 10th of  February, 1616, married a Stratford gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by  whom she had three sons, all of whom"]]]
