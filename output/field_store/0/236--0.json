PREFACE      A book of this kind, though addressed to children, must necessarily  reach them through an older person. The purpose is to suggest a few of  the many aspects which music may have even to the mind of a child. If  these chapters, or whatever may be logically suggested by them, be  actually used as the basis of simple Talks with children, music may  become to them more than drill and study. They should know it as an  art, full of beauty and of dignity; full of pure thought and abounding  in joy. Music with these characteristics is the true music of the  heart. Unless music gives true pleasure to the young it may be doubted  if it is wisely studied.    Our failure to present music to the young in a manner that interests  and holds them is due not so much to the fact that music is too  difficult for children, but because the children themselves are too  difficult for us. In our ignorance we often withhold the rightful  inheritance. We must not forget that the slower adult mind often meets  a class of difficulties which are not recognized by the unprejudiced  child. It is not infrequent that with the old fears in us we persist  in recreating difficulties.    There should be ever present with the teacher the thought that music  must be led out of the individuality, not driven into it.    The teacher's knowledge is not a hammer, it is a light.    While it is suggested that these chapters be used as the  subject-matter for talks with the children, they may read verbatim if  desired. All foot-note references and suggestions are addressed to the  older person--the mother or the teacher. There is much in the  literature of art that would interest children if given to them  discriminatingly.    THOMAS TAPPER.

It is made up of talks to students,  calculated to make them think; of hints and suggestions which will be  of immense assistance to those who are earnestly trying to become  proficient in music.\"--_Boston Transcript._    \"No other book covers the same broad field which this covers in such a  pleasant and inspiring manner.\"--_The Writer (Boston)._      The Music Life and How to Succeed in it.    \"These ideas are worthy of attention from students and workers in all  branches of art, science, and literature, who mean to be serious and  earnest.\"--_Boston Transcript._    \"Exceedingly valuable because of its broad impartiality in its  exposition of truth, its depth of understanding, and, above all, for  its earnest desire, manifest in every word, to lead music students to  a love for music itself.... It abounds in high artistic thought and  insight.\"--_The Boston Times._          CHAPTER I.    WHAT THE FACE TELLS.        \"And the light _dwelleth_ with him.\"--_Daniel II: 22._      Once a master said to a child:    \"If thou wilt study diligently, learn, and do good unto others, thy  face shall be filled with light.\"    So the child studied busily, learned, and sought how she could do good  unto others. And every little while she ran to the glass to see if the  light was coming. But at each time she was disappointed. No light was  there. Try as faithfully as she would, and look as often as she would,  it was always the same.    I do not know if she doubted the master or not; but it is certain she  did not know what to make of it. She grieved, and day after day her  disappointment grew. At length she could bear it no longer, so she  went to the master and said:    \"Dear master, I have been so diligent! I have tried to learn and to do  good unto others. Yet every time I have sought in my face the light  _which you promised_, it has not been there. No, not a single time.\"    Now the master listened intently, and watching her face as she spoke,  he said:    \"Thou poor little one, in this moment, as thou hast spoken to me, thy  face has been so filled with light that thou wouldst not believe. And  dost thou know why? It is because every word thou hast spoken in this  moment has come from thy heart.    \"Thou must learn _in the first days_ this lesson: When the thought and  the deed are in the heart, then the light is in the face, always, and  it is there at no other time. It could not be. And what is in thy  heart when thou art before the glass? In that moment hast thou turned  away from diligence, and from learning, and from the love of doing  good unto others and in thy heart there is left only the poor  curiosity to see the light which can never shine when it is sought.  Thou canst never see the light of thy own face. For thee that light is  forever within, and it will not prosper thy way to want to look upon  it. It is only as thou art faithful that this is added unto thee.\"    Sorrowing yet more than before the little child said:    \"Master, I do not understand what thou hast said, yet I believe thee;  but the wish is yet within me to see the light of my face, if only for  once. Thou who art wise, tell me why it is denied me.\"    And the master made answer:    \"It is denied to us all. No one may see the light of his own face.  Therefore thou shalt labor daily with diligence that thy light shall  shine before others. And if thou wouldst see the light thou shalt  cause it to shine _in another_. That is the greatest of all--to bring  forth the light. And to do this, thou shalt of thyself be faithful in  all things. By what thou art thou must show diligence, the love for  learning, and the desire to do good unto others, even as these things  have been taught thee.\"          CHAPTER II.    WHY WE SHOULD STUDY MUSIC.        \"Music makes people more gentle and meek, more modest and    understanding.\"--_Martin Luther._[1]    It was this same music lover who said once, \"Music is the fairest gift  of God.\" Just these words should be a sufficient answer to the  question which we have asked in this Talk, but a little more may make  it clearer. Here we are, gathered together to talk about music. We  know music is pleasing; to many of us it is even more than a pleasure;  of course, it is difficult to get the lessons properly and we must  struggle and strive. Often the way seems so rude and stony that we  cannot advance. We are hurt, and hot tears of discouragement come, and  we sit down dejected feeling it were best never to try again. But even  when the tears flow the fastest we feel something within us which  makes us listen. We can really hear our thoughts battling to tell us  something,--prompted by the heart, we may be sure.    And what is music making our thoughts say?    \"Have I not been a pleasure and a comfort to you? Have I not set you  to singing and to dancing many and many times? Have I not let you sing  your greatest happiness? And am I not ever about you, at home, in  school, in church? even in the streets I have never deserted you.  Always, _always_ I have made you merry. But this was music you  _heard_. Now you have said you wished to know me yourself; to have me  come to dwell in your heart that you might have me understandingly,  and because I ask labor of you for this, you sit here with your hot  tears in your eyes and not a bit of me present in your heart. Listen!  Am I not there? Yes, just a bit. Now more and more, and now will you  give me up because I make you work a little?\"    Well, we all have just this experience and we always feel ashamed of  our discouragements; but even this does not tell us why we should  study music. Some people study it because they have to do so; others  because they love it. Surely it must be best with those who out of  their hearts choose to learn about tones and the messages they tell.    Did you ever notice how people seem willing to stop any employment if  music comes near? Even in the busiest streets of a city the organ-man  will make us listen to his tunes. In spite of the hurry and the crowd  and the jumble of noises, still the organ-tones go everywhere clear,  full, melodious, bidding us heed them. Perhaps we mark the music with  the hand, or walk differently, or begin to sing with it. In one way or  another the music will make us do something--that shows its power. I  have seen in many European towns a group of children about the  organ-man,[2] dancing or singing as he played and enjoying every tune  to the utmost. This taught me that music of every kind has its lover,  and that with a little pains and a little patience the love for music  belongs to all alike, and may be increased if other things do not push  it aside.    Now, one of the first things to be said of music is that it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#1)"],[1,"DAWN AND THE DAY    Or, The Buddha and the Christ, Part I    by    HENRY T. NILES    The Blade Printing & Paper Company  Toledo, Ohio    1894                PREFACE.    When Humboldt first ascended the Andes and saw the trees, shrubs and  flora he had long before studied on the Alps, he had only to look at  his barometer, or at the sea of mountains and hills below, the rocks  and soil around, and the sun above, to understand this seeming marvel  of creation; while those who knew less of the laws of order and  universal harmony might be lost in conjectures about pollen floating in  the upper air, or seeds carried by birds across seas, forgetting that  preservation is perpetual creation, and that it takes no more power to  clothe a mountain just risen from the sea in appropriate verdure than  to renew the beauty and the bloom of spring.    Max Mueller, who looks through antiquity with the same clear vision  with which Humboldt examined the physical world, when he found the most  ancient Hindoos bowing in worship before Dyaus Pitar, the exact  equivalent of the Zeus Pater of the Greeks and the Jupiter of the  Romans, and of \"Our Father who art in the heavens\" in our own divinely  taught prayer, instead of indulging in wild speculations about the  chance belief of some ancient chief or patriarch, transmitted across  continents and seas and even across the great gulf that has always  divided the Aryan from the Semitic civilization and preserved through  ages of darkness and unbelief, saw in it the common yearning of the  human soul to find rest on a loving Father's almighty arm; yet when our  oriental missionaries and scholars found such fundamental truths of  their own religion as the common brotherhood of man, and that love is  the vital force of all religion, which consists not in blood-oblations  or in forms and creeds, but in shunning evil and doing good, and that  we must overcome evil by good and hatred by love, and that there is a  spiritual world and life after death embodied in the teachings of  Buddha--instead of finding in this great fact new proof of the common  Father's love for all His children, they immediately began to indulge  in conjectures as to how these truths might have been derived from the  early Christians who visited the East, while those who were disposed to  reject the claims of Christianity have exhausted research and  conjecture to find something looking as if Christianity itself might  have been derived from the Buddhist missionaries to Palestine and  Egypt, both overlooking the remarkable fact that it is only in  fundamental truths that the two religions agree, while in the dogmas,  legends, creeds and speculations which form the wall of separation  between them they are as wide asunder as the poles.    How comes it on the one theory that the Nestorians, whose peculiar  creed had already separated them from the balance of the Christian  church, taught their Buddhist disciples no part of that creed to which  they have adhered with such tenacity through the ages?  And on the  other theory, how comes it, if the Divine Master was, as some modern  writers claim, an Essene, that is, a Buddhist monk, that there is not  in all his teachings a trace of the speculations and legends which had  already buried the fundamental truths of Buddhism almost out of sight?    How sad to hear a distinguished Christian scholar like Sir Monier  Williams cautioning his readers against giving a Christian meaning to  the Christian expressions he constantly met with in Buddhism, and yet  informing them that a learned and distinguished Japanese gentleman told  him it was a source of great delight to him to find so many of his most  cherished religious beliefs in the New Testament; and to see an earnest  Christian missionary like good Father Huc, when in the busy city of  Lha-ssa, on the approach of evening, at the sound of a bell the whole  population sunk on their knees in a concert of prayer, only finding in  it an attempt of Satan to counterfeit Christian worship; and on the  other hand to see ancient and modern learning ransacked to prove that  the brightest and clearest light that ever burst upon a sinful and  benighted world was but the reflected rays of another faith.    And yet this same Sir Monier Williams says: \"We shall not be far wrong  in attempting an outline of the Buddha's life if we begin by assuming  that intense individuality, fervid earnestness and severe simplicity,  combined with singular beauty of countenance, calm dignity of bearing,  and almost superhuman persuasiveness of speech, were conspicuous in the  great teacher.\"  To believe that such a character was the product of a  false religion, or that he was given over to believe a lie, savors too  much of that worst agnosticism which would in effect deny the  universality of God's love and would limit His care to some favored  locality or age or race.    How much more in harmony with the broad philosophy of such men as  Humboldt and Mueller, and with the character of a loving Father, to  believe that at all times and in all countries He has been watching  over all His children and giving them all the light they were capable  of receiving.    This narrow view is especially out of place in treating of Buddhism and  Christianity, as Buddha himself predicted that his Dharma would last  but five hundred years, when he would be succeeded by Matreya, that is,  Love incarnate, on which account the whole Buddhist world was on tiptoe  of expectation at the time of the coming of our Lord, so that the wise  men of the East were not only following their guiding-star but the  prediction of their own great prophet in seeking Bethlehem.    Had the Christian missionaries to the East left behind them their  creeds, which have only served to divide Christians into hostile sects  and sometimes into hostile camps, and which so far as I can see, after  years of patient study, have no necessary connection with the simple,  living truths taught by our Saviour, and had taken only their New  Testaments and their earnest desire to do good, the history of missions  would have been widely different.    How of the earth earthy seemed the walls that divided the delegates to  the world's great Congress of Religions, recently held in Chicago, and  how altogether divine      The love which like an endless golden chain    Joined all in one.    Whatever others may think, it is my firm belief that Buddhism and  Christianity, which we cannot doubt have influenced for good such vast  masses the human family, both descended from heaven clothed in robes of  celestial purity which have become sadly stained by their contact with  the selfishness of a sinful world, except for which belief the  following pages would never have been written, which are now sent forth  in the hope that they may do something to enable Buddhists and  Christians to see eye to eye and something to promote peace and  good-will among men.    While following my own conceptions and even fancies in many things, I  believe the leading characters and incidents to be historical, and I  have given nothing as the teaching of the great master which was not to  my mind clearly authenticated.    To those who have read so much about agnostic Buddhism, and about  Nirvana meaning annihilation, it may seem bold in me to present Buddha  as an undoubting believer in the fundamental truths of all religion,  and as not only a believer in a spiritual world but an actual visitor  to its sad and blissful scenes; but the only agnosticism I have been  able to trace to Buddha was a want of faith in the many ways invented  through the ages to escape the consequences of sin and to avoid the  necessity of personal purification, and the only annihilation he taught  and yearned for was the annihilation of self in the highest Christian  sense, and escape from that body of death from which the Apostle Paul  so earnestly sought deliverance.    Doubtless agnosticism and almost every form of belief and unbelief  subsequently sprang up among the intensely acute and speculative  peoples of the East known under the general name of Buddhists, as they  did among the less acute and speculative peoples of the West known as  Christians; but the one is no more primitive Buddhism than the other is  primitive Christianity.    While there are innumerable poetic legends--of which Spence Hardy's  \"Manual of Buddhism\" is a great storehouse, and many of which are given  by Arnold in his beautiful poem--strewn thick along the track of  Buddhist literature, constantly tempting one to leave the straight path  of the development of a great religion, I have carefully avoided what  did not commend itself to my mind as either historical or spiritual  truth.    It was my original design to follow the wonderful career of Buddha  until his long life closed with visions of the golden city much as  described in Revelation, and then to follow that most wonderful career  of Buddhist missions, not only through India and Ceylon, but to  Palestine, Greece and Egypt, and over the table-lands of Asia and  through the Chinese Empire to Japan, and thence by the black stream to  Mexico and Central America, and then to follow the wise men of the East  until the Light of the world dawned on them on the plains of  Bethlehem--a task but half accomplished, which I shall yet complete if  life and strength are spared.    A valued literary friend suggests that the social life described in the  following pages is too much like ours, but why should their daily life  and social customs be greatly different from ours?  The Aryan  migrations to India and to Europe were in large masses, of course  taking their social customs, or as the Romans would say, their  household gods, with them.    What wonder, then, that the home as Tacitus describes it in the \"Wilds  of Germany\" was substantially what Mueller finds from the very  structure of the Sanscrit and European languages it must have"]]]
