Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male beings,  and the goddess Saraswati also, must the word _Jaya_ be uttered.    Janamejaya said, \"O thou foremost of regenerate ones, deceitfully  defeated at dice by the sons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors,  incensed by those wicked ones that thus brought about a fierce  animosity, and addressed in language that was so cruel, what did the  Kuru princes, my ancestors--the sons of Pritha--(then) do? How also did  the sons of Pritha, equal unto Sakra in prowess, deprived of affluence  and suddenly overwhelmed with misery, pass their days in the forest? Who  followed the steps of those princes plunged in excess of affliction? And  how did those high souled ones bear themselves and derive their  sustenance, and where did they put up? And, O illustrious ascetic and  foremost of Brahmanas, how did those twelve years (of exile) of those  warriors who were slayers of foes, pass away in the forest? And  undeserving of pain, how did that princess, the best of her sex, devoted  to her husbands, eminently virtuous, and always speaking the truth,  endure that painful exile in the forest? O thou of ascetic wealth tell  me all this in detail, for, O Brahmana, I desire to hear thee narrate  the history of those heroes possessed of abundant prowess and lustre.  Truly my curiosity is great.\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Thus defeated at dice and incensed by the wicked  sons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors, the sons of Pritha set out  from Hastinapura. And issuing through _Vardhamana_ gate of the city, the  Pandavas bearing their weapons and accompanied by Draupadi set out in a  northerly direction. Indrasena and others, with servants numbering  altogether fourteen, with their wives, followed them on swift cars. And  the citizens learning of their departure became overwhelmed with sorrow,  and began to censure Bhishma and Vidura and Drona and Gautama. And  having met together they thus addressed one another fearlessly.    \"'Alas, our families, we ourselves, and our homes are all gone, when the  wicked Duryodhana, backed by the son of Suvala, by Karna and Dussasana,  aspireth to this kingdom. And, Oh, our families, our (ancestral) usages,  our virtue and prosperity, are all doomed where this sinful wretch  supported by wretches as sinful aspireth to the kingdom! And, Oh, how  can happiness be there where these are not! Duryodhana beareth malice  towards all superiors, hath taken leave of good conduct, and quarreleth  with those that are near to him in blood. Covetous and vain and mean, he  is cruel by nature. The whole earth is doomed when Duryodhana becometh  its ruler. Thither, therefore, let us proceed whither the merciful and  high-minded sons of Pandu with passions under control and victorious  over foes, and possessed of modesty and renown, and devoted to pious  practices, repair!'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"And saying this, the citizens went after the  Pandavas, and having met them, they all, with joined hands, thus  addressed the sons of Kunti and Madri.    \"'Blest be ye! Where will ye go, leaving us in grief? We will follow you  whithersoever ye will go! Surely have we been distressed upon learning  that ye have been deceitfully vanquished by relentless enemies! It  behoveth you not to forsake us that are your loving subjects and devoted  friends always seeking your welfare and employed in doing what is  agreeable to you! We desire not to be overwhelmed in certain destruction  living in the dominions of the Kuru king. Ye bulls among men, listen as  we indicate the merits and demerits springing respectively from  association with what is good and bad! As cloth, water, the ground, and  sesame seeds are perfumed by association with flowers, even so are  qualities ever the product of association. Verily association with fools  produceth an illusion that entangleth the mind, as daily communion with  the good and the wise leadeth to the practice of virtue. Therefore, they  that desire emancipation should associate with those that are wise and  old and honest and pure in conduct and possessed of ascetic merit. They  should be waited upon whose triple possessions, _viz_., knowledge (of  the _Vedas_), origin and acts, are all pure, and association with them  is even superior to (the study of the) scriptures. Devoid of the  religious acts as we are, we shall yet reap religious merit by  association with the righteous, as we should come by sin by waiting upon  the sinful. The very sight and touch of the dishonest, and converse and  association with them, cause diminution of virtue, and men (that are  doomed to these), never attain purity of mind. Association with the base  impaireth the understanding, as, indeed, with the indifferent maketh it  indifferent, while communion with the good ever exalteth it. All those  attributes which are spoken of in the world as the sources of religious  merit, of worldly prosperity and sensual pleasures, which are regarded  by the people, extolled in the _Vedas_, and approved by the  well-behaved, exist in you, separately and jointly! Therefore, desirous  of our own welfare, we wish to live amongst you who possess those  attributes!'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Blessed are we since the people with the Brahmanas  at their head, moved by affection and compassion credit us with merits  we have not. I, however, with my brothers, would ask all of you to do  one thing. Ye should not, through affection and pity for us, act  otherwise! Our grandfather Bhishma, the king (Dhritarashtra), Vidura, my  mother and most of my well-wishers, are all in the city of Hastinapura.  Therefore, if ye are minded to seek our welfare, cherish ye them with  care, uniting together as they are overwhelmed with sorrow and  afflictions. Grieved at our departure, ye have come far! Go ye back, and  let your hearts be directed with tenderness towards the relatives I  entrust to you as pledges! This, of all others, is the one act upon  which my heart is set, and by doing this ye would give me great  satisfaction and pay me your best regards!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus exhorted by Yudhishthira the just, the  people in a body set up a loud wail exclaiming,--_Alas, O king!_ And  afflicted and overwhelmed with sorrow on remembering the virtues of  Pritha's son, they unwillingly retraced their steps asking leave of the  Pandavas.    \"The citizens having ceased to follow, the Pandavas ascended their cars,  and setting out reached (the site of) the mighty banian tree called  _Pramana_ on the banks of the Ganges. And reaching the site of the  banian tree about the close of the day, the heroic sons of Pandu  purified themselves by touching the sacred water, and passed the night  there. And afflicted with woe they spent that night taking water alone  as their sole sustenance. Certain Brahmanas belonging to both classes,  _viz_., those that maintained the sacrificial fire and those that  maintained it not, who had, with their disciples and relatives, out of  affection followed the Pandavas thither also passed the night with them.  And surrounded by those utterers of _Brahma_, the king shone resplendent  in their midst. And that evening, at once beautiful and terrible, those  Brahmanas having lighted their (sacred) fires, began to chant the  _Vedas_ and hold mutual converse. And those foremost of Brahmanas, with  swan-sweet voices spent the night, comforting that best of Kurus--the  king.\"      SECTION II    Vaisampayana said, \"When that night passed away and day broke in, those  Brahmanas who supported themselves by mendicancy, stood before the  Pandavas of exalted deeds, who were about to enter the forest. Then king  Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressed them, saying, 'Robbed of our  prosperity and kingdom, robbed of everything, we are about to enter the  deep woods in sorrow, depending for our food on fruits and roots, and  the produce of the chase. The forest too is full of dangers, and abounds  with reptiles and beasts of prey. It appeareth to me that ye will  certainly have to suffer much privation and misery there. The sufferings  of the Brahmanas might overpower even the gods. That they would  overwhelm me is too certain. Therefore, O Brahmana, go ye back  whithersoever ye list!'    \"The Brahmanas replied, 'O king, our path is even that on which ye are  for setting out! It behoveth thee not, therefore, to forsake us who are  thy devoted admirers practising the true religion! The very gods have  compassion upon their worshippers,--specially upon Brahmanas of  regulated lives!'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Ye regenerate ones, I too am devoted to the  Brahmanas! But this destitution that hath overtaken me overwhelmed me  with confusion! These my brothers that are to procure fruits and roots  and the deer (of the forest) are stupefied with grief arising from their  afflictions and on account of the distress of Draupadi and the loss of  our kingdom! Alas, as they are distressed, I cannot employ them in  painful tasks!'    \"The Brahmanas said, 'Let no anxiety, O king, in respect of our  maintenance, find a place in thy heart! Ourselves providing our own  food, we shall follow thee, and by meditation and saying our prayers we  shall compass thy welfare while by pleasant converse we shall entertain  thee and be cheered ourselves.'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, it must be as ye say, for I am ever  pleased with the company of the regenerate ones! But my fallen condition  maketh me behold in myself an object of reproach! How shall I behold you  all, that do not deserve to bear trouble, out of love for me painfully  subsisting upon food procured by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: _Radha and Krishna in the Grove_ Kangra  (Punjab Hills), c. 1785]          THE LOVES OF KRISHNA    IN INDIAN PAINTING  AND POETRY        By  W.

Unlike Mughal art, it was a product of Hindu courts in  Rajasthan and the Punjab Hills and unlike Mughal painting, its chief  concern was with the varied phases of romance. Ladies would be shown  brooding in their chambers as storm clouds mounted in the sky. A girl  might be portrayed desperately fondling a plantain tree, gripping a pet  falcon, the symbol of her lover, or hurrying through the rainy darkness  intent only on reaching a longed-for tryst. A prince would appear lying on  a terrace, his outstretched arms striving vainly to detain a calm beauty  or welcoming with delight a bashful girl as she slowly advanced. In all  these pictures, romantic love was treated as the highest good and physical  passion was interpreted with a freshness and innocence unequalled in the  world's art.    Such paintings were, at first sight, easy to appreciate. Although they  alternated between two methods of expression--the first a style of savage  distortion, the second a style of the softest grace--each manner enlivened  the common subject.[1] Yet in two respects elucidation was vitally  necessary. Just as in Japan, the lover might express his longings by  cryptic references to Nature, the Indian artist employed poetic symbols to  charge his subjects with romantic ardour. Flowers were never merely  flowers nor clouds clouds. The symbols of Indian poetry--the lotus swaying  in a stream, the flowering creeper embracing a trunk--were intended to  suggest passion-haunted ladies. The mingling of clouds, rain and lightning  symbolized the embraces of lovers, and commonplace objects such as dishes,  vases, ewers and lamps were brought into subtle conjunction to hint at  'the right true end of love.' What, in fact, might seem at first sight to  be a simple portrait, proved on closer understanding to be a study in  despair, a revelation of delight or a clue to rapture, each image with its  sexual implications contriving to express some nuance of longing. In these  pictures, only a part of the meaning was apparent and without a  comprehension of the poetry, much of its true significance was lost.    Such an obstacle to understanding was real enough but, as the eye ranged  over this new kind of love-painting, a second difficulty appeared. In many  pictures, the lover had special characteristics. He was shown with a crown  of peacock's feathers, clad in a golden _dhoti_ and in every case his skin  was mauve or slate-blue.[2] In certain cases, the lady of his choice  appeared bowing at his feet, her pose suggesting the deepest adoration;  yet, in other pictures, his role was quite different. He was then a  resolute warrior, fighting and destroying demons. It was clear, in fact,  that here was no ordinary lover but one who might also be a god. At the  same time, other perplexing circumstances were present. The lover's  appearance was that of an aristocratic youth and the ladies whom he loved  had the bearing of elegant princesses. Yet often the scene of their  encounters was a forest thick with flowering trees. His companions were  cowherds and the objects of his love were not the ladies of a court but  cowgirls. Other activities betrayed the same lowly sphere. In certain  pictures, he was shown eating with cowherds, sharing in their sports,  grazing the cattle and himself milking cows. That such a lover should  dominate the paintings was perplexing in the extreme and just as cultured  Indians would be baffled by Italian and Flemish painting unless they  already knew the life of Christ, it was clear that part, even the  majority, of these pictures would remain obscure unless the character of  their central figure was first explained. One further point remained. In  many cases, the pictures were not intended to be viewed in isolation but  were illustrations of a text. Many were inscribed with Sanskrit or Hindi  verses and in each case there was an intimate connection between the  content of the picture and the poem's subject. To understand the pictures,  therefore, some acquaintance with these texts was necessary for only in  this way could the identity and role of the blue-skinned lover be  appreciated. He was, in fact, Krishna--an incarnation of God--and in his  worship some of the deepest requirements of the Indian spirit found  ecstatic release.    The purpose of this book is to throw some light on Indian painting by  presenting the story of Krishna in the clearest possible terms. It might  be supposed that, of all Indian gods, Krishna was already the one best  known to the West and therefore, perhaps, the one least requiring  explanation. Among modern poets, Sacheverell Sitwell devotes a whole poem  in _Canons of Giant Art_ to describing Krishna's effect.      Rain falls and ceases, all the forest trembles:    Mystery walks the woods once more,    We hear a flute.    It moves on earth, it is the god who plays    With the flute to his lips and music in his breath:    The god is Krishna in his lovely youth.    Louis MacNeice in _Ten Burnt Offerings_ describes a much-loved cat,      Fluid as Krishna chasing the milkmaids.    And the same Krishna, flute player and lover of milkmaids, is familiar to  British audiences from the dancing of Ram Gopal. Yet side by side with  this magnetic figure, a second, strangely different Krishna is also known.  This second Krishna is the preacher of the _Bhagavad Gita_, the great  sermon delivered on the battle-field of Kurukshetra. It is a cardinal  document of Indian ethics, and consoled Mahatma Gandhi during his work for  Indian independence. It has for many years been known in the West but has  recently attracted fresh attention through a modern translation by  Christopher Isherwood and Swami Prabhavananda. This Krishna of the _Gita_  is clearly quite different in character from the Krishna of the milkmaids  and, without some effort at reconciliation, the two must obviously present  a baffling enigma. Indeed so great is the contrast that many Englishmen,  entranced by the lover, might be astonished to hear of a more didactic  role, while those who value the _Gita_ might easily be disturbed on  finding its author so daringly identified with the theory and practice of  romantic love. The truth, if we are to admit it, is that despite  considerable acquaintance with Krishna as a name, few educated people in  the West have intimate knowledge of his story. In fact, we have only to  ask some basic questions to realize how slender is general understanding.  What, for example, were the circumstances in which Krishna was born and  why did he enter the world? Of which Indian god is he an incarnation? Who  were his parents and how did he come to live among cowherds? Who were  Radha and Rukmini? In what ways did he love the milkmaids and why has this  aspect of his story assumed such big proportions in Indian religion? Why,  in fact, is God a romantic lover? Just as few Indians, even highly  educated Indians, could survive a friendly cross-examination on details of  the New Testament, the majority of cultured Englishmen would find it hard  to answer even a few of these simple questions.    It is to remedy in part this situation that I have marshalled the material  given in this book. With certain types of issue I have made no attempt to  deal. I have not, for example, discussed statements such as 'Krishna was  not a god but a hero of a rough tribe of cowherds.' 'The Gita is an  interpolation.' 'There is general agreement on the historicity of  Krishna.' 'Radha appears to be a late addition.' Higher Criticism, whether  applied to the Bible or to the classics of Indian religion must  necessarily remain a small scholars' preserve--of vital importance to the  few but of little account to the main body of believers or to artists  illustrating adored themes. I have rather been concerned"]]]
