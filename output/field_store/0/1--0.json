The Pursuit of Fire          THERE'S PIPPINS AND CHEESE TO COME          There's Pippins and Cheese To Come      In my noonday quest for food, if the day is fine, it is my habit to shun  the nearer places of refreshment. I take the air and stretch myself. Like  Eve's serpent I go upright for a bit. Yet if time presses, there may be had  next door a not unsavory stowage. A drinking bar is nearest to the street  where its polished brasses catch the eye. It holds a gilded mirror to such  red-faced nature as consorts within. Yet you pass the bar and come upon a  range of tables at the rear.    Now, if you yield to the habits of the place you order a rump of meat.  Gravy lies about it like a moat around a castle, and if there is in you the  zest for encounter, you attack it above these murky waters. \"This castle  hath a pleasant seat,\" you cry, and charge upon it with pike advanced. But  if your appetite is one to peck and mince, the whiffs that breathe upon the  place come unwelcome to your nostrils. In no wise are they like the sweet  South upon your senses. There is even a suspicion in you--such is your  distemper--that it is too much a witch's cauldron in the kitchen, \"eye of  newt, and toe of frog,\" and you spy and poke upon your food. Bus boys bear  off the crockery as though they were apprenticed to a juggler and were only  at the beginning of their art. Waiters bawl strange messages to the cook.  It's a tongue unguessed by learning, yet sharp and potent. Also, there  comes a riot from the kitchen, and steam issues from the door as though the  devil himself were a partner and conducted here an upper branch. Like the  man in the old comedy, your belly may still ring dinner, but the tinkle is  faint. Such being your state, you choose a daintier place to eat.    Having now set upon a longer journey--the day being fine and the sidewalks  thronged--you pass by a restaurant that is but a few doors up the street.  A fellow in a white coat flops pancakes in the window. But even though the  pancake does a double somersault and there are twenty curious noses pressed  against the glass, still you keep your course uptown.    Nor are you led off because a near-by stairway beckons you to a Chinese  restaurant up above. A golden dragon swings over the door. Its race has  fallen since its fire-breathing grandsire guarded the fruits of the  Hesperides. Are not \"soys\" and \"chou meins\" and other such treasures of the  East laid out above? And yet the dragon dozes at its post like a sleepy  dog. No flame leaps up its gullet. The swish of its tail is stilled. If it  wag at all, it's but in friendship or because a gust of wind has stirred it  from its dreams.    I have wondered why Chinese restaurants are generally on the second story.  A casual inquiry attests it. I know of one, it is true, on the ground  level, yet here I suspect a special economy. The place had formerly been a  German restaurant, with Teuton scrolls, \"Ich Dien,\" and heraldries on its  walls. A frugal brush changed the decoration. From the heart of a Prussian  blazonry, there flares on you in Chinese yellow a recommendation to try  \"Our Chicken Chop Soy.\" The quartering of the House of Hohenzollern wears a  baldric in praise of \"Subgum Noodle Warmein,\" which it seems they cook to  an unusual delicacy. Even a wall painting of Rip Van Winkle bowling at  tenpins in the mountains is now set off with a pigtail. But the chairs were  Dutch and remain as such. Generally, however, Chinese restaurants are on  the second story. Probably there is a ritual from the ancient days of Ming  Ti that Chinamen when they eat shall sit as near as possible to the sacred  moon.    But hold a bit! In your haste up town to find a place to eat, you are  missing some of the finer sights upon the way. In these windows that  you pass, the merchants have set their choicest wares. If there is any  commodity of softer gloss than common, or one shinier to the eye--so  that your poverty frets you--it is displayed here. In the window of the  haberdasher, shirts--mere torsos with not a leg below or head above--yet  disport themselves in gay neckwear. Despite their dismemberment they are  tricked to the latest turn of fashion. Can vanity survive such general  amputation? Then there is hope for immortality.    But by what sad chance have these blithe fellows been disjointed? If  a gloomy mood prevails in you--as might come from a bad turn of the  market--you fancy that the evil daughter of Herodias still lives around the  corner, and that she has set out her victims to the general view. If there  comes a hurdy-gurdy on the street and you cock your ear to the tune of  it, you may still hear the dancing measure of her wicked feet. Or it is  possible that these are the kindred of Holofernes and that they have supped  guiltily in their tents with a sisterhood of Judiths.    Or we may conceive--our thoughts running now to food--that these gamesome  creatures of the haberdasher had dressed themselves for a more recent  banquet. Their black-tailed coats and glossy shirts attest a rare occasion.  It was in holiday mood, when they were fresh-combed and perked in their  best, that they were cut off from life. It would appear that Jack Ketch the  headsman got them when they were rubbed and shining for the feast. We'll  not squint upon his writ. It is enough that they were apprehended for some  rascality. When he came thumping on his dreadful summons, here they were  already set, fopped from shoes to head in the newest whim. Spoon in hand  and bib across their knees--lest they fleck their careful fronts--they  waited for the anchovy to come. And on a sudden they were cut off from  life, unfit, unseasoned for the passage. Like the elder Hamlet's brother,  they were engaged upon an act that had no relish of salvation in it. You  may remember the lamentable child somewhere in Dickens, who because of an  abrupt and distressing accident, had a sandwich in its hand but no mouth  to put it in. Or perhaps you recall the cook of the Nancy Bell and his  grievous end. The poor fellow was stewed in his own stew-pot. It was the  Elderly Naval Man, you recall--the two of them being the ship's sole  survivors on the deserted island, and both of them lean with hunger--it was  the Elderly Naval Man (the villain of the piece) who \"ups with his heels,  and smothers his squeals in the scum of the boiling broth.\"    And yet by looking on these torsos of the haberdasher, one is not brought  to thoughts of sad mortality. Their joy is so exultant. And all the things  that they hold dear--canes, gloves, silk hats, and the newer garments on  which fashion makes its twaddle--are within reach of their armless sleeves.  Had they fingers they would be smoothing themselves before the glass. Their  unbodied heads, wherever they may be, are still smiling on the world,  despite their divorcement. Their tongues are still ready with a jest, their  lips still parted for the anchovy to come.    A few days since, as I was thinking--for so I am pleased to call my muddy  stirrings--what manner of essay I might write and how best to sort and lay  out the rummage, it happened pat to my needs that I received from a friend  a book entitled \"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened.\" Now, before  it came I had got so far as to select a title. Indeed, I had written the  title on seven different sheets of paper, each time in the hope that by  the run of the words I might leap upon some further thought. Seven times I  failed and in the end the sheets went into the waste basket, possibly  to the confusion of Annie our cook, who may have mistaken them for a  reiterated admonishment towards the governance of her kitchen--at the  least, a hint of my desires and appetite for cheese and pippins.    \"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Opened\" is a cook book. It is due you  to know this at once, otherwise your thoughts--if your nature be  vagrant--would drift towards family skeletons. Or maybe the domestic traits  prevail and you would think of dress-clothes hanging in camphorated bags  and a row of winter boots upon a shelf.    I am disqualified to pass upon the merits of a cook book, for the reason  that I have little discrimination in food. It is not that I am totally  indifferent to what lies on the platter. Indeed, I have more than a tribal  aversion to pork in general, while, on the other hand, I quicken joyfully  when noodles are interspersed with bacon. I have a tooth for sweets, too,  although I hold it unmanly and deny it as I can. I am told also--although  I resent it--that my eye lights up on the appearance of a tray of French  pastry. I admit gladly, however, my love of onions, whether they come  hissing from the skillet, or lie in their first tender whiteness. They  are at their best when they are placed on bread and are eaten largely at  midnight after society has done its worst.    A fine dinner is lost within me. A quail is but an inferior chicken--a poor  relation outside the exclusive hennery. Terrapin sits low in my regard,  even though it has wallowed in the most aristocratic marsh. Through such  dinners I hack and saw my way without even gaining a memory of my progress.  If asked the courses, I balk after the recital of the soup.

[Illustration]      The subject of the above engraving claims the attention of the  antiquarian researcher, not as the lofty sculptured mansion of our  monastic progenitors, or the towering castle of the feudatory baton, for  never has the voice of boisterous revelry, or the tones of the solemn  organ, echoed along its vaulted roof; a humbler but not less interesting  trait marks its history. It was here that the zealous pilgrim, strong in  bigot faith, rested his weary limbs, when the inspiring name of Becket  led him from the rustic simplicity of his native home, to view the spot  where Becket fell, and to murmur his pious supplication at the shrine of  the murdered Saint; how often has his toil-worn frame been sheltered  beneath that hospitable roof; imagination can even portray him entering  the area of yon pointed arch, leaning on his slender staff--perhaps some  wanderer from a foreign land.    The hospital of St. Thomas the Martyr of Eastbridge, is situated on the  King's-bridge, in the hundred of Westgate, Canterbury, and was built by  Becket, but for what purpose is unknown. However, after the  assassination of its founder, the resort of individuals being constant  to his shrine, the building was used for the lodgment of the pilgrims.  For many years no especial statutes were enacted, nor any definite rules  laid down for the treatment of pilgrims, till the see devolved to the  jurisdiction of Stratford, who, in 15th Edward III. drew up certain  ordinances, as also a code of regulations expressly to be acted on; he  appointed a master in priest's orders, under whose guidance a secular  chaplain officiated; it was also observed that every pilgrim in health  should have but one night's lodging to the cost of fourpence; that  applicants weak and infirm were to be preferred to those of sounder  constitutions, and that women \"upwards of forty\" should attend to the  bedding, and administer medicines to the sick.    This institution survived the general suppression of monasteries and  buildings of its cast, during the reigns of Henry VIII. and the sixth  Edward; and after alternately grading from the possession of private  families to that of brothers belonging to the establishment, it was at  last finally appropriated to the instruction of the rising generation,  whose parents are exempt from giving any gratuity to the preceptor of  their children.    Its present appearance is ancient, but not possessing any of those magic  features which render the mansions of our majores so grand and  magnificently solemn; a hall and chapel of imposing neatness and  simplicity are still in good condition, but several of the  apartments are dilapidated in part, and during a wet season admit the  aqueous fluid through the chinks and fissures of their venerable walls.    SAGITTARIUS.           *       *       *       *       *        THE LECTURER.           *       *       *       *       *      MINOR AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN.      Pain _in the head_ may arise from very different causes, and is  variously seated. It has had a number of different appellations bestowed  upon it, according to its particular character. I need not observe that  headach is a general attendant of all inflammatory states of the brain,  whether in the form of _phrenitis, hydrocephalus acutus_, or _idiopathic  fever;_ though with some exceptions in regard to all of them, as I  before showed you. It is often also said to be a symptom of other  diseases, of parts remotely situated; as of the _stomach_, more  especially; whence the term _sick headach_, the stomach being supposed  to be the part first or principally affected, and the headach  symptomatic of this. I am confident, however, that in a majority of  instances the reverse is the case, the affection of the head being the  cause of the disorder of the stomach. It is no proof to the contrary,  that _vomiting_ often relieves the headach, for vomiting is capable of  relieving a great number of other diseases, as well as those of the  brain, upon the principle of _counter-irritation_. The stomach may be  disordered by nauseating medicines, up to the degree of full vomiting,  without any headach taking place; but the brain hardly ever suffers,  either from injury or disease, without the stomach having its functions  impaired, or in a greater or less degree disturbed: thus a blow on the  head immediately produces vomiting; and, at the outset of various  inflammatory affections of the brain, as _fever_ and _hydrocephalus_,  nausea and vomiting are almost never-failing symptoms. It is not denied,  that _headach_ may be produced through the medium of the stomach; but  seldom, unless there is previously disease in the head, or at least a  strong predisposition to it. In persons habitually subject to headach,  the arteries of the brain become so irritable, that the slightest cause  of disturbance, either _mental_ or _bodily_, will suffice to bring on a  paroxysm.    The _occasional_ or _exciting causes of headach_, then, are principally  these:--    1. _Emotions of mind_, as fear, terror, and agitation of spirits; yet  these will sometimes take off headach when present at the time.    2. Whatever either increases or disorders the general circulation, and  especially all causes that increase the action of the cerebral arteries,  or, as it is usually though improperly expressed, which occasion a  determination of blood to the head. Of the former kind are violent  exercise, and external heat applied to the surface generally, as by a  heated atmosphere or the _hot bath_; of the latter, the direct  application of heat to the head; falls or blows, occasioning a shock to  the brain; stooping; intense thinking; intoxicating drinks, and other  narcotic substances. These last, however, as well as _mental emotions_,  often relieve a paroxysm of headach, though they favour its return  afterwards.    3. A disordered state of the stomach, of which a vomiting of _bile_ may  be one symptom, is also to be ranked among the _occasional causes_ of  _headach_.    These _occasional causes_ do not in general produce their effect, unless  where a _predisposition_ to the disease exists. This predisposition is  often hereditary, or it may be acquired by long-protracted study and  habits of intoxication.--_Dr. Clutterbuck's Lectures on the Diseases of  the Nervous System_.      HYDROPHOBIA.      There is no cure for this disease when once the symptoms show  themselves. A variety of remedies have from time to time been advertised  by quacks. The \"Ormskirk Medicine,\" at one time, was much in vogue; it  had its day, but it did not cure the disease, nor, as far as I know, did  it mitigate any of its symptoms. With regard to the affection of the  mind itself in this disease, it does not appear that the patients are  deprived of reason; some have merely, by the dint of resolution,  conquered the dread of water, though they never could conquer the  convulsive motions which the contact of liquids occasioned; while this  resolution has been of no avail, for the convulsions and other symptoms  increasing, have almost always destroyed the unhappy sufferers.  --_Abernethy's Lectures_.      EFFECTS OF KINDNESS ON THE SICK.      Under all circumstances, man is a poor and pitiable being, when stricken  down by disease. Sickened and subdued, his very lineaments have a voice  which calls for commiseration and assistance. Celsus says, that knowing  two physicians equally intelligent, he should prefer the one who was his  friend, for the obvious reason that he would feel a deeper interest in  his welfare. Kindness composes, and harshness disturbs the mind, and  each produces correspondent effects upon the body. A tone, a look, may  save or destroy life in extremely delicate cases. Whatever may be the  prognosis given to friends, in all febrile cases, the most confident and  consoling language about the ultimate recovery should be used to the  sick, as prophecies not unfrequently contribute to bring about the event  foretold, by making people feel, or think, or act, differently from what  they otherwise would have done. Again, in chronic cases, as time is  required for their cure, by explaining to the patient this fact, we  maintain his confidence, we keep his mind easy, and thus gain a fair  opportunity for the operation of regimen or remedies; in short, the  judicious physician, like the Roman general, Fabius, conquers through  delay, by cutting off the supplies, and wearing out the strength of the  enemy. In large cities, where the mind is so much overwrought in the  various schemes of private ambition, or of public business, anxiety is  very frequently the grand opposing circumstance to recovery; so that  while the causes which produced it are allowed to operate, mere medical  prescription is of no avail. The effects of this anxiety are visible in  the pallid face and wasted body. But if the patient be possessed of  philosophy enough to forego his harassing pursuits; if he have not, from  the contact and cares of the world, lost his relish for the simple and  sublime scenes of nature, a removal into the country is of the utmost  efficacy. The deformity and conflict of the moral world are exchanged  for the beauty and calm of the physical world; and surrounded by all the  poetry of earth and heaven, the mind regains its peace, and the health,  as if by magic, is perfectly restored.--_Dr. Armstrong's Lectures_.
