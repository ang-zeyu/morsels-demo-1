There is not much in ancient governments and laws to interest us, except  such as were in harmony with natural justice, and were designed for the  welfare of all classes in the State. A jurisprudence founded on the  edicts of absolute kings, or on the regulations of a priestly caste, is  necessarily partial, and may be unenlightened. But those laws which are  gradually enacted for the interests of the whole body of the  people,--for the rich and poor, the powerful and feeble alike,--have  generally been the result of great and diverse experiences, running  through centuries, the work of wise men under constitutional forms of  government. The jurisprudence of nations based on equity is a growth or  development according to public wants and necessities, especially in  countries having popular liberty and rights, as in England and the  United States.    We do not find in the history of ancient nations such a jurisprudence,  except in the free States of Greece and among the Romans, who had a  natural genius or aptitude for government, and where the people had a  powerful influence in legislation, until even the name of liberty was  not invoked.    Among the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians the only laws were the  edicts of kings or the regulations of priests, mostly made with a view  of cementing their own power, except those that were dictated by  benevolence or the pressing needs of the people, who were ground down  and oppressed, and protected only as slaves were once protected in the  Southern States of America. Wise and good monarchs doubtless issued  decrees for the benefit of all classes, such as conscience or knowledge  dictated, whenever they felt their great responsibilities, as in some of  the absolute monarchies of Europe; but they never issued their decrees  at the suggestions or demands of those classes for whom the laws were  made. The voice of the people was ignored, except so far as it moved the  pity or appealed to the hearts and consciences of their rulers; the  people had, and claimed, no _rights_. The only men to whom rulers  listened, or by whom they were controlled, were those whom they chose as  counsellors and ministers, who were supposed to advise with a view to  the sovereign's benefit, and that of the empire generally.    The same may be said in general of other Oriental monarchies,  especially when embarked in aggressive wars, where the will of the  monarch was supreme and unresisted, as in Persia. In India and China the  government was not so absolute, since it was checked by feudatory  princes, almost independent like the feudal barons and dukes of  mediaeval Europe.    Nor was there probably among Oriental nations any elaborate codification  of the decrees and laws as in Greece and Rome, except by the priests for  their ritual service, like that which marked the jurisprudence of the  Israelites.

THE ALCESTIS    OF    EURIPIDES        TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH RHYMING VERSE    WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES BY    GILBERT MURRAY, LL D, D LITT, FBA    REGIUS PROFESSOR OF GREEK IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD          1915        INTRODUCTION    The _Alcestis_ would hardly confirm its author's right to be  acclaimed \"the most tragic of the poets.\" It is doubtful whether one can  call it a tragedy at all. Yet it remains one of the most characteristic  and delightful of Euripidean dramas, as well as, by modern standards, the  most easily actable. And I notice that many judges who display nothing but  a fierce satisfaction in sending other plays of that author to the block  or the treadmill, show a certain human weakness in sentencing the gentle  daughter of Pelias.    The play has been interpreted in many different ways. There is the old  unsophisticated view, well set forth in Paley's preface of 1872. He  regards the _Alcestis_ simply as a triumph of pathos, especially of  \"that peculiar sort of pathos which comes most home to us, with our views  and partialities for domestic life.... As for the characters, that of  Alcestis must be acknowledged to be pre-eminently beautiful. One could  almost imagine that Euripides had not yet conceived that bad opinion of  the sex which so many of the subsequent dramas exhibit.... But the rest  are hardly well-drawn, or, at least, pleasingly portrayed.\" \"The poet  might perhaps, had he pleased, have exhibited Admetus in a more amiable  point of view.\"    This criticism is not very trenchant, but its weakness is due, I think,  more to timidity of statement than to lack of perception. Paley does see  that a character may be \"well-drawn\" without necessarily being \"pleasing\";  and even that he may be eminently pleasing as a part of the play while  very displeasing in himself. He sees that Euripides may have had his own  reasons for not making Admetus an ideal husband. It seems odd that such  points should need mentioning; but Greek drama has always suffered from a  school of critics who approach a play with a greater equipment of  aesthetic theory than of dramatic perception. This is the characteristic  defect of classicism. One mark of the school is to demand from dramatists  heroes and heroines which shall satisfy its own ideals; and, though there  was in the New Comedy a mask known to Pollux as \"The Entirely-good Young  Man\" ([Greek: panchraestos neaniskos]), such a character is fortunately  unknown to classical Greek drama.    The influence of this \"classicist\" tradition has led to a timid and  unsatisfying treatment of the _Alcestis_, in which many of the most  striking and unconventional features of the whole composition were either  ignored or smoothed away. As a natural result, various lively-minded  readers proceeded to overemphasize these particular features, and were  carried into eccentricity or paradox. Alfred Schoene, for instance, fixing  his attention on just those points which the conventional critic passed  over, decides simply that the _Alcestis_ is a parody, and finds it  very funny. (_Die Alkestis von Euripides_, Kiel, 1895.)    I will not dwell on other criticisms of this type. There are those who  have taken the play for a criticism of contemporary politics or the  current law of inheritance. Above all there is the late Dr. Verrall's  famous essay in _Euripides the Rationalist_, explaining it as a  psychological criticism of a supposed Delphic miracle, and arguing that  Alcestis in the play does not rise from the dead at all. She had never  really died; she only had a sort of nervous catalepsy induced by all the  \"suggestion\" of death by which she was surrounded. Now Dr. Verrall's work,  as always, stands apart. Even if wrong, it has its own excellence, its  special insight and its extraordinary awakening power. But in general the  effect of reading many criticisms on the _Alcestis_ is to make a  scholar realize that, for all the seeming simplicity of the play,  competent Grecians have been strangely bewildered by it, and that after  all there is no great reason to suppose that he himself is more sensible  than his neighbours.    This is depressing. None the less I cannot really believe that, if we make  patient use of our available knowledge, the _Alcestis_ presents any  startling enigma. In the first place, it has long been known from the  remnants of the ancient Didascalia, or official notice of production, that  the _Alcestis_ was produced as the fourth play of a series; that is,  it took the place of a Satyr-play. It is what we may call Pro-satyric.  (See the present writer's introduction to the _Rhesus_.) And we  should note for what it is worth the observation in the ancient Greek  argument: \"The play is somewhat satyr-like ([Greek: saturiphkoteron]). It  ends in rejoicing and gladness against the tragic convention.\"    Now we are of late years beginning to understand much better what a  Satyr-play was. Satyrs have, of course, nothing to do with satire, either  etymologically or otherwise. Satyrs are the attendant daemons who form the  Komos, or revel rout, of Dionysus. They are represented in divers  fantastic forms, the human or divine being mixed with that of some animal,  especially the horse or wild goat. Like Dionysus himself, they are  connected in ancient religion with the Renewal of the Earth in spring and  the resurrection of the dead, a point which students of the  _Alcestis_ may well remember. But in general they represent mere  joyous creatures of nature, unthwarted by law and unchecked by  self-control. Two notes are especially struck by them: the passions and  the absurdity of half-drunken revellers, and the joy and mystery of the  wild things in the forest.    The rule was that after three tragedies proper there came a play, still in  tragic diction, with a traditional saga plot and heroic characters, in  which the Chorus was formed by these Satyrs. There was a deliberate clash,  an effect of burlesque; but of course the clash must not be too brutal.  Certain characters of the heroic saga are, so to speak, at home with  Satyrs and others are not. To take our extant specimens of Satyr-plays,  for instance: in the _Cyclops_ we have Odysseus, the heroic  trickster; in the fragmentary _Ichneutae_ of Sophocles we have the  Nymph Cyllene, hiding the baby Hermes from the chorus by the most  barefaced and pleasant lying; later no doubt there was an entrance of the  infant thief himself. Autolycus, Sisyphus, Thersites are all Satyr-play  heroes and congenial to the Satyr atmosphere; but the most congenial of  all, the one hero who existed always in an atmosphere of Satyrs and the  Komos until Euripides made him the central figure of a tragedy, was  Heracles.  [Footnote: The character of Heracles in connexion with the Komos, already  indicated by Wilamowitz and Dieterich (_Herakles_, pp. 98, ff.;  _Pulcinella_, pp. 63, ff.), has been illuminatingly developed in an  unpublished monograph by Mr. J.A.K. Thomson, of Aberdeen.]    The complete Satyr-play had a hero of this type and a Chorus of Satyrs.  But the complete type was refined away during the fifth century; and one  stage in the process produced a play with a normal chorus but with one  figure of the Satyric or \"revelling\" type. One might almost say the  \"comic\" type if, for the moment, we may remember that that word is  directly derived from 'Komos.'    The _Alcestis_ is a very clear instance of this Pro-satyric class of  play. It has the regular tragic diction, marked here and there (393,  756, 780, etc.) by slight extravagances and forms of words which are  sometimes epic and sometimes over-colloquial; it has a regular saga plot,  which had already been treated by the old poet Phrynichus in his  _Alcestis_, a play which is now lost but seems to have been Satyric;  and it has one character straight from the Satyr world, the heroic  reveller, Heracles. It is all in keeping that he should arrive tired,  should feast and drink and sing; should be suddenly sobered and should go  forth to battle with Death. It is also in keeping that the contest should  have a half-grotesque and half-ghastly touch, the grapple amid the graves  and the cracking ribs.           *       *       *       *       *    So much for the traditional form. As for the subject, Euripides received  it from Phrynichus, and doubtless from other sources. We cannot be sure of  the exact form of the story in Phrynichus. But apparently it told how  Admetus, King of Pherae in Thessaly, received from Apollo a special  privilege which the God had obtained, in true Satyric style, by making the  Three Fates drunk and cajoling them. This was that, when his appointed  time for death came, he might escape if he could find some volunteer to  die for him. His father and mother, from whom the service might have been  expected, refused to perform it. His wife, Alcestis, though no blood  relation, handsomely undertook it and died. But it so happened that  Admetus had entertained in his house the demi-god, Heracles; and when  Heracles heard what had happened, he went out and wrestled with Death,  conquered him, and brought Alcestis home.    Given this form and this story, the next question is: What did Euripides  make of them? The general answer is clear: he has applied his usual  method. He accepts the story as given in the tradition, and then  represents it in his own way. When the tradition in question is really  heroic, we know what his way is. He preserves, and even emphasizes, the  stateliness and formality of the Attic stage conventions; but, in the  meantime, he has subjected the story and its characters to a keener study  and a more sensitive psychological judgment than the simple things were  originally meant to bear. So that many characters which passed as heroic,  or at least presentable, in the kindly remoteness of legend, reveal some  strange weakness when brought suddenly into the light. When the tradition "]]]
