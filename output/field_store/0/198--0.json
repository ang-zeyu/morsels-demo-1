To  have been the means of administering innocent mirth to thousands, may  surely be a just motive for satisfaction, and an excuse for grateful  expression.    At the same time, I am desirous of adding a few words as to the history of  the two previously published volumes, and more particularly of the first or  original \"Book of Nonsense,\" relating to which many absurd reports have  crept into circulation, such as that it was the composition of the late  Lord Brougham, the late Earl of Derby, etc.; that the rhymes and pictures  are by different persons; or that the whole have a symbolical meaning,  etc.; whereas, every one of the Rhymes was composed by myself, and every  one of the Illustrations drawn by my own hand at the time the verses were  made. Moreover, in no portion of these Nonsense drawings have I ever  allowed any caricature of private or public persons to appear, and  throughout, more care than might be supposed has been given to make the  subjects incapable of misinterpretation: \"Nonsense,\" pure and absolute,  having been my aim throughout.    As for the persistently absurd report of the late Earl of Derby being the  author of the \"First Book of Nonsense,\" I may relate an incident which  occurred to me four summers ago, the first that gave me any insight into  the origin of the rumor.    I was on my way from London to Guildford, in a railway carriage,  containing, besides myself, one passenger, an elderly gentleman: presently,  however, two ladies entered, accompanied by two little boys. These, who had  just had a copy of the \"Book of Nonsense\" given them, were loud in their  delight, and by degrees infected the whole party with their mirth.    \"How grateful,\" said the old gentleman to the two ladies, \"all children,  and parents too, ought to be to the statesman who has given his time to  composing that charming book!\"    (The ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was I, the author.)    \"Do you not know who is the writer of it?\" asked the gentleman.    \"The name is 'Edward Lear,'\" said one of the ladies.    \"Ah!\" said the first speaker, \"so it is printed; but that is only a whim of  the real author, the Earl of Derby. 'Edward' is his Christian name, and, as  you may see, LEAR is only EARL transposed.\"    \"But,\" said the lady, doubtingly, \"here is a dedication to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of Edward, thirteenth  Earl of Derby, by the author, Edward Lear.\"    \"That,\" replied the other, \"is simply a piece of mystification; I am in a  position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord  Derby himself. In fact, there is no such a person at all as Edward Lear.\"    \"Yet,\" said the other lady, \"some friends of mine tell me they know Mr.  Lear.\"    \"Quite a mistake! completely a mistake!\" said the old gentleman, becoming  rather angry at the contradiction; \"I am well aware of what I am saying: I  can inform you, no such a person as 'Edward Lear' exists!\"    Hitherto I had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief  and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as I happened to have in  my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to  resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be  extinguisher's attention, I speedily reduced him to silence.    The second volume of Nonsense, commencing with the verses, \"The Owl and the  Pussy-Cat,\" was written at different times, and for different sets of  children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then  illustrated, and published in a single volume, by Mr. R.J. Bush, of 32  Charing Cross.    The contents of the third or present volume were made also at different  intervals in the last two years.    Long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house,  where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, \"There was an old  man of Tobago,\" were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse  lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and  thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the  first \"Book of Nonsense\" were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever  having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome  at the appearance of every new absurdity.    Most of these Drawings and Rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones  in the year 1846, and were then first published by Mr. Thomas McLean, of  the Haymarket. But that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call  for the \"Book of Nonsense\" continuing, I added a considerable number of  subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be  carefully reproduced in woodcuts by Messrs. Dalzell, I disposed of the  copyright to Messrs. Routledge and Warne, by whom the volume was published  in 1843.                                                                EDWARD LEAR.

Some think him ill-tempered and queer,          But a few think him pleasant enough.

He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,          Leastways if you reckon two thumbs;        Long ago he was one of the singers,          But now he is one of the dumbs.          He sits in a beautiful parlor,          With hundreds of books on the wall;        He drinks a great deal of Marsala,          But never gets tipsy at all.          He has many friends, lay men and clerical,          Old Foss is the name of his cat;        His body is perfectly spherical,          He weareth a runcible hat.          When he walks in waterproof white,          The children run after him so!        Calling out, \"He's come out in his night-          Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!\"          He weeps by the side of the ocean,          He weeps on the top of the hill;        He purchases pancakes and lotion,          And chocolate shrimps from the mill.          He reads, but he cannot speak, Spanish,          He cannot abide ginger beer:        Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,          How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!           *        *        *        *        *          INTRODUCTION.    Edward Lear, the artist, Author of \"Journals of a Landscape Painter\" in  various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful \"Books of  Nonsense,\" which have amused successive generations of children, died on  Sunday, January 29, 1888, at San Remo, Italy, where he had lived for twenty  years. Few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their  appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he  was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance,  and popular wherever he was known. Fewer still could call up in the minds  of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for  personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was  impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. London, Rome, the  Mediterranean countries generally, Ceylon and India, are still all dotted  with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately,  although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. He  was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic,  given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes  bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after  truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of  consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to  extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes  or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not  without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability  to which such temperaments are liable.    Great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, Lear hardly succeeded  in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. His work was  frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for  the Academy or other exhibitions. His larger and more highly finished  landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold  in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others  literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or  peculiar scenery. In later years he used in conversation to qualify himself  as a \"topographical artist;\" and the definition was true, though not  exhaustive. He had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the  character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky  gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or  sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle  distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various  lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. Some of his pictures  show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of  painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away  from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. Sir  Roderick Murchison used to say that he always understood the geological  peculiarities of a country he had only studied in Lear's sketches. The  compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter  to whom it could honestly be paid.    The history of Lear's choice of a career was a curious one. He was the  youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was  thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very  early age. As a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement,  and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural  history. It occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account;  and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the  older among us remember as having been called Oriental tinting, took them  to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. The kindness of friends, to  whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and  more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zooelogical  draughtsman. Many of the birds in the earlier volumes of Gould's  magnificent folios were drawn for him by Lear. A few years back there were  eagles alive in the Zooelogical Gardens in Regent's Park to which Lear could  point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to  beak fifty years before. He united with this kind of work the more  unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in  hospitals. One day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in  the Zooelogical Gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder,  entered into conversation, and finally said to him, \"You must come and draw  my birds at Knowsley.\" Lear did not know where Knowsley was, or what it  meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth Earl of Derby. The  successive Earls of Derby have been among Lear's kindest and most generous  patrons. He went to Knowsley, and the drawings in the \"Knowsley Menagerie\"  (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by Lear's  hand. At Knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he  composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of  utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. Lear had already begun seriously  to study landscape. When English winters began to threaten his health, Lord  Derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to Rome as a student  and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among Anglo-Roman  society which laid the foundations of a numerous _clientele_. It was in the  Roman summers that Lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial  wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious  note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate  drawings; and his first volume of \"Illustrated Excursions in Italy,\"  published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his Knowsley patron.    Only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade  he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. It was not  everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious  not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his  garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that  he was careless of comfort and health. Calabria, Sicily, the Desert of  Sinai, Egypt and Nubia, Greece and Albania, Palestine, Syria, Athos,  Candia, Montenegro, Zagori (who knows now where Zagori is, or was?), were  as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities  of Malta, Corsica, and Corfu.
