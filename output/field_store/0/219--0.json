A NARRATIVE OF    SUBTERRANEAN EXPLORATION.          BY THE    REV. G.F. BROWNE, M.A.      FELLOW AND ASSISTANT TUTOR OF ST. CATHARINE'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE;    MEMBER OF THE ALPINE CLUB.        1865.          PREFACE.      The existence of natural ice-caves at depths varying from 50 to 200 feet  below the surface of the earth, unconnected with glaciers or snow  mountains, and in latitudes and at altitudes where ice could not under  ordinary circumstances be supposed to exist, has attracted some  attention on the Continent; but little or nothing seems to be  practically known in England on the subject. These caves are so  singular, and many of them so well repay inspection, that a description  of the twelve which I have visited can scarcely, as it seems to me, be  considered an uncalled-for addition to the numerous books of travel  which are constantly appearing. In order to prevent my narrative from  being a mere dry record of natural phenomena, I have interspersed it  with such incidents of travel as may be interesting in themselves or  useful to those who are inclined to follow my steps. I have also given,  from various sources, accounts of similar caves in different parts of  the world.    A pamphlet on _Glacieres Naturelles_ by M. Thury, of Geneva, of the  existence of which I was not aware when I commenced my explorations, has  been of great service to me. M. Thury had only visited three glacieres  when he published his pamphlet in 1861, but the observations he records  are very valuable. He had attempted to visit a fourth, when,  unfortunately, the want of a ladder of sufficient length stopped him.    I was allowed to read Papers before the British Association at Bath  (1864), in the Chemical Section, on the prismatic formation of the ice  in these caves, and in the Geological Section, on their general  character and the possible causes of their existence.    It is necessary to say, with regard to the sections given in this book,  that, while the proportions of the masses of ice are in accordance with  measurements taken on the spot, the interior height of many of the  caves, and the curves of the roof and sides, are put in with a free  hand, some of them from memory. And of the measurements, too, it is only  fair to say that they were taken for the most part under very  unfavourable circumstances, in dark caves lighted by one, or sometimes  by two candles, with a temperature varying from slightly above to  slightly below the freezing-point, and with no surer foot-hold than that  afforded by slippery slopes of ice and chaotic blocks of stone. In all  cases, errors are due to want of skill, not of honesty; and I hope that  they do not generally lie on the side of exaggeration.    CAMBRIDGE: _June_ 1865.            CONTENTS.      CHAPTER I.

THE GLACIERE OF LA GENOLLIERE, IN THE JURA.      In the summer of 1861, I found myself, with some members of my family,  in a small rustic _pension_ in the village of Arzier, one of the highest  villages of the pleasant slope by which the Jura passes down to the Lake  of Geneva. The son of the house was an intelligent man, with a good  knowledge of the natural curiosities which abound in that remarkable  range of hills, and under his guidance we saw many strange things. More  than once, he spoke of the existence of a _glaciere_ at no great  distance, and talked of taking us to see it; but we were sceptical on  the subject, imagining that _glaciere_ was his patois for _glacier_, and  knowing that anything of the glacier kind was out of the question. At  last, however, on a hot day in August, we set off with him, armed, at  his request, with candles; and, after two or three hours of pine  forests, and grass glades, and imaginary paths up rocky ranges of hill  towards the summits of the Jura, we came to a deep natural pit, down the  side of which we scrambled. At the bottom, after penetrating a few yards  into a chasm in the rock, we discovered a small low cave, perfectly  dark, with a flooring of ice, and a pillar of the same material in the  form of a headless woman, one of whose shoulders we eventually carried  off, to regale our parched friends at Arzier. We lighted up the cave  with candles, and sat crouched on the ice drinking our wine, finding  water, which served the double purpose of icing and diluting the wine,  in small basins in the floor of ice, formed apparently by drops falling  from the roof of the cave.    A few days after, our guide and companion took us to an ice-cavern on a  larger scale, which, we were told, supplies Geneva with ice when the  ordinary stores of that town fail; and the next year my sisters went to  yet another, where, however, they did not reach the ice, as the ladder  necessary for the final drop was not forthcoming.    In the course of the last year or two, I have mentioned these glacieres  now and then in England, and no one has seemed to know anything about  them; so I determined, in the spring of 1864, to spend a part of the  summer in examining the three we had already seen or heard of, and  discovering, if possible, the existence of similar caves.    The first that came under my notice was the Glaciere of La Genolliere;  and, though it is smaller and less interesting than most of those which  I afterwards visited, many of its general features are merely reproduced  on a larger scale in them. I shall therefore commence with this cave,  and proceed with the account of my explorations in their natural order.  It is probable that some of the earlier details may seem to be somewhat  tedious, but they are necessary for a proper understanding of the  subject.    La Genolliere is the _montagne_, or mountain pasturage and wood,  belonging to the village of Genollier, an ancient priory of the monks of  S. Claude.[1] The cave itself lies at no great distance from Arzier--a  village which may be seen in profile from the Grand Quai of Geneva,  ambitiously climbing towards the summit of the last slope of the Jura.  To reach the cave from Geneva, it would be necessary to take train or  steamer to Nyon, whence an early omnibus runs to S. Cergues, if crawling  up the serpentine road can be called running; and from S. Cergues a  guide must be taken across the Fruitiere de Nyon, if anyone can be found  who knows the way. From Arzier, however, which is nine miles up from  Nyon, it was not necessary to take the S. Cergues route; and we went  straight through the woods, past the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14015"],[0,"The Discovery of Witches (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's note: In Quer. 11, point 3, 'confession of a With'                      corrected to 'confession of a Witch'.

THE DISCOVERY OF WITCHES    IN Answer to severall QUERIES, LATELY Delivered to the Judges of  Assize for the County of NORFOLK    And now published by    MATTHEW HOPKINS, Witch-finder    FOR the Benefit of the whole KINGDOME    M. DC. XLVII.                       EXOD. 22.18.           Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.                  Certaine _Queries_ answered, which have been and are likely to      be objected against MATTHEW HOPKINS, in his way of finding out      _Witches_.        Querie 1.        _That he must needs be the greatest Witch, Sorcerer, and Wizzard      himselfe, else hee could not doe it._      Answ.    If _Satan's_ kingdome be divided against it selfe, how shall it stand?        Querie 2.        _If he never went so farre as is before mentioned, yet for      certaine he met with the Devill, and cheated him of his Booke,      wherein were written all the Witches names in_ England, _and if      he looks on any Witch, he can tell by her countenance what she      is; so by this, his helpe is from the Devill._      Answ.    If he had been too hard for the devill and got his book, it had been  to his great commendation, and no disgrace at all: and for judgement  in _Phisiognomie_, he hath no more then any man else whatsoever.        Quer. 3.        _From whence then proceeded this his skill? was it from his      profound learning, or from much reading of learned Authors      concerning that subject?_      Answ.    From neither of both, but from experience, which though it be meanly  esteemed of, yet the surest and safest way to judge by.        Quer. 4.        _I pray where was this experience gained? and why gained by him      and not by others?_        Answ.    The Discoverer never travelled far for it, but in _March_ 1644 he had  some seven or eight of that horrible sect of Witches living in the  Towne where he lived, a Towne in Essex called _Maningtree_, with  divers other adjacent Witches of other towns, who every six weeks in  the night (being alwayes on the Friday night) had their meeting close  by his house and had their severall solemne sacrifices there offered  to the _Devill_, one of which this discoverer heard speaking to her  _Imps_ one night, and bid them goe to another Witch, who was thereupon  apprehended, and searched, by women who had for many yeares knowne the  Devills marks, and found to have three teats about her, which honest  women have not: so upon command from the _Justice_ they were to keep  her from sleep two or three nights, expecting in that time to see her  _familiars_, which the fourth night she called in by their severall  names, and told them what shapes, a quarter of an houre before they  came in, there being ten of us in the roome, the first she called was    1. _Holt_, who came in like a white kitling.    2. _Jarmara_, who came in like a fat Spaniel without any legs at all,  she said she kept him fat, for she clapt her hand on her belly and  said he suckt good blood from her body.    3. _Vinegar Tom_, who was like a long-legg'd Greyhound, with an head  like an Oxe, with a long taile and broad eyes, who when this  discoverer spoke to, and bade him goe to the place provided for him  and his Angels, immediately transformed himselfe into the shape of a  child of foure yeeres old without a head, and gave halfe a dozen  turnes about the house, and vanished at the doore.    4. _Sack and Sugar_, like a black Rabbet.    5. _Newes_, like a Polcat. All these vanished away in a little time.  Immediately after this Witch confessed severall other Witches, from  whom she had her _Imps_, and named to divers women where their marks  were, the number of their _Marks_, and _Imps_, and _Imps_ names, as  _Elemanzer_, _Pyewacket_, _Peckin the Crown_, _Grizzel_, _Greedigut_,  _&c._ which no mortall could invent; and upon their searches the same  Markes were found, the same number, and in the same place, and the  like confessions from them of the same Imps, (though they knew not  that we were told before) and so peached one another thereabouts that  joyned together in the like damnable practise that in our Hundred in  _Essex_, 29. were condemned at once, 4. brought 25. Miles to be  hanged, where this Discoverer lives, for sending the Devill like a  Beare to kill him in his garden, so by seeing diverse of the mens  Papps, and trying wayes with hundreds of them, he gained this  experience, and for ought he knowes any man else may find them as  well as he and his company, if they had the same skill and experience.        Quer. 5.        _Many poore People are condemned for having a Pap, or Teat about      them, whereas many People (especially antient People) are, and      have been a long time troubled with naturall wretts on severall      parts of their bodies and other naturall excressencies, as      Hemerodes, Piles, Childbearing, &c. and these shall be judged      only by one man alone and a woman, and so accused or acquitted._      Answ.    The parties so judging can justifie their skill to any, and shew good  reasons why such markes are not meerly naturall, neither that they can  happen by any such naturall cause as is before expressed, and for  further answer for their private judgements alone, it is most false  and untrue, for never was any man tryed by search of his body, but  commonly a dozen of the ablest men in the parish or else where, were  present, and most commonly as many ancient skilfull matrons and  midwives present when the women are tryed, which marks not only he,  and his company attest to be very suspitious, but all beholders, the  skilfulest of them, doe not approve of them, but likewise assent that  such tokens cannot in their judgements proceed from any the above  mentioned Causes.        Quer. 6.        _It is a thing impossible for any or woman to judge rightly on      such marks, they are so neare to naturall excressencies and they      that finde them, durst not presently give Oath they were drawne      by evil spirits, till they have used unlawfull courses of      torture to make them say any thing for ease and quiet, as who      would not do? but I would know the reasons he speakes of, how,      and whereby to discover the one from the other, and so be      satisfied in that._      Answ.    The reasons in breefe are three, which for the present he judgeth to  differ from naturall marks which are:    1. He judgeth by the unusualnes of the place where he findeth the  teats in or on their bodies being farre distant from any usuall  place, from whence such naturall markes proceed, as if a witch plead  the markes found are Emerods, if I finde them on the bottome of the  back-bone, shall I assent with him, knowing they are not neere that  veine, and so others by child-bearing, when it may be they are in the  contrary part?    2. They are most commonly insensible, and feele neither pin, needle,  aule, &c. thrust through them.    3. The often variations and mutations of these marks into severall  formes, confirmes the matter; as if a Witch hear a month or two before  that the _Witch-finder_ (as they call him) is comming they will, and  have put out their Imps to others to suckle them, even to their owne  young and tender children; these upon search are found to have dry  skinnes and filmes only, and be close to the flesh, keepe her 24.  houres with a diligent eye, that none of her Spirits come in any  visible shape to suck her; the women have seen the next day after her  Teats extended out to their former filling length, full of corruption  ready to burst, and leaving her alone then one quarter of an houre,  and let the women go up againe and shee will have them drawn by her  Imps close againe: _Probatum est._ Now for answer to their tortures  in its due place.        Quer. 7.        _How can it possibly be that the Devill bring a spirit, and      wants no nutriment or sustentation, should desire to suck any      blood? and indeed as he is a spirit he cannot draw any such      excressences, having neither flesh nor bone, nor can be felt,      &c._      Ans.    He seekes not their bloud, as if he could not subsist without that  nourishment, but he often repairs to them, and gets it, the more to  aggravate the Witches damnation, and to put her in mind of her  _Covenant_; and as he is a Spirit and Prince of the ayre, he appeares  to them in any shape whatsoever, which shape is occasioned by him  through joyning of condensed thickned aire together, and many times  doth assume shapes of many creatures; but to create any thing he  cannot do it, it is only proper to God: But in this case of drawing  out of these Teats, he doth really enter into the body, reall,  corporeall, substantiall creature, and forceth that Creature (he  working in it) to his desired ends, and useth the organs of that body  to speake withall to make his compact up with the Witches, be the  creature Cat, Rat, Mouse, &c.        Quer. 8.        _When these Paps are fully discovered, yet that will not serve      sufficiently to convict them, but they must be tortured and kept      from sleep two or three nights, to distract them, and make them      say any thing; which is a way to tame a wilde Colt, or Hawke,      &c._      Ans.    In the infancy of this discovery it was not only thought fitting, but  enjoyned in _Essex_ and _Suffolke_ by the Magistrates, with this  intention only, because they being kept awake would be more the active  to cal their imps in open view the sooner to their helpe, which  oftentimes have so happened; and never or seldome did any Witch ever  complaine in the time of their keeping for want of rest, but after  they had beat their heads together in the Goale; and after this use  was not allowed of by the judges and other Magistrates, it was never  since used,"]]]
