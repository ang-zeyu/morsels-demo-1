CALVERLEY,    _LATE FELLOW OF CHRIST'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE_.    AUTHOR OF \"FLY LEAVES,\" ETC.    THIRD EDITION.          PREFACE.    I had intended translating all or nearly all these Idylls into blank  verse, as the natural equivalent of Greek or of Latin hexameters; only  deviating into rhyme where occasion seemed to demand it. But I found  that other metres had their special advantages: the fourteen-syllable  line in particular has that, among others, of containing about the same  number of syllables as an ordinary line of Theocritus. And there is also  no doubt something gained by variety.    Several recent writers on the subject have laid down that every  translation of Greek poetry, especially bucolic poetry, must be in rhyme  of some sort. But they have seldom stated, and it is hard to see, why.  There is no rhyme in the original, and _prima facie_ should be none in  the translation. Professor Blackie has, it is true, pointed out the  \"assonances, alliterations, and rhymes,\" which are found in more or less  abundance in Ionic Greek.[A] These may of course be purely accidental,  like the hexameters in Livy or the blank-verse lines in Mr. Dickens's  prose: but accidental or not (it may be said) they are there, and ought  to be recognised. May we not then recognise them by introducing similar  assonances, etc., here and there into the English version? or by  availing ourselves of what Professor Blackie again calls attention to,  the \"compensating powers\"[B] of English? I think with him that it was  hard to speak of our language as one which \"transforms _boos megaloio  boeien_ into 'great ox's hide.'\" Such phrases as 'The Lord is a man of  war,' 'The trumpet spake not to the armed throng,' are to my ear quite  as grand as Homer: and it would be equally fair to ask what we are to  make of a language which transforms Milton's line into [Greek: e  shalpigx ohy proshephe ton hoplismhenon hochlon.][C] But be this as it  may, these phenomena are surely too rare and too arbitrary to be  adequately represented by any regularly recurring rhyme: and the  question remains, what is there in the unrhymed original to which rhyme  answers?    To me its effect is to divide the verse into couplets, triplets, or (if  the word may include them all) _stanzas_ of some kind. Without rhyme we  have no apparent means of conveying the effect of stanzas. There are of  course devices such as repeating a line or part of a line at stated  intervals, as is done in 'Tears, idle tears' and elsewhere: but clearly  none of these would be available to a translator. Where therefore he has  to express stanzas, it is easy to see that rhyme may be admissible and  even necessary. Pope's couplet may (or may not) stand for elegiacs, and  the _In Memoriam_ stanza for some one of Horace's metres. Where the  heroes of Virgil's Eclogues sing alternately four lines each, Gray's  quatrain seems to suggest itself: and where a similar case occurs in  these Idylls (as for instance in the ninth) I thought it might be met by  taking whatever received English stanza was nearest the required length.  Pope's couplet again may possibly best convey the pomposity of some  Idylls and the point of others. And there may be divers considerations  of this kind. But, speaking generally, where the translator has not to  intimate stanzas--where he has on the contrary to intimate that there  are none--rhyme seems at first sight an intrusion and a _suggestio  falsi_.    No doubt (as has been observed) what 'Pastorals' we have are mostly  written in what is called the heroic measure. But the reason is, I  suppose, not far to seek. Dryden and Pope wrote 'heroics,' not from any  sense of their fitness for bucolic poetry, but from a sense of their  universal fitness: and their followers copied them. But probably no  scholar would affirm that any poem, original or translated, by Pope or  Dryden or any of their school, really resembles in any degree the  bucolic poetry of the Greeks. Mr. Morris, whose poems appear to me to  resemble it more almost than anything I have ever seen, of course writes  what is technically Pope's metre, and equally of course is not of Pope's  school. Whether or no Pope and Dryden _intended_ to resemble the old  bucolic poets in style is, to say the least, immaterial. If they did  not, there is no reason whatever why any of us who do should adopt  their metre: if they did and failed, there is every reason why we should  select a different one.    Professor Conington has adduced one cogent argument against blank verse:  that is, that hardly any of us can write it.[D] But if this is so--if  the 'blank verse' which we write is virtually prose in disguise--the  addition of rhyme would only make it rhymed prose, and we should be as  far as ever from \"verse really deserving the name.\"[E] Unless (which I  can hardly imagine) the mere incident of 'terminal consonance' can  constitute that verse which would not be verse independently, this  argument is equally good against attempting verse of any kind: we should  still be writing disguised, and had better write undisguised, prose.  Prose translations are of course tenable, and are (I am told) advocated  by another very eminent critic. These considerations against them occur  to one: that, among the characteristics of his original which the  translator is bound to preserve, one is that he wrote metrically; and  that the prattle which passes muster, and sounds perhaps rather pretty  than otherwise, in metre, would in plain prose be insufferable. Very  likely some exceptional sort of prose may be meant, which would dispose  of all such difficulties: but this would be harder for an ordinary  writer to evolve out of his own brain, than to construct any species of  verse for which he has at least a model and a precedent.    These remarks are made to shew that my metres were not selected, as it  might appear, at hap-hazard. Metre is not so unimportant as to justify  that. For the rest, I have used Briggs's edition[F] (_Poetae Bucolici  Graeci_), and have never, that I am aware of, taken refuge in any various  reading where I could make any sense at all of the text as given by him.  Sometimes I have been content to put down what I felt was a wrong  rendering rather than omit; but only in cases where the original was  plainly corrupt, and all suggested emendations seemed to me hopelessly  wide of the mark. What, for instance, may be the true meaning of  [Greek: bolbhost tist kochlhiast] in the fourteenth Idyll I have no  idea. It is not very important. And no doubt the sense of the last two  lines of the \"_Death of Adonis_\" is very unlikely to be what I have made  it. But no suggestion that I met with seemed to me satisfactory or even  plausible: and in this and a few similar cases I have put down what  suited the context. Occasionally also, as in the Idyll here printed  last--the one lately discovered by Bergk, which I elucidated by the  light of Fritzsche's conjectures--I have availed myself of an opinion  which Professor Conington somewhere expresses, to the effect that, where  two interpretations are tenable, it is lawful to accept for the purposes  of translation the one you might reject as a commentator. [Greek:  tetootaiost] has I dare say nothing whatever to do with 'quartan fever.'    On one point, rather a minor one, I have ventured to dissent from  Professor Blackie and others: namely, in retaining the Greek, instead of  adopting the Roman, nomenclature. Professor Blackie says[G] that there  are some men by whom \"it is esteemed a grave offence to call Jupiter  Jupiter,\" which begs the question: and that Jove \"is much more musical\"  than Zeus, which begs another. Granting (what might be questioned) that  _Zeus, Aphrodite_, and _Eros_ are as absolutely the same individuals  with _Jupiter, Venus_, and _Cupid_ as _Odysseus_ undoubtedly is with  _Ulysses_--still I cannot see why, in making a version of (say)  Theocritus, one should not use by way of preference those names by which  he invariably called them, and which are characteristic of him: why, in  turning a Greek author into English, we should begin by turning all the  proper names into Latin. Professor Blackie's authoritative statement[H]  that \"there are whole idylls in Theocritus which would sound ridiculous  in any other language than that of Tam o' Shanter\" I accept of course  unhesitatingly, and should like to see it acted upon by himself or any  competent person. But a translator is bound to interpret all as best he  may: and an attempt to write Tam o' Shanter's language by one who was  not Tam o' Shanter's countryman would, I fear, result in something more  ridiculous still.

Pontrefact, a place of considerable note in English history, is situated  about two miles south-west from Ferrybridge, nine miles nearly east from  Wakefield, and fifteen miles north-west from Doncaster, in Yorkshire. The  origin of the town is unknown; and the etymology of its name has been a  matter of dispute, in which figures a monkish legend ascribing the name of  Ponsfractus, or Pontefract, to the breaking of a bridge, and the fall of  many persons into the river Aire, who were miraculously saved by St.  William, Archbishop of York. The river Ouse and the city of York, however,  put in a stronger claim as the scene of this miracle, and unfortunately  for Pontefract, the town is so named in charters of fifty-three years'  date before the miracle is pretended to have been performed. Still the  etymology is referable to the breaking down of \"_some bridge_,\" (_pons_,  bridge; _fractus_, broken,) but this unravelment is not antiquarian.  Camden says, that in the Saxon times, the name of this town was Kirkby,  which was changed by the Normans to Pontefract, because of a broken bridge  that was there. But as there is no river within two miles of the place,  this bridge appears to have been built over the Wash, which lies about a  quarter of a mile to the east of the Castle. Other researches prove  Pontefract to have been a secondary and subordinate Roman station.    The history of the Castle is, of course, involved in that of the manor.  The town is stated to have been a burgh in the time of Edward the  Confessor; but how long it had enjoyed this privilege is uncertain.[1]  After the Conquest, this manor, with 150 others, or the greatest part of  so many in Yorkshire, besides ten in Nottinghamshire, and four in  Lincolnshire, were given by William to Hildebert, or Ilbert de Lacy, one  of his Norman followers, who _built the Castle_. The work occupied twelve  years, and it was finished in 1080. The labour and expense of its erection  was so great, that no person unless in the possession of a princely  fortune, could have completed a work of such magnitude. Hildebert was  succeeded by his son Robert, commonly called Robert de Pontefract, from  his being born at that town. Robert enjoyed his vast possessions in peace  during the reign of William Rufus; but after the accession of Henry I. he  with more ambition than prudence, joined with Robert, Duke of Normandy,  the King's brother, who claimed the crown of England. In consequence of  this transaction, Robert de Lacy was banished the realm, and the castle  and honour of Pontefract were given by the King to Henry Traverse, and  afterwards to Henry De-laval.[2] Robert de Lacy was, however, restored  after a few years exile, and the property continued in the Lacy family  till the year 1193, when another Robert de Lacy dying without issue, the  estate and honour of Pontefract devolved on his uterine sister Aubrey de  Lisours, who carried these estates of the Lacys by marriage to Richard  Fitz-Eustace, constable of Chester. Thence they descended to John  Fitz-Eustace, who accompanied Richard I. in his crusade, and is said to  have died at Tyre in Palestine. Roger, his eldest son, also in the crusade,  succeeded to his honour and estates. He was present with Richard at the  memorable siege of Acre. On his return to England he was the first of his  family that took the name of Lacy, in which Pontefract Castle continued  till 1310, when Henry de Lacy, through default of male issue, left his  possessions to his daughter and heiress, Alice, who was married to Thomas,  Earl of Lancaster; and, in case of a failure of issue from that marriage,  he entailed them on the King and his heirs.    The Earl of Lancaster, it will be remembered, became embroiled with Edward  II. and his minion Gaveston, who partly through the interference of  Lancaster, was beheaded at Warwick after a siege in Scarborough Custle.  The King swore vengeance for the death of his favourite, which led this  weak sovereign into a long series of dissentions with the barons, at the  head of whom, was the Earl of Lancaster. Both parties now flew to arms,  but Lancaster soon found himself ill supported by his compeers, and  marching northward for reinforcements from the celebrated Bruce, King of  Scotland, the King in the meantime, sent the Earl of Surrey and Kent to  besiege the castle of Pontefract, which surrendered at the first summons.  Lancaster was next closely pursued by the king with great superiority of  numbers. \"The earl, endeavouring to rally his troops, was taken prisoner,  with ninety-five barons and knights, and carried to the castle of  Pontefract, where he was imprisoned in a tower which Leland says he had  newly made towards the abbey,\" This tower was square: its wall of great  strength, being 10-1/2 feet thick; nor was there any other entrance into  the interior than by a hole or trap-door in the floor of the turret: so  that the prisoner must have been let down into this abode of darkness,  from whence there could be no possible mode of escape; the room was  twenty-five feet square. A few days after, the King being at Pontefract  ordered him to be arraigned in the hall of the castle, before a small  number of peers, among whom were the Spencers, his mortal enemies. The  earl was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; but the punishment  was changed to decapitation. After sentence was passed, he said, \"Shall I  die without answer?\" He was not, however, permitted to speak; but a  certain Gascoign took him away, and having put an old hood over his head,  set him on a lean mare without a bridle. Being attended by a Dominican  friar as his confessor, he was carried out of the town amidst the insults  of the people; and there beheaded. Thus fell Thomas, Earl of Lancaster,  the first Prince of the Blood, being uncle to Edward II. who condemned him  to death. Several of his adherents were hanged at Pontefract.    The next royal blood that stained Pontefract castle was that of King  Richard II. who was here murdered or starved to death; though there is a  tradition that it was merely given out that Richard had starved himself to  death, and that he escaped from Pontefract to Mull, whence he shortly  proceeded to the mainland of Scotland, where, for nineteen years, he was  entertained in an honourable but secret captivity.[3] The matter remains  in tragic darkness.[4] In the succeeding reign of Henry IV. Richard  Scroope, archbishop of York, being taken prisoner, was in Pontefract  castle, condemned to death. Next in the calendar of atrocities committed  within these drear walls, were the murders of Anthony Woodville, Earl  Rivers; Richard, Lord Grey; Sir Thomas Vaughan; and Sir Richard Hawse, in  1483; by Richard III., whom Shakspeare makes to whine forth:        O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison!    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!    Within the guilty closure of thy walls,    Richard II. here was hack'd to death;    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.      We may now pass over matters of minor importance in the history of  Pontefract to the time of Charles I. In the King's contest with his  Parliament, this was the last fortress that held out for the unfortunate  monarch. At Christmas 1644, Sir Thomas Fairfax laid siege to the castle,  and on Jan. 19, following, after an incessant cannonade of three days, a  breach was made: the brave garrison would not surrender; the besiegers  mined, but the besieged counter-mined, and the work of slaughter went on  till the garrison were greatly reduced. At length the Parliamentarians  were attacked and repulsed by a reinforcement of Royalists from Oxford,  and thus ended the first siege of Pontefract. In March, 1645, the enemy  again took possession of the town, and after three months cannonade, the  garrison being reduced almost to a state of famine, surrendered the castle  by an honourable capitulation on June 20. Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed  governor, and he thinking the royal party to be subdued, appointed a  colonel as his substitute, with a garrison of 100 men. The royalists next  by stratagem recovered Pontefract, of which Sir John Digby was appointed  governor.    The third and final siege of this fine castle commenced in October, 1648.  General Rainsborough was appointed to the command of the army, but he  being previously intercepted at Doncaster, Oliver Cromwell undertook to  conduct the siege. After having remained a month before the fortress,  without making any impression on its massy walls, Cromwell joined the  grand army under Fairfax, and General Lambert being appointed commander in  chief of the forces before the castle, arrived at Pontefract on the 4th of  December.    The ENGRAVING represents the castle precisely at this period. It is copied  from a large print taken from a drawing found in the possession of a  descendant of the Fairfax family of Denton; in one angle is the following  memorandum: \"Governor Morris commanded in the Castle. General Lambert  commanded the Siege, being appointed thereto on the death of General  Rainsborough, who was intercepted and killed at Doncaster, by a party from  the Castle, as he was going to take command.\"    General Lambert raised new works, and vigorously pushed the siege; but the  besieged held out. On January 30, 1649, the King was beheaded; and the  news no sooner reached Pontefract, than the royalist garrison proclaimed  his son Charles II. and made a vigorous and destructive sally against  their enemies. The Parliamentarians, however, prevailed, and on March 25,  1649, the garrison being reduced from 500 or 600 to 100 men, surrendered  by capitulation. Six of the principal Royalists were"]]]
