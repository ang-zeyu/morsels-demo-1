Cuneiform and other Scripts          PREFACE      This Handbook is intended primarily for the use of travellers in the  Near and Middle East who are interested in antiquities without being  already trained archaeologists. It is the outcome of a recommendation  made by the Archaeological Joint Committee, a body recently  established, on the initiative of the British Academy and at the  request of the Foreign Office, to focus the knowledge and experience  of British scholars and archaeologists and to place it at the  disposal of the Government when advice or information is needed upon  matters connected with archaeological science. The Committee is  composed of representatives of the principal English societies  connected with Archaeology, and it is hoped that it may be recognized  as the natural body of reference, both for Government Departments and  for the public, on matters connected with archaeological research in  foreign lands. It represents no one institution and no one interest.  Its purpose is to protect the interests of archaeological science, to  secure a sane and enlightened administration of antiquities in the  lands which are now being more fully opened to research, and to  promote the advance of knowledge in the spheres to which its  competence extends.    One means of serving this cause is to provide information for the  guidance of travellers in the lands of antiquity. Much knowledge is  lost because it comes in the way of those who do not know how to  profit by it or to record it. Accordingly, just as the Natural  History Museum has issued a series of pamphlets of advice to the  collectors of natural history specimens, so it has been thought that  a handbook of elementary information and advice may be found of  service by travellers with archaeological tastes; and the Trustees of  the British Museum have undertaken the publication of it. The  handbook has been prepared by a number of persons, whose competence  is beyond dispute; and the thanks of all who find it useful are due  to Mr. G. F. Hill (who has acted as general editor as well as part  author), Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie, Mr. D. G. Hogarth, Prof. J. L.  Myres, Mr. J. G. C. Anderson, Mr. J. P. Droop, Prof. R. A. S.  Macalister, Mr. H. R. Hall, Mr. A. J. B. Wace, Mr. 0. M. Dalton, Mr.  R. L. Hobson, Mr. E. J. Forsdyke, Mr. A. H. Smith, Mr. R. A. Smith,  Mr. A. B. Cook, and Prof. G. A. Cooke. Each contributor has been left  considerable latitude as to the method of treatment of the subject  allotted to him, and no attempt has been made to bring the various  sections into uniformity of pattern. Owing to Prof. Petrie's absence  in Egypt, it has not been possible to submit final proofs of his  contributions to him.    Suggestions for improvement in future editions will be welcomed, and  will no doubt be forthcoming as the result of experience. Meanwhile  it is hoped that this little book will accompany many travellers in  foreign lands, and that the labour expended on it will bear fruit in  the improved observation and record of archaeological data, in  establishing sound principles for the administration of antiquities,  and in enforcing proper methods of excavation and conservation. It  may also be found of service by those who study the results of  research as they appear in museums.    F. G. KENYON.          PART I    CHAPTER I      INTRODUCTORY      The hints which it is the object of this volume to convey are not  meant for experienced archaeologists. They are rather addressed to  those who, while anxious to observe and record the antiquities which  they may see on their travels, are likely, owing to lack of training,  to miss things that may be of importance, or, having observed them,  to bring home an imperfect record. It is hoped also that they may  catch the attention of some of those who are not interested in the  subject, but, coming into possession of antiquities, may unwittingly  do incalculable harm by allowing them to be destroyed or dispersed  before any record has been made.    Most, if not all, of the countries with which we are concerned, have  their Laws of Antiquities. It cannot be too strongly insisted that  those laws, even if they might be better than they are, should be  obeyed by the traveller. He should familiarize himself with their  main provisions, which are summarized in an Appendix. The traveller  who makes it his object to loot a country of its antiquities,  smuggling objects out of it and disguising the sources from which  they are obtained, does a distinct dis-service to archaeological  science. Although he may enrich collections, public or private, half  or more than half of the scientific value of his acquisitions is  destroyed by the fact that their provenance is kept secret or falsely  stated. Such action is equivalent to tearing out whole pages from a  history and destroying them for ever, for each antiquity, whatever it  may be, is in its way a part of history, whether of politics, arts,  or civilization. For the same reason anything like unauthorized  excavation, especially by unskilled hands, is gravely to be  deprecated. To dig an ancient site unskilfully or without keeping a  proper record is to obliterate part of a manuscript which no one else  will ever be able to read. The tendency of recent legislation is to  allow more generous terms in the matter of licences for export to  excavators and collectors, and the harsher provisions of some of the  existing laws are likely soon to be amended.    Before leaving home, the traveller will be well advised to make  inquiries at the museums or at the head-quarters of the  archaeological societies which concern themselves specially with  the places which he intends to visit. A list of these museums and  societies is appended to this section (p. 26). It is hardly necessary  to warn him that archaeological training cannot be acquired in a few  days, and that he will have to buy his experience in various ways;  but the more time he can devote to working through the collections in  this country, the more useful will be his observations abroad. He  will be able to learn what kind of antiquities it is especially  desirable to look for, not merely with the object of filling gaps in  the public collections, but for the advancement of archaeological  knowledge in general.    The object of archaeological travel and excavation is not to collect  antiquities so that they may be arranged according to the existing  catalogues of museums, but to collect fresh information to amplify  and correct what we now know, to make our knowledge of the past more  complete and useful.    On arrival in the country of his choice, he is recommended to  continue at the National Museum the study, which we suppose he has  already begun in the museums at home, of the kind of antiquities  which he is likely to come across. But he should also take an early  opportunity of getting into touch with the local British  Archaeological School or other similar institution, where he will  receive advice what to look for and where and how to look, and  assistance in procuring suitable equipment. Thus the traveller who  starts from Athens or Jerusalem should apply at the British School of  Archaeology. He may there, it he desires, receive instruction in any  of the methods described in Chapter II, in which a little practical  demonstration is worth pages of print, and will be given all possible  assistance in obtaining such articles of equipment as are available  on the spot. (Photographic supplies and all scientific instruments  should be brought out from England.) The best maps of the district  will also be accessible for examination (but the traveller is  recommended to make inquiries in this respect before leaving  England); the libraries will provide the literature dealing with the  routes he proposes to take; and such a collection as the type-series  of pottery and the Finlay collection of prehistoric antiquities at  the British School at Athens may be useful to supplement his previous  studies at museums, and enable him to observe with intelligence the  potsherds, &c., that he may find on an ancient site. In return, he  will be expected to report his results either to the School or to  some other scientific society or museum at home. It should be  unnecessary to remind him that the conditions of the law of the land  relating to the reporting of discoveries to the competent authorities  should be strictly observed."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13579"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team.

ARNOLD]      This is written from an interview with each of the following: George W.  Arnold, Professor W.S. Best of the Lincoln High School and Samuel Bell,  all of Evansville, Indiana.    George W. Arnold was born April 7, 1861, in Bedford County, Tennessee.  He was the property of Oliver P. Arnold, who owned a large farm or  plantation in Bedford county. His mother was a native of Rome, Georgia,  where she remained until twelve years of age, when she was sold at  auction.    Oliver Arnold bought her, and he also purchased her three brothers and  one uncle. The four negroes were taken along with other slaves from  Georgia to Tennessee where they were put to work on the Arnold  plantation.    On this plantation George W. Arnold was born and the child was allowed  to live in a cabin with his relatives and declares that he never heard  one of them speak an unkind word about Master Oliver Arnold or any  member of his family. \"Happiness and contentment and a reasonable amount  of food and clothes seemed to be all we needed,\" said the now  white-haired man.    Only a limited memory of Civil War days is retained by the old man but  the few events recalled are vividly described by him. \"Mother, my young  brother, my sister and I were walking along one day. I don't remember  where we had started but we passed under the fort at Wartrace. A battle  was in progress and a large cannon was fired above us and we watched the  huge ball sail through the air and saw the smoke of the cannon pass over  our heads. We poor children were almost scared to death but our mother  held us close to her and tried to comfort us. The next morning, after,  we were safely at home ... we were proud we had seen that much of the  great battle and our mother told us the war was to give us freedom.\"    \"Did your family rejoice when they were set free?\" was the natural  question to ask Uncle George.    \"I cannot say that they were happy, as it broke up a lot of real  friendships and scattered many families. Mother had a great many pretty  quilts and a lot of bedding. After the negroes were set free, Mars.  Arnold told us we could all go and make ourselves homes, so we started  out, each of the grown persons loaded with great bundles of bedding,  clothing and personal belongings. We walked all the way to Wartrace to  try to find a home and some way to make a living.\"    George W. Arnold remembers seeing many soldiers going to the pike road  on their way to Murfreesboro. \"Long lines of tired men passed through  Guy's Gap on their way to Murfreesboro,\" said he. \"Older people said  that they were sent out to pick up the dead from the battle fields after  the bloody battle of Stone's river that had lately been fought at  Murfreesboro. They took their comrades to bury them at the Union  Cemetery near the town of Murfreesboro.\"    \"Wartrace was a very nice place to make our home. It was located on the  Nashville and Chattanooga and St. Louis railroad, just fifty-one miles  from Nashville not many miles from our old home. Mother found work and  we got along very well but as soon as we children were old enough to  work, she went back to her old home in Georgia where a few years later  she died. I believe she lived to be seventy-five or seventy six years of  age, but I never saw her after she went back to Georgia.\"    \"My first work was done on a farm (there are many fine farms in  Tennessee) and although farm labor was not very profitable we were  always fed wherever we worked and got some wages. Then I got a job on  the railroad. Our car was side tracked at a place called Silver  Springs,\" said Uncle George, \"and right at that place came trouble that  took the happiness out of my life forever.\" Here the story teller paused  to collect his thoughts and conquer the nervous twitching of his lips.  \"It was like this: Three of us boys worked together. We were like three  brothers, always sharing our fortunes with each other. We should never  have done it, but we had made a habit of sending to Nashville after each  payday and having a keg of Holland rum sent in by freight. This liquor  was handed out among our friends and sometimes we drank too much and  were unfit for work for a day or two. Our boss was a big strong  Irishman, red haired and friendly. He always got drunk with us and all  would become sober enough to soon return to our tasks.\"    \"The time I'm telling you about, we had all been invited to a candy  pulling in town and could hardly wait till time to go, as all the young  people of the valley would be there to pull candy, talk, play games and  eat the goodies served to us. The accursed keg of Holland rum had been  brought in that morning and my chum John Sims had been drinking too  much. About that time our Boss came up and said, 'John, it is time for  you to get the supper ready!' John was our cook and our meals were  served on the caboose where we lived wherever we were side tracked.\"    \"All the time Johny was preparing the food he was drinking the rum. When  we went in he had many drinks inside of him and a quart bottle filled to  take to the candy pull. 'Hurry up boys and let's finish up and go' he  said impatiently. 'Don't take him' said the other boy, 'Dont you see he  is drunk?' So I put my arms about his shoulders and tried to tell him he  had better sleep a while before we started. The poor boy was a breed.  His mother was almost white and his father was a thoroughbred Indian and  the son had a most aggravating temper. He made me no answer but running  his hand into his pocket, he drew out his knife and with one thrust, cut  a deep gash in my neck. A terrible fight followed. I remember being  knocked over and my head stricking something. I reached out my hand and  discovered it was the ax. With this awful weapon I struck my friend, my  more than brother. The thud of the ax brought me to my senses as our  blood mingled. We were both almost mortally wounded. The boss came in  and tried to do something for our relief but John said, 'Oh, George?  what an awful thing we have done? We have never said a cross word to  each other and now, look at us both.'\"    \"I watched poor John walk away, darkness was falling but early in the  morning my boss and I followed a trail of blood down by the side of the  tracks. From there he had turned into the woods. We could follow him no  further. We went to all the nearby towns and villages but we found no  person who had ever seen him. We supposed he had died in the woods and  watched for the buzzards, thinking thay would lead us to his body but he  was never seen again.\"    \"For two years I never sat down to look inside a book nor to eat my food  that John Sims was not beside me. He haunted my pillow and went beside  me night and day. His blood was on my hands, his presence haunted me  beyond endurance. What could I do? How could I escape this "]]]
