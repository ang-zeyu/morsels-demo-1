Prescott      \"Congestae cumulantur opes, orbisque rapinas Accipit.\"    Claudian, In Ruf., lib. i., v. 194.      \"So color de religion  Van a buscar plata y oro  Del encubierto tesoro.\"  Lope De Vega, El Nuevo Mundo, Jorn. 1.    Preface    The most brilliant passages in the history of Spanish adventure  in the New World are undoubtedly afforded by the conquests of  Mexico and Peru, - the two states which combined with the largest  extent of empire a refined social polity, and considerable  progress in the arts of civilization.  Indeed, so prominently do  they stand out on the great canvas of history, that the name of  the one, notwithstanding the contrast they exhibit in their  respective institutions, most naturally suggests that of the  other; and, when I sent to Spain to collect materials for an  account of the Conquest of Mexico, I included in my researches  those relating to the Conquest of Peru.    The larger part of the documents, in both cases, was obtained  from the same great repository, - the archives of the Royal  Academy of History at Madrid; a body specially intrusted with the  preservation of whatever may serve to illustrate the Spanish  colonial annals.  The richest portion of its collection is  probably that furnished by the papers of Munoz.  This eminent  scholar, the historiographer of the Indies, employed nearly fifty  years of his life in amassing materials for a history of Spanish  discovery and conquest in America.  For this, as he acted under  the authority of the government, every facility was afforded him;  and public offices and private depositories, in all the principal  cities of the empire, both at home and throughout the wide extent  of its colonial possessions, were freely opened to his  inspection.  The result was a magnificent collection of  manuscripts, many of which he patiently transcribed with his own  hand.  But he did not live to reap the fruits of his persevering  industry.  The first volume, relative to the voyages of Columbus,  was scarcely finished when he died; and his manuscripts, at least  that portion of them which have reference to Mexico and Peru,  were destined to serve the uses of another, an inhabitant of that  New World to which they related.    Another scholar, to whose literary stores I am largely indebted,  is Don Martin Fernandez de Navarrete, late Director of the Royal  Academy of History. Through the greater part of his long life he  was employed in assembling original documents to illustrate the  colonial annals.  Many of these have been incorporated in his  great work, \"Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos,\" which,  although far from being completed after the original plan of its  author, is of inestimable service to the historian.  In following  down the track of discovery, Navarrete turned aside from the  conquests of Mexico and Peru, to exhibit the voyages of his  countrymen in the Indian seas. His manuscripts, relating to the  two former countries, he courteously allowed to be copied for me.  Some of them have since appeared in print, under the auspices of  his learned coadjutors, Salva and Baranda, associated with him in  the Academy; but the documents placed in my hands form a most  important contribution to my materials for the present history.    The death of this illustrious man, which occurred some time after  the present work was begun, has left a void in his country not  easy to be filled; for he was zealously devoted to letters, and  few have done more to extend the knowledge of her colonial  history.  Far from an exclusive solicitude for his own literary  projects, he was ever ready to extend his sympathy and assistance  to those of others.  His reputation as a scholar was enhanced by  the higher qualities which he possessed as a man, - by his  benevolence, his simplicity of manners, and unsullied moral  worth.  My own obligations to him are large; for from the  publication of my first historical work, down to the last week of  his life, I have constantly received proofs from him of his  hearty and most efficient interest in the prosecution of my  historical labors; and I now the more willingly pay this  well-merited tribute to his deserts, that it must be exempt from  all suspicion of flattery.    In the list of those to whom I have been indebted for materials,  I must, also, include the name of M. Ternaux-Compans, so well  known by his faithful and elegant French versions of the Munoz  manuscripts; and that of my friend Don Pascual de Gayangos, who,  under the modest dress of translation, has furnished a most acute  and learned commentary on Spanish-Arabian history, - securing for  himself the foremost rank in that difficult department of  letters, which has been illumined by the labors of a Masdeu, a  Casiri, and a Conde.    To the materials derived from these sources, I have added some  manuscripts of an important character from the library of the  Escurial. These, which chiefly relate to the ancient institutions  of Peru, formed part of the splendid collection of Lord  Kingsborough, which has unfortunately shared the lot of most  literary collections, and been dispersed, since the death of its  noble author.  For these I am indebted to that industrious  bibliographer, Mr. O. Rich, now resident in London.  Lastly, I  must not omit to mention my obligations, in another way, to my  friend Charles Folsom, Esq., the learned librarian of the Boston  Athenaeum; whose minute acquaintance with the grammatical  structure and the true idiom of our English tongue has enabled me  to correct many inaccuracies into which I had fallen in the  composition both of this and of my former works.    From these different sources I have accumulated a large amount of  manuscripts, of the most various character, and from the most  authentic sources; royal grants and ordinances, instructions of  the Court, letters of the Emperor to the great colonial officers,  municipal records, personal diaries and memoranda, and a mass of  private correspondence of the principal actors in this turbulent  drama.  Perhaps it was the turbulent state of the country which  led to a more frequent correspondence between the government at  home and the colonial officers.  But, whatever be the cause, the  collection of manuscript materials in reference to Peru is fuller  and more complete than that which relates to Mexico; so that  there is scarcely a nook or corner so obscure, in the path of the  adventurer, that some light has not been thrown on it by the  written correspondence of the period.  The historian has rather  had occasion to complain of the embarras des richesses; for, in  the multiplicity of contradictory testimony, it is not always  easy to detect the truth, as the multiplicity of cross-lights is  apt to dazzle and bewilder the eye of the spectator.    The present History has been conducted on the same general plan  with that of the Conquest of Mexico.  In an Introductory Book, I  have endeavoured to portray the institutions of the Incas, that  the reader may be acquainted with the character and condition of  that extraordinary race, before he enters on the story of their  subjugation.  The remaining books are occupied with the narrative  of the Conquest.  And here, the subject, it must be allowed,  notwithstanding the opportunities it presents for the display of  character, strange, romantic incident, and picturesque scenery,  does not afford so obvious advantages to the historian as the  Conquest of Mexico.  Indeed, few subjects can present a parallel  with that, for the purposes either of the historian or the poet.  The natural development of the story, there, is precisely what  would be prescribed by the severest rules of art.  The conquest  of the country is the great end always in the view of the reader.  From the first landing of the Spaniards on the soil, their  subsequent adventures, their battles and negotiations, their  ruinous retreat, their rally and final siege, all tend to this  grand result, till the long series is closed by the downfall of  the capital.  In the march of events, all moves steadily forward  to this consummation.  It is a magnificent epic, in which the  unity of interest is complete.    In the \"Conquest of Peru,\" the action, so far as it is founded on  the subversion of the Incas, terminates long before the close of  the narrative. The remaining portion is taken up with the fierce  feuds of the Conquerors, which would seem, from their very  nature, to be incapable of being gathered round a central point  of interest.  To secure this, we must look beyond the immediate  overthrow of the Indian empire.  The conquest of the natives is  but the first step, to be followed by the conquest of the  Spaniards, - the rebel Spaniards, themselves, - till the  supremacy of the Crown is permanently established over the  country.  It is not till this period, that the acquisition of  this Transatlantic empire can be said to be completed; and, by  fixing the eye on this remoter point, the successive steps of the  narrative will be found leading to one great result, and that  unity of interest preserved which is scarcely less essential to  historic than dramatic composition.  How far this has been  effected, in the present work, must be left to the judgment of  the reader.    No history of the conquest of Peru, founded on original  documents, and aspiring to the credit of a classic composition,  like the \"Conquest of Mexico\" by Solis, has been attempted, as  far as I am aware, by the Spaniards. The English possess one of  high value, from the pen of Robertson, whose masterly sketch  occupies its due space in his great work on America.  It has been  my object to exhibit this same story, in all its romantic  details; not merely to portray the characteristic features of the  Conquest, but to fill up the outline with the coloring of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#1)"],[1,"been produced through the direct participation of over 500  Distributed Proofreaders Volunteers to commemorate the occasion of  DP's 5000th completed project.            [Illustration: I WILL MAKE A PRIEF OF IT IN MY NOTE-BOOK MERRY WIVES OF  WINDSOR]          A SHORT BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE    BY JOHN W. COUSIN    LONDON: PUBLISHED    by J.M. DENT & SONS. LTD    AND IN NEW YORK    BY E.P. DUTTON & CO          INTRODUCTION    The primary aim of this book is to give as much information about English  authors, including under this designation American and Colonial writers,  as the prescribed limits will admit of. At the same time an attempt has  been made, where materials exist for it, to enhance the interest by  introducing such details as tend to illustrate the characters and  circumstances of the respective writers and the manner in which they  passed through the world; and in the case of the more important, to give  some indication of the relative place which they hold and the leading  features of their work.    Including the Appendix of Living Writers, the work contains upwards of  1600 names; but large as this number is, the number of those who have  contributed something of interest and value to the vast store of English  Literature is larger still, and any attempt to make a book of this kind  absolutely exhaustive would be futile.    The word \"literature\" is here used in a very wide sense, and this gives  rise to considerable difficulty in drawing the line of exclusion. There  are very many writers whose claim to admission may reasonably be  considered as good as that of some who have been included; but even had  it been possible to discover all these, their inclusion would have  swelled the work beyond its limits. A line had to be drawn somewhere, and  the writer has used his best judgment in making that line as consistent  as possible. It may probably, however, be safely claimed that every  department of the subject of any importance is well represented.    Wherever practicable (and this includes all but a very few articles),  various authorities have been collated, and pains have been taken to  secure accuracy; but where so large a collection of facts and dates is  involved, it would be too sanguine to expect that success has invariably  been attained.

Among them are _Beechnut Tales_ and _The Rollo Books_, both of  which still have a very wide circulation.      ABBOTT, JOHN STEVENS CABOT (1805-1877).--Historian, etc., _b._ Brunswick,  Maine, and _ed._ at Bowdoin Coll. He studied theology and became a  minister of the Congregational Church at various places in Massachusetts  and Connecticut. Owing to the success of a little work, _The Mother at  Home_, he devoted himself, from 1844 onwards, to literature, and  especially to historical writing. Among his principal works, which were  very popular, are: _History of Napoleon Bonaparte_ (1852-55), _History of  the Civil War in America_ (1863-66), and _History of Frederick the Great_  (1871).      A BECKETT, GILBERT ABBOTT (1811-1856).--Comic writer, _b._ in London, the  _s._ of a lawyer, and belonged to a family claiming descent from Thomas a  Becket. Destined for the legal profession, he was called to the Bar. In  addition to contributions to various periodicals and newspapers,  including _Punch_, _The Illustrated London News_, _The Times_, and  _Morning Herald_, he produced over fifty plays, many of which attained  great popularity, and he also helped to dramatise some of Dickens' works.  He is perhaps best known as the author of _Comic History of England_,  _Comic History of Rome_, _Comic Blackstone_, etc. He was also  distinguished in his profession, acted as a commissioner on various  important matters, and was appointed a metropolitan police magistrate.      ABERCROMBIE, JOHN (1780-1844).--Physician and writer on mental science,  _s._ of a minister, was _b._ at Aberdeen, and _ed._ at the Grammar School  and Marischal College there. He studied medicine at Edinburgh, in which  city he practised as a physician. He made valuable contributions to the  literature of his profession, and _pub._ two works, _Enquiry Concerning  the Intellectual Powers_ (1830) and _The Philosophy of the Moral  Feelings_ (1833), which, though popular at the time of their publication,  have long been superseded. For his services as a physician and  philanthropist he received many marks of distinction, including the  Rectorship of Marischal College.      ABERCROMBIE, PATRICK (1656-1716).--Antiquary and historian, was physician  to James II. in 1685; he was a Jacobite and opposed the Union in various  pamphlets. His chief work was _Martial Achievements of the Scots Nation_  (1711-16).      ACTON, JOHN EMERICH EDWARD DALBERG-ACTON, 1ST LORD  (1834-1902).--Historian, _s._ of Sir Richard A., and grandson of Sir John  A., who was Prime Minister of Naples, was _b._ at Naples. He belonged to  an ancient Roman Catholic family, and was _ed._ first at Oscott near  Birmingham under Dr. (afterwards Card.) Wiseman. Thence he went to  Edinburgh, where he studied privately, and afterwards to Munich, where he  resided in the house of Dr. Dollinger, the great scholar and subsequent  leader of the Old Catholic party, by whom he was profoundly influenced.  While at Edinburgh he endeavoured to procure admission to Cambridge, but  without success, his religion being at that time a bar. He early devoted  himself to the study of history, and is said to have been on terms of  intimacy with every contemporary historian of distinction, with the  exception of Guizot. He sat in the House of Commons 1859-65, but made no  great mark, and in 1869 was raised to the peerage as Lord Acton of  Aldenham. For a time he edited _The Rambler_, a Roman Catholic  periodical, which afterwards became the _Home and Foreign Review_, and  which, under his care, became one of the most learned publications of the  day. The liberal character of A.'s views, however, led to its stoppage in  deference to the authorities of the Church. He, however, maintained a  lifelong opposition to the Ultramontane party in the Church, and in 1874  controverted their position in four letters to _The Times_ which were  described as the most crushing argument against them which ever appeared  in so condensed a form. A.'s contributions to literature were few, and,  in comparison with his extraordinary learning, comparatively unimportant.  He wrote upon _Cardinal Wolsey_ (1877) and _German Schools of History_  (1886). He was extremely modest, and the loftiness of his ideals of  accuracy and completeness of treatment led him to shrink from tasks which  men of far slighter equipment might have carried out with success. His  learning and his position as a universally acknowledged master in his  subject were recognised by his appointment in 1895 as Professor of Modern  History at Cambridge. Perhaps his most valuable services to historical  literature were his laying down the lines of the great _Cambridge Modern  History_, and his collection of a library of 60,000 vols., which after  his death was purchased by an American millionaire and presented to Lord  Morley of Blackburn, who placed it in the University of Cambridge.      ADAMNAN, ST. (625?-704).--Historian, _b._ in Donegal, became Abbot of  Iona in 679. Like other Irish churchmen he was a statesman as well as an  ecclesiastic, and appears to have been sent on various political  missions. In the great controversy on the subject of the holding of  Easter, he sided with Rome against the Irish Church. He left the earliest  account we have of the state of Palestine in the early ages of the  Church; but of even more value is his _Vita Sancti Columbae_, giving a  minute account of the condition and discipline of the church of Iona. He  _d._ 704.      ADAMS, FRANCIS, W.L. (1862-1893).--Novelist, was _b._ at Malta, and _ed._  at schools at Shrewsbury and in Paris. In 1882 he went to Australia, and  was on the staff of _The Sydney Bulletin_. In 1884 he _publ._ his  autobiographical novel, _Leicester_, and in 1888 _Songs of the Army of  the Night_, which created a"]]]
