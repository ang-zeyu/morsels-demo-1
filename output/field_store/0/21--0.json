Kerr & Company    1908            THE POSITIVE SCHOOL OF CRIMINOLOGY      I.    My Friends:    When, in the turmoil of my daily occupation, I received an invitation,  several months ago, from several hundred students of this famous  university, to give them a brief summary, in short special lectures, of  the principal and fundamental conclusions of criminal sociology, I  gladly accepted, because this invitation fell in with two ideals of  mine. These two ideals are stirring my heart and are the secret of my  life. In the first place, this invitation chimed with the ideal of my  personal life, namely, to diffuse and propagate among my brothers the  scientific ideas, which my brain has accumulated, not through any merit  of mine, but thanks to the lucky prize inherited from my mother in the  lottery of life. And the second ideal which this invitation called up  before my mind's vision was this: The ideal of young people of Italy,  united in morals and intellectual pursuits, feeling in their social  lives the glow of a great aim. It would matter little whether this aim  would agree with my own ideas or be opposed to them, so long as it  should be an ideal which would lift the aspirations of the young people  out of the fatal grasp of egoistic interests. Of course, we positivists  know very well, that the material requirements of life shape and  determine also the moral and intellectual aims of human consciousness.  But positive science declares the following to be the indispensable  requirement for the regeneration of human ideals: Without an ideal,  neither an individual nor a collectivity can live, without it humanity  is dead or dying. For it is the fire of an ideal which renders the life  of each one of us possible, useful and fertile. And only by its help can  each one of us, in the more or less short course of his or her  existence, leave behind traces for the benefit of fellow-beings. The  invitation extended to me proves that the students of Naples believe in  the inspiring existence of such an ideal of science, and are anxious to  learn more about ideas, with which the entire world of the present day  is occupied, and whose life-giving breath enters even through the  windows of the dry courtrooms, when their doors are closed against it.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us now speak of this new science, which has become known in Italy by  the name of the Positive School of Criminology. This science, the same  as every other phenomenon of scientific evolution, cannot be  shortsightedly or conceitedly attributed to the arbitrary initiative of  this or that thinker, this or that scientist. We must rather regard it  as a natural product, a necessary phenomenon, in the development of that  sad and somber department of science which deals with the disease of  crime. It is this plague of crime which forms such a gloomy and painful  contrast with the splendor of present-day civilization. The 19th century  has won a great victory over mortality and infectious diseases by means  of the masterful progress of physiology and natural science. But while  contagious diseases have gradually diminished, we see on the other hand  that moral diseases are growing more numerous in our so-called  civilization. While typhoid fever, smallpox, cholera and diphtheria  retreated before the remedies which enlightened science applied by means  of the experimental method, removing their concrete causes, we see on  the other hand that insanity, suicide and crime, that painful trinity,  are growing apace. And this makes it very evident that the science which  is principally, if not exclusively, engaged in studying these phenomena  of social disease, should feel the necessity of finding a more exact  diagnosis of these moral diseases of society, in order to arrive at some  effective and more humane remedy, which should more victoriously combat  this somber trinity of insanity, suicide and crime.    The science of positive criminology arose in the last quarter of the  19th century, as a result of this strange contrast, which would be  inexplicable, if we could not discover historical and scientific reasons  for its existence. And it is indeed a strange contrast that Italy should  have arrived at a perfect theoretical development of a classical school  of criminology, while there persists, on the other hand, the disgraceful  condition that criminality assumes dimensions never before observed in  this country, so that the science of criminology cannot stem the tide of  crime in high and low circles. It is for this reason, that the positive  school of criminology arises out of the very nature of things, the same  as every other line of science. It is based on the conditions of our  daily life. It would indeed be conceited on our part to claim that we,  who are the originators of this new science and its new conclusions,  deserve alone the credit for its existence. The brain of the scientist  is rather a sort of electrical accumulator, which feels and assimilates  the vibrations and heart-beats of life, its splendor and its shame, and  derives therefrom the conviction that it must of necessity provide for  definite social wants. And on the other hand, it would be an evidence of  intellectual short-sightedness on the part of the positivist man of  science, if he did not recognize the historical accomplishments, which  his predecessors on the field of science have left behind as indelible  traces of their struggle against the unknown in that brilliant and  irksome domain. For this reason, the adherents of the positive school of  criminology feel the most sincere reverence for the classic school of  criminology. And I am glad today, in accepting the invitation of the  students of Naples, to say, that this is another reason why their  invitation was welcome to me. It is now 16 years since I gave in this  same hall a lecture on positive criminology, which was then in its  initial stages. It was in 1885, when I had the opportunity to outline  the first principles of the positive school of criminology, at the  invitation of other students, who preceded you on the periodic waves of  the intellectual generations. And the renewal of this opportunity gave  me so much moral satisfaction that, I could not under any circumstances  decline your invitation. Then too, the Neapolitan Atheneum has  maintained the reputation of the Italian mind in the 19th century, also  in that science which even foreign scientists admit to be our specialty,  namely the science of criminology. In fact, aside from the two terrible  books of the Digest, and from the practical criminologists of the Middle  Ages who continued the study of criminality, the modern world opened a  glorious page in the progress of criminal science with the modest little  book of Cesare Beccaria. This progress leads from Cesare Beccaria, by  way of Francesco Carrara, to Enrico Pessina.    Enrico Pessina alone remains of the two giants who concluded the cycle  of classic school of criminology. In a lucid moment of his scientific  consciousness, which soon reverted to the old abstract and metaphysical  theories, he announced in an introductory statement in 1879, that  criminal justice would have to rejuvenate itself in the pure bath of the  natural sciences and substitute in place of abstraction the living and  concrete study of facts. Naturally every scientist has his function and  historical significance; and we cannot expect that a brain which has  arrived at the end of its career should turn towards a new direction. At  any rate, it is a significant fact that this most renowned  representative of the classic school of criminology should have pointed  out this need of his special science in this same university of Naples,  one year after the inauguration of the positive school of criminology,  that he should have looked forward to a time when the study of natural  and positive facts would set to rights the old juridical abstractions.  And there is still another precedent in the history of this university,  which makes scientific propaganda at this place very agreeable for a  positivist. It is that six years before that introductory statement by  Pessina, Giovanni Bovio gave lectures at this university, which he  published later on under the title of \"A Critical Study of Criminal  Law.\" Giovanni Bovio performed in this monograph the function of a  critic, but the historical time of his thought, prevented him from  taking part in the construction of a new science. However, he prepared  the ground for new ideas, by pointing out all the rifts and weaknesses  of the old building. Bovio maintained that which Gioberti, Ellero,  Conforti, Tissol had already maintained, namely that it is impossible to  solve the problem which is still the theoretical foundation of the  classic school of criminology, the problem of the relation between  punishment and crime. No man, no scientist, no legislator, no judge, has  ever been able to indicate any absolute standard, which would enable us  to say that equity demands a definite punishment for a definite crime.  We can find some opportunistic expedient, but not a solution of the  problem. Of course, if we could decide which is the gravest crime, then  we could also decide on the heaviest sentence and formulate a descending  scale which would establish the relative fitting proportions between  crime and punishment. If it is agreed that patricide is the gravest  crime, we meet out the heaviest sentence, death or imprisonment for  life, and then we can agree on a descending scale of crime and on a  parallel scale of punishments. But the problem begins right with the  first stone of the structure, not with the succeeding steps.

WRYKYN        PREFACE      In Evelyn Waugh's book _Decline and Fall_ his hero, applying for a post  as a schoolmaster, is told by the agent, \"We class schools in four  grades--leading school, first-rate school, good school, and school.\"  Sedleigh in Mike and Psmith would, I suppose, come into the last-named  class, though not quite as low in it as Mr. Waugh's Llanabba. It is one  of those small English schools with aspirations one day to be able to  put the word \"public\" before their name and to have their headmaster  qualified to attend the annual Headmaster's Conference. All it needs is  a few more Adairs to get things going. And there is this to be noted,  that even at a \"school\" one gets an excellent education. Its only  drawback is that it does not play the leading schools or the first-rate  schools or even the good schools at cricket. But to Mike, fresh from  Wrykyn (a \"first-rate school\") and Psmith, coming from Eton (a \"leading  school\") Sedleigh naturally seemed something of a comedown. It took Mike  some time to adjust himself to it, though Psmith, the philosopher,  accepted the change of conditions with his customary equanimity.    This was the first appearance of Psmith. He came into two other books,  _Psmith in the City_ and _Psmith, Journalist_, before becoming happily  married in _Leave It to Psmith_, but I have always thought that he was  most at home in this story of English school life. To give full play to  his bland clashings with Authority he needs to have authority to clash  with, and there is none more absolute than that of the masters at an  English school.    Psmith has the distinction of being the only one of my numerous  characters to be drawn from a living model. A cousin of mine was at Eton  with the son of D'Oyly Carte, the man who produced the Gilbert and  Sullivan operettas, and one night he told me about this peculiar  schoolboy who dressed fastidiously and wore a monocle and who, when one  of the masters inquired after his health, replied \"Sir, I grow thinnah  and thinnah.\" It was all the information I required in order to start  building him in a star part.    If anyone is curious as to what became of Mike and Psmith in later life,  I can supply the facts. Mike, always devoted to country life, ran a  prosperous farm. Psmith, inevitably perhaps, became an equally  prosperous counselor at the bar like Perry Mason, specializing, like  Perry, in appearing for the defense.    I must apologize, as I did in the preface to _Mike at Wrykyn,_ for all  the cricket in this book. It was unavoidable. There is, however, not  quite so much of it this time.    P.G. Wodehouse.        1    MR. JACKSON MAKES UP HIS MIND      If Mike had been in time for breakfast that fatal Easter morning he  might have gathered from the expression on his father's face, as Mr.  Jackson opened the envelope containing his school report and read the  contents, that the document in question was not exactly a paean of  praise from beginning to end. But he was late, as usual. Mike always was  late for breakfast in the holidays.    When he came down on this particular morning, the meal was nearly over.  Mr. Jackson had disappeared, taking his correspondence with him; Mrs.  Jackson had gone into the kitchen, and when Mike appeared the thing had  resolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between Phyllis and Ella for  the jam, while Marjory, recently affecting a grown-up air, looked on in  a detached sort of way, as if these juvenile gambols distressed her.    \"Hello, Mike,\" she said, jumping up as he entered, \"here you are--I've  been keeping everything hot for you.\"    \"Have you? Thanks awfully. I say ...\" His eye wandered in mild surprise  round the table. \"I'm a bit late.\"    Marjory was bustling about, fetching and carrying for Mike, as she  always did. She had adopted him at an early age, and did the thing  thoroughly. She was fond of her other brothers, especially when they  made centuries in first-class cricket, but Mike was her favorite. She  would field out in the deep as a natural thing when Mike was batting at  the net in the paddock, though for the others, even for Joe, who had  played in all five Test Matches in the previous summer, she would do it  only as a favor.    Phyllis and Ella finished their dispute and went out. Marjory sat on the  table and watched Mike eat.    \"Your report came this morning, Mike,\" she said.    The kidneys failed to retain Mike's undivided attention. He looked up  interested. \"What did it say?\"    \"I didn't see--I only caught sight of the Wrykyn crest on the envelope.  Father didn't say anything.\"    Mike seemed concerned. \"I say, that looks rather rotten! I wonder if it  was awfully bad. It's the first I've had from Appleby.\"    \"It can't be any worse than the horrid ones Mr. Blake used to write when  you were in his form.\"    \"No, that's a comfort,\" said Mike philosophically. \"Think there's any  more tea in that pot?\"    \"I call it a shame,\" said Marjory; \"they ought to be jolly glad to have  you at Wrykyn just for cricket, instead of writing beastly reports that  make father angry and don't do any good to anybody.\"    \"Last Christmas he said he'd take me away if I got another one.\"    \"He didn't mean it really, I _know_ he didn't! He couldn't! You're the  best bat Wrykyn's ever had.\"    \"What ho!\" interpolated Mike.    \"You _are_. Everybody says you are. Why, you got your first the very  first term you were there--even Joe didn't do anything nearly so good as  that. Saunders says you're simply bound to play for England in another  year or two.\"    \"Saunders is a jolly good chap. He bowled me a half volley on the off  the first ball I had in a school match. By the way, I wonder if he's out  at the net now. Let's go and see.\"    Saunders the professional was setting up the net when they arrived. Mike  put on his pads and went to the wicket, while Marjory and the dogs  retired as usual to the far hedge to retrieve.    She was kept busy. Saunders was a good sound bowler of the M.C.C. minor  match type, and there had been a time when he had worried Mike  considerably, but Mike had been in the Wrykyn team for three seasons  now, and each season he had advanced tremendously in his batting. He had  filled out in three years. He had always had the style, and now he had  the strength as well, Saunder's bowling on a true wicket seemed simple  to him. It was early in the Easter holidays, but already he was  beginning to find his form. Saunders, who looked on Mike as his own  special invention, was delighted.    \"If you don't be worried by being too anxious now that you're captain,  Master Mike,\" he said, \"you'll make a century every match next term.\"    \"I wish I wasn't; it's a beastly responsibility.\"    Henfrey, the Wrykyn cricket captain of the previous season, was not  returning next term, and Mike was to reign in his stead. He liked the  prospect, but it certainly carried with it a rather awe-inspiring  responsibility. At night sometimes he would lie awake, appalled by the  fear of losing his form, or making a hash of things by choosing the  wrong men to play for the school and leaving the right men out. It is no  light thing to captain a public school at cricket.    As he was walking toward the house, Phyllis met him. \"Oh, I've been  hunting for you, Mike; Father wants you.\"    \"What for?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Where?\"    \"He's in the study. He seems ...\" added Phyllis, throwing in the  information by a way of a makeweight, \"in a beastly temper.\"    Mike's jaw fell slightly. \"I hope the dickens it's nothing to do with  that bally report,\" was his muttered exclamation.    Mike's dealings with his father were as a rule of a most pleasant  nature. Mr. Jackson was an understanding sort of man, who treated his  sons as companions. From time to time, however, breezes were apt to  ruffle the placid sea of good fellowship. Mike's end-of-term report was  an unfailing wind raiser; indeed, on the arrival of Mr. Blake's  sarcastic resume of Mike's shortcomings at the end of the previous term,  there had been something not unlike a typhoon. It was on this occasion  that Mr. Jackson had solemnly declared his intention of removing Mike  from Wrykyn unless the critics became more flattering; and Mr. Jackson  was a man of his word.    It was with a certain amount of apprehension, therefore, that Jackson  entered the study.    \"Come in, Mike,\" said his father, kicking the waste-paper basket; \"I  want to speak to you.\"    Mike, skilled in omens, scented a row in the offing. Only in moments of  emotion was Mr. Jackson in the habit of booting the basket.    There followed an awkward silence, which Mike broke by remarking that he  had carted a half volley from Saunders over the on-side hedge  that morning.    \"It was just a bit short and off the leg stump, so I stepped out--may I  bag the paper knife for a jiffy? I'll just show--\"    \"Never mind about cricket now,\" said Mr. Jackson; \"I want you to listen  to this report.\"    \"Oh,"]]]
