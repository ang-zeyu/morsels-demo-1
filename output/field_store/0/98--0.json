Then she spoke as follows: \"You go slow there in the City. You know your  Failin's. You're just full of the Old Harry, and when you're Het Up  you're just like as not to Raise Ned.\"    \"I guess I can take keer of myse'f about as well as the Next One,\"  retorted Uncle Brewster. \"I've been to the Mill an' got my Grist, if any  one should ask. I ain't no Greeny.\"    With that he started for the Train, which was due in one Hour.    As he rode toward the Great City he smoked a Baby Mine Cigar, purchased  of the Butcher, and told the Brakeman a few Joe Millers just to throw  out the Impression that he was Fine and Fancy.    After he had Registered at the Hotel and Swelled Up properly when  addressed as \"Mister\" by the Clerk, he wanted to know if there was a  Lively Show in Town. The Clerk told him to follow the Street until he  came to all the Electric Lights, and there he would find a Ballet. Uncle  Brewster found the Place, and looked in through the Hole at an Assistant  Treasurer, who was Pale and wore a Red Vest.    [Illustration: UNCLE BREWSTER]    \"I want a Chair near the Band,\" said Uncle Brewster. \"How much does one  of 'em Fetch?\"    \"Two Dollars,\" replied the Assistant Treasurer, pulling down his Cuffs  and then examining himself in a small Mirror at one side of the Diagram.    \"Great Grief!\" ejaculated Uncle Brewster. \"I only paid Thirty-Five Cents  for the Glass Blowers, an' I'll warrant you they beat your Troupe as bad  as Cranberries beats Glue. I'll see you plumb in Halifax before I--\"    \"Stand aside, please,\" said the Assistant Treasurer.    Uncle Brewster saw a Policeman, and thought it his Duty to tell the  Officer that the Theater Folks were a Pack of Robbers.    \"Up an Alley,\" said the Policeman.    Instead of going to a Show, Uncle Brewster stood in front of a Clothing  Store and watched the Wax Figures.    When he got back to his Room the Bell-Hopper came around and asked him  if he cared to Sit in a Quiet Game. Uncle Brewster wanted to know  whether they were Gamblers or Business Men, and the Boy said they were  Business Men. It was all Friendly, with an Ante of Two Bits and the  Chandelier as the Limit. Uncle Brewster said he was accustomed to  playing with Lima Beans, Three for a Cent and One call Two and no fair  to Bluff. The Bell-Hopper told him to Turn In and get a Good Night's  Rest.    Next Morning at the Hotel he spotted a stylish little Chunk of a Woman  who kept the Cigar Case and sold Books with Actress Photos on the  outside.    He walked over to buy a Cigar, but he happened to see the \"3 for 50c.\"  Label and his Feet got cold.    So, instead of buying a Cigar, he conversed with the Proprietress. He  seemed to be a Success with her, and ventured to say that he was a  Stranger in Town and would like first-rate to go out to a Lecture or  some other kind of Entertainment that Evening if he could find a Nice  Girl that didn't mind going with a Respectable Man who could give  References, and besides was nearly old enough to be her Father. Then  after the Lecture they could go to a First-Class Restaurant and have an  Oyster Stew.    [Illustration: THE INVITATION]    Uncle Brewster had read the Illustrated Papers in the Barber Shop out  Home, and he certainly knew what was Expected of a Man who wanted to  give a Gay Girl the Time of her Life.    The Cigar and Literary Girl said she would be Charmed to Accompany him  only for one Thing: She said she didn't have a Hat that was Fit to Wear.  She said she could tell by his Looks that he was a Gentleman that  wouldn't want to go anywhere with a Lady whose Lid was Tacky. Possibly  he would be willing to Stake her to a Hat.    \"What would the Hat come to?\" asked Uncle Brewster, somewhat Leary.    \"Only Fourteen Dollars,\" she replied.    \"I'll Think it Over,\" quoth Uncle Brewster, in a choking Voice, and he  was so Groggy he walked into the Elevator instead of going out the  Street Door.    A little while later Uncle Brewster met an Acquaintance who gave him a  Complimentary Badge to the Races. He walked out to the Track, so as to  make the Expense as Reasonable as possible.    As soon as he was in the Ring a Tout took him back of a Hot Sausage  Booth and told him not to Give it Out, but Green Pill in the First Race  was sure to Win as far as a man could throw an Anvil, and to hurry and  get a Piece of Money on. Uncle Brewster looked at the Entries and began  to Quiver. He wished that Doc Jimmison could be there to Advise him.  Green Pill was 30 to 1, and the Tout had his information from a Stable  Boy that slept with the Horse.    A Reckless Spirit seized Uncle Brewster. He said he would take a Chance  even if he didn't know for Sure that he would Win. So he walked up to a  Bookie and said to him: \"I want to Bet Fifty Cents on Green Pill, and  this is a Dollar here, so you want to give me Fifty Cents Change.\"    Whereupon the Bookie told him to Back Up and Fade and do a Disappearing  Specialty.    Uncle Brewster Escaped and found himself at a Bar. He decided that he  would take a Drink, because he wouldn't be Home until next Day and by  that time it would be off his Breath.    [Illustration: NON-COMBUSTIBLE]    So he laid his Bosom against the Brass Railing and said to the Man in  White, \"You might as well draw me a Glass of Beer.\"    \"We've got it in Bottles,\" said the Barkeep, regarding Uncle Brewster  without a sign of Enthusiasm.    \"What do you git for a Bottle?\" asked Uncle Brewster.    \"Twenty Cents,\" was the Reply of the Liquor Clerk.    \"Keep it,\" said Uncle Brewster.    Perceiving that the Race-Track was in the hands of Gougers, Uncle  Brewster walked back to the Hotel. By that Time his New Shoes had  Crippled him, and he decided to take the Afternoon Train for home  instead of Waiting Over.    That Evening he was back at his own Fireside, with the Bunged-Up Feet  resting in Carpet Slippers. As he sat and read the Poultry Magazine,  Aunt Mehely looked at him sidewise, and full of Suspicion said, \"I  s'pose you just Played Hob there in the City.\"    And Uncle Brewster replied as follows: \"No, Mother, I didn't Drink and I  didn't Gamble. I didn't do Nothin'--not even go to a Theayter.\"    And as he spoke an Aureole of Virtue seemed to curdle above him, while  his Countenance bore an Expression of Placid Triumph, which meant that  he was the real Asbestos Paragon who had been tried in the Furnace and  declared Non-Combustible.    MORAL: _Some People are Good because it Comes High to be Otherwise_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ GRASS WIDOW _AND THE_ MESMEREE _AND THE_ SIX  DOLLARS      One Day a keen Business manager who thought nobody could Show him was  sitting at his Desk. A Grass Widow floated in, and stood Smiling at him.  She was a Blonde, and had a Gown that fit her as if she had been Packed  into it by Hydraulic Pressure. She was just as Demure as Edna May ever  tried to be, but the Business Manager was a Lightning Calculator, and he  Surmised that the Bunk was about to be Handed to him. The Cold Chills  went down his Spine when he caught a Flash of the Half-Morocco  Prospectus.    If it had been a Man Agent he would have shouted \"Sick 'em\" and reached  for a Paper-Weight. But when the Agent has the Venus de Milo beaten on  Points and Style, and when the Way the Skirt sets isn't so Poor, and she  is Coy and introduces the Startled Fawn way of backing up without  getting any farther away, and when she comes on with short Steps, and he  gets the remote Swish of the Real Silk, to say nothing of the Faint  Aroma of New-Mown Hay, and her Hesitating Manner seems to ask, \"Have I  or have I not met a Friend?\"--in a Case of that kind, the Victim is just  the same as Strapped to the Operating-Table. He has about One Chance in  a Million.    The timorous but trusting little Grass Widow sat beside the Business  Manager and told him her Hard-Luck Story in low, bird-like Notes. She  said she was the only Support of her Little Boy, who was attending a  Military School at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11938"],[0,"Folklore of the Santal Parganas (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net/                                  Folklore of the Santal Parganas                                   Translated by                             Cecil Henry Bompas                        of the Indian Civil Service                                          1909            Preface    The Santals are a Munda tribe, a branch of that aboriginal element  which probably entered India from the North East. At the present day  they inhabit the Eastern outskirts of the Chutia Nagpore plateau.    Originally hunters and dwellers in the jungle they are still but  indifferent agriculturists. Like the Mundas and Hos and other  representatives of the race, they are jovial in character, fond of  their rice beer, and ready to take a joke.    Their social organization is very complete; each village has its  headman or manjhi, with his assistant the paranik; the jogmanghi  is charged with the supervision of the morals of the young men and  women; the naeke is the village priest, the godet is the village  constable. Over a group of villages is the pargana or tribal chief. The  Santals are divided into exogamous septs--originally twelve in number,  and their social observances are complex, e.g. while some relations  treat each other with the greatest reserve, between others the utmost  freedom of intercourse is allowed.    Their religion is animistic, spirits (_bongas_) are everywhere around  them: the spirits of their ancestors, the spirit of the house, the  spirit dwelling in the patch of primeval forest preserved in each  village. Every hill tree and rock may have its spirit. These spirits  are propitiated by elaborate ceremonies and sacrifices which generally  terminate in dances, and the drinking of rice beer.    The Santal Parganas is a district 4800 sq. miles in area, lying  about 150 miles north of Calcutta, and was formed into a separate  administration after the Santals had risen in rebellion in 1856. The  Santals at present form about one-third of the population.    The stories and legends which are here translated have been collected  by the Rev. O. Bodding, D.D. of the Scandinavian Mission to the  Santals. To be perfectly sure that neither language nor ideas should in  any way be influenced by contact with a European mind he arranged for  most of them to be written out in Santali, principally by a Christian  convert named Sagram Murmu, at present living at Mohulpahari in the  Santal Parganas.    Santali is an agglutinative language of great regularity and complexity  but when the Santals come in contact with races speaking an Aryan  language it is apt to become corrupted with foreign idioms. The  language in which these stories have been written is beautifully  pure, and the purity of language may be accepted as an index that  the ideas have not been affected, as is often the case, by contact  with Europeans.    My translation though somewhat condensed is very literal, and the  stories have perhaps thereby an added interest as shewing the way in  which a very primitive people look at things. The Santals are great  story tellers; the old folk of the village gather the young people  round them in the evening and tell them stories, and the men when  watching the crops on the threshing floor will often sit up all night  telling stories.    There is however, no doubt that at the present time the knowledge of  these stories tends to die out. Under the peace which British rule  brings there is more intercourse between the different communities  and castes, a considerable, degree of assimilation takes place,  and old customs and traditions tend to be obliterated.    Several collections of Indian stories have been made, _e.g._ Stokes,  Indian Fairy Tales; Frere, Old Deccan Days; Day, Folk Tales of  Bengal; and Knowles' Folk Tales of Kashmir, and it will be seen  that all the stories in the present collection are by no means of  pure Santal origin. Incidents which form part of the common stock of  Indian folklore abound, and many of the stories professedly relate  to characters of various Hindu castes, others again deal with such  essentially Santal beliefs as the dealings of men and _bongas_.    The Rev. Dr. Campbell of Gobindpore published in 1891 a collection  of Santal Folk Tales. He gathered his material in the District of  Manbhum, and many of the stories are identical with those included in  the present volume. I have added as an appendix some stories which I  collected among the Hos of Singhbhum, a tribe closely related to the  Santals, and which the Asiatic Society of Bengal has kindly permitted  me to reprint here.    My task has been merely one of translation; it is due solely to Mr  Bodding's influence with, and intimate knowledge of, the people that  the stories have been committed to writing, and I have to thank him  for assistance and advice throughout my work of translation.    I have roughly classified the stories: in part 1 are stories of a  general character; part 2, stories relating to animals; in part 3,  stories which are scarcely folklore but are anecdotes relating to  Santal life; in Part 4, stories relating to the dealings of _bongas_  and men. In part 5, are some legends and traditions, and a few notes  relating to tribal customs. Part 6 contains illustrations of the  belief in witchcraft. I have had to omit a certain number of stories  as unsuited for publication.    C. H. Bompas.        Table of Contents    PART I      I.        Bajun and Jhore  II.
