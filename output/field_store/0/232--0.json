PREFACE    In attempting to get what is little less than a history of the world,  from a special point of view, into a couple of hundred duodecimo  pages, I have had to make three bites at my very big cherry. In the  Appendix I have given in chronological order, and for the first  time on such a scale in English, the chief voyages and explorations  by which our knowledge of the world has been increased, and the  chief works in which that knowledge has been recorded. In the body  of the work I have then attempted to connect together these facts  in their more general aspects. In particular I have grouped the  great voyages of 1492-1521 round the search for the Spice Islands  as a central motive. It is possible that in tracing the Portuguese  and Spanish discoveries to the need of titillating the parched  palates of the mediaevals, who lived on salt meat during winter and  salt fish during Lent, I may have unduly simplified the problem.  But there can be no doubt of the paramount importance attached  to the spices of the East in the earlier stages. The search for  the El Dorado came afterwards, and is still urging men north to  the Yukon, south to the Cape, and in a south-easterly direction  to \"Westralia.\"    Besides the general treatment in the text and the special details  in the Appendix, I have also attempted to tell the story once more  in a series of maps showing the gradual increase of men's knowledge  of the globe. It would have been impossible to have included all  these in a book of this size and price but for the complaisance  of several publishing firms, who have given permission for the  reproduction on a reduced scale of maps that have already been  prepared for special purposes. I have specially to thank Messrs.  Macmillan for the two dealing with the Portuguese discoveries,  and derived from Mr. Payne's excellent little work on European  Colonies; Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Co., of Boston, for several  illustrating the discovery of America, from Mr. J. Fiske's \"School  History of the United States;\" and Messrs. Phillips for the arms  of Del Cano, so clearly displaying the \"spicy\" motive of the first  circumnavigation of the globe.    I have besides to thank the officials of the Royal Geographical  Society, especially Mr. Scott Keltie and Dr. H. R. Mill, for the  readiness with which they have placed the magnificent resources  of the library and map-room of that national institution at my  disposal, and the kindness with which they have answered my queries  and indicated new sources of information.

By kind  permission of Messrs. Phillips).--It illustrates the importance  attributed to the Spice Islands as the main object of Magellan's  voyage. For the blazon, see pp. 129-30.    THE EARLIEST MAP OF THE WORLD (from the Rev. C. J. Ball's _Bible  Illustrations_, 1898).--This is probably of the eighth century  B.C., and indicates the Babylonian view of the world surrounded by  the ocean, which is indicated by the parallel circles, and traversed  by the Euphrates, which is seen meandering through the middle, with  Babylon, the great city, crossing it at the top. Beyond the ocean  are seven successive projections of land, possibly indicating the  Babylonian knowledge of surrounding countries beyond the Euxine  and the Red Sea.    THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PTOLEMY.--It will be observed that the Greek  geographer regarded the Indian Ocean as a landlocked body of water,  while he appears to have some knowledge of the so ces of the Nile.  The general tendency of the map is to extend Asia very much to  the east, which led to the miscalculation encouraging Columbus to  discover America.    THE ROMAN ROADS OF EUROPE (drawn specially for this work).--These  give roughly the limits within which the inland geographical knowledge  of the ancients reach some degrees of accuracy.    GEOGRAPHICAL MONSTERS (from an early edition of Mandeville's  _Travels_).--Most of the mediaeval maps were dotted over with similar  monstrosities.    THE HEREFORD MAP.--This, one of the best known of mediaeval maps,  was drawn by Richard of Aldingham about 1307. Like most of these  maps, it has the East with the terrestrial paradise at the top,  and Jerusalem is represented as the centre.    PEUTINGER TABLE, WESTERN PART.--This is the only Roman map extant;  it gives lines of roads from the eastern shores of Britain to the  Adriatic Sea. It is really a kind of bird's-eye view taken from  the African coast. The Mediterranean runs as a thin strip through  the lower part of the map. The lower section joins on to the upper.    THE WORLD ACCORDING TO IBN HAUKAL (from Lelewel, _Geographie du  mon age_).--This map, like most of the Arabian maps, has the south  at the top. It is practically only a diagram, and is thus similar  to the Hereford Map in general form.--Misr=Egypt, Fars=Persia,  Andalus=Spain.    COAST-LINE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN (from the _Portulano_ of Dulcert,  1339, given in Nordenskiold's _Facsimile Atlas_).--To illustrate  the accuracy with which mariners' charts gave the coast-lines as  contrasted with the merely symbolical representation of other mediaeval  maps.    FRA MAURO MAP, 1457 (from Lelewel, _loc. Cit._).--Here, as usual,  the south is placed at the top of the map. Besides the ordinary  mediaeval conceptions, Fra Mauro included the Portuguese discoveries  along the coast of Africa up to his time, 1457.    PORTUGUESE DISCOVERIES IN AFRICA (from E. J. Payne, _European Colonies_,  1877).--Giving the successive points reached by the Portuguese  navigators during the fifteenth century.    PORTUGUESE INDIES (from Payne, _loc. Cit._).--All the ports mentioned  in ordinary type were held by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century.    THE TOSCANELLI MAP (from Kretschmer, _Entdeckung Amerikas_, 1892).--This  is a reconstruction of the map which Columbus got from the Italian  astronomer and cartographer Toscanelli and used to guide him in  his voyage across the Atlantic. Its general resemblance to the  Behaim Globe will be remarked.    THE BEHAIM GLOBE.--This gives the information about the world possessed  in 1492, just as Columbus was starting, and is mainly based upon the  map of Toscanelli, which served as his guide. It will be observed  that there is no other continent between Spain and Zipangu or Japan,  while the fabled islands of St. Brandan and Antilia are represented  bridging the expanse between the Azores and Japan.    AMERIGO VESPUCCI (from Fiske's _School History of the United States_,  by kind permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Co.)    FERDINAND MAGELLAN (from Fiske's _School History of the United  States_, by kind permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Co.)    MAP OF THE WORLD, from the Ptolemy Edition of 1548 (after Kretschmer's  _Entdeckungsgeschichte Amerikas_).--It will be observed that Mexico  is supposed to be joined on to Asia, and that the North Pacific  was not even known to exist.    RUSSIAN ASIA (after the Atlas published by the Russian Academy of  Sciences in 1737, by kind permission of Messrs. Hachette). Japan  is represented as a peninsula.    AUSTRALIA AS KNOWN IN 1745 (from D'Anville's _Atlas_, by kind permission  of Messrs. Hachette).--It will be seen that the Northern and Western  coasts were even by this time tolerably well mapped out, leaving  only the eastern coast to be explored by Cook.    AUSTRALIA, showing routes of explorations (prepared specially for  the present volume). The names of the chief explorers are given  at the top of the map.    AFRICA AS KNOWN IN 1676 (from Dapper's _Atlas_).--This includes  a knowledge of most of the African river sand lakes due to the  explorations of the Portuguese.    AFRICA (made specially for this volume, to show chief explorations  and partition).--The names of the explorers are given at the foot  of the map itself.    NORTH POLAR REGIONS, WESTERN HALF (prepared specially for the present  volume from the _Citizen's Atlas_, by kind permission of Messrs.  Bartholomew).--This gives the results of the discoveries due to  Franklin expeditions and most of the searchers after the North-West  Passage.    NORTH POLAR REGIONS, EASTERN HALF.--This gives the Siberian coast  investigated by the Russians and Nordenskiold, as well as Nansen's  _Farthest North_.    CLIMBING THE NORTH POLE (prepared specially for this volume). Giving  in graphic form the names of the chief Arctic travellers and the  latitude N. reached from John Davis (1587) to Nansen (1895).          THE STORY OF    GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY          INTRODUCTION    How was the world discovered? That is to say, how did a certain  set of men who lived round the Mediterranean Sea, and had acquired  the art of recording what each generation had learned, become  successively aware of the other parts of the globe?

All the  cheese-fanciers are out, thumping the cannon-ball Edams and the  millstone Goudas with their bare red knuckles, plugging in with a  hollow steel tool for samples. In Holland the business of judging a  crumb of cheese has been taken with great seriousness for centuries.  The abracadabra is comparable to that of the wine-taster or  tea-taster. These Edamers have the trained ear of music-masters and,  merely by knuckle-rapping, can tell down to an air pocket left by a  gas bubble just how mature the interior is.    The connoisseurs use gingerbread as a mouth-freshener; and I, too,  that sunny day among the Edams, kept my gingerbread handy and made my  way from one fine cheese to another, trying out generous plugs from  the heaped cannon balls that looked like the ammunition dump at  Antietam.    I remember another market day, this time in Lucerne. All morning I  stocked up on good Schweizerkaese and better Gruyere. For lunch I had  cheese salad. All around me the farmers were rolling two-hundred-pound  Emmentalers, bigger than oxcart wheels. I sat in a little cafe,  absorbing cheese and cheese lore in equal quantities. I learned that a  prize cheese must be chock-full of equal-sized eyes, the gas holes  produced during fermentation. They must glisten like polished bar  glass. The cheese itself must be of a light, lemonish yellow. Its  flavor must be nutlike. (Nuts and Swiss cheese complement each other  as subtly as Gorgonzola and a ripe banana.) There are, I learned,  \"blind\" Swiss cheeses as well, but the million-eyed ones are better.    But I don't have to hark back to Switzerland and Holland for cheese  memories. Here at home we have increasingly taken over the cheeses of  all nations, first importing them, then imitating them, from Swiss  Engadine to what we call Genuine Sprinz. We've naturalized  Scandinavian Blues and smoked browns and baptized our own Saaland  Pfarr in native whiskey. Of fifty popular Italian types we duplicate  more than half, some fairly well, others badly.    We have our own legitimate offspring too, beginning with the  Pineapple, supposed to have been first made about 1845 in Litchfield  County, Connecticut. We have our own creamy Neufchatel, New York Coon,  Vermont Sage, the delicious Liederkranz, California Jack, Nuworld, and  dozens of others, not all quite so original.    And, true to the American way, we've organized cheese-eating. There's  an annual cheese week, and a cheese month (October). We even boast a  mail-order Cheese-of-the-Month Club. We haven't yet reached the point  of sophistication, however, attained by a Paris cheese club that meets  regularly. To qualify for membership you have to identify two hundred  basic cheeses, and you have to do it blindfolded.    This is a test I'd prefer not to submit to, but in my amateur way I  have during the past year or two been sharpening my cheese perception  with whatever varieties I could encounter around New York. I've run  into briny Caucasian Cossack, Corsican Gricotta, and exotics like  Rarush Durmar, Travnik, and Karaghi La-la. Cheese-hunting is one of  the greatest--and least competitively crowded--of sports. I hope this  book may lead others to give it a try.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Two_    The Big Cheese      One of the world's first outsize cheeses officially weighed in at four  tons in a fair at Toronto, Canada, seventy years ago. Another  monstrous Cheddar tipped the scales at six tons in the New York State  Fair at Syracuse in 1937.    Before this, a one-thousand-pounder was fetched all the way from New  Zealand to London to star in the Wembley Exposition of 1924. But,  compared to the outsize Syracusan, it looked like a Baby Gouda. As a  matter of fact, neither England nor any of her great dairying colonies  have gone in for mammoth jobs, except Canada, with that four-tonner  shown at Toronto.    We should mention two historic king-size Chesters. You can find out  all about them in _Cheddar Gorge,_ edited by Sir John Squire. The  first of them weighed 149 pounds, and was the largest made, up to the  year 1825. It was proudly presented to H.R.H. the Duke of York. (Its  heft almost tied the 147-pound Green County wheel of Wisconsin Swiss  presented by the makers to President Coolidge in 1928 in appreciation  of his raising the protective tariff against genuine Swiss to 50  percent.) While the cheese itself weighed a mite under 150, His Royal  Highness, ruff, belly, knee breeches, doffed high hat and all, was a  hundred-weight heavier, and thus almost dwarfed it.    It was almost a century later that the second record-breaking Chester  weighed in, at only 200 pounds. Yet it won a Gold Medal and a  Challenge Cup and was presented to the King, who graciously accepted  it. This was more than Queen Victoria had done with a bridal gift  cheese that tipped the scales at 1,100 pounds. It took a whole day's  yield from 780 contented cows, and stood a foot and eight inches high,  measuring nine feet, four inches around the middle. The assembled  donors of the cheese were so proud of it that they asked royal  permission to exhibit it on a round of country fairs. The Queen  assented to this ambitious request, perhaps prompted by the  exhibition-minded Albert. The publicity-seeking cheesemongers assured  Her Majesty that the gift would be returned to her just as soon as it  had been exhibited. But the Queen didn't want it back after it was  show-worn. The donors began to quarrel among themselves about what to  do with the remains, until finally it got into Chancery where so many  lost causes end their days. The cheese was never heard of again.    While it is generally true that the bigger the cheese the better,  (much the same as a magnum bottle of champagne is better than a pint),  there is a limit to the obesity of a block, ball or brick of almost  any kinds of cheese. When they pass a certain limit, they lack  homogeneity and are not nearly so good as the smaller ones. Today a  good magnum size for an exhibition Cheddar is 560 pounds; for a prize  Provolone, 280 pounds; while a Swiss wheel of only 210 will draw  crowds to any food-shop window.    Yet by and large it's the monsters that get into the Cheese Hall of  Fame and come down to us in song and story. For example, that four-ton  Toronto affair inspired a cheese poet, James McIntyre, who doubled as  the local undertaker.        We have thee, mammoth cheese,      Lying quietly at your ease;      Gently fanned by evening breeze,      Thy fair form no flies dare seize.        All gaily dressed soon you'll go      To the greatest provincial show,      To be admired by many a beau      In the city of Toronto.        May you not receive a scar as      We have heard that Mr. Harris      Intends to send you off as far as      The great world's show at Paris.        Of the youth beware of these,      For some of them might rudely squeeze      And bite your cheek; then song or glees      We could not sing, oh, Queen of Cheese.    An ode to a one hundred percent American mammoth was inspired by \"The  Ultra-Democratic, Anti-Federalist Cheese of Cheshire.\" This was in the  summer of 1801 when the patriotic people of Cheshire, Massachusetts,  turned out en masse to concoct a mammoth cheese on the village green  for presentation to their beloved President Jefferson. The unique  demonstration occurred spontaneously in jubilant commemoration of the  greatest political triumph of a new country in a new century--the  victory of the Democrats over the Federalists. Its collective making  was heralded in Boston's _Mercury and New England Palladium_,  September 8, 1801:        _The Mammoth Cheese_        AN EPICO-LYRICO BALLAD        From meadows rich, with clover red,        A thousand heifers come;      The tinkling bells the tidings spread,      The milkmaid muffles up her head,        And wakes the village hum.        In shining pans the snowy flood        Through whitened canvas pours;      The dyeing pots of otter good      And rennet tinged with madder blood        Are sought among their stores.        The quivering curd, in panniers stowed,        Is loaded on the jade,      The stumbling beast supports the load,      While trickling whey bedews the road        Along the dusty glade.        As Cairo's slaves, to bondage bred,        The arid deserts roam,      Through trackless sands undaunted tread,      With skins of water on their head        To cheer their masters home,        So here full many a sturdy swain        His precious baggage bore;      Old misers e'en forgot their gain,      And bed-rid cripples, free from pain,        Now took the road before.
