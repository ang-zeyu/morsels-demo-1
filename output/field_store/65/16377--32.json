No other country in the world is so strangely shaped, so  long compared to its width, so straggling, so hard to govern from a  single centre.    At the first glance, the country seems to divide itself into two  strongly contrasted regions; and this was the original impression which  it made upon its inhabitants. The natives from a very early time  designated their land as \"the two lands,\" and represented it by a  hieroglyph in which the form used to express \"land\" was doubled. The  kings were called \"chiefs of the Two Lands,\" and wore two crowns, as  being kings of two countries. The Hebrews caught up the idea, and though  they sometimes called Egypt \"Mazor\" in the singular number, preferred  commonly to designate it by the dual form \"Mizraim,\" which means \"the  two Mazors.\" These \"two Mazors,\" \"two Egypts,\" or \"two lands,\" were, of  course, the blossom and the stalk, the broad tract upon the  Mediterranean known as \"Lower Egypt,\" or \"the Delta,\" and the long  narrow valley that lies, like a green snake, to the south, which bears  the name of \"Upper Egypt,\" or \"the Said.\" Nothing is more striking than  the contrast between these two regions. Entering Egypt from the  Mediterranean, or from Asia by the caravan route, the traveller sees  stretching before him an apparently boundless plain, wholly unbroken by  natural elevations, generally green with crops or with marshy plants,  and canopied by a cloudless sky, which rests everywhere on a distant  flat horizon. An absolute monotony surrounds him. No alternation of  plain and highland, meadow and forest, no slopes of hills, or hanging  woods, or dells, or gorges, or cascades, or rushing streams, or babbling  rills, meet his gaze on any side; look which way he will, all is  sameness, one vast smooth expanse of rich alluvial soil, varying only in  being cultivated or else allowed to lie waste. Turning his back with  something of weariness on the dull uniformity of this featureless plain,  the wayfarer proceeds southwards, and enters, at the distance of a  hundred miles from the coast, on an entirely new scene. Instead of an  illimitable prospect meeting him on every side, he finds himself in a  comparatively narrow vale, up and down which the eye still commands an  extensive view, but where the prospect on either side is blocked at the  distance of a few miles by rocky ranges of hills, white or yellow or  tawny, sometimes drawing so near as to threaten an obstruction of the  river course, sometimes receding so far as to leave some miles of  cultivable soil on either side of the stream. The rocky ranges, as he  approaches them, have a stern and forbidding aspect. They rise for the  most part, abruptly in bare grandeur; on their craggy sides grows  neither moss nor heather; no trees clothe their steep heights. They seem  intended, like the mountains that enclosed the abode of Rasselas, to  keep in the inhabitants of the vale within their narrow limits, and bar  them out from any commerce or acquaintance with the regions beyond.    Such is the twofold division of the country which impresses the observer  strongly at the first. On a longer sojourn and a more intimate  familiarity, the twofold division gives place to one which is threefold.  The lower differs from the upper valley, it is a sort of debatable  region, half plain, half vale; the cultivable surface spreads itself out  more widely, the enclosing hills recede into the distance; above all,  to the middle tract belongs the open space of the Fayoum nearly fifty  miles across in its greatest diameter, and containing an area of four  hundred square miles. Hence, with some of the occupants of Egypt a  triple division has been preferred to a twofold one, the Greeks  interposing the \"Heptanomis\" between the Thebais and the Delta, and the  Arabs the \"Vostani\" between the Said and the Bahari, or \"country of the  sea.\"    It may be objected to this description, that the Egypt which it presents  to the reader is not the Egypt of the maps. Undoubtedly it is not. The  maps give the name of Egypt to a broad rectangular space which they mark  out in the north-eastern corner of Africa, bounded on two sides by the  Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and on the two others by two imaginary  lines which the map-makers kindly draw for us across the sands of the  desert. But \"this Egypt,\" as has been well observed, \"is a fiction of  the geographers, as untrue to fact as the island Atlantis of Greek  legend, or the Lyonnesse of mediaeval romance, both sunk beneath the  ocean to explain their disappearance. The true Egypt of the old  monuments, of the Hebrews, of the Greeks and Romans, of the Arabs, and  of its own people in this day, is a mere fraction of this vast area of  the maps, nothing more than the valley and plain watered by the Nile,  for nearly seven hundred miles by the river's course from the  Mediterranean southwards.\"[1] The great wastes on either side of the  Nile valley are in no sense Egypt, neither the undulating sandy desert  to the west, nor the rocky and gravelly highland to the east, which  rises in terrace after terrace to a height, in some places, of six  thousand feet. Both are sparsely inhabited, and by tribes of a different  race from the Egyptian--tribes whose allegiance to the rulers of Egypt  is in the best times nominal, and who for the most part spurn the very  idea of submission to authority.    If, then, the true Egypt be the tract that we have described--the Nile  valley, with the Fayoum and the Delta--the lily stalk, the bud, and the  blossom--we can well understand how it came to be said of old, that  \"Egypt was the gift of the river.\" Not that the lively Greek, who first  used the expression, divined exactly the scientific truth of the matter.  The fancy of Herodotus saw Africa, originally, _doubly_ severed from  Asia by two parallel _fjords_, one running inland northwards from the  Indian Ocean, as the Red Sea does to this day, and the other penetrating  inland southwards from the Mediterranean to an equal or greater  distance! The Nile, he said, pouring itself into this latter _fjord_,  had by degrees filled it up, and had then gone on and by further  deposits turned into land a large piece of the \"sea of the Greeks,\" as  was evident from the projection of the shore of the Delta beyond the  general coast-line of Africa eastward and westward; and, he added, \"I am  convinced, for my own part, that if the Nile should please to divert his  waters from their present bed into the Red Sea, he would fill it up and  turn it into dry land in the space of twenty thousand years, or maybe in  half that time--for he is a mighty river and a most energetic one.\"  Here, in this last expression, he is thoroughly right, though the method  of the Nile's energy has been other than he supposed. The Nile, working  from its immense reservoirs in the equatorial regions, has gradually  scooped itself out a deep bed in the sand and rock of the desert, which  must have originally extended across the whole of northern Africa from  the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Having scooped itself out this bed to a  depth, in places, of three hundred feet from the desert level, it has  then proceeded partially to fill it up with its own deposits. Occupying,  when it is at its height, the entire bed, and presenting at that time  the appearance of a vast lake, or succession of lakes, it deposes every  day a portion of sediment over the whole space which it covers: then,  contracting gradually, it leaves at the base of the hills, on both  sides, or at any rate on one, a strip of land fresh dressed with mud,  which gets wider daily as the waters still recede, until yards grow into  furlongs, and furlongs into miles, and at last the shrunk stream is  content with a narrow channel a few hundred yards in width, and leaves  the rest of its bed to the embraces of sun and air, and, if he so wills,  to the industry of man. The land thus left exposed is Egypt--Egypt is  the temporarily uncovered bed of the Nile, which it reclaims and  recovers during a portion of each year, when Egypt disappears from view,  save where human labour has by mounds and embankments formed artificial  islands that raise their heads above the waste of waters, for the most  part crowned with buildings.    There is one exception to this broad and sweeping statement. The Fayoum  is no part of the natural bed of the Nile, and has not been scooped out  by its energy. It is a natural depression in the western desert,  separated off from the Nile valley by a range of limestone hills from  two hundred to five hundred feet in height, and, apart from the activity  of man, would have been arid, treeless, and waterless. Still, it derives  from the Nile all its value, all its richness, all its fertility. Human  energy at some remote period introduced into the depressed tract through  an artificial channel from the Nile, cut in some places through the  rock, the life-giving fluid; and this fluid, bearing the precious Nile  sediment, has sufficed to spread fertility over the entire region, and  to make the desert blossom like a garden.    The Egyptians were not unaware of the source of their blessings. From a  remote date they speculated on their mysterious river. They deified it  under the name of Hapi, \"the Hidden,\" they declared that \"his abode was  not known;\" that he was an inscrutable god, that none could tell his  origin: they acknowledged him as the giver of all good things, and  especially of the fruits of the earth. They said--        \"Hail to thee, O Nile!      Thou showest thyself in this land,      Coming in peace, giving life to Egypt;      O Ammon, thou leadest night unto day,      A leading that rejoices the heart!

(Historian).    d. _The Silver Latinity_, from the death of Augustus (14 A.D.) to the death  of Marcus Aurelius (180 A.D.), This period is marked by a certain reaction  against the excessive precision of the previous age. It had become the  practice to pay too much attention to standardized forms of expression, and  to leave too little play to the individual writer. In the healthy reaction  against this formalism, greater freedom of expression now manifests itself.  We note also the introduction of idioms from the colloquial language, along  with many poetical words and usages. The following authors deserve mention:      Phaedrus, flourished about 40 A.D. (Fables in Verse)    Velleius Paterculus, flourished about 30 A.D. (Historian).    Lucan, 39-65 A.D. (Poem on the Civil War).    Seneca, about 1-65 A.D. (Tragedies; Philosophical Works).

(\"Metamorphoses,\" or \"Golden Ass\").    e. _The Archaizing Period._ This period is characterized by a conscious  imitation of the Archaic Period of the second and first centuries B.C.; it  overlaps the preceding period, and is of importance from a linguistic  rather than from a literary point of view. Of writers who manifest the  archaizing tendency most conspicuously may be mentioned Fronto, from whose  hand we have a collection of letters addressed to the Emperors Antoninus  Pius and Marcus Aurelius; also Aulus Gellius, author of the \"Attic Nights.\"  Both of these writers flourished in the second half of the second century  A.D.    f. _The Period of the Decline_, from 180 to the close of literary activity  in the sixth century A.D. This period is characterized by rapid and radical  alterations in the language. The features of the conversational idiom of  the lower strata of society invade the literature, while in the remote  provinces, such as Gaul, Spain, Africa, the language suffers from the  incorporation of local peculiarities. Representative writers of this period  are:      Tertullian, about 160-about 240 A.D. (Christian Writer).    Cyprian, about 200-258 A.D. (Christian Writer).    Lactantius, flourished about 300 A.D. (Defense of Christianity).    Ausonius, about 310-about 395 A.D. (Poet).    Jerome, 340-420 A.D. (Translator of the Scriptures).    Ambrose, about 340-397 (Christian Father).    Augustine, 354-430 (Christian Father--\"City of God\").    Prudentius, flourished 400 A.D. (Christian Poet).    Claudian, flourished 400 A.D. (Poet).    Boethius, about 480-524 A.D. (\"Consolation of Philosophy \").    4. Subsequent History of the Latin Language.--After the sixth century A.D.  Latin divides into two entirely different streams. One of these is the  literary language maintained in courts, in the Church, and among scholars.  This was no longer the language of people in general, and as time went on,  became more and more artificial. The other stream is the colloquial idiom  of the common people, which developed ultimately in the provinces into the  modern so-called Romance idioms. These are the Italian, Spanish,  Portuguese, French, Provencal (spoken in Provence, i.e. southeastern  France), the Rhaeto-Romance (spoken in the Canton of the Grisons in  Switzerland), and the Roumanian, spoken in modern Roumania and adjacent  districts. All these Romance languages bear the same relation to the Latin  as the different groups of the Indo-European family of languages bear to  the parent speech.           *       *       *       *       *    PART I.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUNDS, ACCENT, QUANTITY.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ALPHABET.    1. The Latin Alphabet is the same as the English, except that the Latin has  no w.    1. K occurs only in _Kalendae_ and a few other words; y and z were  introduced from the Greek about 50 B.C., and occur only in foreign  words--chiefly Greek.    2. With the Romans, who regularly employed only capitals, I served both as  vowel and consonant; so also V. For us, however, it is more convenient to  distinguish the vowel and consonant sounds, and to write i and u for the  former, j and v for the latter. Yet some scholars prefer to employ i and u  in the function of consonants as well as vowels.    CLASSIFICATION OF SOUNDS.    2. 1. The Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y. The other letters are Consonants.  The Diphthongs are ae, oe, ei, au, eu, ui.    2. Consonants are further subdivided into Mutes, Liquids, Nasals, and  Spirants.    3. The Mutes are p, t, c, k, q; b, d, g; ph, th, ch. Of these,--      a) p, t, c, k, q are voiceless,[4] i.e. sounded _without_ voice or    vibration of the vocal cords.      b) b, d, g are voiced,[5] i.e. sounded _with_ vibration of the vocal    cords.      c) ph, th, ch are aspirates. These are confined almost exclusively to    words derived from the Greek, and were equivalent to p + h, t + h, c + h,    i.e. to the corresponding voiceless mutes with a following breath, as in    Eng. _loop-hole_, _hot-house_, _block-house_.    4. The Mutes admit of classification also as      Labials,                        p, b, ph.    Dentals (or Linguals),          t, d, th.    Gutturals (or Palatals),        c, k, q, g, ch.    5. The Liquids are l, r. These sounds were voiced.    6. The Nasals are m, n. These were voiced. Besides its ordinary sound, n,  when followed by a guttural mute also had another sound,--that of ng in  _sing_,--the so-called n _adulterinum_; as,--      anceps, _double_, pronounced angceps.    7. The Spirants (sometimes called Fricatives) are f, s, h. These were  voiceless.    8. The Semivowels are j and v. These were voiced.    9. Double Consonants are x and z. Of these, x was equivalent to cs, while  the equivalence of z is uncertain. See Sec. 3, 3.    10. The following table will indicate the relations of the consonant  sounds:--                     VOICELESS.     VOICED.      ASPIRATES.                       p,            b,           ph,       (Labials).    Mutes,             t,            d,           th,       (Dentals).                    c, k, q,         g,           ch,       (Gutturals).    Liquids,                       l, r,    Nasals,                        m, n,                       f,                                   (Labial).    Spirants,          s,                                   (Dental).                       h,                                   (Guttural).    Semivowels,                    j, v.      a. The Double Consonants, x and z, being compound sounds, do not admit of    classification in the above table.    SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.    3. The following pronunciation (often called Roman) is substantially that  employed by the Romans at the height of their civilization; i.e., roughly,  from 50 B.C. to 50 A.D.    1. Vowels.      a as in _father_;          a as in the first syllable _aha_;    e as in _they_;            e as in _met_;    i as in _machine_;         i as in _pin_;    o as in _note_;            o as in _obey_, _melody_;    u as in _rude_;            u as in _put_;    y like French _u_, German    _ue_.    2. Diphthongs.      ae like _ai_ in            eu with its two elements, e and u,    _aisle_;                   pronounced in rapid succession;    oe like _oi_ in _oil_;     ui occurs almost exclusively in    ei as in _rein_;           _cui_ and _huic_. These words may    au like _ow_ in _how_;     be pronounced as  though written                               _kwee_ and _wheek_.    3. Consonants.      b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, qu are pronounced as in English, except that    bs, bt are pronounced _ps_, _pt_.      c is always pronounced as _k_.      t is always a plain _t_, never with the sound of _sh_ as in Eng.    _oration_.      g always as in _get_; when ngu precedes a vowel, gu has the sound of    _gw_, as in anguis, languidus.      j has the sound of _y_ as in _yet_.      r was probably slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.      s always voiceless as in _sin_; in suadeo, suavis, suesco, and in    compounds and derivatives of these words, su has the sound of _sw_.      v like _w_.      x always like _ks_; never like Eng. _gz_ or _z_.      z uncertain in sound; possibly like Eng. _zd_, possibly like _z_. The    latter sound is recommended.      The aspirates ph, ch, th were pronounced very nearly like our stressed    Eng. _p_, c, _t_--so nearly so, that, for practical purposes, the latter    sounds suffice.      Doubled letters, like ll, mm, tt, etc., should be so pronounced that both    members of the combination are distinctly articulated.    SYLLABLES.    4. There are as many syllables in a Latin word as there are separate vowels  and diphthongs.    In the division of words into syllables,--    1. A single consonant is joined to the following vowel; as, vo-lat, ge-rit,  pe-rit, a-dest.    2. Doubled consonants, like tt, ss, etc., are always separated; as, vit-ta,  mis-sus.    3. Other combinations of two or more consonants are regularly separated,  and the first consonant of the combination is joined with the preceding  vowel; as, ma-gis-tri, dig-nus,"]]]
