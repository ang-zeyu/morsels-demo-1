He underestimated his adversary's resources, for the burglar, retreating  with a look of surrender, came within reach of the electric light,  turned it off, and fled in the total darkness that followed. Geoffrey  sprang to the switch, but the few seconds that his fingers were fumbling  for it told against him. When he turned it on the room was empty. The  door by which the thief had gone opened on the main hall and not on the  passageway, so that Geoffrey still had time to secure the outer door.  Next he lit the chandelier in the hall, but its illumination told  nothing. It was Geoffrey's own sharp ears that told him of light  footsteps beyond the turn of the stairs. Here Holland recognised at once  that the burglar had a great advantage. The flight of stairs from the  hall reached the upper story at a point very near where the back stairs  came up, while they descended to widely different places in the lower  story, so that the burglar, looking down, could choose his flight of  stairs as soon as he saw his pursuer committed to the other, and thus  reach the lower hall with several seconds to spare. Fortunately,  however, Geoffrey remembered that there was a door at the foot of the  back stairs. With incredible quickness he turned off the light again,  threw his boots upstairs in the ingenious hope that the sound would give  the effect of his own ascent, dashed round and locked the door at the  foot of the stairs and then at the top of his speed ran up the front  stairs and down the back. The result was somewhat as he expected. The  burglar had reached the door at the foot of the stairs, and finding it  locked was half way up again when he and Geoffrey met. The impetus of  Geoffrey's descent carried the man backward. They both landed against  the locked door with a force that burst it open. Geoffrey, on top and  armed, had little difficulty in securing his bruised foe, and marching  him back to the library where he now took the precaution of locking all  the doors.    Geoffrey, who had felt himself tingling with excitement and the natural  love of the chase, now had time to wonder what he was going to do with  his capture. He thought of the darkness, the storm, the absence of the  two undermen, and the helplessness of the McFarlanes. Then he remembered  the telephone, which, fortunately, stood in a closet off the library.    He turned to the burglar. \"Stand with your face to the wall and your  hands up,\" he said; \"and if I see you move I'd just as lief shoot you as  look at you,\" with which warning he approached the telephone and, still  keeping an eye on the other, rang up central. There was no answer. He  rang again,--six, seven times he repeated the process unavailingly. He  tried the private wire to the McFarlane cottage with no better result.    At this point the burglar spoke.    \"Oh, what the devil!\" he said mildly; \"I can't stand here with my hands  over my head all night.\"    \"You'll stand there,\" replied Geoffrey with some temper, \"until I'm  ready for you to move.\"    \"And when will that be?\"    \"When this fool of a Central answers.\"    \"Oh, not as long as that, I hope,\" said the burglar, \"because, to tell  the truth, I always cut the telephone wires before I enter a house.\"    There was a pause in which it was well Geoffrey did not see the artless  smile of satisfaction which wreathed the burglar's face. At length  Geoffrey said:    \"In that case you might as well sit down, for we seem likely to stay  here until morning.\" He calculated that by that time, Mrs. McFarlane,  alarmed at his absence, would send some one to look for him,--some one  who could be used as a messenger to fetch the constable.    To this suggestion the burglar appeared to acquiesce, for he sank at  once into an armchair--an armchair toward which Holland himself was  making his way, knowing it to be the most comfortable for an all-night  session. Feeling the absurdity of making any point of the matter,  however, he contented himself with the sofa.    \"Take off your mask,\" he said as he sat down.    \"So I will, thank you,\" said the burglar as if he had been asked to  remove his hat, and with his left hand he slipped it off. The face that  met Geoffrey's interested gaze was thin, yet ruddy, and tanned by  exposure so that his very light brilliant eyes flared oddly in so dark a  surrounding. Above, his sandy hair, which had receded somewhat from his  forehead, curled up from his temples like a baby's. His upper lip was  long and with a pleasant mouth gave his face an expression of humour.  His hands were ugly, but small.    They sat for some time without moving, the burglar engaged in bandaging  the cut on his right hand with obvious indifference to Holland's  presence, Geoffrey meanwhile studying him carefully. The process of  bandaging over, the man reached out his hand toward the bookcase and,  selecting a volume of Sterne, settled back comfortably in his chair.  Holland stared at him an instant in wonder, and then attempted to follow  his example. But his attention to his book was much less concentrated  than that of his captive, whose expression soon showed him to be  completely absorbed.    They must have sat thus for an hour, before the burglar began to show  signs of restlessness. He asked if it were still snowing, and looked  distinctly disturbed on being told it was. At last he broke the silence  again.    \"You don't remember me, do you?\" he said.    Geoffrey slowly raised his eyes without moving--his revolver was  drooping in his right hand. He ran his mind over his criminal  acquaintance unsuccessfully, and repeated:    \"Remember you?\"    \"Yes, we were at school together for a time.\"    Geoffrey stared, and then exclaimed spontaneously:    \"You used to be able to wag your ears.\"    \"Can still.\"    \"Why, you are Skinny McVay.\"    The man nodded. Neither was without a sense of humour, and yet saw  nothing comic in these untender reminiscences.    \"I remember the masters all hated you,\" said Geoffrey, \"but you were  straight enough then, weren't you?\"    Again the man nodded. \"I took to this sort of thing a month or so ago.\"    After a moment Geoffrey said:    \"Did not I hear you were in the navy?\"    \"No,\" said McVay. \"I was at Annapolis for a few months. I had an idea I  should like the navy, but Heavens above! I could not stand the Academy.  They threw me out. It seems I had broken every rule they had ever made.  It was worse than State's prison.\"    \"Are you in a position to judge?\" asked Geoffrey coolly.    \"No,\" said McVay, as if he nevertheless had information on the subject.    \"Well, you will be soon,\" said Holland, not sorry for an opportunity to  point out that his heart was not softened by recollections of his school  days. But McVay appeared to ignore this intimation.    \"Yes,\" he said ruminatively; \"I've done a lot of things in my time.\"    \"Well, I don't want to hear about them,\" said Geoffrey, who had no  intention of being drawn into an intimate interchange. The burglar  looked more surprised than angered at this shortness, and only said:    \"Would you have any objection to my putting a match to that fire?\"    \"No,\" said Geoffrey, and McVay, with wonderful dexterity, managed to  start a cheering blaze with his left hand.    For a few minutes Geoffrey's determined attention to his book  discouraged his companion, but presently rapping the pages of Tristram  Shandy with the back of his hand, he exclaimed:    \"Sterne! Ah, there was a man! Something of my own type, too, it  sometimes strikes me. Capable, you know, really a genius, but so  unfortunately different from other people. Ordinary standards meant  nothing to him--too original--sees life from another standpoint,  entirely. That's me! I--\"    \"Sit down,\" roared Geoffrey.    \"Oh, it's nothing, nothing,\" said McVay, \"only I talk better on my  feet.\"    \"Well, you wouldn't talk as well with a bullet in you.\"    McVay sank back again in his chair. \"Yes,\" he said, \"that's me. Why,  Holland, I have no doubt you would be surprised if you knew the number  of things that I can do--that I am really proficient in. Anything with  the hands,\" he waved his fingers supplely in the air, \"is no trouble to  me at all. I have at once a natural skill that most people take a  lifetime to acquire.\"    \"I'm told there's work for all where you are going.\"    McVay looked a trifle puzzled for an instant, but never allowing himself  to remain at a loss, he said:    \"Work! Do you really mean to say that you believe in a utilitarian  Heaven, where we are going to work with our hands? For my part--\"    \"I had reference to the penitentiary,\" said Geoffrey.    \"Oh, yes, of course, the penitentiary. There are some wonderful men in  the penitentiary. You don't admit that, I suppose, with your  conventional ideas; but to me they are just as admirable as any other  great creative artist,--sculptor or financier. I see you don't quite get  that. You are hemmed in by conventional standards, and your possessions,  and all the things to which you attach such great importance.\"    \"I don't attach so much importance that I steal them from other people,\"  said Geoffrey.    \"Philistine, Holland, philistine! Is not any one who has anything  stealing from some one or other? Of course. But I see you don't catch  the idea. Well, I dare say I would not either in your place--rather  think I would not. My sister is just the same way. Sweet girl, witty in  her own way, but philistine. She is so good as to be my companion,  apparently on equal terms, in many ways my superior, but it would be  impossible for me even to mention these ideas to her,--ideas which are  of the greatest interest to me.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Geoffrey, \"how much of all this rubbish you believe?\"    McVay smiled with great sweetness. \"I wonder myself, Holland. Still it  is undeniably amusing, and the main thing is that I enjoy life,--a hard  life too in many ways. Fate has dealt me some sad blows. Look at such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#3)"],[1,"this national menace with every known  system of dieting. For her every meal was a species of torment, and  the procession of bocks in the smoking room a tantalizing agony.  The slenderness achieved and maintained by will power only made more  prominent the size of her frame, the powerful skeleton with heavy jaws  and large teeth, strong and dazzling, which perhaps suggested Desnoyers'  disrespectful comparison. \"She is thin, but enormous, nevertheless!\" was  always his conclusion.    But then, he considered her, notwithstanding, the most distinguished  woman on board--distinguished for the sea--elegant in the style of  Munich, with clothes of indescribable colors that suggested Persian art  and the vignettes of mediaeval manuscripts. The husband admired Bertha's  elegance, lamenting her childlessness in secret, almost as though it  were a crime of high treason. Germany was magnificent because of the  fertility of its women. The Kaiser, with his artistic hyperbole, had  proclaimed that the true German beauty should have a waist measure of at  least a yard and a half.    When Desnoyers entered into the smoking room in order to take the  seat which Bertha had reserved for him, her husband and his wealthy  hangers-on had their pack of cards lying idle upon the green felt. Herr  Rath was continuing his discourse and his listeners, taking their cigars  from their mouths, were emitting grunts of approbation. The arrival of  Julio provoked a general smile of amiability. Here was France coming  to fraternize with them. They knew that his father was French, and  that fact made him as welcome as though he came in direct line from the  palace of the Quai d'Orsay, representing the highest diplomacy of the  Republic. The craze for proselyting made them all promptly concede to  him unlimited importance.    \"We,\" continued the Counsellor looking fixedly at Desnoyers as if he  were expecting a solemn declaration from him, \"we wish to live on good  terms with France.\"    The youth nodded his head so as not to appear inattentive. It appeared  to him a very good thing that these peoples should not be enemies, and  as far as he was concerned, they might affirm this relationship as often  as they wished: the only thing that was interesting him just at  that time was a certain knee that was seeking his under the table,  transmitting its gentle warmth through a double curtain of silk.    \"But France,\" complained the manufacturer, \"is most unresponsive towards  us. For many years past, our Emperor has been holding out his hand with  noble loyalty, but she pretends not to see it. . . . That, you must  admit, is not as it should be.\"    Just here Desnoyers believed that he ought to say something in order  that the spokesman might not divine his more engrossing occupation.    \"Perhaps you are not doing enough. If, first of all, you would return  that which you took away from France!\" . . .    Stupefied silence followed this remark, as if the alarm signal had  sounded through the boat. Some of those who were about putting their  cigars in their mouths, remained with hands immovable within two inches  of their lips, their eyes almost popping out of their heads. But the  Captain of the Landsturm was there to formulate their mute protest.    \"Return!\" he said in a voice almost extinguished by the sudden swelling  of his neck. \"We have nothing to return, for we have taken nothing. That  which we possess, we acquire by our heroism.\"    The hidden knee with its agreeable friction made itself more  insinuating, as though counselling the youth to greater prudence.    \"Do not say such things,\" breathed Bertha, \"thus only the republicans,  corrupted by Paris, talk. A youth so distinguished who has been in  Berlin, and has relatives in Germany!\" . . .    But Desnoyers felt a hereditary impulse of aggressiveness before each  of her husband's statements, enunciated in haughty tones, and responded  coldly:--    \"It is as if I should take your watch and then propose that we should be  friends, forgetting the occurrence. Although you might forget, the first  thing for me to do would be to return the watch.\"    Counsellor Erckmann wished to retort with so many things at once that he  stuttered horribly, leaping from one idea to the other. To compare the  reconquest of Alsace to a robbery. A German country! The race . . . the  language . . . the history! . . .    \"But when did they announce their wish to be German?\" asked the youth  without losing his calmness. \"When have you consulted their opinion?\"    The Counsellor hesitated, not knowing whether to argue with this  insolent fellow or crush him with his scorn.    \"Young man, you do not know what you are talking about,\" he finally  blustered with withering contempt. \"You are an Argentinian and do not  understand the affairs of Europe.\"    And the others agreed, suddenly repudiating the citizenship which  they had attributed to him a little while before. The Counsellor, with  military rudeness, brusquely turned his back upon him, and taking up  the pack, distributed the cards. The game was renewed. Desnoyers, seeing  himself isolated by the scornful silence, felt greatly tempted to break  up the playing by violence; but the hidden knee continued counselling  self-control, and an invisible hand had sought his right, pressing  it sweetly. That was enough to make him recover his serenity. The  Counsellor's Lady seemed to be absorbed in the progress of the game. He  also looked on, a malignant smile contracting slightly the lines of his  mouth as he was mentally ejaculating by way of consolation, \"Captain,  Captain! . . . You little know what is awaiting you!\"    On terra firma, he would never again have approached these men; but life  on a transatlantic liner, with its inevitable promiscuousness, obliges  forgetfulness. The following day the Counsellor and his friends came in  search of him, flattering his sensibilities by erasing every irritating  memory. He was a distinguished youth belonging to a wealthy family, and  all of them had shops and business in his country. The only thing was  that he should be careful not to mention his French origin. He was an  Argentinian; and thereupon, the entire chorus interested itself in the  grandeur of his country and all the nations of South America where they  had agencies or investments--exaggerating its importance as though its  petty republics were great powers, commenting with gravity upon the  deeds and words of its political leaders and giving him to understand  that in Germany there was no one who was not concerned about the  future of South America, predicting for all its divisions most glorious  prosperity--a reflex of the Empire, always, provided, of course, that  they kept under Germanic influence.    In spite of these flatteries, Desnoyers was no longer presenting himself  with his former assiduity at the hour of poker. The Counsellor's wife  was retiring to her stateroom earlier than usual--their approach to the  Equator inducing such an irresistible desire for sleep, that she had  to abandon her husband to his card playing. Julio also had mysterious  occupations which prevented his appearance on deck until after midnight.  With the precipitation of a man who desires to be seen in order to avoid  suspicion, he was accustomed to enter the smoking room talking loudly as  he seated himself near the husband and his boon companions.    The game had ended, and an orgy of beer and fat cigars from Hamburg  was celebrating the success of the winners. It was the hour of Teutonic  expansion, of intimacy among men, of heavy, sluggish jokes, of off-color  stories. The Counsellor was presiding with much majesty over the  diableries of his chums, prudent business men from the Hanseatic ports  who had big accounts in the Deutsche Bank or were shopkeepers installed  in the republic of the La Plata, with an innumerable family. He was a  warrior, a captain, and on applauding every heavy jest with a laugh that  distended his fat neck, he fancied that he was among his comrades at  arms.    In honor of the South Americans who, tired of pacing the deck, had  dropped in to hear what the gringoes were saying, they were turning into  Spanish the witticisms and licentious anecdotes awakened in the memory  by a superabundance of beer. Julio was marvelling at the ready laugh of  all these men. While the foreigners were remaining unmoved, they would  break forth into loud horse-laughs throwing themselves back in their  seats. And when the German audience was growing cold, the story-teller  would resort to an infallible expedient to remedy his lack of success:--    \"They told this yarn to the Kaiser, and when the Kaiser heard it he  laughed heartily.\"    It was not necessary to say more. They all laughed then. Ha, ha, ha!  with a spontaneous roar but a short one, a laugh in three blows, since  to prolong it, might be interpreted as a lack of respect to His Majesty.    As they neared Europe, a batch of news came to meet the boat. The  employees in the wireless telegraphy office were working incessantly.  One night, on entering the smoking room, Desnoyers saw the German  notables gesticulating with animated countenances. They were no longer  drinking beer. They had had bottles of champagne uncorked, and the  Counsellor's Lady, much impressed, had not retired to her stateroom.  Captain Erckmann, spying the young Argentinian, offered him a glass.    \"It is war,\" he shouted with enthusiasm. \"War at last. . . . The hour  has come!\"    Desnoyers made a gesture of astonishment. War! . . . What war? . . .  Like all the others, he had read on the news bulletin outside  a radiogram stating that the Austrian government had just sent an  ultimatum to Servia; but it made not the slightest impression on him,  for he was not at all interested in the Balkan affairs. Those were but  the quarrels of a miserable little nation monopolizing the attention of  the world, distracting it from more"]]]
