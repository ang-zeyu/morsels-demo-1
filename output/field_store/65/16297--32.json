He had failed because his  mind was so full of Grandfather Frog and Longlegs that he forgot to look  around, as he usually does. Just skimming the tops of the bulrushes he  sailed swiftly out over the Smiling Pool and reached down with his  great, cruel claws to clutch Grandfather Frog, who sat there pretending  to be asleep, but all the time watching Longlegs and deep down inside  chuckling to think how he was fooling Longlegs.    Slap! That was the tail of Jerry Muskrat hitting the water. Grandfather  Frog knew what that meant--danger! He didn't know what the danger was,  and he didn't wait to find out. There would be time enough for that  later. When Jerry Muskrat slapped the water with his tail that way,  danger was very near indeed. With a frightened \"Chugarum!\" Grandfather  Frog dived head first into the Smiling Pool, and so close was old  Whitetail that the water was splashed right in his face. He clutched  frantically with his great claws, but all he got was a piece of the big  green lily-pad on which Grandfather Frog had been sitting, and of course  this was of no use for an empty stomach.    With a scream of disappointment and anger, he whirled in the air and  made straight for Jerry Muskrat. But Jerry just laughed in the most  provoking way and ducked under water.          VI    LONGLEGS AND WHITETAIL QUARREL      \"You did!\" \"I didn't! I didn't!\" \"You did!\"    Such a terrible fuss when Grandfather hid!      You see Longlegs the Blue Heron had stood very patiently on one foot all  the long morning waiting for Grandfather Frog to go to sleep on his big  green lily-pad. He had felt sure he was to have Grandfather Frog for his  breakfast and lunch, for he had had no breakfast, and it was now lunch  time. He was so hungry that it seemed to him that the sides of his  stomach certainly would fall in because there was nothing to hold them  up, and then, without any warning at all, old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk  had glided out across the Smiling Pool with his great claws stretched  out to clutch Grandfather Frog, and Grandfather Frog had dived into the  Smiling Pool with a great splash just in the very nick of time.    Now is there anything in the world so hard on the temper as to lose a  good meal when you are very, very, very hungry? Of course Longlegs  didn't really have that good meal, but he had thought that he was surely  going to have it. So when Grandfather Frog splashed into the Smiling  Pool, of course Longlegs lost his temper altogether. His yellow eyes  seemed to grow even more yellow.    \"You robber! You thief!\" he screamed harshly at old Whitetail.    Now old Whitetail was just as hungry as Longlegs, and he had come even  nearer to catching Grandfather Frog. He is even quicker tempered than  Longlegs. He had whirled like a flash on Jerry Muskrat, but Jerry had  just laughed in the most provoking manner and ducked under water. This  had made old Whitetail angrier than ever, and then to be called bad  names--robber and thief! It was more than any self-respecting Hawk could  stand. Yes, Sir, it certainly was! He fairly shook with rage as he  turned in the air once more and made straight for Longlegs the Blue  Heron.    \"I'm no more robber and thief than you are!\" he shrieked.    \"You frightened away my Frog!\" screamed Longlegs.    \"I didn't!\"    \"You did!\"    \"I didn't! It wasn't your Frog; it was mine!\"    \"Chugarum!\" said Grandfather Frog to Jerry Muskrat, as they peeped out  from under some lily-pads. \"I didn't know I belonged to anybody. I  really didn't. Did you?\"    \"No,\" replied Jerry, his eyes sparkling with excitement as he watched  Longlegs and Whitetail, \"it's news to me.\"    \"You're too lazy to hunt like honest people!\" taunted old Whitetail, as  he wheeled around Longlegs, watching for a chance to strike with his  great, cruel claws.    \"I'm too honest to take the food out of other people's mouths!\" retorted  Longlegs, dancing around so as always to face Whitetail, one of his  great, broad wings held in front of him like a shield, and his long,  strong bill ready to strike.    Every feather on Whitetail's head was standing erect with rage, and he  looked very fierce and terrible. At last he saw a chance, or thought he  did, and shot down. But all he got was a feather from that great wing  which Longlegs kept in front of him, and before he could get away, that  long bill had struck him twice, so that he screamed with pain. So they  fought and fought, till the ground was covered with feathers, and they  were too tired to fight any longer. Then, slowly and painfully, old  Whitetail flew away over the Green Meadows, and with torn and ragged  wings, Longlegs flew heavily down the Laughing Brook towards the Big  River, and both were sore and stiff and still hungry.    \"Dear me! Dear me! What a terrible thing and how useless anger is,\" said  Grandfather Frog, as he climbed back on his big green lily-pad in the  warm sunshine.          VII    GRANDFATHER FROG'S BIG MOUTH GETS HIM IN TROUBLE      Grandfather Frog has a great big mouth. You know that. Everybody does.  His friends of the Smiling Pool, the Laughing Brook, and the Green  Meadows have teased Grandfather Frog a great deal about the size of his  mouth, but he hasn't minded in the least, not the very least. You see,  he learned a long time ago that a big mouth is very handy for catching  foolish green flies, especially when two happen to come along together.  So he is rather proud of his big mouth, just as he is of his goggly  eyes.    But once in a while his big mouth gets him into trouble. It's a way big  mouths have. It holds so much that it makes him greedy sometimes. He  stuffs it full after his stomach already has all that it can hold, and  then of course he can't swallow. Then Grandfather Frog looks very  foolish and silly and undignified, and everybody calls him a greedy  fellow who is old enough to know better and who ought to be ashamed of  himself. Perhaps he is, but he never says so, and he is almost sure to  do the same thing over again the first chance he has.    Now it happened that one morning when Grandfather Frog had had a very  good breakfast of foolish green flies and really didn't need another  single thing to eat, who should come along but Little Joe Otter, who had  been down to the Big River fishing. He had eaten all he could hold, and  he was taking the rest of his catch to a secret hiding-place up the  Laughing Brook.    Now Grandfather Frog is very fond of fish for a change, and when he saw  those that Little Joe Otter had, his eyes glistened, and in spite of his  full stomach his mouth watered.    \"Good morning, Grandfather Frog! Have you had your breakfast yet?\"  called Little Joe Otter.    Grandfather Frog wanted to say no, but he always tells the truth.  \"Ye-e-s,\" he replied. \"I've had my breakfast, such as it was. Why do you  ask?\"    \"Oh, for no reason in particular. I just thought that if you hadn't, you  might like a fish. But as long as you have breakfasted, of course you  don't want one,\" said Little Joe, his bright eyes beginning to twinkle.  He held the fish out so that Grandfather Frog could see just how plump  and nice they were.    \"Chugarum!\" exclaimed Grandfather Frog. \"Those certainly are very nice  fish, very nice fish indeed. It is very nice of you to think of a poor  old fellow like me, and I--er--well, I might find room for just a little  teeny, weeny one, if you can spare it.\"    Little Joe Otter knows all about Grandfather Frog's greediness. He  looked at Grandfather Frog's white and yellow waistcoat and saw how it  was already stuffed full to bursting. The twinkle in his eyes grew more  mischievous than ever as he said: \"Of course I can. But I wouldn't think  of giving such an old friend a teeny, weeny one.\"    With that, Little Joe picked out the biggest fish he had and tossed it  over to Grandfather Frog. It landed close by his nose with a great  splash, and it was almost half as big as Grandfather Frog himself. It  was plump and looked so tempting that Grandfather Frog forgot all about  his full stomach. He even forgot to be polite and thank Little Joe  Otter. He just opened his great mouth and seized the fish. Yes, Sir,  that is just what he did. Almost before you could wink an eye, the fish  had started down Grandfather Frog's throat head first.    Now you know Grandfather Frog has no teeth, and so he cannot bite things  in two. He has to swallow them whole. That is just what he started to do  with the fish. It went all right until the head reached his stomach. But  you can't put anything more into a thing already full, and Grandfather  Frog's stomach was packed as full as it could be of foolish green flies.  There the fish stuck, and gulp and swallow as hard as he could,  Grandfather Frog couldn't make that fish go a bit farther. Then he tried  to get it out again, but it had gone so far down his throat that he  couldn't get it back. Grandfather Frog began to choke.          VIII    SPOTTY THE TURTLE PLAYS DOCTOR      Greed's a dreadful thing to see,    As everybody will agree.      At first Little Joe Otter, sitting on the bank of the Smiling Pool,  laughed himself almost sick as he watched Grandfather Frog trying to  swallow a fish almost as big as himself, when his white and yellow  waistcoat was already stuffed so full of foolish green flies that there  wasn't room for anything more. Such greed would have been disgusting, if  it hadn't been so very, very funny. At least, it was funny at first, for  the fish had stuck, with the tail hanging out of Grandfather Frog's big  mouth. Grandfather Frog hitched this way and hitched that way on his  big green lily-pad, trying his best to swallow. Twice he tumbled off  with a splash into the Smiling Pool. Each time he scrambled back again  and rolled his great goggly eyes in silent appeal to Little Joe Otter to  come to his aid.    [Illustration: As soon as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#3)"],[1,"a volume of solemn poetry.\"  But our adept omits saying  that one or two degrees higher, and he will have to submit for a period  of years to such a mummifying process unless, indeed, he would  voluntarily give up a life-long labour and--Die.--Ed.  ----------    They may at times have exercised powers which the world called  miraculous;  they may have electrified man and subdued Nature by fiery  and self-devoted Will;  they may have been possessed of a so-called  superhuman intelligence;  they may have even had knowledge of, and  communion with, members of our own occult Brotherhood;  but, having  deliberately resolved to devote their vital energy to the welfare of  others, rather than to themselves, they have surrendered life;  and,  when perishing on the cross or the scaffold, or falling, sword in hand,  upon the battle-field, or sinking exhausted after a successful  consummation of the life-object, on death-beds in their chambers, they  have all alike had to cry out at last:  \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani!\"    So far so good.  But, given the will to live, however powerful, we have  seen that, in the ordinary course of mundane life, the throes of  dissolution cannot be checked.  The desperate, and again and again  renewed struggle of the Kosmic elements to proceed with a career of  change despite the will that is checking them, like a pair of runaway  horses struggling against the determined driver holding them in, are so  cumulatively powerful, that the utmost efforts of the untrained human  will acting within an unprepared body become ultimately useless.  The  highest intrepidity of the bravest soldier;  the interest desire of the  yearning lover;  the hungry greed of the unsatisfied miser;  the most  undoubting faith of the sternest fanatic;  the practiced insensibility  to pain of the hardiest red Indian brave or half-trained Hindu Yogi;  the most deliberate philosophy of the calmest thinker--all alike fail at  last.  Indeed, sceptics will allege in opposition to the verities of  this article that, as a matter of experience, it is often observed that  the mildest and most irresolute of minds and the weakest of physical  frames are often seen to resist \"Death\" longer than the powerful will of  the high-spirited and obstinately-egotistic man, and the iron frame of  the labourer, the warrior and the athlete.  In reality, however, the key  to the secret of these apparently contradictory phenomena is the true  conception of the very thing we have already said.  If the physical  development of the gross \"outer shell\" proceeds on parallel lines and at  an equal rate with that of the will, it stands to reason that no  advantage for the purpose of overcoming it, is attained by the latter.  The acquisition of improved breechloaders by one modern army confers no  absolute superiority if the enemy also becomes possessed of them.  Consequently it will be at once apparent, to those who think on the  subject, that much of the training by which what is known as \"a powerful  and determined nature,\" perfects itself for its own purpose on the stage  of the visible world, necessitating and being useless without a parallel  development of the \"gross\" and so-called animal frame, is, in short,  neutralized, for the purpose at present treated of, by the fact that its  own action has armed the enemy with weapons equal to its own.  The force  of the impulse to dissolution is rendered equal to the will to oppose  it;  and being cumulative, subdues the will-power and triumphs at last.  On the other hand, it may happen that an apparently weak and vacillating  will-power residing in a weak and undeveloped physical frame, may be so  reinforced by some unsatisfied desire--the Ichcha (wish)--as it is  called by the Indian Occultists (for instance, a mother's heart-yearning  to remain and support her fatherless children)--as to keep down and  vanquish, for a short time, the physical throes of a body to which it  has become temporarily superior.    The whole rationale then, of the first condition of continued existence  in this world, is (a) the development of a Will so powerful as to  overcome the hereditary (in a Darwinian sense) tendencies of the atoms  composing the \"gross\" and palpable animal frame, to hurry on at a  particular period in a certain course of Kosmic change;  and (b) to so  weaken the concrete action of that animal frame as to make it more  amenable to the power of the Will.  To defeat an army, you must  demoralize and throw it into disorder.    To do this then, is the real object of all the rites, ceremonies, fasts,  \"prayers,\" meditations, initiations and procedures of self-discipline  enjoined by various esoteric Eastern sects, from that course of pure and  elevated aspiration which leads to the higher phases of Adeptism Real,  down to the fearful and disgusting ordeals which the adherent of the  \"Left-hand-Road\" has to pass through, all the time maintaining his  equilibrium.  The procedures have their merits and their demerits, their  separate uses and abuses, their essential and non-essential parts, their  various veils, mummeries, and labyrinths.  But in all, the result aimed  at is reached, if by different processes.  The Will is strengthened,  encouraged and directed, and the elements opposing its action are  demoralized.  Now, to any one who has thought out and connected the  various evolution theories, as taken, not from any occult source, but  from the ordinary scientific manual accessible to all--from the  hypothesis of the latest variation in the habits of species--say, the  acquisition of carnivorous habits by the New Zealand parrot, for  instance--to the farthest glimpses backwards into Space and Eternity  afforded by the \"Fire Mist\" doctrine, it will be apparent that they all  rest on one basis. That basis is, that the impulse once given to a  hypothetical Unit has a tendency to continue;  and consequently, that  anything \"done\" by something at a certain time and certain place tends  to repeat itself at other times and places.    Such is the admitted rationale of heredity and atavism.  That the same  things apply to our ordinary conduct is apparent from the notorious ease  with which \"habits,\"--bad or good, as the case may be--are acquired, and  it will not be questioned that this applies, as a rule, as much to the  moral and intellectual, as to the physical world.    Furthermore, History and Science teach us plainly that certain physical  habits conduce to certain moral and intellectual results.  There never  yet was a conquering nation of vegetarians. Even in the old Aryan times,  we do not learn that the very Rishis, from whose lore and practice we  gain the knowledge of Occultism, ever interdicted the Kshetriya  (military) caste from hunting or a carnivorous diet.  Filling, as they  did, a certain place in the body politic in the actual condition of the  world, the Rishis as little thought of interfering with them, as of  restraining the tigers of the jungle from their habits.  That did not  affect what the Rishis did themselves.    The aspirant to longevity then must be on his guard against two dangers.  He must beware especially of impure and animal* thoughts. For Science  shows that thought is dynamic, and the thought-force evolved by nervous  action expanding outwardly, must affect the molecular relations of the  physical man.  The inner men,** however sublimated their organism may  be, are still composed of actual, not hypothetical, particles, and are  still subject to the law that an \"action\" has a tendency to repeat  itself;  a tendency to set up analogous action in the grosser \"shell\"  they are in contact with, and concealed within.    ----------  * In other words, the thought tends to provoke the deed.--G.M.    ** We use the word in the plural, reminding the reader that, according  to our doctrine, man is septenary.--G.M.  ----------    And, on the other hand, certain actions have a tendency to produce  actual physical conditions unfavourable to pure thoughts, hence to the  state required for developing the supremacy of the inner man.    To return to the practical process.  A normally healthy mind, in a  normally healthy body, is a good starting-point.  Though exceptionally  powerful and self-devoted natures may sometimes recover the ground lost  by mental degradation or physical misuse, by employing proper means,  under the direction of unswerving resolution, yet often things may have  gone so far that there is no longer stamina enough to sustain the  conflict sufficiently long to perpetuate this life;  though what in  Eastern parlance is called the \"merit\" of the effort will help to  ameliorate conditions and improve matters in another.    However this may be, the prescribed course of self-discipline commences  here.  It may be stated briefly that its essence is a course of moral,  mental, and physical development, carried on in parallel lines--one  being useless without the other.  The physical man must be rendered more  ethereal and sensitive;  the mental man more penetrating and profound;  the moral man more self-denying and philosophical.  And it may be  mentioned that all sense of restraint--even if self-imposed--is useless.  Not only is all \"goodness\" that results from the compulsion of physical  force, threats, or bribes (whether of a physical or so-called  \"spiritual\" nature) absolutely useless to the person who exhibits it,  its hypocrisy tending to poison the moral atmosphere of the world, but  the desire to be \"good\" or \"pure,\" to be efficacious must be  spontaneous.  It must be a self-impulse from within, a real preference  for something higher, not an abstention from vice because of fear of the  law:  not a chastity enforced by the dread of Public Opinion;  not a  benevolence exercised through love of praise or dread of consequences in  a hypothetical Future Life.*    ----------  * Col.
