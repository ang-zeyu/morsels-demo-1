[Footnote 12: \"Music and love are the two wings of the soul,\" he wrote  in his _Memoires_.]    But his love was that of a youth who lives in dreams; it was never the  strong, clear-eyed passion of a man who has faced the realities of life,  and who sees the defects as well as the charms of the woman he loves,  Berlioz was in love with love, and lost himself among visions and  sentimental shadows. To the end of his life he remained \"a poor little  child worn out by a love that was beyond him.\"[13] But this man who  lived so wild and adventurous a life expressed his passions with  delicacy; and one finds an almost girlish purity in the immortal love  passages of _Les Troyens_ or the \"_nuit sereine\"_ of _Romeo et  Juliette_. And compare this Virgilian affection with Wagner's sensual  raptures. Does it mean that Berlioz could not love as well as Wagner? We  only know that Berlioz's life was made up of love and its torments. The  theme of a touching passage in the Introduction of the _Symphonic  fantastique_ has been recently identified by M. Julien Tiersot, in his  interesting book,[14] with a romance composed by Berlioz at the age of  twelve, when he loved a girl of eighteen \"with large eyes and pink  shoes\"--Estelle, _Stella mentis, Stella matutina_. These words--perhaps  the saddest he ever wrote--might serve as an emblem of his life, a life  that was a prey to love and melancholy, doomed to wringing of the heart  and awful loneliness; a life lived in a hollow world, among worries that  chilled the blood; a life that was distasteful and had no solace to  offer him in its end.[15] He has himself described this terrible \"_mal  de l'isolement_,\" which pursued him all his life, vividly and  minutely.[16] He was doomed to suffering, or, what was worse, to make  others suffer.    [Footnote 13: _Memoires_, I, 11.]    [Footnote 14: Julien Tiersot, _Hector Berlioz et la societe de son  temps_, 1903, Hachette.]    [Footnote 15: See the _Memoires_, I, 139.]    [Footnote 16: \"I do not know how to describe this terrible sickness....  My throbbing breast seems to be sinking into space; and my heart,  drawing in some irresistible force, feels as though it would expand  until it evaporated and dissolved away. My skin becomes hot and tender,  and flushes from head to foot. I want to cry out to my friends (even  those I do not care for) to help and comfort me, to save me from  destruction, and keep in the life that is ebbing from me. I have no  sensation of impending death in these attacks, and suicide seems  impossible; I do not want to die--far from it, I want very much to live,  to intensify life a thousandfold. It is an excessive appetite for  happiness, which becomes unbearable when it lacks food; and it is only  satisfied by intense delights, which give this great overflow of feeling  an outlet. It is not a state of spleen, though that may follow later ...  spleen is rather the congealing of all these emotions--the block of ice.  Even when I am calm I feel a little of this '_isolement_' on Sundays in  summer, when our towns are lifeless, and everyone is in the country; for  I know that people are enjoying themselves away from me, and I feel  their absence. The _adagio_ of Beethoven's symphonies, certain scenes  from Gluck's _Alceste_ and _Armide_, an air from his Italian opera  _Telemacco_, the Elysian fields of his _Orfeo_, will bring on rather bad  attacks of this suffering; but these masterpieces bring with them also  an antidote--they make one's tears flow, and then the pain is eased. On  the other hand, the _adagio_ of some of Beethoven's sonatas and Gluck's  _Iphigenie en Tauride_ are full of melancholy, and therefore provoke  spleen ... it is then cold within, the sky is grey and overcast with  clouds, the north wind moans dully....\" _(Memoires_, I, 246).]    Who does not know his passion for Henrietta Smithson? It was a sad  story. He fell in love with an English actress who played Juliet (Was it  she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught but a glance of her, and it was  all over with him. He cried out, \"Ah, I am lost!\" He desired her; she  repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he  wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and  its neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep  overcame him wherever it found him--among the sheaves in a field near  Villejuif, in a meadow near Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near  Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a table in the Cafe Cardinal, where he  slept for five hours, to the great alarm of the waiters, who thought he  was dead.[17] Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta,  which he readily believed. Then he despised her, and dishonoured her  publicly in his _Symphonie fantastique_, paying homage in his bitter  resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist, to whom he lost his heart without  delay.    [Footnote 17: _Memoires_, I, 98.]    After a time Henrietta reappeared. She had now lost her youth and her  power; her beauty was waning, and she was in debt. Berlioz's passion was  at once rekindled. This time Henrietta accepted his advances. He made  alterations in his symphony, and offered it to her in homage of his  love. He won her, and married her, with fourteen thousand francs debt.  He had captured his dream--Juliet! Ophelia! What was she really? A  charming Englishwoman, cold, loyal, and sober-minded, who understood  nothing of his passion; and who, from the time she became his wife,  loved him jealously and sincerely, and thought to confine him within the  narrow world of domestic life. But his affections became restive, and he  lost his heart to a Spanish actress (it was always an actress, a  virtuoso, or a part) and left poor Ophelia, and went off with Marie  Recio, the Ines of _Favorite_, the page of _Comte Ory_--a practical,  hardheaded woman, an indifferent singer with a mania for singing. The  haughty Berlioz was forced to fawn upon the directors of the theatre in  order to get her parts, to write flattering notices in praise of her  talents, and even to let her make his own melodies discordant at the  concerts he arranged.[18] It would all be dreadfully ridiculous if this  weakness of character had not brought tragedy in its train.    So the one he really loved, and who always loved him, remained alone,  without friends, in Paris, where she was a stranger. She drooped in  silence and pined slowly away, bedridden, paralysed, and unable to speak  during eight years of suffering. Berlioz suffered too, for he loved her  still and was torn with pity--\"pity, the most painful of all  emotions.\"[19] But of what use was this pity? He left Henrietta to  suffer alone and to die just the same. And, what was worse, as we learn  from Legouve, he let his mistress, the odious Recio, make a scene before  poor Henrietta.[20] Recio told him of it and boasted about what she had  done.    [Footnote 18: \"Isn't it really devilish,\" he said to Legouve, \"tragic  and silly at the same time? I should deserve to go to hell if I wasn't  there already.\"]    [Footnote 19: _Memoires_, II, 335. See the touching passages he wrote on  Henrietta Smithson's death.]    [Footnote 20: \"One day, Henrietta, who was living alone at Montmartre,  heard someone ring the bell, and went to open the door.    \"'Is Mme. Berlioz at home?'    \"'I am Mme. Berlioz.'    \"'You are mistaken; I asked for Mme. Berlioz.'    \"'And I tell you, I am Mme. Berlioz.'    \"'No, you are not. You are speaking of the old Mme. Berlioz, the one who  was abandoned; I am speaking of the young and pretty and loved one.  Well, that is myself!'    \"And Recio went out and banged the door after her.    \"Legouve said to Berlioz, 'Who told you this abominable thing? I suppose  she who did it; and then she boasted about it into the bargain. Why  didn't you turn her out of the house?' 'How could I?' said Berlioz in  broken tones, 'I love her'\" _(Soixante ans de souvenirs_).]    And Berlioz did nothing--\"How could I? I love her.\"    One would be hard upon such a man if one was not disarmed by his own  sufferings. But let us go on. I should have liked to pass over these  traits, but I have no right to; I must show you the extraordinary  feebleness of the man's character. \"Man's character,\" did I say? No, it  was the character of a woman without a will, the victim of her  nerves.[21]    [Footnote 21: From this woman's nature came his love of revenge, \"a  thing needless, and yet necessary,\" he said to his friend Hiller, who,  after having made him write the _Symphonie fantastique_ to spite  Henrietta Smithson, next made him write the wretched fantasia _Euphonia_  to spite Camille Moke, now Mme. Pleyel. One would feel obliged to draw  more attention to the way he often adorned or perverted the truth if one  did not feel it arose from his irrepressible and glowing imagination far  more than from any intention to mislead; for I believe his real nature  to have been a-very straightforward one. I will quote the story of his  friend Crispino, a young countryman from Tivoli, as a characteristic  example. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_ (I, 229): \"One day when Crispino  was lacking in respect I made-him a present of two shirts, a pair of  trousers, and three good kicks behind.\" In a note he added, \"This is a  lie, and is the result of an artist's tendency to aim at effect. I never  kicked Crispino.\" But Berlioz took care afterwards to omit this note.  One attaches as little importance to his other small boasts as to this  one. The errors in the _Memoires_ have been greatly exaggerated; and  besides, Berlioz is the first "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16469"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume II.

After his return from Paris, he was  instructed by his father in history, and other useful branches of  literature, and became, says Wood, a very accomplished gentleman. This  author has written,    1. Poems, 1683, in 8vo. under the title of Castara: they are divided  into three parts under different titles, suitable to their subject.  The first, which was written when he was courting his wife, Lucia, the  beautiful daughter of William Lord Powis, is introduced by a  character, written in prose, of a mistress. The second are copies to  her after marriage, by the character of a wife; after which is a  character of a friend, before several funeral elegies. The third part  consists of divine poems, some of which are paraphrases on several  texts out of Job, and the book of psalms.    2. The Queen of Arragon, a Tragi-Comedy, which play he shewed to  Philip Earl of Pembroke, who having a high opinion of it, caused it to  be acted at court, and afterwards to be published, the contrary to the  author's inclination.    3. Observations on History, Lond. 1641, 8vo.    4. History of Edward IV. Lond. 1640, in a thin folio, written and  published at the desire of King Charles I. which in the opinion of  some critics of that age, was too florid for history, and fell short  of that calm dignity which is peculiar to a good historian, and which  in our nation has never been more happily attained than by the great  Earl of Clarendon and Bishop Burnet. During the civil war, Mr.  Habington, according to Wood, temporized with those in power, and was  not unknown to Oliver Cromwell; but there is no account of his being  raised to any preferment during the Protector's government. He died  the 30th of November, 1654.    We shall present the readers with the prologue to the Queen of  Arragon, acted at Black-Fryars, as a specimen of this author's poetry.      Ere we begin that no man may repent,    Two shillings, and his time, the author sent    The prologue, with the errors of his play,    That who will, may take his money and away.    First for the plot, 'tis no way intricate    By cross deceits in love, nor so high in state,    That we might have given out in our play-bill    This day's the Prince, writ by Nick Machiavil.    The language too is easy, such as fell    Unstudied from his pen; not like a spell    Big with mysterious words, such as inchant    The half-witted, and confound the ignorant.    Then, what must needs, afflict the amourist,    No virgin here, in breeches casts a mist    Before her lover's eyes; no ladies tell    How their blood boils, how high their veins do swell.    But what is worse no baudy mirth is here;    (The wit of bottle-ale, and double beer)    To make the wife of citizen protest,    And country justice swear 'twas a good jest.    Now, Sirs, you have the errors of his wit,    Like, or dislike, at your own perils be't.    Footnote:  1. Wood Athen.

Was the son of Francis Goldsmith, of St. Giles in the Fields in  Middlesex, Esq; was educated under Dr. Nicholas Grey, in  Merchant-Taylor's School, became a gentleman commoner in  Pembroke-College in the beginning of 1629, was soon after translated  to St. John's College, and after he had taken a degree in arts, to  Grey's-Inn, where he studied the common law several years, but other  learning more[1]. Mr. Langbaine says, that he could recover no other  memoirs of this gentleman, but that he lived in the reign of King  Charles the First, and obliged the World with a translation of a play  out of Latin called, Sophompaneas, or the History of Joseph, with  Annotations, a Tragedy, printed 4to. Lond. 1640, and dedicated to the  Right Hon. Henry Lord Marquis of Dorchester. This Drama was written by  the admirable Hugo Grotius, published by him at Amsterdam 1635, and  dedicated to Vossius, Professor of History and Civil Arts in  Amsterdam. He stiles it a Tragedy, notwithstanding it ends  successfully, and quotes for his authority in so doing, AEschilus,  Euripides, and even Vossius, in his own Art of Poetry. Some make it a  Question, whether it be lawful to found a dramatic Poem on any sacred  subject, and some people of tender consciences have murmured against  this Play, and another of the same cast called Christ's Passion; but  let us hear the opinion of Vossius himself, prefixed to this Play. \"I  am of opinion, (says he) it is better to chuse another argument than  sacred. For it agrees not with the majesty of sacred things, to be  made a play and a fable. It is also a work of very dangerous  consequence, to mingle human inventions with things sacred; because  the poet adds uncertainties of his own, sometimes falsities; which is  not only to play with holy things, but also to graft in men's minds  opinions, now and then false. These things have place, especially when  we bring in God, or Christ speaking, or treating of the mysteries of  religion. I will allow more where the history is taken out of the  sacred scriptures; but yet in the nature of the argument is civil, as  the action of David flying from his son Absolom; or of Joseph sold by  his brethren, advanced by Pharaoh to the government of Egypt, and that  dignity adored by, and made known unto his brethren. Of which argument  is Sophompaneas, written by Hugo Grotius, embassador from the Queen of  Sweden to the King of France; which tragedy, I suppose, may be set for  a pattern to him, that would handle an argument from the holy  scriptures.\" This is the opinion of Vossius, and with him all must  agree who admire the truly admirable Samson Agonistes of Milton.    As we have frequently mentioned Grotius, the short account of so great  a man, which is inserted in Langbaine, will not be unpleasing to the  reader.    \"Hugo Grotius, says he, was an honour to his country: he was born in  the year 1583, and will be famous to posterity, in regard of those  many excellent pieces he has published. In some of his writings he  defended Arminianism, for which he suffered imprisonment in the castle  of Louverstein, in the year 1618; at which time his associate  Barnevelt lost his head on the same account. Afterwards Grotius  escaped out of prison, by means of Maria Reigersberg his wife, and  fled into Flanders; and thence into France, where he was kindly  received by Lewis XIII. He died at Rostock in Mecclebourg, Sept. 1,  1645. His life is written at large by Melchoir Adamus, in Latin.\"    As to our outhor's [sic] translation, which is in heroic verse, it is  much commended by verses from four of his friends.    He also translated Grotius's consolatory oration to his father, with  epitaphs; and also his Catechism into English verse.    Mr. Goldsmith died at Ashton in Northamptonshire, in September 1655,  and was buried there, leaving behind him an only daughter named  Katherine, afterwards the wife of Sir Henry Dacres.    Footnote:  1. Wood Athen. Oxon. v. 2. p. 194.                    *        *        *        *        *                                     JOHN CLEVELAND,      Was the son of a vicar of Hinkley, in Leicestershire, where he was  born, and received his grammatical education, under one Mr. Richard  Vines, a zealous Puritan. After he had compleated his school  education, he was sent to Christ's College in Cambridge, and in a  short time distinguishing himself for his knowledge of the Latin  tongue, and for Oratory, he was preferred to a fellowship in St.  John's-College, in the said university. He continued there about nine  years, and made during that time some successful attempts in poetry.  At length, upon the eruption of the civil war, he was the first who  espoused the Royal cause in verse, against the Presbyterians, who  persecuted him in their turn with more solid severity; for he was  ejected, as soon as the reins of power were in their hands. Dr. Fuller  bestows upon our author the most lavish panegyric: He was (says he) a  general artist, pure latinist, an exquisite orator, and what was his  masterpiece, an eminent poet. Dr. Fuller thus characterizes him, but  as Cleveland has not left remains behind him sufficient to convey to  posterity so high an idea of his merit, it may be supposed that the  Doctor spoke thus in his favour, meerly on account of their agreement  in political principles. He addressed an oration, says Winstanley, to  Charles I. who was so well pleased with it, that he sent for him, and  gave him his hand to kiss, with great expressions of kindness. When  Oliver Cromwell was in election to be member for the town of  Cambridge, as he engaged all his friends and interests to oppose it;  so when it was carried but by one vote, he cried out with much  passion, that, that single vote had ruined church and kingdom[1], such  fatal events did he presage from the success of Oliver. Mr. Cleveland  was no sooner forced from the College, by the prevalence of the  Parliament's interest, but he betook himself to the camp, and  particularly to Oxford the head quarters of it, as the most proper  sphere for his wit, learning and loyalty. Here he began a paper war  with the opposite party, and wrote some smart satires against the  Rebels, especially the Scots. His poem called the Mixt Assembly; his  character of a London Diurnal, and a Committee-man, are thought to  contain the true spirit of satire, and a just representation of the  general confusion of the times. From Oxford he went to the garrison of  Newark, where he acted as judge advocate till that garrison was  surrendered, and by an excellent temperature, of both, says  Winstanley, he was a just and prudent judge for the King, and a  faithful advocate for the Country.    Here he drew up a bantering answer and rejoinder to a Parliament  officer, who had written to him on account of one Hill, that"]]]
