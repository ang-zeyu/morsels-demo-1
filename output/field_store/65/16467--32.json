Leave them unto the dead, then turn thy face  towards Him Who is the Life-Giver of the world. Beware lest the sayings of  the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and teach the  people with consummate wisdom. Thus enjoineth thee the Ruler of earth and  heaven. He is in truth the Almighty, the Most Generous. Ere long will God  exalt thy remembrance and will inscribe with the Pen of Glory that which  thou didst utter for the sake of His love. He is in truth the Protector of  the doers of good.    Give My remembrance to the one named Murad and say: 'Blessed art thou, O  Murad, inasmuch as thou didst cast away the promptings of thine own desire  and hast followed Him Who is the Desire of all mankind.'    Say: Blessed the slumberer who is awakened by My Breeze. Blessed the  lifeless one who is quickened through My reviving breaths. Blessed the eye  that is solaced by gazing at My beauty. Blessed the wayfarer who directeth  his steps towards the Tabernacle of My glory and majesty. Blessed the  distressed one who seeketh refuge beneath the shadow of My canopy. Blessed  the sore athirst who hasteneth to the soft-flowing waters of My  loving-kindness. Blessed the insatiate soul who casteth away his selfish  desires for love of Me and taketh his place at the banquet table which I  have sent down from the heaven of divine bounty for My chosen ones.  Blessed the abased one who layeth fast hold on the cord of My glory; and  the needy one who entereth beneath the shadow of the Tabernacle of My  wealth. Blessed the ignorant one who seeketh the fountain of My knowledge;  and the heedless one who cleaveth to the cord of My remembrance. Blessed  the soul that hath been raised to life through My quickening breath and  hath gained admittance into My heavenly Kingdom. Blessed the man whom the  sweet savours of reunion with Me have stirred and caused to draw nigh unto  the Dayspring of My Revelation. Blessed the ear that hath heard and the  tongue that hath borne witness and the eye that hath seen and recognized  the Lord Himself, in His great glory and majesty, invested with grandeur  and dominion. Blessed are they that have attained His presence. Blessed  the man who hath sought enlightenment from the Day-Star of My Word.  Blessed he who hath attired his head with the diadem of My love. Blessed  is he who hath heard of My grief and hath arisen to aid Me among My  people. Blessed is he who hath laid down his life in My path and hath  borne manifold hardships for the sake of My Name. Blessed the man who,  assured of My Word, hath arisen from among the dead to celebrate My  praise. Blessed is he that hath been enraptured by My wondrous melodies  and hath rent the veils asunder through the potency of My might. Blessed  is he who hath remained faithful to My Covenant, and whom the things of  the world have not kept back from attaining My Court of holiness. Blessed  is the man who hath detached himself from all else but Me, hath soared in  the atmosphere of My love, hath gained admittance into My Kingdom, gazed  upon My realms of glory, quaffed the living waters of My bounty, hath  drunk his fill from the heavenly river of My loving providence, acquainted  himself with My Cause, apprehended that which I concealed within the  treasury of My Words, and hath shone forth from the horizon of divine  knowledge engaged in My praise and glorification. Verily, he is of Me.  Upon him rest My mercy, My loving-kindness, My bounty and My glory.                                     BISHARAT (GLAD-TIDINGS)      This is the Call of the All-Glorious which is proclaimed from the Supreme  Horizon in the Prison of Akka    He is the Expounder, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.    GOD, the True One, testifieth and the Revealers of His names and  attributes bear witness that Our sole purpose in raising the Call and in  proclaiming His sublime Word is that the ear of the entire creation may,  through the living waters of divine utterance, be purged from lying tales  and become attuned to the holy, the glorious and exalted Word which hath  issued forth from the repository of the knowledge of the Maker of the  Heavens and the Creator of Names. Happy are they that judge with fairness.    O people of the earth!    The first Glad-Tidings which the Mother Book hath, in this Most Great  Revelation, imparted unto all the peoples of the world is that the law of  holy war hath been blotted out from the Book. Glorified be the  All-Merciful, the Lord of grace abounding, through Whom the door of  heavenly bounty hath been flung open in the face of all that are in heaven  and on earth.    The second Glad-Tidings    It is permitted that the peoples and kindreds of the world associate with  one another with joy and radiance. O people! Consort with the followers of  all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. Thus hath the  day-star of His sanction and authority shone forth above the horizon of  the decree of God, the Lord of the worlds.    The third Glad-Tidings concerneth the study of divers languages. This  decree hath formerly streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High: It  behoveth the sovereigns of the world--may God assist them--or the ministers  of the earth to take counsel together and to adopt one of the existing  languages or a new one to be taught to children in schools throughout the  world, and likewise one script. Thus the whole earth will come to be  regarded as one country. Well is it with him who hearkeneth unto His Call  and observeth that whereunto he is bidden by God, the Lord of the Mighty  Throne.    The fourth Glad-Tidings    Should any of the kings--may God aid them--arise to protect and help this  oppressed people, all must vie with one another in loving and in serving  him. This matter is incumbent upon everyone. Well is it with them that act  accordingly.    The fifth Glad-Tidings    In every country where any of this people reside, they must behave towards  the government of that country with loyalty, honesty and truthfulness.  This is that which hath been revealed at the behest of Him Who is the  Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.    It is binding and incumbent upon the peoples of the world, one and all, to  extend aid unto this momentous Cause which is come from the heaven of the  Will of the ever-abiding God, that perchance the fire of animosity which  blazeth in the hearts of some of the peoples of the earth may, through the  living waters of divine wisdom and by virtue of heavenly counsels and  exhortations, be quenched, and the light of unity and concord may shine  forth and shed its radiance upon the world.    We cherish the hope that through the earnest endeavours of such as are the  exponents of the power of God--exalted be His glory--the weapons of war  throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction  and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men.    The sixth Glad-Tidings is the establishment of the Lesser Peace, details  of which have formerly been revealed from Our Most Exalted Pen. Great is  the blessedness of him who upholdeth it and observeth whatsoever hath been  ordained by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    The seventh Glad-Tidings    The choice of clothing and the cut of the beard and its dressing are left  to the discretion of men. But beware, O people, lest ye make yourselves  the playthings of the ignorant.    The eighth Glad-Tidings    The pious deeds of the monks and priests among the followers of the  Spirit(4)--upon Him be the peace of God--are remembered in His presence. In  this Day, however, let them give up the life of seclusion and direct their  steps towards the open world and busy themselves with that which will  profit themselves and others. We have granted them leave to enter into  wedlock that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God, the  Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.    The ninth Glad-Tidings    When the sinner findeth himself wholly detached and freed from all save  God, he should beg forgiveness and pardon from Him. Confession of sins and  transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as it hath never  been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness. Moreover such  confession before people results in one's humiliation and abasement, and  God--exalted be His glory--wisheth not the humiliation of His servants.  Verily He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. The sinner should, between  himself and God, implore mercy from the Ocean of mercy, beg forgiveness  from the Heaven of generosity and say:    O God, my God! I implore Thee by the blood of Thy true lovers who were so  enraptured by Thy sweet utterance that they hastened unto the Pinnacle of  Glory, the site of the most glorious martyrdom, and I beseech Thee by the  mysteries which lie enshrined in Thy knowledge and by the pearls that are  treasured in the ocean of Thy bounty to grant forgiveness unto me and unto  my father and my mother. Of those who show forth mercy, Thou art in truth  the Most Merciful. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the  All-Bountiful.    O Lord! Thou seest this essence of sinfulness turning unto the ocean of  Thy favour and this feeble one seeking the kingdom of Thy divine power and  this poor creature inclining himself towards the day-star of Thy wealth.  By Thy mercy and Thy grace, disappoint him not, O Lord, nor debar him from  the revelations of Thy bounty in Thy days, nor cast him away from Thy door  which Thou hast opened wide to all that dwell in Thy heaven and on Thine  earth.    Alas! Alas! My sins have prevented me from approaching the Court of Thy  holiness and my trespasses have caused me to stray far from the Tabernacle  of Thy majesty. I have committed that which Thou didst forbid me to do and  have put away what Thou didst order me to observe.    I pray Thee by Him Who is the sovereign Lord of Names to write down for me  with the Pen of Thy bounty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#3)"],[1,"body was shaped like a  spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry  too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's.    \"What on earth is it?\" Jane said. \"Shall we take it home?\"    The thing turned its long eyes to look at her, and said--    \"Does she always talk nonsense, or is it only the rubbish on her head  that makes her silly?\"    It looked scornfully at Jane's hat as it spoke.    \"She doesn't mean to be silly,\" Anthea said gently; \"we none of us do,  whatever you may think! Don't be frightened; we don't want to hurt you,  you know.\"    \"Hurt _me_!\" it said. \"_Me_ frightened? Upon my word! Why, you talk as  if I were nobody in particular.\" All its fur stood out like a cat's when  it is going to fight.    \"Well,\" said Anthea, still kindly, \"perhaps if we knew who you are in  particular we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you  angry. Everything we've said so far seems to have done so. Who are you?  And don't get angry! Because really we don't know.\"    \"You don't know?\" it said. \"Well, I knew the world had  changed--but--well, really--Do you mean to tell me seriously you don't  know a Psammead when you see one?\"    \"A Sammyadd? That's Greek to me.\"    \"So it is to everyone,\" said the creature sharply. \"Well, in plain  English, then, a _Sand-fairy_. Don't you know a Sand-fairy when you see  one?\"    It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, \"Of course I  see you are, _now_. It's quite plain now one comes to look at you.\"    \"You came to look at me, several sentences ago,\" it said crossly,  beginning to curl up again in the sand.    \"Oh--don't go away again! Do talk some more,\" Robert cried. \"I didn't  know you were a Sand-fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were  much the wonderfullest thing I'd ever seen.\"    The Sand-fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this.    \"It isn't talking I mind,\" it said, \"as long as you're reasonably civil.  But I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk  nicely to me, perhaps I'll answer you, and perhaps I won't. Now say  something.\"    Of course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert  thought of \"How long have you lived here?\" and he said it at once.    \"Oh, ages--several thousand years,\" replied the Psammead.    \"Tell us about it. Do.\"    \"It's all in books.\"    \"_You_ aren't!\" Jane said. \"Oh, tell us everything you can about  yourself! We don't know anything about you, and you _are_ so nice.\"    The Sand-fairy smoothed his long rat-like whiskers and smiled between  them.    \"Do please tell!\" said the children all together.    It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most  astonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than  you had that there was such a thing as a Sand-fairy in the world, and  now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives.    It drew its eyes in and said--    \"How very sunny it is--quite like old times! Where do you get your  Megatheriums from now?\"    \"What?\" said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to  remember that \"what\" is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or  agitation.    \"Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?\" the Sand-fairy went on.    The children were unable to reply.    \"What do you have for breakfast?\" the Fairy said impatiently, \"and who  gives it to you?\"    \"Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things.  Mother gives it to us. What are Mega-what's-its-names and  Ptero-what-do-you-call-thems? And does anyone have them for breakfast?\"    \"Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time!  Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds--I  believe they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this: of  course there were heaps of Sand-fairies then, and in the morning early  you went out and hunted for them, and when you'd found one it gave you  your wish. People used to send their little boys down to the seashore in  the morning before breakfast to get the day's wishes, and very often the  eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium, ready  jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant, you see, so there was  a good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish, the Ichthyosaurus  was asked for,--he was twenty to forty feet long, so there was plenty of  him. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there were nice  pickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for other  things. But when people had dinner-parties it was nearly always  Megatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great delicacy  and his tail made soup.\"    \"There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over,\" said  Anthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day.    \"Oh no,\" said the Psammead, \"that would never have done. Why, of course  at sunset what was left over turned into stone. You find the stone bones  of the Megatherium and things all over the place even now, they tell  me.\"    \"Who tell you?\" asked Cyril; but the Sand-fairy frowned and began to dig  very fast with its furry hands.    \"Oh, don't go!\" they all cried; \"tell us more about when it was  Megatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this then?\"    It stopped digging.    \"Not a bit,\" it said; \"it was nearly all sand where I lived, and coal  grew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as tea-trays--you find  them now; they're turned into stone. We Sand-fairies used to live on the  seashore, and the children used to come with their little flint-spades  and flint-pails and make castles for us to live in. That's thousands of  years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand.  It's difficult to break yourself of a habit.\"    \"But why did you stop living in the castles?\" asked Robert.    \"It's a sad story,\" said the Psammead gloomily. \"It was because they  _would_ build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used  to come in, and of course as soon as a Sand-fairy got wet it caught  cold, and generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and,  whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a  Megatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be  weeks before you got another wish.\"    \"And did _you_ get wet?\" Robert inquired.    The Sand-fairy shuddered. \"Only once,\" it said; \"the end of the twelfth  hair of my top left whisker--I feel the place still in damp weather. It  was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as  the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scurried away to the back of  the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've  been ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now  I'm not going to tell you another thing.\"    \"Just one more, please,\" said the children. \"Can you give wishes now?\"    \"Of course,\" said it; \"didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You  said, 'I wish you'd come out,' and I did.\"    \"Oh, please, mayn't we have another?\"    \"Yes, but be quick about it. I'm tired of you.\"    I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three  wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the  black-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you  could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation.  These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance  had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.    \"Quick,\" said the Sand-fairy crossly. No one could think of anything,  only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and Jane's  which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care  about it--but still it was better than nothing.    \"I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,\" she said in a great hurry.    The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others  were not any better-looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out his long  eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till  it was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go  in a long sigh.    \"I'm really afraid I can't manage it,\" it said apologetically; \"I must  be out of practice.\"    The children were horribly disappointed.    \"Oh, _do_ try again!\" they said.    \"Well,\" said the Sand-fairy, \"the fact is, I was keeping back a little  strength to give the rest of you your wishes with. If you'll be  contented with one wish a day among the lot of you I daresay I can  screw myself up to it. Do you agree to that?\"    \"Yes, oh yes!\" said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They did not  believe the Sand-fairy could do it. You can always make girls believe  things much easier than you can boys.    It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and  swelled.    \"I do hope it won't hurt itself,\" said Anthea.    \"Or crack its skin,\" Robert said anxiously.    Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so  big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its  breath and went back to its proper size.    \"That's all right,\" it said, panting heavily. \"It'll come easier  to-morrow.\"    \"Did it hurt much?\" said Anthea.    \"Only my poor whisker, thank you,\" said he, \"but you're a kind and  thoughtful child. Good day.\"    It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and  disappeared in the sand.    Then the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found  itself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful.    They stood for some moments in silence. Each thought that its brothers  and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen  up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy.  Anthea spoke first--    \"Excuse me,\" she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue  eyes and a cloud of russet hair, \"but have you seen two little boys and  a little"]]]
