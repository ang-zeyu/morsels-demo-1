Al caballero espanol: To the Spanish gentleman.    These are the only contractions that occur in Spanish; with the other  prepositions the article simply follows, as--    By, for, with, in, on, without, behind, the father:  Por, Para, Con, En, Sobre, Sin, Tras, el padre.    The following are the _principal cases_ in which the definite article is  used in Spanish and not in English--    1. Before nouns taken in a general sense, as--    El oro y la plata: Gold and silver.  Los hombres o las mujeres: Men or women.    2. Before titles denoting dignity and profession,[13] as--    El Senor Fulano: Mr. So-and-So.  El Rey Jorge V.: King George V.  El Profesor Rosales: Professor Rosales.    The only exception is \"Don\" (Mr.), only used before Christian names, as  Don Francisco (Mr. Francis).    3. Generally before each of several nouns following each other when they  are material possessions, as--    La casa y el jardin de mi hijo: My son's[14] house and garden.  Las puertas y las ventanas de mi casa: The doors and windows of my  house.    But--    La diligencia, devocion, y virtud de mi primo: the diligence, devotion  and virtue of my cousin.    4. Before a proper noun qualified by an adjective, as--    El valiente Juan: Brave John.[15]    The following are the principal cases in which the indefinite article is  used in English and not in Spanish--    1. Before a noun following the verb \"to be,\" or other similar verbs,  as--    Es capitan[16]: He is a captain.  Soy frances: I am a Frenchman.  Se hizo actor: He became an actor.  Le elegimos miembro de esta sociedad: We elect him a member of this  society.  Fue elegido miembro: He was elected a member.    2. After \"what\" used in exclamations, as: Que hermosa vista: What a fine  view!    3. Before \"hundred\" and \"thousand\": 100--ciento, 1,000--mil.

THE NOUN.      The noun in Spanish has only two genders.    =Nouns= denoting =male= beings are =Masculine=.     \"       \"     =female=  \"    \"  =Feminine=.    When there is no real gender, nouns are called masculine or feminine  according to their terminations.    GENERAL RULE.--All nouns that terminate in _a, ion, d_, also abstract  nouns ending in _ez_, are feminine, as--    La villa: The town. La nacion[21]: The nation.  La ciudad: The city or large town. La honradez: Honesty.  The other terminations are masculine.    There are many exceptions to the above rule, principally in nouns ending  in _E_.[22]    [Footnote 21: English words ending in \"tion\" end in _cion_ in Spanish.  (Note the accent.)]    [Footnote 22: Appendix I--for reference only at this stage.]      =Formation of the Plural of Nouns=.    Nouns ending in a vowel which is not _stressed_ and also nouns ending in  _E_ bearing the stress, add =S= to form the plural.    All others add =Es=.    EXCEPTIONS--    1. Nouns ending in _Z_ in the _sing._ change it into =Ces=.  2. Nouns ending in _S_ do not change _unless the last syllable_ is  stressed.      EXAMPLES--    El amo: The master. Los amos: The masters.  El cunado: The brother-in-law. Los cunados: The brothers-in-law.  La cunada: The sister-in-law. Las cunadas: The sisters-in-law.  El yerno: The son-in-law. Los yernos: The sons-in-law.  La nuera: The daughter-in-law. Las nueras: The daughters-in-law.  El arbol: The tree. Los arboles: The trees.

Civilised man is  appreciating them more and more every day; and every day he is  becoming better able to reach them. By giving absolute security to all  desirable species in at least two different localities we can keep  objects of Nature study in the best possible way both for ourselves  and our posterity.    Only twelve years ago forty mills were debasing the immemorial and  gigantic sequoia into mere timber in its last refuge in California.  But even the general public sees now that this was a barbarous and  idiotic perversion of relative values. What is a little perishable  timber, for which substitutes can be found elsewhere, compared with a  grove of trees that will be the wonder and delight of generations?  What is the fleeting but abominable gratification of destroying the  harmless lizard-like Tuatera of New Zealand compared with the deep  interest of preserving it as the last living vertebrate that takes us  back to Primary times? What is the momentary gratification of wearing  egret feathers compared with the certainty of soon destroying the  herons that produce them altogether; or what can compensate for the  vile cruelty done to mutilated parent birds and starving young, or the  murder of Bradley, the bird warden when trying to protect them?      LETTERS    The following quotations from a few of the many and wholly unsolicited  letters received are arranged in alphabetical order. They are strictly  _verbatim_:    _Australia._ The Animals' Protection Society. F. Montagu Rothery,  Esq., Secretary, 82 Pitt Street, Sydney, New South Wales.         Here in this State our _fauna_ and _flora_ are both rapidly       disappearing, there being so many agencies at work for their       destruction. It will soon be too late to save many of our       beautiful birds and animals, and I am anxious to bring       under notice your words for the preservation of animals by       a system of sanctuaries.    Dr. Robert Bell, late Chief Geologist, Geological Survey of Canada,  who has made many explorations in Labrador and adjacent lands and  waters, and who has always given special attention to the mammals,  writes:         I approve very heartily of the plan. It will be a humane       thing to try to protect the animals and will be very       advantageous in every way. It will no doubt receive the       sympathy of all classes. There will, however, be some       difficulties to overcome and much work to be done before the       plan gets into successful operation.... As to the location       and dimensions of the sanctuary, the north side of the lower       St. Lawrence is the most suitable or only region left,       except where it is too far north to benefit the most of the       mammals and birds which we should try to preserve. It will       be desirable to reserve and protect as great a length of the       shore as possible, but perhaps enough will be found between       Bradore bay on the east and Great Mekattina island on the       west, or this might be extended to Natashkwan. To carry it       up to Mingan, it would become more and more difficult to       protect the coast the further up you come. Between Mekattina       island and Natashkwan, there are no attractive rivers to       tempt trespassers to go inland, those which exist being       difficult for canoe navigation....         The animals soon find out where they are safe and come to       live in even a small area. The Algonquin park is a case in       point. There the bears have increased immensely in a few       years and the less noticeable mammals and birds have also       increased very much. I know of a more conspicuous case of a       small area, on the Nelson river, where, owing to an       old-standing superstition of the Indians, the animals have       not been molested for a long period and they have become       much more numerous than elsewhere.... Everything that can be       killed is called Game. Most of it should be called animal       murder and should be discouraged.         The Sanctuary should be placed in charge of a committee of       naturalists. But zoologists are scarce in Canada and those       who have taken an interest in the animals might be included.       Faithful men to carry out their instructions I think can be       found.    The President of the Boone and Crockett Club, Major W. Austin  Wadsworth, Geneseo, N.Y., wrote:         I wish to express officially the admiration of our Club for       your paper on Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador, because the       whole question of Game Refuges has been one of especial       interest to us and we have been identified with all       movements in that direction in this country.    Captain R.G. Boulton, R.N., retired, was engaged for many years on the  Hydrographic Survey of the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gulf and  Newfoundland. He says:         There is no doubt, as regards the conservation of _birds_,       that sea-birds, such as gulls, &c., &c., are useful \"aids to       navigation,\" by warning the mariner of the proximity of       land, on making the coast. On foggy shores, like those of       Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, they are especially       useful, and it is to the advantage of the voyaging public to       conserve what we have left. While carrying on the Survey of       Georgian bay, and North channel of lake Huron, 1883-1893,       the _Bayfield_, my surveying vessel, was more than once kept       off the rocks in the foggy weather which prevails in May and       June, by the chirping and warbling of land birds.    His Excellency the Right Hon. James Bryce, British Ambassador at  Washington, who is a keen botanist and lover of the wilds, writes:         It is painfully interesting. One finds it hard to realize       that such wicked waste of the gifts of Providence, and such       horrible cruelty, should be going on in our time. You are       doing a great service in calling attention to them and I       heartily wish you success in your endeavours.    At a special meeting of the Board of Governors of the Camp-Fire Club  of America, held on December 12th last, the following resolution was  unanimously passed:         \"_Whereas_, the Camp-Fire Club of America desires to express       its interest in and endorsement of the plan for the       establishment of Bird and Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador,       outlined by Lieut.-Colonel William Wood in his address       before the Commission of Conservation delivered at Quebec,       in January, 1911;         \"We believe that the establishment of adequate sanctuaries       is one of the most potent factors in the conservation of our       rapidly disappearing wild life. The Camp-Fire Club of       America has taken, and is taking, an active part in the       movement for the establishment of such sanctuaries in       various places. We believe that such sanctuaries should be       established in Labrador in the near future, while an       abundance of undeveloped land is available and before the       wild life has been decimated to such an extent as to make       its preservation difficult;         \"_Be it therefore Resolved_, that the Secretary convey to       Colonel Wood the assurance of our hearty interest in and       approval of the plan to establish adequate animal       sanctuaries in Labrador, and our hope that such sanctuaries       will be established in the near future.\"    Dr. John M. Clarke, Director, Science Division, New York State  Education Department, and a gentleman acquainted with the wild life of  the gulf of St. Lawrence, writes:         I have taken much interest in reading your paper. It seems       to be based on an extraordinary acquaintance with the       situation.         Canada is blessed with many unique natural resorts of animal       life and I have been particularly impressed with the       invasions that have been made on the wonderful nesting       places of the waterfowl. In my repeated stays on the coast       of Gaspe and the islands of the Gulf, now running over a       dozen years, I have had my attention forced to the hideous       sacrifices of bird life that are constantly going on; for       example in the Magdalen islands with their extraordinary       array of shore birds. The great lagoons within the islands       afford ideal breeding conditions, and an extraordinary       attraction for the hunter as well.         My observation leads me to the conviction that the shooting       law is not in the least respected on these islands, except       perhaps by the residents themselves. In some cases the       outsider is obliged to wait for the fall migration of the       ducks and geese and so comes within the law, but there are       plenty of early migrants that arrive during the close       season, only to be quickly picked up by the summer hunter,       who realizes that he is too far away to incur the law's       force.         As far as the shore birds are concerned, it is not the       occasional hunter that does the real damage. The islands are       becoming widely known to students of birds, and it is the       bird student, the member of the Audubon Society, (in most       instances, I regret to say, men of my own country) who are       guilty of ruthless slaughter of the shore birds for their       skins, and particularly for their eggs; all this in the       protected season.         The situation is even worse on the Bird rocks. That is a       protected area and yet is subject to fearful attacks from       the egg hunters. I do not mean the commercial \"eggers,\" but       the member of the Audubon Society who has a collection of       birds' eggs and skins and wants duplicates in order to enter       into exchange with his colleagues. I met there on one of my       visits an American \"student\" who had taken 369 clutches of       eggs of each of the seven or more species of waterfowl there       breeding, thus destroying at one swoop"]]]
