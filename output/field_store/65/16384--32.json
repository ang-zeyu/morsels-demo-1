[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#3)"],[1,"of the 5th of  August Secretary Tumulty called the correspondents and told them that  the President, who was deeply distressed by the war, and who was  suffering personally because of his wife's illness, had written at his  wife's bedside the following message:      \"As official head of one of the powers signatory to The Hague  Convention, I feel it to be my privilege and my duty, under Article III  of that Convention, to say to you in the spirit of most earnest  friendship that I should welcome an opportunity to act in the interests  of European peace, either now or at any other time that might be  thought more suitable, as an occasion to serve you and all concerned in  a way that would afford me lasting cause for gratitude and happiness.             \"(Signed) WOODROW WILSON.\"      The President's Secretary cabled this to the Emperors of Germany and  Austria-Hungary; the King of England, the Czar of Russia and the  President of France.  The President's brief note touched the chord of  sympathy of the whole world; but it was too late then to stop the war.  European statesmen had been preparing for a conflict.  With the public  support which each nation had, each government wanted to fight until  there was a victory.    One of the first things which seemed to appeal to President Wilson was  the fact that not only public opinion of Europe, but of America, sought  a spokesman.  Unlike Roosevelt, who led public opinion, unlike Taft,  who disregarded it, Wilson took the attitude that the greatest force in  the world was public opinion.  He believed public opinion was greater  than the presidency.  He felt that he was the man the American people  had chosen to interpret and express their opinion.  Wilson's policy was  to permit public opinion to rule America.  Those of us who spent two  years in Germany could see this very clearly.    The President announced the plank for his international policy when he  spoke at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association, at  Washington, shortly after the war began.    [Illustration: First page of the author's passport.]    \"_The opinion of the world is the mistress of the world_,\" he said,  \"and the processes of international law are the slow processes by which  opinion works its will.  What impresses me is the constant thought that  that is the tribunal at the bar of which we all sit.  I would call your  attention, incidentally, to the circumstance that it does not observe  the ordinary rules of evidence; which has sometimes suggested to me  that the ordinary rules of evidence had shown some signs of growing  antique.  Everything, rumour included, is heard in this court, and the  standard of judgment is not so much the character of the testimony as  the character of the witness.  The motives are disclosed, the purposes  are conjectured and that opinion is finally accepted which seems to be,  not the best founded in law, perhaps, but the best founded in integrity  of character and of morals.  That is the process which is slowly  working its will upon the world; and what we should be watchful of is  not so much jealous interests as sound principles of action.  The  disinterested course is not alone the biggest course to pursue; but it  is in the long run the most profitable course to pursue.  If you can  establish your character you can establish your credit.    \"Understand me, gentlemen, I am not venturing in this presence to  impeach the law.  For the present, by the force of circumstances, I am  in part the embodiment of the law and it would be very awkward to  disavow myself.  But I do wish to make this intimation, that in this  time of world change, in this time when we are going to find out just  how, in what particulars, and to what extent the real facts of human  life and the real moral judgments of mankind prevail, it is worth while  looking inside our municipal law and seeing whether the judgments of  the law are made square with the moral judgments of mankind.  For I  believe that we are custodians of the spirit of righteousness, of the  spirit of equal handed justice, of the spirit of hope which believes in  the perfectibility of the law with the perfectibility of human life  itself.    \"Public life, like private life, would be very dull and dry if it were  not for this belief in the essential beauty of the human spirit and the  belief that the human spirit should be translated into action and into  ordinance.  Not entire.  You cannot go any faster than you can advance  the average moral judgment of the mass, but you can go at least as fast  as that, and you can see to it that you do not lag behind the average  moral judgments of the mass.  I have in my life dealt with all sorts  and conditions of men, and I have found that the flame of moral  judgment burns just as bright in the man of humble life and limited  experience as in the scholar and man of affairs.  And I would like his  voice always to be heard, not as a witness, not as speaking in his own  case, but as if he were the voice of men in general, in our courts of  justice, as well as the voice of the lawyers, remembering what the law  has been.  My hope is that, being stirred to the depths by the  extraordinary circumstances of the time in which we live, we may  recover from those steps something of a renewal of that vision of the  law with which men may be supposed to have started out in the old days  of the oracles, who commune with the intimations of divinity.\"    Before this war, very few nations paid any attention to public opinion.  France was probably the beginner.  Some twenty years before 1914,  France began to extend her civilisation to Russia, Italy, the Balkans  and Syria.  In Roumania, today, one hears almost as much French as  Roumanian spoken.  Ninety per cent of the lawyers in Bucharest were  educated in Paris.  Most of the doctors in Roumania studied in France.  France spread her influence by education.    The very fact that the belligerents tried to mobilise public opinion in  the United States in their favour shows that 1914 was a milestone in  international affairs.  This was the first time any foreign power ever  attempted to fight for the good will--the public opinion--of this  nation.  The governments themselves realised the value of public  opinion in their own boundaries, but when the war began they realised  that it was a power inside the realms of their neighbours, too.    When differences of opinion developed between the United States and the  belligerents the first thing President Wilson did was to publish all  the documents and papers in the possession of the American government  relating to the controversy.  The publicity which the President gave  the diplomatic correspondence between this government and Great Britain  over the search and seizure of vessels emphasised in Washington this  tendency in our foreign relations.  At the beginning of England's  seizure of American merchantmen carrying cargoes to neutral European  countries, the State Department lodged individual protests, but no heed  was paid to them by the London officials.  Then the United States made  public the negotiations seeking to accomplish by publicity what a  previous exchange of diplomatic notes failed to do.    Discussing this action of the President in an editorial on \"Diplomacy  in the Dark,\" the New York _World_ said:      \"President Wilson's protest to the British Government is a clear,  temperate, courteous assertion of the trade rights of neutral countries  in time of war.  It represents not only the established policy of the  United States but the established policy of Great Britain.  It voices  the opinion of practically all the American people, and there are few  Englishmen, even in time of war, who will take issue with the  principles upheld by the President.  Yet a serious misunderstanding was  risked because it is the habit of diplomacy to operate in the dark.    \"Fortunately, President Wilson by making the note public prevented the  original misunderstanding from spreading.  But the lesson ought not to  stop there.  Our State Department, as Mr. Wickersham recently pointed  out in a letter to the _World_, has never had a settled policy of  publicity in regard to our diplomatic affairs.  No Blue Books or White  Books are ever issued.  What information the country obtains must be  pried out of the Department.  This has been our diplomatic policy for  more than a century, and it is a policy that if continued will some day  end disastrously.\"      Speaking in Atlanta in 1912, President Wilson stated that this  government would never gain another foot of territory by conquest.  This dispelled whatever apprehension there was that the United States  might seek to annex Mexico.  Later, in asking Congress to repeal the  Panama Tolls Act of 1912, the President said the good will of Europe  was a more valuable asset than commercial advantages gained by  discriminatory legislation.    Thus at the outset of President Wilson's first administration, foreign  powers were given to understand that Mr. Wilson believed in the power  of public opinion; that he favoured publicity as a means of  accomplishing what could not be done by confidential negotiations; that  he did not believe in annexation and that he was ready at any time to  help end the war.      III    Before the Blockade    President Wilson's policy during the first six months of the war was  one of impartiality and neutrality.  The first diplomatic  representative in Washington to question the sincerity of the executive  was Dr. Constantine Dumba, the exiled Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, who  was sent to the United States because he was not a noble, and,  therefore, better able to understand and interpret American ways!  He  asked me one day whether I thought Wilson was neutral.  He said he had  been told the President was pro-English.  He believed, he said, that  everything the President had done so far showed he sympathised with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#3)"],[1,"be necessary to  convey the observers to their destined stations; but that the society were  in no condition to defray the expence of such an undertaking.    In consequence of this memorial, the Admiralty were directed by his majesty  to provide proper vessels for this purpose. Accordingly, the Endeavour  bark, which had been built for the coal-trade, was purchased and fitted out  for the southern voyage, and I was honoured with the command of her. The  Royal Society, soon after, appointed me, in conjunction with Mr Charles  Green the astronomer, to make the requisite observations on the transit.    It was at first intended to perform this great, and now a principal  business of our voyage, either at the Marquesas, or else at one of those  islands which Tasman had called Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Middleburg, now  better known under the name of the Friendly Islands. But while the  Endeavour was getting ready for the expedition, Captain Wallis returned  from his voyage round the world, in the course of which he had discovered  several islands in the South Sea; and, amongst others, Otaheite. This  island was preferred to any of those before mentioned, on account of the  conveniences it afforded; because its place had been well ascertained, and  found to be extremely well suited to our purpose.    I was therefore ordered to proceed directly to Otaheite; and after  astronomical observations should be completed, to prosecute the design of  making discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, by proceeding to the south  as far as the latitude of 40 deg.; then, if I found no land, to proceed to the  west between 40 deg. and 35 deg., till I fell in with New Zealand, which I was to  explore; and thence to return to England by such route as I should think  proper.    1768 Cook's first voyage.    In the prosecution of these instructions, I sailed from Deptford the 30th  July, 1768; from Plymouth the 26th of August, touched at Madeira, Rio de  Janeiro, and Straits Le Maire, and entered the South Pacific Ocean by Cape  Horn in January the following year.    I endeavoured to make a direct course to Otaheite, and in part succeeded;  but I made no discovery till I got within the tropic, where I fell in with  Lagoon Island, Two Groups, Bird Island, Chain Island; and on the 13th of  April arrived at Otaheite, where I remained three months, during which time  the observations on the transit were made.    I then left it; discovered and visited the Society Isles and Oheteroa;  thence proceeded to the south till I arrived in the latitude of 40 deg. 22',  longitude 147 deg. 29' W.; and, on the 6th of October, fell in with the east  side of New Zealand.    I continued exploring the coast of this country till the 31st of March,  1770, when I quitted it, and proceeded to New Holland; and having surveyed  the eastern coast of that vast country, which part had not before been  visited, I passed between its northern extremity and New Guinea, landed on  the latter, touched at the island of Savu, Batavia, the Cape of Good Hope,  and St Helena,* and arrived in England on the 12th of July, 1771.    [* In the account given of St Helena in the narrative of my former voyage,  I find two mistakes. Its inhabitants are far from exercising a wanton  cruelty over their slaves, and they have had wheel-carriages and  porters' knots for many years.]    In this voyage I was accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander; the first a  gentleman of ample fortune; the other an accomplished disciple of Linnaeus,  and one of the librarians of the British Museum; both of them distinguished  in the learned world, for their extensive and accurate knowledge of natural  history. These gentlemen, animated by the love of science, and by a desire  to pursue their enquiries in the remote regions I was preparing to visit,  desired permission to make a voyage with me. The Admiralty readily complied  with a request that promised such advantage to the republic of letters.  They accordingly embarked with me, and participated in all the dangers and  sufferings of our tedious and fatiguing navigation.    The voyages of Messrs de Surville, Kerguelen, and Marion, of which some  account is given in the following work, did not come to my knowledge time  enough to afford me any advantage; and as they have not been communicated  to the world in a public way, I can say little about them, or about two  other voyages, which, I am told, have been made by the Spaniards; one to  Easter Island in the year 1769, and the other to Otaheite in 1775.    Before I begin my narrative of the expedition entrusted to my care, it will  be necessary to add here some account of its equipment, and of some other  matters equally interesting, connected with my subject.    Soon after my return home in the Endeavour, it was resolved to equip two  ships, to complete the discovery of the Southern Hemisphere. The nature of  this voyage required ships of a particular construction, and the Endeavour  being gone to Falkland's Isles as a store-ship, the Navy-board was directed  to purchase two such ships as were most suitable for this service.    At this time various opinions were espoused by different people, touching  the size and kind of vessels most proper for such a voyage. Some were for  having large ships, and proposed those of forty guns, or East India  Company's ships. Others preferred large good sailing frigates, or three-  decked ships, employed in the Jamaica trade, fitted with round-houses. But  of all that was said and offered to the Admiralty's consideration on this  subject, as far as has come to my knowledge, what, in my opinion, was most  to the purpose, was suggested by the Navy-board.    As the kind of ships most proper to be employed on discoveries, is a very  interesting consideration to the adventurers in such undertakings, it may  possibly be of use to those, who, in future, may be so employed, to give  here the purport of the sentiments of the Navy-board thereon, with whom,  after the experience of two voyages of three years each, I perfectly agree.    The success of such undertakings as making discoveries in distant parts of  the world, will principally depend on the preparations being well adapted  to what ought to be the first considerations, namely, the preservation of  the adventurers and ships; and this will ever chiefly depend on the kind,  the size, and the properties of the ships chosen for the service.    These primary considerations will not admit of any other that may interfere  with the necessary properties of the ships. Therefore, in choosing the  ships, should any of the most advantageous properties be wanting, and the  necessary room in them, be in any degree diminished, for less important  purposes, such a step would be laying a foundation for rendering the  undertaking abortive in the first instance.    As the greatest danger to be apprehended and provided against, on a voyage  of discovery, especially to the most distant parts of the globe, is that of  the ship's being liable to be run a-ground on an unknown, desert, or  perhaps savage coast; so no consideration should be set in competition with  that of her being of a construction of the safest kind, in which the  officers may, with the least hazard, venture upon a strange coast. A ship  of this kind must not be of a great draught of water, yet of a sufficient  burden and capacity to carry a proper quantity of provisions and  necessaries for her complement of men, and for the time requisite to  perform the voyage.    She must also be of a construction that will bear to take the ground; and  of a size, which in case of necessity, may be safely and conveniently laid  on shore, to repair any accidental damage or defect. These properties are  not to be found in ships of war of forty guns, nor in frigates, nor in East  India Company's ships, nor in large three-decked West India ships, nor  indeed in any other but North-country-built ships, or such as are built for  the coal-trade, which are peculiarly adapted to this purpose.    In such a vessel an able sea-officer will be most venturesome, and better  enabled to fulfil his instructions, than he possibly can (or indeed than  would be prudent for him to attempt) in one of any other _sort_ or _size_.    Upon the whole, I am firmly of opinion, that no ships are so proper for  discoveries in distant unknown parts, as those constructed as was the  Endeavour, in which I performed my former voyage. For no ships of any other  kind can contain stores and provisions sufficient (in proportion to the  necessary number of men,) considering the length of time it will be  necessary they should last. And, even if another kind of ships could stow a  sufficiency, yet on arriving at the parts for discovery, they would still,  from the nature of their construction and size, be _less fit_ for the  purpose.    Hence, it may be concluded, so little progress had been hitherto made in  discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere. For all ships which attempted it  before the Endeavour, were unfit for it; although the officers employed in  them had done the utmost in their power.    It was upon this consideration that the Endeavour was chosen for that  voyage. It was to those properties in her that those on board owed their  preservation; and hence we were enabled to prosecute discoveries in those  seas so much longer than any other ship ever did, or could do. And,  although discovery was not the first object of that voyage, I could venture  to traverse a far greater space of sea, til then unnavigated; to discover  greater tracts of country in high and low south latitudes, and to persevere  longer in exploring and surveying more correctly the extensive coasts of  those new-discovered countries, than any former navigator perhaps had done  during one voyage.    In short, these properties in the ships, with perseverance and resolution  in their commanders, will enable them to execute their orders; to go beyond"]]]
