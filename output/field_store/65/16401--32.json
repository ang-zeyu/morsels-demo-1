The Englishman who travels in Normandy, meets, at every step, with      reminiscences of his kings, his ancestors, his institutions, and his      customs. Churches yet standing, after the lapse of seven centuries;      majestic ruins; tombs--even to the very sound of the clock--all unite      in affecting, here, the heart of a British subject: every thing seems      to tell him that, in former times, HERE was his country; here the      residence of his sovereigns; and here the cradle of his manners. This      was more than sufficient to enflame the lively imagination of Mr. D.      and to decide him to visit, in person, a country already explored by a      great number of his countrymen; but he conceived that his narrative      should embody other topics than those which ordinarily appeared in the      text of his predecessors.        \"His work then is not only a description of castles, towns, churches,      public monuments of every kind:--it is not only a representation of      the general aspect of the country, as to its picturesque      appearances--but it is an extended, minute, though occasionally      inexact, account of public and private libraries; with reflections      upon certain customs of the country, and upon the character of those      who inhabit it. It is in short the personal history of the author,      throughout the whole length of his journey. Not the smallest incident,      however indifferent, but what has a place in the letters of the      Bibliographer. Thus, he mentions every Inn where he stops: recommends      or scolds the landlord--according to his civility or exaction. Has the      author passed a bad night? the reader is sure to know it on the      following morning. On the other hand, has he had a good night's rest      in a comfortable bed? [dans un lit _comfortable_?] We are as sure to      know this also, as soon as he awakes:--and thus far we are relieved      from anxiety about the health of the traveller. Cold and heat--fine      weather and bad weather--every variation of atmosphere is scrupulously      recorded.    What immediately follows, is unworthy of M. Licquet; because it not only  implies a charge of a heinous description--accusing me of an insidious  intrusion into domestic circles, a violation of confidence, and a  systematic derision of persons and things--but because the French  translator, exercising that sense and shrewdness which usually distinguish  him, MUST have known that such a charge _could_ not have been founded in  FACT. He must have known that any gentleman, leaving England with those  letters which brought me in contact with some of the first circles on the  Continent, MUST have left it without leaving his character _behind_ him;  and that such a character could not, in the natural order of things--seen  even through the sensitive medium of a French critic--have been guilty of  the grossness and improprieties imputed to me by M. Licquet. I treat  therefore this \"damnation in wholesale\" with scorn and contempt: and hasten  to impress the reader with a more favourable opinion of my Norman  translator. He _will_ have it that        \"the English Traveller's imagination is lively and ardent--and his      spirit, that of raillery and lightness. He examines as he runs along;      that is to say, he does not give himself time to examine; he examines      ill; he deceives himself; and he subjects his readers to be deceived      with him. He traverses, at a hard trot, one of the most ancient towns      in France; puts his head out of his carriage window--and boldly      decides that the town is of the time of Francis I.\"![9] p. xviij.    There is pleasantry, and perhaps some little truth, in this vein of  observation; and it had been better, perhaps, for the credit of the good  taste and gentleman-like feeling of Mons. Licquet, if he had uniformly  maintained his character in these respects. I have however, in the  subsequent pages,[10] occasionally grappled with my annotator in proving  the fallacy, or the want of charity, of many of his animadversions: and the  reader probably may not be displeased, if, by way of \"avant propos,\" I  indulge him here with a specimen of them--taken from his preface. M.  Licquet says, that I \"create scenes; arrange a drama; trace characters;  imagine a dialogue, frequently in French--and in what French--gracious  God!--in assigning to postilions a ridiculous language, and to men of the  world the language of postilions.\" These be sharp words:[11] but what does  the Reader imagine may be the probable \"result\" of the English Traveller's  inadvertencies?... A result, (\"gracious Heaven!\") very little anticipated  by the author. Let him ponder well upon the awful language which ensues.  \"What (says M. Licquet) will quickly be the result, with us, of such  indiscretions as those of which M. Dibdin is guilty? The necessity of  SHUTTING OUR PORTS, or at least of placing a GUARD UPON OUR LIPS!\" There is  some consolation however left for me, in balancing this tremendous  denunciation by M. Licquet's eulogy of my good qualities--which a natural  diffidence impels me to quote in the original words of their author.        \"A Dieu ne plaise, toutefois, que j'accuse ici LE COEUR de M. Dibdin.      Je n'ai jamais eu l'honneur de le voir: je ne le connais que par ses      ecrits; principalement par son _Splendid Tour_, et je ne balance pas a      declarer que l'auteur doit etre doue d'une ame honnete, et de ces      qualites fondamentales qui constituent l'homme de bien. Il prefere sa      croyance; mais il respecte la croyance des autres; son erudition      parait....[12] variee. Son amour pour les antiquites est immense; et      par antiquites j'entends ici tout ce qui est _antique_ ou seulement      _ancien_, quellesque soient d'ailleurs la nature et la forme des      objets.\" Pref. p. xv. xvij.    Once more; and to conclude with M. Licquet. After these general  observations upon the _Text_ of the Tour, M. Licquet favours us with the  following--upon the _Plates_. \"These plates (says he) are intended to  represent some of the principal monuments; the most beautiful landscapes,  and the most remarkable persons, comprehending even the servants of an inn.  If _talent_ be sought in these Engravings, it will doubtless be found in  them; but strangers must not seek for _fidelity_ of representation from  what is before their eyes. The greater number of the Designs are, in some  sort, ideal compositions, which, by resembling every thing, resemble  nothing in particular: and it is worthy of remark that the Artist, in  imitation of the Author, seems to have thought that he had only to shew  himself _clever_, without troubling himself to be _faithful_.\" To this, I  reply in the very words of M. Licquet himself: \"the decision is severe;  luckily it is unjust.\" The only portions of the designs of their skilful  author, which may be taxed with a tendency to extravagance, are the  _groups_: which, when accompanied by views of landscapes, or of monuments,  are probably too profusely indulged in; but the _individuals_, constituting  those groups, belong precisely to the _country_ in which they are  represented. In the first and second volumes they are _French_; in the  third they are _Germans_--all over. Will M. Licquet pretend to say that the  churches, monasteries, streets, and buildings, with which the previous  Edition of this Tour is so elaborately embellished, have the slightest  tendency to IMAGINED SCENERY? If he do, his optics must be peculiarly his  own. I have, in a subsequent page, (p. 34, note) slightly alluded to the  cost and risk attendant on the Plates; but I may confidently affirm, from  experience, that two thirds of the expense incurred would have secured the  same sale at the same price. However, the die is cast; and the voice of  lamentation is fruitless.    I now come to the consideration of M. Licquet's coadjutor, M. CRAPELET.  Although the line of conduct pursued by that very singular gentleman be of  an infinitely more crooked description than that of his Predecessor, yet,  in this place, I shall observe less respecting it; inasmuch as, in the  subsequent pages, (pp. 209, 245, 253, 400, &c.) the version and annotations  of M. Crapelet have been somewhat minutely discussed. Upon the SPIRIT which  could give rise to such a version, and such annotations, I will here only  observe, that it very much resembles that of searchers of our  street-pavements; who, with long nails, scrape out the dirt from the  interstices of the stones, with the hope of making a discovery of some lost  treasure which may compensate the toil of perseverance. The love of lucre  may, or may not, have influenced my Parisian translator; but the love of  discovery of latent error, and of exposure of venial transgression, has  undoubtedly, from beginning to end, excited his zeal and perseverance. That  carping spirit, which shuts its eyes upon what is liberal and kind, and  withholds its assent to what is honourable and just, it is the  distinguished lot--and, perhaps, as the translator may imagine, the  distinguished felicity--of M. Crapelet to possess. Never was greater  reluctance displayed in admitting even the palpable truths of a text, than  what is displayed in the notes of M. Crapelet: and whenever a concurring  sentiment comes from him, it seems to exude like his heart's life-blood.  Having already answered, in detail, his separate publication confined to my  30th Letter[13]--(the 8th of the second volume, in _this_ edition) and  having replied to those animadversions which appear in his translation of  the whole of the second volume, in this edition--it remains here only to  consign the Translator to the careful and impartial consideration of the  Reader, who, it is requested, may be umpire between both parties. Not to  admit that the text of this Edition is in many places improved, from the  suggestions of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16250"],[0,"Tristan and Isolda: Opera in Three Acts (#3)"],[1,"    ISOLDA (_quickly_). Vengeance for Morold!    TRISTAN (_quietly_). Mindst thou that?    ISOLDA (_animated_). Dare you to flout me?--  Was he not my betrothed,  that noble Irish knight?  For his sword a blessing I sought;  for me only he fought.  When he was murdered  no honor fell.  In that heartfelt misery  my vow was framed;  if no man remained to right it,  I, a maid, must needs requite it.--  Weak and maimed,  when might was mine,  why at thy death did I pause?  Thou shalt know the secret cause.--  Thy hurts I tended  that, when sickness ended,  thou shouldst fall by some man,  as Isolda's revenge should plan.  But now attempt  thy fate to foretell me?  if their friendship all men do sell thee,  what foe can seek to fell thee?    TRISTAN (_pale and gloomy, offers her his sword_). If  thou so lovedst this lord,  then lift once more my sword,  nor from thy purpose refrain;  let the weapon not fail again.    ISOLDA. Put up thy sword  which once I swung,  when vengeful rancor  my bosom wrung,  when thy masterful eyes  did ask me straight  whether King Mark  might seek me for mate.  The sword harmless descended.--  Drink, let our strife be ended!    (ISOLDA _beckons_ BRANGAENA. _She trembles and hesitates to  obey_. ISOLDA _commands her with a more imperious gesture_.  BRANGAENA _sets about preparing the drink_.)    VOICES OF THE CREW (_without_). Ho! heave ho! hey!  Reduce the sail!  The foresail in!  Ho! heave ho! hey!    TRISTAN (_starting from his gloomy brooding_). Where  are we?    ISOLDA. Near to shore.  Tristan, is warfare ended?  Hast not a word to offer?    TRISTAN (_darkly_). Concealment's mistress  makes me silent:  I know what she conceals,  conceal, too, more than she knows.    ISOLDA. Thy silence nought  but feigning I deem.  Friendship wilt thou still deny?    (_Renewed cries of the Sailors_.)    (_At an impatient sign from_ ISOLDA BRANGAENA _hands  her the filled cup_.)    ISOLDA (_advancing with the cup to_ TRISTAN, _who gazes  immovably into her eyes_).  Thou hear'st the cry?  The shore's in sight:  we must ere long (_with slight scorn_)  stand by King Mark together.    SAILORS (_without_). Haul the warp!  Anchor down!    TRISTAN (_starting wildly_). Down with the anchor!  Her stern to the stream!  The sails a-weather the mast!    (_He takes the cup from_ ISOLDA.)    I know the Queen  of Ireland well,  unquestioned are  her magic arts:  the balsam cured me  which she brought;  now bid me quaff the cup,  that I may quite recover.  Heed to my all--  atoning oath,  which in return I tender  Tristan's honor--  highest truth!  Tristan's anguish--  brave distress!  Traitor spirit,  dawn-illumined!  Endless trouble's  only truce!  Oblivion's kindly draught,  with rapture thou art quaff'd!    (_He lifts the cup and drinks_.)    ISOLDA. Betrayed e'en here?  I must halve it!--    (_She wrests the cup from his hand_.)    Betrayer, I drink to thee!    [_She drinks, and then throws away the cup. Both, seized with  shuddering, gaze with deepest emotion, but immovable demeanor, into  one another's eyes, in which the expression of defiance to death  fades and melts into the glow of passion. Trembling seizes them,  they convulsively clutch their hearts and pass their hands over their  brows. Their glances again seek to meet, sink in confusion, and once  more turn with growing longing upon one another_.]    ISOLDA (_with trembling voice_). Tristan!    TRISTAN (_overpowered_). Isolda!    ISOLDA (_sinking upon his breast_). Traitor beloved!    TRISTAN. Woman divine!    (_He embraces her with ardor. They remain in a silent embrace_.)    ALL THE MEN (_without_). Hail! Hail!  Hail our monarch!  Hail to Mark, the king!    BRANGAENA (_who, filled with confusion and horror, has leaned over  the side with averted face, now turns to behold the pair locked in  their close embrace, and rushes to the front, wringing her hands in  despair_). Woe's me! Woe's me!  Endless mis'ry  I have wrought  instead of death!  Dire the deed  of my dull fond heart:  it cries aloud to heav'n!    (_They start from their embrace_.)    TRISTAN (_bewildered_). What troubled dream  of Tristan's honor?    ISOLDA. What troubled dream  Of Isolda's shame?    TRISTAN. Have I then lost thee?    ISOLDA. Have I repulsed thee?    TRISTAN. Fraudulent magic,  framing deceit!    BOTH. Languishing passion,  longing and growing,  love ever yearning,  loftiest glowing!  Rapture confess'd  rides in each breast!  Isolda! Tristan!  Tristan! Isolda!  World, I can shun thee  my love is won me!  Thou'rt my thought, all above:  highest delight of love!      SCENE VII.    [_The curtains are now drawn wide apart; the whole ship is covered  with knights and sailors, who, with shouts of joy, make signs  over towards the shore which is now seen to be quite near, with  castle-crowned cliffs. Tristan and Isolda remain absorbed in mutual  contemplation, perceiving nothing that is passing_.]    BRANGAENA (_to the women, who at her bidding ascend from below_).  Quick--the mantle!  the royal robe!--    (_Rushing between_ TRISTAN _and_ ISOLDA.)    Up, hapless ones!  See where we are!    (_She places the royal mantle on_ ISOLDA, _who notices nothing_.)    ALL THE MEN. Hail! Hail!  Hail our monarch!  Hail to Mark the king!    KURVENAL (_advancing gaily_). Hail, Tristan,  knight of good hap!  Behold King Mark approaching,  in a bark  with brave attendance.  Gladly he stems the tide,  coming to seek his bride.    TRISTAN (_looking up in bewilderment_). Who comes?    KURVENAL. The king 'tis.    TRISTAN. What king mean you?    (KURVENAL _points over the side_. TRISTAN _gazes stupefied at  the shore_.)    ALL THE MEN (_waving their hats_). Hail to King Mark!  All hail!    ISOLDA (_bewildered_). What is't, Brangaena?  What are those cries?    BRANGAENA. Isolda--mistress!  Compose thyself!    ISOLDA. Where am I! living?  What was that draught?    BRANGAENA (_despairingly_). The love-potion!    ISOLDA (_staring with horror at_ TRISTAN). Tristan!    TRISTAN. Isolda!    ISOLDA. Must I live, then?    (_Falls fainting upon his breast_.)    BRANGAENA (_to the women_). Look to your lady!    TRISTAN. O rapture fraught with cunning!  O fraud with bliss o'er-running!    ALL THE MEN (_in a general burst of acclamation_).  Hail to King Mark!  Cornwall, hail!    [_People have clambered over the ship's side, others have extended  a bridge, and the aspect of all indicates the immediate arrival of the  expected ones, as the curtain falls_.]          ACT II.    [_A Garden before ISOLDA'S Chamber which lies at one side and is  approached by steps. Bright and pleasant summer night. At the open  door a burning torch is fixed. Sounds of hunting heard_.]      SCENE I.    [BRANGAENA, _on the steps leading to the chamber, is watching the  retreat of the still audible hunters. She looks anxiously back into  the chamber as ISOLDA emerges thence in ardent animation_.]    ISOLDA. Yet do you hear?  I lost the sound some time.    BRANGAENA (_listening_). Still do they stay:  clearly rings the horns.    ISOLDA (_listening_). Fear but deludes  thy anxious ear;  by sounds of rustling  leaves thou'rt deceived,  aroused by laughter of winds.    BRANGAENA. Deceived by wild  desire art thou,  and but hear'st as would thy will:--  I still hear the sound of horns.    ISOLDA (_listens_). No sound of horns  were so sweet:  yon fountain's soft  murmuring current  moves so quietly hence.  If horns yet brayed,  how could I hear that?  In still night alone  it laughs on mine ear.  My lov'd one hides  in darkness unseen:  wouldst thou hold from my side my dearest?  deeming that horns thou hearest?    BRANGAENA. Thy lov'd one hid--  oh heed my warning!--  for him a spy waits by night.  Listening oft  I light upon him:  he lays a secret snare.  Of Melot oh beware!    ISOLDA. Mean you Sir Melot?  O, how you mistake!  Is he not Tristan's  trustiest friend?  May my true love not meet me,  with none but Melot he stays.    BRANGAENA. What moves me to fear him  makes thee his friend then?  Through Tristan to Mark's side  is Melot's way:  he sows suspicion's seed.  And those who have  to-day on a night-hunt  so suddenly decided,  a far nobler game  than is guessed by thee  taxes their hunting skill.    ISOLDA. For Tristan's sake  contrived was this scheme  by means of  Melot, in truth:  now would you decry his friendship?  He serves Isolda  better than you  his hand gives help  which yours denies:  what need of such delay?  The signal, Brangaena!  O give the signal!  Tread out the torch's  trembling gleam,  that night may envelop  all with her veil.  Already her peace reigns  o'er hill and hall,  her rapturous awe  the heart does enthral;  allow then the light to fall!  Let but its dread lustre die!  let my beloved draw nigh!    BRANGAENA. The light of warning suppress not!  Let it remind thee of peril!--  Ah, woe's me! Woe's me!  Fatal folly!  The fell pow'r of that potion!  That I framed  a fraud for once  thy orders to oppose!  Had I been deaf and blind,  thy work  were then thy death:  but thy distress,  thy distraction of grief,  my work  has contrived them, I own it!    ISOLDA. Thy--act?  O foolish girl!  Love's goddess dost thou not know?  nor all her magic arts?  The queen who grants  unquailing hearts,  the witch whose will  the world obeys,  life and death  she holds in her hands,  which of joy and woe are wove?  she worketh hate into love.  The work of death  I took into my own hands;  Love's goddess saw  and gave her good commands  The death--condemned  she claimed as her prey,  planning our fate  in her own way.  How she may bend it,  how she may end it,  what she may make me,  wheresoe'er take me,  still hers am I solely;--  so let me obey her wholly.    BRANGAENA. And if by the artful  love-potion's lures  thy light of reason is ravished,  if thou art reckless  when I would warn thee,  this once, oh, wait  and weigh my pleading!  I implore, leave it alight!--  The torch! the torch!  O put it not out this night!    ISOLDA. "]]]
