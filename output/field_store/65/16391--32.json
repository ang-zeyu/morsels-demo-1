To make a sheet of papyrus several of these strips  were laid side by side lengthwise, and several others were laid over  them crosswise. Thus each sheet of papyrus contained two layers, which  were joined together by means of glue and water or gum. Pliny, a Roman  writer, states (Bohn's edition, vol. iii. p. 189) that Nile water,  which, when in a muddy state, has the peculiar qualities of glue, was  used in fastening the two layers of strips together, but traces of gum  have actually been found on papyri. The sheets were next pressed and  then dried in the sun, and when rubbed with a hard polisher in order to  remove roughnesses, were ready for use.[1] By adding sheet to sheet,  rolls of papyrus of almost any length could be made. The longest roll in  the British Museum is 133 feet long by 16-1/2 inches high (Harris  Papyrus, No. 1), and the second in length is a copy of the Book of the  Dead, which is 123 feet long and 18-1/2 inches high; the latter contains  2666 lines of writing arranged in 172 columns. The rolls on which  ordinary compositions were written were much shorter and not so high,  for they are rarely more than 20 feet long, and are only from 8 to 10  inches in height.    [Illustration: Thoth and Amen-Ra Succouring Isis in the Papyrus Swamps.]    The scribe mixed on his palette the paints which he used. This palette  usually consisted of a piece of alabaster, wood, ivory, or slate, from 8  to 16 inches in length and from 2 to 3-1/2 inches in width; all four  corners were square. At one end of the palette a number of oval or  circular hollows were sunk to hold ink or paint. Down the middle was cut  a groove, square at one end and sloping at the other, in which the  writing reeds were placed. These were kept in position by a piece of  wood glued across the middle of the palette, or by a sliding cover,  which also served to protect the reeds from injury. On the sides of this  groove are often found inscriptions that give the name of the owner of  the palette, and that contain prayers to the gods for funerary  offerings, or invocations to Thoth, the inventor of the art of writing.  The black ink used by the scribes was made of lamp-black or of  finely-powdered charcoal mixed with water, to which a very small  quantity of gum was probably added. Red and yellow paint were made from  mineral earths or ochres, blue paint was made from lapis-lazuli powder,  green paint from sulphate of copper, and white paint from lime-white.  Sometimes the ink was placed in small wide-mouthed pots made of Egyptian  porcelain or alabaster. The scribe rubbed down his colours on a stone  slab with a small stone muller. The writing reed, which served as a pen,  was from 8 to 10 inches long, and from one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an  inch in diameter; the end used in writing was bruised and not cut. In  late times a very much thicker reed was used, and then the end was cut  like a quill or steel pen. Writing reeds of this kind were carried in  boxes of wood and metal specially made for the purpose. Many specimens  of all kinds of Egyptian writing materials are to be seen in the  Egyptian Rooms of the British Museum.    [Footnote 1: In some parts of Mesopotamia where scribes at the present  day use rough paper made in Russia, each sheet before being written upon  is laid upon a board and polished by means of a glass bottle.]    [Illustration: Wooden Palette of Rameri, an official of Thothmes IV.  1470 B.C. Wooden Palette of Aahmes I, King of Egypt 1600 B.C.]    As papyrus was expensive the pupils in the schools attached to the great  temples of Egypt wrote their exercises and copies of standard literary  compositions on slices of white limestone of fine texture, or upon  boards, in the shape of modern slates used in schools, whitened with  lime. The \"copies\" from which they worked were written by the teacher on  limestone slabs of somewhat larger size. Copies of the texts that masons  cut upon the walls of temples and other monuments were also written on  slabs of this kind, and when figures of kings or gods were to be  sculptured on the walls their proportions were indicated by  perpendicular and horizontal lines drawn to scale. Portions of broken  earthen-ware pots were also used for practising writing upon, and in the  Ptolemaic and Roman Periods lists of goods, and business letters, and  the receipts given by the tax-gatherers, were written upon potsherds. In  still later times, when skin or parchment was as expensive as papyrus,  the Copts, or Egyptian Christians, used slices of limestone and  potsherds for drafts of portions of the Scriptures and letters in much  the same way as did their ancestors.    A roll of papyrus when not in use was kept in shape by a string or piece  of papyrus cord, which was tied in a bow; sometimes, especially in the  case of legal documents, a clay seal bearing the owner's name was  stamped on the cord. Valuable rolls were kept in wooden cases or \"book  boxes,\" which were deposited in a chamber or \"house\" set apart for the  purpose, which was commonly called the \"house of books,\" _i.e._ the  library. Having now described the principal writing materials used by  the ancient Egyptians, we may pass on to consider briefly the various  classes of Egyptian Literature that have come down to us.                                         CHAPTER II                                THE PYRAMID TEXTS      \"Pyramid Texts\" is the name now commonly given to the long hieroglyphic  inscriptions that are cut upon the walls of the chambers and corridors  of five pyramids at Sakkarah. The oldest of them was built for Unas, a  king of the fifth dynasty, and the four others were built for Teta, Pepi  I, Merenra, and Pepi II, kings of the sixth dynasty. According to the  calculation of Dr. Brugsch, they were all built between 3300 and 3150  B.C., but more recent theories assign them to a period about 700 years  later. These Texts represent the oldest religious literature known to  us, for they contain beliefs, dogmas, and ideas that must be thousands  of years older than the period of the sixth dynasty when the bulk of  them was drafted for the use of the masons who cut them inside the  pyramids. It is probable that certain sections of them were composed by  the priests for the benefit of the dead in very primitive times in  Egypt, when the art of writing was unknown, and that they were repeated  each time a king died. They were first learned by heart by the funerary  priests, and then handed on from mouth to mouth, generation after  generation, and at length after the Egyptians had learned to write, and  there was danger of their being forgotten, they were committed to  writing. And just as these certain sections were absorbed into the great  body of Pyramid Texts of the sixth dynasty, so portions of the Texts of  the sixth dynasty were incorporated into the great Theban Book of the  Dead, and they appear in papyri that were written more than 2000 years  later. The Pyramid Texts supply us with much information concerning the  religious beliefs of the primitive Egyptians, and also with many  isolated facts of history that are to be found nowhere else, but of the  meaning of a very large number of passages we must always remain  ignorant, because they describe states of civilisation, and conditions  of life and climate, of which no modern person can form any true  conception. Besides this the meanings of many words are unknown, the  spelling is strange and often inexplicable, the construction of the  sentence is frequently unlike anything known in later texts, and the  ideas that they express are wholly foreign to the minds of students of  to-day, who are in every way aliens to the primitive Egyptian African  whose beliefs these words represent. The pyramids at Sakkarah in which  the Pyramid Texts are found were discovered by the Frenchman, Mariette,  in 1880. Paper casts of the inscriptions, which are deeply cut in the  walls and painted green, were made for Professor Maspero, the Director  of the Service of Antiquities in Egypt, and from these he printed an  edition in hieroglyphic type of all five texts, and added a French  translation of the greater part of them. Professor Maspero correctly  recognised the true character of these old-world documents, and his  translation displayed an unrivalled insight into the true meaning of  many sections of them. The discovery and study of other texts and the  labours of recent workers have cleared up passages that offered  difficulties to him, but his work will remain for a very long time the  base of all investigations.    The Pyramid Texts, and the older texts quoted or embodied in them, were  written, like every religious funerary work in Egypt, for the benefit of  the king, that is to say, to effect his glorious resurrection and to  secure for him happiness in the Other World, and life everlasting. They  were intended to make him become a king in the Other World as he had  been a king upon earth; in other words, he was to reign over the gods,  and to have control of all the powers of heaven, and to have the power  to command the spirits and souls of the righteous, as his ancestors the  kings of Egypt had ruled their bodies when they lived on earth. The  Egyptians found that their king, who was an incarnation of the \"Great  God,\" died like other men, and they feared that, even if they succeeded  in effecting his resurrection by means of the Pyramid Texts, he might  die a second time in the Other World. They spared no effort and left no  means untried to make him not only a \"living soul\" in the Tuat, or Other  World, but to keep him alive there. The object of every prayer, every  spell, every hymn, and every incantation contained in these Texts, was  to preserve the king's life. This might be done in many ways.

At such times they fear little, and even lay aside their usual  caution. I remember trailing a large herd one day from early morning,  keeping near them all the time, and jumping them half a dozen times,  yet never getting a glimpse because of their extreme watchfulness. For  some reason they were unwilling to leave a small chain of barrens.  Perhaps they knew the storm was coming, when they would be safe; and  so, instead of swinging off into a ten-mile straightaway trot at the  first alarm, they kept dodging back and forth within a two-mile  circle. At last, late in the afternoon, I followed the trail to the  edge of dense evergreen thickets. Caribou generally rest in open woods  or on the windward edge of a barren. Eyes for the open, nose for the  cover, is their motto. And I thought, \"They know perfectly well I am  following them, and so have lain down in that tangle. If I go in, they  will hear me; a wood mouse could hardly keep quiet in such a place. If  I go round, they will catch my scent; if I wait, so will they; if I  jump them, the scrub will cover their retreat perfectly.\"    As I sat down in the snow to think it over, a heavy rush deep within  the thicket told me that something, not I certainly, had again started  them. Suddenly the air darkened, and above the excitement of the hunt  I felt the storm coming. A storm in the woods is no joke when you are  six miles from camp without axe or blanket. I broke away from the  trail and started for the head of the second barren on the run. If I  could make that, I was safe; for there was a stream near, which led  near to camp; and one cannot very well lose a stream, even in a  snowstorm. But before I was halfway the flakes were driving thick and  soft in my face. Another half-mile, and one could not see fifty feet  in any direction. Still I kept on, holding my course by the wind and  my compass. Then, at the foot of the second barren, my snowshoes  stumbled into great depressions in the snow, and I found myself on the  fresh trail of my caribou again. \"If I am lost, I will at least have a  caribou steak, and a skin to wrap me up in,\" I said, and plunged after  them. As I went, the old Mother Goose rhyme of nursery days came back  and set itself to hunting music:      Bye, baby bunting,    Daddy's gone a hunting,    For to catch a rabbit skin    To wrap the baby bunting in.    Presently I began to sing it aloud. It cheered one up in the storm,  and the lilt of it kept time to the leaping kind of gallop which is  the easiest way to run on snowshoes: \"Bye, baby bunting; bye, baby  bunting--Hello!\"    A dark mass loomed suddenly up before me on the open barren. The storm  lightened a bit, before setting in heavier; and there were the caribou  just in front of me, standing in a compact mass, the weaker ones in  the middle. They had no thought nor fear of me apparently; they  showed no sign of anger or uneasiness. Indeed, they barely moved aside  as I snowshoed up, in plain sight, without any precaution whatever.  And these were the same animals that had fled upon my approach at  daylight, and that had escaped me all day with marvelous cunning.    As with other deer, the storm is Megaleep's natural protector. When it  comes he thinks that he is safe; that nobody can see him; that the  falling snow will fill his tracks and kill his scent; and that  whatever follows must speedily seek cover for itself. So he gives up  watching, and lies down where he will. So far as his natural enemies  are concerned, he is safe in this; for lynx and wolf and panther, seek  shelter with a falling barometer. They can neither see nor smell; and  they are all afraid. I have often noticed that among all animals and  birds, from the least to the greatest, there is always a truce when  the storms are out.    But the most curious thing I ever stumbled into was a caribou school.  That sounds queer; but it is more common in the wilderness than one  thinks. All gregarious animals have perfectly well defined social  regulations, which the young must learn and respect. To learn them,  they go to school in their own interesting way.    The caribou I am speaking of now are all woodland caribou--larger,  finer animals every way than the barren-ground caribou of the desolate  unwooded regions farther north. In summer they live singly, rearing  their young in deep forest seclusions. There each one does as he  pleases. So when you meet a caribou in summer, he is a different  creature, and has more unknown and curious ways than when he runs with  the herd in midwinter. I remember a solitary old bull that lived on  the mountain-side opposite my camp one summer, a most interesting  mixture of fear and boldness, of reserve and intense curiosity. After  I had hunted him a few times, and he found that my purpose was wholly  peaceable, he took to hunting me in the same way, just to find out who  I was, and what queer thing I was doing. Sometimes I would see him at  sunset on a dizzy cliff across the lake, watching for the curl of  smoke or the coming of a canoe. And when I dove in for a swim and went  splashing, dog-paddle way, about the island where my tent was, he  would walk about in the greatest excitement, and start a dozen times  to come down; but always he ran back for another look, as if  fascinated. Again he would come down on a burned point near the deep  hole where I was fishing, and, hiding his body in the underbrush,  would push his horns up into the bare branches of a withered shrub,  so as to make them inconspicuous, and stand watching me. As long as he  was quiet, it was impossible to see him there; but I could always make  him start nervously by flashing a looking-glass, or flopping a fish in  the water, or whistling a jolly Irish jig. And when I tied a bright  tomato can to a string and set it whirling round my head, or set my  handkerchief for a flag on the end of my trout rod, then he could not  stand it another minute, but came running down to the shore, to stamp,  and fidget, and stare nervously, and scare himself with twenty alarms  while trying to make up his mind to swim out and satisfy his burning  desire to know all about it. But I am forgetting the caribou schools.    Wherever there are barrens--treeless plains in the midst of dense  forest--the caribou collect in small herds as winter comes on,  following the old gregarious instinct. Then each one cannot do as he  pleases any more; and it is for this winter and spring life together,  when laws must be known, and the rights of the individual be laid  aside for the good of the herd, that the young are trained.    One afternoon in late summer I was drifting down the Toledi River,  casting for trout, when a movement in the bushes ahead caught my  attention. A great swampy tract of ground, covered with grass and low  brush, spread out on either side the stream. From the canoe I made out  two or three waving lines of bushes where some animals were making  their way through the swamp towards a strip of big timber which formed  a kind of island in the middle.    Pushing my canoe into the grass, I made for a point just astern of the  nearest quivering line of bushes. A glance at a bit of soft ground  showed me the trail of a mother caribou with her calf. I followed  cautiously, the wind being ahead in my favor. They were not hurrying,  and I took good pains not to alarm them.    When I reached the timber and crept like a snake through the  underbrush, there were the caribou, five or six mother animals, and  nearly twice as many little ones, well grown, which had evidently just  come in from all directions. They were gathered in a natural opening,  fairly clear of bushes, with a fallen tree or two, which served a good  purpose later. The sunlight fell across it in great golden bars,  making light and shadow to play in; all around was the great marsh,  giving protection from enemies; dense underbrush screened them from  prying eyes--and this was their schoolroom.    The little ones were pushed out into the middle, away from the  mothers to whom they clung instinctively, and were left to get  acquainted with each other, which they did very shyly at first, like  so many strange children. It was all new and curious, this meeting of  their kind; for till now they had lived in dense solitudes, each one  knowing no living creature save its own mother. Some were timid, and  backed away as far as possible into the shadow, looking with wild,  wide eyes from one to another of the little caribou, and bolting to  their mothers' sides at every unusual movement. Others were bold, and  took to butting at the first encounter. But careful, kindly eyes  watched over them. Now and then a mother caribou would come from the  shadows and push a little one gently from his retreat under a bush out  into the company. Another would push her way between two heads that  lowered at each other threateningly, and say with a warning shake of  her head that butting was no good way to get along together. I had  once thought, watching a herd on the barrens through my glasses, that  they are the gentlest of animals with each other. Here in the little  school in the heart of the swamp I found the explanation of things.    For over an hour I lay there and watched, my curiosity growing more  eager every moment; for most of what I saw I could not comprehend,  having no key, nor understanding why certain youngsters, who needed  reproof according to my standards, were let alone, and others kept  moving constantly, and still others led aside often to be talked to by  their mothers. But at last came a lesson in which all joined, and  which could not be misunderstood, not even by a man. It was the  jumping lesson.    Caribou are naturally poor jumpers. Beside a deer, who often goes out  of his way to jump a fallen tree just for the fun of it, they have no  show whatever; though they can travel much farther in a day"]]]
