[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#3)"],[1," and the like of our  world's expositions that the streets of Port Said looked like Midways  raised to the nth power. Along them we sauntered with a pleasing feeling  of self-importance. On all sides we were gently and humbly besought--by  the shopkeepers, by the sidewalk vendors, by would-be guides, by  fortune-tellers, by jugglers, by magicians; all soft-voiced and  respectful; all yielding as water to rebuff, but as quick as water to  glide back again. The vendors were of the colours of the rainbow, and  were heavily hung with long necklaces of coral or amber, with scarves,  with strings of silver coins, with sequinned veils and silks, girt with  many dirks and knives, furnished out in concealed pockets with scarabs,  bracelets, sandalwood boxes or anything else under the broad canopy of  heaven one might or might not desire. Their voices were soft and  pleasing, their eyes had the beseeching quality of a good dog's, their  anxious and deprecating faces were ready at the slightest encouragement  to break out into the friendliest and most intimate of smiles. Wherever  we went we were accompanied by a retinue straight out of the Arabian  Nights, patiently awaiting the moment when we should tire; should seek  out the table of a sidewalk cafe; and should, in our relaxed mood, be  ready to unbend to our royal purchases.    At that moment we were too much interested in the town itself. The tiny  shops, with their smiling and insinuating Oriental keepers, were  fascinating in their displays of carved woods, jewellery, perfumes,  silks, tapestries, silversmiths' work, ostrich feathers, and the like.  To either side the main street lay long narrow dark alleys, in which  flared single lights, across which flitted mysterious long-robed  figures, from which floated stray snatches of music either palpitatingly  barbaric or ridiculously modern. There the authority of the straight,  soldierly-looking Soudanese policemen ceased, and it was not safe to  wander unarmed or alone.    Besides these motley variegations of the East and West, the main feature  of the town was the street car. It was an open-air structure of spacious  dimensions, as though benches and a canopy had been erected rather  haphazard on a small dancing platform. The track is absurdly narrow in  gauge; and as a consequence the edifice swayed and swung from side to  side. A single mule was attached to it loosely by about ten feet of  rope. It was driven by a gaudy ragamuffin in a turban. Various other  gaudy ragamuffins lounged largely and picturesquely on the widely spaced  benches. Whence it came or whither it went I do not know. Its orbit  swung into the main street, turned a corner, and disappeared. Apparently  Europeans did not patronize this picturesque wreck, but drove elegantly  but mysteriously in small open cabs conducted by totally incongruous  turbaned drivers.    We ended finally at an imposing corner hotel, where we dined by an open  window just above the level of the street. A dozen upturned faces  besought us silently during the meal. At a glance of even the mildest  interest a dozen long brown arms thrust the spoils of the East upon our  consideration. With us sat a large benign Swedish professor whose  erudition was encyclopaedic, but whose kindly humanity was greater.  Uttering deep, cavernous chuckles, the professor bargained. A red coral  necklace for the moment was the matter of interest. The professor  inspected it carefully, and handed it back.    \"I doubt if id iss coral,\" said he simply.    The present owner of the beads went frantic with rapid-fire proof and  vociferation. With the swiftness and precision of much repetition he  fished out a match, struck it, applied the flame to the alleged coral,  and blew out the match; cast the necklace on the pavement, produced  mysteriously a small hammer, and with it proceeded frantically to pound  the beads. Evidently he was accustomed to being doubted, and carried his  materials for proof around with him. Then, in one motion, the hammer  disappeared, the beads were snatched up, and again offered, unharmed,  for inspection.    \"Are those good tests for genuineness?\" we asked the professor, aside.    \"As to that,\" he replied regretfully, \"I do not know. I know of coral  only that is the hard calcareous skeleton of the marine coelenterate  polyps; and that this red coral iss called of a sclerobasic group; and  other facts of the kind; but I do not know if it iss supposed to resist  impact and heat. Possibly,\" he ended shrewdly, \"it is the common  imitation which does _not_ resist impact and heat. At any rate they are  pretty. How much?\" he demanded of the vendor, a bright-eyed Egyptian  waiting patiently until our conference should cease.    \"Twenty shillings,\" he replied promptly.    The professor shook with one of his cavernous chuckles.    \"Too much,\" he observed, and handed the necklace back through the  window.    The Egyptian would by no means receive it.    \"Keep! keep!\" he implored, thrusting the mass of red upon the professor  with both hands. \"How much you give?\"    \"One shilling,\" announced the professor firmly.    The coral necklace lay on the edge of the table throughout most of our  leisurely meal. The vendor argued, pleaded, gave it up, disappeared in  the crowd, returned dramatically after an interval. The professor ate  calmly, chuckled much, and from time to time repeated firmly the words,  \"One shilling.\" Finally, at the cheese, he reached out, swept the coral  into his pocket, and laid down two shillings. The Egyptian deftly  gathered the coin, smiled cheerfully, and produced a glittering veil, in  which he tried in vain to enlist Billy's interest.    For coffee and cigars we moved to the terrace outside. Here an orchestra  played, the peoples of many nations sat at little tables, the peddlers,  fakirs, jugglers, and fortune-tellers swarmed. A half-dozen postal cards  seemed sufficient to set a small boy up in trade, and to imbue him with  all the importance and insistence of a merchant with jewels. Other  ten-year-old ragamuffins tried to call our attention to some sort of  sleight-of-hand with poor downy little chickens. Grave, turbaned, and  polite Indians squatted cross-legged at our feet, begging to give us a  look into the future by means of the only genuine hall-marked Yogi-ism;  a troupe of acrobats went energetically and hopefully through quite a  meritorious performance a few feet away; a deftly triumphant juggler did  very easily, and directly beneath our watchful eyes, some really  wonderful tricks. A butterfly-gorgeous swarm of insinuating smiling  peddlers of small things dangled and spread their wares where they  thought themselves most sure of attention. Beyond our own little group  we saw slowly passing in the lighted street outside the portico the  variegated and picturesque loungers. Across the way a phonograph bawled;  our stringed orchestra played \"The Dollar Princess;\" from somewhere over  in the dark and mysterious alleyways came the regular beating of a  tom-tom. The magnificent and picturesque town car with its gaudy  ragamuffins swayed by in train of its diminutive mule.    Suddenly our persistent and amusing _entourage_ vanished in all  directions. Standing idly at the portico was a very straight, black  Soudanese. On his head was the usual red fez; his clothing was of trim  khaki; his knees and feet were bare, with blue puttees between; and  around his middle was drawn close and smooth a blood-red sash at least a  foot and a half in breadth. He made a fine upstanding Egyptian figure,  and was armed with pride, a short sheathed club, and a great scorn. No  word spoke he, nor command; but merely jerked a thumb towards the  darkness, and into the darkness our many-hued horde melted away. We were  left feeling rather lonesome!    Near midnight we sauntered down the street to the quay, whence we were  rowed to the ship by another turbaned, long-robed figure, who sweetly  begged just a copper or so \"for poor boatman.\"    We found the ship in the process of coaling, every porthole and doorway  closed, and heavy canvas hung to protect as far as possible the clean  decks. Two barges were moored alongside. Two blazing braziers lighted  them with weird red and flickering flames. In their depths, cast in  black and red shadows, toiled half-guessed figures; from their depths,  mounting a single steep plank, came an unbroken procession of natives,  naked save for a wisp of cloth around the loins. They trod closely on  each other's heels, carrying each his basket atop his head or on one  shoulder, mounted a gang-plank, discharged their loads into the side of  the ship, and descended again to the depths by way of another plank. The  lights flickered across their dark faces, their gleaming teeth and eyes.  Somehow the work demanded a heap of screeching, shouting, and  gesticulation; but somehow also it went forward rapidly. Dozens of  unattached natives lounged about the gunwales with apparently nothing to  do but to look picturesque. Shore boats moved into the narrow circle of  light, drifted to our gangway, and discharged huge crates of vegetables,  sacks of unknown stuffs, and returning passengers. A vigilant police  boat hovered near to settle disputes, generally with the blade of an  oar. For a long time we leaned over the rail watching them, and the  various reflected lights in the water, and the very clear, unwavering  stars. Then, the coaling finished, and the portholes once more opened,  we turned in.          IV.    SUEZ.      Some time during the night we must have started, but so gently had we  slid along it fractional speed that until I raised my head and looked  out I had not realized the fact. I saw a high sandbank. This glided  monotonously by until I grew tired of looking at it and got up.    After breakfast, however, I found that the sandbank had various  attractions all of its own.

No, Lord! I find them still as bad as bad can be.  Poor souls! their miseries seem so much to please 'em,  I scarce can find it in my heart to tease 'em.    _The Lord_. Knowest thou Faust?    _Mephistopheles_. The Doctor?    _The Lord_. Ay, my servant!    _Mephistopheles_.        He!  Forsooth! he serves you in a famous fashion;  No earthly meat or drink can feed his passion;  Its grasping greed no space can measure;  Half-conscious and half-crazed, he finds no rest;  The fairest stars of heaven must swell his treasure.  Each highest joy of earth must yield its zest,  Not all the world--the boundless azure--  Can fill the void within his craving breast.    _The Lord_. He serves me somewhat darkly, now, I grant,  Yet will he soon attain the light of reason.  Sees not the gardener, in the green young plant,  That bloom and fruit shall deck its coming season?    _Mephistopheles_. What will you bet? You'll surely lose your wager!  If you will give me leave henceforth,  To lead him softly on, like an old stager.    _The Lord_. So long as he shall live on earth,  Do with him all that you desire.  Man errs and staggers from his birth.    _Mephistopheles_. Thank you; I never did aspire  To have with dead folk much transaction.  In full fresh cheeks I take the greatest satisfaction.  A corpse will never find me in the house;  I love to play as puss does with the mouse.    _The Lord_. All right, I give thee full permission!  Draw down this spirit from its source,  And, canst thou catch him, to perdition  Carry him with thee in thy course,  But stand abashed, if thou must needs confess,  That a good man, though passion blur his vision,  Has of the right way still a consciousness.    _Mephistopheles_. Good! but I'll make it a short story.  About my wager I'm by no means sorry.  And if I gain my end with glory  Allow me to exult from a full breast.  Dust shall he eat and that with zest,  Like my old aunt, the snake, whose fame is hoary.    _The Lord_. Well, go and come, and make thy trial;  The like of thee I never yet did hate.  Of all the spirits of denial  The scamp is he I best can tolerate.  Man is too prone, at best, to seek the way that's easy,  He soon grows fond of unconditioned rest;  And therefore such a comrade suits him best,  Who spurs and works, true devil, always busy.  But you, true sons of God, in growing measure,  Enjoy rich beauty's living stores of pleasure!  The Word[3] divine that lives and works for aye,  Fold you in boundless love's embrace alluring,  And what in floating vision glides away,  That seize ye and make fast with thoughts enduring.    [_Heaven closes, the archangels disperse._]    _Mephistopheles. [Alone.]_ I like at times to exchange with him a word,  And take care not to break with him. 'Tis civil  In the old fellow[4] and so great a Lord  To talk so kindly with the very devil.              FAUST.          _Night. In a narrow high-arched Gothic room_,      FAUST _sitting uneasy at his desk_.    _Faust_. Have now, alas! quite studied through  Philosophy and Medicine,  And Law, and ah! Theology, too,  With hot desire the truth to win!  And here, at last, I stand, poor fool!  As wise as when I entered school;  Am called Magister, Doctor, indeed,--  Ten livelong years cease not to lead  Backward and forward, to and fro,  My scholars by the nose--and lo!  Just nothing, I see, is the sum of our learning,  To the very core of my heart 'tis burning.  'Tis true I'm more clever than all the foplings,  Doctors, Magisters, Authors, and Popelings;  Am plagued by no scruple, nor doubt, nor cavil,  Nor lingering fear of hell or devil--  What then? all pleasure is fled forever;  To know one thing I vainly endeavor,  There's nothing wherein one fellow-creature  Could be mended or bettered with me for a teacher.  And then, too, nor goods nor gold have I,  Nor fame nor worldly dignity,--  A condition no dog could longer live in!  And so to magic my soul I've given,  If, haply, by spirits' mouth and might,  Some mysteries may not be brought to light;  That to teach, no longer may be my lot,  With bitter sweat, what I need to be taught;  That I may know what the world contains  In its innermost heart and finer veins,  See all its energies and seeds  And deal no more in words but in deeds.    O full, round Moon, didst thou but thine  For the last time on this woe of mine!  Thou whom so many a midnight I  Have watched, at this desk, come up the sky:  O'er books and papers, a dreary pile,  Then, mournful friend! uprose thy smile!  Oh that I might on the mountain-height,  Walk in the noon of thy blessed light,  Round mountain-caverns with spirits hover,  Float in thy gleamings the meadows over,  And freed from the fumes of a lore-crammed brain,  Bathe in thy dew and be well again!    Woe! and these walls still prison me?  Dull, dismal hole! my curse on thee!  Where heaven's own light, with its blessed beams,  Through painted panes all sickly gleams!  Hemmed in by these old book-piles tall,  Which, gnawed by worms and deep in must,  Rise to the roof against a wall  Of smoke-stained paper, thick with dust;  'Mid glasses, boxes, where eye can see,  Filled with old, obsolete instruments,  Stuffed with old heirlooms of implements--  That is thy world! There's a world for thee!    And still dost ask what stifles so  The fluttering heart within thy breast?  By what inexplicable woe  The springs of life are all oppressed?  Instead of living nature, where  God made and planted men, his sons,  Through smoke and mould, around thee stare  Grim skeletons and dead men's bones.    Up! Fly! Far out into the land!  And this mysterious volume, see!  By Nostradamus's[5] own hand,  Is it not guide enough for thee?  Then shalt thou thread the starry skies,  And, taught by nature in her walks,  The spirit's might shall o'er thee rise,  As ghost to ghost familiar talks.  Vain hope that mere dry sense should here  Explain the holy signs to thee.  I feel you, spirits, hovering near;  Oh, if you hear me, answer me!          [_He opens the book and beholds the sign of the Macrocosm.[_6]]  Ha! as I gaze, what ecstasy is this,  In one full tide through all my senses flowing!  I feel a new-born life, a holy bliss  Through nerves and veins mysteriously glowing.  Was it a God who wrote each sign?  Which, all my inner tumult stilling,  And this poor heart with rapture filling,  Reveals to me, by force divine,  Great Nature's energies around and through me thrilling?  Am I a God? It grows so bright to me!  Each character on which my eye reposes  Nature in act before my soul discloses.  The sage's word was truth, at last I see:  \"The spirit-world, unbarred, is waiting;  Thy sense is locked, thy heart is dead!  Up, scholar, bathe, unhesitating,  The earthly breast in morning-red!\"                             [_He contemplates the sign._]  How all one whole harmonious weaves,  Each in the other works and lives!  See heavenly powers ascending and descending,  The golden buckets, one long line, extending!  See them with bliss-exhaling pinions winging  Their way from heaven through earth--their singing  Harmonious through the universe is ringing!    Majestic show! but ah! a show alone!  Nature! where find I thee, immense, unknown?  Where you, ye breasts? Ye founts all life sustaining,  On which hang heaven and earth, and where  Men's withered hearts their waste repair--  Ye gush, ye nurse, and I must sit complaining?    [_He opens reluctantly the book and sees the sign of the earth-spirit._]  How differently works on me this sign!  Thou, spirit of the earth, art to me nearer;  I feel my powers already higher, clearer,  I glow already as with new-pressed wine,  I feel the mood to brave life's ceaseless clashing,  To bear its frowning woes, its raptures flashing,  To mingle in the tempest's dashing,  And not to tremble in the shipwreck's crashing;  Clouds gather o'er my head--  Them moon conceals her light--  The lamp goes out!  It smokes!--Red rays are darting, quivering  Around my head--comes down  A horror from the vaulted roof  And seizes me!  Spirit that I invoked, thou near me art,  Unveil thyself!  Ha! what a tearing in my heart!  Upheaved like an ocean  My senses toss with strange emotion!  I feel my heart to thee entirely given!  Thou must! and though the price were life--were heaven!    [_He seizes the book and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit.     A ruddy flame darts out, the spirit appears in the flame._]    _Spirit_. Who calls upon me?    _Faust. [Turning away.]_ Horrid sight!    _Spirit_. Long have I felt the mighty action,  Upon my sphere, of thy attraction,  And now--    _Faust_.   Away, intolerable sprite!    _Spirit_. Thou breath'st a panting supplication  To hear my voice, my face to see;  Thy mighty prayer prevails on me,  I come!--what miserable agitation  Seizes this demigod! Where is the cry of thought?  Where is the breast? that in itself a world begot,  And bore and cherished, that with joy did tremble  And fondly dream us spirits to resemble.  Where art thou, Faust? whose voice rang through my ear,  Whose mighty yearning drew me from my sphere?  Is this thing thou? that, blasted by my breath,  Through all life's windings shuddereth,  A shrinking, cringing, writhing worm!    _Faust_. Thee, flame-born creature, shall I fear?  'Tis I, 'tis Faust, behold thy peer!    _Spirit_. In life's tide currents, in action's storm,  Up and down, like a wave,  Like the wind I sweep!  Cradle and grave--  A limitless deep---  An endless weaving  To and fro,  A restless heaving  Of life and glow,--  So shape I, on Destiny's thundering loom,  The Godhead's live garment, eternal in bloom.    _Faust_. Spirit that sweep'st the world from end to end,  How near, this hour, I feel myself to thee!    _Spirit_. Thou'rt like the spirit thou canst comprehend,  Not me!             [_Vanishes._]    _Faust_. [_Collapsing_.] Not thee?    Whom then?    I, image of the Godhead,   "]]]
