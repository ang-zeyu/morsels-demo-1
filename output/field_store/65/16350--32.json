A true  knife-grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket  feels money in it! But what a fine goose you have got; where did you buy  it?\"    \"I did not buy it at all,\" said Hans, \"but took it in exchange for my  pig.\" \"And the pig?\" \"I exchanged for my cow.\" \"And the cow?\" \"I  exchanged a horse for her.\" \"And the horse?\" \"For him I gave a lump of  gold as big as my head.\" \"And the gold?\" \"That was my wages for a seven  years' servitude.\" \"And I see you have known how to benefit yourself  each time,\" said the Grinder; \"but, could you now manage that you heard  the money rattling in your pocket as you walked, your fortune would be  made.\"    \"Well! how shall I manage that?\" asked Hans.    \"You must become a grinder like me; to this trade nothing peculiar  belongs but a grindstone; the other necessaries find themselves. Here is  one which is a little worn, certainly, and so I will not ask anything  more for it than your goose; are you agreeable?\"    \"How can you ask me?\" said Hans; \"why, I shall be the luckiest man in  the world; having money as often as I dip my hand into my pocket, what  have I to care about any longer?\"    So saying, he handed over the goose, and received the grindstone in  exchange.    \"Now,\" said the Grinder, picking up an ordinary big flint stone which  lay near, \"now, there you have a capital stone upon which only beat them  long enough and you may straighten all your old nails! Take it, and use  it carefully!\"    Hans took the stone and walked on with a satisfied heart, his eyes  glistening with joy. \"I must have been born,\" said he, \"to a heap of  luck; everything happens just as I wish, as if I were a Sunday-child.\"    Soon, however, having been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel  very tired, and was plagued too with hunger, since he had eaten all his  provision at once in his joy about the cow bargain. At last he felt  quite unable to go farther, and was forced, too, to halt every minute  for the stones encumbered him very much. Just then the thought overcame  him, what a good thing it were if he had no need to carry them any  longer, and at the same moment he came up to a stream. Here he resolved  to rest and refresh himself with drink, and so that the stones might not  hurt him in kneeling he laid them carefully down by his side on the  bank. This done, he stooped down to scoop up some water in his hand, and  then it happened that he pushed one stone a little too far, so that both  presently went plump into the water. Hans, as soon as he saw them  sinking to the bottom, jumped up for joy, and then kneeled down and  returned thanks, with tears in his eyes, that so mercifully, and without  any act on his part, and in so nice a way, he had been delivered from  the heavy stones, which alone hindered him from getting on.    \"So lucky as I am,\" exclaimed Hans, \"is no other man under the sun!\"    Then with a light heart, and free from every burden, he leaped gaily  along till he reached his mother's house.          II    WHY THE SEA IS SALT      Once on a time, but it was a long, long time ago, there were two  brothers, one rich and one poor. Now, one Christmas eve, the poor one  hadn't so much as a crumb in the house, either of meat or bread, so he  went to his brother to ask him for something to keep Christmas with, in  God's name. It was not the first time his brother had been forced to  help him, and you may fancy he wasn't very glad to see his face, but he  said:    \"If you will do what I ask you to do, I'll give you a whole flitch of  bacon.\"    So the poor brother said he would do anything and was full of thanks.    \"Well, here is the flitch,\" said the rich brother, \"and now go straight  to Hell.\"    \"What I have given my word to do, I must stick to,\" said the other; so  he took the flitch and set off. He walked the whole day, and at dusk he  came to a place where he saw a very bright light.    \"Maybe this is the place,\" said the man to himself. So he turned aside,  and the first thing he saw was an old, old man, with a long white beard,  who stood in an outhouse, hewing wood for the Christmas fire.    \"Good even,\" said the man with the flitch.    \"The same to you; whither are you going so late?\" said the man.    \"Oh! I'm going to Hell, if I only knew the right way,\" answered the poor  man.    \"Well, you're not far wrong, for this is Hell,\" said the old man; \"when  you get inside they will be all for buying your flitch, for meat is  scarce in Hell; but, mind you don't sell it unless you get the  hand-quern which stands behind the door for it. When you come out, I'll  teach you how to handle the quern, for it's good to grind almost  anything.\"    So the man with the flitch thanked the other for his good advice, and  gave a great knock at the Devil's door.    When he got in, everything was just as the old man had said. All the  devils, great and small, came swarming up to him like ants round an  anthill, and each tried to outbid the other for the flitch.    \"Well!\" said the man, \"by rights, my old dame and I ought to have this  flitch for our Christmas dinner; but since you have all set your hearts  on it, I suppose I must give it up to you; but if I sell it at all, I'll  have for it the quern behind the door yonder.\"    At first the Devil wouldn't hear of such a bargain, and chaffed and  haggled with the man; but he stuck to what he said, and at last the  Devil had to part with his quern. When the man got out into the yard, he  asked the old woodcutter how he was to handle the quern; and after he  had learned how to use it, he thanked the old man and went off home as  fast as he could, but still the clock had struck twelve on Christmas eve  before he reached his own door.    \"Wherever in the world have you been?\" said his old dame; \"here have I  sat hour after hour waiting and watching, without so much as two sticks  to lay together under the Christmas brose.\"    \"Oh!\" said the man, \"I couldn't get back before, for I had to go a long  way first for one thing, and then for another; but now you shall see  what you shall see.\"    So he put the quern on the table, and bade it first of all grind lights,  then a table-cloth, then meat, then ale, and so on till they had got  everything that was nice for Christmas fare. He had only to speak the  word, and the quern ground out what he wanted. The old dame stood by  blessing her stars, and kept on asking where he had got this wonderful  quern, but he wouldn't tell her.    \"It's all one where I got it from; you see the quern is a good one, and  the mill-stream never freezes, that's enough.\"    So he ground meat and drink and dainties enough to last out till Twelfth  Day, and on the third day he asked all his friends and kin to his house,  and gave a great feast. Now, when his rich brother saw all that was on  the table, and all that was behind in the larder, he grew quite spiteful  and wild, for he couldn't bear that his brother should have anything.    \"Twas only on Christmas eve,\" he said to the rest, \"he was in such  straits that he came and asked for a morsel of food in God's name, and  now he gives a feast as if he were count or king;\" and he turned to his  brother and said:    \"But whence, in Hell's name, have you got all this wealth?\"    \"From behind the door,\" answered the owner of the quern, for he didn't  care to let the cat out of the bag. But later on in the evening, when he  had got a drop too much, he could keep his secret no longer, and brought  out the quern and said:    \"There, you see what has gotten me all this wealth;\" and so he made the  quern grind all kind of things. When his brother saw it, he set his  heart on having the quern, and, after a deal of coaxing, he got it; but  he had to pay three hundred dollars for it, and his brother bargained to  keep it till hay-harvest, for he thought, if I keep it till then, I can  make it grind meat and drink that will last for years. So you may fancy  the quern didn't grow rusty for want of work, and when hay-harvest came,  the rich brother got it, but the other took care not to teach him how to  handle it.    It was evening when the rich brother got the quern home, and the next  morning he told his wife to go out into the hay-field and toss, while  the mowers cut the grass, and he would stay at home and get the dinner  ready. So, when dinner-time drew near, he put the quern on the kitchen  table and said:    \"Grind herrings and broth, and grind them good and fast.\"    So the quern began to grind herrings and broth; first of all, all the  dishes full, then all the tubs full, and so on till the kitchen floor  was quite covered. Then the man twisted and twirled at the quern to get  it to stop, but for all his twisting and fingering the quern went on  grinding, and in a little while the broth rose so high that the man was  like to drown. So he threw open the kitchen door and ran into the  parlour, but it wasn't long before the quern had ground the parlour full  too, and it was only at the risk of his life that the man could get hold  of the latch of the house door through the stream of broth. When he got  the door open, he ran out and set off down the road, with the stream of  herrings and broth at his heels, roaring like a waterfall over the whole  farm.    Now, his old dame, who was in the field tossing hay, thought it a long  time to dinner, and at last she said:    \"Well! though the master doesn't call us home, we may as well go. Maybe  he finds it hard work to boil the broth, and will be glad of my help.\"    The men were willing enough, so they sauntered homeward; but just as  they had got a little way up the hill, what should they meet but  herrings, and broth, and bread, all running and dashing, and splashing  together in a stream, and the master himself running before them for his  life, and as he passed them he bawled out: \"Would to heaven each of you  had a hundred throats! but take care you're not drowned in the broth.\"    Away he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#3)"],[1,"it? And  how many buttons will you put on it? Sue's dress has twelve; I know, for  I counted them.\"    Mother did not answer all these questions; she just smiled as the  scissors went snip, snip into the cloth. But she did cut out ruffles,  and Aunt Maria began to hem them.    [Illustration: Mary with her mother and grandmother]    By and by grandmother came into the room.    \"Mary,\" she said, \"here is some lace I got in England. Mother may put it  on your dress.\"    How happy Mary was! She danced for joy.    Mother put on the lace, and grandmother worked the buttonholes. How many  do you suppose she worked? Why, she worked twelve!    When the dress was finished, it was just like Sue's. Only it was a great  deal finer, for Mary's dress had three ruffles and Sue's had only two!  And, then, there was the lace from England!          THE PLAID DRESS      \"I want a warm plaid dress,\" said a little girl. \"The days are colder,  and the frost will soon be here. But how can I get it? Mother says that  she cannot buy one for me.\"    The old white sheep in the meadow heard her, and he bleated to the  shepherd, \"The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. I will give my  wool. Who else will help?\"    The kind shepherd said, \"I will.\" Then he led the old white sheep to the  brook and washed its wool. When it was clean and white, he said, \"The  little girl wants a warm plaid dress. The sheep has given his wool, and  I have washed it clean and white. Who else will help?\"    \"We will,\" said the shearers. \"We will bring our shears and cut off the  wool.\"    The shearers cut the soft wool from the old sheep, and then they called,  \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The  shepherd has washed it; and we have sheared it. Who else will help?\"    [Illustration: Shearer shearing the sheep]    \"We will,\" cried the carders. \"We will comb it out straight and smooth.\"    Soon they held up the wool, carded straight and smooth, and they cried,  \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The  shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it, and we have  carded it. Who else will help?\"    \"We will,\" said the spinners. \"We will spin it into thread.\"    \"Whirr, whirr!\" How fast the spinning wheels turned, singing all the  time.    Soon the spinners said, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep  has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have  cut it. The carders have carded it, and we have spun it into thread. Who  else will help?\"    \"We will,\" said the dyers. \"We will dye it with beautiful colors.\"    Then they dipped the woven threads into bright dye, red and blue and  green and brown.    As they spread the wool out to dry, the dyers called: \"The little girl  wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed  the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it. The  spinners have spun it, and we have dyed it with bright beautiful colors.  Who else will help?\"    \"We will,\" said the weavers. \"We will make it into cloth.\"    [Illustration: Weaver at loom]    \"Clickety-clack! clickety-clack!\" went the loom, as the colored thread  was woven over and under over and under. Before long it was made into  beautiful plaid cloth.    Then the little girl's mother cut and made the dress. It was a beautiful  plaid dress, and the little girl loved to wear it. Every time she put it  on, she thought of her friends who had helped her,--the sheep, the  shearers, the carders, the spinners, the dyers, the weavers, and her own  dear mother.          THE GODDESS OF THE SILKWORM      Hoangti was the emperor of China. He had a beautiful wife whose name was  Si-ling. The emperor and his wife loved their people and always thought  of their happiness.    In those days the Chinese people wore clothes made of skins. By and by  animals grew scarce, and the people did not know what they should wear.  The emperor and empress tried in vain to find some other way of clothing  them.    One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful palace garden.  They walked up and down, up and down, talking of their people.    Suddenly the emperor said, \"Look at those worms on the mulberry trees,  Si-ling. They seem to be spinning.\"    Si-ling looked, and sure enough, the worms were spinning. A long thread  was coming from the mouth of each, and each little worm was winding this  thread around its body.    Si-ling and the emperor stood still and watched the worms. \"How  wonderful!\" said Si-ling.    The next morning Hoangti and the empress walked under the trees again.  They found some worms still winding thread. Others had already spun  their cocoons and were fast asleep. In a few days all of the worms had  spun cocoons.    \"This is indeed a wonderful, wonderful thing!\" said Si-ling. \"Why, each  worm has a thread on its body long enough to make a house for itself!\"    Si-ling thought of this day after day. One morning as she and the  emperor walked under the trees, she said, \"I believe I could find a way  to weave those long threads into cloth.\"    \"But how could you unwind the threads?\" asked the emperor.    [Illustration: Hoangti and Si-ling walking among the trees]    \"I'll find a way,\" Si-ling said. And she did; but she had to try many,  many times.    She put the cocoons in a hot place, and the little sleepers soon died.  Then the cocoons were thrown into boiling water to make the threads  soft. After that the long threads could be easily unwound.    Now Si-ling had to think of something else; she had to find a way to  weave the threads into cloth. After many trials, she made a loom--the  first that was ever made. She taught others to weave, and soon hundreds  of people were making cloth from the threads of the silkworm.    The people ever afterward called Si-ling \"The Goddess of the Silkworm.\"  And whenever the emperor walked with her in the garden, they liked to  watch the silkworms spinning threads for the good of their people.          THE FLAX    I      It was spring. The flax was in full bloom, and it had dainty little blue  flowers that nodded in the breeze.    \"People say that I look very well,\" said the flax. \"They say that I am  fine and long and that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How  happy I am! No one in the world can be happier.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said the fence post, \"you may grow and be happy, and you may  sing, but you do not know the world as I do. Why, I have knots in me.\"  And it creaked;      \"Snip, snap, snurre,    Basse, lurre,    The song is ended.\"    \"No, it is not ended,\" said the flax. \"The sun will shine, and the rain  will fall, and I shall grow and grow. No, no, the song is not ended.\"    One day some men came with sharp reap hooks. They took the flax by the  head and cut it off at the roots. This was very painful, you may be  sure.    Then the flax was laid in water and was nearly drowned. After that it  was put on a fire and nearly roasted. All this was frightful. But the  flax only said, \"One cannot be happy always. By having bad times as well  as good, we become wise.\"    After the flax had been cut and steeped and roasted, it was put on a  spinning wheel. \"Whir-r-r, whir-rr-r,\" went the spinning wheel; it went  so fast that the flax could hardly think.    \"I have been very happy in the sunshine and the rain,\" it said. \"If I am  in pain now, I must be contented.\"    At last the flax was put in the loom. Soon it became a beautiful piece  of white linen.    \"This is very wonderful,\" said the flax. \"How foolish the fence post was  with its song of--      'Snip, snap, snurre,    Basse, lurre,    The song is ended.'    The song is not ended, I am sure. It has only just begun.    \"After all that I have suffered, I am at last made into beautiful linen.  How strong and fine I am, and how long and white! This is even better  than being a plant bearing flowers. I have never been happier than I am  now.\"    After some time the linen was cut into pieces and sewed with needles.  That was not pleasant; but at last there were twelve pretty white  aprons.    \"See,\" said the flax, \"I have been made into something. Now I shall be  of some use in the world. That is the only way to be happy.\"      II      Years passed by, and the linen was so worn that it could hardly hold  together.    \"The end must come soon,\" said the flax.    At last the linen did fall into rags and tatters; it was torn into  shreds and boiled in water. The flax thought the end had come.    But no, the end was not yet. After being made into pulp and dried, the  flax became beautiful white paper.    \"This is a surprise, a glorious surprise,\" it said. \"I am finer than  ever, and I shall have fine things written on me. How happy I am!\"    And sure enough, the most beautiful stories and verses were written upon  it. People read the stories and verses, and they were made wiser and  better. Their children and their children's children read them, too, and  so the song was not ended.    --HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.    [Illustration: Girl reading a book]          THE WONDERFUL WORLD        Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful World,    With the wonderful water round you curled,    And the wonderful grass upon your breast,    World, you are beautifully drest.      The wonderful air is over me,    And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree--    It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,    And talks to itself on the top of the hills.      You friendly Earth, how far do you go,    With the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow,    With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,    And people upon you for thousands of miles?      Ah! you are so great, and I am so small,    I hardly can think of you, World, at all;    And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,    A whisper within me seemed to say,    \"You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot!    You can love and think, and the Earth cannot!\"    --William Brighty Rands.          [Illustration: The Hillman at"]]]
