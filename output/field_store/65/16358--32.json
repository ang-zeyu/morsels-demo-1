This means not merely that he  is a child of the earth, dust of her dust; but that the earth has  mothered him, fed him, set him tasks, directed his thoughts, confronted  him with difficulties that have strengthened his body and sharpened his  wits, given him his problems of navigation or irrigation, and at the  same time whispered hints for their solution. She has entered into his  bone and tissue, into his mind and soul. On the mountains she has given  him leg muscles of iron to climb the slope; along the coast she has left  these weak and flabby, but given him instead vigorous development of  chest and arm to handle his paddle or oar. In the river valley she  attaches him to the fertile soil, circumscribes his ideas and ambitions  by a dull round of calm, exacting duties, narrows his outlook to the  cramped horizon of his farm. Up on the wind-swept plateaus, in the  boundless stretch of the grasslands and the waterless tracts of the  desert, where he roams with his flocks from pasture to pasture and oasis  to oasis, where life knows much hardship but escapes the grind of  drudgery, where the watching of grazing herd gives him leisure for  contemplation, and the wide-ranging life a big horizon, his ideas take  on a certain gigantic simplicity; religion becomes monotheism, God  becomes one, unrivalled like the sand of the desert and the grass of the  steppe, stretching on and on without break or change. Chewing over and  over the cud of his simple belief as the one food of his unfed mind, his  faith becomes fanaticism; his big spacial ideas, born of that ceaseless  regular wandering, outgrow the land that bred them and bear their  legitimate fruit in wide imperial conquests.    Man can no more be scientifically studied apart from the ground which he  tills, or the lands over which he travels, or the seas over which he  trades, than polar bear or desert cactus can be understood apart from  its habitat. Man's relations to his environment are infinitely more  numerous and complex than those of the most highly organized plant or  animal. So complex are they that they constitute a legitimate and  necessary object of special study. The investigation which they receive  in anthropology, ethnology, sociology and history is piecemeal and  partial, limited as to the race, cultural development, epoch, country or  variety of geographic conditions taken into account.

He gave human  nature first place in his plan of dealing with human affairs. He did  not allow his mind to be disturbed by trifles. He had big jobs to  tackle, and he never doubted that he was the one and only man who  could carry them to a successful issue. He took his instructions from  Elizabeth and her blustering ministers, whom he regarded as just as  likely to serve Philip as the Tudor Queen if it came to a matter of  deciding between Popery and Protestantism. He received their  instructions in a courtly way, but there are striking evidences that  he was ever on the watch for their vacillating pranks, and he always  dashed out of port as soon as he had received the usual hesitating  permission. Once out of reach, he brushed aside imperial instructions  if they stood in the way of his own definite plan of serving the best  interests of his country, and if the course he took did not completely  succeed--which was seldom the case--he believed \"the reason was best  known to God.\"    John Hawkins and Francis Drake had a simple faith in the divine object  they were serving. Hawkins thought it an act of high godliness to  pretend that he had turned Papist, in order that he might revenge and  rescue the remnant of his poor comrades of the San Juan de Ulloa  catastrophe, who were now shut up in Seville yards and made to work in  chains. Sir John hoodwinked Philip by making use of Mr. George  Fitzwilliam, who in turn made use of Rudolfe and Mary Stuart. Mary  believed in the genuineness of the conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth  and set up the Queen of Scots in her place, to hand over Elizabeth's  ships to Spain, confiscate property, and to kill a number of  anti-Catholic people. The Hawkins counterplot of revenge on Philip and  his guilty confederates was completely successful. The comic audacity  of it is almost beyond belief. The Pope had bestowed his blessing on  the conspiracy, and the Spanish Council of State was enthusiastically  certain of its success. So credulous were they of the great piratical  seaman's conversion, that an agreement was signed pardoning Hawkins  for his acts of piracy in the West Indies and other places; a Spanish  peerage was given him together with L40,000, which was to be used for  equipping the privateer fleet. The money was duly paid in London, and  possibly some of it was used for repairing the British squadron which  Hawkins had pronounced as being composed of the finest ships in the  world for him to hand over to Philip, even though they had been  neglected owing to the Queen's meanness. The plausible way in which  the great seaman put this proposition caught the imagination of the  negotiators. They were captivated by him. He had caused them to  believe that he was a genuine seceder from heresy and from allegiance  to the Queen of England, and was anxious to avow his penitence for the  great sins he had committed against God and the only true faith, and  to make atonement for them in befitting humility. All he asked for was  forgiveness, and in the fullness of magnanimity they were possibly  moved to ask if, in addition to forgiveness, a Spanish peerage, and  L40,000, he would like to commemorate the occasion of his conversion  by a further token of His Spanish Majesty's favour. It is easy to  picture the apparent indifference with which he suggested that he did  not ask for favours, but if he were to ask for anything, it would be  the release from the Inquisition galleys of a few poor sailor  prisoners. The apparently modest request was granted. Hawkins had  risked his life to accomplish this, and now he writes a letter to  Cecil beginning \"My very good Lord.\" I do not give the whole of the  letter. Suffice it to say that he confirms the success of the plot so  far as he is concerned, and in a last paragraph he says, \"I have sent  your Lordship the copy of my pardon from the King of Spain, in the  order and manner I have it, with my great titles and honours from the  King, from which God deliver me.\"    The process by which Hawkins succeeded in obtaining the object he had  in view was the conception of no ordinary man. We talk and write of  his wonderful accomplishments on sea and land, as a skilful, brave  sailor, but he was more than that. He was, in many respects, a genius,  and his courage and resolution were unfailingly magnificent.    I dare say the prank he played on Philip and his advisers would be  regarded as unworthy cunning, and an outrage on the rules of high  honour. Good Protestant Christians disapproved then, as now, the  wickedness of thus gambling with religion to attain any object  whatsoever, and especially of swearing by the Mother of God the  renunciation of the Protestant faith and the adoption of Roman  Catholicism. The Spaniards, who had a hand in this nefarious  proceeding, were quite convinced that, though Hawkins had been a  pirate and a sea robber and murderer, now that he had come over to  their faith the predisposition to his former evil habits would leave  him. These were the high moral grounds on which was based the resolve  to execute Elizabeth and a large number of her subjects, and take  possession of the throne and private property at their will. It was,  of course, the spirit of retaliation for the iniquities of the British  rovers which was condoned by their monarch. In justification of our  part of the game during this period of warfare for religious and  material ascendancy, we stand by the eternal platitude that in that  age we were compelled to act differently from what we should be  justified in doing now. Civilization, for instance, so the argument  goes, was at a low ebb then. I am not so sure that it did not stand  higher than it does now. It is so easy for nations to become  uncivilized, and we, in common with other nations, have a singular  aptitude for it when we think we have a grievance. Be that as it may,  Hawkins, Drake, and the other fine sea rovers had no petty scruples  about relieving Spaniards of their treasure when they came across it  on land or on their ships at sea. Call them by what epithet you like,  they believed in the sanctity of their methods of carrying on war, and  the results for the most part confirmed the accuracy of their  judgment. At any rate, by their bold and resolute deeds they  established British freedom and her supremacy of the seas, and handed  down to us an abiding spirit that has reared the finest seamen and  established our incomparable merchant fleet, the largest and finest in  the world.    There is no shame in wishing the nation to become imbued with the  spirit of these old-time heroes, for the heritage they have bequeathed  to us is divine and lives on. We speak of the great deeds they were  guided to perform, but we rarely stop to think from whence the  inspiration came, until we are touched by a throbbing impulse that  brings us into the presence of the great mystery, at which who would  dare to mock?    It is strange that Hawkins' and Drake's brilliant and tragic careers  should have been brought to an end by the same disease within a short  time of each other and not many miles apart, and that their mother,  the sea, should have claimed them at last in the vicinity of the scene  of their first victorious encounter with their lifelong enemies, the  Spaniards. The death of the two invincibles, who had long struck  terror into the hearts of their foes, was the signal for prolonged  rejoicings in the Spanish Main and the Indies, while the British  squadron, battered and disease-smitten, made its melancholy way  homeward with the news of the tragedy.    For a time the loss of these commanding figures dealt a blow at the  national spirit. There are usually long intervals between Caesars and  Napoleons. Nations have, in obedience to some law of Nature, to pass  through periods of mediocre rule, and when men of great genius and  dominating qualities come to clear up the mess, they are only  tolerated possibly by fear, and never for long by appreciation. A  capricious public soon tires of these living heroes. It is after they  are dead that they become abiding examples of human greatness, not so  much to their contemporaries as to those generations that follow them.  The historian has a great deal to do with the manner in which the fame  of a great man is handed down to posterity, and it should never be  forgotten that historians have to depend on evidence which may be  faulty, while their own judgment may not always be sound. It is a most  difficult task to discipline the mind into a perfectly unbiased  condition. The great point is to state honestly what you believe, and  not what you may know those you are speaking to wish you to say. The  contemporaries of Hawkins and Drake unquestionably regarded them with  high admiration, but I question whether they were deified then as they  are now. The same thing applies to Nelson and Collingwood, of whom I  shall speak later on, as the historian has put the stamp upon their  great deeds also.    Drake and Hawkins attracted attention because of their daring voyages  and piratical enterprises on Spanish property on sea and land. Every  obstacle was brushed aside. Danger ever appealed to them. They dashed  into fortified ports filled with warships fully equipped, silenced the  forts, sank and set fire to Philip's vessels, and made everything and  everybody fly before them in the belief that hell had been let loose.  To the superstitious Spanish mind it seemed as though the English must  be under Satanic protection when they slashed their way undaunted into  the midst of dangers which would inevitably spell death for the mere  mortal. These corsairs of ours obviously knew and took advantage of  this superstition, for cannon were never resorted to without good  reason, and never without effect. The deliberate defiance of any  written or unwritten law that forbade their laying hands on the"]]]
