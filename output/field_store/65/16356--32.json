The extreme  importance to Spain of the fact of their being Christians at all will be  readily apprehended by contrasting the fate of the Spanish provincials  with that which befell the Christian and Romanized Britons at the hands  of our own Saxon forefathers only half-a-century later.    Meanwhile the Church in Spain, like the Church elsewhere, freed from the  quickening and purifying influences of persecution, had lost much of its  ancient fervour. Gladiatorial shows and lascivious dances on the stage  began to be tolerated even by Christians, though they were denounced by  the more devout as incompatible with the profession of the Christian  faith.    Spain also furnishes us with the first melancholy spectacle of Christian  blood shed by Christian hands. Priscillian, bishop of Avila, was led  into error by his intercourse with an Egyptian gnostic. What his error  exactly was is not very clear, but it seems to have comprised some of  the erroneous doctrines attributed to Manes and Sabellius. In 380, the  new heresy, with which two other bishops besides Priscillian became  infected, was condemned at a council held at Saragoza, and by another  held five years later at Bordeaux. Priscillian himself and six other  persons were executed with tortures at the instigation of Ithacius,[1]  bishop of Sossuba, and Idacius, bishop of Merida, in spite of the  protests of Martin of Tours and others. The heresy itself, however, was  not thus stamped out, and continued in Spain until long after the Gothic  conquest.    There is some reason for supposing that at the time of the Gothic  invasion Spain was still in great part Pagan, and that it continued to  be so during the whole period of Gothic domination.[2] Some Pagans  undoubtedly lingered on even as late as the end of the sixth century,[3]  but that there were any large numbers of them as late as the eighth  century is improbable.    Dr Dunham, who has given a clear and concise account of the Gothic  government in Spain, calls it the \"most accursed that ever existed in  Europe.\"[4] This is too sweeping a statement, though it must be allowed  that the haughty exclusiveness of the Gothic nobles rendered their yoke  peculiarly galling, while the position of their slaves was wretched  beyond all example. However, it is not to their civil administration  that we wish now to draw attention, but rather to the relations of  Church and State under a Gothic administration which was at first Arian  and subsequently orthodox.        [1] See Milman, \"Latin Christianity,\" vol. iii. p. 60.        [2] Dozy, ii. 44, quotes in support of this the second canon of      the Sixteenth Council of Toledo.        [3] Mason, a bishop of Merida, was said to have baptized a      Pagan as late as this.        [4] Dunham's \"Hist. of Spain,\" vol. i. p. 210.    The Government, which began with being of a thoroughly military  character, gradually tended to become a theocracy--a result due in great  measure to the institution of national councils, which were called by  the king, and attended by all the chief ecclesiastics of the realm. Many  of the nobles and high dignitaries of the State also took part in these  assemblies, though they might not vote on purely ecclesiastical matters.  These councils, of which there were nineteen in all (seventeen held at  Toledo, the Gothic capital, and two elsewhere), gradually assumed the  power of ratifying the election of the king, and of dictating his  religious policy. Thus by the Sixth Council of Toledo (canon three) it  was enacted that all kings should swear \"not to suffer the exercise of  any other religion than the Catholic, and to vigorously enforce the law  against all dissentients, especially against that accursed people the  Jews.\" The fact of the monarchy becoming elective[1] no doubt  contributed a good deal to throwing the power into the hands of the  clergy.    Dr Dunham remarks that these councils tended to make the bishops  subservient to the court, but surely the evidence points the other way.  On the whole it was the king that lost power, though no doubt as a  compensation he gained somewhat more authority over Church matters. He  could, for instance, issue temporary regulations with regard to Church  discipline. Witiza, one of the last of the Gothic kings, seems even to  have authorized, or at least encouraged, the marriage of his clergy.[2]  The king could preside in cases of appeal in purely ecclesiastical  affairs; and we know that Recared I. (587-601) and Sisebert (612-621)  did in fact exercise this right. He also gained the power of nominating  and translating bishops; but it is not clear when this privilege was  first conceded to the king.[3] The Fourth Council of Toledo (633)  enacted that a bishop should be elected by the clergy and people of his  city, and that his election should be approved by the metropolitan and  synod of his province: while the Twelfth Council, held forty-eight years  later, evidently recognizes the validity of their appointment by royal  warrant alone. Some have referred this innovation back to the despotic  rule of Theodoric the Ostrogoth, at the beginning of the sixth century;  others to the sudden accumulation of vacant sees on the fall of Arianism  in Spain. Another important power possessed by the kings was that of  convoking these national councils, and confirming their acts.        [1] In 531 A.D.        [2] Monk of Silo, sec. 14, who follows Sebastian of Salamanca;      Robertson, iii. 6. We learn from the \"Chron. Sil,\" sec. 27,      that Fruela (757-768) forbade the marriage of clergy. But these      accounts of Witiza's reign are all open to suspicion.        [3] Robertson, \"Hist. of Christian Church,\" vol. iii. p. 183.    The sudden surrender of their Arianism by the Gothic king and nobles is  a noticeable phenomenon. All the barbarian races that invaded Spain at  the beginning of the fifth century were inoculated with the Arian  heresy. Of these the Vandals carried their Arianism, which proved to be  of a very persecuting type, into Africa. The Suevi, into which nation  the Alani, under the pressure of a common enemy, had soon been absorbed,  gave up their Arianism for the orthodox faith about 560. The Visigoths,  however, remained Arians until a somewhat later period--until 589  namely, when Recared I., the son of Leovigild, held a national council  and solemnly abjured the creed of his forefathers, his example being  followed by many of his nobles and bishops.    The Visigoths, while they remained Arian, were on the whole remarkably  tolerant[1] towards both Jews and Catholics, though we have instances  to the contrary in the cases of Euric and Leovigild, who are said to  have persecuted the orthodox party. The latter king, indeed, who was  naturally of a mild and forgiving temper, was forced into harsh measures  by the unfilial and traitorous conduct of his son Ermenegild. If the  latter had been content to avow his conversion to orthodoxy without  entering into a treasonable rebellion in concert with the Suevi and  Imperialists against his too indulgent father, there is every reason to  think that Leovigild would have taken no measures against him. Even  after a second rebellion the king offered to spare his son's life--which  was forfeit to the State--on condition that he renounced his  newly-adopted creed, and returned to the Arian fold. His reason--a very  intelligible one--no doubt was that he might put an end to the risk of a  third rebellion by separating his son effectually from the intriguing  party of Catholics. To call Ermenegild a martyr because he was put to  death under such circumstances is surely an abuse of words.        [1] Lecky, \"Rise of Rationalism,\" vol. i. p. 14, note, says      that the Arian Goths were intolerant; but there seem to be      insufficient grounds for the assertion.    With the fall of Arianism came a large accession of bigotry to the  Spanish Church, as is sufficiently shewn by the canon above quoted from  the Sixth Council of Toledo. A subsequent law was even passed forbidding  anyone under pain of confiscation of his property and perpetual  imprisonment, to call in question the Holy Catholic and Apostolic  Church; the Evangelical Institutions; the definitions of the Fathers;  the decrees of the Church; and the Sacraments. In the spirit of these  enactments, severe measures were taken against the Jews, of whom there  were great numbers in Spain. Sisebert (612-621) seems to have been the  first systematic persecutor, whose zeal, as even Isidore confesses, was  \"not according to knowledge.\"[1] A cruel choice was given the Jews  between baptism on the one hand, and scourging and destitution on the  other. When this proved unavailing, more stringent edicts were enforced  against them. Those who under the pressure of persecution consented to  be baptised, were forced to swear by the most solemn of oaths that they  had in very truth renounced their Jewish faith and abhorred its rites.  Those who still refused to conform were subjected to every indignity and  outrage. They were obliged to have Christian servants, and to observe  Sunday and Easter. They were denied the _s connubii_ and the _ius  honorum_. Their testimony was invalid in law courts, unless a Christian  vouched for their character. Some who still held out were even driven  into exile. But this punishment could not have been systematically  carried out, for the Saracen invasion found great numbers of Jews still  in Spain. As Dozy[2] well says of the persecutors--\"On le voulut bien,  mais on ne le pouvait pas.\"        [1] Apud Florez, \"Esp.

In the long list of names who have suffered and died in the cause of  freedom, not one, perhaps, could be found whose efforts to redeem a poor  family of slaves were more Christlike than Seth Concklin's, whose noble  and daring spirit has been so long completely shrouded in mystery.  Except John Brown, it is a question, whether his rival could be found  with respect to boldness, disinterestedness and willingness to be  sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed.    By chance one day he came across a copy of the Pennsylvania Freeman,  containing the story of Peter Still, \"the Kidnapped and the  Ransomed,\"--how he had been torn away from his mother, when a little boy  six years old; how, for forty years and more, he had been compelled to  serve under the yoke, totally destitute as to any knowledge of his  parents' whereabouts; how the intense love of liberty and desire to get  back to his mother had unceasingly absorbed his mind through all these  years of bondage; how, amid the most appalling discouragements, prompted  alone by his undying determination to be free and be reunited with those  from whom he had been sold away, he contrived to buy himself; how, by  extreme economy, from doing over-work, he saved up five hundred dollars,  the amount of money required for his ransom, which, with his freedom,  he, from necessity, placed unreservedly in the confidential keeping of a  Jew, named Joseph Friedman, whom he had known for a long time and could  venture to trust,--how he had further toiled to save up money to defray  his expenses on an expedition in search of his mother and kindred; how,  when this end was accomplished, with an earnest purpose he took his  carpet-bag in his hand, and his heart throbbing for his old home and  people, he turned his mind very privately towards Philadelphia, where he  hoped, by having notices read in the colored churches to the effect that  \"forty-one or forty-two years before two little boys[A] were kidnapped  and carried South\"--that the memory of some of the older members might  recall the circumstances, and in this way he would be aided in his  ardent efforts to become restored to them.
