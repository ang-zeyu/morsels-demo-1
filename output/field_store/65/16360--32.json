She had been heard to pronounce them the most unruly class she  had ever attempted to instruct. Therefore her sympathies were with the  retreating sophomores, and with set lips and righteous indignation in her  eye, she resolved to lay the matter before Miss Thompson, at the earliest  opportunity.    Miss Thompson listened the next day with considerable surprise to Miss  Kane's account of the affair. No one knew the mischievous tendencies of  the juniors better than did the principal. Ordinary mischief she could  forgive, but this was overstepping all bounds. She had given the  sophomore class permission to use the gymnasium for the afternoon, and no  other class had the least right to take the matter over her head. She knew  that Professor Cole was entirely innocent of the deception practised upon  him, so she resolved to say nothing to him, but deal with the junior team  as she deemed best. One thing was certain, they should receive their just  deserts.    Miss Thompson's face, usually calm and serene, wore an expression of great  sternness as she faced the assembled classes in the study-hall the  following morning. The girls looked apprehensively at each other,  wondering what was about to happen. When their beloved principal looked  like that, there was trouble brewing for some one. Miss Thompson, though a  strict disciplinarian, was seldom angry. She was both patient and  reasonable in her dealings with the pupils under her supervision, and had  their utmost confidence and respect. To incur her displeasure one must  commit a serious offense. Each girl searched her mind for possible  delinquencies There was absolute silence in the great room. Then the  principal spoke:    \"I must ask the undivided attention of every girl in this room, as what I  am about to say relates in a measure to all of you.    \"There are four classes, representing four divisions of high school work,  assembled here this morning. Each one must be passed through before the  desired goal--graduation--is reached.    \"The standard of each class from freshmen to seniors, should be honor. I  have been very proud of my girls because I believed that they would be  able to live up to that standard. However it seems that some of them have  yet to learn the meaning of the word.\"    Miss Thompson paused. Nora cast a significant look toward Jessica, who sat  directly opposite her, while Julia Crosby fidgeted nervously in her seat,  and felt suddenly ill at ease.    \"Good-natured rivalry between classes,\" continued Miss Thompson, \"has  always been encouraged, but ill-natured trickery is to be deplored. A  matter has come to my ears which makes it necessary for me to put down  with an iron hand anything resembling such an evil.    \"You are all aware that I have been very willing to grant the use of the  gymnasium to the various teams for basketball practice, and have tried to  divide up the time as evenly as possible. Two days ago I gave the members  of the sophomore team permission to use the gymnasium for practice. No  other team had any right whatever to disturb them, yet I understand that  another team did commit that breach of class etiquette, drove the rightful  possessors from the room and occupied it for the remainder of the  afternoon. The report brought to me says that the young women of the  sophomore team conducted themselves with dignity during a most trying  situation.\"    Miss Thompson turned suddenly toward the junior section.    \"The members of the junior basketball team will please rise,\" she said  sternly.    There was a subdued murmur throughout the section, then one after another,  with the exception of Julia Crosby, the girls rose.    \"Miss Crosby,\" said the principal in a tone that brooked no delay, \"rise  at once! I expect instant obedience from every pupil in this school.\"    Julia sulkily rose to her feet.    \"Miss Crosby,\" continued Miss Thompson, \"are you not the captain of the  junior team?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Julia defiantly.    \"Did you go to Professor Cole for permission to use the gymnasium last  Thursday?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why did you not come to me?\"    Julia hung her head and made no reply.    \"I will tell you the reason, Miss Crosby,\" said the principal. \"You  already knew that permission had been granted the sophomore team, did you  not?\"    \"Yes,\" said Julia very faintly.    \"Very well. You are guilty of two serious misdemeanors. You purposely  misrepresented matters to Professor Cole and deliberately put aside my  authority; not to mention the unwomanly way in which you behaved toward  the sophomore team. Every girl who aided and abetted you in this is  equally guilty. Therefore you will all learn and recite to me an extra  page in history every day for two weeks. The use of the gymnasium will be  prohibited you for the same length of time, and if such a thing ever again  occurs, the culprits will be suspended without delay. You may be seated.\"    The dazed juniors sank limply into their seats. The tables had been turned  upon them with a vengeance. A page of history a day was bad enough, but  the loss of the gymnasium privilege was worse. The opening game was only  two weeks off, and they needed practice.    Julia Crosby put her head down on her desk and wept tears of rage and  mortification. The rest of the girls looked ready to cry, too.    The first bell for classes sounded and the girls picked up their books. At  the second bell they filed out through the corridor to their various  recitation rooms. As Grace, who had stopped to look for a lost pencil,  hurried toward the geometry classroom, she passed Julia Crosby, who was  moping along, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief. Julia cast an angry  glance at Grace, and hissed, \"tale-bearer.\"    Grace, inwardly smarting at the unjust accusation walked on without  answering.    \"What did I tell you about the way of the transgressor?\" said Anne to  Grace, as they walked home from school that day.    \"It certainly is hard enough this time,\" said Grace. \"But,\" she added, as  she thought of Julia Crosby's recent accusation, \"the way of the righteous  isn't always easy.\"          CHAPTER III    A GENEROUS APPEAL      The juniors themselves hardly felt the weight of their punishment more  than did Grace Harlowe. Her heart was set on winning every basketball game  of the series. But she wished to win fairly and honestly. Now, that the  juniors had been forbidden the use of the gymnasium, the sophomores might  practise there to their heart's content. But was that fair? To be sure the  juniors had deserved their punishment, but what kind of basketball could  they play after having had no practice for two weeks? Besides, Julia  Crosby blamed her for telling what had occurred in the gymnasium. She had  gone to Julia, earnestly avowing innocence, but Julia had only laughed at  her and refused to listen.    All this passed rapidly through Grace's mind as she walked toward the High  School several mornings later. Something must be done, but what she hardly  knew. The game could be postponed, but Grace felt that the other girls  would not care to postpone it. They were heartily glad that the junior  team had come to grief, and showed no sympathy for them.    \"There's just one thing to be done,\" sighed Grace to herself. \"And that's  to go to Miss Thompson and ask her to restore the juniors their privilege.  I hate to do it, she was so angry with them. But I'll do what I can,  anyway. Here goes.\"    Miss Thompson was in her office when Grace entered rather timidly, seating  herself on the oak settee until the principal should find time to talk to  talk with her.    \"Well, Grace, what can I do for you?\" said Miss Thompson, looking up  smilingly at the young girl. \"You look as though you carried the cares of  the world upon your shoulders this morning.\"    \"Not quite all of them, but I have a few especial ones that are bothering  me,\" replied Grace. Then after a moment's hesitation she said, \"Miss  Thompson, won't you, please, restore the juniors their gymnasium  privilege?\"    Miss Thompson regarded Grace searchingly. \"What a peculiar request to  make, Grace. Don't you consider the juniors' punishment a just one?\"    \"Yes,\" said Grace earnestly, \"I do. But this is the whole trouble. The  first basketball game between the juniors and the sophomores is scheduled  to take place in less than two weeks. If the juniors do not practise they  will play badly, and we shall beat them. We hope to win, at any rate, but  we want to feel that they have had the same chances that we have had. If  they do fail, they will say that it was because they had no opportunity  for practice. That will take all the sweetness out of the victory for us.\"    \"I think I see,\" said Miss Thompson, smiling a little. \"It is a case of  the innocent suffering with the guilty, isn't it? Personally, I hardly  feel like restoring these bad children to favor, as they sadly needed a  lesson; but since you take the matter so seriously to heart; I suppose I  must say 'yes.'\"    \"Thank you so much, dear Miss Thompson,\" said Grace with shining eyes,  \"and now I want to ask one more favor. Julia Crosby believes that I  reported her to you that day. Of course you know that I did not. Will you  please tell her so? Her accusation has made me very unhappy.\"    Miss Thompson looked a trifle stern. \"Yes, Grace,\" she said, \"I will  attend to that, too.\"    Grace turned to go, but Miss Thompson said. \"Wait a moment, Grace, I will  send for Miss Crosby.\"    Julia Crosby heard the summons with dismay. She wondered what Miss  Thompson could have to say to her. The principal's reprimand had been so  severe that even mischievous Julia felt obliged to go softly. Another  performance like the last might cut short her High School career. So she  let the sophomores severely alone. She was, therefore, surprised on  entering the office"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#3)"],[1,"thermore, the policy of reticence which has  prevailed in the past, while it has led to the omission of proper  instruction of the young, either by their parents or as part of our  system of education, has not prevented the dissemination of an  incomplete or perverted knowledge of the facts relating to sex, which,  being derived as a rule from tainted sources of information, has been  productive of a great deal of evil.    In these circumstances the Committee feel it their duty, before making  known their recommendations, to state in as plain terms as possible the  medical aspects of the problem they have had to consider.    There are three forms of venereal diseases namely, syphilis, gonorrhoea,  and chancroid--and of these the first two are the common and most  serious diseases. That sporadic syphilis existed in antiquity and even  in prehistoric times is probable, but there is no doubt that the disease  was a malignant European pandemic in the closing years of the fifteenth  century. The first reference to its origin is in a work written about  the year 1510, wherein it is described as a new affection in Barcelona,  unheard of until brought from Hayti by the sailors of Columbus in 1493.  The army of Charles VIII carried the scourge through Italy, and soon  Europe was aflame. \"Its enormous prevalence in modern times,\" says Dr.  Creighton, \"dates, without doubt, from the European libertinism of the  latter part of the fifteenth century.\" Gonorrhoea also has its origin in  the shades of antiquity, but that it became common in Europe about 1520  is a fact based on the highest authority.    Syphilization follows civilization, and syphilis is an important factor  in the extermination of aboriginal races. Syphilis was introduced into  Uganda when that country was opened to trade with the coast, and Colonel  Lambkin reported that \"In some districts 90 per cent. suffer from it....  Owing to the presence of syphilis the entire population stands a good  chance of being exterminated in a very few years, or left a degenerate  race fit for nothing.\" The earliest known account of the introduction of  syphilis into the Maori race is in an old Maori song composed in the far  North. The Maori population in a village on the shores of Tom Bowline's  Bay was employed in a whaling-station on the Three Kings Islands, and  there they became infected and carried the disease to the mainland.  Venereal disease is not common now among the Maoris, but it made great  ravages in the early days of colonization, to which may be attributed  much of the sterility and repeated miscarriages in the transitional  period of Maori history.    Through the ages great confusion existed as to the origin and nature of  venereal disease, but in 1905 a micro-organism, the _Spironema  pallidum_, was demonstrated as the infective agent in syphilis, and the  gonococcus as the infecting organism of gonorrhoea had been discovered in  1879. As regards modes of infection, syphilis is contracted usually by  sexual congress; occasionally the mode of infection is accidental and  innocent, and congenital transmission is not uncommon. Gonorrhoea is  contracted by sexual congress as a rule, but occasionally from innocent  contact with discharges, as in lavatories.    Syphilis, therefore, is a markedly contagious and inoculable disease. It  gains entrance, and usually in three weeks (although this period may be  much shorter) a slight sore appears at the site of infection. It may be  so slight as to pass unnoticed. This is the primary stage of syphilis.  Later, often after two months, the secondary stage begins, and if not  properly treated may last for two years. The patient is not too ill  usually to attend to his avocation, and has severe headache, skin  rashes, loss of hair, inflammation of the eyes, or other varied  symptoms. The tertiary stage may be early or delayed, and its effects  are serious. Masses of cells of low vitality, known as \"gummata,\" with a  tendency to break down or ulcerate, may form in almost any part of the  body, and the damage that occurs is considerable indeed. Various  diseases result which the lay mind would not associate with syphilis,  but it would be difficult to overestimate the resultant diseases that  may occur in any organ of the body:--        This racks the joints; this fires the veins:      That every labouring sinew strains;      Those in the deeper vitals rage.      Many deaths ascribed to other causes are the direct consequence of  syphilis. It cuts off life at its source, being a frequent cause of  abortion and early death of infants. It slays those who otherwise would  be strong and vigorous, sometimes striking down with palsy men in their  prime, or extinguishing the light of reason. It is an important factor  in the production of blindness, deafness, throat affections,  heart-disease and degeneration of the arteries, stomach and bowel  disease, kidney-disease, and affections of the bones. Congenital  syphilis often leads to epilepsy or to idiocy, and most of the victims  who survive are a charge on the State. This indictment against syphilis  is by no means complete. The economic loss resulting from this disease  is enormous as regards young, old, middle-aged. It respects not sex,  social rank, or years.    Gonorrhoea is characterized in its commonest form by a discharge of pus  from the urethra, and causes acute pain at its onset in the male, but in  the female it commonly causes little or no discomfort. Unless carefully  treated, and treated early, it gives rise to many complications, such as  inflammation of the bladder, gleet, stricture, inflammation of joints,  abscesses, and rheumatism. It is a common cause of sterility and of  miscarriages, and, in the female, of many internal inflammations and  disablement, and in its later effects requires often surgical operations  on women. It is a very common disease, and the public know little of the  evil consequences which may follow what they have persisted in regarding  as a simple complaint. From its prevalence and its complications it is  one of the most serious diseases that affect mankind.    As regards treatment of venereal disease of all kinds, it should be  clearly understood that the causative germs are well known and can  readily be destroyed immediately after exposure to infection by thorough  cleansing with antiseptic lotion or ointment. The use of soap and water  only would lessen the incidence of infection. On the first suspicious  sign of venereal disease the patient should apply at once for medical  advice. There are methods of diagnosis, such as microscopic examination  and the Wassermann test, the result of recent discovery, which make  diagnosis simple and certain; and if treatment is begun early according  to modern methods, which are much more effective than the remedies  formerly applied, the germs of infection are easily vanquished. When  sufficient time, however, is lost to enable these germs to become  entrenched in parts of the body not readily accessible to treatment,  cure is difficult, prolonged, and perhaps in some cases uncertain.    For their own sakes, as well as for the sake of others, patients  suffering from any form of venereal disease should continue treatment,  which may be prolonged in the case of syphilis for two years, until  their medical adviser is satisfied that further treatment is  unnecessary.    Women suffer less pain than men in these diseases, and consequently are  more apt to neglect securing medical advice and treatment, and more  ready to discontinue treatment before a cure is effected.      SECTION 3.--ACCIDENTAL INFECTION.    Occasionally cases are met with in which syphilis is acquired innocently  by direct or indirect contact with syphilitic material, and then the  primary sore is often located on some other part of the body than the  genitals. Thus the lip may be infected by kissing, or by drinking out of  the same glass, or smoking the same pipe as a syphilitic patient. A  medical witness reported a case to the Committee in which syphilis was  conveyed to two girls \"through a young fellow handing them a cigarette  which he was smoking.\" Metchnikoff has proved that the spironema of  syphilis is a delicate organism and quickly loses its virulence outside  the human body, and it cannot enter the system through unbroken skin or  mucous membrane. It is extremely doubtful if any form of venereal  infection can be conveyed in food. Frequently venereal disease is  deceitfully attributed by patients to innocent infection, and no doubt  some genuine cases do occur, but how seldom is illustrated by the  statement of the Officer in Charge of the V.D. Clinic at Christchurch,  who said, \"I cannot remember a case where I was absolutely certain that  infection was acquired innocently or extragenitally.\"    Gonorrhoea may be conveyed innocently from infective discharge on a  closet-seat, or from an infected towel, &c., and undoubtedly gonorrhoeal  discharge if brought into contact with the eye sets up a violent  suppuration.    The Committee are of opinion that the extent of accidental infection is  greatly exaggerated in the public mind, but a few cases occasionally  occur, and the Committee recommend that there should be better provision  of public conveniences, especially for women, and the U-shaped  closet-seat should be adopted. The use of common towels and  drinking-cups in railway-trains, schools, factories, and elsewhere is  condemned not only for the reasons stated above, but on general sanitary  grounds.      SECTION 4.--PREVIOUS INQUIRIES AND CONFERENCES.    After the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act in England in 1886,  various Committees and Royal Commissions, such as the Inter-departmental  Committee on Physical Deterioration in 1904, the Royal Commission on the  Poor-laws in 1909, and the Royal Commission on Divorce in 1912, drew  attention to the frightful havoc wrought by venereal disease, and urged  that"]]]
