HIS ARRIVAL AT THE CANARY ISLANDS.    The first land we saw after we were out of the Channel was Cape  Finisterre, which we made on the 19th; and on the 28th made Lancerota,  one of the Canary Islands of which, and of Allegrance, another of them, I  have here given the sights, as they both appeared to us at two several  bearings and distances.    SANTA CRUZ IN TENERIFE; THE ROAD AND TOWN, AND SPANISH WRECK.    We were now standing away for the island Tenerife where I intended to  take in some wine and brandy for my voyage. On Sunday, half an hour past  3 in the afternoon, we made the island and crowded in with all our sails  till five; when the north-east point of the isle bore west-south-west  distance 7 leagues. But, being then so far off that I could not expect to  get in before night, I lay by till next morning, deliberating whether I  should put in at Santa Cruz, or at Oratavia, the one on the east, the  other on the west side of the island; which lies mostly north and south;  and these are the principal ports on each side. I chose Santa Cruz as the  better harbour (especially at this time of the year) and as best  furnished with that sort of wine which I had occasion to take in for my  voyage: so there I come to an anchor January 30th, in 33 fathom water,  black slimy ground; about half a mile from the shore; from which distance  I took the sight of the town.    In the road ships must ride in 30, 40, or 50 fathom water, not above half  a mile from the shore at farthest: and if there are many ships they must  ride close one by another. The shore is generally high land and in most  places steep too. This road lies so open to the east that winds from that  side make a great swell, and very bad going ashore in boats: the ships  that ride here are then often forced to put to sea, and sometimes to cut  or slip their anchors, not being able to weigh them. The best and  smoothest landing is in a small sandy cove, about a mile to the  north-east of the road, where there is good water, with which ships that  lade here are supplied; and many times ships that lade at Oratavia, which  is the chief port for trade, send their boats hither for water. That is a  worse port for westerly than this is for easterly winds; and then all  ships that are there put to sea. Between this watering-place and Santa  Cruz are two little forts; which with some batteries scattered along the  coast command the road. Santa Cruz itself is a small unwalled town  fronting the sea, guarded with two other forts to secure the road. There  are about 200 houses in the town, all two stories high, strongly built  with stone and covered with pantile. It hath two convents and one church,  which are the best buildings in the town. The forts here could not secure  the Spanish galleons from Admiral Blake, though they hauled in close  under the main fort. Many of the inhabitants that are now living remember  that action in which the English battered the town, and did it much  damage; and the marks of the shot still remain in the fort walls. The  wrecks of the galleons that were burnt here lie in 15 fathom water: and  it is said that most of the plate lies there, though some of it was  hastily carried ashore at Blake's coming in sight.    LAGUNA TOWN LAKE AND COUNTRY; AND ORATAVIA TOWN AND ROAD.    Soon after I had anchored I went ashore here to the Governor of the town,  who received me very kindly and invited me to dine with him the next day.  I returned on board in the evening, and went ashore again with two of my  officers the next morning; hoping to get up the hill time enough to see  Laguna, the principal town, and to be back again to dine with the  Governor of Santa Cruz; for I was told that Laguna was but 3 miles off.  The road is all the way up a pretty steep hill; yet not so steep but that  carts go up and down laden. There are public houses scattering by the  wayside, where we got some wine. The land on each side seemed to be but  rocky and dry; yet in many places we saw spots of green flourishing corn.  At farther distances there were small vineyards by the sides of the  mountains, intermixed with abundance of waste rocky land, unfit for  cultivation, which afforded only dildo-bushes. It was about 7 or 8 in the  morning when we set out from Santa Cruz; and, it being fair clear  weather, the sun shone very bright and warmed us sufficiently before we  got to the city Laguna; which we reached about 10 o'clock, all sweaty and  tired, and were glad to refresh ourselves with a little wine in a sorry  tippling-house: but we soon found out one of the English merchants that  resided here, who entertained us handsomely at dinner, and in the  afternoon showed us the town.    Laguna is a pretty large well-compacted town, and makes a very agreeable  prospect. It stands part of it against a hill, and part in a level. The  houses have mostly strong walls built with stone and covered with  pantile. They are not uniform, yet they appear pleasant enough. There are  many fair buildings; among which are 2 parish churches, 2 nunneries, a  hospital, 4 convents, and some chapels; besides many gentlemen's houses.  The convents are those of St. Austin, St. Dominick, St. Francis, and St.  Diego. The two churches have pretty high square steeples, which top the  rest of the buildings. The streets are not regular, yet they are mostly  spacious and pretty handsome; and near the middle of the town is a large  parade, which has good buildings about it. There is a strong prison on  one side of it; near which is a large conduit of good water, that  supplies all the town. They have many gardens which are set round with  oranges, limes, and other fruits: in the middle of which are pot-herbs,  salading, flowers, etc. And indeed, if the inhabitants were curious this  way, they might have very pleasant gardens: for as the town stands high  from the sea on the brow of a plain that is all open to the east, and  hath consequently the benefit of the true tradewind, which blows here and  is most commonly fair; so there are seldom wanting at this town brisk,  cooling, and refreshing breezes all the day.    On the back of the town there is a large plain of 3 or 4 leagues in  length and 2 miles wide, producing a thick kindly sort of grass, which  looked green and very pleasant when I was there, like our meadows in  England in the spring. On the east side of this plain, very near the back  of the town, there is a natural lake or pond of fresh water. It is about  half a mile in circumference; but being stagnant, it is only used for  cattle to drink of. In the wintertime several sorts of wildfowl resort  hither, affording plenty of game to the inhabitants of Laguna. This city  is called Laguna from hence; for that word in Spanish signifies a lake or  pond. The plain is bounded on the west, the north-west and the south-west  with high steep hills; as high above this plain as this is above the sea;  and it is from the foot of one of these mountains that the water of the  conduit which supplies the town is conveyed over the plain in troughs of  stone raised upon pillars. And indeed, considering the situation of the  town, its large prospect to the east (for from hence you see the Grand  Canary) its gardens, cool arbors, pleasant plain, green fields, the pond  and aqueduct, and its refreshing breezes; it is a very delightful  dwelling, especially for such as have not business that calls them far  and often from home: for, the island being generally mountainous, steep,  and craggy, full of risings and fallings, it is very troublesome  travelling up and down in it, unless in the cool of the mornings and  evenings: and mules and asses are most used by them, both for riding and  carriage, as fittest for the stony, uneven roads.    Beyond the mountains, on the south-west side, still further up, you may  see from the town and plain a small peaked hill, overlooking the rest.  This is that which is called the Pike of Tenerife, so much noted for its  height: but we saw it here at so great a disadvantage, by reason of the  nearness of the adjacent mountains to us, that it looked inconsiderable  in respect to its fame.    OF THE WINES AND OTHER COMMODITIES OF TENERIFE, ETC.    The true malmsey wine grows in this island; and this here is said to be  the best of its kind in the world. Here is also canary wine, and verdona,  or green wine. The canary grows chiefly on the west side of the island;  and therefore is commonly sent to Oratavia; which being the chief seaport  for trade in the island, the principal English merchants reside there,  with their consul; because we have a great trade for this wine. I was  told that that town is bigger than Laguna; that it has but one church,  but many convents: that the port is but ordinary at best and is very bad  when the north-west winds blow. These norwesters give notice of their  coming by a great sea that tumbles in on the shore for some time before  they come, and by a black sky in the north-west. Upon these signs ships  either get up their anchors, or slip their cables and put to sea, and ply  off and on till the weather is over. Sometimes they are forced to do so 2  or 3 times before they can take in their lading; which it is hard to do  here in the fairest weather: and for fresh water they send, as I have  said, to Santa Cruz. Verdona is green, strong-bodied wine, harsher and  sharper than canary. It is not so much esteemed in Europe, but is  exported to the West Indies, and will keep best in hot countries; for  which reason I touched here to take in some of it for my voyage. This  sort of wine is made chiefly on the east side of the island, and shipped  off at Santa Cruz.    Besides these wines, which are yearly vended in great plenty from the  Canary Islands (chiefly from Grand Canary, Tenerife,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#3)"],[1,"to arise from bed.    Meantime, her husband had pitched upon a spot for their new home. He  returned from Boston to Salem, travelling through the woods on foot, and  leaning on his pilgrim's staff. His heart yearned within him; for he was  eager to tell his wife of the new home which he had chosen. But when he  beheld her pale and hollow cheek, and found how her strength was wasted,  he must have known that her appointed home was in a better land. Happy for  him then,--happy both for him and her,--if they remembered that there was a  path to heaven, as well from this heathen wilderness as from the Christian  land whence they had come. And so, in one short month from her arrival,  the gentle Lady Arbella faded away and died. They dug a grave for her in  the new soil, where the roots of the pine trees impeded their spades; and  when her bones had rested there nearly two hundred years, and a city had  sprung up around them, a church of stone was built upon the spot.        Charley, almost at the commencement of the foregoing narrative, had  galloped away with a prodigious clatter, upon Grandfather's stick, and was  not yet returned. So large a boy should have been ashamed to ride upon a  stick. But Laurence and Clara had listened attentively, and were affected  by this true story of the gentle lady, who had come so far to die so soon.  Grandfather had supposed that little Alice was asleep, but, towards the  close of the story, happening to look down upon her, he saw that her blue  eyes were wide open, and fixed earnestly upon his face. The tears had  gathered in them, like dew upon a delicate flower; but when Grandfather  ceased to speak, the sunshine of her smile broke forth again.    \"O, the lady must have been so glad to get to heaven!\" exclaimed little  Alice.    \"Grandfather, what became of Mr. Johnson?\" asked Clara.    \"His heart appears to have been quite broken,\" answered Grandfather; \"for  he died at Boston within a month after the death of his wife. He was  buried in the very same tract of ground, where he had intended to build a  dwelling for Lady Arbella and himself. Where their house would have stood  there was his grave.    \"I never heard any thing so melancholy!\" said Clara.    \"The people loved and respected Mr. Johnson so much,\" continued  Grandfather, \"that it was the last request of many of them, when they  died, that they might be buried as near as possible to this good man's  grave. And so the field became the first burial-ground in Boston. When you  pass through Tremont street, along by King's Chapel, you see a  burial-ground, containing many old grave-stones and monuments. That was  Mr. Johnson's field.\"    \"How sad is the thought,\" observed Clara, \"that one of the first things  which the settlers had to do, when they came to the new world, was to set  apart a burial-ground!\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Laurence, \"if they had found no need of burial-grounds  here, they would have been glad, after a few years, to go back to  England.\"    Grandfather looked at Laurence, to discover whether he knew how profound  and true a thing he had said.          Chapter III      Not long after Grandfather had told the story of his great chair, there  chanced to be a rainy day. Our friend Charley, after disturbing the  household with beat of drum and riotous shouts, races up and down the  staircase, overturning of chairs, and much other uproar, began to feel the  quiet and confinement within doors intolerable. But as the rain came down  in a flood, the little fellow was hopelessly a prisoner, and now stood  with sullen aspect at a window, wondering whether the sun itself were not  extinguished by so much moisture in the sky.    Charley had already exhausted the less eager activity of the other  children; and they had betaken themselves to occupations that did not  admit of his companionship. Laurence sat in a recess near the book-case,  reading, not for the first time, the Midsummer Night's Dream. Clara was  making a rosary of beads for a little figure of a Sister of Charity, who  was to attend the Bunker Hill Fair, and lend her aid in erecting the  Monument. Little Alice sat on Grandfather's foot-stool, with a  picture-book in her hand; and, for every picture, the child was telling  Grandfather a story. She did not read from the book, (for little Alice had  not much skill in reading,) but told the story out of her own heart and  mind.    Charley was too big a boy, of course, to care any thing about little  Alice's stories, although Grandfather appeared to listen with a good deal  of interest. Often, in a young child's ideas and fancies, there is  something which it requires the thought of a lifetime to comprehend. But  Charley was of opinion, that if a story must be told, it had better be  told by Grandfather, than little Alice.    \"Grandfather, I want to hear more about your chair,\" said he.    Now Grandfather remembered that Charley had galloped away upon a stick, in  the midst of the narrative of poor Lady Arbella, and I know not whether he  would have thought it worth while to tell another story, merely to gratify  such an inattentive auditor as Charley. But Laurence laid down his book  and seconded the request. Clara drew her chair nearer to Grandfather, and  little Alice immediately closed her picture-book, and looked up into his  face. Grandfather had not the heart to disappoint them.    He mentioned several persons who had a share in the settlement of our  country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find  room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the  famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the  inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was  chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children  what became of this upright and zealous man, at last. In fact, his  auditors were growing impatient to hear more about the history of the  chair.    \"After the death of Mr. Johnson,\" said he, \"Grandfather's chair came into  the possession of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at  Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a  studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon, or reading some  abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that  period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read  or work by the light of pitchpine torches. These supplied the place of the  \"midnight oil,\" to the learned men of New England.\"    Grandfather went on to talk about Roger Williams, and told the children  several particulars, which we have not room to repeat. One incident,  however, which was connected with his life, must be related, because it  will give the reader an idea of the opinions and feelings of the first  settlers of New England. It was as follows:        THE RED CROSS      While Roger Williams sat in Grandfather's chair, at his humble residence  in Salem, John Endicott would often come to visit him. As the clergy had  great influence in temporal concerns, the minister and magistrate would  talk over the occurrences of the day, and consult how the people might be  governed according to scriptural laws.    One thing especially troubled them both. In the old national banner of  England, under which her soldiers have fought for hundreds of years, there  is a Red Cross, which has been there ever since the days when England was  in subjection to the Pope. The Cross, though a holy symbol, was abhorred  by the Puritans, because they considered it a relic of Popish idolatry.  Now, whenever the train-band of Salem was mustered, the soldiers, with  Endicott at their head, had no other flag to march under than this same  old papistical banner of England, with the Red Cross in the midst of it.  The banner of the Red Cross, likewise, was flying on the walls of the fort  of Salem; and a similar one was displayed in Boston harbor, from the  fortress on Castle Island.    \"I profess, brother Williams,\" Captain Endicott would say, after they had  been talking of this matter, \"it distresses a Christian man's heart, to  see this idolatrous Cross flying over our heads. A stranger beholding it,  would think that we had undergone all our hardships and dangers, by sea  and in the wilderness, only to get new dominions for the Pope of Rome.\"    \"Truly, good Mr. Endicott,\" Roger Williams would answer, \"you speak as an  honest man and Protestant Christian should. For mine own part, were it my  business to draw a sword, I should reckon it sinful to fight under such a  banner. Neither can I, in my pulpit, ask the blessing of Heaven upon it.\"    Such, probably, was the way in which Roger Williams and John Endicott used  to talk about the banner of the Red Cross. Endicott, who was a prompt and  resolute man, soon determined that Massachusetts, if she could not have a  banner of her own, should at least be delivered from that of the Pope of  Rome.    Not long afterwards there was a military muster at Salem. Every  able-bodied man, in the town and neighborhood, was there. All were well  armed, with steel caps upon their heads, plates of iron upon their breasts  and at their backs, and gorgets of steel around their necks. When the sun  shone upon these ranks of iron-clad men, they flashed and blazed with a  splendor that bedazzled the wild Indians, who had come out of the woods to  gaze at them. The soldiers had long pikes, swords, and muskets, which were  fired with matches, and were almost as heavy as a small cannon.    These men had mostly a stern and rigid aspect. To judge by their looks,  you might have supposed that there was as much iron in their hearts, as  there was upon their heads and breasts. They were all devoted Puritans,  and of the same temper as those with whom Oliver Cromwell afterwards  overthrew the throne of England. They hated all the relics of Popish  superstition as much as Endicott himself; and yet, over their"]]]
