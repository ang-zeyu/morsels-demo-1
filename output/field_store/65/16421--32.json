In some instances, where Indians had  found and were working good mining claims, they were forcibly  driven away by white miners, who took possession of their claims  and worked them.    Moreover, the Indians saw that their main sources of food supply  were being rapidly destroyed. The oak trees, which produced the  acorns--one of their staple articles of food,--were being cut  down and burned by miners and others in clearing up land for  cultivation, and the deer and other food game were being  rapidly killed off or driven from the locality.    [Illustration: _Copyrighted Photograph by Boysen_.  AN INDIAN DANCER.  Chow-chil-la Indian in full war-dance costume.]    In the \"early days,\" before California was admitted as a free  State into the Union, it was reported, and was probably true,  that some of the immigrants from the slave-holding States took  Indians and made slaves of them in working their mining claims.  It was no uncommon event for the sanctity of their homes and  families to be invaded by some of the \"baser sort,\" and young  women taken, willing or not, for servants and wives.      RETALIATION.    In retaliation, and as some compensation for these many grievous  outrages upon their natural inalienable rights of domain and  property, and their native customs, the Indians stole horses and  mules from the white settlers, and killed them for food for their  families, who, in many instances, were in a condition of  starvation.    Finally the chiefs and leading men of all the tribes involved met  in a grand council, and resolved to combine their warrior forces  in one great effort to drive all their white enemies from the  country, before they became more numerous and formidable.      BEGINNING OF HOSTILITIES.    To prepare for this struggle for existence, they made raids upon  some of the principal trading posts in the mining sections,  killed those in charge, took all the blankets, clothing and  provisions they could carry away, and fled to the mountains,  where they were soon pursued by the soldiers and volunteer  citizens, and a spirited battle was fought without any decisive  advantage to either side.    The breaking out of actual hostilities created great excitement  among the whites, and an urgent call was made upon the Governor  of the State for a military force to meet the emergency, and  protect the settlers--a force strong enough to thoroughly subdue  the Indians, and remove all of them to reservations to be  selected by the United States Indian Commissioners for that  purpose.    Meantime the Governor and the Commissioners, who had then  arrived, were receiving numerous communications, many of them  from persons in high official positions, earnestly urging a more  humane and just policy, averring that the Indians had real cause  for complaint, that they had been \"more sinned against than  sinning\" since the settling of California by the whites, and that  they were justly entitled to protection by the Government and  compensation for the spoliations and grievances they had  suffered.    These protests doubtless had some influence in delaying hostile  measures, and in the inauguration of efforts to induce the  Indians to come in and treat with the Commissioners, envoys being  sent out to assure them of fair treatment and personal safety.  Many of the Indians accepted these offers, and, as the different  tribes surrendered, they were taken to the two reservations which  the Commissioners had established for them on the Fresno River,  the principal one being a few miles above the place where the  town of Madera is now located.    As before stated, these Indians were not a warlike people. Their  only weapons were their bows and arrows, and these they soon  found nearly useless in defending themselves at long range  against soldiers armed with rifles. Moreover, their stock of  provisions was so limited that they either had to surrender or  starve.      DISCOVERY OF YOSEMITE VALLEY.    The Yosemites and one or two other bands of Indians had refused  to surrender, and had retreated to their mountain strongholds,  where they proposed to make a last determined resistance. Active  preparations were accordingly made by the State authorities to  follow them, and either capture or exterminate all the tribes  involved. For this purpose a body of State volunteers, known as  the Mariposa Battalion, was organized, under the command of Major  James D. Savage, to pursue these tribes into the mountains; and,  after many long marches and some fighting, the Indians were all  defeated, captured, and, with their women and children, put upon  the reservations under strong military guard.    It was during this campaign that Major Savage and his men  discovered the Yosemite Valley, about the 21st of March, 1851,  while in pursuit of the Yosemites, under old Chief Teneiya, for  whom Lake Teneiya and Teneiya Canyon have appropriately been  named.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Foley._  THREE BROTHERS (WAW-HAW'-KEE), 3,900 Feet.  Named by the soldiers who discovered the Valley, to commemorate  the capture of three sons of Teneiya near this place. The Indian  name means \"Falling Rocks.\"]          Chapter Two.    EFFECTS OF THE WAR.      The Yosemites and all of the other tribes named in the previous  chapter were put upon the Fresno reservation. Major Savage, who  had been the leading figure in the war against the Indians, was  perhaps their best friend while in captivity, and finally lost  his life in a personal quarrel, while resenting a wrong which had  been committed against them.    The tribes from south of the San Joaquin River, who were also  conquered in 1851, were put upon the Kings River and Tejon  (_Tay-hone'_) reservations.      LIFE ON THE RESERVATIONS.    Ample food supplies, blankets, clothing and cheap fancy articles  were furnished by the Government for the subsistence, comfort and  pleasure of the Indians on the reservations, and for a short time  they seemed to be contented, and to enjoy the novelty of their  new mode of life. The young, able-bodied men were put to work  assisting in clearing, fencing and cultivating fields for hay  and vegetables, and thus they were partially self-supporting. A  large portion of them, however, soon began to tire of the  restraints imposed, and longed for their former condition of  freedom, and many of them sickened and died.    Old Teneiya, chief of the \"Grizzlies,\" was particularly affected  by the change in his surroundings, and by the humiliation of  defeat. He suffered keenly from the hot weather of the plains,  after his free life in the mountains, and begged to be allowed to  return to his old home, promising not to disturb the white  settlers in any way, a pledge which he did not break.      DEATH OF TENEIYA.    Teneiya was finally allowed to depart, with his family, after  having been on the reservation only a few months, and some of his  old followers afterwards stole away and joined him. With this  remnant of his band he returned to the Yosemite, but not long  afterwards they were set upon by the Monos, a tribe from the  eastern side of the Sierras, with whom they had quarreled, and  the old chief and many of his warriors were killed. It was  perhaps fitting that he should meet his death in the valley which  he loved, and which he had so long defended against his enemies.      RESTORED TO LIBERTY.    In 1855, after four years of confinement on the reservations, an  agreement was made with the Indian Commissioners, by the head men  of the tribes, that if their people were again allowed their  freedom, they would forever remain in peace with the white  settlers, and try and support themselves free of expense to the  Government. They were soon permitted to leave, and have ever  since faithfully kept their promise.    Most of them went back to the vicinity of their old homes, and  made temporary settlements on unoccupied Government land, as many  of their old village sites were now in possession of white  settlers. As there was a very large crop of acorns that season,  they gathered an abundant supply for winter use, and, with what  was given to them in the way of food and clothing by some of the  white settlers, they managed to get through the winter fairly  well.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Foley_.  CAPTAIN PAUL.  One of the characters of the Valley. Supposed to be 105 years  old, and a survivor of Teneiya's band.]      HARDSHIP AND SUFFERING.    Their four years' residence on the reservations, however, had  been more of a school in the vices of the whites than one of a  higher education. They became demoralized socially, addicted to  many bad habits, and left the reservations in worse condition  than when they were taken there. Their old tribal relations and  customs were nearly broken up, though they still had their head  men to whom they looked for counsel in all important matters.    As the country became more settled, much of their main food  supply, the acorns, was consumed by the domestic animals of the  ranchers, and their mode of living became more precarious and  transitory, and many of them were, at times, in a condition near  to starvation. In these straitened and desperate circumstances,  many of their young women were used as commercial property, and  peddled out to the mining camps and gambling saloons for money to  buy food, clothing or whisky, this latter article being obtained  through the aid of some white person, in violation of law.    Their miserable, squalid condition of living opened the way for  diseases of a malignant character, which their medicine men could  not cure, and their numbers were rapidly reduced by death.    At the present time there are not in existence a half-dozen of  the old Yosemites who were living, even as children, when the  Valley was first discovered in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#3)"],[1,"dying. When this objection has been removed,  Socrates proceeds: This doctrine of the mutual exclusion of opposites  is not only true of the opposites themselves, but of things which are  inseparable from them. For example, cold and heat are opposed; and fire,  which is inseparable from heat, cannot co-exist with cold, or snow,  which is inseparable from cold, with heat. Again, the number three  excludes the number four, because three is an odd number and four is  an even number, and the odd is opposed to the even. Thus we are able to  proceed a step beyond 'the safe and simple answer.' We may say, not  only that the odd excludes the even, but that the number three, which  participates in oddness, excludes the even. And in like manner, not only  does life exclude death, but the soul, of which life is the inseparable  attribute, also excludes death. And that of which life is the  inseparable attribute is by the force of the terms imperishable. If the  odd principle were imperishable, then the number three would not perish  but remove, on the approach of the even principle. But the immortal is  imperishable; and therefore the soul on the approach of death does not  perish but removes.    Thus all objections appear to be finally silenced. And now the  application has to be made: If the soul is immortal, 'what manner of  persons ought we to be?' having regard not only to time but to eternity.  For death is not the end of all, and the wicked is not released from his  evil by death; but every one carries with him into the world below that  which he is or has become, and that only.    For after death the soul is carried away to judgment, and when she has  received her punishment returns to earth in the course of ages. The wise  soul is conscious of her situation, and follows the attendant angel who  guides her through the windings of the world below; but the impure soul  wanders hither and thither without companion or guide, and is carried  at last to her own place, as the pure soul is also carried away to hers.  'In order that you may understand this, I must first describe to you the  nature and conformation of the earth.'    Now the whole earth is a globe placed in the centre of the heavens, and  is maintained there by the perfection of balance. That which we call the  earth is only one of many small hollows, wherein collect the mists and  waters and the thick lower air; but the true earth is above, and is in  a finer and subtler element. And if, like birds, we could fly to the  surface of the air, in the same manner that fishes come to the top of  the sea, then we should behold the true earth and the true heaven and  the true stars. Our earth is everywhere corrupted and corroded; and even  the land which is fairer than the sea, for that is a mere chaos or waste  of water and mud and sand, has nothing to show in comparison of the  other world. But the heavenly earth is of divers colours, sparkling with  jewels brighter than gold and whiter than any snow, having flowers and  fruits innumerable. And the inhabitants dwell some on the shore of the  sea of air, others in 'islets of the blest,' and they hold converse  with the gods, and behold the sun, moon and stars as they truly are, and  their other blessedness is of a piece with this.    The hollows on the surface of the globe vary in size and shape from that  which we inhabit: but all are connected by passages and perforations in  the interior of the earth. And there is one huge chasm or opening called  Tartarus, into which streams of fire and water and liquid mud are ever  flowing; of these small portions find their way to the surface and  form seas and rivers and volcanoes. There is a perpetual inhalation and  exhalation of the air rising and falling as the waters pass into the  depths of the earth and return again, in their course forming lakes  and rivers, but never descending below the centre of the earth; for on  either side the rivers flowing either way are stopped by a precipice.  These rivers are many and mighty, and there are four principal ones,  Oceanus, Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus. Oceanus is the river  which encircles the earth; Acheron takes an opposite direction, and  after flowing under the earth through desert places, at last reaches the  Acherusian lake,--this is the river at which the souls of the dead await  their return to earth. Pyriphlegethon is a stream of fire, which coils  round the earth and flows into the depths of Tartarus. The fourth river,  Cocytus, is that which is called by the poets the Stygian river, and  passes into and forms the lake Styx, from the waters of which it gains  new and strange powers. This river, too, falls into Tartarus.    The dead are first of all judged according to their deeds, and those who  are incurable are thrust into Tartarus, from which they never come out.  Those who have only committed venial sins are first purified of them,  and then rewarded for the good which they have done. Those who have  committed crimes, great indeed, but not unpardonable, are thrust  into Tartarus, but are cast forth at the end of a year by way of  Pyriphlegethon or Cocytus, and these carry them as far as the Acherusian  lake, where they call upon their victims to let them come out of the  rivers into the lake. And if they prevail, then they are let out and  their sufferings cease: if not, they are borne unceasingly into Tartarus  and back again, until they at last obtain mercy. The pure souls also  receive their reward, and have their abode in the upper earth, and a  select few in still fairer 'mansions.'    Socrates is not prepared to insist on the literal accuracy of this  description, but he is confident that something of the kind is true.  He who has sought after the pleasures of knowledge and rejected the  pleasures of the body, has reason to be of good hope at the approach of  death; whose voice is already speaking to him, and who will one day be  heard calling all men.    The hour has come at which he must drink the poison, and not much  remains to be done. How shall they bury him? That is a question which he  refuses to entertain, for they are burying, not him, but his dead body.  His friends had once been sureties that he would remain, and they shall  now be sureties that he has run away. Yet he would not die without the  customary ceremonies of washing and burial. Shall he make a libation of  the poison? In the spirit he will, but not in the letter. One request he  utters in the very act of death, which has been a puzzle to after ages.  With a sort of irony he remembers that a trifling religious duty is  still unfulfilled, just as above he desires before he departs to compose  a few verses in order to satisfy a scruple about a dream--unless,  indeed, we suppose him to mean, that he was now restored to health, and  made the customary offering to Asclepius in token of his recovery.    *****    1. The doctrine of the immortality of the soul has sunk deep into  the heart of the human race; and men are apt to rebel against any  examination of the nature or grounds of their belief. They do not like  to acknowledge that this, as well as the other 'eternal ideas; of  man, has a history in time, which may be traced in Greek poetry or  philosophy, and also in the Hebrew Scriptures. They convert feeling into  reasoning, and throw a network of dialectics over that which is really  a deeply-rooted instinct. In the same temper which Socrates reproves in  himself they are disposed to think that even fallacies will do no harm,  for they will die with them, and while they live they will gain by the  delusion. And when they consider the numberless bad arguments which have  been pressed into the service of theology, they say, like the companions  of Socrates, 'What argument can we ever trust again?' But there is a  better and higher spirit to be gathered from the Phaedo, as well as from  the other writings of Plato, which says that first principles should  be most constantly reviewed (Phaedo and Crat.), and that the highest  subjects demand of us the greatest accuracy (Republic); also that we  must not become misologists because arguments are apt to be deceivers.    2. In former ages there was a customary rather than a reasoned belief  in the immortality of the soul. It was based on the authority of the  Church, on the necessity of such a belief to morality and the order of  society, on the evidence of an historical fact, and also on analogies  and figures of speech which filled up the void or gave an expression  in words to a cherished instinct. The mass of mankind went on their  way busy with the affairs of this life, hardly stopping to think about  another. But in our own day the question has been reopened, and it is  doubtful whether the belief which in the first ages of Christianity  was the strongest motive of action can survive the conflict with a  scientific age in which the rules of evidence are stricter and the mind  has become more sensitive to criticism. It has faded into the distance  by a natural process as it was removed further and further from the  historical fact on which it has been supposed to rest. Arguments derived  from material things such as the seed and the ear of corn or transitions  in the life of animals from one state of being to another (the chrysalis  and the butterfly) are not 'in pari materia' with arguments from  the visible to the invisible, and are therefore felt to be no longer  applicable. The evidence to the historical fact seems to be weaker than  was once supposed: it is not consistent with itself, and is based upon  documents which are of unknown origin. The immortality of man must be  proved by other arguments than these if it is again to become a living  belief. We must ask ourselves afresh why we still maintain it, and seek  to discover a foundation for it in the nature of God and in the first  principles of morality.    3.
