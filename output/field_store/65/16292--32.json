Come, fairies, let us leave him. I am not friends with  him now.\"    \"It rests with you to make up the quarrel,\" said the King.    \"Give me that little Indian boy, and I will again be your humble servant  and suitor.\"    \"Set your mind at rest,\" said the Queen. \"Your whole fairy kingdom buys  not that boy from me. Come, fairies.\"    And she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.    \"Well, go your ways,\" said Oberon. \"But I'll be even with you before you  leave this wood.\"    Then Oberon called his favorite fairy, Puck. Puck was the spirit of  mischief. He used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and  get into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer  sour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at  them, and tumble people's stools from under them when they were going to  sit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were going  to drink.    \"Now,\" said Oberon to this little sprite, \"fetch me the flower called  Love-in-idleness. The juice of that little purple flower laid on the  eyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love the  first thing they see. I will put some of the juice of that flower on  my Titania's eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she  sees, were it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or a  busy ape.\"    While Puck was gone, Demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor  Helena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all  his promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love  her, and that his promises were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor  Helena, and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow  Demetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love  Helena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So  Puck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but  Lysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw  not his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking  for the cruel Demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left  his own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.    When Hermia woke she found Lysander gone, and wandered about the wood  trying to find him. Puck went back and told Oberon what he had done,  and Oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about looking  for Demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.  And the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke was also Helena. So now  Demetrius and Lysander were both following her through the wood, and it  was Hermia's turn to follow her lover as Helena had done before. The  end of it was that Helena and Hermia began to quarrel, and Demetrius and  Lysander went off to fight. Oberon was very sorry to see his kind scheme  to help these lovers turn out so badly. So he said to Puck--    \"These two young men are going to fight. You must overhang the night  with drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find the  other. When they are tired out, they will fall asleep. Then drop this  other herb on Lysander's eyes. That will give him his old sight and his  old love. Then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will  all think that this has been only a Midsummer Night's Dream. Then when  this is done, all will be well with them.\"    So Puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep  without meeting each other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander's eyes,  and said:--           \"When thou wakest,          Thou takest          True delight          In the sight          Of thy former lady's eye:          Jack shall have Jill;          Nought shall go ill.\"    Meanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme,  oxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There  Titania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin  of a snake. Oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes,  saying:--           \"What thou seest when thou wake,          Do it for thy true love take.\"    Now, it happened that when Titania woke the first thing she saw was a  stupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood  to rehearse their play. This clown had met with Puck, who had clapped  an ass's head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.  Directly Titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, \"What  angel is this? Are you as wise as you are beautiful?\"    \"If I am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that's enough for  me,\" said the foolish clown.    \"Do not desire to go out of the wood,\" said Titania. The spell of the  love-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautiful  and delightful creature on all the earth. \"I love you,\" she went on.  \"Come with me, and I will give you fairies to attend on you.\"    So she called four fairies, whose names were Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,  and Mustardseed.    \"You must attend this gentleman,\" said the Queen. \"Feed him with  apricots and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.  Steal honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of  painted butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.\"    \"I will,\" said one of the fairies, and all the others said, \"I will.\"    \"Now, sit down with me,\" said the Queen to the clown, \"and let me stroke  your dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and  kiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.\"    \"Where's Peaseblossom?\" asked the clown with the ass's head. He did not  care much about the Queen's affection, but he was very proud of having  fairies to wait on him. \"Ready,\" said Peaseblossom.    \"Scratch my head, Peaseblossom,\" said the clown. \"Where's Cobweb?\"  \"Ready,\" said Cobweb.    \"Kill me,\" said the clown, \"the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistle  yonder, and bring me the honey-bag. Where's Mustardseed?\"    \"Ready,\" said Mustardseed.    \"Oh, I want nothing,\" said the clown. \"Only just help Cobweb to scratch.  I must go to the barber's, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the  face.\"    \"Would you like anything to eat?\" said the fairy Queen.    \"I should like some good dry oats,\" said the clown--for his donkey's  head made him desire donkey's food--\"and some hay to follow.\"    \"Shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel's house?\"  asked the Queen.    \"I'd rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,\" said the clown.  \"But please don't let any of your people disturb me; I am going to  sleep.\"    Then said the Queen, \"And I will wind thee in my arms.\"    And so when Oberon came along he found his beautiful Queen lavishing  kisses and endearments on a clown with a donkey's head.    And before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to  give him the little Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he took  pity on her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on her  pretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed  clown she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.    Oberon took off the ass's head from the clown, and left him to finish  his sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.    Thus all was made plain and straight again. Oberon and Titania loved  each other more than ever. Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and  Helena had never had any thought of anyone but Demetrius.    As for Hermia and Lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could  meet in a day's march, even through a fairy wood.    So the four mortal lovers went back to Athens and were married; and the  fairy King and Queen live happily together in that very wood at this  very day.          THE TEMPEST        Prospero, the Duke of Milan, was a learned and studious man, who lived  among his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his brother  Antonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. But that trust was  ill-rewarded, for Antonio wanted to wear the duke's crown himself, and,  to gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the  people bore him. However, with the help of Prospero's great enemy,  Alonso, King of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom  with all its honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea,  and when they were far away from land, forced him into a little boat  with no tackle, mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his  little daughter, Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with  him, and sailed away, leaving them to their fate.    But one among the courtiers with Antonio was true to his rightful  master, Prospero. To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but  much could be done to remind him of a subject's love. So this worthy  lord, whose name was Gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh  water, provisions, and clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all,  some of his precious books.    The boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed  in safety. Now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under  the spell of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks  of trees all the good spirits she found there. She died shortly before  Prospero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was  the chief, still remained in their prisons.    Prospero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost  entirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed  his brother to manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the  imprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were  more truly his subjects than his people in Milan had been. For he  treated them kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#3)"],[1,"Buonaparte, whether pressed by poverty or  distracted by despair at the misfortunes which then overwhelmed Italy,  migrated to Corsica. There the family was grafted upon a tougher  branch of the Italian race. To the vulpine characteristics developed  under the shadow of the Medici there were now added qualities of a  more virile stamp. Though dominated in turn by the masters of the  Mediterranean, by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, by the men of Pisa,  and finally by the Genoese Republic, the islanders retained a striking  individuality. The rock-bound coast and mountainous interior helped to  preserve the essential features of primitive life. Foreign Powers  might affect the towns on the sea-board, but they left the clans of  the interior comparatively untouched. Their life centred around the  family. The Government counted for little or nothing; for was it not  the symbol of the detested foreign rule? Its laws were therefore as  naught when they conflicted with the unwritten but omnipotent code of  family honour. A slight inflicted on a neighbour would call forth the  warning words--\"Guard thyself: I am on my guard.\" Forthwith there  began a blood feud, a vendetta, which frequently dragged on its dreary  course through generations of conspiracy and murder, until, the  principals having vanished, the collateral branches of the families  were involved. No Corsican was so loathed as the laggard who shrank  from avenging the family honour, even on a distant relative of the  first offender. The murder of the Duc d'Enghien by Napoleon in 1804  sent a thrill of horror through the Continent. To the Corsicans it  seemed little more than an autocratic version of the _vendetta  traversale_.[1]    The vendetta was the chief law of Corsican society up to comparatively  recent times; and its effects are still visible in the life of the  stern islanders. In his charming romance, \"Colomba,\" M. Prosper  Merimee has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as  preoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his  dwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for  attack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in  the streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the  household, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and  watched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in  silence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first  warning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded  the word.    In such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where  woman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the  typical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,  brave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for  the glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon  was to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena  a chaotic France and a distracted Europe.    Amidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives  during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates  and lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical  importance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the  oft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa.  As became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the  Buonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a  document of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jerome, \"Egregius  Hieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium.\" These distinctions  they seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the  Corsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as  in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,  class distinctions were by no means so coveted as in lands that had  been thoroughly feudalized; and the Buonapartes, content with their  civic dignities at Ajaccio and the attachment of their partisans on  their country estates, seem rarely to have used the prefix which  implied nobility. Their life was not unlike that of many an old  Scottish laird, who, though possibly _bourgeois_ in origin, yet by  courtesy ranked as chieftain among his tenants, and was ennobled by  the parlance of the countryside, perhaps all the more readily because  he refused to wear the honours that came from over the Border.    But a new influence was now to call forth all the powers of this tough  stock. In the middle of the eighteenth century we find the head of the  family, Charles Marie Buonaparte, aglow with the flame of Corsican  patriotism then being kindled by the noble career of Paoli. This  gifted patriot, the champion of the islanders, first against the  Genoese and later against the French, desired to cement by education  the framework of the Corsican Commonwealth and founded a university.  It was here that the father of the future French Emperor received a  training in law, and a mental stimulus which was to lift his family  above the level of the _caporali_ and attorneys with whom its lot had  for centuries been cast. His ambition is seen in the endeavour,  successfully carried out by his uncle, Lucien, Archdeacon of Ajaccio,  to obtain recognition of kinship with the Buonapartes of Tuscany who  had been ennobled by the Grand Duke. His patriotism is evinced in his  ardent support of Paoli, by whose valour and energy the Genoese were  finally driven from the island. Amidst these patriotic triumphs  Charles confronted his destiny in the person of Letizia Ramolino, a  beautiful girl, descended from an honourable Florentine family which  had for centuries been settled in Corsica. The wedding took place in  1764, the bridegroom being then eighteen, and the bride fifteen years  of age. The union, if rashly undertaken in the midst of civil strifes,  was yet well assorted. Both parties to it were of patrician, if not  definitely noble descent, and came of families which combined the  intellectual gifts of Tuscany with the vigour of their later island  home[3]. From her mother's race, the Pietra Santa family, Letizia  imbibed the habits of the most backward and savage part of Corsica,  where vendettas were rife and education was almost unknown. Left in  ignorance in her early days, she yet was accustomed to hardships, and  often showed the fertility of resource which such a life always  develops. Hence, at the time of her marriage, she possessed a firmness  of will far beyond her years; and her strength and fortitude enabled  her to survive the terrible adversities of her early days, as also to  meet with quiet matronly dignity the extraordinary honours showered on  her as the mother of the French Emperor. She was inured to habits of  frugality, which reappeared in the personal tastes of her son. In  fact, she so far retained her old parsimonious habits, even amidst the  splendours of the French Imperial Court, as to expose herself to the  charge of avarice. But there is a touching side to all this. She seems  ever to have felt that after the splendour there would come again the  old days of adversity, and her instincts were in one sense correct.  She lived on to the advanced age of eighty-six, and died twenty-one  years after the break-up of her son's empire--a striking proof of the  vitality and tenacity of her powers.    A kindly Providence veiled the future from the young couple. Troubles  fell swiftly upon them both in private and in public life. Their first  two children died in infancy. The third, Joseph, was born in 1768,  when the Corsican patriots were making their last successful efforts  against their new French oppressors: the fourth, the famous Napoleon,  saw the light on August 15th, 1769, when the liberties of Corsica were  being finally extinguished. Nine other children were born before the  outbreak of the French Revolution reawakened civil strifes, amidst  which the then fatherless family was tossed to and fro and finally  whirled away to France.    Destiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon  Buonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in  Corsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the  hard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It  was a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the  Mediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had  previously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.  Yet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was  granted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the  coast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,  before the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French  commander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did  Rousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against  this bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his  compatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the  mountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and  clan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and  after the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking  with him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With  these irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but  accepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French  sway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to  Ajaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the  patriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, \"The Corsican people,  when exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced  Napoleon Buonaparte[5].\"    Seeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,  his sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He  certainly had not the grit "]]]
