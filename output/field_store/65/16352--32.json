He does not reach the  point of proposing a call-number system but stresses the importance of  shelf-location guides in the catalogue. He believes in aggressive  acquisition policies and the necessity of good faculty-librarian  relations, with the former advising the latter of the important books in  their fields of specialization. He urges what might now be called  \"interlibrary loan\" and other forms of sharing. To keep the librarian on  the straight and narrow, apparently a recurrent problem in Dury's day,  he recommends an annual meeting of a faculty board of governors where  the librarian will give his annual report and put on an exhibition of  the books he has acquired. To allay the temptation to make a little  money on the side by \"trading\" (Dury's obsessive term) in the library's  books for his personal profit, the librarian is to receive  administrative support for his various expenses during the year and, as  a scholar working with other scholars within his university instead of  as a mere factotum, the librarian is to receive an adequate salary  (perhaps the only one of Dury's reforms that must wait until the  millennium).    The question remains to what extent Dury's duties as the deputy  librarian of the King's Library allowed him to implement the reforms he  advocated on paper. The probable answer is, not very much. The  librarian's duties and responsibilities described by Dury are those of  an academic, university librarian, interacting with the faculty and  participating fully in the intellectual life of a scholarly community.  The role of the librarian of the King's Library would have been that of  keeper of a static and isolated collection, and Dury is particularly  critical of a merely custodial role: \"... their emploiment,\" he writes  of the typical librarian of his day, is \"of little or no use further,  then to look to the Books committed to their custodie, that they may not  bee lost; or embezeled by those that use them: and this is all\" (p. 16).    The King's Library was unquestionably magnificent; Charles's father and  brother Henry had been particularly zealous in building it up, acquiring  such collections as that of Isaac Casaubon. And Charles had been the  recipient in 1628 of perhaps its greatest single treasure, the Codex  Alexandrinus, a fifth-century manuscript of the Bible in Greek,  certainly an item that would have interested Dury. The library had, in  fact, great scholarly potential, but its continued existence was  apparently an embarrassment to the Commonwealth, and the Puritan  government merely wanted an overseer. So, by the determination of  others, the post of deputy keeper of the King's Library was little but a  sinecure for Dury, leaving him free to pursue his many other interests  but powerless to implement the reforms he advocated in his pamphlet  within the only library over which he ever had direct control. Though he  retained the post until the Restoration, he left the library itself  early in 1654, never to return.    The _DNB_ notes that Dury's life was \"an incessant round of journeyings,  colloquies, correspondence, and publications.\" The account might also  have added that, sadly, it was a life of many failures and frustrations,  since his visionary scheme for the wholeness of life was so out of touch  with the jealousies and rivalries of those he encountered. But if the  larger vision that underlay _The Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ is now merely  a historical curiosity, the specific reforms that Dury advocated, as  seemingly impractical in his own time as his other schemes, proved to be  of lasting importance. Shorn of the millenarian vision that gave them  their point in Dury's own day, his ideas have become the accepted  standards of modern librarianship. Dury himself would not have been  heartened by his secular acceptance: \"... For except Sciences bee  reformed in order to this Scope [of the Christian and millenarian  vision], the increas of knowledg will increas nothing but strife, pride  and confusion, from whence our sorrows will bee multiplied and  propagated unto posteritie....\" (p. 31).    _Thomas F.

A SUPPLEMENT TO THE _Reformed School_.      _Loving freind!_    You have offered to mee that which I confess I did not reflect upon,  when I wrote the discours you have Published under the name of a  _Reformed School_; which is, that som may think by the waie of  Education, which I propose all Universities and eminent places of  Learning might subtilly bee undermined and made useless, becaus therein  a waie is shew'd how to initiate youths not onely to the Principles of  all Religious and Rational knowledg, and in the Exercises of all Moral  virtues, but in the grounds of all Civil emploiments, so far, as will  make them fit for all profitable undertakings in humane societies,  whence this will follow (in their apprehensions) that they shall have no  advantage by beeing sent to anie Universities, to attein anie further  perfection: becaus the Universities will not bee able to add anie thing  unto them, which by their own Industrie, they may not afterward attein  anie where els, as well as there.

Let us take an example which is salient enough; for, however arbitrary  the conventional division of time may appear to a physicist's eyes, it  is natural, when instituting a comparison between two epochs, to  choose those which extend over a space of half a score of years, and  are separated from each other by the gap of a century. Let us, then,  go back a hundred years and examine what would have been the state of  mind of an erudite amateur who had read and understood the chief  publications on physical research between 1800 and 1810.    Let us suppose that this intelligent and attentive spectator witnessed  in 1800 the discovery of the galvanic battery by Volta. He might from  that moment have felt a presentiment that a prodigious transformation  was about to occur in our mode of regarding electrical phenomena.  Brought up in the ideas of Coulomb and Franklin, he might till then  have imagined that electricity had unveiled nearly all its mysteries,  when an entirely original apparatus suddenly gave birth to  applications of the highest interest, and excited the blossoming of  theories of immense philosophical extent.    In the treatises on physics published a little later, we find traces  of the astonishment produced by this sudden revelation of a new world.  \"Electricity,\" wrote the Abbe Hauey, \"enriched by the labour of so many  distinguished physicists, seemed to have reached the term when a  science has no further important steps before it, and only leaves to  those who cultivate it the hope of confirming the discoveries of their  predecessors, and of casting a brighter light on the truths revealed.  One would have thought that all researches for diversifying the  results of experiment were exhausted, and that theory itself could  only be augmented by the addition of a greater degree of precision to  the applications of principles already known. While science thus  appeared to be making for repose, the phenomena of the convulsive  movements observed by Galvani in the muscles of a frog when connected  by metal were brought to the attention and astonishment of  physicists.... Volta, in that Italy which had been the cradle of the  new knowledge, discovered the principle of its true theory in a fact  which reduces the explanation of all the phenomena in question to the  simple contact of two substances of different nature. This fact became  in his hands the germ of the admirable apparatus to which its manner  of being and its fecundity assign one of the chief places among those  with which the genius of mankind has enriched physics.\"    Shortly afterwards, our amateur would learn that Carlisle and  Nicholson had decomposed water by the aid of a battery; then, that  Davy, in 1803, had produced, by the help of the same battery, a quite  unexpected phenomenon, and had succeeded in preparing metals endowed  with marvellous properties, beginning with substances of an earthy  appearance which had been known for a long time, but whose real nature  had not been discovered.    In another order of ideas, surprises as prodigious would wait for our  amateur. Commencing with 1802, he might have read the admirable series  of memoirs which Young then published, and might thereby have learned  how the study of the phenomena of diffraction led to the belief that  the undulation theory, which, since the works of Newton seemed  irretrievably condemned, was, on the contrary, beginning quite a new  life. A little later--in 1808--he might have witnessed the discovery  made by Malus of polarization by reflexion, and would have been able  to note, no doubt with stupefaction, that under certain conditions a  ray of light loses the property of being reflected.    He might also have heard of one Rumford, who was then promulgating  very singular ideas on the nature of heat, who thought that the then  classical notions might be false, that caloric does not exist as a  fluid, and who, in 1804, even demonstrated that heat is created by  friction. A few years later he would learn that Charles had enunciated  a capital law on the dilatation of gases; that Pierre Prevost, in  1809, was making a study, full of original ideas, on radiant heat. In  the meantime he would not have failed to read volumes iii. and iv. of  the _Mecanique celeste_ of Laplace, published in 1804 and 1805, and he  might, no doubt, have thought that before long mathematics would  enable physical science to develop with unforeseen safety.    All these results may doubtless be compared in importance with the  present discoveries. When strange metals like potassium and sodium  were isolated by an entirely new method, the astonishment must have  been on a par with that caused in our time by the magnificent  discovery of radium. The polarization of light is a phenomenon as  undoubtedly singular as the existence of the X rays; and the upheaval  produced in natural philosophy by the theories of the disintegration  of matter and the ideas concerning electrons is probably not more  considerable than that produced in the theories of light and heat by  the works of Young and Rumford.    If we now disentangle ourselves from contingencies, it will be  understood that in reality physical science progresses by evolution  rather than by revolution. Its march is continuous. The facts which  our theories enable us to discover, subsist and are linked together  long after these theories have disappeared. Out of the materials of  former edifices overthrown, new dwellings are constantly being  reconstructed.    The labour of our forerunners never wholly perishes. The ideas of  yesterday prepare for those of to-morrow; they contain them, so to  speak, _in potentia_. Science is in some sort a living organism, which  gives birth to an indefinite series of new beings taking the places of  the old, and which evolves according to the nature of its environment,  adapting itself to external conditions, and healing at every step the  wounds which contact with reality may have occasioned.    Sometimes this evolution is rapid, sometimes it is slow enough; but it  obeys the ordinary laws. The wants imposed by its surroundings create  certain organs in science. The problems set to physicists by the  engineer who wishes to facilitate transport or to produce better  illumination, or by the doctor who seeks to know how such and such a  remedy acts, or, again, by the physiologist desirous of understanding  the mechanism of the gaseous and liquid exchanges between the cell and  the outer medium, cause new chapters in physics to appear, and suggest  researches adapted to the necessities of actual life.    The evolution of the different parts of physics does not, however,  take place with equal speed, because the circumstances in which they  are placed are not equally favourable. Sometimes a whole series of  questions will appear forgotten, and will live only with a languishing  existence; and then some accidental circumstance suddenly brings them  new life, and they become the object of manifold labours, engross  public attention, and invade nearly the whole domain of science.    We have in our own day witnessed such a spectacle. The discovery of  the X rays--a discovery which physicists no doubt consider as the  logical outcome of researches long pursued by a few scholars working  in silence and obscurity on an otherwise much neglected subject--  seemed to the public eye to have inaugurated a new era in the history  of physics. If, as is the case, however, the extraordinary scientific  movement provoked by Roentgen's sensational experiments has a very  remote origin, it has, at least, been singularly quickened by the  favourable conditions created by the interest aroused in its  astonishing applications to radiography.    A lucky chance has thus hastened an evolution already taking place,  and theories previously outlined have received a singular development.  Without wishing to yield too much to what may be considered a whim of  fashion, we cannot, if we are to note in this book the stage actually  reached in the continuous march of physics, refrain from giving a  clearly preponderant place to the questions suggested by the study of  the new radiations. At the present time it is these questions which  move us the most; they have shown us unknown horizons, and towards the  fields recently opened to scientific activity the daily increasing  crowd of searchers rushes in rather disorderly fashion.    One of the most interesting consequences of the recent discoveries has  been to rehabilitate in the eyes of scholars, speculations relating to  the constitution of matter, and, in a more general way, metaphysical  problems. Philosophy has, of course, never been completely separated  from science; but in times past many physicists dissociated themselves  from studies which they looked upon as unreal word-squabbles, and  sometimes not unreasonably abstained from joining in discussions which  seemed to them idle and of rather puerile subtlety. They had seen the  ruin of most of the systems built up _a priori_ by daring  philosophers, and deemed it more prudent to listen to the advice given  by Kirchhoff and \"to substitute the description of facts for a sham  explanation of nature.\"    It should however be remarked that these physicists somewhat deceived  themselves as to the value of their caution, and that the mistrust  they manifested towards philosophical speculations did not preclude  their admitting, unknown to themselves, certain axioms which they did  not discuss, but which are, properly speaking, metaphysical  conceptions. They were unconsciously speaking a language taught them  by their predecessors, of which they made no attempt to"]]]
