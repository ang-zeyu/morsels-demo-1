Thus if a screw sends 100 tons of water astern at a speed of 10  ft. per second per second, the work wasted will be 156 foot tons per  second in round numbers. If a hydraulic propeller sent 10 tons astern  at 100 ft. per second per second, the work done on it would be 1,562  foot tons per second, or ten times as much. But the reaction effort,  or thrust on the ship, would be the same in both cases. The waste of  energy would, under such circumstances, be ten times as great with the  hydraulic propeller as with the screw. In other words, the slip would  be magnified in that proportion. Of course, it will be understood that  we are not taking into account resistances, and defects proper to the  screw, from which hydraulic propulsion is free, nor are we considering  certain drawbacks to the efficiency of the hydraulic propeller, from  which the screw is exempt; all that we are dealing with is the waste  of power in the shape of work done in moving water astern which we do  not want to move, but cannot help moving. If our readers have followed  us so far, they will now understand the bearing of Rankine's  proposition, that that propeller is best which moves the greatest  quantity of water astern at the slowest speed. The weight of water  moved is one factor of the thrust, and consequently the greater that  weight, other things being equal, the greater the propelling force  brought to bear on the ship.    It may be urged, and with propriety, that the results obtained in  practice with the jet propeller are more favorable than our reasoning  would indicate as possible; but it will be seen that we have taken no  notice of conditions which seriously affect the performance of a  screw. There is no doubt that it puts water in motion not astern. It  twists it up in a rope, so to speak. Its skin frictional resistance is  very great. In a word, in comparing the hydraulic system with the  normal system, we are comparing two very imperfect things together;  but the fact remains, and applies up to a certain point, that the  hydraulic propeller must be very inefficient, because it, of all  propellers, drives the smallest quantity of water astern at the  highest velocity.    There is, moreover, another and a very serious defect in the hydraulic  propeller as usually made, which is that every ton of water passed  through it has the velocity of the ship herself suddenly imparted to  it. That is to say, the ship has to drag water with her. To illustrate  our meaning, let us suppose that a canal boat passes below a stage or  platform a mile long, on which are arranged a series of sacks of corn.  Let it further be supposed that as the canal boat passes along the  platform, at a speed of say five miles an hour, one sack shall be  dropped into the boat and another dropped overboard continuously. It  is evident that each sack, while it remains in the boat, will have a  speed the same as that of the boat, though it had none before. Work  consequently is done on each sack, in overcoming its inertia by  imparting a velocity of five miles an hour to it, and all this work  must be done by the horse towing on the bank. In like manner the  hydraulic propeller boat is continually taking in tons of water,  imparting her own velocity to them, and then throwing them overboard.  The loss of efficiency from this source may become enormous. So great,  indeed, is the resistance due to this cause that it precludes the  notion of anything like high speeds being attained. We do not mean to  assert that a moderate degree of efficiency may not be got from  hydraulic propulsion, but it can only be had by making the quantity of  water sent astern as great as possible and its velocity as small as  possible. That is to say, very large nozzles must be employed. Again,  provision will have to be made for sending the water through the  propeller in such a way that it shall have as little as possible of  the motion of the ship imparted to it. But as soon as we begin to  reduce these principles to practice, it will be seen that we get  something very like a paddle wheel hung in the middle of the boat and  working through an aperture in her hull, or else a screw propeller put  into a tube traversing her from stem to stern.    We may sum up by saying that the hydraulic propeller is less efficient  than the screw, because it does more work on the water and less on the  boat; and that the boat in turn does more work on the water than does  one propelled by a screw, because she has to take in thousands of tons  per hour and impart to them a velocity equal to her own. Part of this  work is got back again in a way sufficiently obvious, but not all. If  it were all wasted, the efficiency of the hydraulic propeller would be  so low that nothing would be heard about it, and we certainly should  not have written this article.--_The Engineer._           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW ARMY GUN.      The cut we give is from a photograph taken shortly after the recent  firings. The carriage upon which it is mounted is the one designed by  the Department and manufactured by the West Point Foundry, about six  months since. It was designed as a proof carriage for this gun and  also for the 10 inch steel gun in course of construction. It is  adapted to the larger gun by introducing two steel bushing rings  fitted into the cheeks of carriage to secure the trunnion of the gun.    The gun represented is an 8 inch, all steel, breech-loading rifle,  manufactured by the West Point Foundry, upon designs from the Army  Ordnance Bureau. The tube and jacket were obtained from Whitworth, and  the hoops and the breech mechanism forgings from the Midvale Steel  Company. The total weight of the gun is 13 tons; total length,  including breech mechanism, 271 inches; length of bore in front of gas  check, 30 calibers; powder space in chamber, 3,109 cubic inches;  charge, 100 pounds. The tube extends back to breech recess from  muzzle, in one solid piece. The breech block is carried in the jacket,  the thread cut in the rear portion of the jacket. The jacket extends  forward and is shrunk over the tube about 871/2 inches. The re-enforce  is strengthened by two rows of steel hoops; the trunnion hoops form  one of the outer layers. In front of the jacket a single row of hoops  is shrunk on the tube and extends toward the muzzle, leaving 91 inches  of the muzzle end of the tube unhooped. The second row of hoops is  shrunk on forward of the trunnion hoops for a length of 38 inches to  strengthen the gun, and the hoop portion forms three conical frustums.  The elastic resistance of the gun to tangential rupture over the  powder chamber is computed by Claverino and kindred formulas to be  54,000 lb. per square inch.    [Illustration: THE ARMY 8 INCH STEEL GUN WITH CARRIAGE.]    The breech mechanism is modeled after the De Bange system. The block  has three smooth and three threaded sectors, and is locked in place by  one-sixth of a turn of a block, and secured by the eccentric end of a  heavy lever, which revolves into a cut made in the rear breech of the  gun. The gas check consists of a pad made of two steel plates or cups,  between which is a pad of asbestos and mutton suet formed under heavy  pressure. The rifling consists of narrow grooves and bands, 45 of  each. The depth of the groove is six one-hundredths of an inch.    Although the gun is designed for a charge of 100 pounds, it is  believed that it can be increased to 105 pounds without giving  dangerous pressure, and the intention is to increase the charge to  that amount when the new powder is received from Du Pont.    The following is a very full synopsis of the official report of the  preliminary firings--13 rounds--with this gun:    The first seven rounds were fired with German cocoa powder, which was  received from Watervliet Arsenal. There were two kinds of cartridges,  one kind weighing 85 pounds, and having 30 grains in each layer, the  other weighing 100 lb., and having 27 grains in each layer. In two of  the first seven rounds the weight of the charge was 65 pounds, the  projectiles weighing 182 and 286 pounds; in the next two rounds  charges of 85 pounds were fired, the projectiles, as before, weighing  182 and 286 pounds, while in the last three of the rounds fired with  cocoa powder the charge was 100 lb., while the weight of the  projectile was 182, 235, and 286 pounds. At the seventh round was  fired the normal charge, 100 lb. of powder and a projectile weighing  286 pounds, for which the gun was designed. The mean pressure for this  round, determined by two crusher gauges, was 32,800 pounds, and the  velocity at 150 feet was 1,787 feet.    Two kinds of Du Pont's brown prismatic powder, marked P.A. and P.I.,  were then fired. With the normal charge of P.A. powder (round 12 of  the record), the mean pressure was 35,450 pounds, the velocity at 150  feet was 1,812 feet. For P.I. powder (round 13 of the record), the  pressure was 26,925 pounds, the velocity was 1,702 feet, and a  considerable amount of unconsumed powder was ejected, showing that the  P.I. powder is not a suitable one for this piece. The highest pressure  indicated with the normal charge of P.A. powder was 36,200 pounds,  exceeding by 1,200 pounds the provisional limit of pressure.    At the fifth round the breech block opened with some difficulty, and  an examination showed that the resistance resulted from the diametral  enlargement of the rear plate. Directions have been given to correct  this defect. The star gauge records show that no material change took  place in the diameter of the chamber or the bore. From 30 inches to 54  inches (measured from base of the breech), there was a diminution in  diameter of from 0.001 in. to 0.002 in.; in rear of 30 inches there  was no change. No enlargement in the shot chamber exceeded 0.001 in.

I have not yet been able to complete the list of officers whose names I  desire to bring to your Lordship's notice for services rendered during  the period under review; and, as I understand it is of importance that  this dispatch should no longer be delayed, I propose to forward this  list, separately, as soon as I can. I have the honor to be,    Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,    (Signed) J.D.P. FRENCH,  Field Marshal,  Commander in Chief, British Forces in the Field.          II.    *The Battle of the Marne.*      17th September, 1914.    My lord: In continuation of my dispatch of Sept. 7, I have the honor to  report the further progress of the operations of the forces under my  command from Aug. 28.    On that evening the retirement of the force was followed closely by two  of the enemy's cavalry columns, moving southeast from St. Quentin.    The retreat in this part of the field was being covered by the Third and  Fifth Cavalry Brigades. South of the Somme Gen. Gough, with the Third  Cavalry Brigade, threw back the Uhlans of the Guard with considerable  loss.    Gen. Chetwode, with the Fifth Cavalry Brigade, encountered the eastern  column near Cerizy, moving south. The brigade attacked and routed the  column, the leading German regiment suffering very severe casualties  and being almost broken up.    The Seventh French Army Corps was now in course of being railed up from  the south to the east of Amiens. On the 29th it nearly completed its  detrainment, and the French Sixth Army got into position on my left, its  right resting on Roye.    The Fifth French Army was behind the line of the Oise, between La Fere  and Guise.    The pursuit of the enemy was very vigorous; some five or six German  corps were on the Somme, facing the Fifth Army on the Oise. At least two  corps were advancing toward my front, and were crossing the Somme east  and west of Ham. Three or four more German corps were [Transcriber:  original 'wree'] opposing the Sixth French Army on my left.    This was the situation at 1 o'clock on the 29th, when I received a visit  from Gen. Joffre at my headquarters.    I strongly represented my position to the French Commander in Chief, who  was most kind, cordial, and sympathetic, as he has always been. He told  me that he had directed the Fifth French Army on the Oise to move  forward and attack the Germans on the Somme, with a view to checking  pursuit. He also told me of the formation of the Sixth French Army on my  left flank, composed of the Seventh Army Corps, four reserve divisions,  and Sordet's corps of cavalry.    I finally arranged with Gen. Joffre to effect a further short retirement  toward the line Compiegne-Soissons, promising him, however, to do my  utmost to keep always within a day's march of him.    In pursuance of this arrangement the British forces retired to a  position a few miles north of the line Compiegne-Soissons on the 29th.    The right flank of the German Army was now reaching a point which  appeared seriously to endanger my line of communications with Havre. I  had already evacuated Amiens, into which place a German reserve division  was reported to have moved.    [Illustration: Map 4.--Sept. 6 (Sunday), evening. First advance toward  the line of the Grand Morin.]    Orders were given to change the base to St. Nazaire, and establish an  advance base at Le Mans. This operation was well carried out by the  Inspector General of Communications.    In spite of a severe defeat inflicted upon the Guard Tenth and Guard  Reserve Corps of the German Army by the First and Third French Corps on  the right of the Fifth Army, it was not part of Gen. Joffre's plan to  pursue this advantage; and a general retirement to the line of the Marne  was ordered, to which the French forces in the more eastern theatre were  directed to conform.    A new Army (the Ninth) had been formed from three corps in the south by  Gen. Joffre, and moved into the space between the right of the Fifth and  left of the Fourth Armies.    While closely adhering to his strategic conception to draw the enemy on  at all points until a favorable situation was created from which to  assume the offensive, Gen. Joffre found it necessary to modify from day  to day the methods by which he sought to attain this object, owing to  the development of the enemy's plans and changes in the general  situation.    In conformity with the movements of the French forces, my retirement  continued practically from day to day. Although we were not severely  pressed by the enemy, rearguard actions took place continually.    On the 1st September, when retiring from the thickly wooded country to  the south of Compiegne, the First Cavalry Brigade was overtaken by some  German cavalry. They momentarily lost a horse artillery battery, and  several officers and men were killed and wounded. With the help,  however, of some detachments from the Third Corps operating on their  left, they not only recovered their own guns, but succeeded in capturing  twelve of the enemy's.    Similarly, to the eastward, the First Corps, retiring south, also got  into some very difficult forest country, and a somewhat severe rearguard  action ensued at Villers-Cotterets, in which the Fourth Guards Brigade  suffered considerably.    On Sept. 3 the British forces were in position south of the Marne  between Lagny and Signy-Signets. Up to this time I had been requested by  Gen. Joffre to defend the passages of the river as long as possible, and  to blow up the bridges in my front. After I had made the necessary  dispositions, and the destruction of the bridges had been effected, I  was asked by the French Commander in Chief to continue my retirement to  a point some twelve miles in rear of the position I then occupied, with  a view to taking up a second position behind the Seine. This retirement  was duly carried out. In the meantime the enemy had thrown bridges and  crossed the Marne in considerable force, and was threatening the Allies  all along the line of the British forces and the Fifth and Ninth French  Armies. Consequently several small outpost actions took place.    On Saturday, Sept. 5, I met the French Commander in Chief at his  request, and he informed me of his intention to take the offensive  forthwith, as he considered conditions very favorable to success.    Gen. Joffre announced to me his intention of wheeling up the left flank  of the Sixth Army, pivoting on the Marne and directing it to move on the  Ourcq; cross and attack the flank of the First German Army, which was  then moving in a southeasterly direction east of that river.    He requested me to effect a change of front to my right--my left resting  on the Marne and my right on the Fifth Army--to fill the gap between  that army and the Sixth. I was then to advance against the enemy in my  front and join in the general offensive movement.    These combined movements practically commenced on Sunday, Sept. 6, at  sunrise; and on that day it may be said that a great battle opened on a  front extending from Ermenonville, which was just in front of the left  flank of the Sixth French Army, through Lizy on the Marne, Mauperthuis,  which was about the British centre, Courtecon, which was on the left of  the Fifth French Army, to Esternay and Charleville, the left of the  Ninth Army under Gen. Foch, and so along the front of the Ninth, Fourth  and Third French Armies to a point north of the fortress of Verdun.    [Illustration: Map 5.--Sept. 8. Battle of the Marne.  The great advance to the Petit Morin and the Marne, where important  captures were made by the British.]    This battle, in so far as the Sixth French Army, the British Army, the  Fifth French Army, and the Ninth French Army were concerned, may be said  to have concluded on the evening of Sept. 10, by which time the Germans  had been driven back to the line Soissons-Rheims, with a loss of  thousands of prisoners, many guns, and enormous masses of transport.    About Sept. 3 the enemy appears to have changed his plans and to have  determined to stop his advance south direct upon Paris, for on Sept. 4  air reconnoissances showed that his main columns were moving in a  southeasterly direction generally east of a line drawn through Nanteuil  and Lizy on the Ourcq.    On Sept. 5 several of these columns were observed to have crossed the  Marne, while German troops, which were observed moving southeast up the  left flank of the Ourcq on the 4th, were now reported to be halted and  facing that river. Heads of the enemy's columns were seen crossing at  Changis, La Ferte, Nogent, Chateau Thierry, and Mezy.    Considerable German columns of all arms were seen to be converging on  Montmirail, while before sunset large bivouacs of the enemy were located  in the neighborhood of Coulommiers, south of Rebais, La Ferte-Gaucher,  and Dagny.    I should conceive it to have been about noon on Sept. 6, after the  British forces had changed their front to the right and occupied the  line Jouy-Le Chatel-Faremoutiers-Villeneuve Le Comte, and the advance of  the Sixth French Army north of the Marne toward the Ourcq became  apparent, that the enemy realized the powerful threat that was being  made against the flank of his columns moving southeast, and began the  great retreat which opened the battle above referred to.    On the evening of Sept. 6, therefore, the fronts and positions of the  opposing armies were roughly as follows:        Allies.        _Sixth French Army_.--Right on the Marne at Meux, left toward Betz.        _British Forces._--On the line Dagny-Coulommiers-Maison.        _Fifth French Army._--At Courtagon, right on Esternay.        _Conneau's Cavalry Corps._--Between the right of the British and the      left of the French Fifth Army.        Germans.        _Fourth Reserve and Second Corps._--East of the Ourcq and facing      that river.        _Ninth"]]]
