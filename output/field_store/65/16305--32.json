The novels become  epitomes of the history of the time. No type of character may be  omitted. So popes and emperors, monks and missionaries, German  warriors and Roman warriors, minstrels and students, knights,  crusaders, colonists, landskechts, and mercenaries are dragged in and  made to do their part with all too evident fidelity to truth.    We owe much of our knowledge of Freytag's life to a charming  autobiography which served as a prefatory volume to his collected  works. Freytag lived to a ripe old age, dying in 1895 at the age of  seventy-nine. Both as a newspaper editor and as a member of parliament  (the former from 1848 to 1860, the latter for the four years from 1867  to 1871) he had shown his patriotism and his interest in public  affairs. Many of his numerous essays, written for the _Grenzboten_,  are little masterpieces and are to be found among his collected works  published in 1888. As a member of parliament, indeed, he showed no  marked ability and his name is associated with no important measure.    Not to conceal his shortcoming it must be said that Freytag, at the  time of the accession to the throne of the present head of the German  Empire, laid himself open to much censure by attacking the memory of  the dead Emperor Frederick who had always been his friend and patron.    In conclusion it may be said that no one claims for Freytag a place in  the front rank of literary geniuses. He is no Goethe, no Schiller, no  Dante, no Milton, no Shakespeare. He is not a pioneer, has not changed  the course of human thought. But yet he is an artist of whom his  country may well be proud, who has added to the happiness of hundreds  of thousands of Germans, and who only needs to be better understood to  be thoroughly enjoyed by foreigners.    England and America have much to learn from him--the value of long,  careful, and unremitting study; the advantage of being thoroughly  familiar with the scenes and types of character depicted; the charm of  an almost unequaled simplicity and directness. He possessed the rare  gift of being able to envelop every topic that he touched with an  atmosphere of elegance and distinction. His productions are not  ephemeral, but are of the kind that will endure.           *       *       *       *       *          _GUSTAV FREYTAG_                 *       *       *       *       *    #THE JOURNALISTS#          DRAMATIS PERSONAE      BERG, _retired Colonel_.

HENDERSON, PH.D., L.H.D.          ACT I      SCENE I      _A summer parlor in the_ COLONEL'S _house. Handsome furnishings. In  the centre of rear wall an open door, behind it a verandah and garden;  on the sides of rear wall large windows. Right and left, doors; on the  right, well in front, a window. Tables, chairs, a small sofa_.    IDA _is sitting in front on the right reading a book. The_ COLONEL  _enters through centre door with an open box in his hand in which are  dahlias_.    COLONEL.    Here, Ida, are the new varieties of dahlias our gardener has grown.  You'll have to rack your brains to find names for them. Day after  tomorrow is the Horticultural Society meeting, when I am to exhibit  and christen them.    IDA.    This light-colored one here should be called the \"Adelaide.\"    COLONEL.    Adelaide Buneck, of course. Your own name is out of the running, for  as a little dahlia you have long been known to the flower-trade.    IDA.    One shall be called after your favorite writer, \"Boz.\"    COLONEL.    Splendid! And it must be a really fine one, this yellow one here with  violet points. And the third one--how shall we christen that?    IDA (_stretching out her hand entreatingly to her father_).    \"Edward Oldendorf.\"    COLONEL.    What! The professor? The editor? Oh no, that will not do! It was bad  enough for him to take over the paper; but that he now has allowed  himself to be led by his party into running for Parliament--that I can  never forgive him.    IDA.    Here he comes himself.    COLONEL (_aside_).    It used to be a pleasure to me to hear his footstep; now I can hardly  keep from being rude when I see him.    _Enter_ OLDENDORF.    OLDENDORF.    Good morning, Colonel!    IDA (_with a friendly greeting_).    Good morning, Edward. Help me to admire the new dahlias that father  has grown.    COLONEL.    But do not trouble the professor. Such trifles no longer interest him;  he has bigger things in his head.    OLDENDORF.    At all events I have not lost my ability to enjoy what gives you  pleasure.    COLONEL (_grumbling to himself_).    You have not given me much proof of that. I fear you take pleasure in  doing the very things that vex me. You are doubtless quite busy now  with your election, Mr. Future Member of Parliament!    OLDENDORF.    You know, Colonel, that I myself have less than any one else to do  with it.    COLONEL.    Oh, I don't believe that! It is the usual custom in such elections, I  imagine, to pay court to influential persons and shake hands with the  voters, to make speeches, scatter promises, and do all the other  little devil's tricks.    OLDENDORF.    You yourself do not believe, Colonel, that I would do anything  discreditable?    COLONEL.    Not? I am not so sure, Oldendorf. Since you have turned journalist,  edit your _Union_ and daily reproach the State with its faulty  organization, you are no longer what you used to be.    OLDENDORF (_who up to this point has been conversing with_ IDA _about  the flowers, but now turns to the_ COLONEL).    Does what I now say or write conflict with my former views? It would  be hard to convince me of that. And still less can you have noticed  any change in my feelings or in my conduct toward you.    COLONEL (_obdurate_).    Well, I don't see what reason you would have for that. I am not going  to spoil my morning by quarreling. Ida may try to straighten things  out with you. I am going to my flowers. [_Takes the box and exit  toward the garden._]    OLDENDORF.    What has put your father in such a bad humor? Has something in the  newspaper vexed him again?    IDA.    I do not think so. But it annoys him that now in politics you again  find it necessary to advocate measures he detests and attack  institutions he reveres. (_Shyly._) Edward, is it really impossible  for you to withdraw from the election?    OLDENDORF.    It is impossible.    IDA.    I should then have you here, and father could regain his good humor;  for he would highly appreciate the sacrifice you were making for him,  and we could look forward to a future as peaceful as our past has  been.    OLDENDORF.    I know that, Ida, and I feel anything but pleasure at the prospect of  becoming member for this town; yet I cannot withdraw.    IDA (_turning away_).    Father is right. You have changed entirely since becoming editor of  the paper.    OLDENDORF.    Ida! You too! If this is going to cause discord between us I shall  indeed feel badly.    IDA.    Dear Edward! I am only grieving at losing you for so long.    OLDENDORF.    I am not yet elected. If I do become member and can have my way, I  will take you to the capital and never let you leave my side again.    IDA.    Ah, Edward, we can't think of that now! But do spare father.    OLDENDORF.    You know how much I stand from him; and I don't give up hope of his  becoming reconciled to me. The election once over, I will make another  appeal to his heart. I may wrest from him a favorable answer that will  mean our marriage.    IDA.    But do humor his little foibles. He is in the garden near his dahlia  bed; express your delight over the gay colors. If you go at it  skilfully enough perhaps he may still call one the \"Edward Oldendorf.\"  We have been talking of it already. Come! [_Exeunt both._]    _Enter_ SENDEN, BLUMENBERG, CARL, SCHMOCK.    SENDEN (_entering_).    Is the Colonel alone?    CARL.    Professor Oldendorf is with him.    SENDEN.    Take in our names. [_Exit_ CARL.] This everlasting Oldendorf! I say,  Blumenberg, this connection of the old gentleman with the _Union_ must  stop. We cannot really call him one of us so long as the professor  frequents this house. We need the Colonel's influential personality.    BLUMENBERG.    It is the best-known house in town--the best society, good wine, and  art.    SENDEN.    I have my private reasons, too, for bringing the Colonel over to our  side. And everywhere the professor and his clique block our way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14472"],[0,"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham (#3)"],[1,"ion_.    ~Ales and Alehouses~ were known in this country nearly 1,200 years ago,  but the national beverage was not taxed until 1551, a few years previous  to which (1535) hops were first used in place of wormwood, &c. In 1603  it was enacted that not more than 1d. (equal to 9d. value now) should be  charged per quart for the best ale or beer, or for two quarts of the  \"smaller\" sort. An additional excise duty was imposed on ale and beer in  1643. See also _Breweries_.    ~Almanacks.~--The first English-printed Almanack was for the year 1497,  and the London Stationers' Company had the monopoly of printing them for  nearly 300 years. The first locally printed Almanack was the \"Diaria  Britannica\" (or \"British Diary\"), by Messrs. Pearson and Rollason,  issued in 1787 for 1788, at 9d. per copy, in addition to the 1s. 6d.  required for stamp duty. It was barely half the size and not a tenth the  value of the \"Diary\" published by Messrs Walter Showell and Sons, and of  which 20,000 copies are given away annually. The stamp duty was removed  from Almanacks in 1834. \"Showell's Almanack\" in past years was highly  esteemed before we had been supplied with \"Moody's,\" the \"Red Book,\"  &c., and a copy of it for the year 1839 is valuable as a curiosity, it  being issued with a partly printed page with blanks left for the  insertion of the names of the members of the Corporation, whose first  election under the charter of incorporation was about to take place. To  prevent any mistake, the \"Esqrs.\" were carefully printed in where the  names of the new Aldermen were to go, the blanks for Councillors being  only honoured with a \"Mr.\"    ~Almshouses~ for Lench's Trust were built in Steelhouse Lane in 1764. In  later years other sets of houses have been built in Conybere Street,  Hospital Street, Ravenhurst Street, and Ladywood Road, the inmates, all  women, numbering 182. Jas. Dowell's Almshouses in Warner Street,  consisting of 20 houses and a chapel, known as the \"Retreat,\" were built  in 1820. Mrs. Glover's Almshouses in Steelhouse Lane for 36 aged women,  were erected in 1832. James Lloyd's twenty-four Almshouses in Belgrave  Street were erected in 1869.    ~Aluminium.~--This valuable material for the use of one of our staple  trades was first obtained by a German chemist in 1837, but was not  produced in sufficient quantity for manufacturing purposes until 1854,  at which time its market value was 60s. per oz. It gradually cheapened,  until it is now priced at 5s., and a company has lately been formed for  its more easy manufacture, who promise to supply it at about as many  pence.    ~Amphitheatres.~--Astley's celebrated amphitheatre was brought here in  October, 1787. Mr. and Mrs. Astley themselves had performed in  Birmingham as early as 1772.--A local amphitheatre was opened in Livery  Street in 1787, on the present site of Messrs. Billing's printing works.  After the riots of 1791 it was used for a time by the congregations of  Old and New Meeting, while their own chapels were being rebuilt. An  attempt to bring it back to its old uses failed, and \"the properties\"  were sold Nov. 25, 1795. Several sects occupied it in after years, the  last being the Latter-Day Saints. It was taken down in 1848.--Another  amphitheatre was opened at Bingley Hall, December 29, 1853, by the  plucky but unlucky John Tonks, a well-known caterer for the public's  amusement.    ~Amusement,~ Places of--Notes of the Theatres, Concert Halls, Parks,  &c., will be found under the several headings. Among the most popular  series of concerts of late years have been those of a Saturday evening  (at 3d. admission) in the Town Hall, which began on Nov. 8, 1879, and  are continued to present date.    ~Analyst.~--Dr. Hill was appointed Borough Analyst in Feb., 1861, his  duties being to examine and test any sample of food or drinks that may  be brought or sent to him in order to prove their purity or otherwise.  The fees are limited to a scale approved by the Town Council.    ~Ancient History~ of Birmingham can hardly be said to exist. Its rise  and progress is essentially modern, and the few notes that have come to  us respecting its early history will be found briefly summarised at the  commencement of this book.    ~Anti-Borough-Rate Meeting.~--In 1874 the Town Council asked for power  to lay a Borough-rate exceeding 2s. in the L., but after three days'  polling (ending March 30) permission was refused by a majority of 2,654  votes. The power was obtained afterwards.    ~Anti-Church-Rate Meetings~ were frequent enough at one period of our  history. The two most worthy of remembrance were those of Dec. 15, 1834,  when the rate was refused by a majority of 4,966 votes, and Oct., 1841,  when the polling showed 626 for the rate and 7,281 against.    ~Anti-Corn-Law Meetings~ were also numerous. The one to recollect is  that held Feb. 18, 1842.    ~Anti-Papal Demonstration.~--A town's meeting took place in the Town  Hall, Dec. 11, 1850, to protest against the assumption of ecclesiastical  titles by the Catholic hierarchy. About 8,000 persons were present, and  the \"No Popery\" element was strong, but Joseph Sturge moved an amendment  for freedom to all parties, which so split the votes that the Mayor said  the amendment was not carried and the resolution was lost.    ~Anti-Slavery.~--The first Anti-Slavery meeting held here was that of  Nov. 27, 1787. A local petition to Parliament against the slave trade  was presented to the House of Commons, Feb. 11, 1788. A local society  was formed here in 1826, Joseph Sturge being secretary, and many  meetings were held before the Day of Abolition was celebrated. The most  noteworthy of these was that at Dee's Assembly Room, April 16, 1833,  when G.F. Muntz and the Political Union opposed the agitation; a great  meeting, Oct. 14, 1835; another on Feb. 1, 1836, in which Daniel  O'Connell and John Angell James took part. This last was the first large  town's meeting at which the \"total and immediate\" abolition of slavery  was demanded. Joseph Sturge following it up by going to the West Indies  and reporting the hardships inflicted upon the blacks under the  \"gradual\" system then in operation. Aug. 7, 1838, the day when slavery  dropped its chains on English ground, was celebrated here by a  children's festival in the Town Hall, by laying the foundation-stone of  \"The Negro Emancipation Schools,\" Legge Street, and by a public meeting  at night, at which Sir Eardley Wilmott, D. O'Connell, Dr. Lushington,  Edward Baines, &c., were present.    ~Anti-one-thing-or-t'other.~--True to their motto, Birmingham people are  always ready to oppose the wrong and forward the right, but what is  right and what wrong is only to be ascertained by public discussion, and  a few dates of celebrated \"talks\" are here given:--    In 1719 the apprenticing of Russian youths to local trades was objected  to.    In the Christmas week of 1754 public protest was made against the tax on  wheel carriages.    March 12, 1824, a deputation was sent to Parliament to protest against  our workmen being allowed to emigrate, for fear they should teach the  foreigners.    A proposed New Improvement Bill was vetoed by the burgesses, Dec. 18,  1855. We _have_ improved a little since then!    An Anti-Confessional meeting was held Nov. 8, 1877.    An Anti-Contagious Diseases Act meeting, April 19, 1877.    An Anti-giving-up-Fugitive-Slave meeting, Jan. 1, 1876, when a certain  Admiralty Circular was condemned.    An Anti-Irish-Church-Establishment meeting was held June 14, 1869.    An Anti-moving-the-Cattle Market meeting Dec. 14, 1869, Smithfield being  preferred to Duddeston Hall.    An Anti-Railway-through-Sutton-Park meeting, April 15, 1872, but the  railway _is_ there.    An Anti-Rotten-Ship-and-Sailor-drowning meeting, with Mr. Plimsoll to  the fore, May 14 1873. Another July 29, 1875.    An Anti-Ashantee War meeting Sept. 29, 1873.    An Anti-Turkish Atrocity meeting, Sept. 7, 1876; followed by one on Oct.  2nd, properly settling the Eastern question.    An Anti-Six-Million-War-Vote meeting was held on Jan. 28, 1878, when the  Liberal majority was immense. A Tory opposition meeting, in support of  the vote, was held Feb. 12, when chairs and forms were broken up to use  as arguments, the result being a majority of 2 to 1 for both sides.    An Anti-War meeting, May 3, 1878.    Anti-Vivisection meetings. April 24, 1877, and May 6, 1878.    ~Apollo, Moseley Street.~--Opened as a public resort in 1786, the Rea  being then a clear running brook. The first tenant did not prosper, for  in the first week of March, 1787, the _Gazette_ contained an  advertisement that the Apollo Hotel, \"pleasantly situate in a new  street, called Moseley Street, in the hamlet of Deritend, on the banks  of the River Rea,\" with \"a spacious Bowling Green and Gardens,\" was to  be let, with or without four acres of good pasture land. When closed as  a licensed house, it was at first divided into two residences, but in  1816 the division walls, &c., were removed, to fit it as a residence for  Mr. Hamper, the antiquary. That gentleman wrote that the prospect at the  back was delightful, and was bounded only by Bromsgrove Lickey. The  building was then called \"Deritend House.\"    ~Aquariums.~--The Aquarium at Aston Lower Grounds was opened July 10,  1879. The principal room has a length of 312 feet, the promenade being  24 feet wide by 20 feet high. The west side of this spacious apartment  is fitted with a number of large show tanks, where many rare and choice  specimens of marine animals and fishes may be exhibited. On a smaller  scale there is an Aquarium at the \"Crystal Palace\" Garden, at Sutton  Coldfield, and a curiosity in the shape of an \"Aquarium Bar\" may be seen  at the establishment of Mr. Bailey, in Moor Street.    ~Arcades.~--The Arcade between Monmouth Street and Temple Row, was  commenced April 26, 1875; first illuminated August 19, 1876, and opened  for public use on 28th"]]]
