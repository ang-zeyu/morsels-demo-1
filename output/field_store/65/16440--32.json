The reader will now have the kindness to consider Mr. Sponge arriving at  Scampley.    'Ah, Mr. Sponge!' exclaimed Mr. Buckram, who, having seen our friend  advancing up the little twisting approach from the road to his house  through a little square window almost blinded with Irish ivy, out of which  he was in the habit of contemplating the arrival of his occasional lodgers,  Doe and Roe. 'Ah, Mr. Sponge!' exclaimed he, with well-assumed gaiety; 'you  should have been here yesterday; sent away two sich osses--perfect  'unters--the werry best I do think I ever saw in my life; either would have  bin the werry oss for your money. But come in, Mr. Sponge, sir, come in,'  continued he, backing himself through a little sentry-box of a green  portico, to a narrow passage which branched off into little rooms on either  side.    As Buckram made this retrograde movement, he gave a gentle pull to the  wooden handle of an old-fashioned wire bell-pull in the midst of buggy,  four-in-hand, and other whips, hanging in the entrance, a touch that was  acknowledged by a single tinkle of the bell in the stable-yard.    They then entered the little room on the right, whose walls were decorated  with various sporting prints chiefly illustrative of steeple-chases, with  here and there a stunted fox-brush, tossing about as a duster. The  ill-ventilated room reeked with the effluvia of stale smoke, and the faded  green baize of a little round table in the centre was covered with  filbert-shells and empty ale-glasses. The whole furniture of the room  wasn't worth five pounds.    Mr. Sponge, being now on the dealing tack, commenced in the  poverty-stricken strain adapted to the occasion. Having deposited his hat  on the floor, taken his left leg up to nurse, and given his hair a backward  rub with his right hand, he thus commenced:    'Now, Buckram,' said he, 'I'll tell you how it is. I'm deuced  hard-up--regularly in Short's Gardens. I lost eighteen 'undred on the  Derby, and seven on the Leger, the best part of my year's income, indeed;  and I just want to hire two or three horses for the season, with the option  of buying, if I like; and if you supply me well, I may be the means of  bringing grist to your mill; you twig, eh?'    'Well, Mr. Sponge,' replied Buckram, sliding several consecutive  half-crowns down the incline plane of his pocket. 'Well, Mr. Sponge, I  shall be happy to do my best for you. I wish you'd come yesterday, though,  as I said before, I jest had two of the neatest nags--a bay and a grey--not  that colour makes any matter to a judge like you; there's no sounder sayin'  than that a good oss is not never of a bad colour; only to a young gemman,  you know, it's well to have 'em smart, and the ticket, in short;  howsomever, I must do the best I can for you, and if there's nothin' in  that tickles your fancy, why, you must give me a few days to see if I can  arrange an exchange with some other gent; but the present is like to be a  werry haggiwatin' season; had more happlications for osses nor ever I  remembers, and I've been a dealer now, man and boy, turned of  eight-and-thirty years; but young gents is whimsical, and it was a young  'un wot got these, and there's no sayin' but he mayn't like them--indeed,  one's rayther difficult to ride--that's to say, the grey, the neatest of  the two, and he _may_ come back, and if so, you shall have him; and a  safer, sweeter oss was never seen, or one more like to do credit to a gent:  but you knows what an oss is, Mr. Sponge, and can do justice to me, and I  should like to put summut good into your hands--_that_ I should.'    With conversation, or rather with balderdash, such as this, Mr. Buckram  beguiled the few minutes necessary for removing the bandages, hiding the  bottles, and stirring up the cripples about to be examined, and the heavy  flap of the coach-house door announcing that all was ready, he forthwith  led the way through a door in a brick wall into a little three-sides of a  square yard, formed of stables and loose boxes, with a dilapidated  dove-cote above a pump in the centre; Mr. Buckram, not growing corn, could  afford to keep pigeons.          CHAPTER III    PETER LEATHER      Nothing bespeaks the character of a dealer's trade more than the servants  and hangers-on of the establishment. The civiler in manner, and the better  they are 'put on,' the higher the standing of the master, and the better  the stamp of the horses.    Those about Mr. Buckram's were of a very shady order. Dirty-shirted,  sloggering, baggy-breeched, slangey-gaitered fellows, with the word 'gin'  indelibly imprinted on their faces. Peter Leather, the head man, was one of  the fallen angels of servitude. He had once driven a duke--the Duke of  Dazzleton--having nothing whatever to do but dress himself and climb into  his well-indented richly fringed throne, with a helper at each horse's head  to 'let go' at a nod from his broad laced three-cornered hat. Then having  got in his cargo (or rubbish, as he used to call them), he would start off  at a pace that was truly terrific, cutting out this vehicle, shooting past  that, all but grazing a third, anathematizing the 'buses, and abusing the  draymen. We don't know how he might be with the queen, but he certainly  drove as though he thought nobody had any business in the street while the  Duchess of Dazzleton wanted it. The duchess liked going fast, and Peter  accommodated her. The duke jobbed his horses and didn't care about pace,  and so things might have gone on very comfortably, if Peter one afternoon  hadn't run his pole into the panel of a very plain but very neat yellow  barouche, passing the end of New Bond Street, which having nothing but a  simple crest--a stag's head on the panel--made him think it belonged to  some bulky cit, taking the air with his rib, but who, unfortunately, turned  out to be no less a person than Sir Giles Nabem, Knight, the great police  magistrate, upon one of whose myrmidons in plain clothes, who came to the  rescue, Peter committed a most violent assault, for which unlucky casualty  his worship furnished him with rotatory occupation for his fat calves in  the 'H. of C.,' as the clerk shortly designated the House of Correction.  Thither Peter went, and in lieu of his lace-bedaubed coat, gold-gartered  plushes, stockings, and buckled shoes, he was dressed up in a suit of  tight-fitting yellow and black-striped worsteds, that gave him the  appearance of a wasp without wings. Peter Leather then tumbled regularly  down the staircase of servitude, the greatness of his fall being  occasionally broken by landing in some inferior place. From the Duke of  Dazzleton's, or rather from the tread-mill, he went to the Marquis of  Mammon, whom he very soon left because he wouldn't wear a second-hand wig.  From the marquis he got hired to the great Irish Earl of Coarsegab, who  expected him to wash the carriage, wait at table, and do other incidentals  never contemplated by a London coachman. Peter threw this place up with  indignation on being told to take the letters to the post. He then lived on  his 'means' for a while, a thing that is much finer in theory than in  practice, and having about exhausted his substance and placed the bulk of  his apparel in safe keeping, he condescended to take a place as job  coachman in a livery-stable--a 'horses let by the hour, day, or month'  one, in which he enacted as many characters, at least made as many  different appearances, as the late Mr. Mathews used to do in his celebrated  'At Homes.' One day Peter would be seen ducking under the mews' entrance in  one of those greasy, painfully well-brushed hats, the certain precursors of  soiled linen and seedy, most seedy-covered buttoned coats, that would  puzzle a conjuror to say whether they were black, or grey, or olive, or  invisible green turned visible brown. Then another day he might be seen in  old Mrs. Gadabout's sky-blue livery, with a tarnished, gold-laced hat,  nodding over his nose; and on a third he would shine forth in Mrs.  Major-General Flareup's cockaded one, with a worsted shoulder-knot, and a  much over-daubed light drab livery coat, with crimson inexpressibles, so  tight as to astonish a beholder how he ever got into them. Humiliation,  however, has its limits as well as other things; and Peter having been  invited to descend from his box--alas! a regular country patent leather  one, and invest himself in a Quaker-collared blue coat, with a red vest,  and a pair of blue trousers with a broad red stripe down the sides, to  drive the Honourable old Miss Wrinkleton, of Harley Street, to Court in a  'one oss pianoforte-case,' as he called a Clarence, he could stand it no  longer, and, chucking the nether garments into the fire, he rushed  frantically up the area-steps, mounted his box, and quilted the old  crocodile of a horse all the way home, accompanying each cut with an  imprecation such as '_me_ make a guy of myself!' (whip) '_me_ put on sich  things!' (whip, whip) '_me_ drive down Sin Jimses-street!' (whip, whip,  whip), '_I'd_ see her ---- fust!' (whip, whip, whip), cutting at the old  horse just as if he was laying it into Miss Wrinkleton, so that by the time  he got home he had established a considerable lather on the old nag, which  his master resenting a row ensued, the sequel of which may readily be  imagined. After assisting Mrs. Clearstarch, the Kilburn laundress, in  getting in and taking out her washing, for a few weeks, chance at last  landed him at Mr. Benjamin Buckram's, from whence he is now about to be  removed to become our hero Mr. Sponge's Sancho Panza, in his fox-hunting,  fortune-hunting career, and disseminate in remote parts his doctrines of  the real honour and dignity of servitude."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#3)"],[1,"o., San Francisco_    \"THE NATIONS OF THE WEST\"]          HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES          PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD          CHAPTER I    THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA      The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America  during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in  the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the  earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,  westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into  Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported  by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the  narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to  the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the  Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the  beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires  the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only  one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the  institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.    In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed  from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them  affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the  altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to  America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother  country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set  up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also  political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.      THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION    It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of  water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the  seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays  of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain  the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.  Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk  the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and  mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,  adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an  enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or  gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to  assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy  proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was  the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the  beginning.    =The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an  instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which  had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.  Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of  society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a  particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in  the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it  received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from  the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and  control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the  corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its  affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in  fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the  corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,  they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the  seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,  they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The  stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the  chief magistrate.    [Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY  COMPANY]    Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the  trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,  in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia  at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,  chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New  Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts  were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated  in 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts  Bay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group  drawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\"  wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the  south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company  in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it  was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the  rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.    In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company  colonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,  James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned  for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George  II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including  himself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees  for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of  their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not  differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and  colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions  had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.    =The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in  the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or  congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common  religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this  institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a  potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far  away from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one  heart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at  Jerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of  the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all  care of each other's good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a  leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in  1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a  written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to  the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until  Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.    [Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]    Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve  of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the  congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New  Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by  small bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the  Lord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a  year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers  to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of  incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation  of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River  Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own  (1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the  towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts  were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.    Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of  the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government  and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The  towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily  under their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had  the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental  Articles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut  shore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a  perfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"    =The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the  proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word  \"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king  granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy  for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down  to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and  powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the  ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found  and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor  worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the  common undertaking.    Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,  owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor  in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,  established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and  blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under  the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American  union.
