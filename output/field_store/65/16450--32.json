I told him that I was  very much his servant, but that I could not give myself license to  undertake the voyage without the commands of the king, to whom I was  bound, as well by birth as by the pension with which His Majesty  honoured me to enable me to maintain myself near his person, but that,  if it should please him to speak to the king about it, and give me his  commands, that it should be very agreeable to me, which he promised and  did, and received the king's orders for me to make the voyage and make a  faithful report thereof; and for that purpose M. de Gesvres, secretary  of his commandments, sent me with a letter to the said Du Pont-Grave,  desiring him to take me in his ship and enable me to see and examine  what could be done in the country, giving me every possible assistance.\"    \"_Me voila expedie_,\" says Champlain, \"I leave Paris and take passage on  Pont-Grave's ship in the year 1603, the 15th of the month of March.\" The  voyage was favourable for the first fifteen days, but on the 30th a  heavy storm arose, \"more thunder than wind,\" which lasted until April  16th. On May 6th the vessel approached Newfoundland, and arrived at  Tadousac[3] on the 24th. Here they met with about one hundred Indians,  under the command of Anadabijou, who were rejoicing on account of their  recent victory over the Iroquois. The chief made a long harangue,  speaking slowly. He congratulated himself upon his friendship with the  French nation, and stated that he was happy to learn that the king was  anxious to send some of his subjects to reside in the country and to  assist them in their wars. Champlain was also informed that the  Etchemins, the Algonquins, and the Montagnais, to the number of about  one thousand, had lately been engaged in warfare with the Iroquois, whom  they had vanquished with the loss of one hundred men.    On June 9th following, Champlain witnessed the spectacle of a grand  feast given by the Indians in commemoration of their victory. The  celebration consisted of dances, songs, speeches and games. Tessoueat,  the _sagamo_ of the Ottawas, was the chief captain, and took a prominent  part in the demonstration.    After a long description of these public festivities, Champlain gives  ample details of the manners and customs of the Indians, especially of  their superstitions. The Indians believed that a God existed who was the  creator of all things, but they had a curious manner of explaining the  creation of man. \"When God had made everything,\" they said, \"He took a  quantity of arrows and fixed them in the earth, whence came men and  women, who have increased ever since.\" The _sagamo_ said they believed  in the existence of a God, a son, a mother and a sun; that God was the  greatest of the four; that the son and the sun were both good; that the  mother was a lesser person, and so was the father, who was less bad.    The Indians were convinced that their deity had held communication with  their ancestors. One day five Indians ran towards the setting sun where  they met God, who asked them, \"Where are you going?\" \"We are going to  seek our life,\" they replied. Then God said, \"You will find it here.\"  But they did not hear the divine word, and went away. Then God took a  stone and touched two of them, and they were immediately turned into  stones. Addressing the three other Indians, God asked the same question,  \"Where are you going?\" and He was given the same answer. \"Do not go  further,\" said the divine voice, \"you will find your life here.\" Seeing  nothing, however, they continued their journey. Then God took two sticks  and touched two of them, and they were at once turned into sticks. The  fifth Indian, however, paused, and God gave him some meat, which he ate,  and he afterwards returned to his countrymen.    These Indian tribes had their jugglers, whom they called _pilotois_,  from the Basques, or _autmoins_, which means a magician. These jugglers  exercised great sway over the Indians, who would not hesitate to kill a  Frenchman if the jugglers decided that it was necessary.    In spite of their superstitions Champlain believed that it would be an  easy task to convert the Indians to Christianity, especially if the  French resided near them. This desirable end was not to be attained  without great difficulty, as Champlain soon realized, for the  missionaries toiled for many years before their efforts were crowned  with success.    Champlain now proceeded to explore the river Saguenay for a distance of  twelve to fifteen leagues, and he thus describes the scenery:--    \"All the land I have seen is composed of rocks, covered with fir woods,  cypress, birch, very unpleasing land, where I could not find a league of  plain land on each side.\" He also learned from the Indians of the  existence of Lake St. John, and of a salt sea flowing towards the north.  It was evidently Hudson Bay to which these northern tribes directed  Champlain's attention, and if they had not seen it themselves they had  probably heard of its existence from the Indians dwelling around the  southern or south-western shores of the bay, who came annually to  Nemiscau Lake to trade their furs. This lake was half way between Hudson  Bay and the river St. Lawrence. The Kilistinons and other Indians of the  north had regular communication with their _congeneres_ scattered along  the shores of the St. Maurice and the several rivers which flow into  Lake St. John.    When the French arrived in Canada with Chauvin, in the year 1600, they  began to monopolize the fur trade of all the Indian nations, but some  years later the English established themselves on the shores of Hudson  Bay, and prosecuted the trade for their own benefit.    Champlain could not, evidently, have been in possession of any exact  information as to the existence of this large bay, as he was searching  for a northern passage to Cathay, the great _desideratum_ of all the  navigators and explorers of the time.    After having promised to aid the various tribes gathered at Tadousac in  their wars, Champlain and Pont-Grave proceeded to Sault St. Louis. This  expedition lasted fifteen days, during which they saw Hare Island, so  named by Jacques Cartier, and the Island of Orleans. The ship anchored  at Quebec where Champlain stopped to make a short description of the  country watered by the St. Lawrence, and they then proceeded to Sault  St. Louis. Here Champlain gathered much valuable information relating to  lakes Ontario and Erie, the Detroit River, Niagara Falls, and the rapids  of the St. Lawrence. Returning to Tadousac, he determined to explore  Gaspesia, and proceeded to visit Perce and Mal Bay, where he met Indians  at every turn. He also was informed by Prevert, from St. Malo, who was  exploring the country, of the existence of a copper mine.    Champlain carefully noted all the information he had received, and after  his return to Tadousac he sailed again for France on August 16th, 1603,  and reached Havre de Grace, after a passage of twenty-one days. On his  arrival in France, he heard that Aymar de Chastes had died a few weeks  previously, on August 13th. This was a great loss to Canada, and  especially to Champlain, for he was convinced that the noble and  enterprising de Chastes was seriously disposed to colonize New France.  \"In this enterprise,\" he says, \"I cannot find a single fault, because it  has been well inaugurated.\" With the death of de Chastes, the project of  colonizing would undoubtedly have fallen through had not Champlain been  present to promote another movement in this direction. Champlain had an  interview with the king, and presented him with a map of the country  which he had visited, and placed in his hands a relation of his  voyage.[4] Henry IV was so favourably impressed that he promised to  assist Champlain in his patriotic designs.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] This island is only forty leagues in length and twenty in breadth,  and belonged to the Spanish from the date of its discovery by Ponce de  Leon in 1509, to 1598. When Champlain visited the island it had been  taken by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland. During the same year Sir  John Berkeley commanded, but being unable to remain there, he deserted  the place, and joined Clifford near the Azores, when both went to  England, having lost about seven hundred men during their expedition.

The Hakluyt Society had it translated in 1859, and  published at London. In 1870 the Reverend Laverdiere, librarian of the  Laval University, of Quebec, had it printed in French, with the designs,  coloured for the most part, with the complete works of Champlain.

V      \"Yes,\" said Walkham, the sculptor, \"it's a most curious thing.\"    \"What is?\" asked Ernest, who had been dreaming over the Sphinx that was  looking at him from its corner with the sarcastic smile of five thousand  years.    \"How our dreams of yesterday stare at us like strangers to-day.\"    \"On the contrary,\" remarked Reginald, \"it would be strange if they were  still to know us. In fact, it would be unnatural. The skies above us and  the earth underfoot are in perpetual motion. Each atom of our physical  nature is vibrating with unimaginable rapidity. Change is identical with  life.\"    \"It sometimes seems,\" said the sculptor, \"as if thoughts evaporated like  water.\"    \"Why not, under favorable conditions?\"    \"But where do they go? Surely they cannot perish utterly?\"    \"Yes, that is the question. Or, rather, it is not a question. Nothing  is ever lost in the spiritual universe.\"    \"But what,\" inquired Ernest, \"is the particular reason for your  reflection?\"    \"It is this,\" the sculptor replied; \"I had a striking motive and lost  it.\"    \"Do you remember,\" he continued, speaking to Reginald, \"the Narcissus I  was working on the last time when you called at my studio?\"    \"Yes; it was a striking thing and impressed me very much, though I  cannot recall it at the moment.\"    \"Well, it was a commission. An eccentric young millionaire had offered  me eight thousand dollars for it. I had an absolutely original  conception. But I cannot execute it. It's as if a breeze had carried it  away.\"    \"That is very regrettable.\"    \"Well, I should say so,\" replied the sculptor.    Ernest smiled. For everybody knew of Walkham's domestic troubles. Having  twice figured in the divorce court, he was at present defraying the  expenses of three households.    The sculptor had meanwhile seated himself at Reginald's writing-table,  unintentionally scanning a typewritten page that was lying before him.  Like all artists, something of a madman and something of a child, he at  first glanced over its contents distractedly, then with an interest so  intense that he was no longer aware of the impropriety of his action.    \"By Jove!\" he cried. \"What is this?\"    \"It's an epic of the French Revolution,\" Reginald replied, not without  surprise.    \"But, man, do you know that I have discovered my motive in it?\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Ernest, looking first at Reginald and then at  Walkham, whose sanity he began to doubt.    \"Listen!\"    And the sculptor read, trembling with emotion, a long passage whose  measured cadence delighted Ernest's ear, without, however, enlightening  his mind as to the purport of Walkham's cryptic remark.    Reginald said nothing, but the gleam in his eye showed that this time,  at least, his interest was alert.    Walkham saw the hopelessness of making clear his meaning without an  explanation.    \"I forget you haven't a sculptor's mind. I am so constituted that, with  me, all impressions are immediately translated into the sense of form. I  do not hear music; I see it rise with domes and spires, with painted  windows and Arabesques. The scent of the rose is to me tangible. I can  almost feel it with my hand. So your prose suggested to me, by its  rhythmic flow, something which, at first indefinite, crystallised  finally into my lost conception of Narcissus.\"    \"It is extraordinary,\" murmured Reginald. \"I had not dreamed of it.\"    \"So you do not think it rather fantastic?\" remarked Ernest,  circumscribing his true meaning.    \"No, it is quite possible. Perhaps his Narcissus was engaging the  sub-conscious strata of my mind while I was writing this passage. And  surely it would be strange if the undercurrents of our mind were not  reflected in our style.\"    \"Do you mean, then, that a subtle psychologist ought to be able to read  beneath and between our lines, not only what we express, but also what  we leave unexpressed?\"    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"Even if, while we are writing, we are unconscious of our state of mind?  That would open a new field to psychology.\"    \"Only to those that have the key, that can read the hidden symbols. It  is to me a matter-of-course that every mind-movement below or above the  threshold of consciousness must, of a necessity, leave its imprint  faintly or clearly, as the case may be, upon our activities.\"    \"This may explain why books that seem intolerably dull to the majority,  delight the hearts of the few,\" Ernest interjected.    \"Yes, to the few that possess the key. I distinctly remember how an  uncle of mine once laid down a discussion on higher mathematics and  blushed fearfully when his innocent wife looked over his shoulder. The  man who had written it was a roue.\"    \"Then the seemingly most harmless books may secretly possess the power  of scattering in young minds the seed of corruption,\" Walkham remarked.    \"If they happen to understand,\" Clarke observed thoughtfully. \"I can  very well conceive of a lecherous text-book of the calculus, or of a  reporter's story of a picnic in which burnt, under the surface,  undiscoverable, save to the initiate, the tragic passion of Tristram and  Iseult.\"          VI      Several weeks had elapsed since the conversation in Reginald Clarke's  studio. The spring was now well advanced and had sprinkled the meadows  with flowers, and the bookshelves of the reviewers with fiction. The  latter Ernest turned to good account, but from the flowers no poem  blossomed forth. In writing about other men's books, he almost forgot  that the springtide had brought to him no bouquet of song. Only now and  then, like a rippling of water, disquietude troubled his soul.    The strange personality of the master of the house had enveloped the  lad's thoughts with an impenetrable maze. The day before Jack had come  on a flying visit from Harvard, but even he was unable to free Ernest's  soul from the obsession of Reginald Clarke.    Ernest was lazily stretching himself on a couch, waving the smoke of  his cigarette to Reginald, who was writing at his desk.    \"Your friend Jack is delightful,\" Reginald remarked, looking up from his  papers. \"And his ebon-coloured hair contrasts prettily with the gold in  yours. I should imagine that you are temperamental antipodes.\"    \"So we are; but friendship bridges the chasm between.\"    \"How long have you known him?\"    \"We have been chums ever since our sophomore year.\"    \"What attracted you in him?\"    \"It is no simple matter to define exactly one's likes and dislikes. Even  a tiny protoplasmic animal appears to be highly complex under the  microscope. How can we hope to analyse, with any degree of certitude,  our souls, especially when, under the influence of feeling, we see as  through a glass darkly.\"    \"It is true that personal feeling colours our spectacles and distorts  the perspective. Still, we should not shrink from self-analysis. We must  learn to see clearly into our own hearts if we would give vitality to  our work. Indiscretion is the better part of literature, and it  behooves us to hound down each delicate elusive shadow of emotion, and  convert it into copy.\"    \"It is because I am so self-analytical that I realise the complexity of  my nature, and am at a loss to define my emotions. Conflicting forces  sway us hither and thither without neutralising each other. Physicology  isn't physics. There were many things to attract me to Jack. He was  subtler, more sympathetic, more feminine, perhaps, than the rest of my  college-mates.\"    \"That I have noticed. In fact, his lashes are those of a girl. You still  care for him very much?\"    \"It isn't a matter of caring. We are two beings that live one life.\"    \"A sort of psychic Siamese twins?\"    \"Almost. Why, the matter is very simple. Our hearts root in the same  soil; the same books have nourished us, the same great winds have shaken  our being, and the same sunshine called forth the beautiful blossom of  friendship.\"    \"He struck me, if you will pardon my saying so, as a rather commonplace  companion.\"    \"There is in him a hidden sweetness, and a depth of feeling which only  intimate contact reveals. He is now taking his post-graduate course at  Harvard, and for well-nigh two months we have not met; yet so many  invisible threads of common experience unite us that we could meet after  years and still be near each other.\"    \"You are very young,\" Reginald replied.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Ah--never mind.\"    \"So you do not believe that two hearts may ever beat as one?\"    \"No, that is an auditory delusion. Not even two clocks beat in unison.  There is always a discrepancy, infinitesimal, perhaps, but a discrepancy  nevertheless.\"    A sharp ring of the bell interrupted the conversation. A moment later a  curly head peeped through the door.    \"Hello, Ernest! How are you, old man?\" the intruder cried, with a laugh  in his voice. Then, noticing Clarke, he shook hands with the great man  unceremoniously, with the nonchalance of the healthy young animal bred  in the atmosphere of an American college.    His touch seemed to thrill Clarke, who breathed heavily and then stepped  to the window, as if to conceal the flush of vitality on his cheek.    It was a breath of springtide that Jack had brought with him. Youth is a  Prince Charming. To shrivelled veins the pressure of his hand imparts a  spark of animation, and middle age unfolds its petals in his presence,  as a sunflower gazing at late noon once more upon its lord.    \"I have come to take Ernest away from you,\" said Jack. \"He looks a  trifle paler than usual, and a day's outing will stir the red corpuscles  in his blood.\"    \"I have no doubt that you will take very good care of him,\" Reginald  replied.    \"Where shall we go?\" Ernest asked, absent-mindedly.    But he did not hear the answer, for Reginald's scepticisms had more  deeply impressed him than he cared to confess to himself.          VII      The two boys had bathed their souls"]]]
