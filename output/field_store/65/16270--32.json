When war is duly declared, it is not merely a war between one  government and another, but between nation and nation, between every  individual of the one state with each and every individual of the  other. The subjects of one country are all, and every one of them, the  foes of every subject of the other, and from this principle flow many  important consequences.[8]    [Sidenote: Property of Subjects of Belligerent States in the Enemy's  Country.]    On the commencement of hostilities a natural expectation will arise  that the Property, (if not the Persons) of the Belligerent State,  found in the Enemy's Territory, will become liable to seizure and  confiscation, especially as no declaration or notice of war is now  necessary to legalize hostilities. According to strict authority, the  Persons and Property of Subjects of the Enemy found in the belligerent  state are liable to detention and confiscation; but even on this point  diversity of opinion has arisen among institutional writers; and  modern usage seems to exempt the Persons and Property of the Enemy  found in either territory at the outbreak of the war, from its  operations.    Without entering on the long arguments that have been produced on this  subject, and which it is not the intention of this treatise to  reproduce, the rule may be stated very nearly as follows.[9]    That though, on principle, the property of the enemy is liable to  seizure and confiscation, yet it is now an established international  usage that such property found within the territory of the belligerent  state, or debts due to its subjects by the government or individuals,  _at the commencement_ of hostilities, are not liable to be seized and  confiscated as prize of war.    This rule is often enforced by treaty, but unless thus enforced it  cannot be considered as an inflexible, though established, rule. This  rule is a guide which the Sovran of the belligerent state follows or  abandons at will, and although it cannot be disregarded by him without  obloquy, yet it may be disregarded. It is not an immutable rule, but  depends on considerations which continually vary.[10]    [Sidenote: Rule with respect to Immoveable Property.]    The rule is different with respect to Immoveable Things, such as  Landed Estates. He who declares war does not confiscate the Immoveable  Estate possessed in his country by the enemy, but the Income may be  sequestrated, to prevent its being remitted to the enemy.[11]    [Sidenote: Public Funds.]    Public Funds, or in other words, debts due from the Sovran of the  hostile state to Private Persons, are always held protected from  confiscation, and there is only one instance in modern times where  this rule has been broken. It is a matter of public faith; and even  during war, no enquiry ought to be made whether any part of the public  debt is due to the subjects of the enemy.[12]    [Sidenote: Rule of Reciprocity.]    All these rules are, however, subject to the Rule of Reciprocity. This  is thus laid down by Sir William Scott, in the case of the Santa Cruz,         \"that at the commencement of a war, it is the constant       practice of this country to condemn property seized before       the war, if the enemy condemns, and to restore if the enemy       restores. It is a principle sanctioned by that great       foundation of the Law of England, _Magna Charta_ itself,       which prescribes, that at the commencement of a war the       enemy's merchants shall be kept and treated as our own       merchants are treated in their country.\"[13]    [Sidenote: Droits of Admiralty.]    [14]In England, at present, however, these liberal principles are  modified by Rights of Admiralty, the foregoing rules being applied  rather to property _upon the land_ than _within the territory_; for  although, when captures are made in ports, havens, or rivers, within  the body of the country of the realm, the Admiralty is in reality  excluded, yet Prize Courts have uniformly, without objection, tried  all such captures in ports and havens within the realm; as in the case  of ships not knowing hostilities, coming in by mistake, before the  declaration of war or hostilities; all the ships of the enemy are  detained in our ports, to be confiscated as the property of the enemy,  if no reciprocal agreement is made.[15]    [Sidenote: Hostile Embargo.]    This species of reprisal is termed a Hostile Embargo. It cannot well  be distinguished from the practice of seizing property found within  the territory upon the declaration of war. It is undoubtedly against  the spirit of modern liberality, and has been but too justly  reprobated as destroying that protection to property which the rule of  faith and justice gives it, when brought into the country in the  course of trade, and in the confidence of peace.    It is not, however, as Wheaton states, peculiar to England, but common  to modern Europe, except that England does not, in practice, appear to  be influenced by the corresponding conduct of the enemy in that  respect.[16]    [Sidenote: Debts Due to and from an Enemy.]    But with relation to Debts Due to an Enemy, previous to hostilities,  English law follows a wiser principle.    On the outbreak of war between Denmark and this country in 1807, the  Danish Government, as a measure of retaliation for the seizure of  their ships in our ports, issued an ordinance sequestrating all debts  due from Danish to British subjects, causing them to be paid into the  Danish Royal Treasury.    The Court of King's Bench decided that this was not a legal defence to  a suit in England for the debt, and that the ordinance was not  conformable to the Law to Nations.[17] It was observed by the Court,  that the right of confiscating debts (contended for on the authority  of Vattel,)[18] was not recognised by Grotius,[19] and was impugned by  Puffendorf and others; and that no instance had occurred of the  exercise of the right, (except the ordinance in question,) for upwards  of a century. This is undoubtedly the law in England, although it may  be doubted if this rule still holds so strongly in the United States.    [Sidenote: Interruption of Intercourse; Trading with the Enemy  unlawful.]    One of the most immediate consequences of the outbreak of hostilities  is the complete interruption of Commercial Intercourse between the  subjects of the countries at war, even to the extent of holding it  unlawful, after war has begun, except under special licence of the  government, to send a vessel to the enemy's country to bring home,  with _their permission_, one's own property, when war has broken out.    There cannot exist at the same time a war for arms and a peace for  commerce; from the very nature of war all commercial intercourse  ceases between enemies. This interdiction of intercourse is the result  of the mere operation of war; for declarations of war generally enjoin  on every subject the duty of attack on the subjects of the hostile  state, of seizing their goods, and doing them every harm in their  power.[20]    From the very nature of war itself, all commercial intercourse ceases  between enemies. The utility, however, of merchants, and the mutual  wants of nations, have almost got the better of the law of war as to  commerce. Hence, commerce is alternately permitted and forbidden in  time of war, as princes think it most for the interest of their  subjects. A commercial nation is anxious to trade, and accommodate the  laws of war to the greater or lesser want that it may have for the  goods of the other. Thus sometimes a mutual commerce is permitted  generally; sometimes as to certain merchandizes only, while others are  prohibited; and sometimes it is prohibited altogether. In this manner  there is partly peace and partly war, between subjects of both  countries.[21]    In the case of the Hoop,[22] Sir Wm. Scott says,         \"By the law and constitution of Great Britain, the Sovereign       alone has the power of declaring War and Peace. He alone,       therefore, who has the power of entirely removing the state       of war, has the power of removing it in part, by permitting,       when he sees proper, that commercial intercourse, which is a       partial suspension of the war. There may be occasions on       which such an intercourse may be highly expedient; but it is       not for individuals to determine on the expediency of such       occasions, on their own notions of commerce only, and       possibly on grounds of private advantage not very       reconcilable with the general interests of the state. It is       for the state alone, on more enlarged views of policy, and       of all circumstances that may be connected with such an       intercourse, to determine when it shall be permitted, and       under what regulations. No principle ought to be held more       sacred than that this intercourse cannot subsist on any       other footing than that of the direct permission of the       state. Who can be insensible to the consequences that might       follow, if every person in time of war had a right to carry       on a commercial intercourse with the enemy; and under colour       of that, had the means of carrying on any other species of       intercourse he might think fit? The inconvenience to the       public might be extreme; and where is the inconvenience on       the other side, that the merchants should be compelled, in       such a situation of the two countries, to carry on his trade       between them, (if necessary,) under the eye and control of       the Government charged with the care of public safety?\"    [Sidenote:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#3)"],[1,"one,\" I said.    \"Very. He noted the plain and essential facts, and drew the natural  conclusions from them. But there are some very singular features in this  case; so singular that I am disposed to make a few notes for my own  information.\"    He stooped over the place where the body had lain, and having narrowly  examined the sand there and in the place where the dead man's feet had  rested, drew out his notebook and made a memorandum. He next made a  rapid sketch-plan of the bay, marking the position of the body and the  various impressions in the sand, and then, following the double track  leading from and to the Shepherd's Path, scrutinized the footprints with  the deepest attention, making copious notes and sketches in his book.    \"We may as well go up by the Shepherd's Path,\" said Thorndyke. \"I think  we are equal to the climb, and there may be visible traces of the  murderer after all. The rock is only a sandstone, and not a very hard  one either.\"    We approached the foot of the little rugged track which zigzagged up the  face of the cliff, and, stooping down among the stiff, dry herbage,  examined the surface. Here, at the bottom of the path, where the rock  was softened by the weather, there were several distinct impressions on  the crumbling surface of the murderer's nailed boots, though they were  somewhat confused by the tracks of the sergeant, whose boots were  heavily nailed. But as we ascended the marks became rather less  distinct, and at quite a short distance from the foot of the cliff we  lost them altogether, though we had no difficulty in following the more  recent traces of the sergeant's passage up the path.    When we reached the top of the cliff we paused to scan the path that ran  along its edge, but here, too, although the sergeant's heavy boots had  left quite visible impressions on the ground, there were no signs of any  other feet. At a little distance the sagacious officer himself was  pursuing his investigations, walking backwards and forwards with his  body bent double, and his eyes fixed on the ground.    \"Not a trace of him anywhere,\" said he, straightening himself up as we  approached. \"I was afraid there wouldn't be after all this dry weather.  I shall have to try a different tack. This is a small place, and if  those boots belong to anyone living here they'll be sure to be known.\"    \"The deceased gentleman--Mr. Hearn, I think you called him,\" said  Thorndyke as we turned towards the village--\"is he a native of the  locality?\"    \"Oh no, sir,\" replied the officer. \"He is almost a stranger. He has only  been here about three weeks; but, you know, in a little place like this  a man soon gets to be known--and his business, too, for that matter,\" he  added, with a smile.    \"What was his business, then?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Pleasure, I believe. He was down here for a holiday, though it's a good  way past the season; but, then, he had a friend living here, and that  makes a difference. Mr. Draper up at the Poplars was an old friend of  his, I understand. I am going to call on him now.\"    We walked on along the footpath that led towards the village, but had  only proceeded two or three hundred yards when a loud hail drew our  attention to a man running across a field towards us from the direction  of the cliff.    \"Why, here is Mr. Draper himself,\" exclaimed the sergeant, stopping  short and waving his hand. \"I expect he has heard the news already.\"    Thorndyke and I also halted, and with some curiosity watched the  approach of this new party to the tragedy. As the stranger drew near we  saw that he was a tall, athletic-looking man of about forty, dressed in  a Norfolk knickerbocker suit, and having the appearance of an ordinary  country gentleman, excepting that he carried in his hand, in place of a  walking-stick, the staff of a butterfly-net, the folding ring and bag of  which partly projected from his pocket.    \"Is it true, Sergeant?\" he exclaimed as he came up to us, panting from  his exertions. \"About Mr. Hearn, I mean. There is a rumour that he has  been found dead on the beach.\"    \"It's quite true, sir, I am sorry to say; and, what is worse, he has  been murdered.\"    \"My God! you don't say so!\"    He turned towards us a face that must ordinarily have been jovial  enough, but was now white and scared and, after a brief pause, he  exclaimed:    \"Murdered! Good God! Poor old Hearn! How did it happen, Sergeant? and  when? and is there any clue to the murderer?\"    \"We can't say for certain when it happened,\" replied the sergeant, \"and  as to the question of clues, I was just coming up to call on you.\"    \"On me!\" exclaimed Draper, with a startled glance at the officer. \"What  for?\"    \"Well, we should like to know something about Mr. Hearn--who he was, and  whether he had any enemies, and so forth; anything, in fact, that would  give as a hint where to look for the murderer. And you are the only  person in the place who knew him at all intimately.\"    Mr Draper's pallid face turned a shade paler, and he glanced about him  with an obviously embarrassed air.    \"I'm afraid,\" he began in a hesitating manner, \"I'm afraid I shan't be  able to help you much. I didn't know much about his affairs. You see he  was--well--only a casual acquaintance--\"    \"Well,\" interrupted the sergeant, \"you can tell us who and what he was,  and where he lived, and so forth. We'll find out the rest if you give us  the start.\"    \"I see,\" said Draper. \"Yes, I expect you will.\" His eyes glanced  restlessly to and fro, and he added presently: \"You must come up  to-morrow, and have a talk with me about him, and I'll see what I can  remember.\"    \"I'd rather come this evening,\" said the sergeant firmly.    \"Not this evening,\" pleaded Draper. \"I'm feeling rather--this affair,  you know, has upset me. I couldn't give proper attention--\"    His sentence petered out into a hesitating mumble, and the officer  looked at him in evident surprise at his nervous, embarrassed manner.  His own attitude, however, was perfectly firm, though polite.    \"I don't like pressing you, sir,\" said he, \"but time is precious--we'll  have to go single file here; this pond is a public nuisance. They ought  to bank it up at this end. After you, sir.\"    The pond to which the sergeant alluded had evidently extended at one  time right across the path, but now, thanks to the dry weather, a narrow  isthmus of half-dried mud traversed the morass, and along this Mr.  Draper proceeded to pick his way. The sergeant was about to follow, when  suddenly he stopped short with his eyes riveted upon the muddy track. A  single glance showed me the cause of his surprise, for on the stiff,  putty-like surface, standing out with the sharp distinctness of a wax  mould, were the fresh footprints of the man who had just passed, each  footprint displaying on its sole the impression of stud-nails arranged  in a diamond-shaped pattern, and on its heel a group of similar nails  arranged in a cross.    The sergeant hesitated for only a moment, in which he turned a quick  startled glance upon us; then he followed, walking gingerly along the  edge of the path as if to avoid treading in his predecessor's  footprints. Instinctively we did the same, following closely, and  anxiously awaiting the next development of the tragedy. For a minute or  two we all proceeded in silence, the sergeant being evidently at a loss  how to act, and Mr. Draper busy with his own thoughts. At length the  former spoke.    \"You think, Mr. Draper, you would rather that I looked in on you  to-morrow about this affair?\"    \"Much rather, if you wouldn't mind,\" was the eager reply.    \"Then, in that case,\" said the sergeant, looking at his watch, \"as I've  got a good deal to see to this evening, I'll leave you here, and make my  way to the station.\"    With a farewell flourish of his hand he climbed over a stile, and when,  a few moments later, I caught a glimpse of him through an opening in the  hedge, he was running across the meadow like a hare.    The departure of the police-officer was apparently a great relief to Mr.  Draper, who at once fell back and began to talk with us.    \"You are Dr. Jervis, I think,\" said he. \"I saw you coming out of Dr.  Cooper's house yesterday. We know everything that is happening in the  village, you see.\" He laughed nervously, and added: \"But I don't know  your friend.\"    I introduced Thorndyke, at the mention of whose name our new  acquaintance knitted his brows, and glanced inquisitively at my friend.    \"Thorndyke,\" he repeated; \"the name seems familiar to me. Are you in the  Law, sir?\"    Thorndyke admitted the impeachment, and our companion, having again  bestowed on him a look full of curiosity, continued: \"This horrible  affair will interest you, no doubt, from a professional point of view.  You were present when my poor friend's body was found, I think?\"    \"No,\" replied Thorndyke; \"we came up afterwards, when they were removing  it.\"    Our companion then proceeded to question us about the murder, but  received from Thorndyke only the most general and ambiguous replies. Nor  was there time to go into the matter at length, for the footpath  presently emerged on to the road close to Mr. Draper's house.    \"You will excuse my not asking you in to-night,\" said he, \"but you will  understand that I am not in much form for visitors just now.\"    We assured him that we fully understood, and, having wished him  \"Good-evening,\" pursued our way towards the village.    \"The sergeant is off to get a warrant, I suppose,\" I observed.    \"Yes; and mighty anxious lest his man should be off before he can  execute it. But he is fishing in deeper waters than he thinks, Jervis.  This is a very singular and complicated case; one of the strangest, in  fact, that I have ever met. I shall follow its development with deep  interest.\"    \"The sergeant seems pretty cocksure, all the same,\" I said.    \"He is not to blame for that,\" replied Thorndyke. \"He"]]]
