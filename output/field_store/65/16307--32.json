The Vedic hymns laud the powers of nature and natural  phenomena as personified gods, or even as impersonal phenomena. They  praise also as distinct powers the departed fathers. In the Rig Veda  I. 168, occur some verses in honor of the storm-gods called Maruts:  \"Self-yoked are they come lightly from the sky. The immortals urge  themselves on with the goad. Dustless, born of power, with shining  spears the Maruts overthrow the strongholds. Who is it, O Maruts, ye  that have lightning-spears, that impels you within? ... The streams  roar from the tires, when they send out their cloud-voices,\" etc.  Nothing would seem more justifiable, in view of this hymn and of many  like it, than to assume with Mueller and other Indologians, that the  Marut-gods are personifications of natural phenomena. As clearly do  Indra and the Dawn appear to be natural phenomena. But no less an  authority than Herbert Spencer has attacked this view: \"Facts imply  that the conception of the dawn as a person results from the giving of  dawn as a birth-name.\"[9] And again: \"If, then, Dawn [in New Zealand  and elsewhere] is an actual name for a person, if where there prevails  this mode of distinguishing children, it has probably often been given  to those born early in the morning; the traditions concerning one of  such who became noted, would, in the mind of the uncritical savage ...  lead to identification with the dawn.\"[10] In another passage: \"The  primitive god is the superior man ... propitiated during his life and  still more after his death.\"[11] Summing up, Spencer thus concludes:  \"Instead of seeing in the common character of so-called myths, that  they describe combats of beings using weapons, evidence that they  arose out of human transactions; mythologists assume that the order of  Nature presents itself to the undeveloped mind in terms of victories  and defeats.\"[12] Moreover (_a posteriori_), \"It is not true that the  primitive man looks at the powers of Nature with awe. It is not true  that he speculates about their characters and causes.\"[13] If Spencer  had not included in his criticism the mythologists that have written  on Vedic religion, there would be no occasion to take his opinion into  consideration. But since he claims by the light of his comparative  studies to have shown that in the Rig Veda the \"so-called nature  gods,\"[14] were not the oldest, and explains Dawn here exactly as he  does in New Zealand, it becomes necessary to point out, that apart  from the question of the origin of religions in general, Spencer has  made a fatal error in assuming that he is dealing in the Rig Veda with  primitive religion, uncritical savages, and undeveloped minds. And  furthermore, as the poet of the Rig Veda is not primitive, or savage,  or undeveloped, so when he worships _Dyaus pitar_ [Greek: Zeus pataer]  as the 'sky-father,' he not only makes it evident to every reader that  he really is worshipping the visible sky above; but in his  descriptions of gods such as Indra, the Dawn, and some other new gods  he invents from time to time, long after he has passed the savage,  primitive, and undeveloped state, he makes it no less clear that he  worships phenomena as they stand before him (rain, cloud, lightning,  etc.), so that by analogy with what is apparent in the case of later  divinities, one is led inevitably to predicate the same origin as  theirs in the case of the older gods.    But it is unnecessary to spend time on this point. It is impossible  for any sober scholar to read the Rig Veda and believe that the Vedic  poets are not worshipping natural phenomena; or that the phenomena so  worshipped were not the original forms of these gods. Whether at a  more remote time there was ever a period when the pre-historic Hindu,  or his pre-Indic ancestor, worshipped the Manes exclusively is another  question, and one with which at present we have nothing to do. The  history of Hindu religions begins with the Rig Veda, and in this  period the worship of Manes and that of natural phenomena were  distinct, nor are there any indications that the latter was ever  developed from the former. It is not denied that the Hindus made gods  of departed men. They did this long after the Vedic period. But there  is no proof that all the Vedic gods, as claims Spencer, were the  worshipped souls of the dead. No _argumentum a fero_ can show in a  Vedic dawn-hymn anything other than a hymn to personified Dawn, or  make it probable that this dawn was ever a mortal's name.    In respect of that which precedes all tradition we, whose task is not  to speculate in regard to primitive religious conceptions, but to give  the history of one people's religious progress, may be pardoned for  expressing no opinion. But without abandoning history (i.e.,  tradition) we would revert for a moment to the pre-Indian period and  point out that Zarathustra's rejection of the _daevas_ which must be  the same _devas_ that are worshipped in India, proves that  _deva_-worship is the immediate predecessor of the Hindu religion. As  far back as one can scrutinize the Aryan past he finds, as the  earliest known objects of reverence, 'sun' and 'sky,' besides and  beside the blessed Manes. A word here regarding the priority of  monotheism or of polytheism. The tradition is in favor of the latter,  while on _a priori_ grounds whoever thinks that the more primitive the  race the more apt it is for monotheism will postulate, with some of  the older scholars, an assumed monotheism as the pre-historic religion  of the Hindus; while whosoever opines that man has gradually risen  from a less intellectual stage will see in the early gods of the  Hindus only another illustration of one universal fact, and posit even  Aryan polytheism as an advance on the religion which it is probable  that the remoter ancestors of the Aryans once acknowledged.    A word perhaps should be said, also, in order to a better  understanding between the ethnologists as represented by Andrew Lang,  and the unfortunate philologists whom it delights him to pommel.  Lang's clever attacks on the myth-makers, whom he persistently  describes as the philologists--and they do indeed form part of that  camp--have had the effect of bringing 'philological theories' into sad  disrepute with sciolists and 'common-sense' people. But the sun-myths  and dawn-myths that the myth-makers discover in Cinderella and Red  Riding Hood, ought not to be fathered upon all philologists. On the  other hand, who will deny that in India certain mythological figures  are eoian or solar in origin? Can any one question that Vivasvant the  'wide gleaming' is sun or bright sky, as he is represented in the  Avesta and Rig Veda? Yet is a very anthropomorphic, nay, earthly  figure, made out of this god. Or is Mr. Lang ignorant that the god  Yima became Jemshid, and that Feridun is only the god Trita? It  undoubtedly is correct to illuminate the past with other light than  that of sun or dawn, yet that these lights have shone and have been  quenched in certain personalities may be granted without doing  violence to scientific principles. All purely etymological mythology  is precarious, but one may recognize sun-myths without building a  system on the basis of a Dawn-Helen, and without referring Ilium to  the Vedic _bila_. Again, myths about gods, heroes, and fairies are to  be segregated. Even in India, which teems with it, there is little, if  any, folklore that can be traced to solar or dawn-born myths. Mr. Lang  represents a healthy reaction against too much sun-myth, but we think  that there are sun-myths still, and that despite his protests all  religion is not grown from one seed.    There remains the consideration of the second part of the double  problem which was formulated above--the method of interpretation. The  native method is to believe the scholiasts' explanations, which often  are fanciful and, in all important points, totally unreliable; since  the Hindu commentators lived so long after the period of the  literature they expound that the tradition they follow is useful only  in petty details. From a modern point of view the question of  interpretation depends mainly on whether one regard the Rig Veda as  but an Indic growth, the product of the Hindu mind alone, or as a work  that still retains from an older age ideas which, having once been  common to Hindu and Iranian, should be compared with those in the  Persian Avesta and be illustrated by them. Again, if this latter  hypothesis be correct, how is one to interpret an apparent likeness,  here and there, between Indic and foreign notions,--is it possible  that the hymns were composed, in part, before the advent of the  authors into India, and is it for this reason that in the Rig Veda are  contained certain names, ideas, and legends, which do not seem to be  native to India? On the other hand, if one adopt the theory that the  Rig Veda is wholly a native work, in how far is he to suppose that it  is separable from Brahmanic formalism? Were the hymns made  independently of any ritual, as their own excuse for being, or were  they composed expressly for the sacrifice, as part of a formal cult?    Here are views diverse enough, but each has its advocate or advocates.  According to the earlier European writers the Vedic poets are  fountains of primitive thought, streams unsullied by any tributaries,  and in reading them one quaffs a fresh draught, the gush of  unsophisticated herdsmen, in whose religion there is to be seen a  childlike belief in natural phenomena as divine forces, over which  forces stands the Heaven-god as the highest power. So in 1869  Pfleiderer speaks of the \"primeval childlike naive prayer\" of Rig Veda  vi. 51. 5 (\"Father sky, mother earth,\" etc.);[15] while Pictet, in his  work _Les Origines Indo-Europeennes_, maintains that the Aryans had a  primitive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#3)"],[1,"suction  necessary for efficient lactation, and has hit upon this fanciful and  traditional explanation. The doctor, who knows that the tongue takes  no part in the act of sucking, will probably be able to demonstrate  that the failure to suck is due to nasal obstruction, and that the  child is forced to let go the nipple because respiration is impeded.  The opportunities for close observation of the child which mothers  enjoy are so great that we shall not often be justified in  disregarding their statements. But if we are able to give the true  explanation of the symptoms, it will seldom happen that the mother  will fail to be convinced, because the explanation, if true, will fit  accurately with all that has been observed. Thus the mother of the  child in whom defaecation is inhibited by negativism may have made  further observations. For example, she may have noted that the  so-called constipation causes fretfulness, that it is almost always  benefited by a visit to the country or seaside, or that it has become  much worse since a new nurse, who is much distressed by it, has taken  over the management of the child. To this mother the explanation must  be extended to fit these observations, of the accuracy of which there  need be no doubt. Fretfulness and negativism with all children whose  management is at fault come in waves and cycles. The child, naughty  and almost unmanageable one week, may behave as a model of propriety  the next. The negativism and refusal to go to stool are the outcome of  the nervous unrest, not its cause. Again, the nervous child, like the  adult neuropath, very often improves for the time being with every  change of scene and surroundings. It is the _ennui_ and monotony of  daily existence, in contact with the same restricted circle, that  becomes insupportable and brings into prominence the lack of moral  discipline, the fretfulness, and spirit of opposition. Lastly, the  conduct of the nervous child is determined to a great extent by  suggestions derived from the grown-up people around him. Refusal of  food, refusal of sleep, refusal to go to stool, as we shall see later,  only become frequent or habitual when the child's conduct visibly  distresses the nurse or mother, and when the child fully appreciates  the stir which he is creating. The mother will readily understand that  in such a case, where constipation varies in degree according as  different persons take charge of the child, the explanation offered is  that which alone fits with the observed facts. A full and free  discussion between mother and doctor, repeated it may be more than  once, may be necessary before the truth is arrived at, and a line of  action decided upon. Only so can the doctor, remote as he is from the  environment of the child, intervene to mould its nature and shape its  conduct.    If the doctor is to fit himself to give advice of this sort, he must  be a close observer of little children. He must not consider it  beneath his dignity to study nursery life and nursery ways. There he  will find the very beginnings of things, the growing point, as it  were, of all neuropathy. A man of fifty, who in many other ways showed  evidence of a highly nervous temperament, had especially one  well-marked phobia, the fear of falling downstairs. It had never been  absent all his life, and he had grown used to making the descent of  the stairs clinging firmly to the stair-rail. Family tradition  assigned this infirmity to a fall downstairs in early childhood. But  all children fall downstairs and are none the worse. The persistence  of the fear was due, I make no doubt, to the attitude of the parents  or nurse, who made much of the accident, impressed the occasion  strongly on the child's memory, and surrounded him thereafter with  precautions which sapped his confidence and fanned his fears.    In what follows we will consider first the subject of nursery  management, searching in it for the origin of the common disorders of  conduct both of childhood and of later life. I have grouped these  nursery observations under the heads of four characteristic features  of the child's psychology--his Imitativeness, his Suggestibility, his  Love of Power, and his acute though limited Reasoning Faculties. I  feel that some such brief examination is necessary if we are to  understand correctly the aetiology of some of the most troublesome  disorders of childhood, such as enuresis, anorexia, dyspepsia, or  constipation, disorders in which the nervous element is perhaps to-day  not sufficiently emphasised. Finally, we can evolve a kind of nursery  psycho-therapeutics--a subject which is not only of fascinating  interest in itself, but which repays consideration by the success  which it brings to our efforts to cure and control.          CHAPTER II    OBSERVATIONS IN THE NURSERY      _(a)_ THE IMITATIVENESS OF THE CHILD    It is in the second and third years of the child's life that the  rapidity of the development of the mental processes is most apparent,  and it is with that age that we may begin a closer examination. At  first sight it might seem more reasonable to adopt a strictly  chronological order, and to start with the infant from the day of his  birth. Since, however, we can only interpret the mind of the child by  our knowledge of our own mental processes, the study of the older  child and of the later stages is in reality the simpler task. The  younger the infant, the greater the difficulties become, so that our  task is not so much to trace the development of a process from simple  and early forms to those which are later and more complex, as to  follow a track which is comparatively plain in later childhood, but  grows faint as the beginnings of life are approached.    At the age, then, of two or three the first quality of the child which  may arrest our attention is his extreme imitativeness. Not that the  imitation on his part is in any way conscious; but like a mirror he  reflects in every action and in every word all that he sees and hears  going on around him. We must recognise that in these early days his  words and actions are not an independent growth, with roots in his own  consciousness, but are often only the reflection of the words and  actions of others. How completely speech is imitative is shown by the  readiness with which a child contracts the local accent of his  birthplace. The London parents awake with horror to find their baby an  indubitable Cockney; the speech of the child bred beyond the Tweed  proclaims him a veritable Scot. Again, some people are apt to adopt a  somewhat peremptory tone in addressing little children. Often they do  not trouble to give to their voices that polite or deferential  inflection which they habitually use when speaking to older people.  Listen to a party of nurses in the Park addressing their charges. As  if they knew that their commands have small chance of being obeyed,  they shout them with incisive force. \"Come along at once when I tell  you,\" they say. And the child faithfully reflects it all back, and is  heard ordering his little sister about like a drill sergeant, or  curtly bidding his grandmother change her seat to suit his pleasure.  If we are to have pretty phrases and tones of voice, mothers must see  to it that the child habitually hears no other. Again, mothers will  complain that their child is deaf, or, at any rate, that he has the  bad habit of responding to all remarks addressed to him by saying,  \"What?\" or, worse still, \"Eh?\" Often enough the reason that he does so  is not that the child is deaf, nor that he is particularly slow to  understand, but simply that he himself speaks so indistinctly that no  matter what he says to the grown-up people around him, they bend over  him and themselves utter the objectionable word.    We all hate the tell-tale child, and when a boy comes in from his walk  and has much to say of the wicked behaviour of his little sister on  the afternoon's outing, his mother is apt to see in this a most horrid  tendency towards tale-bearing and currying of favour. She does not  realise that day by day, when the children have come in from their  walk, she has asked nurse in their hearing if they have been good  children; and when, as often happens, they have not, the nurse has  duly recounted their shortcomings, with the laudable notion of putting  them to shame, and of emphasising to them the wickedness of their  backsliding--and this son of hers is no hypocrite, but speaks only, as  all children speak, in faithful reproduction of all that he hears.  Those grown-up persons who are in charge of the children must realise  that the child's vocabulary is their vocabulary, not his own. It is  unfortunate, but I think not unavoidable, that so often almost the  earliest words that the infant learns to speak are words of reproof,  or chiding, or repression. The baby scolds himself with gusto,  uttering reproof in the very tone of his elders: \"No, no,\" \"Naughty,\"  or \"Dirty,\" or \"Baby shocked.\"    Speech, then, is imitative from the first, if we except the early baby  sounds with reduplication of consonants to which in course of time  definite meaning becomes attached, as \"Ba-ba,\" \"Ma-ma,\" \"Na-na,\"  \"Ta-ta,\" and so forth. Action only becomes imitative at a somewhat  later stage. The first purposive movements of the child's limbs are  carried out in order to evoke tactile sensations. He delights to  stimulate and develop the sense of touch. At first he has no knowledge  of distance, and his reach exceeds his grasp. He will strain to touch  and hold distant objects. Gradually he learns the limitations of  space, and will pick up and hold an object in his hand with precision.  Often he conveys everything to his mouth, not because his teeth are  worrying him, or because he is hungry, as we hear sometimes alleged,  but because his mouth, lips, and tongue are more sensitive, because  more plentifully furnished with the nerves of"]]]
