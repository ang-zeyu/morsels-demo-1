Whatever the fate of the harbour seals should be, there can be  no doubt that the harps or Greenland seals, the bearded or  square-flippers, the grey or horseheads, and the gigantic and  magnificently game hoods, should all be put under conservation. I am  also inclined to think that the walrus could be coaxed back to what once  were some of his most favourite haunts. Just now he has no chance  whatever; and he is so extremely rare that the one I nearly rowed the  dinghy into last August, down at Whale Head East, was only the second  seen inside the Straits during the present century.          III. PLAN OF CONSERVATION FOR THE CANADIAN LABRADOR.      Whaling, sealing and deep-sea fishing are Dominion and international  affairs; and whaling, at all events, is soon to engage the attention of  statesmen, experts and the public--let us hope, to some good end. The  inland birds and mammals from the St. Lawrence to Ungava now come under  the Province of Quebec; though no effective protection has ever reached  the Canadian Labrador. Beyond this, again, lies the Atlantic Labrador,  which is entirely under Newfoundland. So I would suggest that the  Commission should try a five-year experiment in the conservation of  seabird life along the Canadian Labrador, because this would not come  into overlapping contact with any other exercised authority, because it  is bound to be successful, because it will only cost a sum that should  be had for the asking, because it is most urgently pressing, and because  it can be begun at once, to the lasting advantage of all concerned.    The \"Canadian Labrador\" is the last remaining vestige of the  No-Man's-Land which, only a hundred years ago, began at the Saguenay,  within 120 miles of Quebec. Then, as the organised \"North Shore\"  advanced down stream, the unorganised \"Canadian Labrador\" receded before  it. Fifty years ago the dividing line was at Seven Islands, 300 miles  below Quebec. To-day it runs just east of Natashquan and is a full 500  miles below.    There is no stranger country anywhere than this Canadian Labrador. Dr  Grenfell's Labrador, which has nothing to do with Canada, is known to  everyone. But the very existence of our own Labrador, with its 200  miles of coastline and its more than 20,000 islands, is quite unknown,  as a separate entity, to all but a very few outside of its little, but  increasing, population of 1200 souls. It lies on the north shore of the  Gulf, just inside the Straits of Belle Isle, and runs from Bradore in  the east to Kegashka in the west. Here, close beside the crowded track  of ocean liners, and well below the latitude of London, is by far the  most southerly arctic region in the world. It is a land of rock and  moss; for, except along the river valleys, there are neither grass nor  trees. No crops are grown or ever can be grown. There are no horses,  cattle, poultry, pigs or sheep. Reindeer are said to be coming. But  there are none at present. The only domestic animals are dogs, that howl  like wolves, but never bark. And yet it is a country which is rich, and  might he richer still, in fish and fur, and which seems formed by Nature  to be a perfect paradise of all that is most desirable in the wild life  of the north, especially in the seabirds that are now being done to  death among its countless archipelagoes.    Its natural features are not the only strange things in it. It is a  curiosity of government, or, rather, of the want of government. It is  _in_ the Province of Quebec and _in_ the Dominion; yet, in one sense,  not _of_ either. For it in the only place of its kind inhabited by  educated whites, in any part of the self-governing Empire, where no man  has ever cast a single vote or ever had the right to cast one. The  electoral line stops short at Natashquan, 36 miles west of Kegashka. So  1200 good Canadians have no vote. They are dumb and their two  governments are deaf. They have bought their little holdings from the  Province; and they pay Canadian custom dues to the Dominion, on  everything they get from the Quebec truck traders or the Hudson Bay  posts, in exchange for their fish and fur. But they do not enjoy even  the elementary right of protection from depredation committed by men who  have no claim on Canada at all. Let me add that by this I do not mean  for one moment to abuse my friends the Newfoundlanders. A kindlier  people I have never met. Nor do I mean to abuse the Americans and Nova  Scotians who sometimes slink inside the three-mile limit. But I do mean  to draw attention to the regrettable fact that the absence of all  wild-life conservation is becoming ruinous to everyone concerned--even  to the exterminating Newfoundlanders, who are now making our shores as  bleak a desert as they have made their own.    Of course the Canadian Labrador should help itself. Let it form a  \"Neighbourhood Improvement Association\" under the Commission. There are  good leaders in Dr Hare, the head of the medical mission; in the three  religious missions--Anglican, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic; and among  the principal fishermen, who are mostly Anglo- but partly  French-Canadian. What the coast needs is not coddling and charity but  conservation and protection against depredators from outside. The best  way to begin is to protect the seabirds. And the best body to do this is  the Commission of Conservation. The Province of Quebec has just put the  finishing touch to a great work by establishing an animal sanctuary in  the heart of the Laurentides National Park. It is also doing good work  by making the game laws more effective elsewhere. But, being dependently  human, it can hardly pass over the whole North Shore of voters in order  to give special protection to the little, voteless No-Man's-Land of the  Canadian Labrador; though immediate special protection is a very vital  concern to that most neglected part of Canada. The Dominion stops short  by water as decidedly as the Province does by land. So an ideal place is  left defenceless between the two, as if expressly made for the  Commission to conserve.    I know that the Commission cannot undertake any executive work of a  permanent character. But it can undertake an experimental investigation  for a term of years. And, here again, the Canadian Labrador offers a  perfect field. For if only five years' effective conservation is  extended to the bird life of that coast the whole situation will be  saved. I do not presume to lay down the law on the subject. But I would  venture to suggest that some such plan as the following would probably  be found quite effective at the very moderate cost of five thousand  dollars a year.    1. The residents to form their own \"Neighbourhood Improvement  Association\" under the Commission of Conservation.    2. The Commission to protect the bird life of the coast experimentally  for five years, from the 1st of May, 1913.    3. The 200 miles of coast, from Kegashka to Bradore, to be divided into  5 beats. One local boat and two local men to each beat, from the 1st of  May to the 1st of September, by contract, at $600 a boat = $3,000. Each  boat to have a motor capable of doing at least 6 knots an hour. Local  men are essential. Strangers, however good otherwise, would be lost in  that labyrinth of uncharted and unlighted islands. $2 a day a man is not  too much for these men, who would have to give up their whole time in  the busy season, the only season, in fact, when they make money, except  for the chance of \"furring\". $1 a day a boat is equally reasonable. The  five beats might be called the Romaine, Harrington, Tabatiere,  Shekattika and Bradore.    4. A sixth boat should move about inspecting the whole coast during the  season. It should have a trained naturalist as Inspector, the local game  warden of the Province of Quebec, and a crew of two men. The Quebec  warden would be paid by the Province. The men and boat, in view of the  larger size of the boat and the greater expenditure of fuel, would be,  say, $6 a day, instead of $5, which, for 4 months, would mean $720. The  Inspector's salary and the incidental expenses of the service would make  up the $5,000. The Province would pay the cost of punishing offenders.  Fines should be divided between the Province and the men who effect the  arrests.    5. One necessary expense would be officially warning the Newfoundlanders  and other depredators through their own press.    6. Arrange co-operation with the Dominion Fisheries Protection Service  and Dominion Government telegraph line; also with the Provincial  Government, which would naturally be glad to have red-handed offenders  consigned to it for punishment. The Commission's boats might be very  useful in giving information to the Fisheries Protection Service, and  _vice versa_. All conservation telegrams should be free.    7. Forbid all outsiders to take eggs or young birds, or to shoot  anything before the 1st of September, or to shoot after that without a  license.    8. Allow genuine residents of the Canadian Labrador to take ducks' and  gulls' eggs up to the 1st of June, and murres', auks' and puffins' eggs  up to the 15th of June. Allow them to take young birds only in case of  sickness: (gull broth is the local equivalent of chicken broth). Allow  them to shoot after the 1st of September without a license. The  conditions of the coast require these exceptions, which will not  endanger the bird life there.    9. Establish one bird sanctuary on the inshore islands between Fond au  Fecteau and Whale Head East, and another on the inshore islands round  Yankee Harbour (Wapitagun).    10. These islands are favourite haunts of the American eider  (\"sea-duck\", \"metik\", _Somateria dresseri_.)

Take to every pound of Cherries a quarter of Sugar, of  which take half, and dissolve it with the Cherry water drained from the  Cherries, and keep them boiling very fast till they will gelly in a  spoon, and as you see the syrup thin, take off the Sugar that you kept  finely beaten, and put it to the Cherries in the boiling, the faster  they boil, the better they will be preserved, and let them stand in a  Pan till they be almost cold.        _A Tincture of Ambergreece._    Take Ambergreece one ounce, Musk two drams, spirit of Wine half a pint,  or as much as will cover the ingredients two or three fingers breadth,  put all into a glass, stop it close with a Cork and Bladder; set it in  Horse dung ten or twelve days, then pour off gently the Spirit of Wine,  and keep it in a Glass close stopt, then put more spirit of Wine on the  Ambergreece, and do as before, then pour it off, after all this the  Ambergreece will serve for ordinary uses. A drop of this will perfume  any thing, and in Cordials it is very good.        _To make Usquebath the best way._    Take two quarts of the best _Aqua vitae_, four ounces of scraped  liquorish, and half a pound of sliced Raisins of the Sun, Anniseeds four  ounces, Dates and Figs, of each half a pound, sliced Nutmeg, Cinnamon,  Ginger, of each half an ounce, put these to the _Aqua vitae_, stop it  very close, and set it in a cold place ten dayes, stirring it twice a  day with a stick, then strain and sweeten it with Sugar-candy; after it  is strained, let it stand till it be clear, then put into the glass Musk  and Ambergreece; two grains is sufficient for this quantity.        _To preserve Cherries with a quarter of their weights in Sugar._    Take four pound of Cherries, one pound of Sugar, beat your Sugar and  strew a little in the bottom of your skillet, then pull off the stalk  and stones of your Cherries, and cut them cross the bottom with a knife;  let the juyce of the Cherries run upon the Sugar; for there must be no  other liquor but the juyce of the Cherries; cover your Cherries over  with one half of your Sugar, boil them very quick, when they are half  boiled, put in the remainder of your sugar, when they are almost enough,  put in the rest of the sugar; you must let them boil till they part in  sunder like Marmalade, stirring them continually; so put them up hot  into your Marmalade glasses.        _To make Gelly of Pippins._    Take Pippins, and pare them, and quarter them, and put as much water to  them as will cover them, and let them boil till all the vertue of the  Pippins are out; then strain them, and take to a pint of that liquor a  pound of Sugar, and cut long threads of Orange peels, and boil in it,  then take a Lemon, and pare and slice it very thin, and boil it in your  liquor a little thin, take them out, and lay them in the bottom of your  glass, and when it is boiled to a gelly, pour it on the Lemons in the  glass. You must boil the Oranges in two or three waters before you boil  it in the gelly.        _To make Apricock Cakes._    Take the fairest Apricocks you can get, and parboil them very tender,  then take off the Pulp and their weight of Sugar, and boil the Sugar and  Apricocks together very fast, stir them ever lest they burn to, and when  you can see the bottom of the Skillet it is enough; then put then into  Cards sowed round, and dust them with fine Sugar, and when they are cold  stone them, then turn them, and fill them up with some more of the same  stuff; but you must let them stand for three or four dayes before you  turn them off the first place; and when you find they begin to candy,  take them out of the Cards, dust them with Sugar again; so do ever when  you turn them.        _To preserve Barberries the best way._    First stone them and weigh them, half a pound of sugar to half a pound  of them, then pair them and slice them into that liquor, take the weight  of it in sugar; then take as many Rasberries as will colour it, and  strain them into the liquor, then put in the sugar, boil it as fast as  you can, then skim it till it be very clear, then put in your  Barberries, and that sugar you weighed, and so let them boil till the  skin be fully risen up, then take them off, and skin them very clean,  and put them up.        _To make Lozenges of Red Roses._    Boil your sugar to sugar again, then put in your Red Roses being finely  beaten and made moist with the juyce of a Lemmon, let it not boil after  the Roses are in but pour it upon a Pye-plate, and cut it into what form  you please.        _To make Chips of Quinces._    First scald them very well, then slice them into a Dish, and pour a  Candy Syrup to them scalding hot, and let them stand all night, then lay  them on plates, and searse sugar on them, and turn them every day, and  scrape more sugar on them till they be dry. If you would have them look  clear, heat them in syrup, but not to boil.        _To make Sugar of Wormwood, Mint, Anniseed, or any other of that kinde._    Take double refined Sugar, and do but wet it in fair water, or  Rose-water and boil it to a Candy, when it is almost boiled take it off,  and stir it till it be cold; then drop in three or four drops of the  Oyls of whatsoever you will make, and stir it well; then drop it on a  board, being before fitted with Sugar.        _To make Syrup of Lemons or Citrons._    Pare off all the rindes, then slice your Lemmons very thin, and lay a  lare of Sugar finely beaten, and a lare of Lemons in a silver Bason  till you have filled it, or as much as you mean to make, & so let it  stand all night; the next day pour off the liquor that runs from it into  a glass through a Tiffany strainer. Be sure you put sugar enough to them  at the first, and it will keep a year good, if it be set up well.        _To make Jambals of Apricocks or Quinces._    Take Apricocks or Quinces, and quoddle them tender, then take their Pulp  and dry it in a dish over a Chafing-dish of coals, and set it in a Stove  for a day or two; then beat it in a stone Mortar, putting in as much  Sugar as will make a stiff paste; then colour it with Saunders,  Cochinele or blew Starch, and make it up in what colour you please, rowl  them with battle doors into long pieces, and tye them up in knots, and  so dry them.        _To make Cherry-water._    Take nine pound of Cherries, pull out the stones and stalks, break them  with you hand, and put them into nine pints of Claret Wine, take nine  ounces of Cinamon, and three Nutmegs, bruise them, and put them into  this, then take of Rosemary and Balm, of each half a handful, of sweet  Marjoram a quarter of a handful; put all these with the aforenamed into  an earthen pot well leaded; so let them stand to infuse twenty four  hours; so distil it in a Limbeck, keeping the strongest water by it  self, put some sugar finely beaten into your glasses. If your first  water be too strong, put some of the second to it as you use it. If you  please you may tye some Musk and Ambergreese, in a rag, and hang it by a  thread in your glass.        _To make Orange Cakes._    Take Oranges and pare them as thin as you can, then take out the meats  clean, and put them in water; let them lye about an hour, shift the  water, and boil them very tender in three or four waters, then put them  up, and dry them on a cloath: mince them as small as you can, then put  them into a dish, and squeeze all the juyce of the meat into them, and  let them stand till the next day, take to every pound of these a pound  and a quarter of double refined Sugar. Boil it with a spoonful of water  at the bottom to keep it from burning till it be Sugar again; then put  in your Oranges and let them stand and dry on the fire, but not boil;  then put them on glass plates, and put them in a stove, the next day  make them into Cakes, and so fry them as fast as you can.        _To preserve Oranges the French way._    Take twelve of the fairest Oranges and best coloured, and if you can get  them with smooth skins they are the better, and lay them in Conduit  water, six dayes and nights, shifting them into fresh water morning and  evening; then boil them very tender, and with a knife pare them very  thin, rub them with salt, when you have so done, core them with a coring  Iron, taking out the meat and seeds; then rub them with a dry cloth till  they be clean, add to every pound of Oranges a pound and half of Sugar,  and to a pound of sugar a pint of water; then mingle your, sugar and  water well together in a large skillet or pan; beat the whites of three  Eggs and put that into it, then set it on the fire, and let it boil  till it rises, and strain it through a Napkin; then set it on the fire  again, and let it boil till the syrup be thick, then put in your  Oranges, and make them seethe as fast as you can, now and then putting  in a piece of fine loaf Sugar the bigness of a Walnut, when they have  boiled near an hour, put into them a pint of Apple water; then boil them  apace, and add half a pint of white Wine, this should be put in before  the Apple-water, when your Oranges are very clear, & your Syrup is so  thick that it will gelly, (which you may know by setting some to cool in  a spoon) when they are ready to be taken off from the fire; then put in  the juyce of eight Lemons warm into them, then put them into an earthen  pan, and so let them stand till they be cold, then put every Orange in a  several glass or pot; if you do but six Oranges at a time it is the  better.        _To preserve"]]]
