When the fifteen Spanish citizens came into the market-place and found  there the little body of armed Englishmen, they immediately fired upon  them, not knowing or caring who they were. This brave resistance seems  to have frightened Drake and his men almost as much as their trumpets  and guns had frightened the citizens, and the English immediately  retreated from the town. When they reached the place where they had left  the rest of their party, they found that these had already run away, and  taken to the boats. Consequently Drake and his brave men were obliged to  take off some of their clothes and to wade out to the little ships. The  Englishmen secured no booty whatever, and killed only one Spaniard, who  was a man who had been looking out of a window to see what was the  matter.    Whether or not Drake's conscience had anything to do with the bungling  manner in which he made this first attempt at piracy, we cannot say, but  he soon gave his conscience a holiday, and undertook some very  successful robbing enterprises. He received information from some  natives, that a train of mules was coming across the Isthmus of Panama  loaded with gold and silver bullion, and guarded only by their drivers;  for the merchants who owned all this treasure had no idea that there was  any one in that part of the world who would commit a robbery upon them.  But Drake and his men soon proved that they could hold up a train of  mules as easily as some of the masked robbers in our western country  hold up a train of cars. All the gold was taken, but the silver was too  heavy for the amateur pirates to carry.    Two days after that, Drake and his men came to a place called \"The House  of Crosses,\" where they killed five or six peaceable merchants, but were  greatly disappointed to find no gold, although the house was full of  rich merchandise of various kinds. As his men had no means of carrying  away heavy goods, he burned up the house and all its contents and went  to his ships, and sailed away with the treasure he had already obtained.    Whatever this gallant ex-chaplain now thought of himself, he was  considered by the Spaniards as an out-and-out pirate, and in this  opinion they were quite correct. During his great voyage around the  world, which he began in 1577, he came down upon the Spanish-American  settlements like a storm from the sea. He attacked towns, carried off  treasure, captured merchant-vessels,--and in fact showed himself to be a  thoroughbred and accomplished pirate of the first class.    It was in consequence of the rich plunder with which his ships were now  loaded, that he made his voyage around the world. He was afraid to go  back the way he came, for fear of capture, and so, having passed the  Straits of Magellan, and having failed to find a way out of the Pacific  in the neighborhood of California, he doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and  sailed along the western coast of Africa to European waters.    This grand piratical expedition excited great indignation in Spain,  which country was still at peace with England, and even in England there  were influential people who counselled the Queen that it would be wise  and prudent to disavow Drake's actions, and compel him to restore to  Spain the booty he had taken from his subjects. But Queen Elizabeth was  not the woman to do that sort of thing. She liked brave men and brave  deeds, and she was proud of Drake. Therefore, instead of punishing him,  she honored him, and went to take dinner with him on board his ship,  which lay at Deptford.    So Columbus does not stand alone as a grand master of piracy. The famous  Sir Francis Drake, who became vice-admiral of the fleet which defeated  the Spanish Armada, was a worthy companion of the great Genoese.    These notable instances have been mentioned because it would be unjust  to take up the history of those resolute traders who sailed from  England, France, and Holland, to the distant waters of the western world  for the purpose of legitimate enterprise and commerce, and who  afterwards became thorough-going pirates, without trying to make it  clear that they had shining examples for their notable careers.          Chapter III    Pupils in Piracy      After the discoveries of Columbus, the Spanish mind seems to have been  filled with the idea that the whole undiscovered world, wherever it  might be, belonged to Spain, and that no other nation had any right  whatever to discover anything on the other side of the Atlantic, or to  make any use whatever of lands which had been discovered. In fact, the  natives of the new countries, and the inhabitants of all old countries  except her own, were considered by Spain as possessing no rights  whatever. If the natives refused to pay tribute, or to spend their days  toiling for gold for their masters, or if vessels from England or France  touched at one of their settlements for purposes of trade, it was all  the same to the Spaniards; a war of attempted extermination was waged  alike against the peaceful inhabitants of Hispaniola, now Hayti, and  upon the bearded and hardy seamen from Northern Europe. Under this  treatment the natives weakened and gradually disappeared; but the  buccaneers became more and more numerous and powerful.    The buccaneers were not unlike that class of men known in our western  country as cowboys. Young fellows of good families from England and  France often determined to embrace a life of adventure, and possibly  profit, and sailed out to the West Indies to get gold and hides, and to  fight Spaniards. Frequently they dropped their family names and assumed  others more suitable to roving freebooters, and, like the bold young  fellows who ride over our western plains, driving cattle and shooting  Indians, they adopted a style of dress as free and easy, but probably  not quite so picturesque, as that of the cowboy. They soon became a very  rough set of fellows, in appearance as well as action, endeavoring in  every way to let the people of the western world understand that they  were absolutely free and independent of the manners and customs, as well  as of the laws of their native countries.    So well was this independence understood, that when the buccaneers  became strong enough to inflict some serious injury upon the settlements  in the West Indies, and the Spanish court remonstrated with Queen  Elizabeth on account of what had been done by some of her subjects, she  replied that she had nothing to do with these buccaneers, who, although  they had been born in England, had ceased for the time to be her  subjects, and the Spaniards must defend themselves against them just as  if they were an independent nation.    But it is impossible for men who have been brought up in civilized  society, and who have been accustomed to obey laws, to rid themselves  entirely of all ideas of propriety and morality, as soon as they begin a  life of lawlessness. So it happened that many of the buccaneers could  not divest themselves of the notions of good behavior to which they had  been accustomed from youth. For instance, we are told of a captain of  buccaneers, who, landing at a settlement on a Sunday, took his crew to  church. As it is not at all probable that any of the buccaneering  vessels carried chaplains, opportunities of attending services must have  been rare. This captain seems to have wished to show that pirates in  church know what they ought to do just as well as other people; it was  for this reason that, when one of his men behaved himself in an improper  and disorderly manner during the service, this proper-minded captain  arose from his seat and shot the offender dead.    There was a Frenchman of that period who must have been a warm-hearted  philanthropist, because, having read accounts of the terrible atrocities  of the Spaniards in the western lands, he determined to leave his home  and his family, and become a buccaneer, in order that he might do what  he could for the suffering natives in the Spanish possessions. He  entered into the great work which he had planned for himself with such  enthusiasm and zeal, that in the course of time he came to be known as  \"The Exterminator,\" and if there had been more people of his  philanthropic turn of mind, there would soon have been no inhabitants  whatever upon the islands from which the Spaniards had driven out the  Indians.    There was another person of that day,--also a Frenchman,--who became  deeply involved in debt in his own country, and feeling that the  principles of honor forbade him to live upon and enjoy what was really  the property of others, he made up his mind to sail across the Atlantic,  and become a buccaneer. He hoped that if he should be successful in his  new profession, and should be enabled to rob Spaniards for a term of  years, he could return to France, pay off all his debts, and afterward  live the life of a man of honor and respectability.    Other ideas which the buccaneers brought with them from their native  countries soon showed themselves when these daring sailors began their  lives as regular pirates; among these, the idea of organization was very  prominent. Of course it was hard to get a number of free and  untrammelled crews to unite and obey the commands of a few officers. But  in time the buccaneers had recognized leaders, and laws were made for  concerted action. In consequence of this the buccaneers became a  formidable body of men, sometimes superior to the Spanish naval and  military forces.    It must be remembered that the buccaneers lived in a very peculiar age.  So far as the history of America is concerned, it might be called the  age of blood and gold. In the newly discovered countries there were no  laws which European nations or individuals cared to observe. In the West  Indies and the adjacent mainlands there were gold and silver,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17192"],[0,"The Raven (#3)"],[1,"Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.\"    Here Poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured Longfellow, and  which no one ever sought on his own premises without swift detection and  chastisement. In melody and stanzaic form, we shall see that the two poems  are not unlike, but in motive they are totally distinct. The generous  poetess felt nothing but the true originality of the poet. \"This vivid  writing!\" she exclaimed,--\"this power which is felt!... Our great poet, Mr.  Browning, author of 'Paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic in his admiration of  the rhythm.\" Mr. Ingram, after referring to \"Lady Geraldine,\" cleverly  points out another source from which Poe may have caught an impulse. In  1843, Albert Pike, the half-Greek, half-frontiersman, poet of Arkansas, had  printed in \"The New Mirror,\" for which Poe then was writing, some verses  entitled \"Isadore,\" but since revised by the author and called \"The Widowed  Heart.\" I select from Mr. Pike's revision the following stanza, of which  the main features correspond with the original version:        \"Restless I pace our lonely rooms, I play our songs no more,      The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;      The mocking-bird still sits and sings, O melancholy strain!      For my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain;                              Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!\"    Here we have a prolonged measure, a similarity of refrain, and the  introduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow. There are other trails  which may be followed by the curious; notably, a passage which Mr. Ingram  selects from Poe's final review of \"Barnaby Rudge\":         \"The raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now see       it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. * * * Its       character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot,       much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect       to the air.\"    Nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances, the value of  this poem still is found in its originality. The progressive music, the  scenic detail and contrasted light and shade,--above all, the spiritual  passion of the nocturn, make it the work of an informing genius. As for the  gruesome bird, he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the \"twa  corbies\" and \"three ravens\" of the balladists to Barnaby's rumpled \"Grip.\"  Here is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets and  treads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which Tickell sang that,  when,                \"shrieking at her window thrice,          The raven flap'd his wing,      Too well the love-lorn maiden knew          The solemn boding sound.\"    Poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a mourner's agony  and hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, the abiding chronicler of doom,  a type of the Irreparable. Escaped across the Styx, from \"the Night's  Plutonian shore,\" he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself,--of  him who can not, will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory of  Lenore is all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow even  that would be put aside.    _The Raven_ also may be taken as a representative poem of its author, for  its exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be. These are  found in his essays on \"The Poetic Principle,\" \"The Rationale of Verse,\"  and \"The Philosophy of Composition.\" Poe declared that \"in Music, perhaps,  the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the  Poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.... Verse  cannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music\"; but  again, verse which is really the \"Poetry of Words\" is \"The Rhythmical  Creation of Beauty,\"--this and nothing more. The _tone_ of the highest  Beauty is one of Sadness. The most melancholy of topics is Death. This must  be allied to Beauty. \"The death, then, of a beautiful woman is,  unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,--and equally is it  beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of a  bereaved lover.\" These last expressions are quoted from Poe's whimsical  analysis of this very poem, but they indicate precisely the general range  of his verse. The climax of \"The Bells\" is the muffled monotone of ghouls,  who glory in weighing down the human heart. \"Lenore,\" _The Raven_, \"The  Sleeper,\" \"To One in Paradise,\" and \"Ulalume\" form a tenebrose  symphony,--and \"Annabel Lee,\" written last of all, shows that one theme  possessed him to the end. Again, these are all nothing if not musical, and  some are touched with that quality of the Fantastic which awakes the sense  of awe, and adds a new fear to agony itself. Through all is dimly outlined,  beneath a shadowy pall, the poet's ideal love,--so often half-portrayed  elsewhere,--the entombed wife of Usher, the Lady Ligeia, in truth the  counterpart of his own nature. I suppose that an artist's love for one \"in  the form\" never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. The woman near  him must exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm him  with infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his allegiance.  He must be lured by the Unattainable, and this is ever just beyond him in  his passion for creative art.    Poe, like Hawthorne, came in with the decline of the Romantic school, and  none delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity. Yet his heart was  with the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic effects. His invention, so  rich in the prose tales, seemed to desert him when he wrote verse; and his  judgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident than  inspiration,--and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics would  suffice. Hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own limitations, that \"a  'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms.\" The components of _The  Raven_ are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at a  woman. But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. What have  we? The midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the  student,--a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintry  night and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vague  mistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid  bust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All this  stage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and  even melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits,  and thoroughly reflective of the poet's \"eternal passion, eternal pain.\"    The rhythmical structure of _The Raven_ was sure to make an impression.  Rhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form, were devised with  singular adroitness. Doubtless the poet was struck with the aptness of Miss  Barrett's musical trochaics, in \"eights,\" and especially by the arrangement  adopted near the close of \"Lady Geraldine\":        \"'Eyes,' he said, 'now throbbing through me! Are ye eyes that did undo me?      Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone!      Underneath that calm white forehead, are ye ever burning torrid      O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?'\"    His artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second and fourth  lines, and the addition of a fifth line and a final refrain, made the  stanza of _The Raven_. The persistent alliteration seems to come without  effort, and often the rhymes within lines are seductive; while the refrain  or burden dominates the whole work. Here also he had profited by Miss  Barrett's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. A  \"refrain\" is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering  ear,--the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain. I have always  admired the beautiful refrains of the English songstress,--\"The  Nightingales, the Nightingales,\" \"Margret, Margret,\" \"My Heart and I,\"  \"Toll slowly,\" \"The River floweth on,\" \"Pan, Pan is dead,\" etc. She also  employed what I term the Repetend, in the use of which Poe has excelled all  poets since Coleridge thus revived it:        \"O happy living things! no tongue      Their beauty might declare:      A spring of love gushed from my heart,      And I blessed them unaware:      Sure my kind saint took pity on me,      And I blessed them unaware.\"    Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend. He  relied upon it to the uttermost in a few later poems,--\"Lenore,\" \"Annabel  Lee,\" \"Ulalume,\" and \"For Annie.\" It gained a wild and melancholy music, I  have thought, from the \"sweet influences,\" of the Afric burdens and  repetends that were sung to him in childhood, attuning with their native  melody the voice of our Southern poet.    \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" his analysis of _The Raven_, is a  technical dissection of its method and structure. Neither his avowal of  cold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent avowal to friends that an  exposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes, need  be wholly credited. If he had designed the complete work in advance, he  scarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the  delicious melody of the second stanza,--not even upon his theory of the  fantastic. Of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like the  first Artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. A subsequent  analysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire, readily enough may  be made. My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this  poem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how it  might be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter on  Composition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor  "]]]
