Returning then to the Theaetetus, as the only possible source from which  an answer to these questions can be obtained, we may remark, that Plato  had 'The Truth' of Protagoras before him, and frequently refers to the  book. He seems to say expressly, that in this work the doctrine of the  Heraclitean flux was not to be found; 'he told the real truth' (not  in the book, which is so entitled, but) 'privately to his  disciples,'--words which imply that the connexion between the doctrines  of Protagoras and Heracleitus was not generally recognized in Greece,  but was really discovered or invented by Plato. On the other hand,  the doctrine that 'Man is the measure of all things,' is expressly  identified by Socrates with the other statement, that 'What appears to  each man is to him;' and a reference is made to the books in which the  statement occurs;--this Theaetetus, who has 'often read the books,' is  supposed to acknowledge (so Cratylus). And Protagoras, in the speech  attributed to him, never says that he has been misunderstood: he rather  seems to imply that the absoluteness of sensation at each instant was  to be found in his words. He is only indignant at the 'reductio ad  absurdum' devised by Socrates for his 'homo mensura,' which Theodorus  also considers to be 'really too bad.'    The question may be raised, how far Plato in the Theaetetus could  have misrepresented Protagoras without violating the laws of dramatic  probability. Could he have pretended to cite from a well-known writing  what was not to be found there? But such a shadowy enquiry is not worth  pursuing further. We need only remember that in the criticism which  follows of the thesis of Protagoras, we are criticizing the Protagoras  of Plato, and not attempting to draw a precise line between his real  sentiments and those which Plato has attributed to him.    2. The other difficulty is a more subtle, and also a more important one,  because bearing on the general character of the Platonic dialogues. On  a first reading of them, we are apt to imagine that the truth is only  spoken by Socrates, who is never guilty of a fallacy himself, and is the  great detector of the errors and fallacies of others. But this natural  presumption is disturbed by the discovery that the Sophists are  sometimes in the right and Socrates in the wrong. Like the hero of a  novel, he is not to be supposed always to represent the sentiments  of the author. There are few modern readers who do not side with  Protagoras, rather than with Socrates, in the dialogue which is  called by his name. The Cratylus presents a similar difficulty: in  his etymologies, as in the number of the State, we cannot tell how  far Socrates is serious; for the Socratic irony will not allow him  to distinguish between his real and his assumed wisdom. No one is the  superior of the invincible Socrates in argument (except in the first  part of the Parmenides, where he is introduced as a youth); but he is by  no means supposed to be in possession of the whole truth. Arguments are  often put into his mouth (compare Introduction to the Gorgias) which  must have seemed quite as untenable to Plato as to a modern writer.  In this dialogue a great part of the answer of Protagoras is just  and sound; remarks are made by him on verbal criticism, and on the  importance of understanding an opponent's meaning, which are conceived  in the true spirit of philosophy. And the distinction which he is  supposed to draw between Eristic and Dialectic, is really a criticism of  Plato on himself and his own criticism of Protagoras.    The difficulty seems to arise from not attending to the dramatic  character of the writings of Plato. There are two, or more, sides to  questions; and these are parted among the different speakers. Sometimes  one view or aspect of a question is made to predominate over the rest,  as in the Gorgias or Sophist; but in other dialogues truth is divided,  as in the Laches and Protagoras, and the interest of the piece consists  in the contrast of opinions. The confusion caused by the irony of  Socrates, who, if he is true to his character, cannot say anything  of his own knowledge, is increased by the circumstance that in the  Theaetetus and some other dialogues he is occasionally playing both  parts himself, and even charging his own arguments with unfairness. In  the Theaetetus he is designedly held back from arriving at a conclusion.  For we cannot suppose that Plato conceived a definition of knowledge to  be impossible. But this is his manner of approaching and surrounding a  question. The lights which he throws on his subject are indirect, but  they are not the less real for that. He has no intention of proving a  thesis by a cut-and-dried argument; nor does he imagine that a great  philosophical problem can be tied up within the limits of a definition.  If he has analyzed a proposition or notion, even with the severity of  an impossible logic, if half-truths have been compared by him with  other half-truths, if he has cleared up or advanced popular ideas, or  illustrated a new method, his aim has been sufficiently accomplished.    The writings of Plato belong to an age in which the power of analysis  had outrun the means of knowledge; and through a spurious use of  dialectic, the distinctions which had been already 'won from the void  and formless infinite,' seemed to be rapidly returning to their original  chaos. The two great speculative philosophies, which a century earlier  had so deeply impressed the mind of Hellas, were now degenerating into  Eristic. The contemporaries of Plato and Socrates were vainly trying to  find new combinations of them, or to transfer them from the object to  the subject. The Megarians, in their first attempts to attain a severer  logic, were making knowledge impossible (compare Theaet.). They were  asserting 'the one good under many names,' and, like the Cynics, seem  to have denied predication, while the Cynics themselves were depriving  virtue of all which made virtue desirable in the eyes of Socrates and  Plato. And besides these, we find mention in the later writings of  Plato, especially in the Theaetetus, Sophist, and Laws, of certain  impenetrable godless persons, who will not believe what they 'cannot  hold in their hands'; and cannot be approached in argument, because they  cannot argue (Theat; Soph.). No school of Greek philosophers exactly  answers to these persons, in whom Plato may perhaps have blended some  features of the Atomists with the vulgar materialistic tendencies of  mankind in general (compare Introduction to the Sophist).    And not only was there a conflict of opinions, but the stage which the  mind had reached presented other difficulties hardly intelligible to  us, who live in a different cycle of human thought. All times of mental  progress are times of confusion; we only see, or rather seem to see  things clearly, when they have been long fixed and defined. In the  age of Plato, the limits of the world of imagination and of pure  abstraction, of the old world and the new, were not yet fixed. The  Greeks, in the fourth century before Christ, had no words for 'subject'  and 'object,' and no distinct conception of them; yet they were always  hovering about the question involved in them. The analysis of sense, and  the analysis of thought, were equally difficult to them; and hopelessly  confused by the attempt to solve them, not through an appeal to facts,  but by the help of general theories respecting the nature of the  universe.    Plato, in his Theaetetus, gathers up the sceptical tendencies of his  age, and compares them. But he does not seek to reconstruct out of them  a theory of knowledge. The time at which such a theory could be framed  had not yet arrived. For there was no measure of experience with which  the ideas swarming in men's minds could be compared; the meaning of  the word 'science' could scarcely be explained to them, except from the  mathematical sciences, which alone offered the type of universality and  certainty. Philosophy was becoming more and more vacant and abstract,  and not only the Platonic Ideas and the Eleatic Being, but all  abstractions seemed to be at variance with sense and at war with one  another.    The want of the Greek mind in the fourth century before Christ was  not another theory of rest or motion, or Being or atoms, but rather a  philosophy which could free the mind from the power of abstractions  and alternatives, and show how far rest and how far motion, how far the  universal principle of Being and the multitudinous principle of atoms,  entered into the composition of the world; which could distinguish  between the true and false analogy, and allow the negative as well as  the positive a place in human thought. To such a philosophy Plato, in  the Theaetetus, offers many contributions. He has followed philosophy  into the region of mythology, and pointed out the similarities of  opposing phases of thought. He has also shown that extreme abstractions  are self-destructive, and, indeed, hardly distinguishable from one  another. But his intention is not to unravel the whole subject of  knowledge, if this had been possible; and several times in the course  of the dialogue he rejects explanations of knowledge which have germs of  truth in them; as, for example, 'the resolution of the compound into the  simple;' or 'right opinion with a mark of difference.'    ...    Terpsion, who has come to Megara from the country, is described as  having looked in vain for Euclides in the Agora; the latter explains  that he has been down to the harbour, and on his way thither had met  Theaetetus, who was being carried up from the army to Athens. He was  scarcely alive, for he had been badly wounded at the battle of Corinth,  and had taken the dysentery which prevailed in the camp. The mention of  his condition suggests the reflection, 'What a loss he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17262"],[0,"Catalogue Of Linguistic Manuscripts In The Library Of The Bureau Of Ethnology.
