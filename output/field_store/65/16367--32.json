Probably my dream of last night satisfies the requirements.  Its content, fixed immediately after awakening, runs as follows:    _\"Company; at table or table d'hote.... Spinach is served. Mrs. E.L.,  sitting next to me, gives me her undivided attention, and places her  hand familiarly upon my knee. In defence I remove her hand. Then she  says: 'But you have always had such beautiful eyes.'.... I then  distinctly see something like two eyes as a sketch or as the contour of  a spectacle lens....\"_    This is the whole dream, or, at all events, all that I can remember. It  appears to me not only obscure and meaningless, but more especially odd.  Mrs. E.L. is a person with whom I am scarcely on visiting terms, nor to  my knowledge have I ever desired any more cordial relationship. I have  not seen her for a long time, and do not think there was any mention of  her recently. No emotion whatever accompanied the dream process.    Reflecting upon this dream does not make it a bit clearer to my mind. I  will now, however, present the ideas, without premeditation and without  criticism, which introspection yielded. I soon notice that it is an  advantage to break up the dream into its elements, and to search out the  ideas which link themselves to each fragment.    _Company; at table or table d'hote._ The recollection of the slight  event with which the evening of yesterday ended is at once called up. I  left a small party in the company of a friend, who offered to drive me  home in his cab. \"I prefer a taxi,\" he said; \"that gives one such a  pleasant occupation; there is always something to look at.\" When we were  in the cab, and the cab-driver turned the disc so that the first sixty  hellers were visible, I continued the jest. \"We have hardly got in and  we already owe sixty hellers. The taxi always reminds me of the table  d'hote. It makes me avaricious and selfish by continuously reminding me  of my debt. It seems to me to mount up too quickly, and I am always  afraid that I shall be at a disadvantage, just as I cannot resist at  table d'hote the comical fear that I am getting too little, that I must  look after myself.\" In far-fetched connection with this I quote:      \"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,    To guilt ye let us heedless go.\"    Another idea about the table d'hote. A few weeks ago I was very cross  with my dear wife at the dinner-table at a Tyrolese health resort,  because she was not sufficiently reserved with some neighbors with whom  I wished to have absolutely nothing to do. I begged her to occupy  herself rather with me than with the strangers. That is just as if I had  _been at a disadvantage at the table d'hote_. The contrast between the  behavior of my wife at the table and that of Mrs. E.L. in the dream now  strikes me: _\"Addresses herself entirely to me.\"_    Further, I now notice that the dream is the reproduction of a little  scene which transpired between my wife and myself when I was secretly  courting her. The caressing under cover of the tablecloth was an answer  to a wooer's passionate letter. In the dream, however, my wife is  replaced by the unfamiliar E.L.    Mrs. E.L. is the daughter of a man to whom I _owed money_! I cannot help  noticing that here there is revealed an unsuspected connection between  the dream content and my thoughts. If the chain of associations be  followed up which proceeds from one element of the dream one is soon led  back to another of its elements. The thoughts evoked by the dream stir  up associations which were not noticeable in the dream itself.    Is it not customary, when some one expects others to look after his  interests without any advantage to themselves, to ask the innocent  question satirically: \"Do you think this will be done _for the sake of  your beautiful eyes_?\" Hence Mrs. E.L.'s speech in the dream. \"You have  always had such beautiful eyes,\" means nothing but \"people always do  everything to you for love of you; you have had _everything for  nothing_.\" The contrary is, of course, the truth; I have always paid  dearly for whatever kindness others have shown me. Still, the fact that  _I had a ride for nothing_ yesterday when my friend drove me home in his  cab must have made an impression upon me.    In any case, the friend whose guests we were yesterday has often made me  his debtor. Recently I allowed an opportunity of requiting him to go by.  He has had only one present from me, an antique shawl, upon which eyes  are painted all round, a so-called Occhiale, as a _charm_ against the  _Malocchio_. Moreover, he is an _eye specialist_. That same evening I  had asked him after a patient whom I had sent to him for _glasses_.    As I remarked, nearly all parts of the dream have been brought into this  new connection. I still might ask why in the dream it was _spinach_  that was served up. Because spinach called up a little scene which  recently occurred at our table. A child, whose _beautiful eyes_ are  really deserving of praise, refused to eat spinach. As a child I was  just the same; for a long time I loathed _spinach_, until in later life  my tastes altered, and it became one of my favorite dishes. The mention  of this dish brings my own childhood and that of my child's near  together. \"You should be glad that you have some spinach,\" his mother  had said to the little gourmet. \"Some children would be very glad to get  spinach.\" Thus I am reminded of the parents' duties towards their  children. Goethe's words--      \"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,    To guilt ye let us heedless go\"--    take on another meaning in this connection.    Here I will stop in order that I may recapitulate the results of the  analysis of the dream. By following the associations which were linked  to the single elements of the dream torn from their context, I have been  led to a series of thoughts and reminiscences where I am bound to  recognize interesting expressions of my psychical life. The matter  yielded by an analysis of the dream stands in intimate relationship with  the dream content, but this relationship is so special that I should  never have been able to have inferred the new discoveries directly from  the dream itself. The dream was passionless, disconnected, and  unintelligible. During the time that I am unfolding the thoughts at the  back of the dream I feel intense and well-grounded emotions. The  thoughts themselves fit beautifully together into chains logically bound  together with certain central ideas which ever repeat themselves. Such  ideas not represented in the dream itself are in this instance the  antitheses _selfish, unselfish, to be indebted, to work for nothing_. I  could draw closer the threads of the web which analysis has disclosed,  and would then be able to show how they all run together into a single  knot; I am debarred from making this work public by considerations of a  private, not of a scientific, nature. After having cleared up many  things which I do not willingly acknowledge as mine, I should have much  to reveal which had better remain my secret. Why, then, do not I choose  another dream whose analysis would be more suitable for publication, so  that I could awaken a fairer conviction of the sense and cohesion of the  results disclosed by analysis? The answer is, because every dream which  I investigate leads to the same difficulties and places me under the  same need of discretion; nor should I forgo this difficulty any the  more were I to analyze the dream of some one else. That could only be  done when opportunity allowed all concealment to be dropped without  injury to those who trusted me.    The conclusion which is now forced upon me is that the dream is a _sort  of substitution_ for those emotional and intellectual trains of thought  which I attained after complete analysis. I do not yet know the process  by which the dream arose from those thoughts, but I perceive that it is  wrong to regard the dream as psychically unimportant, a purely physical  process which has arisen from the activity of isolated cortical elements  awakened out of sleep.    I must further remark that the dream is far shorter than the thoughts  which I hold it replaces; whilst analysis discovered that the dream was  provoked by an unimportant occurrence the evening before the dream.    Naturally, I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions if only one  analysis were known to me. Experience has shown me that when the  associations of any dream are honestly followed such a chain of thought  is revealed, the constituent parts of the dream reappear correctly and  sensibly linked together; the slight suspicion that this concatenation  was merely an accident of a single first observation must, therefore,  be absolutely relinquished. I regard it, therefore, as my right to  establish this new view by a proper nomenclature. I contrast the dream  which my memory evokes with the dream and other added matter revealed by  analysis: the former I call the dream's _manifest content_; the latter,  without at first further subdivision, its _latent content_. I arrive at  two new problems hitherto unformulated: (1) What is the psychical  process which has transformed the latent content of the dream into its  manifest content? (2) What is the motive or the motives which have made  such transformation exigent? The process by which the change from latent  to manifest content is executed I name the _dream-work_. In contrast  with this is the _work of analysis_, which produces the reverse  transformation. The other problems of the dream--the inquiry as to its  stimuli, as to the source of its materials, as to its possible purpose,  the function of dreaming, the forgetting of dreams--these I will discuss  in connection with the latent dream-content.    I shall take every care to avoid a confusion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#3)"],[1," power, wisdom, and majesty  of God when the conscience is in turmoil over sin. To do so is to lose  God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure  and to comprehend His infinite majesty.    We are to seek God as Paul tells us in I Corinthians 1:23, 24: \"We  preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto  the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and  Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\" Begin with  Christ. He came down to earth, lived among men, suffered, was crucified,  and then He died, standing clearly before us, so that our hearts and  eyes may fasten upon Him. Thus we shall be kept from climbing into  heaven in a curious and futile search after the nature of God.    If you ask how God may be found, who justifies sinners, know that there  is no other God besides this man Christ Jesus. Embrace Him, and forget  about the nature of God. But these fanatics who exclude our Mediator in  their dealings with God, do not believe me. Did not Christ Himself  say: \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the  Father, but by me\"? Without Christ there is no access to the Father, but  futile rambling; no truth, but hypocrisy; no life, but eternal death.    When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of  justification, you may be as profound as you like. But when you deal  with conscience and with righteousness over against the law, sin, death,  and the devil, you must close your mind to all inquiries into the nature  of God, and concentrate upon Jesus Christ, who says, \"Come unto me,  all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" Doing  this, you will recognize the power, and majesty condescending to your  condition according to Paul's statement to the Colossians, \"In Christ  are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,\" and, \"In him  dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\" Paul in wishing grace  and peace not alone from God the Father, but also from Jesus Christ,  wants to warn us against the curious incursions into the nature of  God. We are to hear Christ, who has been appointed by the Father as our  divine Teacher.                               Christ is God by Nature    At the same time, Paul confirms our creed, \"that Christ is very God.\" We  need such frequent confirmation of our faith, for Satan will not fail  to attack it. He hates our faith. He knows that it is the victory which  overcometh him and the world. That Christ is very God is apparent in  that Paul ascribes to Him divine powers equally with the Father, as for  instance, the power to dispense grace and peace. This Jesus could not do  unless He were God.    To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can  create these blessings. The angels cannot. The apostles could  only distribute these blessings by the preaching of the Gospel. In  attributing to Christ the divine power of creating and giving grace,  peace, everlasting life, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins, the  conclusion is inevitable that Christ is truly God. Similarly, St. John  concludes from the works attributed to the Father and the Son that they  are divinely One. Hence, the gifts which we receive from the Father and  from the Son are one and the same. Otherwise Paul should have written:  \"Grace from God the Father, and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ.\" In  combining them he ascribes them equally to the Father and the Son. I  stress this on account of the many errors emanating from the sects.    The Arians were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two natures,  and that He is called \"very God of very God,\" they were yet able to deny  His divinity. The Arians took Christ for a noble and perfect creature,  superior even to the angels, because by Him God created heaven and  earth. Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ. But all their praise is  mere palaver to deceive men. Paul's language is different. To paraphrase  him: \"You are established in this belief that Christ is very God because  He gives grace and peace, gifts which only God can create and bestow.\"        VERSE 4. Who gave himself for our sins.    Paul sticks to his theme. He never loses sight of the purpose of his  epistle. He does not say, \"Who received our works,\" but \"who gave.\" Gave  what? Not gold, or silver, or paschal lambs, or an angel, but Himself.  What for? Not for a crown, or a kingdom, or our goodness, but for our  sins. These words are like so many thunderclaps of protest from heaven  against every kind and type of self-merit. Underscore these words, for  they are full of comfort for sore consciences.    How may we obtain remission of our sins? Paul answers: \"The man who is  named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave himself for our sins.\"  The heavy artillery of these words explodes papacy, works, merits,  superstitions. For if our sins could be removed by our own efforts, what  need was there for the Son of God to be given for them? Since Christ was  given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by  our own efforts.    This sentence also defines our sins as great, so great, in fact, that  the whole world could not make amends for a single sin. The greatness  of the ransom, Christ, the Son of God, indicates this. The vicious  character of sin is brought out by the words \"who gave himself for our  sins.\" So vicious is sin that only the sacrifice of Christ could atone  for sin. When we reflect that the one little word \"sin\" embraces  the whole kingdom of Satan, and that it includes everything that is  horrible, we have reason to tremble. But we are careless. We make light  of sin. We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.    This passage, then, bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin.  Sin is an exacting despot who can be vanquished by no created power, but  by the sovereign power of Jesus Christ alone.    All this is of wonderful comfort to a conscience troubled by the  enormity of sin. Sin cannot harm those who believe in Christ, because  He has overcome sin by His death. Armed with this conviction, we  are enlightened and may pass judgment upon the papists, monks, nuns,  priests, Mohammedans, Anabaptists, and all who trust in their own  merits, as wicked and destructive sects that rob God and Christ of the  honor that belongs to them alone.    Note especially the pronoun \"our\" and its significance. You will readily  grant that Christ gave Himself for the sins of Peter, Paul, and others  who were worthy of such grace. But feeling low, you find it hard to  believe that Christ gave Himself for your sins. Our feelings shy at  a personal application of the pronoun \"our\" and we refuse to have  anything to do with God until we have made ourselves worthy by good  deeds.    This attitude springs from a false conception of sin, the conception  that sin is a small matter, easily taken care of by good works; that  we must present ourselves unto God with a good conscience; that we must  feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sins.    This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who  consider themselves better than others. Such readily confess that  they are frequent sinners, but they regard their sins as of no such  importance that they cannot easily be dissolved by some good action, or  that they may not appear before the tribunal of Christ and demand the  reward of eternal life for their righteousness. Meantime they pretend  great humility and acknowledge a certain degree of sinfulness for which  they soulfully join in the publican's prayer, \"God be merciful to me  a sinner.\" But the real significance and comfort of the words \"for our  sins\" is lost upon them.    The genius of Christianity takes the words of Paul \"who gave himself for  our sins\" as true and efficacious. We are not to look upon our sins as  insignificant trifles. On the other hand, we are not to regard them  as so terrible that we must despair. Learn to believe that Christ  was given, not for picayune and imaginary transgressions, but for  mountainous sins; not for one or two, but for all; not for sins that can  be discarded, but for sins that are stubbornly ingrained.    Practice this knowledge and fortify yourself against despair,  particularly in the last hour, when the memory of past sins assails the  conscience. Say with confidence: \"Christ, the Son of God, was given not  for the righteous, but for sinners. If I had no sin I should not need  Christ. No, Satan, you cannot delude me into thinking I am holy. The  truth is, I am all sin. My sins are not imaginary transgressions,  but sins against the first table, unbelief, doubt, despair, contempt,  hatred, ignorance of God, ingratitude towards Him, misuse of His name,  neglect of His Word, etc.; and sins against the second table,  dishonor of parents, disobedience of government, coveting of another's  possessions, etc. Granted that I have not committed murder, adultery,  theft, and similar sins in deed, nevertheless I have committed them in  the heart, and therefore I am a transgressor of all the commandments of  God.    \"Because my transgressions are multiplied and my own efforts at  self-justification rather a hindrance than a furtherance, therefore  Christ the Son of God gave Himself into death for my sins.\" To believe  this is to have eternal life.    Let us equip ourselves against the accusations of Satan with this and  similar passages of Holy Scripture. If he says, \"Thou shalt be damned,\"  you tell him: \"No, for I fly to Christ who gave Himself for my sins. In  accusing me of being a damnable sinner, you are cutting your own throat,  Satan. You are reminding me of God's fatherly goodness toward me, that  He so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son that whosoever  believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. In  calling me a sinner, Satan, you really comfort me above measure.\" With  such"]]]
