Here all a forest seemed; there open groves,    With vine-clad trees, vines hanging from each limb,    A pendant chain of bloom, with shaded drives    And walks, with rustic seats, cool grots and dells,    With fountains playing and with babbling brooks,    And stately swans sailing on little lakes,    While peacocks, rainbow-tinted shrikes, pheasants,    Glittering like precious stones, parrots, and birds    Of all rich plumage, fly from tree to tree,    The whole scene vocal with sweet varied song;    And here a widespread lawn bedecked with flowers,    With clumps of brilliant roses grown to trees,    And fields with dahlias spread,[4] not stiff and prim    Like the starched ruffle of an ancient dame,    But growing in luxuriance rich and wild,    The colors of the evening and the rainbow joined,    White, scarlet, yellow, crimson, deep maroon,    Blending all colors in one dazzling blaze;    There orchards bend beneath their luscious loads;    Here vineyards climb the hills thick set with grapes;    There rolling pastures spread, where royal mares,    High bred, and colts too young for bit or spur,    Now quiet feed, then, as at trumpet's call,    With lion bounds, tails floating, neck outstretched,[5]    Nostrils distended, fleet as the flying wind    They skim the plain, and sweep in circles wide--    Nature's Olympic, copied, ne'er excelled.    Here, deer with dappled fawn bound o'er the grass,[6]    And sacred herds, and sheep with skipping lambs;    There, great white elephants in quiet nooks;    While high on cliffs framed in with living green    Goats climb and seem to hang and feed in air--    Sweet spot, with all to please and nothing to offend.      Here on a hill the royal palace stood,    A gem of art; and near, another hill,    Its top crowned by an aged banyan tree,    Its sides clad in strange jyotismati grass,[7]    By day a sober brown, but in the night    Glowing as if the hill were all aflame--    Twin wonders to the dwellers in the plain,    Their guides and landmarks day and night,    This glittering palace and this glowing hill.    Within, above the palace rose a tower,    Which memory knew but as the ancient tower,    Foursquare and high, an altar and a shrine    On its broad top, where burned perpetual fire,    Emblem of boundless and eternal love    And truth that knows no night, no cloud, no change,    Long since gone out, with that most ancient faith    In one great Father, source of life and light.[8]    Still round this ancient tower, strange hopes and fears,    And memories handed down from sire to son,    Were clustered thick.  An army, old men say,    Once camped against the city, when strange lights    Burst from this tower, blinding their dazzled eyes.    They fled amazed, nor dared to look behind.    The people bloody war and cruel bondage saw    On every side, and they at peace and free,    And thought a power to save dwelt in that tower.    And now strange prophecies and sayings old    Were everywhere rehearsed, that from this hill    Should come a king or savior of the world.    Even the poor dwellers in the distant plain    Looked up; they too had heard that hence should come    One quick to hear the poor and strong to save.    And who shall dare to chide their simple faith?    This humble reverence for the great unknown    Brings men near God, and opens unseen worlds,    Whence comes all life, and where all power doth dwell.      Morning and evening on this tower the king,    Before the rising and the setting sun,    Blindly, but in his father's faith, bowed down.    Then he would rise and on his kingdom gaze.    East, west, hills beyond hills stretched far away,    Wooded, terraced, or bleak and bald and bare,    Till in dim distance all were leveled lost.    One rich and varied carpet spread far south,    Of fields, of groves, of busy cities wrought,    With mighty rivers seeming silver threads;    And to the north the Himalayan chain,    Peak beyond peak, a wall of crest and crag,    Ice bound, snow capped, backed by intensest blue,    Untrod, immense, that, like a crystal wall.    In myriad varied tints the glorious light    Of rising and of setting sun reflects;    His noble city lying at his feet,    And his broad park, tinged by the sun's slant rays    A thousand softly rich and varied shades.      Still on this scene of grandeur, plenty, peace    And ever-varying beauty, he would gaze    With sadness.  He had heard these prophecies,    And felt the unrest in that great world within,    Hid from our blinded eyes, yet ever near,    The very soul and life of this dead world,    Which seers and prophets open-eyed have seen,    On which the dying often raptured gaze,    And where they live when they are mourned as dead.    This world was now astir, foretelling day.    \"A king shall come, they say, to rule the world,    If he will rule; but whence this mighty king?    My years decline apace, and yet no son    Of mine to rule or light my funeral pile.\"      One night Queen Maya, sleeping by her lord,    Dreamed a strange dream; she dreamed she saw a star    Gliding from heaven and resting over her;    She dreamed she heard strange music, soft and sweet,    So distant \"joy and peace\" was all she heard.    In joy and peace she wakes, and waits to know    What this strange dream might mean, and whence it came.      Drums, shells and trumpets sound for joy, not war;    The streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes,    And myriad lamps shine from each house and tree,    And myriad flags flutter in every breeze,    And children crowned with flowers dance in the streets,    And all keep universal holiday    With shows and games, and laugh and dance and song,    For to the gentle queen a son is born,    To King Suddhodana the good an heir.      But scarcely had these myriad lamps gone out,    The sounds of revelry had scarcely died,    When coming from the palace in hot haste,    One cried, \"Maya, the gentle queen, is dead.\"    Then mirth was changed to sadness, joy to grief,    For all had learned to love the gentle queen--    But at Siddartha's birth this was foretold.      Among the strangers bringing gifts from far,    There came an ancient sage--whence, no one knew--    Age-bowed, head like the snow, eyes filmed and white,    So deaf the thunder scarcely startled him,    Who met them, as they said, three journeys back,    And all his talk was of a new-born king,    Just born, to rule the world if he would rule.    He was so gentle, seemed so wondrous wise,    They followed him, he following, he said,    A light they could not see; and when encamped,    Morn, noon and night devoutly would he pray,    And then would talk for hours, as friend to friend,    With questionings about this new-born king,    Gazing intently at the tent's blank wall,    With nods and smiles, as if he saw and heard,    While they sit lost in wonder, as one sits    Who never saw a telephone, but hears    Unanswered questions, laughter at unheard jests,    And sees one bid a little box good-by.    And when they came before the king, they saw,    Laughing and cooing on its mother's knee,    Picture of innocence, a sweet young child;    He saw a mighty prophet, and bowed down    Eight times in reverence to the very ground,    And rising said, \"Thrice happy house, all hail!    This child would rule the world, if he would rule,    But he, too good to rule, is born to save;    But Maya's work is done, the devas wait.\"    But when they sought for him, the sage was gone,    Whence come or whither gone none ever knew.    Then gentle Maya understood her dream.    The music nearer, clearer sounds; she sleeps.    But when the funeral pile was raised for her,    Of aloe, sandal, and all fragrant woods,    And decked with flowers and rich with rare perfumes,    And when the queen was gently laid thereon,    As in sweet sleep, and the pile set aflame,    The king cried out in anguish; when the sage    Again appeared, and gently said, \"Weep not!    Seek not, O king, the living with the dead!    'Tis but her cast-off garment, not herself,    That now dissolves in air.  Thy loved one lives,    Become thy deva,[9] who was erst thy queen.\"    This said, he vanished, and was no more seen.      Now other hands take up that mother's task.    Another breast nurses that sweet young child    With growing love; for who can nurse a child,    Feel its warm breath, and little dimpled hands,    Kiss its soft lips, look in its laughing eyes,    Hear its low-cooing love-notes soft and sweet,    And not feel something of that miracle,    A mother's love--so old yet ever new,    Stronger than death, bravest among the brave,    Gentle as brave, watchful both night and day,    That never changes, never tires nor sleeps.    Whence comes this wondrous and undying love?    Whence can it come, unless it comes from heaven,    Whose life is love--eternal, perfect love!      From babe to boy, from boy to youth he grew,    But more in grace and knowledge than in years.    At play his joyous laugh rang loud and clear,    His foot was fleetest in all boyish games,    And strong his arm, and steady nerve and eye,    To whirl the quoit and send the arrow home;    Yet seeming oft to strive, he'd check his speed    And miss his mark to let a comrade win.    In fullness of young life he climbed the cliffs    Where human foot had never trod before.    He led the chase, but when soft-eyed gazelles    Or bounding deer, or any harmless thing,    Came in the range of his unerring dart,    He let them pass; for why, thought he, should men    In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#3)"],[1,"by labour, intelligence,  and capital in the prairie lands of Argentina. First, let us note the  developments on those wonderful tracts of splendid prairie lands lying  between the River Plate and the Andes: fifty years ago these lands were  of little account, and only a few cattle were to be found roaming about  them, but upon the advance of the railway they came under the plough,  and, without much attention or care, produced wheat and maize. After a  time improvements in the method of cultivation produced a better return,  and to-day a great deal of attention is paid to the preparing of the  land, and thought and care are given to the seed time, the growing, and  the harvest. When it is found desirable to rest the land after crops of  wheat and maize, etc., alfalfa is grown thereon. Alfalfa is one of the  clover tribe, and has the peculiar property of attaching to itself those  micro-organisms which are able to fix the nitrogen in the air and render  it available for plant food. Every colonist knows the value of alfalfa  for feeding his animals, but it is not every colonist who knows why this  plant occupies such a high place amongst feeding stuffs. Alfalfa is  easily grown, very strong when established, and, provided its roots can  get to water, will go on growing for years. The _raison d'etre_ for  growing alfalfa is for the feeding of cattle and preparing them for  market, and for this purpose a league of alfalfa (6,177 acres metric  measurement) will carry on an average 3,500 head. When grown for dry  fodder it produces three or four crops per annum and a fair yield is  from 6 to 8 tons per acre of dry alfalfa for each year. A ton of such  hay is worth about $20 to $30, and after deducting expenses there is a  clear return of about $14 per acre.    The figures supplied by one large company are interesting; they show  that, on an average, cattle, when placed upon alfalfa lands, improve in  value at the rate of $2.00 per head per month, so it is easy to place a  value on its feeding properties. Thus, we will take a camp under alfalfa  capable of carrying 10,000 head of cattle all the year round, where as  the fattened animals are sold off an equal number is bought to replace  them. Such a camp would bring in a clear profit of $200,000 per annum,  and the property should be worth L175,000 sterling. An animal that has  been kept all its life on rough camp, and, when too old for breeding, is  placed for the first time on alfalfa lands, fattens extremely quickly,  and the meat is tender and in quality compares favourably with any other  beef. No business in Argentina of the same importance has shown such  good returns as cattle breeding, and these results have been chiefly  brought about by the introduction of alfalfa, and a knowledge of the  life history of alfalfa is of the greatest importance to the cattle  farmer. All cereal crops take from the soil mineral matter and nitrogen.  Therefore, after continuous cropping the land becomes exhausted and  generally poorer; experience has taught us that rotation of crops is a  necessity to alleviate the strain on the soil, and such an axiom has  this become that in many cases English landlords insist that their  leases shall contain a clause binding the tenants to grow certain stated  crops in rotation.    This system is known in England as the four-course shift. Knowledge  gained by successive generations of observant farmers has given us the  key to what Nature had hitherto kept to herself, and to-day we know why  the plan adopted by our forefathers was right, and why the rotation of  crops was, and is, a necessity. Men of science are devoting their lives  to the systematic study of Nature's hidden secrets, and by means of  Agricultural Colleges, as well as private individual research, these  discoveries are being given to mankind, and long before the soils of  Argentina show any serious loss of nitrogen from continuous cropping,  science will probably have established means of applying in a practical  manner those methods already known of propagating the  nitrogen-collecting bacteria which thrive on alfalfa, clover, peas, soya  beans, and other leguminous plants. Almost every country is now devoting  time, money, and energy to agricultural research work. In 1908 the  Agricultural College at Ontario prepared no less than 474 packages of  Legume Bacteria, and in 309 cases beneficial results followed from the  application thereof to the soil; in 165 cases no improvements in the  crops were noticed, this may, however, have been due to the want of  knowledge of how to manipulate the bacteria, or to lack of experience in  noting effects scientifically, but in any case the experiment must be  considered successful when the results obtained were satisfactory in no  less than 65 per cent. of the trials. No greater factor exists than the  microscope in opening up and hunting out the secrets concealed in the  very soil we are standing on.    If soils were composed of nothing but pure silica sand, nothing would  ever grow; but in Nature we find that soils contain all sorts of mineral  matter, and chief amongst these is lime.    Alfalfa thrives on land which contains lime, and gives but poor results  where this ingredient is deficient. The explanation is simple. There is  a community of interest between the very low microscopic animal life,  known as bacteria, and plant life generally. In every ounce of soil  there are millions of these living germs which have their allotted work  to do, and they thrive best in soils containing lime.    If one digs up with great care a root of alfalfa (it need not be an old  plant, the youngest plant will show the same peculiarity), and care is  taken in exposing the root (perhaps the best method is the washing away  of the surrounding earth by water), some small nodules attached to the  fine, hair-like roots are easily distinguished by the naked eye, and  these nodules are the home of a teeming, microscopical, industrious  population, who perform their allotted work with the silent, persistent  energy so often displayed in Nature. Men of science have been able to  identify at least three classes of these bacteria, and to ascertain the  work accomplished by each. The reason for their existence would seem to  be that one class is able to convert the nitrogen in the air into  ammonia, whilst others work it into nitrite, and the third class so  manipulate it as to form a nitrate which is capable of being used for  plant food.    Now, although one ton of alfalfa removes from the soil 50 lb. of  nitrogen, yet that crop leaves the soil richer in nitrogen, because the  alfalfa has encouraged the multiplication of those factories which  convert some of the thousands of tons of nitrogen floating above the  earth into substance suitable for food for plant life. As a dry fodder  for cattle three tons of alfalfa contains as much nutrition as two tons  of wheat.    The cost of growing alfalfa greatly depends upon the situation of the  land to be dealt with; also upon whether labour is plentiful or not;  but, in order to give some idea of the advantage of growing this cattle  food, we will imagine the intrinsic value of the undeveloped land to be  L4,000, upon which, under existing conditions, it would be possible to  keep 1,000 head of animals, whereas if this same land were under alfalfa  3,000 to 3,500 animals would be fattened thereon, and the land would  have increased in value to L20,000 or L30,000.    Now, if the undeveloped land is to be improved, it becomes necessary  either to work it yourself, with your own men, in which case you must  provide ploughs, horses, bullocks, etc., or to carry out the plan  usually adopted, that of letting the land to colonists who have had some  experience in this class of work. Usually a colonist will undertake to  cultivate from 500 to 600 acres, and agrees to pay to the landowner  anything from 10 per cent. to 30 per cent. of his crops according to the  distance of the land from the railway. The colonist brings his  agricultural tackle along with him, and establishes his house (usually a  most primitive affair), digs his well, and then proceeds to plough. In  this work the whole family joins; the father leads the way, followed by  the eldest child, and all the others in rotation, with the wife bringing  up the rear; she keeps a maternal eye upon the little mite, who with  great gusto and terrific yells manages somehow to cling to the plough  and to do his or her share with the rest. Is it to be wondered at that  work progresses fast under these conditions? There is but one idea  prevalent in the family, namely, that time and opportunity are with  them.    The first crop grown on newly-broken ground is usually maize; the second  year's crop is linseed, and perhaps a third year's crop--probably  wheat--is grown by the colonist before the land is handed back to the  owner ready to be put down in alfalfa. The colonist's cultivation of the  land will have effectually killed off the natural rough grasses which  would otherwise grow up and choke the alfalfa. Sometimes the alfalfa is  sown with the colonist's last crop, and in such cases the landowner  finds the alfalfa seed, and during the sowing of this crop it is very  advisable that either he or his agent should be in constant attendance,  because the after results greatly depend upon the care with which the  seeding has been done. When the colonist's contract is completed he  moves on to another part, and the owner, who has year by year received a  percentage of the crops, takes back his land. Considerable outlay has  now to be made in fences, wells, and buildings; the more there are of  these the better, the land will carry a larger head of cattle and the  control of them is easy when the camp has been properly divided.    The colonists are generally Italians. They are an industrious and kindly  people, hardy and quiet, well content with their surroundings,"]]]
