Not only so,  but the prisms could be detached with great ease, by using no  instrument more violent than the fingers; while the point of a thin  knife entered freely at any of the surface lines, and split the ice  neatly down the sides of the prisms. When one or two of the sides of a  prism were exposed, at the edge of the piece of ice, the prism could  be pushed out entire, like a knot from the edge of a piece of wood. In  some cases there seemed to be capillary fissures coincident with the  lines where several sides of prisms met. Considering the shape of the  whole column, it is clear that the two ends of each prism could not be  parallel; neither was one of the ends perfectly symmetrical with the  other, and I do not think that the prisms were of the nature of  truncated pyramids. On descending again, I found that the columns  were without exception formed of this prismatic ice, either in whole,  as in the clear column, or in part, as where limpid prisms existed  among the white ice which ran in veins down the cascades. In the free  vertical column the prisms seemed to be deposited horizontally, and in  the thicker parts they did not pass clear through. We carried a large  piece of ice down to Arzier in a botanical tin, and on our arrival  there we found that all traces of external lines had disappeared.    This visit to the glaciere was on Saturday, and on the following Monday  I determined to go up alone, to take a registering thermometer, and  leave it in the cave for the night; which, of course, would entail a  third visit on the next day. Monday brought a steady penetrating rain,  of that peculiar character which six Scotch springs had taught me to  describe as 'just a bit must;' while in the higher regions the fog was  so hopeless, that a sudden lift of the mist revealed the unpleasant fact  that considerable progress had been made in a westerly direction, the  true line being north-west. Instead of the rocks of La Genolliere, the  foreground presented was the base of the Dole, and the chasm which  affords a passage from the well-known fortress of Les Rousses into Vaud.  There was nothing for it but to turn in the right direction, or attempt  to do so, and force a way through the wet woods till something should  turn up. This something took the form of a chalet; but no amount of  hammering and shouting produced any response, and it was only after a  forcible entrance, and a prolonged course of interior shouting, that a  man was at length drawn. He said that he had been asleep--and why he  put it in a past tense is still a mystery--and could give no idea of  the direction of the chalet on La Genolliere, beyond a vague suggestion  that it was somewhere in the mist; a suggestion by no means improbable,  seeing that the mist was ubiquitous. One piece of information he was  able to give, and it was consoling: I was now, it seemed, on the  Fruitiere de Nyon, and therefore the desired chalet could not be far  off, if only a guide could be found. On the whole, he thought that a  guide could not be found; but there were men in the chalet, and I might  go up the ladder with him and see what could be done. He led to a  chamber with a window of one small pane, dating apparently from the  first invention of glass, and never cleaned since. An invisible corner  of the room was appealed to; but the voice which resided there, and  seemed like everything else to be asleep, pleaded dreamily a total  ignorance of the whereabouts of the chalet in question. Just as, by dint  of steady staring through the darkness, an indistinct form of a  mattress, with a human being reclining thereon, began to be visible,  another dark corner announced that this new speaker had heard of a  _p'tit sentier_ leading to the chalet, but knew neither direction nor  distance. Here the space between the two corners put in a word; and, as  the darkness was now becoming natural, seven or eight mattresses  appeared, ranged round the room, some holding one, some two men, most of  whom were sitting up on end with old caps on, displaying every variety  of squalor. The voice which had spoken last declared that the distance  was three-quarters of an hour, and that if the day were clear there  would be no difficulty in reaching the chalet; as it was, the man would  be very glad to try.    A change of cap was the only dressing necessary for the volunteer, and  we faced the fog and rain, which elicited from him such a disgraceful  amount of swearing, that it was on all accounts well when the rain  ceased for a few minutes, the mists rolled off, and the clouds lifted  sufficiently to betray the surface of the Lake of Geneva, luxuriating in  the clear warmth of an early summer's day, and making us shiver by the  painful contrast which our own altitude presented. The deep blue of the  lake brought to mind the story of the shepherd of Gessenay (Saanen), of  whom it is told that when he was passing the hills with some friends for  a first visit to Vevey, and came in sight of the lake, which he had  never seen before, he turned and hurried home incontinent, declaring  that he would not enter a country where the good God had made the blue  sky to fall and fill the valleys.    In this bright interval we came upon a magnificent fox, and the  peasant's impulse was, 'Oh, for a good gun!' an exclamation which would  have sounded horrible to English ears, if I had not been previously  broken in to it by an invitation from a Scotch gamekeeper to a fox-hunt,  when he promised an excellent gun, and a _stance_ which the foxes were  sure to pass.    The rain now came on again, and the guide thought he had had plenty of  it, and must return for the afternoon milking; and just then, as good  luck would have it, we stumbled upon an immense clump of nettles which  had been one of our landmarks two days before, so that he was no longer  necessary, and we said affectionate adieux.    The glaciere was in a state of ruin. Only the right-hand column, not  speaking heraldically, was standing, the others lying in blocks frozen  hard together on the ground. The column which still stood was much  shrunken, and seemed too small for its fissure, the sides of which it  scarcely touched. The wind blew down the entrance slope so  determinedly, that a candle found it difficult to live at the bottom  of the first cave; and a portion of the current blew into the  glaciere, and in its sweep exactly struck the fallen columns, the  edges of which were already rounded by thaw. Much of this must be  attributed to the recent opening of the second shaft (p. 5), which  admits a thorough draught through the first cave, and so exposes the  glaciere to currents of warmer air; and I should expect to find that  in future the ice will disappear from that part of the cave every  summer, [7] whereas in 1861 we found it thick and dry (excepting a few  small basins containing water) and evidently permanent, in the middle  of a very hot August. The low part of the cave was so completely  protected from the current, that the candle burned there quite  steadily for an hour and a half: still, like the others, the column at  that end of the glaciere was broken down, and it therefore became  necessary to attribute its fall to some other agency than the current  of external air. There had been a very large amount of rain, and the  surface of the rock in the fissures was evidently wet; so I have no  doubt that the filtering through of the warm rain-water had thawed the  upper supports of the ice-cascades, and then, owing to their slightly  inclined position, the pedestal had not provided sufficient support,  and so they had fallen. One of them, perhaps, had brought down in its  fall the free column, which had stood two days before on its own base,  without any support from the rock. Very probably, too--indeed, almost  certainly,--the fall of the large mass of rock, which once formed the  bottom of the basin on the north side of the road, has affected the  old-established fissures, by which rain-water has been accustomed to  penetrate in small quantities to the glaciere, so that now a much  larger amount is admitted. On this account, there will probably be a  great diminution of the ice in the course of future summers, though  the amount formed each winter may be greater than it has hitherto  been. Constant examination of other columns and fissures has convinced  me, that, before the end of autumn, the majority of the glacieres will  have lost all the columns which depend upon the roof for a part of  their support, or spring from fissures in the wall; whereas those  which are true stalagmites, and are self-supporting, will have a much  better chance of remaining through the warm season, and lasting till  the winter, and so increasing in size from year to year. Free  stalagmites, however, which are formed under fissures capable of  pouring down a large amount of water on the occasion of a great flood  of rain, must succumb in time, though not so soon as the supported  columns.    A curious appearance was presented by a small free stalagmite in the  retired part of the cave. The surface of the stalagmite was wet, from  the drops proceeding from a fissure above, and was lightly covered in  many parts with a calcareous deposit, brought down from the fissures in  the roof by the water filtering through. The stalagmite was of the  double-edged-sword shape, and the limestone deposit collected chiefly at  one of its edges, the edge nearer to that part of the cave where thaw  prevailed; so that the real edge was a ridge of deposit beyond the edge  of the ice.[8] Patches of limestone paste lay on many parts of the  ice-floor.    In the loftier part of the cave, water dropped from the roof to so  large an extent, that ninety-six drops of water in a minute splashed  on to a small stone immediately under the main fissure. This stone was  in the centre of a considerable area of the floor which was clear of  ice; and it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14015"],[0,"The Discovery of Witches (#3)"],[1,"the Witch, nor the Devill, (onely the  Devill knew that such a disease was predominant) and the witch  aggravates her damnation by her familiarity and consent to the Devill,  and so comes likewise in compass of the Lawes. This is Satans usuall  impostring and deluding, but not his constant course of proceeding,  for he and the witch doe mischiefe too much. But I would that  Magistrates and Jurats would a little examine witnesses when they  heare witches confess such and such a murder, whether the party had  not long time before, or at the time when the witch grew suspected,  some disease or other predominant, which might cause that issue or  effect of death.
