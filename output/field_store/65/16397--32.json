But we repeat that the case is not an appeal from the Commissioner's  findings on causation or other matters. The applicants acknowledge that  they have no rights of appeal. What they attack are certain paragraphs  in the Commission report which deal very largely, not with the causes  and circumstances of the crash, but with what the Commissioner calls  'the stance' of the airline at the inquiry before him. The applicants  say that in these paragraphs the Commissioner exceeded his powers or  acted in breach of natural justice; and further that some of his  conclusions were not supported by any evidence whatever of probative  value. Their counsel submit that a finding made wholly without evidence  capable of supporting it is contrary to natural justice.    The arguments on the other side were presented chiefly by Mr Baragwanath  and Mr Harrison, who had been counsel assisting the Commission and  appeared in this Court for the Attorney-General, not to advance any view  on behalf of the Government but to ensure that nothing that could  possibly be said in answer to the contentions of Mr Brown and Mr  Williams for the applicants was left unsaid before the Court. This was  done because it has not been usual for a person in the position of the  Commissioner to take an active part in litigation concerning his report.  Mr Barton, who appeared for the Commissioner, did not present any  argument, adopting a watching role. He indicated that he would only have  played an active role if the Commissioner had been required for  cross-examination. As already mentioned, it was agreed otherwise. At  that stage the Commissioner, by his counsel, very properly stated that  he would abide the decision of the Court.    Mr Baragwanath's submissions were to the general effect that the Court  had no jurisdiction to interfere with the opinions expressed in the  Commission's report, which were not 'findings' and bound no one; and  that in any event they were conclusions within the Commissioner's  powers, open to him on the evidence and arrived at without any breach of  natural justice.    We now set out the various paragraphs under attack, bearing in mind that  they cannot properly be considered in isolation from the context in the  report. The paragraphs vary in importance, but it is convenient to take  them in the numerical order of the report. We will indicate as regards  each paragraph or set of paragraphs the essence of the complaint. After  doing this we will state how we propose to deal with the complaints.      Destruction of Documents    Paragraphs 45 and 54, which affect particularly the chief executive at  the time of the crash, Morrison Ritchie Davis, are as follows:         45. The reaction of the chief executive was immediate. He       determined that no word of this incredible blunder was to become       publicly known. He directed that all documents relating to       antarctic flights, and to this flight in particular, were to be       collected and impounded. They were all to be put on one single file       which would remain in strict custody. Of these documents all those       which were not directly relevant were to be destroyed. They were to       be put forthwith through the company's shredder.         54. This was at the time the fourth worst disaster in aviation       history, and it follows that this direction on the part of the       chief executive for the destruction of 'irrelevant documents' was       one of the most remarkable executive decisions ever to have been       made in the corporate affairs of a large New Zealand company. There       were personnel in the Flight Operations Division and in the       Navigation Section who anxiously desired to be acquitted of any       responsibility for the disaster. And yet, in consequence of the       chief executive's instructions, it seems to have been left to these       very same officials to determine what documents they would hand       over to the Investigating Committee.    These paragraphs occur in the context of a discussion of the change in  the computer waypoint shortly before the flight and the failure to draw  it to the attention of the flight crew. The reference to the chief  executive having 'determined that no word of this incredible blunder was  to become publicly known' is, taken by itself, at least an  overstatement, because in paragraph 48 the Commissioner in effect  qualifies it. He says there that it was inevitable that the facts would  become known and 'perhaps' the chief executive had only decided to  prevent adverse publicity in the meantime. Clearly the airline disclosed  to the Chief Inspector that the change of more than two degrees of  longitude had been made in the computer early on the day of the flight  and not mentioned to the crew; these matters are referred to in  paragraphs 1.17.7 and 2.5 of the Chief Inspector's report. They were  matters which the Chief Inspector did not highlight; evidently he did  not regard them as of major importance. For his part the Commissioner  (in para. 48 of his report) states that the Chief Inspector did not make  it clear that the computer flight path had been altered before the  flight and the alteration not notified to the crew.    We are not concerned with whether or not the Commissioner's implied  criticism of the Chief Inspector's report is correct. The complaint made  by the applicants is that the criticisms of Mr Davis in the two  paragraphs that we have set out are based on mistake of fact, not on  evidence of probative value. It is also said that he was not given a  fair opportunity to put his case in relation to such findings, but what  the applicants most stress is the way in which the Commissioner dealt  with the evidence.    In particular they point out that the evidence of Mr Davis, not  contradicted by any other evidence and correctly summarised in paragraph  45 of the Commissioner's report, was that only copies of existing  documents were to be destroyed; that he did not want any surplus  document to remain at large in case its contents were released to the  news media by some employee of the airline; and that his instructions  were that all documents of relevance were to be retained on the single  file. Their counsel submit in effect that in converting this direction  for the preservation of all relevant documents into a direction for the  destruction of 'irrelevant' documents--a word used by the Commissioner  as if it were a quotation from Mr Davis--the Commissioner distorted the  evidence. And it is said that the description 'one of the most  remarkable executive decisions every to have been made in the corporate  affairs of a large New Zealand company' is, to say the least,  far-fetched.    Counsel for the applicants point also to the fact that there is no  evidence that any document of importance to the inquiry was destroyed in  consequence of the instructions given by Mr Davis. The gist of the  contrary argument presented by Mr Baragwanath was that Mr Davis was  fully cross-examined about his instructions; and that 'it was open to  the Royal Commissioner to find that there were in existence documents  which never found their way to that file and that the procedures were  tailor made for destruction of compromising documents'.      Alteration of Flight Plan    Paragraph 255 (e) and (f), in numerical order the next passages  complained of, refer to the fact that when the co-ordinates in the  Auckland computer were altered a symbol was used which had the effect  of including in the information to be sent to the United States air  traffic controller at McMurdo Station the word 'McMurdo' instead of the  actual co-ordinates (latitude and longitude) of the southernmost  waypoint. The Commissioner said:         (e) When the TACAN position [a navigational aid at McMurdo Station       enabling aircraft to ascertain their distance from it] was typed       into the airline's ground computer in the early morning of 28       November 1979, there was also made the additional entry to which I       have referred, which would result in the new co-ordinates not being       transmitted to McMurdo with the Air Traffic Control flight plan for       that day. It was urged upon me, on behalf of the airline, that       McMurdo Air Traffic Control would consider the word 'McMurdo' as       indicating a different position from that appearing on Air Traffic       Control flight plans dispatched from Auckland during 1978 and 1979.       I cannot for a moment accept that suggestion. First Officer Rhodes       made a specific inquiry at McMurdo within a few days of the       disaster and ascertained that the destination waypoint of the first       Air Traffic Control flight plan for 1979 had been plotted by the       United States Air Traffic Control personnel, and there was evidence       from the United States witnesses that this would be normal       practice. In my view the word 'McMurdo' would merely be regarded,       and was indeed regarded, by McMurdo Air Traffic Control as       referring to the same McMurdo waypoint which had always existed. In       my opinion, the introduction of the word 'McMurdo' into the Air       Traffic Control flight plan for the fatal flight was deliberately       designed to conceal from the United States authorities that the       flight path had been changed, and probably because it was known       that the United States Air Traffic Control would lodge an objection       to the new flight path.         (f) I have reviewed the evidence in support of the allegation that       the Navigation Section believed, by reason of a mistaken verbal       communication, that the altered McMurdo waypoint only involved a       change of 2.1 nautical miles. I am obliged to say that I do not       accept that explanation. There were certainly grave deficiencies in       communication within the Navigation Section, but the high       professional skills of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#3)"],[1,"they fence with wire about six feet in height. This kind of  farming is very popular with the better class of Boers, as it entails very  little labour, and no outlay beyond the initial expense. They raise just  enough meal to keep themselves, but do not farm for the market. They breed  horses and cattle; the horses are a poor-looking lot, as the Boers do not  believe much in blood. They never ride or work mares, but use them as brood  stock. This is a bad plan, as young and immature mares breed early on the  veldt, and throw weedy stock. Their cattle, however, are attended to on  much better lines, and most of the beef that I have seen would do credit to  any station in Australia, or any American ranch. They mostly raise a few  sheep and goats; the sheep are a poor lot, the wool is of a very inferior  class, and the mutton poor. I don't know much about goats, so will pass  them, though I very much doubt if any Australian squatter would give them  grass room.    On most of the farms a small orchard is found enclosed in stone walls. Here  again the ignorance of the Boers is very marked; the fruit is of poor  quality, though the variety is large. Thus, one finds in these orchards  pears, apples, grapes, plums, pomegranates, peaches, quinces, apricots, and  almonds. The fruit is harsh, small, and flavourless, owing to bad pruning,  want of proper manure, and good husbandry generally. The Boer seems to  think that he has done all that is required of him when he has planted a  tree; all that follows he leaves to nature, and he would much rather sit  down and pray for a beautiful harvest than get up and work for it. He is a  great believer in the power of prayer. He prays for a good crop of fruit;  if it comes he exalts himself and takes all the credit; if the crop fails  he folds his hands and remarks that it was God's will that things should so  come to pass. He knocks all the work he can out of his niggers, but does  precious little himself. In stature he is mostly tall, thin, and active. He  moves with a quick, shuffling gait, which is almost noiseless. Some of his  women folk are beautiful, while others are fat and clumsy, and are never  likely to have their portraits hung on the walls of the Royal Academy.                                        A PRISONER OF WAR.                                                         BLOEMFONTEIN HOSPITAL.      I little fancied when I sat at my ease in my tent in the British camp that  my next epistle would be written from a hospital as a prisoner, but such is  the case, and, after all, I am far more inclined to be thankful than to  growl at my luck. Let me tell the story, for it is typical of this peculiar  country, and still more peculiar war. I had been writing far into the  night, and had left the letter ready for post next day. Then, with a clear  conscience, I threw myself on my blankets, satisfied that I was ready for  what might happen next. Things were going to happen, but though the night  was big with fate there was no warning to me in the whispering wind. Some  men would have heard all sorts of sounds on such a night, but I am not  built that way I suppose. Anyway, I heard nothing until, half an hour  before dawn, a voice jarred my ear with the news that \"there was something  on, and I'd better fly round pretty sharp if I did not mean to miss it.\"    By the light of my lantern I saddled my horse, and snatched a hasty cup of  coffee and a mouthful of biscuit, and as the little band of Tasmanians  moved from Rensburg I rode with them. Where they were going, or what their  mission, I did not know, but I guessed it was to be no picnic. The quiet,  resolute manner of the officers, the hushed voices, the set, stern faces of  the young soldiers, none of whom had ever been under fire before, all told  me that there was blood in the air, so I asked no questions, and sat tight  in my saddle. As the daylight broke over the far-stretching veldt, I saw  that two other correspondents were with the party, viz., Reay, of the  Melbourne _Herald_, and Lambie, poor, ill-fated Lambie, of the  _Melbourne Age_. For a couple of hours we trotted along without  incident of any kind, then we halted at a farmhouse, the name of which I  have forgotten. There we found Captain Cameron encamped with the rest of  the Tasmanians, and after a short respite the troops moved outward again,  Captain Cameron in command; we had about eighty men, all of whom were  mounted.    As we rode off I heard the order given for every man to \"sit tight and keep  his eyes open.\" Then our scouts put spurs to their horses and dashed away  on either wing, skirting the kopjes and screening the main body, and so for  another hour we moved without seeing or hearing anything to cause us  trouble. By this time we had got into a kind of huge basin, the kopjes were  all round us, but the veldt was some miles in extent. I knew at a glance  that if the Boers were in force our little band was in for a bad time, as  an enemy hidden in those hills could watch our every movement on the plain,  note just where we intended to try and pass through the chain of hills, and  attack us with unerring certainty and suddenness. All at once one of our  scouts, who had been riding far out on our left flank, came flying in with  the news that the enemy was in the kopjes in front of us, and he further  added that he thought they intended to surround our party if possible.  Captain Cameron ordered the men to split into two parties, one to move  towards the kopjes on our right; the other to fall back and protect our  retreat, if such a move became necessary. Mr. Lambie and I decided to move  on with the advance party, and at a hard gallop we moved away towards a  line of kopjes that seemed higher than any of the others in the belt. As we  neared those hills it seemed to us that there were no Boers in possession,  and that nothing would come of the ride after all, and we drew bridle and  started to discuss the situation. At that time we were not far from the  edge of some kopjes, which, though lying low, were covered with rocky  boulders and low scrub.    We had drifted a few hundred yards behind the advance party, but were a  good distance in front of the rearguard, when a number of horsemen made a  dash from the kopjes which we were skirting, and the rifles began to speak.  There was no time for poetry; it was a case of \"sit tight and ride hard,\"  or surrender and be made prisoners. Lambie shouted to me: \"Let's make a  dash, Hales,\" and we made it. The Boers were very close to us before we  knew anything concerning their presence. Some of them were behind us, and  some extended along the edge of the kopjes by which we had to pass to get  to the British line in front, all of them were galloping in on us, shooting  as they rode, and shouting to us to surrender, and, had we been wise men,  we would have thrown up our hands, for it was almost hopeless to try and  ride through the rain of lead that whistled around us. It was no wonder we  were hit; the wonder to me is that we were not filled with lead, for some  of the bullets came so close to me that I think I should know them again if  I met them in a shop-window. We were racing by this time, Lambie's big  chestnut mare had gained a length on my little veldt pony, and we were not  more than a hundred yards away from the Mauser rifles that had closed in on  us from the kopjes. A voice called in good English: \"Throw up your hands,  you d---- fools.\" But the galloping fever was on us both, and we only  crouched lower on our horses' backs, and rode all the harder, for even a  barn-yard fowl loves liberty.    All at once I saw my comrade throw his hands up with a spasmodic gesture.  He rose in his stirrups, and fairly bounded high out of his saddle, and as  he spun round in the air I saw the red blood on the white face, and I knew  that death had come to him sudden and sharp. Again the rifles spoke, and  the lead was closer to me than ever a friend sticks in time of trouble, and  I knew in my heart that the next few strides would settle things. The black  pony was galloping gamely under my weight. Would he carry me safely out of  that line of fire, or would he fail me? Suddenly something touched me on  the right temple; it was not like a blow; it was not a shock; for half a  second I was conscious. I knew I was hit; knew that the reins had fallen  from my nerveless hands, knew that I was lying down upon my horse's back,  with my head hanging below his throat. Then all the world went out in one  mad whirl. Earth and heaven seemed to meet as if by magic. My horse seemed  to rise with me, not to fall, and then--chaos.    When next I knew I was still on this planet I found myself in the saddle  again, riding between two Boers, who were supporting me in the saddle as I  swayed from side to side. There was a halt; a man with a kindly face took  my head in the hollow of his arm, whilst another poured water down my  throat. Then they carried me to a shady spot beneath some shrubbery, and  laid me gently down. One man bent over me and washed the blood that had  dried on my face, and then carefully bound up my wounded temple. I began to  see things more plainly--a blue sky above me; a group of rough, hardy men,  all armed with rifles, around me. I saw that I was a prisoner, and when I  tried to move I soon knew I was damaged.    The same good-looking young fellow with the curly beard bent over me again.  \"Feel any better now, old fellow?\" I stared hard at the speaker, for he  spoke like an Englishman, and a well-educated one, too. \"Yes, I'm better.  I'm a prisoner, ain't I?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you an Englishman?\" I asked. He  laughed. \"Not I,\" he said, \"I'm a Boer born and bred, and I am the man who  bowled you over. What on earth made you do such a fool's trick as to try  and ride from our rifles at that distance?\" \"Didn't think I was welcome in  these parts.\" \"Don't make a jest of it, man,\" the Boer said gravely;"]]]
