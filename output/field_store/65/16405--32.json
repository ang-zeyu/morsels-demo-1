To all who have co-operated with them I wish to express my imperial       thanks for their loyal devotion to duty in making possible in       obedience to my call the transportation of armed masses of German       troops against my enemies. The present achievement [near Metz]       convinces me that the railways of the country will be equal to the       heaviest demands that might be made upon them during the course of       the gigantic struggle in which we are engaged for the future of the       German Nation.             *       *       *       *       *          THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN.    Kaiser's Telegram from Dresden to the King of Saxony, Oct. 2.           I am very glad to be able to send you the best reports of the       Nineteenth Army Corps and the Twelfth Reserve Corps. I visited       yesterday the Third Army and greeted especially the brave 181st       Regiment, to which I expressed my recognition. I found your third       son and your brother Max as well as Laffert and Kirchbach in the       best of health. The spirit among the men is splendid. With such an       army we shall be able to complete victoriously the rest of our       difficult task. To this end may the Almighty stand by us.         WILHELM.             *       *       *       *       *          HIS INDISCRETION WAS \"CALCULATED.\"    Interview With Kaiser Wilhelm II., Oct. 28, 1908, and Its  Consequences.      _An interview between the German Emperor and \"a representative  Englishman, who long since passed from public to private life,\"  appeared in The London Telegraph on Oct. 28, 1908, and was the next day  authenticated by the German Foreign Office in Berlin with the comment  that it was \"intended as a message to the English people.\" This last  expression of the Kaiser toward Great Britain--until his declarations on  the eve of the present war--deeply stirred the German people in protest  and resulted in the Kaiser's pledge to Chancellor von Buelow that  henceforth the imperial views would be subject to the bridle of the  Ministry and the Council of the Empire. The interview as recorded by the  \"representative Englishman\" was as follows:_         Moments sometimes occur in the history of nations when a calculated       indiscretion proves of the highest public service. It is for this       reason that I have decided to make known the substance of a lengthy       conversation which it was my recent privilege to have with the       Emperor.         I do so in the hope that it will help to remove that obstinate       misconception of the character of the Emperor's feelings toward       England, which I fear is deeply rooted in the ordinary Englishman's       breast. It is the Emperor's sincere wish that it should be       eradicated. He has given repeated proofs of his desire by word and       deed. But, to speak frankly, his patience is sorely tried now; he       finds himself so continually misrepresented and has so often       experienced the mortification of finding that any momentary       improvement in relations is followed by renewed outbursts of       prejudice and a prompt return to the old attitude of suspicion.         His Majesty spoke with impulsive and unusual frankness, saying:       \"You English are as mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come       over you that you are completely given over to suspicions that are       quite unworthy of a great nation? What more can I do than I have       done? I declared with all the emphasis at my command in my speech       at the Guildhall that my heart was set upon peace and that it was       one of my dearest wishes to live on the best terms with England.       Have I ever been false to my word? Falsehood and prevarication are       alien to my nature. My actions ought to speak for themselves, but       you will not listen to them, but to those who misinterpret and       distort them.\"    Resents a Personal Insult.         \"This is a personal insult which I resent; to be forever misjudged,       to have my repeated offers of friendship weighed and scrutinized       with jealous, mistrustful eyes taxes my patience severely. I have       said time after time that I am a friend of England, and your press,       or at least a considerable section of it, bids the people of       England to refuse my proffered hand and insinuates that the other       hand holds a dagger. How can I convince a nation against its will?\"         Complaining again of the difficulty imposed on him by English       distrust, his Majesty said: \"The prevailing sentiment of large       sections of the middle and lower classes of my own people is not       friendly to England. I am, therefore, so to speak, in the minority       in my own land, but it is a minority of the best element, just as       it is in England respecting Germany.\"         The Englishman reminded the Kaiser that not only England but the       whole of Europe viewed with disapproval the recent sending of the       German Consul at Algiers to Fez and forestalling France and Spain       by suggesting the recognition of Sultan Mulai Hafid. The Kaiser       made an impatient gesture and exclaimed: \"Yes? that is an excellent       example of the way German actions are misrepresented,\" and with       vivid directness he defended the aforesaid incident, as the German       Government has already done.         The interviewer reminded the Kaiser that an important and       influential section of the German newspapers interpreted these acts       very differently, and effusively approved of them because they       indicated that Germany was bent upon shaping events in Morocco.         \"There are mischief makers,\" replied the Emperor, \"in both       countries. I will not attempt to weigh their relative capacity for       misrepresentation, but the facts are as I have stated. There has       been nothing in Germany's recent action in regard to Morocco       contrary to the explicit declaration of my love of peace made both       at the Guildhall and in my latest speech at Strassburg.\"    Kaiser and the Boer War.    Reverting to his efforts to show his friendship for England, the Kaiser  said they had not been confined to words. It was commonly believed that  Germany was hostile to England throughout the Boer war. Undoubtedly the  newspapers were hostile and public opinion was hostile. \"But what,\" he  asked, \"of official Germany? What brought to a sudden stop, indeed, to  an absolute collapse, the European tour of the Boer delegates, who were  striving to obtain European intervention?\"         \"They were feted in Holland. France gave them a rapturous welcome.       They wished to come to Berlin, where the German people would have       crowned them with flowers, but when they asked me to receive them I       refused. The agitation immediately died away and the delegates       returned empty handed. Was that the action of a secret enemy?         \"Again, when the struggle was at its height, the German Government       was invited by France and Russia to join them in calling upon       England to end the war. The moment had come, they said, not only to       save the Boer republics, but also to humiliate England to the dust.       What was my reply? I said so far from Germany joining in any       concerted European action to bring pressure against England and       bring about her downfall Germany would always keep aloof from       politics that could bring her into complications with a sea power       like England.         \"Posterity will one day read the exact terms of a telegram, now in       the archives of Windsor Castle, in which I informed the sovereign       of England of the answer I returned to the powers which then sought       to compass her fall. Englishmen who now insult me by doubting my       word should know what my actions were in the hour of their       adversity.         \"Nor was that all. During your black week in December, 1899, when       disasters followed one another in rapid succession, I received a       letter from Queen Victoria, my revered grandmother, written in       sorrow and affliction and bearing manifest traces of the anxieties       which were preying upon her mind and health. I at once returned a       sympathetic reply. I did more. I bade one of my officers to procure       as exact an account as he could obtain of the number of combatants       on both sides and the actual positions of the opposing forces.         \"With the figures before me I worked out what I considered the best       plan of campaign in the circumstances and submitted it to my       General Staff for criticism. Then I dispatched it to England. That       document likewise is among the State papers at Windsor awaiting the       serenely impartial verdict of history.         \"Let me add as a curious coincidence that the plan which I       formulated ran very much on the same lines as that actually adopted       by Gen. Roberts and carried by him into successful operation. Was       that the act of one who wished England ill? Let Englishmen be just       and say.\"    The German Navy.      Touching then upon the English conviction that Germany is increasing her  navy for the purpose of attacking Great Britain, the Kaiser reiterated  the explanation that Chancellor von Buelow and other Ministers have made  familiar, dwelling upon Germany's worldwide commerce, her manifold  interests in distant seas, and the necessity for being prepared to  protect them. He said:         \"Patriotic Germans refuse to assign any bounds to their legitimate       commercial ambitions. They expect their interests to go on growing.       They must be able to champion them manfully in any quarter of the       globe. Germany looks ahead. Her horizons stretch far away. She must       be prepared for any eventualities"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16342"],[0,"A Treatise on Simple Counterpoint in Forty Lessons (#3)"],[1,"g. 49 is not good.    [Illustration: Fig. 49.]    The embellishment may be used either above or below, whether a semitone or  a whole tone; but when it is a whole tone below, it is most satisfactory as  the ninth of the implied chord. [Fig. 50.]    [Illustration: Fig. 50.]    In minor the sixth and seventh degrees of the scale are raised both  ascending and descending, when used in harmonies containing the  leading-tone as a chord-tone. They are unaltered both ascending and  descending in harmonies containing the sixth degree of the scale as a  chord-tone. In other harmonies they are raised in ascending only.    The sixth or seventh degrees may be chromatically altered with only one  note intervening. [Fig. 51.]    [Illustration: Fig. 51.]    Six notes may be written to one of the cantus firmus, as in Fig. 52.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.]    The cadences in Fig. 53 are good.    [Illustration: Fig. 53.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write three counterpoints above and three below, in  the third species.    Write two eight-measure phrases, using second species continuously in both  parts. [Fig. 34.]      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 54.]          LESSON V    THIRD SPECIES IN BOTH PARTS      [Illustration: Fig. 55.]    The suggestions given for writing second species in both parts apply here,  except that when both parts move degreewise, any interval may come on the  second and fourth quarters, preferably a consonance. The third quarter is  treated the same as the second half when writing the second species in both  parts.    The augmented fourth, and diminished fifth and seventh, may be approached  in similar motion. [Fig. 56.]    [Illustration: Fig. 56.]    The augmented fourth following the perfect fourth, as in Fig. 56_a_, is good.    The minor seventh, and the major and minor ninth of a chord, may be used  freely on any but the first quarter, but must be consonant with the other  part. [Fig. 57.]    [Illustration: Fig. 57.]    The first and third species may be mixed, as in Fig. 58.    [Illustration: Fig. 58.]    The second species may be used in one part and the third in the other, also  six notes in one part and two in the other, and six in one and three in the  other. All tones appearing simultaneously, must comply with the suggestions  for tones appearing on the weak beat given in previous lessons, where both  parts have other than the first species. [Fig. 59.]    [Illustration: Fig. 59.]    The cadences in Fig. 60 are good, and will suggest others.    [Illustration: Fig. 60.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write one counterpoint above and one below, in the  third species.    To cantus firmus _b_ write counterpoints in six notes, one above and one  below. [Fig. 52.]    Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing the first and third species. [Fig.  58.]    Write two eight-measure phrases, using third species in both parts. [Fig.  55.]      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 61.]          LESSON VI    FOURTH SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 62.]    This species is the same as the second, except that the last note of the  measure is tied to the first note of the next, forming a syncopation. As in  the second species, the first note of the counterpoint should form a  unison, octave or fifth, and when the counterpoint begins on the second  half it may also be an imperfect consonance.    When the counterpoint begins on the first half, the second half is treated  the same as the second half of succeeding measures, described in the next  paragraph.    After the first measure, the second half of the measure should contain a  consonance (Fig. 63_a_), the first half a consonance (_b_), or dissonance  (_c_), preferably the latter, in which case a suspension is formed. This is  the most desirable form of syncopation. When the first half contains a  dissonance, the counterpoint must descend--or ascend in retardation  (_d_)--one degree to an imperfect consonance (_c_). When the first half is  a consonance, it may be left by a skip to some other chord-tone (_e_), or  by degreewise progression (_f_). In the latter case the second note is  non-harmonic, and therefore should not be used to prepare a syncopation  except as in Fig. 63_d_ (Retardation of the root in I_6).    [Illustration: Fig. 63.]    When writing three notes to one in the fourth species, the suspension may  resolve on the second beat (_a_), or the third (_b_). In the latter case,  the suspension skips (_c_) to some other chord-tone, before resolving. The  resolution to the leading-tone (_d_) forms an important exception to this  rule. [Fig. 64.]    [Illustration: Fig. 64.]    The fifth may be used in the lower part if it becomes the preparation of a  suspension (Fig. 65_a_). It may also be used in the lower part, as in Fig.  65_b_, provided it resolves by skipping to the third of the chord.    In skipping from the fifth to the root, or the reverse, in the lower part,  do so in an upward direction. The fifth, when treated as an harmonic  passing-tone, may, however, be approached either ascending or descending.    [Illustration: Fig. 65.]    The retardation should be used only when prepared by the leading-tone. It  rises a semitone in resolving. [Fig. 66.]    [Illustration: Fig. 66.]    The following dissonant intervals may be used on the first half of the  measure:--When the counterpoint is above, the fourth and seventh in  suspension, and second and fifth in retardation; and when below, the second  in suspension, and the fourth and seventh in retardation. [Fig. 67.]    [Illustration: Fig. 67.]    Consecutive fifths on consecutive strong beats of the measure are good when  one of the tones of the second fifth is prepared, as in Fig. 68.    [Illustration: Fig. 68.]    The following cadences are good:    [Illustration: Fig. 69.]      EXERCISES    Write one eight-measure phrase with two notes to the measure in one part  and six in the other; one with three notes in one and six in the other; and  one with two notes in one part and four in the other. (Fig. 59.) In  combining the species in this and succeeding lessons the student may place  any species in any part.    To the cantus firmus write two counterpoints above and two below, in the  fourth species.      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 70.]          LESSON VII    FOURTH SPECIES (Continued)      The first and fourth species may be mixed as in Fig. 71. Rules for writing  other than the first species in both parts are to be regarded.    [Illustration: Fig. 71.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below, in the  fourth species.    To cantus firmus _b_ write two above and two below, three half-notes to the  measure, with syncopations.    Write two eight-measure phrases, mixing the first and fourth species.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 72.]          LESSON VIII    COMBINING THE FOURTH SPECIES WITH THE OTHERS      All previous rules for combining species still apply.    In combining the fourth species with other than the first, the following  intervals may be used on the first half of the measure, in addition to  those mentioned in Lesson VI: When the counterpoint is below, the fourth,  fifth and seventh in suspension, and the ninth in retardation; and when  above, the fifth in suspension, and the seventh in retardation; but in  every such case the part having other than the fourth species must skip to  some other chord-tone before resolving the suspension. [Fig. 73.]    [Illustration: Fig. 73.]    The leading-tone may be doubled as in Fig. 74. Here the leading-tone that  is prepared skips to some other chord-tone, while the new leading-tone  remains stationary.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.]    The minor or diminished seventh, major or minor ninth, may be used as  preparation of a suspension in either part, provided it is approached by a  skip in an upward direction, and is consonant with the other part, or is  one of the permitted dissonances. [Fig. 75.]    [Illustration: Fig. 75.]    The fourth species may be combined with the second or third species, and  two or three notes syncopated may be written in one part with six in the  other. [Fig. 76.]    [Illustration: Fig. 76.]      EXERCISES    To the cantus firmus write one counterpoint above and one below, in the  fourth species.    Write one eight-measure phrase each, of the following combinations: The  fourth species with the second; the fourth with the third; two notes  syncopated against six notes; and three notes syncopated against six notes.  Write some in major and some in minor. [Fig. 76.]      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 77.]          LESSON IX    FIFTH SPECIES: FLORID COUNTERPOINT      [Illustration: Fig. 78.]    Florid counterpoint is a mixture of the second, third and fourth species.    In addition to these species eighth-notes may be used in groups of two on  the second and fourth quarters of the measure. Both notes should be  approached and left stepwise, with the exception that the first may be  taken by a skip. [Fig. 79.]    [Illustration: Fig. 79.]    Not more than one and one-half measures of any one species should be used  continuously in one part. [Fig. 80.]    [Illustration: Fig. 80.]    In the use of quarter-notes it is necessary to exercise care. They may be  used on the first half when preceded by quarter-notes, when the entire  measure is filled, or when they precede a half-note which is the  preparation of a suspension. On the second half they are always good. [Fig.  81.]    [Illustration: Fig. 81.]    For the present the suspension should not be less than a half-note or its  rhythmic equivalent in the ornamental resolution.    In this species the suspension may resolve ornamentally, that is, it may  have some note or notes interpolated between the suspension and its  resolution. The relative position of the suspension and its resolution must  remain the same as in the regular resolution. [Fig. 82.]    When the suspension is left by a leap, the note"]]]
