When I say 'Stick 'em up' I mean it. Never take a  chance. Ah--ah!\"    The fellow ripped open Tom's overcoat, almost tearing the buttons off.  Another masterful jerk and his victim's jacket was likewise parted  widely. He did not lower the club for an instant.  He thrust his left  hand into the V-shaped parting of the young fellow's vest.    It was then that Tom was convinced of what the fellow was after. He  remembered the notes he had made regarding the contract that was to be  signed on the morrow between the Swift Construction Company and  President Richard Bartholomew of the H. & P. A. Railroad. He  remembered, too, the figure he thought he had seen in the dark porch of  the house as he so recently left it.    Mr. Bartholomew had considered it very possible that he was being spied  upon. This was one of the spies--a Westerner, as his speech betrayed.  But Tom was suddenly less fearful than he had been when first attacked.    It did not seem possible to him that Mr. Bartholomew's enemies would  allow their henchman to go too far to obtain information of the  railroad president's intentions. This fellow was merely attempting to  frighten him.    A sense of relief came to Tom Swift's assistance. He opened his lips to  speak and could the thug have seen his face more clearly in the dark he  would have been aware of the fact that the young inventor smiled.    The fellow's groping hand entered between Tom's vest and his shirt. The  coarse fingers seized upon Tom's wallet. Nobody likes to be robbed, no  matter whether the loss is great or small. There was not much money in  the wallet, nor anything that could be turned into money by a thief.    These facts enabled Tom, perhaps, to bear his loss with some fortitude.  The highwayman drew forth the wallet and thrust it into his own coat  pocket. He made no attempt to take anything else from the young  inventor.    \"Now, beat it!\" commanded the fellow. \"Don't look back and don't run or  holler. Just keep moving--in the way you were headed before. Vamoose.\"    More than ever was Tom assured that the man was from the West.  His  speech savored of Mexican phrases and slang terms used mainly by  Western citizens. And his abrupt and masterly manner and speech aided  in this supposition. Tom Swift stayed not to utter a word. It was true  he was not so frightened as he had at first been. But he was quite sure  that this man was no person to contend with under present conditions.    He strode away along the sidewalk toward the far corner of the wall  that surrounded this estate. Shopton had not many of such important  dwellings as this behind the wall. Its residential section was made up  for the most part of mechanics' homes and such plain but substantial  houses as his father's.    Prospering as the Swifts had during the last few years, neither Tom nor  his father had thought their plain old house too poor or humble for a  continued residence. Tom was glad to make money, but the inventions he  had made it by were vastly more important to his mind than what he  might obtain by any lavish expenditure of his growing fortune.    This matter of the electric locomotive that had been brought to his  attention by the Western railroad magnate had instantly interested the  young inventor. The possibility of there being a clash of interests in  the matter, and the point Mr. Bartholomew made of his enemies seeking  to thwart his hope of keeping the H.  & P. A. upon a solid financial  footing, were phases of the affair that likewise concerned the young  fellow's thought.    Now he was sure that Mr. Bartholomew was right. The enemies of the H. &  P. A. were determined to know all that the railroad president was  planning to do. They would naturally suspect that his trip East to  visit the Swift Construction Company was no idle jaunt.    Tom had turned so many fortunate and important problems of invention  into certainties that the name of the Swift Construction Company was  broadly known, not alone throughout the United States but in several  foreign countries. Montagne Lewis, whom Tom knew to be both a powerful  and an unscrupulous financier, might be sure that Mr. Bartholomew's  visit to Shopton and to the young inventor and his father was of such  importance that he would do well through his henchmen to learn the  particulars of the interview.    Tom remembered Mr. Bartholomew's mention of a name like Andy O'Malley.  This was probably the man who had done all that he could, and that  promptly, to set about the discovery of Mr. Bartholomew's reason for  visiting the Swifts.    Without doubt the man had slunk about the Swift house and had peered  into one of the library windows while the interview was proceeding. He  had observed Tom making notes on the scratch pad and judged correctly  that those notes dealt with the subject under discussion between the  visitor from the West and the Swifts.    He had likewise seen Tom thrust the paper into his wallet and the  wallet into his inside vest pocket. Instead of dogging Mr.  Bartholomew's footsteps after that gentleman left the Swift house, the  man had waited for the appearance of Tom. When he was sure that the  young fellow was preparing to walk out, and the direction he was to  stroll, the thug had run ahead and ensconced himself in the archway on  this dark block.    All these things were plain enough. The notes Tom had taken regarding  the offer Mr. Bartholomew had made for the development of the electric  locomotive might, under some circumstances, be very important. At  least, the highwayman evidently thought them such. But Tom had another  thought about that.    One thing the young inventor was convinced about, as he strode briskly  away from the scene of the hold-up: There was going to be trouble. It  had already begun.          Chapter III    Tom Swift's Friends      Tom was still walking swiftly when he arrived in sight of Mary Nestor's  home. He was so filled with excitement both because of the hold-up and  the new scheme that Mr. Richard Bartholomew had brought to him from the  West, that he could keep neither to himself. He just had to tell Mary!    Mary Nestor was a very pretty girl, and Tom thought she was just about  right in every particular. Although he had been about a good deal for a  young fellow and had seen girls everywhere, none of them came up to  Mary. None of them held Tom's interest for a minute but this girl whom  he had been around with for years and whom he had always confided in.    As for the girl herself, she considered Tom Swift the very nicest young  man she had ever seen. He was her beau-ideal of what a young man should  be. And she entered enthusiastically into the plans for everything that  Tom Swift was interested in.    Mary was excited by the story Tom told her in the Nestor sitting room.  The idea of the electric locomotive she saw, of course, was something  that might add to Tom's laurels as an inventor. But the other phase of  the evening's adventure--\"Tom, dear!\" she murmured with no little  disturbance of mind. \"That man who stopped you! He is a thief, and a  dangerous man! I hate to think of your going home alone.\"    \"He's got what he was after,\" chuckled Tom. \"Is it likely he will  bother me again?\"    \"And you do not seem much worried about it,\" she cried, in wonder.    \"Not much, I confess, Mary,\" said Tom, and grinned.    \"But if, as you suppose, that man was working for Mr. Bartholomew's  enemies--\"    \"I am convinced that he was, for he did not rob me of my watch and  chain or loose money. And he could have done so easily. I don't mind  about the old wallet. There was only five dollars in it.\"    \"But those notes you said you took of Mr. Bartholomew's offer?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" chuckled Tom again. \"Those notes. Well, I may as well  explain to you, Mary, and not try to puzzle you any longer.  But that  highwayman is sure going to be puzzled a long, long time.\"    \"What do you mean, Tom?\"    \"Those notes were jotted down in my own brand of shorthand.  Such  stenographic notes would scarcely be readable by anybody else. Ho, ho!  When that bold, bad hold-up gent turns the notes over to Montagne  Lewis, or whoever his principal is, there will be a sweet time.\"    \"Oh, Tom! isn't that fun?\" cried Mary, likewise much amused.    \"I can remember everything we said there in the library,\" Tom  continued. \"I'll see Ned tonight on my way home from here, and he will  draw a contract the first thing in the morning.\"    \"You are a smart fellow, Tom!\" said Mary, her laughter trilling sweetly.    \"Many thanks, Ma'am! Hope I prove your compliment true. This  two-mile-a-minute stunt--\"    \"It seems wonderful,\" breathed Mary.    \"It sure will be wonderful if we can build a locomotive that will do  such fancy lacework as that,\" observed Tom eagerly. \"It will be a great  stunt!\"    \"A wonderful invention, Tom.\"    \"More wonderful than Mr. Bartholomew knows,\" agreed the young fellow.  \"An electric locomotive with both great speed and great hauling power  is what more than one inventor has been aiming at for two or three  decades. Ever since Edison and Westinghouse began their experiments, in  truth.\"    \"Is the locomotive they are using out there a very marvelous machine?\"  asked the girl, with added interest.    \"No more marvelous than the big electric motors that drag the trains  into New York City, for instance, through the tunnels.  Steam engines  cannot be used in those tunnels for obvious, as well as legal, reasons.  They are all wonderful machines, using third-rail power.    \"But that Jandel patent that Mr. Bartholomew is using out there on the  H. & P. A. is probably the highest type of such motors. It is up to us  to beat that. Fortunately I got a pass into the Jandel shops a few  months ago and I studied at first hand the machine Mr. Bartholomew is  using.\"    \"Isn't that great!\" cried Mary.

Wool when ignited  does not burn with a bright flame, as vegetable fiber does, but  consumes with a feeble smouldering glow, soon extinguishes, spreading  a disagreeable pungent vapor, as of burning horn. By placing a test  tube with a solution of five parts caustic potash in 100 parts water,  a mixture of vegetable fibers and wool fibers, the latter dissolve if  the fluid is brought to boiling above an alcohol flame, while the  cotton and linen fibers remain intact.    The solubility of the woolen fibers in potash lye is a ready means of  ascertaining the percentage of wool fiber in the paper. An exhaustive  analysis of the latter can be performed in the following manner: A  known quantity of the paper is slowly dried in a drying apparatus at  temperature of 230 deg. Fahrenheit, until a sample weighed on a scale  remains constant. The loss of weight indicates the degree of humidity.  To determine the ash percentage, the sample is placed in a platinum  crucible, and held over a lamp until all the organic matter is burned  out and the ash has assumed a light color. The cold ash is then  moistened with a carbonate of ammonia solution, and the crucible again  exposed until it is dark red; the weight of the ash is then taken. To  determine the percentage of wool, a sample of the paper is dried at  230 deg. Fahrenheit and weighed, boiled in a porcelain dish in potash lye  12 deg. B. strong, and frequently stirred with a glass rod. The wool fiber  soon dissolves in the potash lye, while the vegetable fiber remains  unaltered. The pulpy mass resulting is placed upon a filter, dried at  212 deg. Fahrenheit, and after the potash lye has dripped off, the  residue, consisting of vegetable fiber and earthy ash ingredients, is  washed until the water ceases to dissolve anything. The residue dried  at 212 deg. Fahrenheit is weighed with a filter, after which that of the  latter is deducted. The loss of weight experienced is essentially  equal to the loss of the wool fiber. If the filtrate is saturated with  hydrochloric acid, the dissolved wool fiber separates again, and after  having been collected upon a weighed filter, it may be weighed and the  quantity ascertained.    The weight of the mineral substances in the raw paper is ascertained  by analyzing the ash in a manner similar to that above described. The  several constituents of the ash and the mineral added to the raw paper  are ascertained as follows: Sufficient of the paper is calcined in the  manner described; a known quantity of the ash is weighed and thrown  into a small porcelain dish containing a little distilled water and an  excess of chemically pure hydrochloric acid. In this solution are  dissolved the carbonates, carbonate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, a  little of sulphate of alumina, as well as metallic oxides, while  silicate of magnesia, silicic acid, sulphate of lime (gypsum) remain  undissolved. The substance is heated until the water and excess of  free hydrochloric acid have been driven off; it is then moistened with  a little hydrochloric acid, diluted with distilled water and heated.  The undissolved residue is by filtering separated from the dissolved,  the filter washed with distilled water, and the wash water added to  the filtrate. The undissolved residue is dried, and after the filter  has also been burned in due manner and the ash added, the weight is  ascertained. It consists of clay, sand, silicic acid and gypsum.    The filtrate is then poured into a cylinder capable of holding 100  cubic centimeters, and furnished with a scale; sufficient distilled  water is then added until the well-shaken fluid measures precisely 100  cubic centimeters. By means of this measuring instrument, the filtrate  is then divided into two equal portions. One of these parts is in a  beaker glass over-saturated with chemically pure chloride of ammonia,  whereby any iron of oxide present and a little dissolved alumina fall  down as deposit. The precipitate is separated by filtering, washed,  dried at 212 deg. Fahrenheit and weighed. To the filtrate is then added a  solution of oxalate of ammonia until a white precipitate of oxalate of  lime is formed. This precipitate is separated by filtering, washed,  dried and when separated from the filter, is collected upon dark  satinized paper; the filter itself is burned and the ash added to the  oxalate of lime. This oxalate of lime is then heated to a dark red  heat in a platinum crucible with lid until the oxalate of lime is  converted into carbonate of lime. By the addition of a few drops of  carbonate of ammonia solution and another slight heating of the  crucible, also the caustic lime produced in the filter ash by heating,  is reconverted into carbonate of lime, and after cooling in the  exsiccator, the whole contents of the crucible is weighed as  carbonate of lime, after deducting the known quantity of filter ash.    Any magnesia present in the filtrate of the oxalate of lime is by the  addition of a solution of phosphate of soda separated as phosphate of  ammonia and magnesia, after having stood twenty-four hours. The  precipitate is filtered off, washed with water to which a little  chloride of ammonia is added, dried, and after calcining the fiber and  adding the filter ash, glow heated in the crucible. The glowed  substance is weighed after cooling, and is pyrophosphate of magnesia,  from which the magnesia or carbonate of magnesia is calculated  stoichiometrically. All the ascertained sums must be multiplied by 2,  if they are to correspond to the analyzed and weighed quantity of ash.    The second half of the filtrate is used for determining the small  quantity of sulphate of lime still contained in the hydrochlorate  solution. By adding chloride of barium solution the sulphuric acid is  bound to the barytes and sulphate of baryta separates as white  precipitate. This is separated by filtering, washed, dried and weighed  in the customary manner. From the weight of the sulphate of baryta is  then computed the weight of sulphate of lime, which has passed over  into solution. The ascertained sum is also to be multiplied with 2.    The manufacture of roll tar paper from the roll paper was at first  found to be difficult, as it was impossible to submerge a surface  larger than from ten to fifteen square yards, rolled up, in the tar,  because more would have required too large a pan. Besides this, the  paper tears easily, when it is in the hot tar. All kinds of  experiments were tried, in order to impregnate the surface of the  paper without employing too large a pan.    The following method was tried at first: The roll paper was cut into  lengths of ten yards, which were rolled up loosely, so that a certain  space was left between the different coils. These loose rolls, of  course, occupied much space and could be put into the tar only in a  standing position, because in a horizontal one the several coils would  have pressed together again. The loose roll was therefore slipped over  a vertical iron rod fastened into a circular perforated wooden foot.  The upper end of this iron rod ended in a ring, in which the hook of a  chain or rope could be fastened. With the aid of a windlass the roll  was raised or lowered. When placed in the pan with boiling tar, it was  left there until thoroughly saturated. It was then taken out, placed  upon a table, and the excess of tar allowed to drip off into a vessel  underneath. After partially drying, the roll was spread out in open  air, occasionally turned, until sufficiently dried, when it was rolled  up again.    In order to neutralize the smeary, sticky condition of the surface and  avoid the disagreeable drying in open air, the experiment of strewing  sand on the sticky places was tried next. The weight of the paper was  largely increased by the sand, and appeared considerably thicker. For  this reason the method of sanding the paper was at once universally  adopted. To dispense with the process of permitting the surplus tar to  drip off, means were devised by which it was taken off by scrapers, or  by pressing through rollers. The scrapers, two sharp edged rods  fastened across the pan, were then so placed that the paper was drawn  through them. The excess of tar adhering to its surface was thereby  scraped off and ran back into the pan.    This work, however, was performed better and to more satisfaction by a  pair of rollers fastened to the pan. These performed a double duty;  thoroughly removed the tar from the surface and by reason of their  pressure they caused a more perfect incorporation of the tar with the  fibers of the paper. Finally, different factories employed different  methods of manufacture, one of which was to cut the rolls into  definite lengths of about ten yards; these were then rerolled very  loosely and immersed in the hot tar until sufficiently saturated. The  paper was then passed through the roller, much pressure exerted, and  then loosely rolled up again. Being tarred once, it was then laid into  a second pan with hot tar, reeled out after a time, strewn with sand,  and rolled up again. Another method was to cut clothes lines into  lengths of about fifteen yards, and at a distance of two inches have  knots tied in them. The paper was cut in lengths of ten or fifteen  yards, three pieces of the knotted clothes line were then rolled  between the loose coils of paper, which was then submerged in the tar,  which on account of the knots could penetrate the paper. The paper was  next sanded by permitting its lower surface to pass over dry sand in a  box standing on the floor. A workman rolled off the paper, and with  his hand he strews sand on the upper surface. The rolling taking place  on the edge of a table, by means of a crank, the excess of sand  dropped off.    It is said by this method two workmen, one of which tends to the  rolling and sanding, the other turning the crank, could turn out"]]]
