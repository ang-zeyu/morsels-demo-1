He stared across the  circle at the Company man. Dane waited eagerly. What _was_ the I-S going  to say to that?    But the fellow did have an answer, ready and waiting. \"It is true,  fathers of clans, that here are two voices, where by right and custom  there should only be one. But this is a matter which can be decided  between us. Give us leave to withdraw from your sight and speak privately  together. Then he who returns to you will be the true voice and there  shall be no more division--\"    It was Paft who broke in before Halfer's spokesman could reply.    \"It would have been better to have spoken together before you came to us.  Go then until the shadow of the shield is not, then return hither and  speak truly. We do not wait upon the pleasure of outlanders--\"    A murmur approved that tart comment. \"Until the shadow of the shield is  not.\" They had until noon. Van Rycke arose and Dane gathered up his  chief's possessions. With the same superiority to his surroundings he had  shown upon entering, the Cargo-master left the enclosure, the Eysies  following. But they were away from the clearing, out upon the road back  to the Queen before the two from the Company caught up with them.    \"Captain Grange will see you right away--\" the Eysie Cargo-master was  beginning when Van Rycke met him with a quelling stare.    \"If you poachers have anything to say--you say it at the Queen and to  Captain Jellico,\" he stated flatly and started on.    Above his tight tunic collar the other's face flushed, his teeth flashed  as he caught his lower lip between them as if to forcibly restrain an  answer he longed to make. For a second he hesitated and then he vanished  down a side path with his assistant. Van Rycke had gone a quarter of the  distance back to the ship before he spoke.    \"I thought it was too easy,\" he muttered. \"Now we're in for it--maybe  right up the rockets! By the Spiked Tail of Exol, this is certainly _not_  our lucky day!\" He quickened pace until they were close to trotting.          Chapter II    RIVALS      \"That's far enough, Eysie!\"    Although Traders by law and tradition carried no more potent personal  weapons--except in times of great crisis--than hand sleep rods, the  resultant shot from the latter was just as unpleasant for temporary  periods as a more forceful beam--and the threat of it was enough to halt  the three men who had come to the foot of the Queen's ramp and who could  see the rod held rather negligently by Ali. Ali's eyes were anything but  negligent, however, and Free Traders had reputations to be respected by  their rivals of the Companies. The very nature of their roving lives  taught them savage lessons--which they either learned or died.    Dane, glancing down over the Engineer-apprentice's shoulder, saw that Van  Rycke's assumption of confidence had indeed paid off. They had left the  trade enclosure of the Salariki barely three-quarters of an hour ago. But  below now stood the bebadged Captain of the I-S ship and his  Cargo-master.    \"I want to speak to your Captain--\" snarled the Eysie officer.    Ali registered faint amusement, an expression which tended to rouse the  worst in the spectator, as Dane knew of old when that same mocking  appraisal had been turned on him as the rawest of the Queen's crew.    \"But does _he_ wish to speak to you?\" countered Kamil. \"Just stay where  you are, Eysie, until we are sure about that fact.\"    That was his cue to act as messenger. Dane retreated into the ship and  swung up the ladder to the command section. As he passed Captain  Jellico's private cabin he heard the muffled squall of the commander's  unpleasant pet--Queex, the Hoobat--a nightmare combination of crab,  parrot and toad, wearing a blue feather coating and inclined to scream  and spit at all comers. Since Queex would not be howling in that fashion  if its master was present, Dane kept on to the control cabin where he  blundered in upon an executive level conference of Captain, Cargo-master  and Astrogator.    \"Well?\" Jellico's blaster scarred left cheek twitched as he snapped that  impatient inquiry at the messenger.    \"Eysie Captain below, sir. With his Cargo-master. They want to see you--\"    Jellico's mouth was a straight line, his eyes very hard. By instinct  Dane's hand went to the grip of the sleep rod slung at his belt. When the  Old Man put on his fighting face--look out! Here we go again, he told  himself, speculating as to just what type of action lay before them now.    \"Oh, they do, do they!\" Jellico began and then throttled down the temper  he could put under iron control when and if it were necessary. \"Very  well, tell them to stay where they are. Van, we'll go down--\"    For a moment the Cargo-master hesitated, his heavy-lidded eyes looked  sleepy, he seemed almost disinterested in the suggestion. And when he  nodded it was with the air of someone about to perform some boring duty.    \"Right, sir.\" He wriggled his heavy body from behind the small table,  resealed his tunic, and settled his cap with as much precision as if he  were about to represent the Queen before the assembled nobility of  Sargol.    Dane hurried down the ladders, coming to a halt beside Ali. It was the  turn of the man at the foot of the ramp to bark an impatient demand:    \"Well?\" (Was that the theme word of every Captain's vocabulary?)    \"You wait,\" Dane replied with no inclination to give the Eysie officer  any courtesy address. Close to a Terran year aboard the Solar Queen had  inoculated him with pride in his own section of Service. A Free Trader  was answerable to his own officers and to no one else on earth--or among  the stars--no matter how much discipline and official etiquette the  Companies used to enhance their power.    He half expected the I-S officers to leave after an answer such as that.  For a Company Captain to be forced to wait upon the convenience of a Free  Trader must be galling in the extreme. And the fact that this one was  doing just that was an indication that the Queen's crew did, perhaps,  have the edge of advantage in any coming bargain. In the meantime the  Eysie contingent fumed below while Ali lounged whistling against the exit  port, playing with his sleep rod and Dane studied the grass forest. His  boot nudged a packet just inside the port casing and he glanced  inquiringly from it to Ali.    \"Cat ransom,\" the other answered his unspoken question.    So that was it--the fee for Sinbad's return. \"What is it today?\"    \"Sugar--about a tablespoon full,\" the Engineer-assistant returned, \"and  two colored steelos. So far they haven't run up the price on us. I think  they're sharing out the spoil evenly, a new cub brings him back every  night.\"    As did all Terran ships, the Solar Queen carried a cat as an important  member of the regular crew. And the portly Sinbad, before their landing  on Sargol, had never presented any problem. He had done his duty of  ridding the ship of unusual and usual pests and cargo despoilers with  dispatch, neatness and energy. And when in port on alien worlds had never  shown any inclination to go a-roving.    But the scents of Sargol had apparently intoxicated him, shearing away  his solid dignity and middle-aged dependability. Now Sinbad flashed out  of the Queen at the opening of her port in the early morning and was  brought back, protesting with both voice and claws, at the end of the day  by that member of the juvenile population whose turn it was to collect  the standing reward for his forceful delivery. Within three days it had  become an accepted business transaction which satisfied everyone but  Sinbad.    The scrape of metal boot soles on ladder rungs warned of the arrival of  their officers. Ali and Dane withdrew down the corridor, leaving the  entrance open for Jellico and Van Rycke. Then they drifted back to  witness the meeting with the Eysies.    There were no prolonged greetings between the two parties, no offer of  hospitality as might have been expected between Terrans on an alien  planet a quarter of the Galaxy away from the earth which had given them a  common heritage.    Jellico, with Van Rycke at his shoulder, halted before he stepped from  the ramp so that the three Inter-Solar men, Captain, Cargo-master and  escort, whether they wished or no, were put in the disadvantageous  position of having to look up to a Captain whom they, as members of one  of the powerful Companies, affected to despise. The lean, well muscled,  trim figure of the Queen's commander gave the impression of hard bitten  force held in check by will control, just as his face under its thick  layer of space burn was that of an adventurer accustomed to make split  second decisions--an estimate underlined by that seam of blaster burn  across one flat cheek.    Van Rycke, with a slight change of dress, could have been a Company man  in the higher ranks--or so the casual observer would have placed him,  until an observer marked the eyes behind those sleepy drooping lids, or  caught a certain note in the calm, unhurried drawl of his voice. To look  at the two senior officers of the Free Trading spacer were the antithesis  of each other--in action they were each half of a powerful, steamroller  whole--as a good many men in the Service--scattered over a half dozen or  so planets--had discovered to their cost in the past.    Now Jellico brought the heels of his space boots together with an  extravagant click and his hand flourished at the fore of his helmet in a  gesture which was better suited to the Patrol hero of a slightly  out-of-date Video serial.    \"Jellico, Solar Queen, Free Trader,\" he identified himself brusquely, and  added, \"this is Van Rycke, our Cargo-master.\"    Not all the flush had faded from the face of the I-S Captain.    \"Grange of the Dart,\" he did not even sketch a salute. \"Inter-Solar.  Kallee, Cargo-master-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#3)"],[1,"story I now commence is rich in vicissitudes, grim with              2  warfare, torn by civil strife, a tale of horror even during times of  peace. It tells of four emperors slain by the sword, three several  civil wars, an even larger number of foreign wars and some that were  both at once: successes in the East, disaster in the West, disturbance  in Illyricum, disaffection in the provinces of Gaul, the conquest of  Britain and its immediate loss, the rising of the Sarmatian and Suebic  tribes. It tells how Dacia had the privilege of exchanging blows with  Rome, and how a pretender claiming to be Nero almost deluded the  Parthians into declaring war. Now too Italy was smitten with new  disasters, or disasters it had not witnessed for a long period of  years. Towns along the rich coast of Campania were submerged or  buried. The city was devastated by fires, ancient temples were  destroyed, and the Capitol itself was fired by Roman hands. Sacred  rites were grossly profaned, and there were scandals in high  places.[7] The sea swarmed with exiles and the island cliffs[8] were  red with blood. Worse horrors reigned in the city. To be rich or  well-born was a crime: men were prosecuted for holding or for refusing  office: merit of any kind meant certain ruin. Nor were the Informers  more hated for their crimes than for their prizes: some carried off a  priesthood or the consulship as their spoil, others won offices and  influence in the imperial household: the hatred and fear they inspired  worked universal havoc. Slaves were bribed against their masters,  freedmen against their patrons, and, if a man had no enemies, he was  ruined by his friends.    However, the period was not so utterly barren as to yield no             3  examples of heroism. There were mothers who followed their sons, and  wives their husbands into exile: one saw here a kinsman's courage and  there a son-in-law's devotion: slaves obstinately faithful even on the  rack: distinguished men bravely facing the utmost straits and matching  in their end the famous deaths of older times. Besides these manifold  disasters to mankind there were portents in the sky and on the earth,  thunderbolts and other premonitions of good and of evil, some  doubtful, some obvious. Indeed never has it been proved by such  terrible disasters to Rome or by such clear evidence that Providence  is concerned not with our peace of mind but rather with vengeance for  our sin.    FOOTNOTES:         [5] To Vespasian Tacitus probably owed his quaestorship and a           seat in the senate; to Titus his tribunate of the people; to           Domitian the praetorship and a 'fellowship' of one of the           great priestly colleges, whose special function was the           supervision of foreign cults. This last accounts for Tacitus'           interest in strange religions.         [6] This project, also foreshadowed in _Agricola_ iii, was           never completed.

THE STATE OF THE EMPIRE    Before I commence my task, it seems best to go back and consider         4  the state of affairs in the city, the temper of the armies, the  condition of the provinces, and to determine the elements of strength  and weakness in the different quarters of the Roman world. By this  means we may see not only the actual course of events, which is  largely governed by chance, but also why and how they occurred.    The death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was  greeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the  senators, the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among the  generals and their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of state:  an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the senate was  satisfied. They had immediately taken advantage of their liberty and  were naturally emboldened against a prince who was new to the throne  and, moreover, absent. The highest class of the knights[9] seconded  the senate's satisfaction. Respectable citizens, who were attached as  clients or freedmen to the great families, and had seen their patrons  condemned or exiled, now revived their hopes. The lowest classes, who  had grown familiar with the pleasures of the theatre and the circus,  the most degraded of the slaves, and Nero's favourites who had  squandered their property and lived on his discreditable bounty, all  showed signs of depression and an eager greed for news.    The troops in the city[10] had long been inured to the allegiance        5  of the Caesars, and it was more by the pressure of intrigue than of  their own inclination that they came to desert Nero. They soon  realized that the donation promised in Galba's name was not to be paid  to them, and that peace would not, like war, offer opportunity for  great services and rich rewards. Since they also saw that the new  emperor's favour had been forestalled by the army which proclaimed  him, they were ripe for revolution and were further instigated by  their rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus, who was plotting to be  emperor himself. His design was as a matter of fact detected and  quashed, but, though the ringleader was removed, many of the troops  still felt conscious of their treason and could be heard commenting on  Galba's senility and avarice. His austerity--a quality once admired  and set high in soldiers' estimation--only annoyed troops whose  contempt for the old methods of discipline had been fostered by  fourteen years of service under Nero. They had come to love the  emperors' vices as much as they once reverenced their virtues in older  days. Moreover Galba had let fall a remark, which augured well for  Rome, though it spelt danger to himself. 'I do not buy my soldiers,'  he said, 'I select them.' And indeed, as things then stood, his words  sounded incongruous.    FOOTNOTES:         [9] Probably those who owned one million sesterces, the           property qualification for admission to the senate.        [10] This includes 'The Guards' (_cohortes praetoriae_) and           'The City Garrison' (_cohortes urbanae_), and possibly also           the _cohortes vigilum_, who were a sort of police corps and           fire brigade.      GALBA'S POSITION    Galba was old and ill. Of his two lieutenants Titus Vinius was the       6  vilest of men and Cornelius Laco the laziest. Hated as he was for  Vinius' crimes and despised for Laco's inefficiency, between them  Galba soon came to ruin. His march from Spain was slow and stained  with bloodshed. He executed Cingonius Varro, the consul-elect, and  Petronius Turpilianus, an ex-consul, the former as an accomplice of  Nymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's generals. They were both  denied any opportunity of a hearing or defence--and might as well have  been innocent. On his arrival at Rome the butchery of thousands of  unarmed soldiers[11] gave an ill omen to his entry, and alarmed even  the men who did the slaughter. The city was filled with strange  troops. A legion had been brought from Spain,[12] and the regiment of  marines enrolled by Nero still remained.[11] Moreover there were  several detachments from Germany, Britain, and Illyricum,[13] which  had been selected by Nero, dispatched to the Caspian Pass[14] for the  projected war against the Albanians, and subsequently recalled to aid  in crushing the revolt of Vindex.[15] These were all fine fuel for a  revolution, and, although their favour centred on nobody in  particular, there they were at the disposal of any one who had  enterprise.    It happened by chance that the news of the death of Clodius Macer        7  and of Fonteius Capito arrived in Rome simultaneously. Macer,[16] who  was undoubtedly raising a disturbance in Africa, was put to death by  the imperial agent Trebonius Garutianus, acting under Galba's orders:  Capito[17] had made a similar attempt in Germany and was killed by two  officers, Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens, without waiting for  instructions. While Capito had a foul reputation for extortion and  loose living, some people yet believed that he had withheld his hand  from treason. His officers, they supposed, had urged him to declare  war, and, when they could not persuade him, had gone on to charge him  falsely with their own offence,[18] while Galba from weakness of  character, or perhaps because he was afraid to inquire too far,  approved what had happened for good or for ill, since it was past  alteration. At any rate both executions were unpopular. Now that Galba  was disliked, everything he did, whether right or wrong, made him more  unpopular. His freedmen were all-powerful: money could do anything:  the slaves were thirsting for an upheaval, and with so elderly an  emperor were naturally expecting to see one soon. The evils of the new  court were those of the old, and while equally oppressive were not so  easily excused. Even Galba's age seemed comic and despicable to a  populace that was used to the young Nero and compared the emperors, as  such people will, in point of looks and personal attraction.
