His exploit \"in  that drowsy and inactive time ... was looked upon with general estimation,\"  says Clarendon. The King gave him a good welcome, but could not follow it  up with any special favour; for there were many complaints over the  business, and Scanderoon had to be repudiated.    But Digby could not be merely privateer, and in the Scanderoon expedition  we are privileged to look on the Pirate as a Man of Taste. His stay in  Florence had given him an interest in the fine arts; and at Milo and  Delphos he contrived to make some healthy exercise for his men serve the  avidity of the collector. Modern excavators will read with horror of his  methods. \"I went with most of my shippes to Delphos, a desert island, where  staying till the rest were readie, because idlenesse should not fixe their  mindes upon any untoward fansies (as is usuall among seamen), and together  to avayle myselfe of the convenience of carrying away some antiquities  there, I busied them in rolling of stones doune to the see side, which they  did with such eagernesse as though it had been the earnestest business that  they had come out for, and they mastered prodigious massie weightes; but  one stone, the greatest and fairest of all, containing four statues, they  gave over after they had been, 300 men, a whole day about it.... But the  next day I contrived a way with mastes of shippes and another shippe to  ride over against it, that brought it doune with much ease and speede\"!  What became of this treasure so heroically acquired?    So much for art. Literature was to have its turn with the versatile pirate  ere he reached his native shores. During a time of forced inaction at Milo,  he began to write his _Memoirs_. A great commander was expected during a  truce, it appears, to pay lavish attentions to the native ladies. Neglect  of this gallantry was construed almost as a national insult. Sir Kenelm,  faithful to his Venetia, excused himself on the plea of much business. But  he had little or no business; and he used his retirement to pen the amazing  account of his early life and his love story, where he appears as Theagenes  and his wife as Stelliana, as strange a mixture of rhodomontade and real  romance as exists among the autobiographies of the world. Of course it does  not represent Digby at his maturity. Among his MSS. the _Memoirs_ were  found with the title of _Loose Fantasies_, and they were not printed till  1827.    It was quite a minor post in the Navy he received in recognition of  Scanderoon, and one wonders why he took it. Perhaps to gain experience, of  which he was always greedy. Or Scanderoon may have emptied his treasuries.  After the Restoration he had a hard struggle to get repaid for his ransom  of slaves on the Algerian coast. At any rate, as Naval Commissioner he  earned the reputation of a hard-working public servant.    If his constantly-changing life can be said to have had a turning-point, it  occurred in 1633, when his wife died suddenly. The death of the lovely  Venetia was the signal for a great outburst of vile poetry on her beauty  and merits. Ben Jonson, her loyal friend and Kenelm's, wrote several  elegies, one of them the worst. Vandyck painted her several times; and so  the memory of her loveliness is secure. As to her virtues, amiability  seems to have been of their number. \"Unmatcht for beauty, chaster than the  ayre,\" wrote one poet. When they opened her head it was discovered she had  little brain; and gossip attributed the fact to her having drunk  viper-wine--by her husband's advice--for her complexion. This sounds absurd  only to those who have not perused the _Receipts in Physick and  Chirurgery_. Little brain or not, her husband praised her wits. Ben Jonson  wrote with devotion of her \"who was my muse, and life of all I did.\"    Digby imitated his father-in-law who, in similar circumstances, gave  himself up to solitude and recollection. His place of retirement was  Gresham College. Do its present students remember it once housed a hermit  who \"wore a long mourning cloake, a high crowned hat, his beard unshorne  ... as signes of sorrowe for his beloved wife\"? There \"he diverted himself  with chymistry and the professor's good conversation.\" He had \"a fair and  large laboratory ... erected under the lodgings of the Divinity Reader.\"  Hans Hunneades the Hungarian was his operator.    But another influence was at work. For the first time his mind turned  seriously to religion. Romanist friends were persuading him to his father's  faith. His old tutor Laud and other Protestants were doing their best to  settle him on their side. Out of the struggle of choice he came, in 1636, a  fervent and convinced Catholic. He was to prove his devotion over and over  again; but I fear that Catholics of to-day would view with suspicion his  views on ecclesiastical authority. In his dedication of his _Treatise on  the Soul_ to his son Kenelm, there is a spirited defence of the right, of  the intelligent to private judgment in matters of doctrine. Nevertheless,  his Catholicism, though rationalist, was sincere, and he spent much energy  in propaganda among his friends--witness his rather dull little brochure,  the _Conference with a Lady about Choice of Religion_ (1638), and his  correspondence with his kinsman, Lord Digby, who did, indeed, later, come  over to the older faith. Ere long he earned the reputation of being \"not  only an open but a busy Papist,\" though \"an eager enemy to the Jesuits.\"    From this time dates his close friendship with the Queen, Henrietta Maria,  and her Catholic friends, Sir Tobie Matthew, Endymion Porter, and Walter  Montague. He and Montague were specially chosen by the Queen to appeal to  the English Catholics for aid towards Charles's campaign in Scotland. Digby  was certainly a hot inciter of the King to foolish activity; but in the  light of his after history, it would seem always with a view to the  complete freedom of the Catholic religion. A prominent King's man, nay, a  Queen's man, which was held to be something extremer, he played, however,  an individual part in the struggle. He was well fitted for the Cavalier  role by the magnificence of his person, by his splendid hospitality, his  contempt for sects, his aristocratic instincts, and his manner of the Great  World. But if he liked good cheer and a great way of living, he is never to  be imagined as clinking cans with a \"Hey for Cavaliers! Ho for Cavaliers!\"  He never fought for the King's cause--though he fought a duel in Paris with  a French lord who took Charles's name in vain, and killed his man too. His  role was always the intellectual one. He conspired for the cause--chiefly,  I think, out of personal friendship, and because he held it to be the cause  of his Church. He was not a virulent politician; and on the question of  divine right the orthodox Cavaliers must have felt him to be very unsound  indeed.    The era of Parliaments had now come, and Digby was to feel it. He was  summoned to the bar of the House as a Popish recusant. Charles was ordered  to banish him and Montague from his councils and his presence; and their  examination continued at intervals till the middle of 1642. The Queen  interceded for Digby with much warmth, but she was a dangerous friend; and  in the same year Montague and he were sent to prison. I have heard a  tradition that Crosby Hall was for a time his comfortable jail, but can  find no corroboration of this. The serjeant-at-arms confined him for a  brief space at The Three Tuns, near Charing Cross, \"where his conversation  made the prison a place of delight\" to his fellows. Later, at Winchester  House, Southwark, where he remained in honourable confinement for two  years, he was busy with writing and experimenting--to preserve him from \"a  languishing and rusting leisure.\" Two pamphlets, both of them hasty  improvisations, one a philosophic commentary on a certain stanza of the  _Faerie Queen_, the other, his well-known _Observations on the 'Religio  Medici'_, are but mere bubbles of this seething activity, given over mostly  to the preparation of his _Two Treatises_, \"Of the Body,\" and \"Of the  Soul,\" published later in Paris, and to experiments on glass-making.    Many efforts were made for his release, the most efficacious by the Queen  of France. It should have been the Dowager Marie de Medicis, in memory of  her hot flame for him when he was a youth; but though she may have  initiated the appeal, she died before his release, which he seems to have  owed to Anne of Austria's good services. Freedom meant banishment, but this  sentence he did not take very seriously. In these years he was continually  going and coming between France and England, now warned by Parliament, now  tolerated, now banished, again daring return, and escaping from the net. \"I  can compare him to nothing but to a great fish that we catch and let go  again; but still he will come to the bait,\" said Selden of him in his  _Table-Talk_.    Exile in Paris provided fresh opportunity for scientific study, though his  connection with the English Catholic malcontents, and his services to the  Queen Henrietta Maria, who now made him her Chancellor, absorbed much of  his time. When the Cause needed him, the Cavalier broke away from  philosophy; and in 1645 he set out for Rome, at the bidding of the Queen,  to beg money for her schemes. With all his address, diplomacy was not among  the chief of his talents. With high personages he took a high tone.  Innocent X gave 10,000 crowns to the Cause; but they quarrelled; and the  Pope went so far as to accuse Digby of misappropriation of the money.  Digby, a man of clean hands, seems to have taken up the Queen's quarrel.

The outline of the present situation in India is that we have  been disseminating ideas of abstract political right, and the germs of  representative institutions, among a people that had for centuries been  governed autocratically, and in a country where local liberties and  habits of self-government had been long obliterated or had never  existed. At the same time we have been spreading modern education  broadcast throughout the land, where, before English rule, learning had  not advanced beyond the stage of Europe in the middle ages. These may  be taken to be the primary causes of the existing Unrest; and meanwhile  the administrative machine has been so efficiently organized, it has  run, hitherto, so easily and quietly, as to disguise from inexperienced  bystanders the long discipline and training in affairs of State that are  required for its management. Nor is it clearly perceived that the real  driving power lies in the forces held in reserve by the British nation  and in the respect which British guardianship everywhere commands. That  Indians should be liberally invited to share the responsibilities of  high office is now a recognized principle of public policy. But the  process of initiation must be gradual and tentative; and vague notions  of dissolving the British connexion only prove incompetence to realize  the whole situation, external and internal, of the country. Across the  frontiers of India are warlike nations, who are intent upon arming  themselves after the latest modern pattern, though for the other  benefits of Western science and learning they show, as yet, very little  taste or inclination. They would certainly be a serious menace to a weak  Government in the Indian plains, while their sympathy with a literary  class would be uncommonly slight. Against intruders of this sort the  British hold securely the gates of India; and it must be clear that the  civilization and future prosperity of the whole country depend entirely  upon their determination to maintain public tranquillity by strict  enforcement of the laws; combined with their policy of admitting the  highest intellects and capacities to the Councils of the State, and of  assigning reasonable administrative and legislative independence to the  great provinces in accord with the unity of a powerful Empire.    A.C. LYALL          CHAPTER I.    A GENERAL SURVEY.      That there is a lull in the storm of unrest which has lately swept over  India is happily beyond doubt. Does this lull indicate a gradual and  steady return to more normal and peaceful conditions? Or, as in other  cyclonic disturbances in tropical climes, does it merely presage fiercer  outbursts yet to come? Has the blended policy of repression and  concession adopted by Lord Morley and Lord Minto really cowed the forces  of criminal disorder and rallied the representatives of moderate opinion  to the cause of sober and Constitutional progress? Or has it come too  late either permanently to arrest the former or to restore confidence  and courage to the latter?    These are the two questions which the present situation in India most  frequently and obviously suggests, but it may be doubted whether they by  any means cover the whole field of potential developments. They are  based apparently upon the assumption that Indian unrest, even in its  most extreme forms, is merely the expression of certain political  aspirations towards various degrees of emancipation from British  tutelage, ranging from a larger share in the present system of  administration to a complete revolution in the existing relations  between Great Britain and India, and that, the issues thus raised being  essentially political, they can be met by compromise on purely political  lines. This assumption ignores, I fear, certain factors of very great  importance, social, religious, and economic, which profoundly affect, if  they do not altogether overshadow, the political problem. The question  to which I propose to address myself is whether Indian unrest represents  merely, as we are prone to imagine, the human and not unnatural  impatience of subject races fretting under an alien rule which, however  well intentioned, must often be irksome and must sometimes appear to be  harsh and arbitrary; or whether to-day, in its more extreme forms at any  rate, it does not represent an irreconcilable reaction against all that  not only British rule but Western civilization stands for.    I will not stop at present to discuss how far the lamentable  deficiencies of the system of education which we have ourselves  introduced into India have contributed to the Indian unrest. That that  system has been productive of much good few will deny, but few also can  be so blind as to ignore the fact that it tends on the one hand to  create a semi-educated proletariate, unemployed and largely  unemployable, and on the other hand, even where failure is less  complete, to produce dangerous hybrids, more or less superficially  imbued with Western ideas, and at the same time more or less completely  divorced from the realities of Indian life. Many other circumstances  also which have helped the promoters of disaffection I must reserve for  subsequent discussion. Some of them are economic, such as the remarkable  rise in prices during the last decade. This has seriously enhanced the  cost of living in India and has specially affected the very classes  amongst whom disaffection is most widespread. The clerk, the teacher,  the petty Government official, whose exiguous salaries have remained the  same, find themselves to-day relatively, and in many cases actually,  worse off than the artisan or even the labourer, whose wages have in  many cases risen in proportion to the increased cost of living. Plague,  which in the course of the last 14 years has carried off over 6,000,000  people, and two terrible visitations of famine have caused in different  parts of the country untold misery and consequent bitterness. On the  other hand, the growth of commerce and industry and the growing interest  taken by all classes in commercial and industrial questions have led to  a corresponding resentment of the fiscal restraints placed upon India by  the Imperial Government for the selfish benefit, as it is contended, of  the British manufacturer and trader. Much bad blood has undoubtedly been  created by the treatment of British Indians in South Africa and the  attitude adopted in British Colonies generally towards Asiatic  immigrants. The social relations between the two races in India  itself--always a problem of infinite difficulty--have certainly not been  improved by the large influx of a lower class of Europeans which the  development of railways and telegraphs and other industries requiring  technical knowledge have brought in their train. Nor can it be denied  that the growing pressure of office work as well as the increased  facilities of home leave and frequent transfers from one post to another  have inevitably to some extent lessened the contact between the  Anglo-Indian official and the native population. Of more remote  influences which have indirectly reacted upon the Indian mind it may  suffice for the present to mention the South African War, which lowered  the prestige of our arms, and the Russo-Japanese War, which was regarded  as the first blow dealt to the ascendency of Europe over Asia, though it  may be worth noting that in his novel, \"The Prince of Destiny,\" Mr. Surat  Kumar Ghosh lays repeated emphasis on the impression produced in India  some years earlier by the defeat of the Italian forces in Abyssinia.  Each of the above points has its own importance and deserves to be  closely studied, for upon the way in which we shall in the future handle  some of the delicate questions which they raise will largely depend our  failure or our success in coping with Indian unrest--that is, in  preventing its invasion of other classes than those to which it has been  hitherto confined. But the clue to the real spirit which informs Indian  unrest must be sought elsewhere.    Two misconceptions appear to prevail very widely at home with regard to  the nature of the unrest. The first is that disaffection of a virulent  and articulate character is a new phenomenon in India; the second is  that the existing: disaffection represents a genuine, if precocious and  misdirected, response on the part of the Western educated classes to the  democratic ideals of the modern Western world which our system of  education has imported into India. It is easy to account for the  prevalence of both these misconceptions. We are a people of notoriously  short memory, and, when a series of sensational dastardly crimes,  following on a tumultuous agitation in Bengal and a campaign of  incredible violence in the native Press, at last aroused and alarmed the  British public, the vast majority of Englishmen were under the  impression that since the black days of the Mutiny law and order had  never been seriously assailed in India, and they therefore rushed to the  conclusion that, if the _pax Britannica_ had been so rudely and suddenly  shaken, the only possible explanation lay in some novel wave of  sentiment or some grievous administrative blunder which had abruptly  disturbed the harmonious relations between the rulers and the ruled.  People had forgotten that disaffection in varying forms and degrees of  intensity has existed at all times amongst certain sections of the  population, and under the conditions of our rule can hardly be expected  to disappear altogether. Whether British statesmanship has always  sufficiently reckoned with its existence is another question. More than  30 years ago, for instance, the Government of India had to pass a Bill  dealing with the aggressive violence of the vernacular Press on  precisely the same grounds that were alleged "]]]
