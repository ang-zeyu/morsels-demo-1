The cost of surveillance will be minimum and the  general expenses _ad libitum_.    Let us take the case in which the energy has to be borrowed from a  steam engine. Supposing very small losses in the dynamo and piping, we  may count upon a production of one cubic meter of hydrogen and 500  cubic decimeters of oxygen for 10 horse-power taken upon the main  shaft, say an expenditure of 10 kilogrammes of coal or of about 25  centimes--a little more in Paris, and less in coal districts. If,  consequently, we fix the price of the cubic meter of gas at 50  centimes, we shall preserve a sufficient margin. In localities where a  natural motive power is at our disposal, this estimate will have to be  greatly reduced. We may, therefore, expect to see hydrogen and oxygen  take an important place in ordinary usages. From the standpoint alone  of preservation of fuel, that is to say, of potential energy upon the  earth, this new conquest of electricity is very pleasing. Waterfalls  furnish utilizable energy in every locality, and, in the future, will  perhaps console our great-grandchildren for the unsparing waste that  we are making of coal.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *    [Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 818, page 13066.]          MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND CAPABILITIES.    By A.J. HIPKINS, F.S.A.    LECTURE II.      I will now invite your attention to the wind instruments, which, in  Handel's time, were chiefly used to double in unison the parts of  stringed instruments. Their modern independent use dates from Haydn;  it was extended and perfected by Mozart, Beethoven, and Weber; and the  extraordinary changes and improvements which have been effected during  the present century have given wind instruments an importance that is  hardly exceeded by that of the stringed, in the formation of the  modern orchestra. The military band, as it now exists, is a creation  of the present century.    The so-called wood wind instruments are the flute, oboe, bassoon, and  clarinet. It is as well to say at once that their particular qualities  of tone do not absolutely depend upon the materials of which they are  made. The form is the most important factor in determining the  distinction of tone quality, so long as the sides of the tube are  equally elastic, as has been submitted to proof by instruments made of  various materials, including paper. I consider this has been  sufficiently demonstrated by the independent experiments of Mr.  Blaikley, of London, and Mr. Victor Mahillon, of Brussels. But we must  still allow Mr. Richard Shepherd Rockstro's plea, clearly set forth in  a recently published treatise on the flute, that the nature and the  substance of the tube, by reciprocity of vibration, exercise some  influence, although not so great as might have been expected, on the  quality of the tone. But I consider this influence is already  acknowledged in my reference to equality of elasticity in the sides of  the tube.    The flute is an instrument of _embouchure_--that is to say, one in  which a stream of air is driven from the player's lips against an edge  of the blow hole to produce the sound. The oboe and bassoon have  double reeds, and the clarinet a single reed, made of a species of  cane, as intermediate agents of sound production. There are other  flutes than that of _embouchure_--those with flageolet or whistle  heads, which, having become obsolete, shall be reserved for later  notice. There are no real tenor or bass flutes now, those in use being  restricted to the upper part of the scale. The present flute dates  from 1832, when Theobald Boehm, a Bavarian flute player, produced the  instrument which is known by his name. He entirely remodeled the  flute, being impelled to do so by suggestions from the performance of  the English flautist, Charles Nicholson, who had increased the  diameter of the lateral holes, and by some improvements that had been  attempted in the flute by a Captain Gordon, of Charles the Tenth's  Swiss Guard. Boehm has been sufficiently vindicated from having  unfairly appropriated Gordon's ideas. The Boehm flute, since 1846, is  a cylindrical tube for about three-fourths of its length from the  lower end, after which it is continued in a curved conical  prolongation to the cork stopper. The finger holes are disposed in a  geometrical division, and the mechanism and position of the keys are  entirely different from what had been before. The full compass of the  Boehm flute is chromatic, from middle C to C, two octaves above the  treble clef C, a range of three octaves, which is common to all  concert flutes, and is not peculiar to the Boehm model. Of course this  compass is partly produced by altering the pressure of blowing.  Columns of air inclosed in pipes vibrate like strings in sections,  but, unlike strings, the vibrations progress in the direction of  length, not across the direction of length. In the flute, all notes  below D, in the treble clef, are produced by the normal pressure of  wind; by an increasing pressure of overblowing the harmonics, D in the  treble clef, and A and B above it, are successively attained. The  fingerholes and keys, by shortening the tube, fill up the required  intervals of the scale. There are higher harmonics still, but  flautists generally prefer to do without them when they can get the  note required by a lower harmonic. In Boehm's flute, his ingenious  mechanism allows the production of the eleven chromatic semitones  intermediate between the fundamental note of the flute and its first  harmonic, by holes so disposed that, in opening them successively,  they shorten the column of air in exact proportion. It is, therefore,  ideally, an equal temperament instrument and not a D major one, as the  conical flute was considered to be. Perhaps the most important thing  Boehm did for the flute was to enunciate the principle that, to insure  purity of tone and correct intonation, the holes must be put in their  correct theoretical positions; and at least the hole below the one  giving he sound must be open, to insure perfect venting. Boehm's  flute, however, has not remained as he left it. Improvements, applied  by Clinton, Pratten, and Carte, have introduced certain modifications  in the fingering, while retaining the best features of Boehm's system.  But it seems to me that the reedy quality obtained from the adoption  of the cylindrical bore which now prevails does away with the sweet  and characteristic tone quality of the old conical German flute, and  gives us in its place one that is not sufficiently distinct from that  of the clarinet.    The flute is the most facile of all orchestral wind instruments; and  the device of double tonguing, the quick repetition of notes by taking  a staccato T-stop in blowing, is well known. The flute generally goes  with the violins in the orchestra, or sustains long notes with the  other wood wind instruments, or is used in those conversational  passages with other instruments that lend such a charm to orchestral  music. The lower notes are not powerful. Mr. Henry Carte has, however,  designed an alto flute in A, descending to violin G, with excellent  results. There is a flute which transposes a minor third higher than  the ordinary flute; but it is not much used in the orchestra, although  used in the army, as is also a flute one semitone higher than the  concert flute. The piccolo, or octave flute, is more employed in the  orchestra, and may double the melody in the highest octave, or  accentuate brilliant points of effect in the score. It is very shrill  and exciting in the overblown notes, and without great care may give a  vulgar character to the music, and for this reason Sir Arthur Sullivan  has replaced it in the score of \"Ivanhoe\" by a high G flute. The  piccolo is exactly an octave higher than the flute, excepting the two  lowest notes of which it is deficient. The old cylindrical  ear-piercing fife is an obsolete instrument, being superseded by a  small army flute, still, however, called a fife, used with the side  drum in the drum and fife band.    The transverse or German flute, introduced into the orchestra by  Lulli, came into general use in the time of Handel; before that the  recorders, or flute douces, the flute a bec with beak or whistle head,  were preferred. These instruments were used in a family, usually of  eight members, viz., as many sizes from treble to bass; or in three,  treble, alto or tenor, and bass. A fine original set of those now rare  instruments, eight in number, was shown in 1890 in the music gallery  of the Royal Military Exhibition, at Chelsea; a loan collection  admirably arranged by Captain C.B. Day. They were obtained from Hesse  Darmstadt, and had their outer case to preserve them exactly like the  recorder case represented in the painting by Holbein of the  ambassadors, or rather, the scholars, recently acquired for the  National Gallery. The flageolet was the latest form of the treble,  beak, or whistle head flute. The whistle head is furnished with a  cavity containing air, which, shaped by a narrow groove, strikes  against the sharp edge and excites vibration in the conical pipe, on  the same principle that an organ pipe is made to sound, or of the  action of the player's mouth and lips upon the blowhole of the flute.  As it will interest the audience to hear the tone of Shakespeare's  recorder, Mr. Henry Carte will play an air upon one.    The oboe takes the next place in the wood wind band. The principle of  sound excitement, that of the double reed, originating in the  flattening of the end of an oat or wheat straw, is of great antiquity,  but it could only be applied by insertion in tubes of very narrow  diameter, so that the column of air should not be wider than the  tongue straw or reed acting upon it. The little reed bound round and  contracted below the vibrating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#3)"],[1,"human, could have treated his own motherless  boy with such severity. The Archdeacon acted, no doubt, upon a  theory, the theory that sternness to children is the truest kindness  in the long run.    Well might Macaulay say that he would rather a boy should learn to  lisp all the bad words in the language than grow up without a  mother. Froude's interrupted studies were nothing compared to a  childhood without love, and there was nobody to make him feel the  meaning of the word. Fortunately, though his father was always at  home, his brother was much away, and he was a good deal left to  himself after Robert's death. Hurrell did not disdain to employ him  in translating John of Salisbury's letters for his own Life of Becket.  No more was heard of the tanner, who had perhaps been only a threat.  While he wandered in solitude through the woods, or by the river,  his health improved, he acquired a passion for nature, and in his  father's library, which was excellent, he began eagerly to read. He  devoured Sharon Turner's History of England, and the great work of  Gibbon. Shakespeare and Spenser introduced him to the region of the  spirit in its highest and deepest, its purest and noblest forms.  Unhappily he also fell in with Byron, the worst poet that can come  into the hands of a boy, and always retained for him an admiration  which would now be thought excessive. By these means he gained much.  He discovered what poetry was, what history was, and he learned also  the lesson that no one can teach, the hard lesson of self-reliance.    This was the period, as everybody knows, of the Oxford Movement, in  which Hurrell Froude acted as a pioneer. Hurrell's ideal was the  Church of the Middle Ages represented by Thomas Becket. In the  vacations he brought some of his Tractarian friends home with him,  and Anthony listened to their talk. Strange talk it seemed. They  found out, these young men, that Dr. Arnold, one of the most  devoutly religious men who ever lived, was not a Christian. The  Reformation was an infamous rebellion against authority. Liberalism,  not the Pope, was  antichrist. The Church was above the State, and  the supreme ruler of the world. Transubstantiation, which the  Archdeacon abhorred, was probably true. Hurrell Froude was a  brilliant talker, a consummate dialectician, and an ardent  proselytising controversialist. But his young listener knew a little  history, and perceived that, to put it mildly, there were gaps in  Hurrell's knowledge.    When he heard that the Huguenots were despicable, that Charles I.  was a saint, that the Old Pretender was James III., that the  Revolution of 1688 was a crime, and that the Non-jurors were the  true confessors of the English Church, it did not seem to square  with his reading, or his reflections. Perhaps, after all, the  infallible Hurrell might be wrong. One fear he had never been able  to instil into his brother, and that was the fear of death. When  asked what would happen if he were suddenly called to appear in the  presence of God, Anthony replied that he was in the presence of God  from morning to night and from night to morning. That abiding  consciousness he never lost, and when his speculations went furthest  they invariably stopped there.    Left with his father and one sister, the boy drank in the air of  Dartmoor, and grew to love Devonshire with an unalterable affection.  He also continued his reading, and invaded theology. Newton on the  Prophecies remarked that \"if the Pope was not Antichrist, he had bad  luck to be so like him,\" and Renan had not yet explained that  Antichrist was neither the Pope nor the French Revolution, but the  Emperor Nero. From Pearson on the Creed he learned the distinction  between \"believing\" and \"believing in.\" When we believe in a person,  we trust him. When we believe a thing, we are not sure of it. This  is one of the few theological distinctions which are also  differences. Meanwhile, the Archdeacon had been watching his  youngest son, and had observed that he had at least a taste for  books. Perhaps he might not be the absolute dolt that Hurrell  pronounced him. He had lost five years, so far as classical training  was concerned, by the mismanagement of the Archdeacon himself.  Still, he was only seventeen, and there was time to repair the  waste. He was sent to a private tutor's in preparation for Oxford.  His tutor, a dreamy, poetical High Churchman, devoted to Wordsworth  and Keble, failed to understand his character or to give him an  interest in his work, and a sixth year was added to the lost five.    During this year his brother Hurrell died, and the tragic extinction  of that commanding spirit seemed a presage of his own early doom.  Two of his sisters, both lately married, died within a few months of  Hurrell, and of each other. The Archdeacon, incapable of expressing  emotion, became more reserved than ever, and scarcely spoke at all.  Sadly was he disappointed in his children. Most of them went out of  the world long before him. Not one of them distinguished himself in  those regular professional courses which alone he understood as  success. Hurrell joined ardently, while his life was spared, in the  effort to counteract the Reformation and Romanise the Church of  England. William, though he became a naval architect of the highest  possible distinction, and performed invaluable services for his  country, worked on his own account, and made his own experiments in  his own fashion. Anthony, too, took his line, and went his way,  whither his genius led him, indifferent to the opinion of the world.  His had been a strange childhood, not without its redeeming  features. Left to himself, seeing his brothers and sisters die  around him, expecting soon to follow them, the boy grew up stern,  hardy, and self-reliant. He was by no means a bookworm. He had  learned to ride in the best mode, by falling off, and had acquired a  passion for fishing which lasted as long as his life. There were few  better yachtsmen in England than Froude, and he could manage a boat  as well as any sailor in his native county. His religious education,  as he always said himself, was thoroughly wholesome and sound,  consisting of morality and the Bible. Sympathy no doubt he missed,  and he used to regard the early death of his brother Robert as the  loss of his best friend. For his father's character he had a  profound admiration as an embodiment of all the manly virtues,  stoical rather than Christian, never mawkish nor effeminate.      CHAPTER II    OXFORD    Westminster, it will have been seen, did less than nothing for  Froude. His progress there was no progress at all, but a movement  backwards, physical and mental deterioration. He recovered himself  at home, his father's coldness and unkindness notwithstanding. But  it was not until he went to Oxford that his real intellectual life  began, and that he realised his own powers. In October, 1836, four  months after Hurrell's death, he came into residence at Oriel. That  distinguished society was then at the climax of its fame; Dr. Hawkins  was beginning his long career as Provost; Newman and Church were  Fellows; the Oriel Common Room had a reputation unrivalled in Oxford,  and was famous far beyond the precincts of the University. But of  these circumstances Froude thought little, or nothing. He  felt free. For the first time in his life the means of social  intercourse and enjoyment were at his disposal. His internal  weakness had been overcome, and his health, in spite of all he had  gone through, was good. He had an ample allowance, and facilities  for spending it among pleasant companions in agreeable ways. He had  shot up to his full height, five feet eleven inches, and from his  handsome features there shone those piercing dark eyes which riveted  attention where-ever they were turned. His loveless, cheerless  boyhood was over, and the liberty of Oxford, which, even after the  mild constraint of a public school, seems boundless, was to him the  perfection of bliss. He began to develop those powers of  conversation which in after years gave him an irresistible influence  over men and women, young and old. Convinced that, like his brothers  and sisters, he had but a short time to live, and having  certainly been full of misery, he resolved to make the best of his  time, and enjoy himself while he could. He was under no obligation  to any one, unless it were to the Archdeacon for his pocket-money.  His father and his brother, doubtless with the best intentions, had  made life more painful for him after his mother's death than they  could have made it if she had been alive. But Hurrell was gone, his  father was in Devonshire, and he could do as he pleased. He lived  with the idle set in college; riding, boating, and playing tennis,  frequenting wines and suppers. From vicious excess his intellect and  temperament preserved him. Deep down in his nature there was a  strong Puritan element, to which his senses were subdued.  Nevertheless, for two years he lived at Oxford in contented  idleness, saying with Isaiah, and more literally than the prophet,    \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\"    It was a wholly unreformed Oxford to which Froude came. If it  \"breathed the last enchantments of the Middle Age,\" it was mediaeval  in its system too, and the most active spirits of the place, the  leaders of the Oxford Movement, were frank reactionaries, who hated  the very name of reform. Even a reduction in the monstrous number of  Irish Bishoprics pertaining to the establishment was indignantly  denounced as sacrilege, and was the immediate cause of Keble's  sermon on National Apostasy to which the famous \"movement\" has been  traced. John Henry Newman was at that time residing in Oriel, not as  a tutor, but as Vicar of St. Mary's. He was kind to Froude for  Hurrell's sake, and introduced him to the reading set. The  fascination of his character acted at once"]]]
