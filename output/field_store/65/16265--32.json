In fact many such sailors were soon liberated, but a  large number either continued to serve on British ships or to languish  in British prisons until the end of the Napoleonic Wars[6].    There were other, possibly greater, causes of the War of 1812, most of  them arising out of the conflicting interests of the chief maritime  neutral and the chief naval belligerent. The pacific presidential  administration of Jefferson sought by trade restrictions, using embargo  and non-intercourse acts, to bring pressure on both England and France,  hoping to force a better treatment of neutrals. The United States,  divided in sympathy between the belligerents, came near to disorder and  disruption at home, over the question of foreign policy. But through all  American factions there ran the feeling of growing animosity to Great  Britain because of impressment. At last, war was declared by America in  1812 and though at the moment bitterly opposed by one section, New  England, that war later came to be regarded as of great national value  as one of the factors which welded the discordant states into a national  unity. Naturally also, the war once ended, its commercial causes were  quickly forgotten, whereas the individual, personal offence involved in  impressment and right of search, with its insult to national pride,  became a patriotic theme for politicians and for the press. To deny, in  fact, a British \"right of search\" became a national point of honour,  upon which no American statesman would have dared to yield to British  overtures.    In American eyes the War of 1812 appears as a \"second war of  Independence\" and also as of international importance in contesting an  unjust use by Britain of her control of the seas. Also, it is to be  remembered that no other war of importance was fought by America until  the Mexican War of 1846, and militant patriotism was thus centred on the  two wars fought against Great Britain. The contemporary British view  was that of a nation involved in a life and death struggle with a great  European enemy, irritated by what seemed captious claims, developed to  war, by a minor power[7]. To be sure there were a few obstinate Tories  in Britain who saw in the war the opportunity of smashing at one blow  Napoleon's dream of empire, and the American \"democratic system.\" The  London _Times_ urged the government to \"finish with Mr. Bonaparte and  then deal with Mr. Madison and democracy,\" arguing that it should be  England's object to subvert \"the whole system of the Jeffersonian  school.\" But this was not the purpose of the British Government, nor  would such a purpose have been tolerated by the small but vigorous Whig  minority in Parliament.    The peace of 1814, signed at Ghent, merely declared an end of the war,  quietly ignoring all the alleged causes of the conflict. Impressment was  not mentioned, but it was never again resorted to by Great Britain upon  American ships. But the principle of right of search in time of peace,  though for another object than impressment, was soon again asserted by  Great Britain and for forty years was a cause of constant irritation and  a source of danger in the relations of the two countries. Stirred by  philanthropic emotion Great Britain entered upon a world crusade for the  suppression of the African Slave Trade. All nations in principle  repudiated that trade and Britain made treaties with various maritime  powers giving mutual right of search to the naval vessels of each upon  the others' merchant vessels. The African Slave Trade was in fact  outlawed for the flags of all nations. But America, smarting under the  memory of impressment injuries, and maintaining in any case the doctrine  that in time of peace the national flag protected a vessel from  interference or search by the naval vessels of any other power, refused  to sign mutual right of search treaties and denied, absolutely, such a  right for any cause whatever to Great Britain or to any other nation.  Being refused a treaty, Britain merely renewed her assertion of the  right and continued to exercise it.    Thus the right of search in time of peace controversy was not ended with  the war of 1812 but remained a constant sore in national relations, for  Britain alone used her navy with energy to suppress the slave trade, and  the slave traders of all nations sought refuge, when approached by a  British naval vessel, under the protection of the American flag. If  Britain respected the flag, and sheered off from search, how could she  stop the trade? If she ignored the flag and on boarding found an  innocent American vessel engaged in legal trade, there resulted claims  for damages by detention of voyage, and demands by the American  Government for apology and reparation. The real slave trader, seized  under the American flag, never protested to the United States, nor  claimed American citizenship, for his punishment in American law for  engaging in the slave trade was death, while under the law of any other  nation it did not exceed imprisonment, fine and loss of his vessel.    Summed up in terms of governmental attitude the British contention was  that here was a great international humanitarian object frustrated by an  absurd American sensitiveness on a point of honour about the flag. After  fifteen years of dispute Great Britain offered to abandon any claim to a  right of _search_, contenting herself with a right of _visit_, merely to  verify a vessel's right to fly the American flag. America asserted this  to be mere pretence, involving no renunciation of a practice whose  legality she denied. In 1842, in the treaty settling the Maine boundary  controversy, the eighth article sought a method of escape. Joint  cruising squadrons were provided for the coast of Africa, the British  to search all suspected vessels except those flying the American flag,  and these to be searched by the American squadron. At once President  Tyler notified Congress that Great Britain had renounced the right of  search. Immediately in Parliament a clamour was raised against the  Government for the \"sacrifice\" of a British right at sea, and Lord  Aberdeen promptly made official disclaimer of such surrender.    Thus, heritage of the War of 1812 right of search in time of peace was a  steady irritant. America doubted somewhat the honesty of Great Britain,  appreciating in part the humanitarian purpose, but suspicious of an  ulterior \"will to rule the seas.\" After 1830 no American political  leader would have dared to yield the right of search. Great Britain for  her part, viewing the expansion of domestic slavery in the United  States, came gradually to attribute the American contention, not to  patriotic pride, but to the selfish business interests of the  slave-holding states. In the end, in 1858, with a waning British  enthusiasm for the cause of slave trade suppression, and with  recognition that America had become a great world power, Britain yielded  her claim to right of search or visit, save when established by Treaty.  Four years later, in 1862, it may well have seemed to British statesmen  that American slavery had indeed been the basic cause of America's  attitude, for in that year a treaty was signed by the two nations giving  mutual right of search for the suppression of the African Slave Trade.  In fact, however, this was but an effort by Seward, Secretary of State  for the North, to influence British and European opinion against the  seceding slave states of the South.    The right of search controversy was, in truth, ended when American power  reached a point where the British Government must take it seriously into  account as a factor in general world policy. That power had been  steadily and rapidly advancing since 1814. From almost the first moment  of established independence American statesmen visualized the  separation of the interests of the western continent from those of  Europe, and planned for American leadership in this new world.  Washington, the first President, emphasized in his farewell address the  danger of entangling alliances with Europe. For long the nations of  Europe, immersed in Continental wars, put aside their rivalries in this  new world. Britain, for a time, neglected colonial expansion westward,  but in 1823, in an emergency of European origin when France,  commissioned by the great powers of continental Europe, intervened in  Spain to restore the deposed Bourbon monarchy and seemed about to  intervene in Spanish America to restore to Spain her revolted colonies,  there developed in Great Britain a policy, seemingly about to draw  America and England into closer co-operation. Canning, for Britain,  proposed to America a joint declaration against French intervention in  the Americas. His argument was against the principle of intervention;  his immediate motive was a fear of French colonial expansion; but his  ultimate object was inheritance by Britain of Spain's dying influence  and position in the new world.    Canning's overture was earnestly considered in America. The  ex-Presidents, Jefferson and Madison, recommended its acceptance, but  the Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, opposed this, favouring  rather a separate declaration by the United States, and of this opinion  was also President Monroe. Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine announcing  American opposition to the principle of \"intervention,\" and declaring  that the American continents were no longer to be regarded as open to  further colonization by European nations. The British emergency  situation with France, though already quieted, caused Monroe's Message  to be greeted in England with high approval. But Canning did not so  approve it for he saw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13791"],[0,"Psychology and Achievement (#3)"],[1,"business or  profession.    But mark this word of warning.

TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT          CHAPTER II    TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT      [Sidenote: The One-Man Business Corporation]    As a working unit you are a kind of one-man business corporation made up  of two departments, the mental and the physical.    Your mind is the executive office of this personal corporation, its  directing \"head.\" Your body is the corporation's \"plant.\" Eyes and ears,  sight and smell and touch, hands and feet--these are the implements, the  equipment.    We have undertaken to teach you how to acquire a perfect mastery of your  own powers and meet the practical problems of your life in such a way  that success will be swift and certain.    [Sidenote: Business and Bodily Activity]    First of all it is necessary that you should accept and believe two  well-settled and fundamental laws.    I. _All human achievement comes about through bodily activity._    II. _All bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the  mind._    Give the first of these propositions but a moment's thought. You can  conceive of no form of accomplishment which is not the result of some  kind of bodily activity. One would say that the master works of poetry,  art, philosophy, religion, are products of human effort furthest  removed from the material side of life, yet even these would have  perished still-born in the minds conceiving them had they not found  transmission and expression through some form of bodily activity. You  will agree, therefore, that the first of these propositions is so  self-evident, so axiomatic, as neither to require nor to admit of formal  proof.    The second proposition is not so easily disposed of. It is in fact so  difficult of acceptance by some persons that we must make very plain its  absolute validity. Furthermore, its elucidation will bring forth many  illuminating facts that will give you an entirely new conception of the  mind and its scope and influence.    [Sidenote: The Enslaved Brain]    Remember, when we say \"mind,\" we are not thinking of the brain. The  brain is but one of the organs of the body, and, by the terms of our  proposition as stated, is as much the slave of the mind as is any other  organ of the body. To say that the mind controls the body presupposes  that mind and body are distinct entities, the one belonging to a  spiritual world, the other to a world of matter.    That the mind is master of the body is a settled principle of science.  But we realize that its acceptance may require you to lay aside some  preconceived prejudices. You may be one of those who believe that the  mind is nothing more nor less than brain activity. You may believe that  the body is all there is to man and that mind-action is merely one of  its functions.    [Sidenote: First Step Toward Self-Realization]    If so, we want you nevertheless to realize that, while as a matter of  philosophic speculation you retain these opinions, you may at the same  time for practical purposes regard the mind as an independent causal  agency and believe that it can and does control and determine and  _cause_ any and every kind of bodily activity. We want you to do this  because this conclusion is at the basis of a practical system of mental  efficiency and because, as we shall at once show you, it is capable of  proof by the established methods of physical science.          RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY          CHAPTER III    RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY    POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH YOU MUST APPROACH THIS PROBLEM      [Sidenote: Speculation and Practical Science]    The fact is, one's opinion as to whether mind controls body or body  makes mind-action depends altogether upon the point of view. And the  first step for us to take is to agree upon the point of view we shall  assume.    Two points of view are possible. One is _speculative_, the other  _practical_.    [Sidenote: Philosophic Riddles and Personal Effectiveness]    The _speculative point of view_ is that of the philosopher and  religionist, who ponder the tie that binds \"soul\" and body in an effort  to solve the riddle of \"creation\" and pierce the mystery of the  \"hereafter.\"    The _practical point of view_ is that of the modern practical scientist,  who deals only with actual facts of human experience and seeks only  immediate practical results.    The speculative problem is the historical and religious one of the  mortality or immortality of the soul. The practical problem is the  scientific one that demands to know what the mental forces are and how  they can be used most effectively.    [Sidenote: What We Want to Know]    There is no especial need here to trace the historical development of  these two problems or enter upon a discussion of religious or  philosophical questions.    Our immediate interest in the mind and its relationship to the body is  not because we want to be assured of the salvation of our souls after  death.    _We want to know all we can about the reality and certainty and  character of mental control of bodily functions because of the practical  use we can make of such knowledge in this life, here and now._    [Sidenote: Spiritualist, Materialist and Scientist]    The practical scientist has nothing in common with either spiritualists,  soul-believers, on the one hand, or materialists on the other. So far as  the mortality of the soul is concerned, he may be either a spiritualist  or a materialist But spiritualism or materialism is to him only an  intellectual pastime. It is not his trade. In his actual work he seeks  only practical results, and so confines himself wholly to the actual  facts of human experience.    The practical scientist knows that as between two given facts, and  _only_ as between these two, one may be the \"cause\" of the other. But he  is not interested in the \"creative origin\" of material things. He does  not attempt to discover \"first\" causes.    [Sidenote: Science of Cause and Effect]    The practical scientist ascribes all sorts of qualities to electricity  and lays down many laws concerning it without having the remotest idea  as to what, in the last analysis, electricity may actually be. He is not  concerned with ultimate truths. He does his work, and necessarily so,  upon the principle that for all practical purposes he is justified in  using any given assumption as a working hypothesis if everything happens  just as if it were true.    The practical scientist applies the term \"cause\" to any object or event  that is the invariable predecessor of some other object or event.    For him a \"cause\" is simply any object or event that may be looked upon  as forecasting the action of some other object or the occurrence of some  other event.    The point with him is simply this, Does or does not this object or this  event in any way affect that object or that event or determine its  behavior?    [Sidenote: Causes and \"First\" Causes]    No matter where you look you will find that every fact in Nature is  relatively cause and effect according to the point of view. Thus, if a  railroad engine backs into a train of cars it transmits a certain amount  of motion to the first car. This imparted motion is again passed on to  the next car, and so on. The motion of the first car is, on the one  hand, the effect of the impact of the engine, and is, on the other hand,  the \"cause\" of the motion of the second car. And, in general, what is an  \"effect\" in the first car becomes a \"cause\" when looked at in relation  to the second, and what is an \"effect\" in the second becomes a \"cause\"  in relation to the third. So that even the materialist will agree that  \"cause\" and \"effect\" are relative terms in dealing with any series of  facts in Nature.    [Sidenote: A Common Platform for All]    A man may be either a spiritualist, believing that the mind is a  manifestation of the super-soul, or he may be a materialist, and in  either case he may at the same time and with perfect consistency  believe, as a practical scientist, that the mind is a \"cause\" and has  bodily action as its \"effect.\"    Naturally this point of view offers no difficulties whatever to the  spiritualist. He already looks upon the mind or soul as the \"originating  cause\" of everything.    [Sidenote: Thoughts Treated as Causes]    But the materialist, too, may in accordance with his speculative theory  continue to insist that _brain-action_ is the \"originating cause\" of  mental life; yet if the facts show that certain"]]]
