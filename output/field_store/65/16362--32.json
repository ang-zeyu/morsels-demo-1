These are offered by the friends of both parties; besides  which the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the  bride, whose property she is looked upon before marriage; but after it  she is esteemed the sole property of her husband. The ceremony being  now ended the festival begins, which is celebrated with bonefires, and  loud acclamations of joy, accompanied with music and dancing.    We are almost a nation of dancers, musicians, and poets. Thus every  great event, such as a triumphant return from battle, or other cause  of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances, which are  accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion. The assembly  is separated into four divisions, which dance either apart or in  succession, and each with a character peculiar to itself. The first  division contains the married men, who in their dances frequently  exhibit feats of arms, and the representation of a battle. To these  succeed the married women, who dance in the second division. The young  men occupy the third; and the maidens the fourth. Each represents some  interesting scene of real life, such as a great achievement, domestic  employment, a pathetic story, or some rural sport; and as the subject  is generally founded on some recent event, it is therefore ever new.  This gives our dances a spirit and variety which I have scarcely seen  elsewhere[B]. We have many musical instruments, particularly drums of  different kinds, a piece of music which resembles a guitar, and  another much like a stickado. These last are chiefly used by betrothed  virgins, who play on them on all grand festivals.    As our manners are simple, our luxuries are few. The dress of both  sexes is nearly the same. It generally consists of a long piece of  callico, or muslin, wrapped loosely round the body, somewhat in the  form of a highland plaid. This is usually dyed blue, which is our  favourite colour. It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and  richer than any I have seen in Europe. Besides this, our women of  distinction wear golden ornaments; which they dispose with some  profusion on their arms and legs. When our women are not employed with  the men in tillage, their usual occupation is spinning and weaving  cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make it into garments. They  also manufacture earthen vessels, of which we have many kinds. Among  the rest tobacco pipes, made after the same fashion, and used in the  same manner, as those in Turkey[C].    Our manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are  unacquainted with those refinements in cookery which debauch the  taste: bullocks, goats, and poultry, supply the greatest part of their  food. These constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country,  and the chief articles of its commerce. The flesh is usually stewed in  a pan; to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper, and other  spices, and we have salt made of wood ashes. Our vegetables are mostly  plantains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family  usually eats alone; his wives and slaves have also their separate  tables. Before we taste food we always wash our hands: indeed our  cleanliness on all occasions is extreme; but on this it is an  indispensable ceremony. After washing, libation is made, by pouring  out a small portion of the food, in a certain place, for the spirits  of departed relations, which the natives suppose to preside over their  conduct, and guard them from evil. They are totally unacquainted with  strong or spirituous liquours; and their principal beverage is palm  wine. This is gotten from a tree of that name by tapping it at the  top, and fastening a large gourd to it; and sometimes one tree will  yield three or four gallons in a night. When just drawn it is of a  most delicious sweetness; but in a few days it acquires a tartish and  more spirituous flavour: though I never saw any one intoxicated by it.  The same tree also produces nuts and oil. Our principal luxury is in  perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious  fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown  into the fire diffuses a most powerful odour[D]. We beat this wood  into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women  perfume themselves.    In our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament. Each  master of a family has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with  a moat or fence, or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered;  which, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his houses to  accommodate his family and slaves; which, if numerous, frequently  present the appearance of a village. In the middle stands the  principal building, appropriated to the sole use of the master, and  consisting of two apartments; in one of which he sits in the day with  his family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends.  He has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps, together  with his male children. On each side are the apartments of his wives,  who have also their separate day and night houses. The habitations of  the slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of  the enclosure. These houses never exceed one story in height: they are  always built of wood, or stakes driven into the ground, crossed with  wattles, and neatly plastered within, and without. The roof is  thatched with reeds. Our day-houses are left open at the sides; but  those in which we sleep are always covered, and plastered in the  inside, with a composition mixed with cow-dung, to keep off the  different insects, which annoy us during the night. The walls and  floors also of these are generally covered with mats. Our beds consist  of a platform, raised three or four feet from the ground, on which are  laid skins, and different parts of a spungy tree called plaintain. Our  covering is calico or muslin, the same as our dress. The usual seats  are a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally  perfumed, to accommodate strangers: these compose the greater part of  our household furniture. Houses so constructed and furnished require  but little skill to erect them. Every man is a sufficient architect  for the purpose. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous  assistance in building them and in return receive, and expect no other  recompense than a feast.    As we live in a country where nature is prodigal of her favours, our  wants are few and easily supplied; of course we have few manufactures.  They consist for the most part of calicoes, earthern ware, ornaments,  and instruments of war and husbandry. But these make no part of our  commerce, the principal articles of which, as I have observed, are  provisions. In such a state money is of little use; however we have  some small pieces of coin, if I may call them such. They are made  something like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or  denomination. We have also markets, at which I have been frequently  with my mother. These are sometimes visited by stout mahogany-coloured  men from the south west of us: we call them Oye-Eboe, which term  signifies red men living at a distance. They generally bring us  fire-arms, gunpowder, hats, beads, and dried fish. The last we  esteemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and springs.  These articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth,  and our salt of wood ashes. They always carry slaves through our land;  but the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them  before they are suffered to pass. Sometimes indeed we sold slaves to  them, but they were only prisoners of war, or such among us as had  been convicted of kidnapping, or adultery, and some other crimes,  which we esteemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to  think, that, notwithstanding all our strictness, their principal  business among us was to trepan our people. I remember too they  carried great sacks along with them, which not long after I had an  opportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose.    Our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of  vegetables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and vast  quantities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine apples grow without  culture; they are about the size of the largest sugar-loaf, and finely  flavoured. We have also spices of different kinds, particularly  pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never seen in  Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance.  All our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature.  Agriculture is our chief employment; and every one, even the children  and women, are engaged in it. Thus we are all habituated to labour  from our earliest years. Every one contributes something to the common  stock; and as we are unacquainted with idleness, we have no beggars.  The benefits of such a mode of living are obvious. The West India  planters prefer the slaves of Benin or Eboe to those of any other part  of Guinea, for their hardiness, intelligence, integrity, and zeal.  Those benefits are felt by us in the general healthiness of the  people, and in their vigour and activity; I might have added too in  their comeliness. Deformity is indeed unknown amongst us, I mean that  of shape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London might be  brought in support of this assertion: for, in regard to complexion,  ideas of beauty are wholly relative. I remember while in Africa to  have seen three negro children, who were tawny, and another quite  white, who were universally regarded by myself, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15435"],[0,"Object Lessons on the Human Body (#3)"],[1,"older, so that  when fully grown it has but three pieces in this bone.    [1] The teeth are not bone, but a kind of soft, bone-like substance, called  _dentine_. Common ivory is dentine.           *       *       *       *       *    PART IV.    FORMULAS FOR THE LESSONS ON THE ORGANS OF SENSE.    1. _The Eyes._--My eyes are to see with.    My eye is like a ball in a deep, bony socket. The black circle in the  centre is the pupil or window of my eye; the colored ring is the iris or  curtain; the white part is the eyeball.    My upper and lower eyelids cover and protect my eyes.    My eyebrows are for beauty, and keep the perspiration from rolling into my  eyes.    My eyes are washed by teardrops every time I wink my eyelids.    2. _The Ears._--My ears are to hear with:      the rim of my ear,    the flap of my ear,    the drum of my ear.    The drum of my ear is protected by a fence of short, stiff hairs, and by a  bitter wax about the roots of these hairs.    3. _The Nose._--My nose is to smell and breathe with; it is in the middle  of my face:      my two nostrils,    the bridge of my nose,    the cartilage,    the tip of my nose.    My nostrils lead to a passage back of my mouth through which I breathe.    The cartilage separates my nose into two parts.    4. _The Mouth._--My mouth is to speak, eat, and breathe through:      my upper lip,    my lower lip.    In my mouth are:      my tongue,    my lower teeth,    my upper teeth,    my lower teeth,    and my upper and lower jaws, covered with flesh called _gum_.    5. _The Teeth._--My teeth are used in eating and talking.    My teeth are made of a soft kind of bone, covered with enamel.    I have three kinds of teeth: cutting teeth, tearing teeth, grinding teeth.    A young child has twenty teeth, ten in each jaw.    A grown person has thirty-two teeth, sixteen in each jaw.    6. To preserve my teeth:      I must keep them clean.    I must not scratch the enamel.    I must not eat or drink anything very hot or very cold.    I must not use them for scissors or nut-crackers.    I must not burn them with tobacco or cigars.    7. _About Eating._--When I eat I move my lower jaw only.      My tongue brings the food between my teeth,    the cutters cut it,    the tearers tear it,    the grinders grind it,    the saliva moistens it,    and my tongue helps me to swallow it.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULAS.    1.

FORMULA FOR DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES.    1. My skull is formed of several bones united, like two saws with their  toothed edges hooked into each other.    2. My spine extends from the base of the skull behind, down the middle of  my back.    It is composed of twenty-four short bones, piled one upon the other, with  cartilage between them.    These bones are fastened together, forming an upright and flexible column,  which makes me erect and graceful.    3. My ribs are curved, strong, and light; there are twenty-four of them,  twelve on each side; they are fastened at the back to my spine, in front to  my breastbone, forming a hollow place for my heart, lungs, and stomach.    4. My shoulder blades are flat, thin, and like a triangle in shape; they  are for my arms to rest upon.    5. My collar bones are fastened to my shoulder blades and my breastbone;  they keep my arms from sliding too far forward.    6. The bones of old people are hard and brittle; those of children soft and  flexible; so I must sit and stand erect, that mine may not be bent out of  shape. I must not wear tight clothing, or do anything that will crowd them  out of their places.    7. My bones are made from my food, after it has been changed into blood; so  I must be careful to eat good, wholesome food, that they may be strong and  healthy.    8. I must not breathe impure air, because impure air makes bad blood, and  bad blood makes poor bones.    9. The body of every person is changing all the time, because the skin,  flesh, and"]]]
