A case of acute bone spavin in a horse of little value is not generally  treated in a manner that will incur an expense equivalent to one-half  the value of the subject. The fact is always to be considered in such  cases, that even where ideal conditions favor proper treatment, the  outcome is uncertain. Where less than six weeks of rest can be allowed  the animal, one affected with bone spavin would therefore not be treated  with the expectation of obtaining good results, as six weeks' time, at  least, is necessary for a successful outcome. If the cost attending the  enforced idleness of an animal of this kind is considered prohibitive  for the employment of proper measures to affect a cure, and if lameness  is slight, the animal should be given suitable work, but in cases of  articular spavin in aged subjects, they should be humanely destroyed and  not subjected to prolonged misery.    A thorough knowledge of the structure and functions of the affected  parts is necessary to proceed in cases of lameness; likewise, the age,  conformation and temperament of the subject need to be taken into  consideration; the presence or absence of complications demand the  attention; the kind of care the subject will probably receive directly  influences the outcome; and the character of service expected of the  subject, too, needs to be carefully considered before the ultimate  outcome may reasonably be foretold.    The practitioner is often confronted with the problem of how best to  handle certain cases. Will they do better under conditions where  absolute quiet is enforced, or is it preferable to allow exercise at  will? The temperament of the animal must be considered in such cases,  and if a lame horse is too active and playful when given his freedom,  exercise must be restricted or prevented, as the case may require. In  cases of strains of tendons, during the acute stage, immobilization of  the affected parts is in order. In certain sub-acute inflammatory  processes or in instances of paralytic disturbance where convalescence  is in progress, moderate exercise is highly beneficial.    Consequently, each case in itself presents an individual problem to be  judged and handled in the manner experience has taught to be most  effective, appropriate and practical, and the veterinarian should give  due consideration to the comfort and welfare of the crippled animal as  well as to the interests of the owner.          SECTION I.    ETIOLOGY AND OCCURRENCE.      In discussions of pathological conditions contributing to lameness in  the horse, cause is generally classified under two heads--_predisposing_  and _exciting_. It becomes necessary, however, to adopt a more general  and comprehensive method of classification, herein, which will enable  the reader to obtain a better conception of the subject and to more  clearly associate the parts so grouped descriptively.    Though _predisposing_ factors, such as faulty conformation, are often to  be reckoned with, _exciting_ causes predominate more frequently in any  given number of cases. The noble tendency of the horse to serve its  master under the stress of pain, even to the point of complete  exhaustion and sudden death, should win for these willing servants a  deeper consideration of their welfare. Too frequently are their  manifestations of discomfort allowed to pass unheeded by careless,  incompetent drivers lacking in a sense of compassion. Symptoms of  malaise should never be ignored in any case; the humane and economic  features should be realized by any owner of animals.    In the consideration of group causes, lameness may be said to originate  from affections of bones, ligaments, thecae and bursae, muscles and  tendons, nerves, lymph vessels and glands, and blood vessels, and may  also result from an involvement of one or several of the aforementioned  tissues, caused by rheumatism. Further, affections of the feet merit  separate consideration, and, finally, a miscellaneous grouping of  various dissimilar ailments, which for the most part, do not directly  involve the locomotory apparatus but do, by their nature, impede normal  movement.      AFFECTIONS OF BONES.    The bony column serving as the framework and support of the legs,  probably constitutes the most vital element having to do with weight  bearing and locomotion, and therefore during the acute and painful stage  of bone affections, the pain becomes more intense in the process and  pressure of standing than when the member is swung or advanced.    Certain bones are so well protected by muscular structures that they are  not frequently injured except as a result of violence which may produce  fracture. However, there are certain bones which receive the constant  shock of concussion when the animal is subjected to daily, rapid work on  hard road surfaces. Splints, ringbones and spavins are the most general  examples produced by these conditions.    Varying pathological developments often result from concussion,  contusion or other violent shocks to the bony structures. In such cases  there either follows a simple periostitis which may resolve  spontaneously with no obvious outward symptom, or osteitis, which may  occur with tissue changes, as in exostosis; or the case may produce any  degree of reaction between these two possible extremes.      Rarefying Osteitis, or Degenerative Changes.    Certain bone affections, such as osteomalacia or osteoporosis, are in  the main, responsible for distortions and morphological changes of bone,  causing lameness, permanent blemish and even resulting in death of the  affected animal. The climatic conditions in some localities favor these  occurrences but they may also be ascribed to improper food constituents  and to possible infective agencies.    Rarefying degenerative changes manifested by exostosis involving the  phalanges of the young, causing ringbone, are fairly common in  occurrence throughout this country. This is due, supposedly, to a lack  of mineral substance in the bony structure of the affected animals, and  is known as rachitis--commonly called rickets. Since the affected  subjects suffer involvement of several of the extremities at the same  time, the theory of rachitic origin seems well supported.      Fractures.    Fractures of bones constitute serious conditions and are always  manifested by lameness. A sub-classification is essential here for the  student of veterinary medicine who would comprehend the technic of  reduction and subsequent treatment in such cases.    Fractures are classified by many authorities as being _simple_,  _compound_, and _comminuted_. This method is practical because it  separates dissimilar conditions. There are also grouped fractures, the  pathologic anatomy of which is similar. Classification on an etiological  basis would attempt to associate conditions, the morbid anatomy and  gravity of which would justly preclude their being combined.    Simple Fracture is a condition where the continuity of the bone has  been broken without serious destruction of the soft structures adjacent,  and where no opening has been made to the surface of the flesh. Such  fractures do not reduce the bone to fragments. Long bones are frequently  subjected to simple fracture, while short thick bones, such as the  second phalanx, may suffer multiple or comminuted fractures.    Compound Fracture designates a break of bone with the destruction of  the soft tissues covering it, making an open wound to the surface of the  skin. This form of fracture is serious because of the attendant danger  of infection, and in treatment, necessitates special precaution being  taken in the application of splints that the wound may be cared for  without infection of the tissues. These fractures generally occur as a  result of some forceful impact through the flesh to the bone, or where  the bones are driven outward by the blow. Common examples are in  fractures of the metacarpus and metatarsus of the first phalanx. This  kind of injury in mature horses usually produces an irreparable  condition, and viewed economically, is generally considered fatal.    Comminuted Fractures, as the term implies, are those cases wherein the  bone is reduced to a number of small pieces. This kind of break may be  classified as simple-comminuted fracture when the skin is unbroken, and  when the bone is exposed as a result of the injury, it is known as a  compound-comminuted fracture. Such fractures are caused by violent  contusion or where the member is caught between two objects and  crushed.      Multiple Fractures.    Fractures are called _multiple_ when the bone is reduced to a number of  pieces of large size. This condition differs from a comminuted fracture  in that the multiple fracture may break the bone into several pieces  without the pieces being ground or crushed, and the affected bone may  still retain its normal shape.    Further classification is of value in describing fractures of bone with  respect to the manner in which the bone is broken--the direction of the  fissure or fissures in relation to its long axis.    A fracture is _transverse_ when the bone is broken at a right angle from  its long axis. Such breaks when simple, are the least trouble to care  for because there is little likelihood that the broken ends of bone will  become so displaced that they will not remain in apposition. _Simple  transverse_ fracture of the metacarpus, for instance, constitutes a  favorable case for treatment if other conditions are favorable.    _Oblique fractures_, as may be surmised, are solutions of continuity of  bone in such manner that the fissure crosses the long axis of a bone at  an acute or obtuse angle. These fractures are prone to injure the soft  structures adjacent, and are frequently compound, as well. Moreover,  because of the fact that the apposing pieces of bone are beveled, the  broken ends"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#3)"],[1,"there appeared      to Zachary an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the      altar of incense. That the nations attached a meaning not only of      personal reverence, but also of religious homage, to an offering      of incense, is demonstrable from the instance of the Magi, who,      having fallen down to adore the new-born Jesus, and recognized his      Divinity, presented Him with gold, myrrh and frankincense. The      primitive Christians imitated the example of the Jews, and adopted      the use of incense at the celebration of the Liturgy. St. Ephraem,      a father of the Syriac Church, directed in his will that no      aromatic perfumes should be bestowed upon him at his funeral, but      that the spices should rather be given to the sanctuary. The use      of incense in all the Oriental churches is perpetual, and almost      daily; nor do any of them ever celebrate their Liturgy without it,      unless compelled by necessity. The Coptic, as well as other      Eastern Christians, observe the same ceremonial as the Latin      Church in incensing their altar, the sacred vessels, and      ecclesiastical personages.\"--DR. ROCK'S _Hierurgia_.    Perfumes were used in the Church service, not only under the form of  incense, but also mixed in the oil and wax for the lamps and lights  commanded to be burned in the house of the Lord. The brilliancy and  fragrance which were often shed around a martyr's sepulchre, at the  celebration of his festival, by multitudes of lamps and tapers, fed with  aromatics, have been noticed by St. Paulinus:--        \"With crowded lamps are these bright altars crowned,      And waxen tapers, shedding perfume round      From fragrant wicks, beam calm a scented ray,      To gladden night, and joy e'en radiant day.\"        DR. ROCK'S _Hierurgia_.    Constantine the Great provided fragrant oils, to be burned at the altars  of the greater churches in Rome; and St. Paulinus, of Nola, a writer of  the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century, tells us how,  in his times, wax tapers were made for church use, so as to shed  fragrance as they burned:--        \"Lumina cerates adolentur odora papyris.\"    A perfume in common use, even to this day, was the invention of one of  the earliest of the Roman nobles, named Frangipani, and still bears his  name; it is a powder, or sachet, composed of every known spice, in equal  proportions, to which is added ground iris or orris root, in weight  equal to the whole, with one per cent. of musk or civet. A liquid of the  same name, invented by his grandson Mercutio Frangipani, is also in  common use, prepared by digesting the Frangipane powder in rectified  spirits, which dissolves out the fragrant principles. This has the merit  of being the most lasting perfume made.        \"The trade for the East in perfume-drugs caused many a vessel to      spread its sails to the Red Sea, and many a camel to plod over      that tract which gave to Greece and Syria their importance as      markets, and vitality to the rocky city of Petra. Southern Italy      was not long ere it occupied itself in ministering to the luxury      of the wealthy, by manufacturing scented unguents and perfumes. So      numerous were the UNGUENTARII, or perfumers, that they      are said to have filled the great street of ancient      Capua.\"--HOFMANN.    As an art, in England, perfumery has attained little or no distinction.  This has arisen from those who follow it as a trade, maintaining a  mysterious secrecy about their processes. No manufacture can ever become  great or important to the community that is carried on under a veil of  mystery.        \"On the subject of trade mystery I will only observe, that I am      convinced that it would be far more to the interest of      manufacturers if they were more willing to profit by the      experience of others, and less fearful and jealous of the supposed      secrets of their craft. It is a great mistake to think that a      successful manufacturer is one who has carefully preserved the      secrets of his trade, or that peculiar modes of effecting simple      things, processes unknown in other factories, and mysteries beyond      the comprehension of the vulgar, are in any way essential to skill      as a manufacturer, or to success as a trader.\"--PROFESSOR      SOLLY.    If the horticulturists of England were instructed how to collect the  odors of flowers, a new branch of manufacture would spring up to vie  with our neighbors' skill in it across the Channel.    Of our five senses, that of SMELLING has been treated with  comparative indifference. However, as knowledge progresses, the various  faculties with which the Creator has thought proper in his wisdom to  endow man will become developed, and the faculty of Smelling will meet  with its share of tuition as well as Sight, Hearing, Touch, and Taste.    Flowers yield perfumes in all climates, but those growing in the warmer  latitudes are most prolific in their odor, while those from the colder  are the sweetest. Hooker, in his travels in Iceland, speaks of the  delightful fragrance of the flowers in the valley of Skardsheidi; we  know that winter-green, violets, and primroses are found here, and the  wild thyme, in great abundance. Mr. Louis Piesse, in company with  Captain Sturt, exploring the wild regions of South Australia, writes:  \"The rains have clothed the earth with a green as beautiful as a  Shropshire meadow in May, and with flowers, too, as sweet as an English  violet; the pure white anemone resembles it in scent. The Yellow Wattle,  when in flower, is splendid, and emits a most fragrant odor.\"    Though many of the finest perfumes come from the East Indies, Ceylon,  Mexico, and Peru, the South of Europe is the only real garden of utility  to the perfumer. Grasse and Nice are the principal seats of the art;  from their geographical position, the grower, within comparatively short  distances, has at command that change of climate best fitted to bring to  perfection the plants required for his trade. On the seacoast his Cassiae  grows without fear of frost, one night of which would destroy all the  plants for a season; while, nearer the Alps, his violets are found  sweeter than if grown in the warmer situations, where the orange tree  and mignionette bloom to perfection. England can claim the superiority  in the growth of lavender and peppermint; the essential oils extracted  from these plants grown at Mitcham, in Surrey, realize eight times the  price in the market of those produced in France or elsewhere, and are  fully worth the difference for delicacy of odor.    The odors of plants reside in different parts of them, sometimes in the  roots, as in the iris and vitivert; the stem or wood, in cedar and  sandal; the leaves, in mint, patchouly, and thyme; the flower, in the  roses and violets; the seeds in the Tonquin bean and caraway; the bark,  in cinnamon, &c.    Some plants yield more than one odor, which are quite distinct and  characteristic. The orange tree, for instance, gives three--from the  leaves one called _petit grain_; from the flowers we procure _neroli_;  and from the rind of the fruit, essential oil of orange, _essence of  Portugal_. On this account, perhaps, this tree is the most valuable of  all to the operative perfumer.    The fragrance or odor of plants is owing, in nearly all cases, to a  perfectly volatile oil, either contained in small vessels, or sacs  within them, or generated from time to time, during their life, as when  in blossom. Some few exude, by incision, odoriferous gums, as benzoin,  olibanum, myrrh, &c.; others give, by the same act, what are called  balsams, which appear to be mixtures of an odorous oil and an inodorous  gum. Some of these balsams are procured in the country to which the  plant is indigenous by boiling it in water for a time, straining, and  then boiling again, or evaporating it down till it assumes the  consistency of treacle. In this latter way is balsam of Peru procured  from the _Myroxylon peruiferum_, and the balsam of Tolu from the  _Myroxylon toluiferum_. Though their odors are agreeable, they are not  much applied in perfumery for handkerchief use, but by some they are  mixed with soap, and in England they are valued more for their medicinal  properties than for their fragrance.          SECTION II.        \"Were not summer's distillations left        A liquid prisoner, pent in walls of glass,      Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,        Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was;      But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,      Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.\"        SHAKSPEARE.      The extensive flower farms in the neighborhood of Nice, Grasse,  Montpellier, and Cannes, in France, at Adrianople (Turkey in Asia), at  Broussa and Uslak (Turkey in Asia), and at Mitcham, in England, in a  measure indicate the commercial importance of that branch of chemistry  called perfumery.    British India and Europe consume annually, at the very lowest estimate,  150,000 gallons of perfumed spirits, under various titles, such as eau  de Cologne, essence of lavender, esprit de rose, &c. The art of  perfumery does not, however, confine itself to the production of scents  for the handkerchief and bath, but extends to imparting odor to  inodorous bodies, such as soap, oil, starch, and grease, which are  consumed at the toilette of fashion. Some idea of the commercial  importance of this art may be formed, when we state that one of the  large perfumers of Grasse and Paris employs annually 80,000 lbs. of  orange flowers, 60,000 lbs. of cassia flowers, 54,000 lbs. of  rose-leaves, 32,000 lbs. of jasmine blossoms, 32,000 lbs. of violets,  20,000 lbs. of tubereuse, 16,000 lbs. of lilac, besides rosemary, mint,  lemon, citron, thyme, and other odorous plants in large proportion. In  fact, the quantity of odoriferous substances used in this way is far  beyond"]]]
