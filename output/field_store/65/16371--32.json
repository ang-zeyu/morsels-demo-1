Yet I did not. He affected me strangely, or perhaps it was my emotion at  the thought that we Rangers, with so much in common and at stake, had  come together.    \"Is Sampson at home?\" he asked abruptly.    I said, \"Yes.\"    \"Ask him if he'll see Vaughn Steele, Ranger.\"    \"Wait here,\" I replied. I did not want to take up any time then  explaining my presence there.    Deliberately and noisily I strode down the porch and entered the room  with the smoking men.    I went in farther than was necessary for me to state my errand. But I  wanted to see Sampson's face, to see into his eyes.    As I entered, the talking ceased. I saw no face except his and that  seemed blank.    \"Vaughn Steele, Ranger--come to see you, sir.\" I announced.    Did Sampson start--did his eyes show a fleeting glint--did his face  almost imperceptibly blanch? I could not have sworn to either. But there  was a change, maybe from surprise.    The first sure effect of my announcement came in a quick exclamation  from Wright, a sibilant intake of breath, that did not seem to denote  surprise so much as certainty. Wright might have emitted a curse with  less force.    Sampson moved his hand significantly and the action was a voiceless  command for silence as well as an assertion that he would attend to this  matter. I read him clearly so far. He had authority, and again I felt  his power.    \"Steele to see me. Did he state his business?\"    \"No, sir.\" I replied.    \"Russ, say I'm not at home,\" said Sampson presently, bending over to  relight his pipe.    I went out. Someone slammed the door behind me.    As I strode back across the porch my mind worked swiftly; the machinery  had been idle for a while and was now started.    \"Mr. Steele,\" I said, \"Colonel Sampson says he's not at home. Tell your  business to his daughter.\"    Without waiting to see the effect of my taking so much upon myself, I  knocked upon the parlor door. Miss Sampson opened it. She wore white.  Looking at her, I thought it would be strange if Steele's well-known  indifference to women did not suffer an eclipse.    \"Miss Sampson, here is Vaughn Steele to see you,\" I said.    \"Won't you come in?\" she said graciously.    Steele had to bend his head to enter the door. I went in with him, an  intrusion, perhaps, that in the interest of the moment she appeared not  to notice.    Steele seemed to fill the room with his giant form. His face was fine,  stern, clear cut, with blue or gray eyes, strangely penetrating. He was  coatless, vestless. He wore a gray flannel shirt, corduroys, a big gun  swinging low, and top boots reaching to his knees.    He was the most stalwart son of Texas I had seen in many a day, but  neither his great stature nor his striking face accounted for something  I felt--a something spiritual, vital, compelling, that drew me.    \"Mr. Steele, I'm pleased to meet you,\" said Miss Sampson. \"This is my  cousin, Sally Langdon. We just arrived--I to make this my home, she to  visit me.\"    Steele smiled as he bowed to Sally. He was easy, with a kind of rude  grace, and showed no sign of embarrassment or that beautiful girls were  unusual to him.    \"Mr. Steele, we've heard of you in Austin,\" said Sally with her eyes  misbehaving.    I hoped I would not have to be jealous of Steele. But this girl was a  little minx if not altogether a flirt.    \"I did not expect to be received by ladies,\" replied Steele. \"I called  upon Mr. Sampson. He would not see me. I was to tell my business to his  daughter. I'm glad to know you, Miss Sampson and your cousin, but sorry  you've come to Linrock now.\"    \"Why?\" queried both girls in unison.    \"Because it's--oh, pretty rough--no place for girls to walk and ride.\"    \"Ah! I see. And your business has to do with rough places,\" said Miss  Sampson. \"Strange that papa would not see you. Stranger that he should  want me to hear your business. Either he's joking or wants to impress  me.    \"Papa tried to persuade me not to come. He tried to frighten me with  tales of this--this roughness out here. He knows I'm in earnest, how I'd  like to help somehow, do some little good. Pray tell me this business.\"    \"I wished to get your father's cooperation in my work.\"    \"Your work? You mean your Ranger duty--the arresting of rough  characters?\"    \"That, yes. But that's only a detail. Linrock is bad internally. My job  is to make it good.\"    \"A splendid and worthy task,\" replied Miss Sampson warmly. \"I wish you  success. But, Mr. Steele, aren't you exaggerating Linrock's wickedness?\"    \"No,\" he answered forcibly.    \"Indeed! And papa refused to see you--presumably refused to cooperate  with you?\" she asked thoughtfully.    \"I take it that way.\"    \"Mr. Steele, pray tell me what is the matter with Linrock and just  what the work is you're called upon to do?\" she asked seriously. \"I  heard papa say that he was the law in Linrock. Perhaps he resents  interference. I know he'll not tolerate any opposition to his will.  Please tell me. I may be able to influence him.\"    I listened to Steele's deep voice as he talked about Linrock. What he  said was old to me, and I gave heed only to its effect.    Miss Sampson's expression, which at first had been earnest and grave,  turned into one of incredulous amaze. She, and Sally too, watched  Steele's face in fascinated attention.    When it came to telling what he wanted to do, the Ranger warmed to his  subject; he talked beautifully, convincingly, with a certain strange,  persuasive power that betrayed how he worked his way; and his fine face,  losing its stern, hard lines, seemed to glow and give forth a spirit  austere, yet noble, almost gentle, assuredly something vastly different  from what might have been expected in the expression of a gun-fighting  Ranger. I sensed that Miss Sampson felt this just as I did.    \"Papa said you were a hounder of outlaws--a man who'd rather kill than  save!\" she exclaimed.    The old stern cast returned to Steele's face. It was as if he had  suddenly remembered himself.    \"My name is infamous, I am sorry to say,\" he replied.    \"You have killed men?\" she asked, her dark eyes dilating.    Had any one ever dared ask Steele that before? His face became a mask.  It told truth to me, but she could not see, and he did not answer.    \"Oh, you are above that. Don't--don't kill any one here!\"    \"Miss Sampson, I hope I won't.\" His voice seemed to check her. I had  been right in my estimate of her character--young, untried, but all  pride, fire, passion. She was white then, and certainly beautiful.    Steele watched her, could scarcely have failed to see the white gleam of  her beauty, and all that evidence of a quick and noble heart.    \"Pardon me, please, Mr. Steele,\" she said, recovering her composure. \"I  am--just a little overexcited. I didn't mean to be inquisitive. Thank  you for your confidence. I've enjoyed your call, though your news did  distress me. You may rely upon me to talk to papa.\"    That appeared to be a dismissal, and, bowing to her and Sally, the  Ranger went out. I followed, not having spoken.    At the end of the porch I caught up with Steele and walked out into the  moonlight beside him.    Just why I did not now reveal my identity I could not say, for certainly  I was bursting with the desire to surprise him, to earn his approval. He  loomed dark above me, appearing not to be aware of my presence. What a  cold, strange proposition this Ranger was!    Still, remembering the earnestness of his talk to Miss Sampson, I could  not think him cold. But I must have thought him so to any attraction of  those charming girls.    Suddenly, as we passed under the shade of cottonwoods, he clamped a big  hand down on my shoulder.    \"My God, Russ, isn't she lovely!\" he ejaculated.    In spite of my being dumbfounded I had to hug him. He knew me!    \"Thought you didn't swear!\" I gasped.    Ridiculously those were my first words to Vaughn Steele.    \"My boy, I saw you parading up and down the street looking for me,\" he  said. \"I intended to help you find me to-morrow.\"    We gripped hands, and that strong feel and clasp meant much.    \"Yes, she's lovely, Steele,\" I said. \"But did you look at the cousin,  the little girl with the eyes?\"    Then we laughed and loosed hands.    \"Come on, let's get out somewhere. I've a million things to tell you.\"    We went away out into the open where some stones gleamed white in the  moonlight, and there, sitting in the sand, our backs against a rest, and  with all quiet about us, we settled down for a long conference.    I began with Neal's urgent message to me, then told of my going to the  capitol--what I had overheard when Governor Smith was in the adjutant's  office; of my interview with them; of the spying on Colonel Sampson;  Neal's directions, advice, and command; the ride toward San Antonio; my  being engaged as cowboy by Miss Sampson; of the further ride on to  Sanderson and the incident there; and finally how I had approached  Sampson and then had thought it well to get his daughter into the scheme  of things.    It was a long talk, even for me, and my voice sounded husky.    \"I told Neal I'd be lucky to get you,\" said Steele, after a silence.    That was the only comment on my actions, the only praise, but the quiet  way he spoke it made me feel like a boy undeserving of so much.    \"Here, I forgot the money Neal sent,\" I went on, glad to be rid of the  huge roll of bills.    The Ranger showed surprise. Besides, he was very glad.    \"The Captain loves the service,\" said Steele. \"He alone knows the worth  of the Rangers. And the work he's given his life to--the _good_ that  _service_ really does--all depends on you and me, Russ!\"    I assented, gloomily enough. Then I waited while he pondered.    The moon soared clear; there was a cool wind rustling the greasewood; a  dog bayed a barking coyote; lights twinkled down in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#3)"],[1,"West End. The river, too, all along the Garden Reach  and far below is often almost as crowded as the Pool of London, with  ocean-going steamers waiting to load or unload their cargoes as well as  with lumbering native sailing ships and the ferries that ply ceaselessly  between the different quarters of the city on both banks of the Hugli.  The continuous roar of traffic in the busy streets, the crowded  tram-cars, the motors and taxis jostling the ancient bullock-carts, the  surging crowds in the semi-Europeanised native quarters, even the pall  of smoke that tells of many modern industrial activities are not quite  so characteristic of new India as, when I was last there, the  sandwich-men with boards inviting a vote for this or that candidate in  the elections to the new Indian Councils.    In all the strenuous life and immense wealth of this great city, to  which European enterprise first gave and still gives the chief impulse,  Indians are taking an increasing share. The Bengalees themselves still  hold very much aloof from modern developments of trade and industry, but  they were the first to appreciate the value of Western education, and  the Calcutta University with all its shortcomings has maintained the  high position which Lord Dalhousie foreshadowed for it nearly seventy  years ago. In art and literature the modern Bengalee has often known how  to borrow from the West without sacrificing either his own originality  or the traditions of his race or the spirit of his creed. Some of the  finest Bengalee brains have taken for choice to the legal profession and  have abundantly justified themselves both as judges in the highest court  of the province and as barristers and pleaders. In every branch of the  public services open to Indians and in all the liberal professions, as  well as in the civic and political life of their country, the Bengalees  have played a leading part, not restricted even to their own province,  and in the very distinguished person of Lord Sinha, Bengal has just  provided for the first time an Indian to represent the King-Emperor as  governor of a province--the neighbouring province of Behar and Orissa.  Nor have the women of Bengal been left behind as in so many other parts  of India. In Calcutta many highly educated ladies have won such complete  release from the ancient restraints imposed upon their sex that they  preside to-day over refined and cultured homes from which the subtle  atmosphere of the East does not exclude the ease and freedom of Western  habits of mind and body.    Yet these are still exceptions, and even in such a progressive city as  Calcutta and even amongst the highest classes the social and domestic  life of the majority of Hindus is still largely governed by the laws of  Hinduism, and not least with regard to marriage and the seclusion of  women. I was once allowed to attend a sort of \"scripture lesson\" for  little high-caste Hindu girls, organised by a benevolent old Brahman  lady, who has devoted herself to the cause of infant education on  orthodox lines. None of these 40 or 50 little girls had of course  reached the age, usually ten, at which they would be cut off from all  contact with the other sex except in marriage. They had bright and happy  faces, and as it was a Hindu festival most of them were decked out in  all their finery with gold and silver bangles on their dainty arms and  ankles, sometimes with jewelled nose-rings as well as ear-rings. They  went through an elaborate and picturesque ritual with great earnestness  and reverence and carefully followed the injunctions of the Brahman, a  cultured and Western-educated gentleman who presided over the ceremony.  It was an attractive scene, and would have been entirely pleasant but  for the painful contrast afforded by some eight or ten poor little mites  with shaven heads and drab-coloured dresses, almost ragged and quite  unadorned. They were infant widows, condemned according to the laws of  Hinduism by the premature death of their husbands to whom they had been  wedded, but whom they had never known, to lifelong widowhood, and  therefore in most cases to lifelong contempt and drudgery. For they were  debarred henceforth from fulfilling the supreme function of Hindu  womanhood, _i.e._ securing the continuity of family rites from father to  son by bearing children in legitimate wedlock, itself terribly  circumscribed by the narrow limits within which inter-marriage is  permissible even between different septs of the same caste. Happily  those I saw were probably still too young to realise the full  significance of the unkind fate that already differentiated them so  markedly from their more fortunate caste-sisters.    Nor has one to go so very far from the heart of Calcutta to be reminded  that the \"premier city\" of modern India derives its name from Kali, the  most sinister of Indian goddesses. She was the tutelary deity of  Kali-Kata, one of the three villages to which Job Charnock removed the  first British settlement in Bengal when he abandoned Hugli in 1690, and  her shrine has grown in wealth and fame with the growth of Calcutta.  Kali-Kata is to-day only a suburb of the modern city, but in entering it  one passes into another world--the world of popular Hinduism. In its  narrow streets every shop is stocked with the paraphernalia that Hindus  require for their devotions, for everything centres in Kali-Kata round  the popular shrine sacred to Kali, the black goddess of destruction,  with a protruding blood-red tongue, who wears a necklace of human skulls  and a belt of human hands and tongues, and, holding in one of her many  hands a severed human head, tramples under foot the dead bodies of her  victims. From the _ghats_, or long flights of steps, that descend to the  muddy waters of a narrow creek which claims a more or less remote  connection with the sacred Ganges, crowds of pious Hindus go through  their ablutions in accordance with a long and complicated ritual, whilst  high-caste ladies perform them in mid-stream out of covered boats and  behind curtains deftly drawn to protect their _purdah_. Past an ancient  banyan tree, from whose branches streamers of coloured stuffs depend  with other votive offerings from grateful mothers who have not prayed  for male offspring in vain, past the minor shrines of many favourite  deities, a road lined with closely packed beggars and ascetics,  thrusting forth their sores and their shrivelled limbs in the hope of a  few coppers, leads up to the place of sacrifice in front of the temple.  The pavement is still red with the blood of goats immolated to the Great  Goddess, and her devotees who may have just missed the spectacle can at  least embrace the posts to which the victims were tied. On an open  pillared platform facing the holy of holies some of the high-caste  worshippers await in prayer and meditation the moment when its ponderous  bronze doors are from time to time thrown open. One old Brahman lady of  singularly refined appearance presses her fingers alternately on her  right and her left nostril, whilst she expels through the other, keeping  her lips all the time tightly closed, the unhallowed air which may have  contaminated her lungs on her way to the temple. Another worshipper lies  full length with his face pressed to the ground in motionless adoration.  Between them flit about laughing, bright-eyed little girls, the  \"daughters\" of the temple, still unconscious of the life of temple  prostitution to which they have been dedicated from their birth. The  court-yard all around is packed with a surging, howling mob of pilgrims,  many of them from a great distance, fighting for a vantage point from  which they may get a glimpse of the Great Goddess in her inner  sanctuary, even if they cannot hope to penetrate into it.    At last, after much clanging of bells and fierce altercations between  the Brahman priests and the faithful as to payment of necessary fees,  the bronze doors roll back, and in the dim religious twilight one  catches a glint of gold and precious stones, the head-dress of Kali,  whose terrific image barely emerges from the depth of the inner  sanctuary in which it stands, accessible only to its serving Brahmans.  They alone, though strangely enough temple Brahmans as a class enjoy  little credit with their fellow-castemen, can approach the idol and wash  and dress and feed it with offerings. Whilst the doors are open the  frenzy and the noise increases, as the mob of worshippers struggle for a  front place and bawl out their special supplications at the top of their  voices. Then when they are closed again there is a general unravelling  of the tangled knots of perspiring humanity, and those who have achieved  the supreme purpose of their pilgrimage gradually disperse to make room  for another crowd, one stream succeeding another the whole day long on  special festivals, but on ordinary days mostly between sunrise and noon.  At the back of the shrine, as I came away, some privileged worshippers  were waiting to drink a few drops of the foul water which trickles out  of a small conduit through the wall from the holy of holies. It is the  water in which the feet of the idol--and those of the serving  Brahmans--have been washed!    It was in this same temple of Kali that only some fifteen years ago,  during the violent agitation provoked by the Partition of Bengal, vast  crowds used to assemble and take by the name of the Great Goddess the  vow of _Swadeshi_ as the first step to _Swaraj_, and Bengalee youths,  maddened by an inflammatory propaganda, learned to graft on to ancient  forms of worship the very modern cult of the bomb. To this same temple  resorted only the other day Mr. Gandhi's followers to seek the blessing  of the Great Goddess for the more harmless forms of protest by which he  exhorted the inhabitants of Calcutta to bring home to the Duke of  Connaught during his stay in Calcutta their indignant"]]]
