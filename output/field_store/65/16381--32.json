The stomach and intestinal canal have a constant vermicular motion,  which carries forwards their contents, after the lacteals have drank up the  chyle from them; and which is excited into action by the stimulus of the  aliment we swallow, but which becomes occasionally inverted or retrograde,  as in vomiting, and in the iliac passion.    II. 1. The word _sensorium_ in the following pages is designed to express  not only the medullary part of the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs of  sense, and of the muscles; but also at the same time that living principle,  or spirit of animation, which resides throughout the body, without being  cognizable to our senses, except by its effects. The changes which  occasionally take place in the sensorium, as during the exertions of  volition, or the sensations of pleasure or pain, are termed _sensorial  motions_.    2. The similarity of the texture of the brain to that of the pancreas, and  some other glands of the body, has induced the inquirers into this subject  to believe, that a fluid, perhaps much more subtile than the electric aura,  is separated from the blood by that organ for the purposes of motion and  sensation. When we recollect, that the electric fluid itself is actually  accumulated and given out voluntarily by the torpedo and the gymnotus  electricus, that an electric shock will frequently stimulate into motion a  paralytic limb, and lastly that it needs no perceptible tubes to convey it,  this opinion seems not without probability; and the singular figure of the  brain and nervous system seems well adapted to distribute it over every  part of the body.    For the medullary substance of the brain not only occupies the cavities of  the head and spine, but passes along the innumerable ramifications of the  nerves to the various muscles and organs of sense. In these it lays aside  its coverings, and is intermixed with the slender fibres, which constitute  those muscles and organs of sense. Thus all these distant ramifications of  the sensorium are united at one of their extremities, that is, in the head  and spine; and thus these central parts of the sensorium constitute a  communication between all the organs of sense and muscles.    3. A _nerve_ is a continuation of the medullary substance of the brain from  the head or spine towards the other parts of the body, wrapped in its  proper membrane.    4. The _muscular fibres_ are moving organs intermixed with that medullary  substance, which is continued along the nerves, as mentioned above. They  are indued with the power of contraction, and are again elongated either by  antagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or by elastic ligaments. So the  muscles on one side of the forearm bend the fingers by means of their  tendons, and those on the other side of the fore-arm extend them again. The  arteries are distended by the circulating blood; and in the necks of  quadrupeds there is a strong elastic ligament, which assists the muscles,  which elevate the head, to keep it in its horizontal position, and to raise  it after it has been depressed.    5. The _immediate organs of sense_ consist in like manner of moving fibres  enveloped in the medullary substance above mentioned; and are erroneously  supposed to be simply an expansion of the nervous medulla, as the retina of  the eye, and the rete mucosum of the skin, which are the immediate organs  of vision, and of touch. Hence when we speak of the contractions of the  fibrous parts of the body, we shall mean both the contractions of the  muscles, and those of the immediate organs of sense. These _fibrous  motions_ are thus distinguished from the _sensorial motions_ above  mentioned.    6. The _external organs_ of sense are the coverings of the immediate organs  of sense, and are mechanically adapted for the reception or transmission of  peculiar bodies, or of their qualities, as the cornea and humours of the  eye, the tympanum of the ear, the cuticle of the fingers and tongue.    7. The word _idea_ has various meanings in the writers of metaphysic: it is  here used simply for those notions of external things, which our organs of  sense bring us acquainted with originally; and is defined a contraction, or  motion, or configuration, of the fibres, which constitute the immediate  organ of sense; which will be explained at large in another part of the  work. Synonymous with the word idea, we shall sometimes use the words  _sensual motion_ in contradistinction to _muscular motion_.    8. The word _perception_ includes both the action of the organ of sense in  consequence of the impact of external objects, and our attention to that  action; that is, it expresses both the motion of the organ of sense, or  idea, and the pain or pleasure that succeeds or accompanies it.    9. The pleasure or pain which necessarily accompanies all those perceptions  or ideas which we attend to, either gradually subsides, or is succeeded by  other fibrous motions. In the latter case it is termed _sensation_, as  explained in Sect. V. 2, and VI. 2.--The reader is intreated to keep this  in his mind, that through all this treatise the word sensation is used to  express pleasure or pain only in its active state, by whatever means it is  introduced into the system, without any reference to the stimulation of  external objects.    10. The vulgar use of the word _memory_ is too unlimited for our purpose:  those ideas which we voluntarily recall are here termed ideas of  _recollection_, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards. And those  ideas which are suggested to us by preceding ideas are here termed ideas of  _suggestion_, as whilst we repeat the alphabet in the usual order; when by  habits previously acquired B is suggested by A, and C by B, without any  effort of deliberation.    11. The word _association_ properly signifies a society or convention of  things in some respects similar to each other. We never say in common  language, that the effect is associated with the cause, though they  necessarily accompany or succeed each other. Thus the contractions of our  muscles and organs of sense may be said to be associated together, but  cannot with propriety be said to be associated with irritations, or with  volition, or with sensation; because they are caused by them, as mentioned  in Sect. IV. When fibrous contractions succeed other fibrous contractions,  the connection is termed _association_; when fibrous contractions succeed  sensorial motions, the connection is termed _causation_; when fibrous and  sensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other in progressive trains  or tribes, it is termed _catenation_ of animal motions. All these  connections are said to be produced by _habit_; that is, by frequent  repetition.    12. It may be proper to observe, that by the unavoidable idiom of our  language the ideas of perception, of recollection, or of imagination, in  the plural number signify the ideas belonging to perception, to  recollection, or to imagination; whilst the idea of perception, of  recollection, or of imagination, in the singular number is used for what is  termed \"a reflex idea of any of those operations of the sensorium.\"    13. By the word _stimulus_ is not only meant the application of external  bodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres, which excites into  action the sensorial power termed irritation; but also pleasure or pain,  when they excite into action the sensorial power termed sensation; and  desire or aversion, when they excite into action the power of volition; and  lastly, the fibrous contractions which precede association; as is further  explained in Sect. XII. 2. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. III.    THE MOTIONS OF THE RETINA DEMONSTRATED BY EXPERIMENTS.

I wish somebody would find the thing. I am  tired of seeing it lying there.\"    She tapped the floor impatiently with her slipper. Just then a woman  approached. She was dressed in the most uncompromising of mourning, and she  walked slowly, with bent head, never glancing at the lighted windows on  either side.    \"She will see it,\" commented Miss Terry. And sure enough, she did. She  stopped at the doorstep, drew her skirts aside, and bent over to look at  the strange-shaped box at her feet. Finally she lifted it But immediately  she shivered and acted so strangely that Miss Terry thought she was about  to break the toy in pieces on the steps or throw it into the street.  Evidently she detested the sight of it.    Just then up came a second woman with two small boys hanging at her skirts.  They were ragged and sick-looking. There was something about the expression  of even the tiny knot of hair at the back of the woman's head which told of  anxious poverty. With envious curiosity she hurried up to see what a  luckier mortal had found, crowding to look over her shoulder. The woman in  black drew haughtily away and clutched the Noah's ark with a gesture of  proprietorship.    \"Go away! This is my affair.\" Miss Terry read her expression and sniffed.  \"There is the Christmas spirit coming out again,\" she said to herself.  \"Look at her face!\"    The black-gowned woman prepared to move on with the toy under her arm. But  the second woman caught hold of her skirt and began to speak earnestly. She  pointed to the Noah's ark, then to her two children. Her eyes were  beseeching. The little boys crowded forward eagerly. But some wicked  spirit seemed to have seized the finder of the ark. Angrily she shook off  the hand of the other woman, and clutching the box yet more firmly under  her arm, she hurried away. Once, twice, she turned and shook her head at  the ragged woman who followed her. Then, with a savage gesture at the two  children, she disappeared beyond Miss Terry's straining eyes. The poor  woman and her boys followed forlornly at a distance.    \"They really wanted it, that old Noah's ark!\" exclaimed Miss Terry in  amazement. \"I can scarcely believe it. But why did that other creature keep  the thing? I see! Only because she found they cared for it. Well, that is a  happy spirit for Christmas time, I should say! Humph! I did not expect to  find anything quite so mean as _that!_\"          CHAPTER V    MIRANDA      Miss Terry returned to the fireside, fumbled in the box, and drew out a  doll. She was an ugly, old-fashioned doll, with bruised waxen face of no  particular color. Her mop of flaxen hair was straggling and uneven, much  the worse for the attention of generations of moths. She wore a faded green  silk dress in the style of Lincoln's day, and a primitive bonnet, evidently  made by childish hands. She was a strange, dead-looking figure, with pale  eyelids closed, as Miss Terry dragged her from the box. But when she was  set upright the lids snapped open and a pair of bright blue eyes looked  straight into those of Miss Terry. It was so sudden that the lady nearly  gasped.    \"Miranda!\" she exclaimed. \"It is old Miranda! I have not thought of her for  years.\" She held the doll at arm's length, gazing fixedly at her for some  minutes.    \"I cannot burn her,\" she muttered at last. \"It would seem almost like  murder. I don't like to throw her away, but I have vowed to get rid of  these things to-night. And I'll do it, anyway. Yes, I'll make an experiment  of her. I wonder what sort of trouble she will cause.\"    Not even Miss Terry could think of seeing old Miranda lying exposed to the  winter night. She found a piece of paper, rolled up the doll in a neat  package, and tied it with red string. It was, to look upon, entirely a  tempting package. Once more she stole down the steps and hesitated where to  leave Miranda: not on the sidewalk,--for some reason that seemed  impossible. But near the foot of the flight of steps leading to the front  door she deposited the doll. The white package shone out plainly in the  illuminated street. There was no doubt that it would be readily seen.    With a quite unexplainable interest Miss Terry watched to see what would  happen to Miranda. She waited for some time. The street seemed deserted.  Miss Terry caught the faint sound of singing. The choristers were passing  through a neighboring street, and doubtless all wayfarers within hearing of  their voices were following in their wake.    She was thoroughly interested in her grim joke, but she was becoming  impatient. Were there to be no more passers? Must the doll stay there  unreclaimed until morning? Presently she became aware of a child's figure  drawing near. It was a little girl of about ten, very shabbily dressed,  with tangled yellow curls hanging over her shoulders. There was something  familiar about her appearance, Miss Terry could not say what it was. She  came hurrying along the sidewalk with a preoccupied air, and seemed about  to pass the steps without seeing the package lying there. But just as she  was opposite the window, her eye caught the gleam of the white paper. She  paused. She looked at it eagerly; it was such a tempting package, both as  to its size and shape! She went closer and bent down to examine it. She  took it into her bare little hands and seemed to squeeze it gently. There  is no mistaking the contours of a doll, however well it may be enveloped in  paper wrappings. The child's eyes grew more and more eager. She glanced  behind her furtively; she looked up and down the street. Then with a sudden  intuition she looked straight ahead, up the flight of steps.    [Illustration: SHE LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET]    Miss Terry read her mind accurately. She was thinking that probably the  doll belonged in that house; some one must have dropped the package while  going out or in. Would she ring the bell and return it? Miss Terry had  not thought of that possibility. But she shook her head and her lip curled.  \"Return it? Of course not! Ragged children do not usually return promising  packages which they have found,--even on Christmas Eve. Look now!\"    Once more the child glanced stealthily behind her, up and down the street.  Once more she looked up at the dark house before her, the only black spot  in a wreath of brilliancy. She did not see the face peering at her through  the curtains, a face which scanned her own half wistfully. What was to  become of Miranda? The little girl thrust the package under her ragged coat  and ran away down the street as fast as her legs could take her.    \"A thief!\" cried Miss Terry. \"That is the climax. I have detected a child  taking what she knew did not belong to her, on Christmas Eve! Where are all  their Sunday School lessons and their social improvement classes? I knew  it! This Christmas spirit that one hears so much about is nothing but an  empty sham. I have proved it to my satisfaction to-night. I will burn the  rest of these toys, every one of them, and then go to bed. It is too  disgusting! She was a nice-looking child, too. Poor old Miranda!\"    With something like a sigh Miss Terry strode back to the fire, where the  play box stood gaping. She had made but a small inroad upon its heaped-up  treasures. She threw herself listlessly into the chair and began to pull  over the things. Broken games and animals, dolls' dresses painfully  tailored by unskilled fingers, disjointed members,--sorry relics of past  pleasures,--one by one Miss Terry seized them between disdainful thumb and  finger and tossed them into the fire. Her face showed not a qualm at  parting with these childhood treasures; only the stern sense of a good  housekeeper's duty fulfilled. With queer contortions the bits writhed on  the coals, and finally flared into dissolution, vanishing up chimney in a  shower of sparks to the heaven of spent toys.          CHAPTER VI    THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL      Almost at the bottom of the box Miss Terry's fingers closed about a small  object. Once more she drew out the papier-mache Angel which had so excited  the wonder of Norah when once before that evening it had come to light.    Miss Terry held it up and looked at it with the same expression on her  face, half tender, half contemptuous. \"The Christmas Angel!\" she murmured  involuntarily, as she had done before. And again there flashed through her  mind a vivid picture.    It was the day before Christmas, fifty years earlier. She and her brother  Tom were trimming the Christmas tree in this very library. She saw Tom, in  a white pique suit with short socks that were always slipping down his fat  legs. She saw herself in a white dress and blue ribbons, pouting in a  corner. They had been quarreling about the Christmas tree, disputing as to  which of them should light the first candle when the time arrived. Then  their mother came to them smiling, a sweet-faced lady who seemed not to  notice the red faces and the tears. She put something into Tom's hand  saying, \"This is the Christmas Angel of peace and good-will. Hang it on the  tree, children, so that it may shed a blessing on all who come here to give  and to receive.\"    How lovely and pink it looked in Tom's hand! Little Angelina had thought it  the most beautiful thing she had ever seen,--and holy, too, as if it had  some blessed charm. Fiddlestick! What queer fancies children have! Miss  Terry remembered how a strange thrill had crept through Angelina as she  gazed at it. Then she and Tom looked at each other and were ashamed of  their quarrel. Suddenly Tom held out the Angel to his sister. \"You hang it  on the tree, Angelina,\" he said magnanimously. \"I know you want to.\"    But she--little fool!--she too had a fit of generosity.    \"No, you hang it, Tom. You're taller,\" she said.    \"I'll hang it at the very top of the tree!\" he replied, nothing loath.  Eagerly he mounted the step-ladder,"]]]
