So when Jan came home, she up  and said to him, \"Jan, what is that bag of groats on the tester for?\"    \"That is for Hereafterthis, my dear.\"    Now, there was a robber outside the window, and he heard what Jan said.  Next day, he waited till Jan had gone to market, and then he came and  knocked at the door. \"What do you please to want?\" said Mally.    \"I am Hereafterthis,\" said the robber, \"I have come for the bag of  groats.\"    Now the robber was dressed like a fine gentleman, so she thought to  herself it was very kind of so fine a man to come for the bag of groats,  so she ran upstairs and fetched the bag of groats, and gave it to the  robber and he went away with it.    When Jan came home, she said to him, \"Jan, Hereafterthis has been for  the bag of groats.\"    \"What do you mean, wife?\" said Jan.    So she up and told him, and he said, \"Then I'm a ruined man, for that  money was to pay our rent with. The only thing we can do is to roam the  world over till we find the bag of groats.\" Then Jan took the house-door  off its hinges, \"That's all we shall have to lie on,\" he said. So Jan  put the door on his back, and they both set out to look for  Hereafterthis. Many a long day they went, and in the night Jan used to  put the door on the branches of a tree, and they would sleep on it. One  night they came to a big hill, and there was a high tree at the foot. So  Jan put the door up in it, and they got up in the tree and went to  sleep. By-and-by Jan's wife heard a noise, and she looked to see what it  was. It was an opening of a door in the side of the hill. Out came two  gentlemen with a long table, and behind them fine ladies and gentlemen,  each carrying a bag, and one of them was Hereafterthis with the bag of  groats. They sat round the table, and began to drink and talk and count  up all the money in the bags. So then Jan's wife woke him up, and asked  what they should do.    \"Now's our time,\" said Jan, and he pushed the door off the branches,  and it fell right in the very middle of the table, and frightened the  robbers so that they all ran away. Then Jan and his wife got down from  the tree, took as many money-bags as they could carry on the door, and  went straight home. And Jan bought his wife more cows, and more pigs,  and they lived happy ever after.          The Golden Ball      There were two lasses, daughters of one mother, and as they came from  the fair, they saw a right bonny young man stand at the house-door  before them. They never saw such a bonny man before. He had gold on his  cap, gold on his finger, gold on his neck, a red gold watch-chain--eh!  but he had brass. He had a golden ball in each hand. He gave a ball to  each lass, and she was to keep it, and if she lost it, she was to be  hanged. One of the lasses, 't was the youngest, lost her ball. I'll tell  thee how. She was by a park-paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it  went up, and up, and up, till it went fair over the paling; and when she  climbed up to look, the ball ran along the green grass, and it went  right forward to the door of the house, and the ball went in and she saw  it no more.    So she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead because  she'd lost her ball.    But she had a sweetheart, and he said he would go and get the ball. So  he went to the park-gate, but 't was shut; so he climbed the hedge, and  when he got to the top of the hedge, an old woman rose up out of the  dyke before him, and said, if he wanted to get the ball, he must sleep  three nights in the house. He said he would.    Then he went into the house, and looked for the ball, but could not find  it. Night came on and he heard bogles move in the courtyard; so he  looked out o' the window, and the yard was full of them.    Presently he heard steps coming upstairs. He hid behind the door, and  was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as tall as  he, and the giant looked round but did not see the lad, so he went to  the window and bowed to look out; and as he bowed on his elbows to see  the bogles in the yard, the lad stepped behind him, and with one blow of  his sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part of him fell in the  yard, and the bottom part stood looking out of the window.    There was a great cry from the bogles when they saw half the giant come  tumbling down to them, and they called out, \"There comes half our  master, give us the other half.\"    So the lad said, \"It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standing  alone at the window, as thou hast no eye to see with, so go join thy  brother;\" and he cast the lower part of the giant after the top part.  Now when the bogles had gotten all the giant they were quiet.    Next night the lad was at the house again, and now a second giant came  in at the door, and as he came in the lad cut him in twain, but the legs  walked on to the chimney and went up them. \"Go, get thee after thy  legs,\" said the lad to the head, and he cast the head up the chimney  too.    The third night the lad got into bed, and he heard the bogles striving  under the bed, and they had the ball there, and they were casting it to  and fro.    Now one of them has his leg thrust out from under the bed, so the lad  brings his sword down and cuts it off. Then another thrusts his arm out  at other side of the bed, and the lad cuts that off. So at last he had  maimed them all, and they all went crying and wailing off, and forgot  the ball, but he took it from under the bed, and went to seek his  true-love.    Now the lass was taken to York to be hanged; she was brought out on the  scaffold, and the hangman said, \"Now, lass, thou must hang by the neck  till thou be'st dead.\" But she cried out:         \"Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming!       O mother, hast brought my golden ball         And come to set me free?\"         \"I've neither brought thy golden ball         Nor come to set thee free,       But I have come to see thee hung         Upon this gallows-tree.\"    Then the hangman said, \"Now, lass, say thy prayers for thou must die.\"  But she said:         \"Stop, stop, I think I see my father coming!       O father, hast brought my golden ball         And come to set me free?\"         \"I've neither brought thy golden ball         Nor come to set thee free,       But I have come to see thee hung         Upon this gallows-tree.\"    Then the hangman said, \"Hast thee done thy prayers? Now, lass, put thy  head into the noose.\"    But she answered, \"Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming!\" And  again she sang, and then she thought she saw her sister coming, then her  uncle, then her aunt, then her cousin; but after this the hangman said,  \"I will stop no longer, thou 'rt making game of me. Thou must be hung at  once.\"    But now she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd, and he held  over his head in the air her own golden ball; so she said:         \"Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart coming!       Sweetheart, hast brought my golden ball         And come to set me free?\"         \"Aye, I have brought thy golden ball         And come to set thee free,       I have not come to see thee hung         Upon this gallows-tree.\"    And he took her home, and they lived happy ever after.          My Own Self      In a tiny house in the North Countrie, far away from any town or  village, there lived not long ago, a poor widow all alone with her  little son, a six-year-old boy.    The house-door opened straight on to the hill-side and all round about  were moorlands and huge stones, and swampy hollows; never a house nor a  sign of life wherever you might look, for their nearest neighbours were  the \"ferlies\" in the glen below, and the \"will-o'-the-wisps\" in the long  grass along the pathside.    And many a tale she could tell of the \"good folk\" calling to each other  in the oak-trees, and the twinkling lights hopping on to the very window  sill, on dark nights; but in spite of the loneliness, she lived on from  year to year in the little house, perhaps because she was never asked to  pay any rent for it.    But she did not care to sit up late, when the fire burnt low, and no one  knew what might be about; so, when they had had their supper she would  make up a good fire and go off to bed, so that if anything terrible  _did_ happen, she could always hide her head under the bed-clothes.    This, however, was far too early to please her little son; so when she  called him to bed, he would go on playing beside the fire, as if he did  not hear her.    He had always been bad to do with since the day he was born, and his  mother did not often care to cross him; indeed, the more she tried to  make him obey her, the less heed he paid to anything she said, so it  usually ended by his taking his own way.    But one night, just at the fore-end of winter, the widow could not make  up her mind to go off to bed, and leave him playing by the fireside; for  the wind was tugging at the door, and rattling the window-panes, and  well she knew that on such a night, fairies and such like were bound to  be out and about, and bent on mischief. So she tried to coax the boy  into going at once to bed:    \"The safest bed to bide in, such a night as this!\" she said: but no, he  wouldn't.    Then she threatened to \"give him the stick,\" but it was no use.    The more she begged and scolded, the more he shook his head; and when at  last she lost patience and cried that the fairies would surely come and  fetch him away, he only laughed and said he wished they _would_, for he  would like one to play with.    At that his mother burst into tears, and went off to bed in despair,  certain that after such words something dreadful would happen; while her  naughty little son sat on his stool by the fire, not at all put out by  her crying.    But he had not long been sitting there alone, when he heard a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#3)"],[1,"sense perceptions  connected with it. That is to say, there are some that only music can  convey: those connected with sound; others that only painting,  sculpture, or architecture can convey: those connected with the form and  colour that they severally deal with.    In abstract form and colour--that is, form and colour unconnected with  natural appearances--there is an emotional power, such as there is in  music, the sounds of which have no direct connection with anything in  nature, but only with that mysterious sense we have, the sense of  Harmony, Beauty, or Rhythm (all three but different aspects of the same  thing).    This inner sense is a very remarkable fact, and will be found to some  extent in all, certainly all civilised, races. And when the art of a  remote people like the Chinese and Japanese is understood, our senses of  harmony are found to be wonderfully in agreement. Despite the fact that  their art has developed on lines widely different from our own, none the  less, when the surprise at its newness has worn off and we begin to  understand it, we find it conforms to very much the same sense of  harmony.    But apart from the feelings connected directly with the means of  expression, there appears to be much in common between all the arts in  their most profound expression; there seems to be a common centre in our  inner life that they all appeal to. Possibly at this centre are the  great primitive emotions common to all men. The religious group, the  deep awe and reverence men feel when contemplating the great mystery of  the Universe and their own littleness in the face of its vastness--the  desire to correspond and develop relationship with the something outside  themselves that is felt to be behind and through all things. Then there  are those connected with the joy of life, the throbbing of the great  life spirit, the gladness of being, the desire of the sexes; and also  those connected with the sadness and mystery of death and decay, &c.    The technical side of an art is, however, not concerned with these  deeper motives but with the things of sense through which they find  expression; in the case of painting, the visible universe.    The artist is capable of being stimulated to artistic expression by all  things seen, no matter what; to him nothing comes amiss. Great pictures  have been made of beautiful people in beautiful clothes and of squalid  people in ugly clothes, of beautiful architectural buildings and the  ugly hovels of the poor. And the same painter who painted the Alps  painted the Great Western Railway.    The visible world is to the artist, as it were, a wonderful garment, at  times revealing to him the Beyond, the Inner Truth there is in all  things. He has a consciousness of some correspondence with something the  other side of visible things and dimly felt through them, a \"still,  small voice\" which he is impelled to interpret to man. It is the  expression of this all-pervading inner significance that I think we  recognise as beauty, and that prompted Keats to say:         \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\"    And hence it is that the love of truth and the love of beauty can exist  together in the work of the artist. The search for this inner truth is  the search for beauty. People whose vision does not penetrate beyond the  narrow limits of the commonplace, and to whom a cabbage is but a vulgar  vegetable, are surprised if they see a beautiful picture painted of one,  and say that the artist has idealised it, meaning that he has  consciously altered its appearance on some idealistic formula; whereas  he has probably only honestly given expression to a truer, deeper vision  than they had been aware of. The commonplace is not the true, but only  the shallow, view of things.    [Illustration: Plate II.    DRAWING BY LEONARDO DA VINCI FROM THE ROYAL COLLECTION AT WINDSOR    _Copyright photo, Braun & Co._]    Fromentin's         \"Art is the expression of the invisible by means of the visible\"    expresses the same idea, and it is this that gives to art its high place  among the works of man.    Beautiful things seem to put us in correspondence with a world the  harmonies of which are more perfect, and bring a deeper peace than this  imperfect life seems capable of yielding of itself. Our moments of peace  are, I think, always associated with some form of beauty, of this spark  of harmony within corresponding with some infinite source without. Like  a mariner's compass, we are restless until we find repose in this one  direction. In moments of beauty (for beauty is, strictly speaking, a  state of mind rather than an attribute of certain objects, although  certain things have the power of inducing it more than others) we seem  to get a glimpse of this deeper truth behind the things of sense. And  who can say but that this sense, dull enough in most of us, is not an  echo of a greater harmony existing somewhere the other side of things,  that we dimly feel through them, evasive though it is.    But we must tread lightly in these rarefied regions and get on to more  practical concerns. By finding and emphasising in his work those  elements in visual appearances that express these profounder things, the  painter is enabled to stimulate the perception of them in others.    In the representation of a fine mountain, for instance, there are,  besides all its rhythmic beauty of form and colour, associations  touching deeper chords in our natures--associations connected with its  size, age, and permanence, &c.; at any rate we have more feelings than  form and colour of themselves are capable of arousing. And these things  must be felt by the painter, and his picture painted under the influence  of these feelings, if he is instinctively to select those elements of  form and colour that convey them. Such deeper feelings are far too  intimately associated even with the finer beauties of mere form and  colour for the painter to be able to neglect them; no amount of  technical knowledge will take the place of feeling, or direct the  painter so surely in his selection of what is fine.    There are those who would say, \"This is all very well, but the painter's  concern is with form and colour and paint, and nothing else. If he  paints the mountain faithfully from that point of view, it will suggest  all these other associations to those who want them.\" And others who  would say that the form and colour of appearances are only to be used as  a language to give expression to the feelings common to all men. \"Art  for art's sake\" and \"Art for subject's sake.\" There are these two  extreme positions to consider, and it will depend on the individual on  which side his work lies. His interest will be more on the aesthetic  side, in the feelings directly concerned with form and colour; or on the  side of the mental associations connected with appearances, according to  his temperament. But neither position can neglect the other without  fatal loss. The picture of form and colour will never be able to escape  the associations connected with visual things, neither will the picture  all for subject be able to get away from its form and colour. And it is  wrong to say \"If he paints the mountain faithfully from the form and  colour point of view it will suggest all those other associations to  those who want them,\" unless, as is possible with a simple-minded  painter, he be unconsciously moved by deeper feelings, and impelled to  select the significant things while only conscious of his paint. But the  chances are that his picture will convey the things he was thinking  about, and, in consequence, instead of impressing us with the grandeur  of the mountain, will say something very like \"See what a clever painter  I am!\" Unless the artist has painted his picture under the influence of  the deeper feelings the scene was capable of producing, it is not likely  anybody will be so impressed when they look at his work.    And the painter deeply moved with high ideals as to subject matter, who  neglects the form and colour through which he is expressing them, will  find that his work has failed to be convincing. The immaterial can only  be expressed through the material in art, and the painted symbols of the  picture must be very perfect if subtle and elusive meanings are to be  conveyed. If he cannot paint the commonplace aspect of our mountain, how  can he expect to paint any expression of the deeper things in it? The  fact is, both positions are incomplete. In all good art the matter  expressed and the manner of its expression are so intimate as to have  become one. The deeper associations connected with the mountain are only  matters for art in so far as they affect its appearance and take shape  as form and colour in the mind of the artist, informing the whole  process of the painting, even to the brush strokes. As in a good poem,  it is impossible to consider the poetic idea apart from the words that  express it: they are fired together at its creation.    Now an expression by means of one of our different sense perceptions  does not constitute art, or the boy shouting at the top of his voice,  giving expression to his delight in life but making a horrible noise,  would be an artist. If his expression is to be adequate to convey his  feeling to others, there must be some arrangement. The expression must  be ordered, rhythmic, or whatever word most fitly conveys the idea of  those powers, conscious or unconscious, that select and arrange the  sensuous material of art, so as to make the most telling impression, by  bringing it into relation with our innate sense of harmony. If we can  find a rough definition that will include all the arts, it will help us  to see in what direction lie those things in painting that make it an  art. The not uncommon idea, that painting is \"the production by means of  colours of more or less perfect representations of natural objects\" will  not do. And it is"]]]
