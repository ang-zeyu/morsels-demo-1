They may have succeeded, by dint of official  authority, in silencing such inquiries, but they have failed to give a  satisfactory answer to the questions proposed.    Long received opinions may, in some cases, become law, pleading no other  reason than antiquity. But this is an age of investigation, which  demands the most lucid and unequivocal proof of the point assumed. The  dogmatism of the schoolmen will no longer satisfy. The dark ages of  mental servility are passing away. The day light of science has long  since dawned upon the world, and the noon day of truth, reason, and  virtue, will ere long be established on a firm and immutable basis. The  human mind, left free to investigate, will gradually advance onward in  the course of knowledge and goodness marked out by the Creator, till it  attains to that perfection which shall constitute its highest glory, its  truest bliss.    You will perceive, at once, that our inquiries thro out these lectures  will not be bounded by what has been said or written on the subject. We  take a wider range. We adopt no sentiment because it is ancient or  popular. We refer to no authority but what proves itself to be correct.  And we ask no one to adopt our opinions any farther than they agree with  the fixed laws of nature in the regulation of matter and thought, and  apply in common practice among men.    Have we not a right to expect, in return, that you will be equally  honest to yourselves and the subject before us? So far as the errors of  existing systems shall be exposed, will you not reject them, and adopt  whatever appears conclusively true and practically useful? Will you, can  you, be satisfied to adopt for yourselves and teach to others, systems  of grammar, for no other reason than because they are old, and claim the  support of the learned and honorable?    Such a course, generally adopted, would give the ever-lasting quietus to  all improvement. It would be a practical adoption of the philosophy of  the Dutchman, who was content to carry his grist in one end of the sack  and a stone to balance it in the other, assigning for a reason, that his  honored father had always done so before him. Who would be content to  adopt the astrology of the ancients, in preferance to astronomy as now  taught, because the latter is more modern? Who would spend three years  in transcribing a copy of the Bible, when a better could be obtained  for one dollar, because manuscripts were thus procured in former times?  What lady would prefer to take her cards, wheel, and loom, and spend a  month or two in manufacturing for herself a dress, when a better could  be earned in half the time, merely because her respected grandmother did  so before her? Who would go back a thousand years to find a model for  society, rejecting all improvements in the arts and sciences, because  they are innovations, encroachments upon the opinions and practices of  learned and honorable men?    I can not believe there is a person in this respected audience whose  mind is in such voluntary slavery as to induce the adoption of such a  course. I see before me minds which sparkle in every look, and thoughts  which are ever active, to acquire what is true, and adopt what is  useful. And I flatter myself that the time spent in the investigation of  the science of language will not be unpleasant or unprofitable.    I feel the greater confidence from the consideration that your minds are  yet untrammeled; not but what many, probably most of you, have already  studied the popular systems of grammar, and understood them; if such a  thing is possible; but because you have shown a disposition to learn, by  becoming members of this Institute, the object of which is the  improvement of its members.    Let us therefore make an humble attempt, with all due candor and  discretion, to enter upon the inquiry before us with an unflinching  determination to push our investigations beyond all reasonable doubt,  and never rest satisfied till we have conquered all conquerable  obstacles, and come into the possession of the light and liberty of  truth.    The attempt here made will not be considered unimportant, by those who  have known the difficulties attending the study of language. If any  course can be marked out to shorten the time tediously spent in the  acquisition of what is rarely attained--a thoro knowledge of language--a  great benefit will result to the community; children will save months  and years to engage in other useful attainments, and the high  aspirations of the mind for truth and knowledge will not be curbed in  its first efforts to improve by a set of technical and arbitrary rules.  They will acquire a habit of thinking, of deep reflection; and never  adopt, for fact, what appears unreasonable or inconsistent, merely  because great or good men have said it is so. They will feel an  independence of their own, and adopt a course of investigation which  cannot fail of the most important consequences. It is not the saving of  time, however, for which we propose a change in the system of teaching  language. In this respect, it is the study of one's life. New facts are  constantly developing themselves, new combinations of ideas and words  are discovered, and new beauties presented at every advancing step. It  is to acquire a knowledge of correct principles, to induce a habit of  correct thinking, a freedom of investigation, and at that age when the  character and language of life are forming. It is, in short, to exhibit  before you truth of the greatest practical importance, not only to you,  but to generations yet unborn, in the most essential affairs of human  life, that I have broached the hated subject of grammar, and undertaken  to reflect light upon this hitherto dark and disagreeable subject.    With a brief sketch of the outlines of language, as based on the fixed  laws of nature, and the agreement of those who employ it, I shall  conclude the present lecture.    We shall consider all language as governed by the invariable laws of  nature, and as depending on the conventional regulations of men.    Words are the signs of ideas. Ideas are the impressions of things.  Hence, in all our attempts to investigate the important principles of  language, we shall employ the sign as the means of coming at the thing  signified.    Language has usually been considered under four divisions, viz.:  Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.    Orthography is _right spelling_; the combination of certain letters into  words in such a manner as to agree with the spoken words used to denote  an idea. We shall not labor this point, altho we conceive a great  improvement might be effected in this department of learning. My only  wish is to select from all the forms of spelling, the most simple and  consistent. Constant changes are taking place in the method of making  words, and we would not refuse to cast in our mite to make the standard  more correct and easy. We would prune off by degrees all unnecessary  appendages, as unsounded or italic letters, and write out words so as to  be capable of a distinct pronunciation. But this change must be  _gradually_ effected. From the spelling adopted two centuries ago, a  wonderful improvement has taken place. And we have not yet gone beyond  the possibility of improvement. Let us not be too sensitive on this  point, nor too tenacious of old forms. Most of our dictionaries differ  in many respects in regard to the true system of orthography, and our  true course is to adopt every improvement which is offered. Thro out  this work we shall spell some words different from what is customary,  but intend not, thereby, to incur the ignominy of bad spellers. Let  small improvements be adopted, and our language may soon be redeemed  from the difficulties which have perplexed beginners in their first  attempts to convey ideas by written words.[1]    In that department of language denominated Etymology, we shall contend  that all words are reducible to two general classes, nouns and verbs;  or, _things_ and _actions_. We shall, however, admit of subdivisions,  and treat of pronouns, adjectives, and contractions. We shall contend  for only two cases of nouns, one kind of pronouns, one kind of verbs,  that all are active; three modes, and as many tenses; that articles,  adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections, have no  distinctive character, no existence, in fact, to warrant a \"local  habitation or a name.\"    In the composition of sentences, a few general rules of Syntax may be  given; but the principal object to be obtained, is the possession of  correct ideas derived from a knowledge of things, and the most approved  words to express them; the combination of words in a sentence will  readily enough follow.    Prosody relates to the quantity of syllables, rules of accent and  pronunciation, and the arrangement of syllables and words so as to  produce harmony. It applies specially to versification. As our object is  not to make poets, who, it is said, \"are born, and not made,\" but to  teach the true principles of language, we shall give no attention to  this finishing stroke of composition.    In our next we shall lay before you the principles upon which all  language depends, and the process by which its use is to be acquired.          LECTURE II.

All language depends on two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17606"],[0,"Throwing-sticks in the National Museum (#3)"],[1,"to  the spiral, twisted form of the Eskimo skin-scraper (Fig. 9). On the  whole, these implements are quite similar to the next group. A section  across the middle of the implement would be trapezoidal with incurved  sides. In two of the specimens not figured these curved sides are  brought upward until they join the upper surface, making a graceful  ornament. The handles are not symmetrical, the sides for the thumb being  shaved out so as to fit the muscles conveniently. Places for the fingers  are provided thus: There is an index-finger cavity quite through the  stick indeed, but the index-finger catches in the interior of the wood  and does not pass through as in the eastern Arctic types. The middle  finger rests against an ivory or wooden peg. This is the first  appearance of this feature. It will be noted after this on all the  throwing-sticks as the most prominent feature until we come to Kadiak,  but the Unalashkans do not use it on their throwing-sticks. Cavities for  the three last finger-tips are not always present, and the hooks at the  distal ends for the extremities of the weapons are very large plugs of  wood or ivory and have beveled edges rather than points for the  reception of the butt end of the weapon to be thrown.      NORTON SOUND TYPES.    These types extend from Cape Darby around to Cape Dyer, including part  of Kaviagmut, the Mahlemut, the Unaligmut, and the Ekogmut area of Dall,  and extending up the Yukon River as far as the Eskimo, who use this  weapon. The characteristics are the same as those of the last named  area, excepting that in many specimens there are two finger-pegs instead  of one, the first peg inclosing the middle finger, the second the  ring-finger and the little finger (Figs. 10-13). A single specimen  collected by Lucien Turner at Saint Michael's has no index cavity, the  forefinger resting on the first peg and the other three fingers passing  between this and the outer peg (Fig. 14). Another specimen of Nelson's,  marked Sabotinsky, has the index-finger cavity and one finger-peg. The  finger-tip cavity on the upper surface of the handle forms the figure of  a water-bird, in which the heart is connected with the mouth by a curved  line, just as in the pictography of the more southern Indians.    The Yukon River Eskimo use a throwing-stick quite similar to the Norton  Sound type. The characteristics are very pronounced. Thumb-groove deep,  index-finger cavity so long as to include the first joint. The hook for  the spear-end formed by the edge of a plug of hard wood. The middle  finger is separated by a deep groove and peg. The ring and little finger  are inclosed by the peg and a sharp projection at the upper end of the  handle.      NUNIVAK ISLAND AND CAPE VANCOUVER TYPE.    In this region a great change comes over the throwing-stick, just as  though it had been stopped by Cape Romanzoff, or new game had called for  modification, or a mixing of new peoples had modified their tools (Figs.  15-17). The index-finger cavity and the hole for the index finger are  here dropped entirely, after extending from Greenland uninterruptedly to  Cape Romanzoff. The handle is conspicuously wide, while the body of the  implement is very slender and light. The thumb-groove is usually  chamfered out very thoroughly so as to fit the flexor muscle  conveniently. There are frequently finger-grooves and finger-tip  cavities in addition to the pegs. The cavity for the index finger having  disappeared, provision is made for that important part of the hand by a  separate peg and groove. The middle finger is also pegged off, and the  last two fingers have to shift for themselves. The hook for the shaft of  the weapon has a fine point like a little bead, the whole implement  being adapted to the light seal-harpoon darts. Mr. Dall collected a  large number of two-pegged sticks from Nunivak Island and four  three-pegged sticks labeled the same. Mr. Nelson also collected four  three-pegged sticks, but labels them Kushunuk; Cape Vancouver, on the  mainland opposite Nunivak (Fig. 17). In these three-pegged sticks the  ring-finger and the little finger are inclosed together. This should be  compared with Mr. Turner's Saint Michael specimen, in which the last  three fingers are inclosed together (Fig. 14). It remains to be seen and  is worthy of investigation whether crossing a narrow channel would add a  peg to the throwing-stick. One of these Nunivak specimens is  left-handed.      BRISTOL BAY TYPE.    The throwing-stick from Bristol Bay resembles in general characteristics  those from Nunivak Island and Cape Vancouver. In outline it has the  shape of the broadsword. Its cross-section is bayonet-shaped. It has no  distinct handle beyond a slight projection from the end. The  thumb-groove is shallow and chamfered on the lower side to fit exactly.  There is a long, continuous notch for the four fingers, in which the  index finger and the middle finger are set off by pegs. There is a  depression, more or less profound, to receive the tips of the fingers.  The groove for the harpoon or spear-shaft is at the lower extremity and  runs out entirely near the index finger. The ivory plug at its lower  extremity is beveled to receive a notch in the end of the spear or  harpoon shaft (Figs. 18-19).    A freshly-made implement, looking as if cut out by machinery, resembling  closely those just described, is labeled Kadiak. The constant traffic  between Bristol Bay and Kadiak, across the Alaskan peninsula, may  account for the great similarity of these implements. Furthermore, since  the natives in this region and southward have been engaged for more than  a century in fur-sealing for the whites, there is not the slightest  doubt that implements made by whites have been introduced and slightly  modified by the wearer to fit his hand.      KADIAK OR UNALASHKA TYPE.    In the National Museum are four throwing-sticks, one of them  left-handed, exactly alike--two of them marked Kadiak and two Unalashka  (Figs. 20-22). They return to the more primitive type of the area from  Kotzebue Sound to Greenland, indicating that the implement culminated in  Norton Sound. In outline this southern form is thin and straight-sided,  and those in possession are all of hard wood. The back is carved in  ridges to fit the palm of the hand and muscles of the thumb. There is no  thumb-groove, the eccentric index-finger hole of the Northern and  Eastern Eskimo is present in place of the central cavity of the area  from Kotzebue Sound to Cape Vancouver, and there is a slight groove for  the middle finger. Marks 5 and 6 are wanting. The shaft-groove is very  slight, even at its lower extremity, and runs out in a few inches toward  the handle. The hook for the end of the weapon resembles that of  Nunivak, but is more rounded at the point. Of the Eskimo of Prince  William Sound, the extreme southern area of the Eskimo on the Pacific,  Captain Cook says, in the narrative of his last voyage: \"Their longer  darts are thrown by means of a piece of wood about a foot long, with a  small groove in the middle which receives the dart. At the bottom is a  hole for the reception of one finger, which enables them to grasp the  piece of wood much firmer and to throw with greater force.\" Captain  Cook's implement corresponds exactly to the specimens just described and  renders it probable that this thin, parallel-sided, shallow-grooved  throwing-stick, with index-finger hole placed at one side of the  spear-shaft groove, extended all along the southern border of Eskimoland  as far as the Aleuts of Unalashka and Attoo. In addition to the  information furnished by the specimens in hand, Dr. Stejneger describes  a similar stick in use in the island of Attoo. On the contrary, Mr.  Elliott assures me that Aleutian fur-sealers of Pribylov Island use  throwing-sticks precisely similar to those of Norton Sound and Nunivak.    This list might be extended further by reference to authorities, but  that is from the purpose of this article and the series of ethnological  papers commenced in this volume. The most perfect throwing-stick of all  is that of the Mahlemut, in Norton Sound, in which are present the  handle, thumb-groove, finger-grooves, and pegs, cavities for the  finger-tips, index finger cavity, shaft-groove, and hook for the  harpoon. In short, all the characteristics present on the rest are  combined here.    Classifications of these implements may be varied according to the organ  selected. As to the hook for the attachment of the weapon, in Greenland  this is on the shaft, in all other parts of the world it is on the  throwing-stick. As to the index finger, there is for its reception, from  Point Barrow to Greenland, an eccentric hole quite through which the  finger passes. From Kotzebue Sound to Norton Sound there is a central  pocket on the back of the weapon, directly under the groove, for the  shaft of the weapon to receive the index finger. From Cape Vancouver to  Bristol Bay an ivory or wooden peg serves this purpose. At Kadiak and  Unalashka the eccentric index-finger hole returns.    It is more than probable that further investigation will destroy some of  the types herein enumerated or merge two more of them into one; but it  will not destroy the fact that in changing from one environment to  another the hyperboreans were driven to modify their throwing-stick.    A still more interesting inquiry is that concerning the origin of the  implement. It is hardly to be supposed that the simplest type, that of  Anderson River, was invented at once in its present form, for the  Australian form is ruder still, having neither hole for the index finger  nor groove for the weapon shaft. When we recall that the chief benefit  conferred by the throwing-stick is the ability to grasp firmly and  launch truly a greasy weapon from a cold hand, we naturally ask, have  the Eskimo any other device for the same purpose? They have. On the  shaft of the light-s"]]]
