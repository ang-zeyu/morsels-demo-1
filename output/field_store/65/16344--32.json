Make suggestions for better ornament, proportion, etc., and then go home  and make a new design with all the improvements you have noted.    \"The reverse of this method is, to sit down in front of the building  with T-square and triangle and translate the perspective building back  on to paper in elevation.    [Illustration: XIV. Detail of the Principal Doorway to the Basilica at  Altamura, Italy.]    \"These two methods will aid one to tell from a drawing how the building  will actually look when executed. It will give an idea of the scale of  ornament, if a cornice looks just the right size on a certain building,  the plate will tell you just how high that is. The T-square sketch is  very valuable in cultivating the sense of proportion. Draw to scale such  parts of the sketch as can be easily measured, and put in the remainder  in proportion, and make these sketches at the scale at which you are  used to working in the office. They will be of immense advantage in  giving you a sense of absolute scale.    \"There is such a thing as 'absolute scale,' and scale is not simply  proportion. A drawing might be made in good proportion, and the building  look well if executed a thousand feet long, and yet lose all its  effectiveness if executed but one hundred feet in length, the relative  proportions of the parts remaining the same. It is a fact that certain  designs, which look well on paper, will not look well in execution,  except at a large scale. Therefore it is valuable in making a sketch to  put on it some of the measurements; and freehand sketches with  measurements marked on them have a value in giving absolute scale.    \"The back of a photograph is a very convenient place on which to make  notes of the building itself, in regard to color, material, suggested  changes, etc., and will be very useful in recalling the building to  memory.    \"Measuring buildings and drawing them out to scale is solid  architectural work, and nothing else can take its place. It gives a  realization of the actual size and appearance of things, and brings to  notice the stone-jointing, sections of mouldings, vaulting, roofing, and  construction in general. Measured work must be done very accurately, or  else the results have no more value than approximate measures on  sketches.    \"The drawing should be made exactly as the building exists, without any  change or improvement, or else the drawing will lose a great deal of its  value as a basis for study. Many of Letarouilly's are nearly valueless  as data for study because he has improved on the original, and thus his  drawing does not represent the building as it actually exists.    \"A good method of measuring buildings is to measure first the general  dimensions and block out the building on paper at a small scale, then  measure up windows, columns, etc., and set off full-size sections of all  the mouldings with a strip of thin lead, such as may be had at any  whole-sale lead store: only the thinnest sheet-lead will work, as the  thicker leads are too stiff to bend. The large final drawings can then  be made away from the building. It is important to draw out the building  completely at a small scale, however, as it is very annoying when making  the final drawing far away from the building to find that some important  dimension has been forgotten.    \"The ordinary tape stretches so much in long dimensions that it is  inaccurate. It is best to get a tape with a metallic strip in it, and it  should be at least fifty feet long in order to take dimensions over all,  which is much more accurate than measuring with a short tape from point  to point.    \"The metric system is very convenient, but it is better for American  students to use the English measure that they will have to use in  practice, and take the tape over with them, for it is difficult to find  them on the Continent. A sliding measuring-rod is nearly indispensable,  and it will be most convenient to carry if it folds up to the length of  the imperial drawing pad. Two large triangles are very useful in getting  the projection of mouldings, as they can be held together to form a  right angle.\"    [Illustration: XV.

New York:  Macmillan & Co., 1894. 8vo, pp. 204, plates xii. $2.50.      The art of Northern Italy has furnished the text for a very considerable  part of the writings of Mr. Ruskin, and there is no one writer among  those who have ventured to investigate and write upon this extremely  engrossing subject whose work has so great an interest for the  architect, or in fact is of so much value to him. It is not necessary  to agree with all of Mr. Ruskin's elaborate theories or to unqualifiedly  admire his drawings in order to find much of real value in his books. No  student of architecture can afford _not_ to read \"The Stones of Venice,\"  and there are few books which should take precedence over it in the  formation of an architect's library.    Apropos of the illustrations in the last number of THE BROCHURE SERIES,  in the descriptive notices of which we had occasion to refer to Mr.  Ruskin, his latest published work will be found interesting. The title,  \"_Verona and other Lectures_,\" does not convey a very complete idea of  the contents of the book. None of the five lectures included is strictly  architectural in subject matter, and but one, the first, \"Verona and its  Rivers,\" has any direct bearing upon architecture, and this only from  the historical side. The illustrations, with a single exception from  drawings by the author, although lacking in most of the qualities of  good draughtsmanship, are well worth examination and study. Plates II.  and V., \"A Fountain at Verona,\" and \"The Castelbarco Tomb, Sta.  Anastasia, Verona,\" the first made in 1841 and the second in 1835, are  from the point of view of the architect the most interesting. They are  both pencil sketches, the first accented with a few touches of wash in  the shadows and darker portions of the drawing. Plate IX. represents the  angle of the Ducal Palace, Venice, the same given as the frontispiece in  the last issue of THE BROCHURE SERIES. It would hardly be possible to  come nearer the same point of view if the coincidence were intentional.  In the comparison which this forces upon Mr. Ruskin very naturally  suffers, as might be expected, from the fact that his training in  drawing was not the most thorough. His proportions are somewhat faulty  and the detail is only vaguely suggested, in fact this is more or less  true of all his drawings. Nevertheless the book will be welcome to many  architects for the valuable suggestions it contains both in text and  illustrations; and the author's wonderful and fascinating literary style  is here as unmistakably in evidence as in any of his older works. This  alone is sufficient inducement to tempt the reader to take it up.          #Club Notes.#      At the suggestion of several subscribers, the addresses are given below  of the secretaries of the principal architectural clubs as far as they  are known to us, but there are several omissions and possibly some  mistakes.

In other words it is hard, as thick, thunder, faith, faithful. Where it is  softened at the end of a word, an e silent must be added, as breath,  breathe; cloth, clothe.    V.    V has a sound of near affinity to that of f, as vain, vanity.        From f in the Islandick alphabet, v is only distinguished by a      diacritical point.    W.    Of w, which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel, some grammarians  have doubted whether it ever be a consonant; and not rather as it is called  a double u, or ou, as water may be resolved into ouater; but letters of the  same sound are always reckoned consonants in other alphabets: and it may be  observed, that w follows a vowel without any hiatus or difficulty of  utterance, as frosty winter.    Wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the English, which the Saxons better  expressed by hw, as, what, whence, whiting; in whore only, and sometimes in  wholesome, wh is sounded like a simple h.    X.    X begins no English word: it has the sound of ks, as axle, extraneous.    Y.    Y, when it follows a consonant, is a vowel; when it precedes either a vowel  or a diphthong, is a consonant, as ye, young. It is thought by some to be  in all cases a vowel. But it may be observed of y as of w, that it follows  a vowel without any hiatus, as rosy youth.        The chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels is, that      the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants, cannot be      uttered after a vowel, like that of all other consonants; thus we say      tu, ut; do, odd; but in wed, dew; the two sounds of w have no      resemblance to each other.    Z.    Z begins no word originally English; it has the sound, as its name izzard  or s hard expresses, of an s uttered with a closer compression of the  palate by the tongue, as freeze, froze.        In orthography I have supposed orthoepy, or just utterance of words, to      be included; orthography being only the art of expressing certain      sounds by proper characters. I have therefore observed in what words      any of the letters are mute.        Most of the writers of English grammar have given long tables of words      pronounced otherwise than they are written, and seem not sufficiently      to have considered, that of English, as of all living tongues, there is      a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquial, the other regular      and solemn. The cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain,      being made different in different mouths by negligence, unskilfulness,      or affectation. The solemn pronunciation, though by no means immutable      and permanent, is yet always less remote from the orthography, and less      liable to capricious innovation. They have however generally formed      their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they      happened to converse; and concluding that the whole nation combines to      vitiate language in one manner, have often established the jargon of      the lowest of the people as the model of speech.        For pronunciation the best general rule is, to consider those as the      most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words.        There have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement      of our orthography, which, like that of other nations, being formed by      chance, or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages,      was at first very various and uncertain, and is yet sufficiently      irregular. Of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate      orthography better to the pronunciation, without considering that this      is to measure by a shadow, to take that for a model or standard which      is changing while they apply it. Others, less absurdly indeed, but with      equal unlikelihood of success, have endeavoured to proportion the      number of letters to that of sounds, that every sound may have its own      character, and every character a single sound. Such would be the      orthography of a new language, to be formed by a synod of grammarians      upon principles of science. But who can hope to prevail on nations to      change their practice, and make all their old books useless? or what      advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion      and perplexity of such an alteration?        Some ingenious men, indeed, have endeavoured to deserve well of their      country, by writing honor and labor for honour and labour, red for read      in the preter-tense, sais for says, repete tor repeat, explane for      explain, or declame for declaim. Of these it may be said, that as they      have done no good they have done little harm; both because they have      innovated little, and because few have followed them.        The English language has properly no dialects; the style of writers has      no professed diversity in the use of words, or of their flexions and      terminations, nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care.      The oral diction is uniform in no spacious country, but has less      variation in England than in most other nations of equal extent. The      language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use,      but which are commonly of the genuine Teutonick race, and is uttered      with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough, but was probably      used by our ancestors. The northern speech is therefore not barbarous,      but obsolete. The speech in the western provinces seems to differ from      the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation, than by any      real difference which letters would express.           *       *       *       *       *    ETYMOLOGY.    Etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another, and the various  modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified; as horse,  horses; I love, I loved.    Of the ARTICLE.    The English have two articles, an or a, and the.    AN, A.    A has an indefinite signification, and means one, with some reference to  more; as This is a good book; that is, one among the books that are good;  He was killed by a sword; that is, some sword; This is a better book for a  man than a boy; that is, for one of those that are men than one of those  that are boys; An army might enter without resistance; that is, any army.    In the senses in which we use a or an in the singular, we speak in the  plural without an article; as these are good books.        I have made an the original article, because it is only the Saxon an,      or aen, one, applied to a new use, as the German ein, and the French un;      the n being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance.    Grammarians of the last age direct, that an should be used before h; whence  it appears that the English anciently asperated less. An is still used  before the silent h; as an herb, an honest man; but otherwise a; as      A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.       Shakespeare.    An or a can only be joined with a singular: the correspondent plural is the  noun without an article, as, I want a pen, I want pens; or with the  pronominal adjective some, as, I want some pens.    THE.    The has a particular and definite signification.                      The fruit    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste    Brought death into the world.       Milton.    That is, that particular fruit, and this world in which we live. So, He  giveth fodder for the cattle, and green herbs for the use of man; that is,  for those beings that are cattle, and his use that is man.    The is used in both numbers.      I am as free as Nature first made man,    Ere the base laws of servitude began,    When wild in woods the noble savage ran.       Dryden.    Many words are used without articles; as    1. Proper names, as John, Alexander, Longinus, Aristarchus, Jerusalem,  Athens, Rome, London. GOD is used as a proper name.    2. Abstract names, as blackness, witch-craft, virtue, vice, beauty,  ugliness, love, hatred, anger, good-nature, kindness.    3. Words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied: This  is not beer, but water; this is not brass, but steel.           *       *       *       *       *    Of NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE.    The relations of English nouns to words going before or following are not  expressed by cases, or changes of termination, but, as in most of the other  European languages, by prepositions, unless we may be said to have a  genitive case.    Singular.    Nom. Magister,        a Master, the Master.    Gen. Magistri,        of a Master, of the Master,                        or Master's, the Master's.    Dat. Magistro,        to a Master, to the Master.    Acc. Magistrum,       a Master, the Master.    Voc. Magister,        Master, O Master.    Abl. Magistro,        from a Master, from the Master.    Plural.    Nom. Magistri,        Masters, the Masters.    Gen. Magistrorum,     of Masters, of the Masters.    Dat. Magistris,       to Masters, to the Masters.    Acc. Magistros,       Masters, the Masters.    Voc. Magistri,        Masters, O Masters.    Abl. Magistris,       from Masters, from the Masters.    Our nouns are therefore only declined thus:    Master,     Gen. Master's.        Plur. Masters.    Scholar,    Gen. Scholar's.       Plur. Scholars.        These genitives are always written with a mark of elision, master's,      scholar's, according to an opinion long received, that the 's is a      contraction of his, as the soldier's valour, for the soldier his      valour: but this cannot be the true original, because 's is put to      female nouns, Woman's beauty; the Virgin's delicacy; Haughty Juno's      unrelenting hate; and collective nouns, as Women's"]]]
