In fact, no image is  allowed to be formed in this arrangement, but the convergent pencils are  intercepted by the concave eye-glass, and converted into parallel  emergent pencils. Now in fig. 2 the concave eye-glass is so placed as to  receive only a part of the convergent pencil A _p_ B, and this is the  arrangement usually adopted. By using a concave glass of shorter focus,  which would therefore be placed nearer to _m p_, the whole of the  convergent pencil might be received in this as in the former case. But  then the axis of the emergent pencil, instead of returning (as we see it  in fig. 1) _towards_ the axis of the telescope, would depart as much  _from_ that axis. Thus there would be no point on the axis at which the  eye could be so placed as to receive emergent pencils showing any  considerable part of the object. The difference may be compared to that  between looking through the small end of a cone-shaped roll of paper and  looking through the large end; in the former case the eye sees at once  all that is to be seen through the roll (supposed fixed in position), in  the latter the eye may be moved about so as to command the same range of  view, but _at any instant_ sees over a much smaller range.    To return to the arrangement actually employed, which is illustrated by  the common opera-glass. We see that the full illuminating power of the  telescope is not brought into play. But this is not the only objection  to the Galilean Telescope. It is obvious that if the part C D of the  object-glass were covered, the point P would not be visible, whereas, in  the astronomical arrangement no other effect is produced on the  visibility of an object, by covering part of the object-glass, than a  small loss of illumination. In other words, the dimensions of the field  of view of a Galilean Telescope depend on the size of the object-glass,  whereas in the astronomical Telescope the field of view is independent  of the size of the object-glass. The difference may be readily tested.  If we direct an opera-glass upon any object, we shall find that any  covering placed over a part of the object-glass _becomes visible_ when  we look through the instrument, interfering therefore _pro tanto_ with  the range of view. A covering similarly placed on any part of the  object-glass of an astronomical telescope does not become visible when  we look through the instrument. The distinction has a very important  bearing on the theory of telescopic vision.    In considering the application of the telescope to practical  observation, the circumstance that in the Galilean Telescope no real  image is formed, is yet more important. A real image admits of  measurement, linear or angular, while to a _virtual_ image (such an  image, for instance, as is formed by a common looking-glass) no such  process can be applied. In simple observation the only noticeable effect  of this difference is that, whereas in the astronomical Telescope a  _stop_ or diaphragm can be inserted in the tube so as to cut off what is  called the _ragged edge_ of the field of view (which includes all the  part not reached by _full pencils of light_ from the object-glass),  there is no means of remedying the corresponding defect in the Galilean  Telescope. It would be a very annoying defect in a telescope intended  for astronomical observation, since in general the edge of the field of  view is not perceptible at night. The unpleasant nature of the defect  may be seen by looking through an opera-glass, and noticing the gradual  fading away of light round the circumference of the field of view.    The properties of reflection as well as of refraction have been enlisted  into the service of the astronomical observer. The formation of an image  by means of a concave mirror is exhibited in fig. 3. As the observer's  head would be placed between the object and the mirror, if the image,  formed as in fig. 3, were to be microscopically examined, various  devices are employed in the construction of reflecting telescopes to  avoid the loss of light which would result--a loss which would be  important even with the largest mirrors yet constructed. Thus, in  Gregory's Telescope, a small mirror, having its concavity towards the  great one, is placed in the axis of the tube and forms an image which is  viewed through an aperture in the middle of the great mirror. A similar  plan is adopted in Cassegrain's Telescope, a small convex mirror  replacing the concave one. In Newton's Telescope a small inclined-plane  reflector is used, which sends the pencil of light off at right-angles  to the axis of the tube. In Herschel's Telescope the great mirror is  inclined so that the image is formed at a slight distance from the axis  of the telescope. In the two first cases the object is viewed in the  usual or direct way, the image being erect in Gregory's and inverted in  Cassegrain's. In the third the observer looks through the side of the  telescope, seeing an inverted image of the object. In the last the  observer sees the object inverted, but not altered as respects right and  left. The last-mentioned method of viewing objects is the only one in  which the observer's back is turned towards the object, yet this method  is called the _front view_--apparently _quasi lucus a non lucendo_.    [Illustration: _Fig. 3._]    It appears, then, that in all astronomical Telescopes, reflecting or  refracting, a _real image_ of an object is submitted to microscopical  examination.    Of this fact the possessor of a telescope may easily assure himself;  for if the eye-glass be removed, and a small screen be placed at the  focus of the object-glass, there will appear upon the screen a small  picture of any object towards which the tube is turned. But the image  may be viewed in another way which requires to be noticed. If the eye,  placed at a distance of five or six inches from the image, be directed  down the tube, the image will be seen as before; in fact, just as a  single convex lens of short focus is the simplest microscope, so a  simple convex lens of long focus is the simplest telescope.[1] But a  singular circumstance will immediately attract the observer's notice. A  real picture, or the image formed on the screen as in the former case,  can be viewed at varying distances; but when we view the image directly,  it will be found that for distinct vision the eye must be placed almost  exactly at a fixed distance from the image. This peculiarity is more  important than it might be thought at first sight. In fact, it is  essential that the observer who would rightly apply the powers of his  telescope, or fairly test its performance, should understand in what  respect an image formed by an object-glass or object-mirror differs from  a real object.    The peculiarities to be noted are the _curvature_, _indistinctness_, and  _false colouring_ of the image.    The curvature of the image is the least important of the three defects  named--a fortunate circumstance, since this defect admits neither of  remedy nor modification. The image of a distant object, instead of lying  in a plane, that is, forming what is technically called a _flat field_,  forms part of a spherical surface whose centre is at the centre of the  object-glass. Hence the centre of the field of view is somewhat nearer  to the eye than are the outer parts of the field. The amount of  curvature clearly depends on the extent of the field of view, and  therefore is not great in powerful telescopes. Thus, if we suppose that  the angular extent of the field is about half a degree (a large or  low-power field), the centre is nearer than the boundary of the field by  about 1-320th part only of the field's diameter.    The indistinctness of the image is partly due to the obliquity of the  pencils which form parts of the image, and partly to what is termed  _spherical aberration_. The first cause cannot be modified by the  optician's skill, and is not important when the field of view is small.  Spherical aberration causes those parts of a pencil which fall near the  boundary of a convex lens to converge to a nearer (_i.e._ shorter) focus  than those which fall near the centre. This may be corrected by a proper  selection of the forms of the two lenses which replace, in all modern  telescopes, the single lens hitherto considered.    The false colouring of the image is due to _chromatic aberration_. The  pencil of light proceeding from a point, converges, not to one point,  but to a short line of varying colour. Thus a series of coloured images  is formed, at different distances from the object-glass. So that, if a  screen were placed to receive the mean image _in focus_, a coloured  fringe due to the other images (_out of focus, and therefore too large_)  would surround the mean image.    Newton supposed that it was impossible to get rid of this defect, and  therefore turned his attention to the construction of reflectors. But  the discovery that the _dispersive_ powers of different glasses are not  proportional to their reflective powers, supplied opticians with the  means of remedying the defect. Let us clearly understand what is the  discovery referred to. If with a glass prism of a certain form we  produce a spectrum of the sun, this spectrum will be thrown a certain  distance away from the point on which the sun's rays would fall if not  interfered with. This distance depends on the _refractive_ power of the  glass. The spectrum will have a certain length, depending on the  _dispersive_ power of the glass. Now, if we change our prism for another  of exactly the same shape, but made of a different kind of glass, we  shall find the spectrum thrown to a different spot. If it appeared that  the length of the new spectrum was increased or diminished in exactly  the same proportion as its distance from the line of the sun's direct  light, it would have been hopeless to attempt to remedy chromatic  aberration.

To-day a tablet  on the balcony of No. 42 informs the passers-by that here was born  a certain Carmelite, by name, Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and  the Holy Face. Fifteen years have gone since the meeting in Heaven  of Madame Martin and her Carmelite child, and if the pilgrimage to  where the Little Flower first saw the light of day, be not so  large as that to the grave where her remains await their glorious  resurrection, it may nevertheless be numbered in thousands. And to  the English-speaking pilgrim there is an added pleasure in the  fact that her most notable convert, the first minister of the  United Free Church of Scotland to enter the True Fold, performs,  with his convert wife, the courteous duties of host.    *   *   *   *   *   *    It will not be amiss to say a brief word here on the brother and  sister of Madame Martin. Her sister--in religion, Sister Marie  Dosithea--led a life so holy at Le Mans that she was cited by Dom  Gueranger, perhaps the most distinguished Benedictine of the  nineteenth century, as the model of a perfect nun. By her own  confession, she had never been guilty from earliest childhood of  the smallest deliberate fault. She died on February 24, 1877. It  was in the convent made fragrant by such holiness that her niece  Pauline Martin, elder sister and \"little mother\" of Therese, and  for five years her Prioress at the Carmel, received her education.  And if the Little Flower may have imbibed the liturgical spirit  from her teachers, the daughters of St. Benedict in Lisieux, so  that she could say before her death: \"I do not think it is  possible for anyone to have desired more than I to assist properly  at choir and to recite perfectly the Divine Office\"--may it not be  to the influences from Le Mans that may be traced something of the  honey-sweet spirit of St. Francis de Sales which pervades the  pages of the Autobiography?    With the brother of Zelie Guerin the reader will make acquaintance  in the narrative of Therese. He was a chemist in Lisieux, and it  was there his daughter Jeanne Guerin married Dr. La Neele and his  younger child Marie entered the Carmel. Our foreign missionaries  had a warm friend in the uncle of Therese--for his charities he  was made godfather to an African King; and to the Catholic  Press--that home missionary--he was ever most devoted. Founder, at  Lisieux, of the Nocturnal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, and  a zealous member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, he was  called to his abundant reward on September 28, 1909. Verily the  lamp of faith is not extinct in the land of the Norman.    The Father of Therese, after the death of his wife, likewise made  his home in the delightful town which lies amid the beautiful  apple orchards of the valley of the Touques. Lisieux is deeply  interesting by reason of its fine old churches of St. Jacques and  St. Pierre, and its wonderful specimens of quaint houses, some of  which date from the twelfth century. In matters of faith it is  neither fervent nor hostile, and in 1877 its inhabitants little  thought that through their new citizen, Marie Francoise Therese  Martin, their town would be rendered immortal.    *   *   *   *   *   *    \"The cell at Lisieux reminds us of the cell of the Blessed Gabriel  at Isola. There is the same even tenor of way, the same  magnificant fidelity in little things, the same flames of divine  charity, consuming but concealed. Nazareth, with the simplicity of  its Child, and the calm abysmal love of Mary and Joseph--Nazareth,  adorable but imitable, gives the key to her spirit, and her  Autobiography does but repeat the lessons of the thirty hidden  years.\"[2]    And it repeats them with an unrivalled charm. \"This master of  asceticism,\" writes a biographer[3] of St. Ignatius Loyola, \"loved  the garden and loved the flowers. In the balcony of his study he  sat gazing on the stars: it was then Lainez heard him say: 'Oh,  how earth grows base to me when I look on Heaven!' . . . The like  imaginative strain, so scorned of our petty day, inhered in all  the lofty souls of that age. Even the Saints of our day speak a  less radiant language: and sanctity shows 'shorn of its rays'  through the black fog of universal utilitarianism, the materiality  which men have drawn into the very lungs of their souls.\"    This is not true of the sainted authoress of the chapters that  follow--\"less radiant,\" in the medium of a translation. In her  own inimitable pages, as in those of a Campion or an Ignatius, a  Teresa of Avila, or a John of the Cross--the Spirit of Poetry is  the handmaiden of Holiness. This new lover of flowers and student  of the stars, this \"strewer of roses,\" has uplifted a million  hearts from the \"base earth\" and \"black fog\" to the very throne of  God, and her mission is as yet but begun.    The pen of Soeur Therese herself must now take up the narrative.  It will do so in words that do not merely tell of love but set the  heart on fire, and at the same time lay bare the workings of God  in a soul that \"since the age of three never refused the Good God  anything.\" The writing of this Autobiography was an act of  obedience, and the Prioress who imposed the task sought, in all  simplicity, her own personal edification. But the fragrance of its  pages was such that she was advised to publish them to the world.  She did so in 1899 under the title of _L'Histoire d'une Ame._ An  English version by M. H. Dziewicki appeared in 1901.    This new translation relates more fully the story of the  childhood, girlhood, and brief convent days of Soeur Therese. It  tells of her \"Roses,\" and sets forth again, in our world-wide  tongue, her world-wide embassy--the ever ancient message of God's  Merciful Love, the ever new _way_ to Him of \"confidence and  self-surrender.\"    The Editor.  ______________________________    [1] The baptismal entry, with its numerous signatures, is shown to  visitors, and a tablet in the baptistry of the beautiful Gothic  church tells the pilgrim that here the \"Little Queen\" was made a  child of God.

When you asked me to write it, I feared the task might  unsettle me, but since then Our Lord has deigned to make me  understand that by simple obedience I shall please Him best. I  begin therefore to sing what must be my eternal song: \"the Mercies  of the Lord.\"[1]    Before setting about my task I knelt before the statue of Our Lady  which had given my family so many proofs of Our Heavenly Mother's  loving care.[2] As I knelt I begged of that dear Mother to guide  my hand, and thus ensure that only what was pleasing to her should  find place here.    Then opening the Gospels, my eyes fell on these words: \"Jesus,  going up into a mountain, called unto Him whom He would  Himself.\"[3]    They threw a clear light upon the mystery of my vocation and of my  entire life, and above all upon the favours which Our Lord has  granted to my soul. He does not call those who are worthy, but  those whom He will. As St. Paul says: \"God will have mercy on whom  He will have mercy.[4] So then it is not of him that willeth, nor  of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\"[5]    I often asked myself why God had preferences, why all souls did  not receive an equal measure of grace. I was filled with wonder  when I saw extraordinary favours showered on great sinners like  St. Paul, St. Augustine, St. Mary Magdalen, and many others, whom  He forced, so to speak, to receive His grace. In reading the lives  of the Saints I was surprised to see that there were certain  privileged souls, whom Our Lord favoured from the cradle to the  grave, allowing no obstacle in their path which might keep them  from mounting towards Him, permitting no sin to soil the spotless  brightness of their baptismal robe. And again it puzzled me why so  many poor savages should die without having even heard the name of  God.    Our Lord has deigned to explain this mystery to me. He showed me  the book of nature, and I understood that every flower created by  Him is beautiful, that the brilliance of the rose and the  whiteness of the lily do not lessen the perfume of the violet or  the sweet simplicity of the daisy. I understood that if all the  lowly flowers wished to be roses, nature would lose its springtide  beauty, and the fields would no longer be enamelled with lovely  hues. And so it is in the world of souls, Our Lord's living  garden. He has been pleased to create great Saints who may be  compared to the lily and the rose, but He has also created lesser  ones, who must be content to be daisies or simple violets  flowering at His Feet, and whose mission it is to gladden His  Divine Eyes when He deigns to look down on them. And the more  gladly they do His Will the greater is their perfection.    I understood this also, that God's Love is made manifest as well  in a simple soul which does not resist His grace as in one more  highly endowed. In fact, the characteristic of love being  self-abasement, if all souls resembled the holy Doctors who have  illuminated the Church, it seems that God in coming to them would  not stoop low enough. But He has created the little child, who  knows nothing and can but utter feeble cries, and the poor savage  who has only the natural law to guide him, and it is to their  hearts that He deigns to stoop. These are the field flowers whose  simplicity charms Him; and by His condescension to them Our"]]]
