[3] See the chapter _Molecular Architecture_ in the _Story of     the Chemical Elements_.    Lucretius pictured a solid substance as a vast number of atoms  squeezed closely together, a liquid as composed of not so many atoms  less tightly packed, and a gas as a comparatively small number of  atoms with considerable freedom of motion. Essentially the same  picture is presented by the molecular theory of to-day.    To meet the objection that atoms are invisible, and therefore cannot  exist, Lucretius enumerates many things we cannot see although we know  they exist. No one doubts the existence of winds, heat, cold and  smells; yet no one has seen the wind, or heat, or cold, or a smell.  Clothes become moist when hung near the sea, and dry when spread in  the sunshine; but no one has seen the moisture entering or leaving the  clothes. A pavement trodden by many feet is worn away; but the minute  particles are removed without our eyes being able to see them.    Another objector urges--\"You say the atoms are always moving, yet the  things we look at, which you assert to be vast numbers of moving  atoms, are often motionless.\" Him Lucretius answers by an analogy.  \"And herein you need not wonder at this, that though the  first-beginnings of things are all in motion, yet the sum is seen to  rest in supreme repose, unless when a thing exhibits motions with its  individual body. For all the nature of first things lies far away from  our senses, beneath their ken; and, therefore, since they are  themselves beyond what you can see, they must withdraw from sight  their motion as well; and the more so, that the things which we can  see do yet often conceal their motions when a great distance off.  Thus, often, the woolly flocks as they crop the glad pastures on a  hill, creep on whither the grass, jewelled with fresh dew, summons or  invites each, and the lambs, fed to the full, gambol and playfully  butt; all which objects appear to us from a distance to be blended  together, and to rest like a white spot on a green hill. Again, when  mighty legions fill with their movements all parts of the plains,  waging the mimicry of war, the glitter lifts itself up to the sky, and  the whole earth round gleams with brass, and beneath a noise is raised  by the mighty tramplings of men, and the mountains, stricken by the  shouting, echo the voices to the stars of heaven, and horsemen fly  about, and suddenly wheeling, scour across the middle of the plains,  shaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And yet there is some  spot on the high hills, seen from which they appear to stand still and  to rest on the plains as a bright spot.\"    The atomic theory of the Greek thinkers was constructed by reasoning  on natural phenomena. Lucretius constantly appeals to observed facts  for confirmation of his theoretical teachings, or refutation of  opinions he thought erroneous. Besides giving a general mental  presentation of the material universe, the theory was applied to many  specific transmutations; but minute descriptions of what are now  called chemical changes could not be given in terms of the theory,  because no searching examination of so much as one such change had  been made, nor, I think, one may say, could be made under the  conditions of Greek life. More than two thousand years passed before  investigators began to make accurate measurements of the quantities of  the substances which take part in those changes wherein certain  things seem to be destroyed and other totally different things to be  produced; until accurate knowledge had been obtained of the quantities  of the definite substances which interact in the transformations of  matter, the atomic theory could not do more than draw the outlines of  a picture of material changes.    A scientific theory has been described as \"the likening of our  imaginings to what we actually observe.\" So long as we observe only in  the rough, only in a broad and general way, our imaginings must also  be rough, broad, and general. It was the great glory of the Greek  thinkers about natural events that their observations were accurate,  on the whole, and as far as they went, and the theory they formed was  based on no trivial or accidental features of the facts, but on what  has proved to be the very essence of the phenomena they sought to  bring into one point of view; for all the advances made in our own  times in clear knowledge of the transformations of matter have been  made by using, as a guide to experimental inquiries, the conception  that the differences between the qualities of substances are connected  with differences in the weights and movements of minute particles; and  this was the central idea of the atomic theory of the Greek  philosophers.    The atomic theory was used by the great physicists of the later  Renaissance, by Galileo, Gassendi, Newton and others. Our own  countryman, John Dalton, while trying (in the early years of the 19th  century) to form a mental presentation of the atmosphere in terms of  the theory of atoms, rediscovered the possibility of differences  between the sizes of atoms, applied this idea to the facts concerning  the quantitative compositions of compounds which had been established  by others, developed a method for determining the relative weights of  atoms of different kinds, and started chemistry on the course which it  has followed so successfully.    Instead of blaming the Greek philosophers for lack of quantitatively  accurate experimental inquiry, we should rather be full of admiring  wonder at the extraordinary acuteness of their mental vision, and the  soundness of their scientific spirit.    The ancient atomists distinguished the essential properties of things  from their accidental features. The former cannot be removed,  Lucretius said, without \"utter destruction accompanying the  severance\"; the latter may be altered \"while the nature of the thing  remains unharmed.\" As examples of essential properties, Lucretius  mentions \"the weight of a stone, the heat of fire, the fluidity of  water.\" Such things as liberty, war, slavery, riches, poverty, and the  like, were accounted accidents. Time also was said to be an accident:  it \"exists not by itself; but simply from the things which happen, the  sense apprehends what has been done in time past, as well as what is  present, and what is to follow after.\"    As our story proceeds, we shall see that the chemists of the middle  ages, the alchemists, founded their theory of material changes on the  difference between a supposed essential substratum of things, and  their qualities which could be taken off, they said, and put on, as  clothes are removed and replaced.    How different from the clear, harmonious, orderly, Greek scheme, is  any picture we can form, from such quotations as I have given from  their writings, of the alchemists' conception of the world. The Greeks  likened their imaginings of nature to the natural facts they observed;  the alchemists created an imaginary world after their own likeness.    While Christianity was superseding the old religions, and the  theological system of the Christian Church was replacing the  cosmogonies of the heathen, the contrast between the power of evil and  the power of good was more fully realised than in the days of the  Greeks; a sharper division was drawn between this world and another  world, and that other world was divided into two irreconcilable and  absolutely opposite parts. Man came to be regarded as the centre of a  tremendous and never-ceasing battle, urged between the powers of good  and the powers of evil. The sights and sounds of nature were regarded  as the vestments, or the voices, of the unseen combatants. Life was at  once very real and the mere shadow of a dream. The conditions were  favourable to the growth of magic; for man was regarded as the measure  of the universe, the central figure in an awful tragedy.    Magic is an attempt, by thinking and speculating about what we  consider must be the order of nature, to discover some means of  penetrating into the secret life of natural things, of realising the  hidden powers and virtues of things, grasping the concealed thread of  unity which is supposed to run through all phenomena however seemingly  diverse, entering into sympathy with the supposed inner oneness of  life, death, the present, past, and future. Magic grows, and gathers  strength, when men are sure their theory of the universe must be the  one true theory, and they see only through the glasses which their  theory supplies. \"He who knows himself thoroughly knows God and all  the mysteries of His nature,\" says a modern writer on magic. That  saying expresses the fundamental hypothesis, and the method, of all  systems of magic and mysticism. Of such systems, alchemy was one.          CHAPTER II.    A SKETCH OF ALCHEMICAL THEORY.      The system which began to be called _alchemy_ in the 6th and 7th  centuries of our era had no special name before that time, but was  known as _the sacred art, the divine science, the occult science, the  art of Hermes_.    A commentator on Aristotle, writing in the 4th century A.D., calls  certain instruments used for fusion and calcination \"_chuika organa_,\"  that is, instruments for melting and pouring. Hence, probably, came  the adjective _chyic_ or _chymic_, and, at a somewhat later time, the  word _chemia_ as the name of that art which deals with calcinations,  fusions, meltings, and the like. The writer of a treatise on  astrology, in the 5th century, speaking of the influences of the stars  on the dispositions of man, says: \"If a man is born under Mercury he  will give himself to astronomy; if Mars, he will follow the profession  of arms; if Saturn, he will devote himself to the science of alchemy  (_Scientia alchemiae_).\" The word _alchemia_ which appears in this  treatise, was formed by prefixing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#3)"],[1," to count another failure. Lobo came trotting along the trail, and was  fairly between the parallel lines before he detected the single trap in  the trail, but he stopped in time, and why and how he knew enough I  cannot tell; the Angel of the wild things must have been with him, but  without turning an inch to the right or left, he slowly and cautiously  backed on his own tracks, putting each paw exactly in its old track  until he was off the dangerous ground. Then returning at one side he  scratched clods and stones with his hind feet till he had sprung every  trap. This he did on many other occasions, and although I varied my  methods and redoubled my precautions, he was never deceived, his  sagacity seemed never at fault, and he might have been pursuing his  career of rapine to-day, but for an unfortunate alliance that proved his  ruin and added his name to the long list of heroes who, unassailable  when alone, have fallen through the indiscretion of a trusted ally.    [Illustration: Lobo and Blanca.]          III      Once or twice, I had found indications that everything was not quite  right in the Currumpaw pack. There were signs of irregularity, I  thought; for instance there was clearly the trail of a smaller wolf  running ahead of the leader, at times, and this I could not understand  until a cowboy made a remark which explained the matter.    \"I saw them to-day,\" he said, \"and the wild one that breaks away is  Blanca.\" Then the truth dawned upon me, and I added, \"Now, I know that  Blanca is a she-wolf, because were a he-wolf to act thus, Lobo would  kill him at once.\"    This suggested a new plan. I killed a heifer, and set one or two rather  obvious traps about the carcass. Then cutting off the head, which is  considered useless offal, and quite beneath the notice of a wolf, I set  it a little apart and around it placed six powerful steel traps properly  deodorized and concealed with the utmost care. During my operations I  kept my hands, boots, and implements smeared with fresh blood, and  afterward sprinkled the ground with the same, as though it had flowed  from the head; and when the traps were buried in the dust I brushed the  place over with the skin of a coyote, and with a foot of the same animal  made a number of tracks over the traps. The head was so placed that  there was a narrow passage between it and some tussocks, and in this  passage I buried two of my best traps, fastening them to the head  itself.    Wolves have the habit of approaching every carcass they get the wind of,  in order to examine it, even when they have no intention of eating it,  and I hoped that this habit would bring the Currumpaw pack within reach  of my latest stratagem. I did not doubt that Lobo would detect my  handiwork about the meat, and prevent the pack approaching it, but I did  build some hopes on the head, for it looked as though it had been thrown  aside as useless.    Next morning, I sallied forth to inspect the traps, and there, oh, joy!  were the tracks of the pack, and the place where the beef-head and its  traps had been was empty. A hasty study of the trail showed that Lobo  had kept the pack from approaching the meat, but one, a small wolf, had  evidently gone on to examine the head as it lay apart and had walked  right into one of the traps.    We set out on the trail, and within a mile discovered that the hapless  wolf was Blanca. Away she went, however, at a gallop, and although  encumbered by the beef-head, which weighed over fifty pounds, she  speedily distanced my companion who was on foot. But we overtook her  when she reached the rocks, for the horns of the cow's head became  caught and held her fast. She was the handsomest wolf I had ever seen.  Her coat was in perfect condition and nearly white.    She turned to fight, and raising her voice in the rallying cry of her  race, sent a long howl rolling over the canon. From far away upon the  mesa came a deep response, the cry of Old Lobo. That was her last call,  for now we had closed in on her, and all her energy and breath were  devoted to combat.    Then followed the inevitable tragedy, the idea of which I shrank from  afterward more than at the time. We each threw a lasso over the neck of  the doomed wolf, and strained our horses in opposite directions until  the blood burst from her mouth, her eyes glazed, her limbs stiffened  and then fell limp. Homeward then we rode, carrying the dead wolf, and  exulting over this, the first death-blow we had been able to inflict on  the Currumpaw pack.    At intervals during the tragedy, and afterward as we rode homeward, we  heard the roar of Lobo as he wandered about on the distant mesas, where  he seemed to be searching for Blanca. He had never really deserted her,  but knowing that he could not save her, his deep-rooted dread of  firearms had been too much for him when he saw us approaching. All that  day we heard him wailing as he roamed in his quest, and I remarked at  length to one of the boys, \"Now, indeed, I truly know that Blanca was  his mate.\"    As evening fell he seemed to be coming toward the home canon, for his  voice sounded continually nearer. There was an unmistakable note of  sorrow in it now. It was no longer the loud, defiant howl, but a long,  plaintive wail: \"Blanca! Blanca!\" he seemed to call. And as night came  down, I noticed that he was not far from the place where we had  overtaken her. At length he seemed to find the trail, and when he came  to the spot where we had killed her, his heart-broken wailing was  piteous to hear. It was sadder than I could possibly have believed.  Even the stolid cowboys noticed it, and said they had \"never heard a  wolf carry on like that before.\" He seemed to know exactly what had  taken place, for her blood had stained the place of her death.    Then he took up the trail of the horses and followed it to the  ranch-house. Whether in hopes of finding her there, or in quest of  revenge, I know not, but the latter was what he found, for he surprised  our unfortunate watchdog outside and tore him to little bits within  fifty yards of the door. He evidently came alone this time, for I found  but one trail next morning, and he had galloped about in a reckless  manner that was very unusual with him. I had half expected this, and had  set a number of additional traps about the pasture. Afterward I found  that he had indeed fallen into one of these, but such was his strength,  he had torn himself loose and cast it aside.    I believed that he would continue in the neighborhood until he found her  body at least, so I concentrated all my energies on this one enterprise  of catching him before he left the region, and while yet in this  reckless mood. Then I realized what a mistake I had made in killing  Blanca, for by using her as a decoy I might have secured him the next  night.    I gathered in all the traps I could command, one hundred and thirty  strong steel wolf-traps, and set them in fours in every trail that led  into the canon; each trap was separately fastened to a log, and each log  was separately buried. In burying them, I carefully removed the sod and  every particle of earth that was lifted we put in blankets, so that  after the sod was replaced and all was finished the eye could detect no  trace of human handiwork. When the traps were concealed I trailed the  body of poor Blanca over each place, and made of it a drag that circled  all about the ranch, and finally I took off one of her paws and made  with it a line of tracks over each trap. Every precaution and device  known to me I used, and retired at a late hour to await the result.    Once during the night I thought I heard Old Lobo, but was not sure of  it. Next day I rode around, but darkness came on before I completed the  circuit of the north canon, and I had nothing to report. At supper one  of the cowboys said, \"There was a great row among the cattle in the  north canon this morning, maybe there is something in the traps there.\"  It was afternoon of the next day before I got to the place referred to,  and as I drew near a great grizzly form arose from the ground, vainly  endeavoring to escape, and there revealed before me stood Lobo, King of  the Currumpaw, firmly held in the traps. Poor old hero, he had never  ceased to search for his darling, and when he found the trail her body  had made he followed it recklessly, and so fell into the snare prepared  for him. There he lay in the iron grasp of all four traps, perfectly  helpless, and all around him were numerous tracks showing how the cattle  had gathered about him to insult the fallen despot, without daring to  approach within his reach. For two days and two nights he had lain  there, and now was worn out with struggling. Yet, when I went near him,  he rose up with bristling mane and raised his voice, and for the last  time made the canon reverberate with his deep bass roar, a call for  help, the muster call of his band. But there was none to answer him,  and, left alone in his extremity, he whirled about with all his strength  and made a desperate effort to get at me. All in vain, each trap was a  dead drag of over three hundred pounds, and in their relentless fourfold  grasp, with great steel jaws on every foot, and the heavy logs and  chains all entangled together, he was absolutely powerless. How his huge  ivory tusks did grind on those cruel chains, and when I ventured to  touch him with my rifle-barrel he left grooves on it which are there to  this day. His eyes glared green with hate and fury, and his jaws snapped  with a hollow 'chop,' as he vainly endeavored to reach me and my  trembling horse. But he was worn out with hunger and struggling and loss  of blood, and he soon sank exhausted to the ground.    Something like compunction came over me, as I prepared to deal out to  him that which so many had suffered at his hands.    \"Grand old outlaw, hero of a thousand lawless raids, in a few minutes  you will be but a"]]]
