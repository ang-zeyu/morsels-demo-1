What is in this flower?\"    \"O mother! it is a bee. I wonder how it came to be shut up in the flower!\"    \"It went into the flower for some honey, and it may be it went to sleep.  Then the flower shut it in.    \"The bee likes honey as well as we do, but it does not like to be shut up  in the flower.    \"Shall we let it out, Lucy?\"    \"Yes; then it can go to other flowers, and get honey.\"        LESSON XLI.    best    hitched    their    should     or      rid'ing    live    holds      hay      driv'ing   tight   ear'ly      [Illustration: One boy riding a horse, and another boy riding a cart  pulled by a horse.]      Here come Frank and James White. Do you know where they live?    Frank is riding a horse, and James is driving one hitched to a cart. They  are out very early in the day. How happy they are!    See how well Frank rides, and how tight James holds the lines!    The boys should be kind to their horses. It is not best to whip them.    When they have done riding, they will give the horses some hay or corn.      Slate Work    [Illustration: Script Exercise:    Some horses can trot very  fast. Would you like to ride  fast? One day I saw a dog  hitched up a little cart. The  cart had some corn in it.  ]        LESSON XLII.    look'ing    thought   pick'ing    heard    chirp    were    told    birds    search     dear'ly    young       girl     loved    chil'dren    be sides'      [Illustration: Girl picking flowers.]      A little girl went in search of flowers for her mother. It was early in  the day, and the grass was wet. Sweet little birds were singing all around  her.    And what do you think she found besides flowers? A nest with young birds  in it.    While she was looking at them, she heard the mother bird chirp, as if she  said, \"Do not touch my children, little girl, for I love them dearly.\"    The little girl now thought how dearly her own mother loved her.    So she left the birds. Then picking some flowers, she went home, and told  her mother what she had seen and heard.

Is this the fast train?\"    \"Yes, this is the lightning train.\"    \"Oh! that is too fast for me.\"    \"What shall we get for you in town, mamma?\"    \"A big basket, with two good little children in it.\"    \"All right!

Three are holding books,  others are playing with a ball.]      It is noon, and the school is out. Do you see the children at play? Some  run and jump, some play ball, and three little girls play school under a  tree.    What a big room for such a small school!    Mary is the teacher. They all have books in their hands, and Fanny is  reading.    They are all good girls, and would not be rude even in playing school.    Kate and Mary listen to Fanny as she reads from her book.    What do you think she is reading about? I will tell you. It is about a  poor little boy who was lost in the woods.    When Fanny has finished, the three girls will go home.    In a little while, too, the boys will give up their playing.

Parrot is on a perch  in the foreground.]      Lucy has a new pet. Do you know what kind of bird it is? Lucy calls her  Polly.    Polly can say, \"Poor Poll! Poor Poll! Polly wants a cracker;\" and she can  mew like a cat.    But Polly and the cat are not good friends. One day Polly flew down, and  lit upon the cat's back when she was asleep.    I think she knew the cat would not like that, and she did it to tease her.    When Lucy pets the cat, Polly flies up into the old apple tree, and will  not come when she calls her. Then Lucy says, \"What a silly bird!\"        LESSON XLVI. REVIEW.      \"Well, children, did you have a nice time in the woods?\"    \"Oh yes, mother, such a good time! See what sweet flowers we found, and  what soft moss. The best flowers are for grandma. Won't they please her?\"    \"Yes; and it will please grandma to know that you thought of her.\"      [Illustration: Dog sitting by picnic basket in woods. Two dolls are  lying next to the basket.]      \"Rab was such a good dog, mother.    We left him under the big tree by the brook, to take care of the dolls and  the basket.    \"When we came back, they were all safe. No one could get them while Rab  was there. We gave him some of the crackers from the basket.    \"O mother, how the birds did sing in the woods!    \"Fanny said she would like to be a bird, and have a nest in a tree. But I  think she would want to come home to sleep.\"    \"If she were a bird, her nest would be her home. But what would mother do,  I wonder, without her little Fanny?\"        LESSON XLVII.    beach    shells    these    seat        waves     go'ing    ev'er    sea       watch    e'ven ing   la'zy     side      [Illustration: Horses pulling family in wagon.]      These boys and girls live near the sea. They have been to the beach. It is  now evening, and they are going home.    John, who sits on the front seat, found some pretty shells. They are in  the basket by his side.    Ben White is driving. He holds the lines in one hand, and his whip in the  other.    Robert has his hat in his hand, and is looking at the horses. He thinks  they are very lazy; they do not trot fast.    The children are not far from home. In a little while the sun will set,  and it will be bedtime.    Have you ever been at the seaside? Is it not good sport to watch the big  waves, and to play on the wet sand?        LESSON XLVIII.    log    qui'et    proud    pulled    fish    stump    riv'er    fa'ther      [Illustration: Father and son fishing from under a tree.]      One evening Frank's father said to him, \"Frank, would you like to go with  me to catch some fish?\"    \"Yes; may I go? and with you, father?\"    \"Yes, Frank, with me.\"    \"Oh, how glad I am!\"    Here they are, on the bank of a river. Frank has just pulled a fine fish  out of the water. How proud he feels!    See what a nice, quiet spot they have found. Frank has the stump of a big  tree for his seat, and his father sits on a log near by. They like the  sport.
