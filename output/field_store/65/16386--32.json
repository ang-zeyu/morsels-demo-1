Then  you won't have the bother of digging 'em, you know,\" went on the  fun-loving boy innocently.    \"Absurd, Thomas! But I shall have some very large varieties, I feel  certain.\"    \"Big as a watermelon?\"    \"Hardly, but--\"    \"Big as a muskmelon, then?\"    \"Not exactly, but--\"    \"About the size of a cocoanut, eh?\"    \"No! no! They will be as large as--\"    \"I mean a little cocoanut,\" pleaded Tom, while Sam felt like laughing  outright.    \"Well, yes, a little cocoanut. You see--\"    \"We saw some big potatoes in California, Uncle Randolph.\"    \"Ah! Of what variety?\"    \"_Cornus bustabus_, or something like that. Sam, what was the name, do  you know?\"    \"That must be something like it, Tom,\" grinned the youngest Rover.    \"Took two men to lift some of those potatoes,\" went on Tom calmly.    \"Two men? Thomas, surely you are joking.\"    \"No, uncle, I am telling nothing but the strict truth.\"    \"But two men! The potatoes must have been of monstrous size!\"    \"Oh, not so very big. But they did weigh a good deal, no question of  it.\"    \"Think of two men lifting one potato!\"    \"I didn't say one potato, Uncle Randolph. I said some of those  potatoes.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"The men had a barrel full of 'em.\"    \"Thomas!\" The uncle shook his finger threateningly. \"At your old  tricks, I see. I might have known it.\" And then he stalked off to hide  his chagrin.    \"Tom, that was rather rough on Uncle Randolph,\" said Sam, after a  laugh.    \"So it was, Sam. But I've got to do something. This being boxed up,  when one might be fishing or swimming, or playing baseball, is simply  dreadful,\" answered the other.    Just before the evening meal was announced Jack Ness came up from the  barn, and sought out Randolph Rover.    \"Found a man slinking around the cow-shed a while ago,\" he said. \"He  looked like a tramp. I wanted to talk to him, but he scooted in  double-quick order.\"    \"Humph! We haven't had any tramps here in a long time,\" came from  Randolph Rover. \"Where did he go to?\"    \"Down toward the berry patch.\"    \"Did you follow him up?\"    \"I did, sir, but he got away from me.\"    \"You must keep a close watch for those fellows,\" said Randolph Rover  bluntly. \"I don't want any of them getting in our barn and burning it  down to the ground.\"    \"You are right, Randolph,\" said Anderson Rover. \"Make them keep away  from the place by all means, Jack.\"    \"I'll keep my eye peeled for 'em,\" answered the hired man.    The wind was now blowing a gale, causing the trees near the farmhouse  to creak and groan, and banging more than one shutter. But the boys did  not mind this, and went to bed promptly at the usual hour.    \"A storm like this on land is nothing to one on the sea,\" was the way  Tom expressed himself. \"I don't like anything better than to listen to  the whistling of the wind when I am snug in bed.\"    For the time being Sam and Tom were occupying a room in the L of the  farmhouse, and Dick had a small bedchamber adjoining. The boys were  soon undressed, and, having said their prayers, hopped into bed, and  were soon sound asleep.    It was not until half an hour later that the older folks retired.  Anderson Rover was the last to leave the sitting room, where he had  been busy writing some letters at the desk that stood there.    As he was about to retire he fancied he heard a noise outside of one of  the windows. He drew up the curtain and looked through the glass, but  could see nothing.    \"It must have been the wind,\" he murmured. \"But, somehow, it didn't  sound like it.\"    As he stepped into the dark hallway an uneasy feeling took possession  of him--a feeling hard to define, and one for which he could not  account.    \"I think I had better go around and see that all the doors and windows  are properly locked,\" he told himself. \"Brother Randolph may have  overlooked one of them.\"    He walked the length of the hallway, and stepped into the kitchen and  over to a side window.    As he had his hand on the window-latch he heard a quick step directly  behind him.    He started to turn, but before he could do so he received a blow on the  head from a club that staggered him. Then he was jerked backward to the  floor.    \"Silence!\" muttered a voice close to his ear. \"Don't you dare to make a  sound!\"    \"What does this mean--\" he managed to gasp.    \"Silence, I tell you!\" was the short answer. \"If you say another word,  I will hit you again!\"    Having no desire to receive a blow that might render him totally  unconscious, or, perhaps, take his life, Anderson Rover said no more.  He heard a match struck, and then a bit of a tallow candle was lit and  placed on the edge of the kitchen table.    By this dim light the father of the Rover boys saw standing over him a  tall man, beardless, and with his head closely cropped. One glance into  that hardened face sufficed to tell him who the unwelcome visitor was.    \"Arnold Baxter!\"    \"I see you recognize me,\" was the harsh reply. \"Not so loud, please,  unless you want that crack I promised you.\"    \"What brings you here, and at such an hour as this?\"    \"I find it more convenient to travel during the night than in the  daytime.\"    \"The police are on your track.\"    \"I know that as well you, Rover.\"    \"What do you want here?\"    \"What does any man want when he has been stripped of all his  belongings? I want money.\"    \"I have none for you.\"    \"Bosh! Do you think I have forgotten how you and your boys swindled me  out of my rights to that mine in the far West?\"    \"We did not swindle you, Baxter. The claim was lawfully mine.\"    \"I can't stop to argue the question, and I don't want you to talk so  loud, remember that. No, don't try to get up,\" went on the midnight  visitor, as Anderson Rover attempted to rise. \"Stay just where you  are.\"    He was feeling in his pocket, and now he brought forth a strip of  cloth, with a knot tied in the middle.    It was a gag, and he started to place it in Anderson Rover's mouth,  when the latter leaped up and began to struggle with all the force he  could command.    \"Stop, I tell you!\" cried Arnold Baxter softly.    \"Stop!\" And then, catching up his club once more, he dealt Anderson  Rover another blow, this time directly across the temple. The gentleman  wavered for an instant, gave a deep groan, and fell like a log to the  floor.          CHAPTER IV    A USELESS PURSUIT      Half an hour later Tom awoke with a start. For the moment he could not  tell what had aroused him. Then he remembered hearing the slam of a  door or a window sash.    \"Must have been the storm,\" he told himself, and was about to turn over  and go to sleep when he heard a gun-shot from the direction of the  barn.    \"Something is wrong, that's certain!\" he cried. \"Sam, wake up!\"    \"What's the row, Tom?\" questioned the youngest brother sleepily.    Before Tom could reply they heard Dick getting up, and also their Uncle  Randolph and Aunt Martha.    \"What did that shot mean?\" demanded Randolph Rover, coming toward the  boys' rooms. \"Did any of you fire it?\"    \"No, it came from outside,\" returned Torn. \"Hark!\"    \"Hullo, in the house!\" came in the voice of Jack Ness. \"Wake up,  everybody! Something is wrong!\"    After this it did not take long for those upstairs to slip into some  clothing, and go below. Randolph Rover ran to the side door, to find it  wide open. Dick lit the hall lamp.    \"Saw a man running across the garden,\" said Jack Ness, who had his  shot-gun with him. \"I yelled to him to stop, and then fired the gun. I  think he came from the house.\"    \"How did you happen to be up?\" asked Sam.    \"One of the horses is sick, and I was attending to him.\"    By this time some of the others were looking into the various rooms.    \"The desk has been broken open!\" cried Dick. \"And the pantry in the  corner, too!\"    \"Mercy, save us!\" shrieked Mrs. Rover, from the kitchen. \"Come here at  once. Poor Anderson has been killed!\"    \"Killed!\" gasped Tom; and then all ran to the kitchen as quickly as  they could.    They found Anderson Rover lying where he had fallen, and still  unconscious. There was a lump on his forehead, and a thin stream of  blood trickled down one side of his face.    \"Thank heaven, he is not dead!\" murmured Dick, as he knelt beside his  father. \"But he has been struck some cruel blows. Somebody fetch water  and a bandage.\"    The water was procured, and also a bandage, and under skillful  treatment, Anderson Rover was presently restored to consciousness.    \"Where--where is he?\" he questioned, when he could speak.    \"Do you mean the person who struck you down?\" asked Dick.    \"Ye--yes.\"    \"I don't know. Got away, I guess.\"    \"The villain! He attacked me most foully!\"    \"I saw him running across the garden,\" put in the hired man. \"Did he  steal anything?\"    \"To be sure he stole something,\" said Sam. \"He ransacked the whole  lower floor, by the looks of things.\"    \"Wonder who it was?\" put in Tom.    \"It was Arnold Baxter,\" answered his father.    \"Arnold Baxter!\" cried the others in chorus.    \"Are you certain?\" asked Dick.    \"Yes. He struck me down, and then lit the bit of tallow candle you see  lying there. Then we struggled, and he hit me again, and that is all I  know. But I am sure it was Baxter, for I spoke to him. He accused us of  having robbed him of that mine out West.\"    \"Was he alone?\" asked Randolph Rover.    \"I saw no one else.\"    \"We ought to follow him up,\" declared Tom, now that he realized his  father was not so badly hurt as at first feared.    \"That's the talk!\" ejaculated Dick. \"Wait till I get my pistol.\"    \"Boys, do keep out of harm,\" pleaded Mrs. Rover. \"Remember that this  Arnold Baxter is a desperate criminal.\"    \"We are not afraid of him,\" answered Tom.    \"We'll show him that he can't  come here and attack father,\" added Sam.    Leaving their father in the care of their Aunt Martha, the three Rover  boys armed themselves and sallied forth, accompanied by their uncle and  Alexander Pop, the latter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#3)"],[1,"and  social surroundings. If we find, for example, an abnormal development  of crime taking place in a given country at a certain period of life,  or in certain social circumstances, and if we do not discover the same  abnormal development taking place in other countries at a similar  period of life, or in a similar social stratum, we ought at once to  come to the conclusion that there is some extraordinary cause at work  peculiar to the country which is producing an unusually high total of  crime. If, on the other hand, we find that certain kinds of crime are  increasing or decreasing in all countries at the same time, we may be  perfectly sure that the increase or decrease is brought about by the  same set of causes. And whether those causes are war, political  movements, commercial prosperity, or depression, the community which  first escapes from them will also be the first to show it in the  annual statistics of crime. In these and many other ways international  statistics are of the greatest utility.    From what has already been said as to the immense difficulty of  comparing the criminal statistics of various countries, it follows as  a matter of course that the figures contained in them cannot be used  as a means of ascertaining the position which belongs to each nation  respectively in the scale of morality. Nor is the moral progress of a  nation to be measured solely by an apparent decay of crime. On the  contrary, an increase in the amount of crime may be the direct result  of a moral advance in the average sentiments of the community. The  passing of the Elementary Education Act of 1870 and of the Criminal  Law Amendment Act of 1885 have added considerably to the number of  persons brought before the criminal courts and eventually committed to  prison. But an increase of the prison population due to these causes  is no proof that the country is deteriorating morally. It will be  regarded by many persons as a proof that the country has improved, for  it is now demanding a higher standard of conduct from the ordinary  citizen than it demanded twenty years ago.[3]        [3] Before the passing of the Elementary Education Act, no one      was tried for not sending his child to school; it was not a legal      offence; in 1888-9 no less than 80,519 persons were tried under      this Act, in England and Wales.    On the other hand, a decrease in the official statistics of crime may  be a proof that the moral sentiments of a nation are degenerating. It  may be a proof that the laws are ceasing to be an effective protection  to the citizen, and that society is falling a victim to the forces of  anarchy and crime. It is, therefore, impossible by looking only at the  bare figures contained in criminal statistics, to say whether a  community is growing better or worse. Before any conclusions can be  formed on these matters, either one way or the other, we must go  behind the figures, and look at them in the light of the social,  political and industrial developments taking place in the society to  which these figures refer.    In this connection, it may not be amiss to point out that the present  tendency of legislation is bound to produce more crime. All law is by  its nature coercive, but so long as the coercion is confined within a  limited area, or can only come into operation at rare intervals, it  produces comparatively little effect on the whole volume of crime.  When, however, a law is passed affecting every member of the community  every day of his life, such a law is certain to increase the  population of our gaols. A marked characteristic of the present time  is that legislative assemblies are becoming more and more inclined to  pass such laws; so long as this is the case it is vain to hope for a  decrease in the annual amount of crime. Whether these new coercive  laws are beneficial or the reverse is a matter which it does not at  this moment concern me to discuss; what I am anxious to point out is,  that the more they are multiplied, the greater will be the number of  persons annually committed to prison. In initiating legislation of a  far-reaching coercive character, politicians should remember far more  than they do at present that the effect of these Acts of Parliament  will be to fill the gaols, and to put the prison taint upon a greater  number of the population. This is a responsibility which no body of  men ought lightly to incur, and in considering the advantages to be  derived from some new legislative enactment, an equal amount of  consideration should be bestowed upon the fact that the new enactment  will also be the means of providing a fresh recruiting ground for the  permanent army of crime.    A man, for instance, goes to prison for contravening some municipal  bye-law; he comes out of it the friend and associate of habitual  criminals; and the ultimate result of the bye-law is to transform a  comparatively harmless member of society into a dangerous thief or  house-breaker. One person of this character is a greater menace to  society than a hundred offenders against municipal regulations, and  the present system of law-making undoubtedly helps to multiply this  class of men. One of the leading principles of all wise legislation  should be to keep the population out of gaol; but the direct result of  many recent enactments, both in this country and abroad, is to drive  them into it; and it may be taken as an axiom that the more the  functions of Government are extended, the greater will be the amount  of crime.    These remarks lead me to approach the question of what is called \"the  movement\" of crime. Is its total volume increasing or decreasing in  the principal civilised countries of the world? On this point there is  some diversity of view, but most of the principal authorities in  Europe and America are emphatically of opinion that crime is on the  increase. In the United States, we are told by Mr. D.A. Wells,[4] and  by Mr. Howard Wines, an eminent specialist in criminal matters, that  crime is steadily increasing, and it is increasing faster than the  growth of the population.        [4] _Recent Economic Changes_, p. 345.    Nearly all the chief statisticians abroad tell the same tale with  respect to the growth of crime on the Continent. Dr. Mischler of  Vienna, and Professor von Liszt of Marburg draw a deplorable picture  of the increase of crime in Germany. Professor von Liszt, in a recent  article,[5] says, that fifteen million persons have been convicted by  the German criminal courts within the last ten years; and, according  to him, the outlook for the future is sombre in the last degree. In  France, the criminal problem is just as formidable and perplexing as  it is in Germany; M. Henri Joly estimates that crime has increased in  the former country 133 per cent. within the last half century, and is  still steadily rising. Taking Victoria as a typical Australasian  colony, we find that even in the Antipodes, which are not vexed to the  same extent as Europe with social and economic difficulties, crime is  persistently raising its head, and although it does not increase quite  as rapidly as the population, it is nevertheless a more menacing  danger among the Victorian colonists than it is at home.[6]        [5] _Zeitschrift fuer die gesamte Strafrechtswissenschaft_ ix.      472, sg.        [6] See _Statistical Register for Victoria_, Part viii.    Is England an exception to the rest of the world with respect to  crime? Many people are of opinion that it is, and the idea is at  present diligently fostered on the platform and in the press that we  have at last found out the secret of dealing successfully with the  criminal population. As far as I can ascertain, this belief is based  upon the statement that the daily average of persons in prison is  constantly going down. Inasmuch, as there was a daily average of over  20,000 persons in prison in 1878, and a daily average of about 15,000  in 1888, many people immediately jump at the conclusion that crime is  diminishing. But the daily average is no criterion whatever of the  rise and fall of crime. Calculated on the principle of daily average,  twelve men sentenced to prison for one month each, will not figure so  largely in criminal statistics as one man sentenced to a term of  eighteen months. The daily average, in other words, depends upon the  length of sentence prisoners receive, and not upon the number of  persons committed to prison, or upon the number of crimes committed  during the year. Let us look then at the number of persons committed  to Local Prisons, and we shall be in a position to judge if crime is  decreasing in England or not. We shall go back twenty years and take  the quinquennial totals as they are recorded in the judicial  statistics:--      Total of the 5 years, 1868 to 1872,    774,667.    Total of the 5 years, 1873 to 1877,    866,041.    Total of the 5 years, 1884 to 1888,    898,486.    If statistics are to be allowed any weight at all, these figures  incontestably mean that the total volume of crime is on the increase  in England as well as everywhere else. It is fallacious to suppose  that the authorities here are gaining the mastery over the delinquent  population. Such a supposition is at once refuted by the statistics  which have just been tabulated, and these are the only statistics  which can be implicitly relied upon for testing the position of the  country with regard to crime.    Seeing, then, that the total amount of crime is regularly growing,  how is the decrease in the daily average of persons in prison to be  accounted for?    This decrease may be accounted for in two ways. It may be shown that  although the number of people committed to prison is on the increase,  the nature of the offences for which these people are convicted is not  so grave. Or, in the second place, it may be shown that, although the  crimes committed now are equally serious with those committed twenty "]]]
