[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#3)"],[1," that which hath escaped you,  and set then yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty  Ocean, so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath stored  up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you....  Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the  breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be  quickened....    Beware not to deal unjustly with any one that appealeth to you, and  entereth beneath your shadow. Walk ye in the fear of God, and be ye of  them that lead a godly life. Rest not on your power, your armies, and  treasures. Put your whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created  you, and seek ye His help in all your affairs. Succour cometh from Him  alone. He succoureth whom He willeth with the hosts of the heavens and of  the earth.    Know ye that the poor are the trust of God in your midst. Watch that ye  betray not His trust, that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk  not in the ways of the treacherous. Ye will most certainly be called upon  to answer for His trust on the day when the Balance of Justice shall be  set, the day when unto every one shall be rendered his due, when the  doings of all men, be they rich or poor, shall be weighed.    If ye pay no heed unto the counsels which, in peerless and unequivocal  language, We have revealed in this Tablet, Divine chastisement shall  assail you from every direction, and the sentence of His justice shall be  pronounced against you. On that day ye shall have no power to resist Him,  and shall recognize your own impotence. Have mercy on yourselves and on  those beneath you, and judge ye between them according to the precepts  prescribed by God in His most holy and exalted Tablet, a Tablet wherein He  hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure, in which He  hath given, with distinctness, an explanation of all things, and which is  in itself a monition unto them that believe in Him.    Examine Our Cause, inquire into the things that have befallen Us, and  decide justly between Us and Our enemies, and be ye of them that act  equitably towards their neighbours. If ye stay not the hand of the  oppressor, if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, what  right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men? What is it of which ye  can rightly boast? Is it on your food and your drink that ye pride  yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on the diversity  and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves? If true glory  were to consist in the possession of such perishable things, then the  earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you, because it  supplieth you, and bestoweth upon you, these very things, by the decree of  the Almighty. In its bowels are contained, according to what God hath  ordained, all that ye possess. From it, as a sign of His mercy, ye derive  your riches. Behold then your state, the thing in which ye glory! Would  that ye could perceive it! Nay, By Him Who holdeth in His grasp the  kingdom of the entire creation! Nowhere doth your true and abiding glory  reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of God, your  wholehearted observance of His laws, your resolution to see that they do  not remain unenforced, and to pursue steadfastly the right course....    Twenty years have passed, O Kings, during which We have, each day, tasted  the agony of a fresh tribulation. No one of them that were before Us hath  endured the things We have endured. Would that ye could perceive it! They  that rose up against Us, have put Us to death, have shed Our blood, have  plundered Our property, and violated Our honour. Though aware of most of  Our afflictions, ye, nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the  aggressor. For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the  oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense  of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind?    God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the  people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of  the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers. If ye neglect the duty  prescribed unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered with  those of the unjust in His sight. Grievous, indeed, will be your error.  Cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised, and cast behind  your backs the commandments of God, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible,  the All-Compelling, the Almighty? Cast away the things ye possess, and  cling to that which God hath bidden you observe. Seek ye His grace, for he  that seeketh it treadeth His straight Path....    The day is approaching when God will have exalted His Cause and magnified  His testimony in the eyes of all who are in the heavens and all who are on  the earth. Place, in all circumstances, Thy whole trust in Thy Lord, and  fix Thy gaze upon Him, and turn away from all them that repudiate His  truth. Let God, Thy Lord, be Thy sufficing Succourer and Helper. We have  pledged Ourself to secure Thy triumph upon earth and to exalt Our Cause  above all men, though no king be found who would turn his face towards  Thee.          \"O KINGS of the earth! We see you increasing every year...\"      O KINGS of the earth! We see you increasing every year your expenditures,  and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This, verily, is wholly  and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and lay  not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not rob them to rear palaces for  yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for  yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you, if ye  but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your rule  violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver your wards to the hands of  the robber. By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by their aid ye  conquer. Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How strange, how very  strange!    Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this, the  Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition  and that of your dependents.    O Rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no  more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your territories and  dominions. Beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the  Faithful.    Be united, O Kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord  be stilled amongst you, and your people find rest, if ye be of them that  comprehend. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye  all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice.          \"THE one true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever regarded,...\"      THE one true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever regarded, and will  continue to regard, the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive  possession. All else, whether pertaining to land or sea, whether riches or  glory, He hath bequeathed unto the kings and rulers of the earth. From the  beginning that hath no beginning the ensign proclaiming the words 'He  doeth whatsoever He willeth' hath been unfurled in all its splendour  before His Manifestation. What mankind needeth in this day is obedience  unto them that are in authority, and a faithful adherence to the cord of  wisdom. The instruments which are essential to the immediate protection,  the security and assurance of the human race have been entrusted to the  hands, and lie in the grasp, of the governors of human society. This is  the wish of God and His decree.... We cherish the hope that one of the  kings of the earth will, for the sake of God, arise for the triumph of  this wronged, this oppressed people. Such a king will be eternally  extolled and glorified. God hath prescribed unto this people the duty of  aiding whosoever will aid them, of serving his best interests, and of  demonstrating to him their abiding loyalty. They who follow Me must  strive, under all circumstances, to promote the welfare of whosoever will  arise for the triumph of My Cause, and must at all times prove their  devotion and fidelity unto him. Happy is the man that hearkeneth and  observeth My counsel. Woe unto him that faileth to fulfil My wish.          NAPOLEON III      O KING of Paris! Tell the priest to ring the bells no longer. By God, the  True One! The Most Mighty Bell hath appeared in the form of Him Who is the  Most Great Name, and the fingers of the will of Thy Lord, the Most  Exalted, the Most High, toll it out in the heaven of Immortality, in His  name, the All-Glorious. Thus have the mighty verses of Thy Lord been again  sent down unto thee, that thou mayest arise to remember God, the Creator  of earth and heaven, in these days when all the tribes of the earth have  mourned, and the foundations of the cities have trembled, and the dust of  irreligion hath enwrapped all men, except such as God, the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise, was pleased to spare. Say: He Who is the Unconditioned is  come, in the clouds of light, that He may quicken all created things with  the breeze of His Name, the Most Merciful, and unify the world, and gather  all men around this Table which hath been sent down from heaven. Beware  that ye deny not the favour of God after it hath been sent down unto you.  Better is this for you than that which ye possess; for that which is yours  perisheth, whilst that which is with God endureth. He, in truth, ordaineth  what He pleaseth. Verily, the breezes of forgiveness have been wafted from  the direction of your Lord, the God of Mercy; whoso turneth thereunto,  shall be cleansed of his sins, and of all pain and sickness. Happy the man  that hath turned towards them, and woe betide him that hath turned aside.    Wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created things, thou wouldst  hear: 'The Ancient of Days is come in His great glory!'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16986"],[0,"The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys (#3)"],[1," the throne of \"Say,  all is from God,\"(33) and taketh his rest on the carpet of \"There is no  power or might but in God.\"(34) He looketh on all things with the eye of  oneness, and seeth the brilliant rays of the divine sun shining from the  dawning-point of Essence alike on all created things, and the lights of  singleness reflected over all creation.    It is clear to thine Eminence that all the variations which the wayfarer  in the stages of his journey beholdeth in the realms of being, proceed  from his own vision. We shall give an example of this, that its meaning  may become fully clear: Consider the visible sun; although it shineth with  one radiance upon all things, and at the behest of the King of  Manifestation bestoweth light on all creation, yet in each place it  becometh manifest and sheddeth its bounty according to the potentialities  of that place. For instance, in a mirror it reflecteth its own disk and  shape, and this is due to the sensitivity of the mirror; in a crystal it  maketh fire to appear, and in other things it showeth only the effect of  its shining, but not its full disk. And yet, through that effect, by the  command of the Creator, it traineth each thing according to the quality of  that thing, as thou observest.    In like manner, colors become visible in every object according to the  nature of that object. For instance, in a yellow globe, the rays shine  yellow; in a white the rays are white; and in a red, the red rays are  manifest. Then these variations are from the object, not from the shining  light. And if a place be shut away from the light, as by walls or a roof,  it will be entirely bereft of the splendor of the light, nor will the sun  shine thereon.    Thus it is that certain invalid souls have confined the lands of knowledge  within the wall of self and passion, and clouded them with ignorance and  blindness, and have been veiled from the light of the mystic sun and the  mysteries of the Eternal Beloved; they have strayed afar from the jewelled  wisdom of the lucid Faith of the Lord of Messengers, have been shut out of  the sanctuary of the All-Beauteous One, and banished from the Ka'bih(35)  of splendor. Such is the worth of the people of this age!    And if a nightingale(36) soar upward from the clay of self and dwell in  the rose bower of the heart, and in Arabian melodies and sweet Iranian  songs recount the mysteries of God--a single word of which quickeneth to  fresh, new life the bodies of the dead, and bestoweth the Holy Spirit upon  the moldering bones of this existence--thou wilt behold a thousand claws of  envy, a myriad beaks of rancor hunting after Him and with all their power  intent upon His death.    Yea, to the beetle a sweet fragrance seemeth foul, and to the man sick of  a rheum a pleasant perfume is as naught. Wherefore, it hath been said for  the guidance of the ignorant:      Cleanse thou the rheum from out thine head    And breathe the breath of God instead.(37)    In sum, the differences in objects have now been made plain. Thus when the  wayfarer gazeth only upon the place of appearance--that is, when he seeth  only the many-colored globes--he beholdeth yellow and red and white; hence  it is that conflict hath prevailed among the creatures, and a darksome  dust from limited souls hath hid the world. And some do gaze upon the  effulgence of the light; and some have drunk of the wine of oneness and  these see nothing but the sun itself.    Thus, for that they move on these three differing planes, the  understanding and the words of the wayfarers have differed; and hence the  sign of conflict doth continually appear on earth. For some there are who  dwell upon the plane of oneness and speak of that world, and some inhabit  the realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are  completely veiled. Thus do the ignorant people of the day, who have no  portion of the radiance of Divine Beauty, make certain claims, and in  every age and cycle inflict on the people of the sea of oneness what they  themselves deserve. \"Should God punish men for their perverse doings, He  would not leave on earth a moving thing! But to an appointed term doth He  respite them....\"(38)    O My Brother! A pure heart is as a mirror; cleanse it with the burnish of  love and severance from all save God, that the true sun may shine within  it and the eternal morning dawn. Then wilt thou clearly see the meaning of  \"Neither doth My earth nor My heaven contain Me, but the heart of My  faithful servant containeth Me.\"(39) And thou wilt take up thy life in  thine hand, and with infinite longing cast it before the new Beloved One.    Whensoever the light of Manifestation of the King of Oneness settleth upon  the throne of the heart and soul, His shining becometh visible in every  limb and member. At that time the mystery of the famed tradition gleameth  out of the darkness: \"A servant is drawn unto Me in prayer until I answer  him; and when I have answered him, I become the ear wherewith he  heareth....\" For thus the Master of the house hath appeared within His  home, and all the pillars of the dwelling are ashine with His light. And  the action and effect of the light are from the Light-Giver; so it is that  all move through Him and arise by His will. And this is that spring  whereof the near ones drink, as it is said: \"A fount whereof the near unto  God shall drink....\"(40)    However, let none construe these utterances to be anthropomorphism, nor  see in them the descent of the worlds of God into the grades of the  creatures; nor should they lead thine Eminence to such assumptions. For  God is, in His Essence, holy above ascent and descent, entrance and exit;  He hath through all eternity been free of the attributes of human  creatures, and ever will remain so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul  hath ever found the pathway to His Being. Every mystic knower hath  wandered far astray in the valley of the knowledge of Him; every saint  hath lost his way in seeking to comprehend His Essence. Sanctified is He  above the understanding of the wise; exalted is He above the knowledge of  the knowing! The way is barred and to seek it is impiety; His proof is His  signs; His being is His evidence.(41)    Wherefore, the lovers of the face of the Beloved have said: \"O Thou, the  One Whose Essence alone showeth the way to His Essence, and Who is  sanctified above any likeness to His creatures.\"(42) How can utter  nothingness gallop its steed in the field of preexistence, or a fleeting  shadow reach to the everlasting sun? The Friend(43) hath said, \"But for  Thee, we had not known Thee,\" and the Beloved(44) hath said, \"nor attained  Thy presence.\"    Yea, these mentionings that have been made of the grades of knowledge  relate to the knowledge of the Manifestations of that Sun of Reality,  which casteth Its light upon the Mirrors. And the splendor of that light  is in the hearts, yet it is hidden under the veilings of sense and the  conditions of this earth, even as a candle within a lantern of iron, and  only when the lantern is removed doth the light of the candle shine out.    In like manner, when thou strippest the wrappings of illusion from off  thine heart, the lights of oneness will be made manifest.    Then it is clear that even for the rays there is neither entrance nor  exit--how much less for that Essence of Being and that longed-for Mystery.  O My Brother, journey upon these planes in the spirit of search, not in  blind imitation. A true wayfarer will not be kept back by the bludgeon of  words nor debarred by the warning of allusions.      How shall a curtain part the lover and the loved one?    Not Alexander's wall can separate them!(45)    Secrets are many, but strangers are myriad. Volumes will not suffice to  hold the mystery of the Beloved One, nor can it be exhausted in these  pages, although it be no more than a word, no more than a sign. \"Knowledge  is a single point, but the ignorant have multiplied it.\"(46)    On this same basis, ponder likewise the differences among the worlds.  Although the divine worlds be never ending, yet some refer to them as  four: The world of time (zaman), which is the one that hath both a  beginning and an end; the world of duration (dahr), which hath a  beginning, but whose end is not revealed; the world of perpetuity  (sarmad), whose beginning is not to be seen but which is known to have an  end; and the world of eternity (azal), neither a beginning nor an end of  which is visible. Although there are many differing statements as to these  points, to recount them in detail would result in weariness. Thus, some  have said that the world of perpetuity hath neither beginning nor end, and  have named the world of eternity as the invisible, impregnable Empyrean.  Others have called these the worlds of the Heavenly Court (Lahut), of the  Empyrean Heaven (Jabarut), of the Kingdom of the Angels (Malakut), and of  the mortal world (Nasut).    The journeys in the pathway of love are reckoned as four: From the  creatures to the True One; from the True One to the creatures; from the  creatures to the creatures; from the True One to the True One.    There is many an utterance of the mystic seers and doctors of former times  which I have not mentioned here, since I mislike the copious citation from  sayings of the past; for quotation from the words of others proveth  acquired learning, not the divine bestowal. Even so much as We have quoted  here is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the  friends. Further, such matters are beyond the scope of this epistle. Our  unwillingness to recount their sayings is not from pride, rather is it a  manifestation of wisdom and a demonstration of grace.      If Khidr did wreck the vessel on the sea,    Yet in this wrong there are a thousand rights.(47)    Otherwise, this Servant regardeth Himself as utterly lost and as nothing,  even beside one of the beloved of God, how much"]]]
