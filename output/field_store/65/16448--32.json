Here a tam[/a]nuash song is meant by it, which, when sung by the  conjurer, will furnish him the certainty if his patient is a relapse  or not. There are several of these medicine-songs, but all of them  (n[/a]nuk h[^u]'k shu[=i]'sh) when consulted point out the spider-medicine  as the one to apply in this case. The spider's curing-instrument is  that small piece of buckskin (ub[/a]-ush) which has to be inserted under  the patient's skin. It is called the spider's medicine because the  spider-song is sung during its application.    585, 10. gut[:a]'ga.

NOTES.    No Klamath or Modoc sweat-lodge can be properly called a  sweat-_house_, as is the custom throughout the West. One kind of these  lodges, intended for the use of mourners only, are solid structures,  almost underground; three of them are now in existence, all believed  to be the gift of the principal national deity. Sudatories of the  other kind are found near every Indian lodge, and consist of a few  willow-rods stuck into the ground, both ends being bent over. The  process gone through while sweating is the same in both kinds of  lodges, with the only difference as to time. The ceremonies mentioned  4-13. all refer to sweating in the mourners' sweat-lodges. The  sudatories of the Oregonians have no analogy with the _estufas_ of  the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, as far as their construction is  concerned.    586, 1. l[/a]pa sp[^u]'klish, two sweat-lodges, stands for two _kinds_ of  sweat-lodges.    586, 5. shash[/a]moks=l[/o]latko forms _one_ compound word: one who,  or: those who have lost relatives by death; cf. pt[/i]sh=l[^u]lsh,  pg[/i]sh=l[^u]lsh; hishu[/a]kga pt[/i]sh=l[/u]latk, male orphan whose  father has died. In the same manner, [k=][)e]lek[/a]tko stands here as a  participle referring simultaneously to h[/i]shuaksh and to sn[/a]wedsh  w[/e]nuitk, and can be rendered by \"_bereaved_\". Shash[/a]moks, distr.  form of sh[/a]-amoks, is often pronounced shesh[/a]maks. T[/u]mi etc.  means, that many others accompany to the sweat-lodge, into which about  six persons can crowd themselves, bereaved husbands, wives or parents,  because the deceased were related to them.    586, 7. Shi[/u]lakiank etc. For developing steam the natives collect  only such stones for heating as are neither too large nor too small;  a medium size seeming most appropriate for concentrating the largest  amount of heat. The old sweat-lodges are surrounded with large  accumulations of stones which, to judge from their blackened exterior,  have served the purpose of generating steam; they weigh not over 3 to  5 pounds in the average, and in the vicinity travelers discover many  small cairns, not over four feet high, and others lying in ruins.  The shrubbery around the sudatory is in many localities tied up with  willow wisps and ropes.    586, 11. Spukli-u[/a]pka m[=a]'ntch means that the sweating-process is  repeated many times during the five days of observance; they sweat at  least twice a day.           *       *       *       *       *        A DOG'S REVENGE.

If he loved to share his time with her,  she loved to share her time with him alone, or with the beasts of the  field, or the birds of the air.  She watched her little flock late, and  she tended it early; not for the sordid love of the fleece, unless it was  to make mantles for her brother, but with the look of one who had joy in  its company.  The very wild creatures, the deer and the hares, seldom  sought to shun her approach, and the bird forsook not its nest, nor  stinted its song, when she drew nigh; such is the confidence which maiden  innocence and beauty inspire.    \"It happened one summer, about three years after they became orphans,  that rain had been for a while withheld from the earth, the hillsides  began to parch, the grass in the vales to wither, and the stream of  Corrie was diminished between its banks to the size of an ordinary rill.  The shepherds drove their flocks to moorlands, and marsh and tarn had  their reeds invaded by the scythe to supply the cattle with food.  The  sheep of his sister were Elphin's constant care; he drove them to the  moistest pastures during the day, and he often watched them at midnight,  when flocks, tempted by the sweet dewy grass, are known to browse  eagerly, that he might guard them from the fox, and lead them to the  choicest herbage.  In these nocturnal watchings he sometimes drove his  little flock over the water of Corrie, for the fords were hardly ankle-  deep; or permitted his sheep to cool themselves in the stream, and taste  the grass which grew along the brink.  All this time not a drop of rain  fell, nor did a cloud appear in the sky.    \"One evening, during her brother's absence with the flock, Phemie sat at  her cottage-door, listening to the bleatings of the distant folds and the  lessened murmur of the water of Corrie, now scarcely audible beyond its  banks.  Her eyes, weary with watching along the accustomed line of road  for the return of Elphin, were turned on the pool beside her, in which  the stars were glimmering fitful and faint.  As she looked she imagined  the water grew brighter and brighter; a wild illumination presently shone  upon the pool, and leaped from bank to bank, and suddenly changing into a  human form, ascended the margin, and, passing her, glided swiftly into  the cottage.  The visionary form was so like her brother in shape and  air, that, starting up, she flew into the house, with the hope of finding  him in his customary seat.  She found him not, and, impressed with the  terror which a wraith or apparition seldom fails to inspire, she uttered  a shriek so loud and so piercing as to be heard at Johnstone Bank, on the  other side of the vale of Corrie.\"    An old woman now rose suddenly from her seat in the window-sill, the  living dread of shepherds, for she travelled the country with a brilliant  reputation for witchcraft, and thus she broke in upon the narrative: \"I  vow, young man, ye tell us the truth upset and down-thrust.  I heard my  douce grandmother say that on the night when Elphin Irving  disappeared--disappeared I shall call it, for the bairn can but be gone  for a season, to return to us in his own appointed time--she was seated  at the fireside at Johnstone Bank; the laird had laid aside his bonnet to  take the Book, when a shriek mair loud, believe me, than a mere woman's  shriek--and they can shriek loud enough, else they're sair wranged--came  over the water of Corrie, so sharp and shrilling, that the pewter plates  dinneled on the wall; such a shriek, my douce grandmother said, as rang  in her ear till the hour of her death, and she lived till she was aughty-  and-aught, forty full ripe years after the event.  But there is another  matter, which, doubtless, I cannot compel ye to believe: it was the  common rumour that Elphin Irving came not into the world like the other  sinful creatures of the earth, but was one of the kane-bairns of the  fairies, whilk they had to pay to the enemy of man's salvation every  seventh year.  The poor lady-fairy--a mother's aye a mother, be she  elves' flesh or Eve's flesh--hid her elf son beside the christened flesh  in Marion Irving's cradle, and the auld enemy lost his prey for a time.  Now, hasten on with your story, which is not a bodle the waur for me.  The  maiden saw the shape of her brother, fell into a faint, or a trance, and  the neighbours came flocking in--gang on with your tale, young man, and  dinna be affronted because an auld woman helped ye wi 't.\"    \"It is hardly known,\" I resumed, \"how long Phemie Irving continued in a  state of insensibility.  The morning was far advanced, when a  neighbouring maiden found her seated in an old chair, as white as  monumental marble; her hair, about which she had always been solicitous,  loosened from its curls, and hanging disordered over her neck and bosom,  her hands and forehead.  The maiden touched the one, and kissed the  other; they were as cold as snow; and her eyes, wide open, were fixed on  her brother's empty chair, with the intensity of gaze of one who had  witnessed the appearance of a spirit.  She seemed insensible of any one's  presence, and sat fixed and still and motionless.  The maiden, alarmed at  her looks, thus addressed her:--'Phemie, lass, Phemie Irving!  Dear me,  but this be awful!  I have come to tell ye that seven of your pet sheep  have escaped drowning in the water; for Corrie, sae quiet and sae gentle  yestreen, is rolling and dashing frae bank to bank this morning.  Dear  me, woman, dinna let the loss of the world's gear bereave ye of your  senses.  I would rather make ye a present of a dozen mug-ewes of the  Tinwald brood myself; and now I think on 't, if ye'll send over Elphin, I  will help him hame with them in the gloaming myself.  So, Phemie, woman,  be comforted.'    \"At the mention of her brother's name she cried out, 'Where is he?  Oh,  where is he?' gazed wildly round, and, shuddering from head to foot, fell  senseless on the floor.  Other inhabitants of the valley, alarmed by the  sudden swell of the river, which had augmented to a torrent, deep and  impassable, now came in to inquire if any loss had been sustained, for  numbers of sheep and teds of hay had been observed floating down about  the dawn of the morning.  They assisted in reclaiming the unhappy maiden  from her swoon; but insensibility was joy compared to the sorrow to which  she awakened.  'They have ta'en him away, they have ta'en him away,' she  chanted, in a tone of delirious pathos; 'him that was whiter and fairer  than the lily on Lyddal Lee.  They have long sought, and they have long  sued, and they had the power to prevail against my prayers at last.  They  have ta'en him away; the flower is plucked from among the weeds, and the  dove is slain amid a flock of ravens.  They came with shout, and they  came with song, and they spread the charm, and they placed the spell, and  the baptised brow has been bowed down to the unbaptised hand.  They have  ta'en him away, they have ta'en him away; he was too lovely, and too  good, and too noble, to bless us with his continuance on earth; for what  are the sons of men compared to him?--the light of the moonbeam to the  morning sun, the glowworm to the eastern star.  They have ta'en him away,  the invisible dwellers of the earth.  I saw them come on him with  shouting and with singing, and they charmed him where he sat, and away  they bore him; and the horse he rode was never shod with iron, nor owned  before the mastery of human hand.  They have ta'en him away over the  water, and over the wood, and over the hill.  I got but ae look of his  bonnie blue ee, but ae; ae look.  But as I have endured what never maiden  endured, so will I undertake what never maiden undertook, I will win him  from them all.  I know the invisible ones of the earth; I have heard  their wild and wondrous music in the wild woods, and there shall a  christened maiden seek him, and achieve his deliverance.'  She paused,  and glancing around a circle of condoling faces, down which the tears  were dropping like rain, said, in a calm and altered but still delirious  tone: 'Why do you weep, Mary Halliday? and why do you weep, John Graeme?  Ye think that Elphin Irving--oh, it's a bonnie, bonnie name, and dear to  many a maiden's heart, as well as mine--ye think he is drowned in Corrie;  and ye will seek in the deep, deep pools for the bonnie, bonnie corse,  that ye may weep over it, as it lies in its last linen, and lay it, amid  weeping and wailing in the dowie kirkyard.  Ye may seek, but ye shall  never find; so leave me to trim up my hair, and prepare my dwelling, and  make myself ready to watch for the hour of his return to upper earth.'  And she resumed her household labours with an alacrity which lessened not  the sorrow of her friends.    \"Meanwhile the rumour flew over the vale that Elphin Irving was drowned  in Corriewater.  Matron and maid, old man and young, collected suddenly  along the banks of the river, which now began to subside to its natural  summer limits, and commenced their search; interrupted every now and then  by calling from side to side, and from pool to pool, and by exclamations  of sorrow for this misfortune.  The search was fruitless: five sheep,  pertaining to the flock which he conducted to pasture, were found drowned  in one of the deep eddies; but the river was still too brown, from the  soil of its moorland sources, to enable them to see what its deep  shelves, its pools, and its overhanging and hazelly banks concealed.  They  remitted further search till the stream should become pure; and old man  taking old man aside, began to whisper about the mystery of the youth's  disappearance; old women laid their lips to the ears of their coevals,  and talked of Elphin "]]]
