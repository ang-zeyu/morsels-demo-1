[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#3)"],[1,"took his first look at this latest victim  of mental or moral aberration. So young! so innocent! so fair! A  schoolgirl, or little more, of a class certainly above the average,  whether judged from the contour of her features or the niceties of her  dress. With no evidences of great wealth about her, there was yet  something in the cut of her garments and the careful attention to each  detail which bespoke not only natural but cultivated taste. On her breast  just above the spot where the cruel dart had entered, a fresh and  blooming nosegay still exhaled its perfume--a tragic detail accentuating  the pathos of a death so sudden that the joy with which she had pinned on  this simple adornment seemed to linger about her yet.    The detective, with no words for this touching spectacle, stretched out  his hand and with a reverent and fatherly touch pressed down the lids  over the unseeing eyes. This office done to the innocent dead, he asked  if anything had been found to establish the young girl's identity.    \"Surely,\" he observed, \"she was not without a purse or handbag. All young  ladies carry them.\"    For answer the officer on guard thrust his hand into one of his capacious  pockets, and drawing out a neat little bag of knitted beads, passed it  over to the detective with the laconic remark:    \"Nothing doing.\"    And so it proved. It held only a pocket handkerchief--embroidered but  without a monogram--and a memorandum-book without an entry.    \"A blind alley, if ever there was one,\" muttered Mr. Gryce; and ordering  the policeman to replace the bag as nearly as possible on the spot from  which it had been taken, he proceeded with the Curator to Room B.    Prepared to encounter a woman of disordered mind, the appearance  presented by Mrs. Taylor at his entrance greatly astonished Mr. Gryce.  There was a calmness in her attitude which one would scarcely expect to  see in a woman whom mania had just driven into crime. Surely lunacy does  not show such self-restraint; nor does lunacy awaken any such feelings of  awe as followed a prolonged scrutiny of her set but determined features.  Only grief of the most intense and sacred character could account for the  aspect she presented, and as the man to whom the tragedies of life were  of daily occurrence took in this mystery with all its incongruities, he  realized, not without a sense of professional pleasure, no doubt, that he  had before him an affair calling for the old-time judgment which, for  forty or more years, had made his record famous in the police annals of  the metropolis.    She was seated with no one near her but a young lady whom sympathetic  interest had drawn to her side. Mr. Roberts stood in one of the windows,  and not far from him a man in the museum uniform.    At the authoritative advance of the old detective, the woman, whose eye  he had caught, attempted to struggle to her feet, but desisted after a  moment of hopeless effort, and sank back in her chair. There was no  pretense in this. Though gifted with a strong frame, emotion had so  weakened her that she was simply unable to stand. Quite convinced of  this, and affected in spite of himself by her look of lofty patience, Mr.  Gryce prefaced his questions with an apology--quite an unusual proceeding  for him.    Whether or no she heard it, he could not tell; but she was quite ready to  answer when he asked her name and then her place of residence--saying in  response to the latter query:    \"I live at the Calderon, a family hotel in Sixty-seventh Street.  My name\"--here she paused for a second to moisten her lips--\"is  Taylor--Ermentrude Taylor.... Nothing else,\" she speedily added in  a tone which drew every eye her way. Then more evenly: \"You will find  the name on the hotel's books.\"    \"Wife or widow?\"    \"Widow.\"    What a voice! how it reached every heart, waking strange sympathies  there! As the word fell, not a person in the room but stirred uneasily.  Even she herself started at its sound; and moved, perhaps, by the depth  of silence which followed, she added in suppressed tones:    \"A widow within the hour. That's why you see me still in colors, but  crushed as you behold--killed! killed!\"    That settled it. There was no mistaking her condition after an expression  of this kind. The Curator and Mr. Gryce exchanged glances, and Mr.  Roberts, stepping from his corner, betrayed the effect which her words  had produced on him, by whispering in the detective's ear:    \"What you need is an alienist.\"    Had she heard? It would seem so from the quick way she roused and  exclaimed with indignant emphasis:    \"You do not understand me! I see that I must drink my bitter cup to the  dregs. This is what I mean: My husband was living this morning--living  up to the hour when the clock in this building struck twelve. I knew it  from the joyous hopes with which my breast was filled. But with the  stroke of noon the blow fell. I was bending above the poor child who had  fallen so suddenly at my feet, when the vision came, and I saw him gazing  at me from a distance so remote--across a desert so immeasurable--that  nothing but death could create such a removal or make of him the ghastly  silhouette I saw. He is dead. At that moment I felt his soul pass; and so  I say that I am a widow.\"    Ravings? No, the calm certainty of her tone, the grief, touching depths  so profound it had no need of words, showed the confidence she felt in  the warning she believed herself to have received. Though probably not  a single person present put any faith in occultism in any of its forms,  there was a general movement of sympathy which led Mr. Gryce to pass the  matter by without any attempt at controversy, and return to the question  in hand. With a decided modification of manner, he therefore asked her to  relate how she came to be kneeling over the injured girl with her hand  upon the arrow.    \"Let me have a moment in which to recover myself,\" she prayed, covering  her eyes with her hand. Then, while all waited, she gave a low cry, \"I  suffer; I suffer!\" and leaped to her feet, only to sink back again inert  and powerless. But only for an instant: with that one burst of extreme  feeling she recovered her self-control, answering with apparent calmness  the detective's question:    \"I was passing through the gallery as any other visitor might, when a  young lady rushed by me--stopped short--threw up her arms and fell  backward to the floor, pierced to the heart by an arrow. In a moment  I was on my knees at her side with hand outstretched to withdraw this  dreadful arrow. But I was afraid--I had heard that this sometimes causes  death, and while I was hesitating, that vision came, engulfing  everything. I could think of nothing else.\"    She was near collapsing again; but being a woman of great nerve, she  fought her weakness and waited patiently for the next question. It was  different, without doubt, from any she had expected.    \"Then you positively deny any active connection with the strange death of  this young girl?\"    A pause, as if to take in what he meant. Then slowly, impressively, came  the answer:    \"I do.\"    \"Did you see the person who shot the arrow?\"    \"No.\"    \"From what direction would it have had to come to strike her as it did?\"    \"From the opposite balcony.\"    \"Did you see anyone there?\"    \"No.\"    \"But you heard the arrow?\"    \"Heard?\"    \"An arrow shot from a bow makes a whizzing sound as it flies. Didn't you  hear that?\"    \"I don't know.\" She looked troubled and uncertain. \"I don't remember. I  was expecting no such thing--I was not prepared. The sight of an arrow--a  killing arrow--in that innocent breast overcame me with inexpressible  grief and horror. If the vision of my husband had not followed, I might  remember more. As it is, I have told all I can. Won't you excuse me? I  should like to go. I am not fit to remain. I want to return home--to  hear from my husband--to learn by letter or telegram whether he is indeed  dead.\"    Mr. Gryce had let her finish. An inquiry so unofficial might easily await  the moods of such a witness. Not till the last word had been followed by  what some there afterward called a hungry silence, did he make use of his  prerogative to say:    \"I shall be pleased to release you and will do so just as soon as I can.  But I must put one or two more questions. Were you interested in the  Indian relics you had come among? Did you handle any of them in passing?\"    \"No. I had no interest. I like glass, bronzes, china--I hate weapons. I  shall hate them eternally after this.\" And she began to shudder.    The detective, with a quick bend of his head, approached her ear with the  whispered remark:    \"I am told that when your attention was drawn to these weapons, you fell  on your knees and murmured something into the dead girl's ears. How do  you explain that?\"    \"I was giving her messages to my husband. I felt--strange as it may seem  to you--that they had fled the earth together--and I wanted him to know  that I would be constant, and other foolish things you will not wish me  to repeat here. Is that all you wish to know?\"    Mr. Gryce bowed, and cast a quizzical glance in the direction of the  Curator. Certainly for oddity this case transcended any he had had in  years. With this woman eliminated from the situation, what explanation  was there of the curious death he was there to investigate? As he was  meditating how he could best convey to her the necessity of detaining  her further, he heard a muttered exclamation from the young woman  standing near her, and following the direction of her pointing finger,  saw that the strange silence which had fallen upon the room had a cause.  Mrs. Taylor had fainted away in her chair.          III    \"I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU\"      Mr. Gryce took advantage of the momentary disturbance to slip from the  room. He was followed by the Curator, who seemed more than ever anxious  to talk.    \"You see! Mad as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#3)"],[1," sunk many, and drove others ashore all around our  coasts, even round the north of Scotland and Ireland.    \"You will see it all here, boys, and as you know, the price is only one  penny.\"    By this time, the sergeant had let down one side of the box and  discovered four round holes, and had arranged a low stool in front, for  any of those, who were not tall enough to look through the glasses, to  stand upon. A considerable number of girls and boys had now gathered  round, for Sergeant Wilks and his show were old, established favourites  at Sidmouth, and the news of his arrival had travelled quickly round  the place.    Four years before, he had appeared there for the first time, and since  then had come every few months. He travelled round the southwestern  counties, Dorset and Wilts, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, and his  cheery good temper made him a general favourite wherever he went.    He was somewhat of a martinet, and would have no crowding and pushing,  and always made the boys stand aside till the girls had a good look;  but he never hurried them, and allowed each an ample time to see the  pictures, which were of a better class than those in most travelling  peep shows. There was some murmuring, at first, because the show  contained none of the popular murders and blood-curdling scenes to  which the people were accustomed.    \"No,\" the sergeant had said firmly, when the omission was suggested to  him; \"the young ones see quite enough scenes of drunkenness and  fighting. When I was a child, I remember seeing in a peep show the  picture of a woman lying with her head nearly cut off, and her husband  with a bloody chopper standing beside her; and it spoiled my sleep for  weeks. No, none of that sort of thing for Sergeant Wilks. He has fought  for his country, and has seen bloodshed enough in his time, and the  ground half covered with dead and dying men; but that was duty--this is  pleasure. Sergeant Wilks will show the boys and girls, who pay him  their pennies, views in all parts of the world, such as would cost them  thousands of pounds if they travelled to see them, and all as natural  as life. He will show them great battles by land and sea, where the  soldiers and sailors shed their blood like water in the service of  their country. But cruel murders and notorious crimes he will not show  them.\"    It was not the boys and girls, only, who were the sergeant's patrons.  Picture books were scarce in those days, and grown-up girls and young  men were not ashamed to pay their pennies to peep into the sergeant's  box.    There was scarcely a farm house throughout his beat where he was not  known and welcomed. His care of the child, who, when he first came  round, was but a year old, won the heart of the women; and a bowl of  bread and milk for the little one, and a mug of beer and a hunch of  bread and bacon for himself, were always at his service, before he  opened his box and showed its wonders to the maids and children of the  house.    Sidmouth was one of his regular halting places, and, indeed, he visited  it more often than any other town on his beat. There was always a room  ready for him there, in the house of a fisherman's widow, when he  arrived on the Saturday, and he generally stopped till the Monday. Thus  he had come to know the names of most of the boys of the place, as well  as of many of the elders; for it was his custom, of a Saturday evening,  after the little one was in bed, to go and smoke his pipe in the  taproom of the \"Anchor,\" where he would sometimes relate tales of his  adventures to the assembled fishermen. But, although chatty and cheery  with his patrons, Sergeant Wilks was a reticent, rather than a  talkative, man. At the \"Anchor\" he was, except when called upon for a  story, a listener rather than a talker.    As to his history, or the county to which he belonged, he never alluded  to it, although communicative enough as to his military adventures; and  any questions which were asked him, he quietly put on one side. He had  intimated, indeed, that the father and mother of his grandchild were  both dead; but it was not known whether she was the child of his son or  daughter; for under his cheerful talk there was something of military  strictness and sternness, and he was not a man of whom idle questions  would be asked.    \"Now, boys and girls,\" he said, \"step up; the show is ready. Those who  have got a penny cannot spend it better. Those who haven't must try and  get their father or mother to give them one, and see the show later on.  Girls first. Boys should always give way to their sisters. The bravest  men are always the most courteous and gentle with women.\"    Four girls, of various ages, paid their pennies and took their places  at the glasses, and the sergeant then began to describe the pictures,  his descriptions of the wonders within being so exciting, that several  boys and girls stole off from the little crowd, and made their way to  their homes to coax their parents out of the necessary coin.    James Walsham listened a while, and then walked away to the sea, for  there would be several sets of girls before it came to the turn of the  boys. He strolled along, and as he came within sight of the beach  stopped for a moment suddenly, and then, with a shout, ran forward at  the top of his speed.    The little girl, after playing some time with the seaweed, had climbed  into a small boat which lay at the edge of the advancing tide, and,  leaning over the stern, watched the little waves as they ran up one  after another. A few minutes after she had got into it, the rising tide  floated the boat, and it drifted out a few yards, as far as its  headrope allowed it. Ignorant of what had happened, the child was  kneeling up at the stern, leaning over, and dabbling her hands in the  water.    No one had noticed her. The boys had all deserted the beach. None of  the fishermen were near the spot.    Just before James Walsham came within sight of the sea, the child had  overbalanced itself. His eye fell on the water just as two arms and a  frightened little face appeared above it. There was a little splash,  and a struggle, and the sea was bare again.    At the top of his speed James dashed across the road, sprang down the  beach, and, rushing a few yards into the water, dived down. He knew  which way the tide was making, and allowed for the set. A few vigorous  strokes, and he reached something white on the surface. It was the  sunbonnet which had, in the child's struggles, become unfastened. He  dived at once, and almost immediately saw a confused mass before him.  Another stroke, and he seized the child's clothes, and, grasping her  firmly, rose to the surface and swam towards shore.    Although the accident had not been perceived, his shout and sudden rush  into the water had called the attention of some of the men, and two or  three of them ran into the water, waist deep, to help him out with his  little burden.    \"Well done, Master Walsham! The child would have been drowned if you  had not seed it. None of us noticed her fall over. She was playing on  the beach last time I seed her.\"    \"Is she dead?\" James asked, breathless from his exertions.    \"Not she,\" the fisherman said. \"She could not have been under water a  minute. Take her into my cottage, it's one of the nighest. My wife will  put her between the blankets, and will soon bring her round.\"    The fisherman's wife met them at the door, and, taking the child from  the lad, carried it in, and soon had her wrapped up in blankets. But  before this was done she had opened her eyes, for she had scarcely lost  consciousness when James had seized her.    The lad stood outside the door, waiting for the news, when the sergeant  hurried up, one of the fishermen having gone to tell him what had  happened, as soon as the child had been carried into the  cottage--assuring him, as he did so, that the little one would speedily  come round.    Just as he came up the door of the cottage opened, and one of the  women, who had run in to assist the fisherman's wife, put her head out.    \"She has opened her eyes,\" she said. \"The little dear will soon be all  right.\"    \"Thank God for His mercies!\" the sergeant said, taking off his hat.  \"What should I have done if I had lost her?    \"And I have to thank you, next to God,\" he said, seizing the boy's  hand. \"May God bless you, young gentleman! and reward you for having  saved my darling. They tell me she must have been drowned, but for you,  for no one knew she had fallen in. Had it not been for you, I should  come round to look for her, and she would have been gone--gone  forever!\" and the showman dashed the tears from his eyes with the back  of his hand.    \"I was only just in time,\" the lad said. \"I did not see her fall out of  the boat. She was only a few yards away from it when she came up--just  as my eyes fell on the spot. I am very glad to have saved her for you;  but, of course, it was nothing of a swim. She could not have been many  yards out of my depth. Now I will run home and change my things.\"    James Walsham was too much accustomed to be wet through, to care  anything about his dripping clothes, but they served him as an excuse  to get away, for he felt awkward and embarrassed at the gratitude of  the old soldier. He pushed his way through the little crowd, which had  now gathered round, and started at a run; for the news had brought  almost all those gathered round the peep show to the shore, the  excitement of somebody being drowned being superior even to that of the  peep show, to the great majority; though a few, who had no hope of  obtaining the necessary pennies, had lingered behind, and seized the  opportunity for a gratuitous look through the glasses.    James ran upstairs and changed his clothes without seeing his mother,  and then, taking down one of his lesson books, set to work, shrinking  from the idea of going out again, and being made a hero of.
