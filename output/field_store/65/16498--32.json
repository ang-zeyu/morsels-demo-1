The great expedition to Persia, and the graphic description of the  retreat of the \"ten thousand\" Greeks, given by Xenophon in his Anabasis,  must have been well known to Alexander the Great when he set out on his  career of conquest. He overthrew the Persian empire in 331 B.C., having  destroyed Tyre and subdued Egypt in the previous year and carried his  triumphant progress to the banks of the Indus, and there he \"held  intercourse with the learned sages of India.\" On Alexander's death  Seleucus succeeded to the throne of Persia in 307 B.C., and not long  after he forced his way beyond the Indus, and ultimately as far as the  sacred river Ganges. He formed an alliance with the Indian king  Sandrocottus (otherwise known as Chandra-gupta), which was maintained  for many years, and it is said, also, that he gave his daughter in  marriage to the Indian king, and aided him with Grecian auxiliaries in  his wars.    He sent an expedition by sea, under the command of Patrocles his  admiral, who visited the western shores of India, and a little later he  despatched an embassy under Megasthenes and Onesicrates, the former of  whom resided for some years at the \"great city\" of Palibothra (supposed  to be Patna).    Not long after Megasthenes was at Palibothra, Ptolemy Philadelphus sent  an expedition overland through Persia to India, and later Ptolemy  Euergetes, who lived between 145-116 B.C., sent a fleet under Eudoxius  on a voyage of discovery to the western shores of India, piloted, as is  said, by an Indian sailor who had been shipwrecked, and who had been  found in a boat on the Red Sea. Eudoxius reached India safely, and  returned to Egypt with a cargo of spices and precious stones.    The proof of very ancient communication between Greece and India is  quite clear, both by way of Persia and Egypt, and we find that the  Greeks, who were in the habit of calling all other nations barbarians,  speak constantly with respect of the gymnosophists--called \"Sapientes  Indi\" by Pliny. We read also of the Greek philosophers constantly  travelling eastward in search of knowledge, and on their return setting  up new schools of thought. Thales, it is affirmed, travelled in Egypt  and Asia during the sixth century B.C., and it is said of him that he  returned to Miletus, and transported that vast stock of learning which  he had acquired into his own country.    He is generally considered as the first of the Greek philosophers.  Strabo says of him that he was the first of the Grecian philosophers who  made inquiry into natural causes and the mathematics.    The doctrine of Thales, that water was the first elementary principle,  is exactly that of the ancient Hindoos, who held that water was the  first element, and the first work of the creative power. This idea was  not completely exploded even up till the 18th century. We find Van  Helmont affirming that all metals, and even rocks, may be resolved into  water; and Lavoisier, so lately as 1770, thought it worth while to  communicate an elaborate paper \"On the nature of water and the  experiments by which it has been attempted to prove the possibility of  converting it into earth.\"    Pythagoras, perhaps the greatest of all Greek philosophers, it is known,  travelled very widely, spending no less than twenty-two years in Egypt.  He also spent some considerable time at Babylon, and was taught the lore  of the Magi.    In the famous satire of Lucian on the philosophic quackery of his day  (about 120 A.D.), \"The Sale of the Philosophers,\" we have a most  interesting account of the system of Pythagoras.    _Scene--A Slave Mart. _Jupiter_, _Mercury_, _philosophers_, in the garb  of slaves, for sale. Audience of buyers._    _Jupiter._--Now, you arrange the benches, and get the place ready for  the company. You bring out the goods and set them in a row; but trim  them up a little first, and make them look their best, to attract as  many customers as possible. You, Mercury, must put up the lots, and bid  all comers welcome to the sale. Gentlemen,--We are here going to offer  you philosophical systems of all kinds, and of the most varied and  ingenious description. If any gentleman happens to be short of ready  money he can give his security for the amount, and pay next year.    _Mercury (to Jupiter)._--There are a great many come; so we had best  begin at once, and not keep them waiting.    _Jupiter._--Begin the sale, then.    _Mercury._--Whom shall we put up first?    _Jupiter._--This fellow with the long hair--the Ionian. He's rather an  imposing personage.    _Mercury._--You, Pythagoras, step out, and show yourself to the company.    _Jupiter._--Put him up.    _Mercury._--Gentlemen, we here offer you a professor of the very best  and most select description. Who buys? Who wants to be a cut above the  rest of the world? Who wants to understand the harmonies of the universe  and to live two lives?    _Customer (turning the philosopher round and examining him)._--He's not  bad to look at. What does he know best?    _Mercury._--Arithmetic, astronomy, prognostics, geometry, music, and  conjuring. You've a first-rate soothsayer before you.    _Customer._--May one ask him a few questions?    _Mercury._--Certainly--(_aside_), and much good may the answers do you.    _Customer._--What country do you come from?    _Pythagoras._--Samos.    _Customer._--Where were you educated?    _Pythagoras._--In Egypt, among the wise men there.    _Customer._--Suppose I buy you, now, what will you teach me?    _Pythagoras._--I will teach you nothing--only recall things to your  memory.    _Customer._--How will you do that?    _Pythagoras._--First, I will clean out your mind, and wash out all the  rubbish.    _Customer._--Well, suppose that done, how do you proceed to refresh the  memory?    _Pythagoras._--First, by long repose and silence, speaking no word for  five whole years.    _Customer._--Why, look ye, my good fellow, you'd best go teach the dumb  son of Croesus! I want to talk and not be a dummy. Well--but after this  silence, and these five years?    _Pythagoras._--You shall learn music and geometry.    _Customer._--A queer idea, that one must be a fiddler before one can be  a wise man!    _Pythagoras._--Then you shall learn the science of numbers.    _Customer._--Thank you, but I know how to count already.    _Pythagoras._--How do you count?    _Customer._--One, two, three, four----    _Pythagoras._--Ha! what you call four is ten, and the perfect triangle,  and the great oath by which we swear.    _Customer._--Now, so help me, the great ten and four, I never heard more  divine or more wonderful words!    _Pythagoras._--And afterwards, stranger, you shall learn about Earth,  and Air, and Water, and Fire--what is their action, and what their form,  and what their motion.    _Customer._--What! have Fire, Air, or Water bodily shape?    _Pythagoras._--Surely they have; else, without form and shape, how could  they move! Besides, you shall learn that the Deity consists in Number,  Mind, and Harmony.    _Customer._--What you say is really wonderful.    _Pythagoras._--Besides what I have just told you, you shall understand  that you yourself, who seem to be one individual, are really somebody  else.    _Customer._--What! do you mean to say I'm somebody else, and not myself,  now talking to you?    _Pythagoras._--Just at this moment you are; but once upon a time you  appeared in another body, and under another name; and hereafter you will  pass again into another shape still.    (After a little more discussion of this philosopher's tenets, he is  purchased on behalf of a company of professors from Magna Graeca for ten  minae. The next lot is Diogenes, the Cynic.)    Apuleius says in the Florida, Section XV., in reference to Pythagoras,  that he went to Egypt to acquire learning, \"that he was there taught by  the priests the incredible power of ceremonies, the wonderful  commutations of numbers, and the most ingenious figures of geometry; but  that, not satisfied with these mental accomplishments, he afterwards  visited the Chaldaeans and the Brahmins, and amongst the latter the  Gymnosophists. The Chaldaeans taught him the stars, the definite orbits  of the planets, and the various effects of both kinds of stars upon the  nativity of men, as also, for much money, _the remedies for human use  derived from the earth, the air, and the sea_ (the elements earth, air,  and water, or all nature).    \"But the Brahmins taught him the greater part of his philosophy--what  are the rules and principles of the understanding; what the functions of  the body; how many the faculties of the soul; how many the mutations of  life; what torments or rewards devolve upon the souls of the dead,  according to their respective deserts.\"    There is ample evidence, therefore, that the Greeks had communication  with, and borrowed the philosophy of, both Persia and India at a very  early date.    That there was intimate intercourse with India in very ancient times  there can be no doubt. In addition to the classical sources of  information collected chiefly by the officers of Alexander the Great,  Seleucus and the Ptolemies, and which was condensed and reduced to  consistent shape by Diodorus, Strabo, Pliny, and Arrian, within the  first century before and the first century after Christ, we have the  further proof of the fact by the constant finds of innumerable Greek  coins over a large portion of north-western India, and even at Cabul.  These, so far as yet known, commence with the third of the Seleucidae,  and run on for many centuries, the inscriptions showing that the Greek  characters were used in the provinces of Cabul and the Punjab even so  late as the fourth century A.D."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#3)"],[1,"its force. I consider it more  immoveable than a rock, because by dint of time you may cut that away,  or you may blast it with gunpowder; but I know of no means which can  soften the adamantine strength of national prejudice. One might  naturally suppose that a long communication between the two countries, a  mutual interchange of kindnesses, the number of intermarriages by which  the two nations have become so connected with each other, would have  contributed in some degree to diminish the asperity of that bitter  feeling against the French which we acquire in our school-boy days, but  which reason and commerce with the world, it might be expected, would  correct. As there is no argument so powerful as exemplification, I will  here cite two instances amongst the hundreds that have come within my  knowledge, of the extreme incorrigibility of the baneful sentiment to  which I allude. I once travelled with a Mr. Lewis from Paris to Dieppe,  and found him a man of considerable information, very gentlemanly in his  address and manners, and possessing such colloquial powers as  contributed to render the journey particularly agreeable; he was an  enthusiastic admirer of the arts, and was very fond of drawing, and  certainly excelled in that accomplishment, from the very beautiful  sketches he showed me which he had made in different parts of France,  and in fact was an amateur artist of considerable merit. He gave me a  very interesting account of his tour through France and of the kindness  he had met with from the inhabitants; that in many instances when he had  been sketching the chateaux of the nobility and gentry, how often it had  occurred that the proprietors had come out and invited him to breakfast  or dinner, according to the hour, or at any rate to take some  refreshment; and several sent for his portemanteau from the inn where he  had put up (sometimes without his knowledge), compelling him to pass the  night at their chateau. On my making some remark as to the urbanity of  the French, \"Oh! don't think,\" he exclaimed, \"that I am praising them as  a nation, for I hate them; I only speak of facts as they happened.\" I  then asked him how he was treated at the inns in the different  provinces, and whether he was much imposed upon. \"I cannot say I was,\"  he replied, \"or in any instance that I had reason to complain of my  treatment.\"    From this gentleman's account of the reception he had met with in  France, would not any rational being have imagined that he would speak  well of the French? instead of which, I soon had the most powerful  proofs to the contrary. When we arrived at Dieppe we found a party  assembled at the _table d'hote_, at the _hotel_ at which we alighted,  consisting of a few French but, more of English; the former left the  room as soon as the cloth was withdrawn, and the latter remaining, the  conversation became general and very patriotic; and as the merits of  England and the English rose in the discussion, so did the demerits of  France and the French sink, and at last bumpers were drank to old  England for ever, in which we all joyously joined. This was all very  natural and proper, but this ebullition of national and praiseworthy  feeling had hardly subsided, when Mr. Lewis, the very man who had  admitted that he had been received with kindness and hospitality  wherever he had been in France, arose, and said, \"Now, gentlemen, I have  another toast to propose to you, which I hope will be drank with the  same enthusiasm as the last; so \"Here's a curse for France and the  French.\" All immediately drank it but myself and an elderly gentleman,  who declared he would not invoke a curse upon any land or any people. A  silent pause intervened; every one appeared to look at the other, as to  how they ought to act on their toast being refused, none caring to  assume the initiative. At last, one rising from his chair, who perhaps  began to view the affair temperately, observed, \"Well, I think we had  better see about the packet-boat for Brighton before it is too late,\"  and they all quitted the room, except the elderly gentlemen and myself,  and he did certainly animadvert most severely against what he termed  their unchristianlike toast. Although it was impossible for me, feeling  as I did, otherwise than to agree with him on the principal points of  his argument, yet I observed that we might hope that it was merely in  words that the gentlemen would evince the violence of their prejudices,  as I felt convinced, from the general amiability of character so  apparent in the person who proposed the toast, that if he saw a  Frenchman in danger of his life, and that an exertion could save him,  that Mr. Lewis would use every effort to preserve a human being from  destruction, whatever might be his country.    The other circumstance to which I am about to advert was less his  surprising, though equally powerful, in illustrating the strong tendency  towards prejudice against the French on the part of the English people,  the hero of my tale being a regular country squire, extremely kind  hearted, but whose fund of information did not extend much beyond his  estate, his horses and his hounds; not any consideration would have  induced him to quit England, but that of saving the life of an  individual, for whom, however worthless and ungrateful, he still  retained a sentiment of pity; a young man, whom he had brought up and  educated, in return for his kindness forged his name, and the evidence  of the squire was all that was requisite to hang him, therefore, as an  effectual means of avoiding to be forced to appear against him, he  quitted England; and, as France was the nearest, he there took up his  abode. A friend of mine, a Capt. W., who had resided long in France,  received a letter of introduction to the squire; although living at a  considerable distance from his residence, he took an opportunity of  presenting it. Having heard that the captain had been in France many  years, the Squire was not disposed to receive him very cordially,  considering that so doing was disgraceful on the part of an Englishman  unless he was forced to do so by circumstances such as had compelled  himself to quit his native country. The consequence was, that he eyed  the Captain in a manner that was far from flattering to his feelings;  but when he had read the highly recommendatory panegyric contained  within the letter, the Squire softened, and soon greeted the stranger  with a true hearty English welcome, and their respective families  afterwards became most intimately acquainted: the Squire, delighted to  find a countryman to whom he could communicate his execrations against  France and the French, whilst the Captain did all in his power to defend  them from all unjust attacks, having himself had favourable experience  of their urbanity and kindness. Some time after the Squire's arrival  the Captain removed to Boulogne, and as some grand ceremony was to be  there celebrated with military and ecclesiastical pomp and parade, in  the presence of the royal family, he invited the Squire and his family  to pass a few days with him, that they might witness so grand a  spectacle; adding, that there would be twenty thousand troops assembled  for the purpose. The Squire immediately flew into a violent passion, and  vowed he would accept the invitation on no other terms than that he  could take with him thirty thousand Englishman to cut their rascally  French throats. At length he gave his consent that his daughter should  pass a few days with the family of Capt. W., and at the same time  accompany them, to see the ceremony which was to take place. Partaking  of her father's feelings, all the way on the road she launched out  abusing every thing that was French and in fact all that she encountered  until the moment that she witnessed the imposing spectacle. She was then  standing within the church with the Captain amongst the crowd, but some  officers perceiving an English lady of genteel appearance, invited her  to join the circle composed of the Duchesses of Angouleme, of Berri, and  the ladies of the court, which she gladly accepted; and several fine  looking young men in their brilliant uniforms paying her the greatest  attentions, and taking the utmost pains that she should have the best  possible view of the sight, her heart was completely won, and when she  was re-conducted to Capt. W., her first exclamation was, \"Well, as long  as I live, I never will speak against Frenchmen again; for I never was  treated with so much politeness and attention in my own country as I  have been here.\" But when she expressed the same feeling to her father,  his rage knew no bounds, and at the first moment he swore he would take  her off to England instanter, adding \"I suppose I shall have my family  disgraced by your running off with some French mustachioed scoundrel or  another.\" The poor girl dared not say another word, and in a little time  the father recovered his equanimity.    However furious the Squire was in expressions against the French, yet  his actions towards them were of a contrary bearing, having a well  stocked medicine chest, from which he liberally dispensed the contents  amongst the neighbouring poor, according to their different maladies,  until he received the cognomen of the English doctor who would never  take a fee. The people at last became so grateful for his kindness, that  when there was a report that war was likely to take place between the  two countries, as he displayed some uneasiness as to his being able to  return home, they assured him he should always be certain of cattle to  convey him to Calais, as, if he could not procure post horses, they  would find some in the neighbourhood for him, and if none could be  found, they would draw him themselves to the spot he desired. After  residing a few years in France, the Squire returned to his own country,  little enlightened by his trip, cursing"]]]
