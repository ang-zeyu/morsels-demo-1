[Illustration]        There was a Young Lady of Clare,      Who was madly pursued by a Bear;      When she found she was tired, she abruptly expired,      That unfortunate Lady of Clare.    [Illustration]        There was a Young Lady of Dorking,      Who bought a large bonnet for walking;      But its color and size so bedazzled her eyes,      That she very soon went back to Dorking.    [Illustration]        There was an Old Man of Cape Horn,      Who wished he had never been born;      So he sat on a Chair till he died of despair,      That dolorous Man of Cape Horn.

[Illustration]        There was an Old Man who said, \"Well!      Will _nobody_ answer this bell?

[Illustration]        There was a Young Lady whose bonnet      Came untied when the birds sate upon it;      But she said, \"I don't care! all the birds in the air      Are welcome to sit on my bonnet!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#3)"],[1,"        And they all sang a song.                           II.       \"O Shovely so lovely!\" the Poker he sang,       \"You have perfectly conquered my heart.      Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! If you're pleased with my song,        I will feed you with cold apple-tart.      When you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,        You enrapture my life with delight,      Your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,        And your shape is so slender and bright!          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          Ain't you pleased with my song?\"                           III.       \"Alas! Mrs. Broom,\" sighed the Tongs in his song,       \"Oh! is it because I'm so thin,      And my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--        That you don't care about me a pin?      Ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,        Ah! why don't you heed my complaint?      Must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful Broom,        Because you are covered with paint?          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          You are certainly wrong.\"                           IV.        Mrs. Broom and Miss Shovel together they sang,       \"What nonsense you're singing to-day!\"      Said the Shovel, \"I'll certainly hit you a bang!\"        Said the Broom, \"And I'll sweep you away!\"      So the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,        Perceiving their anger with pain;      But they put on the kettle, and little by little        They all became happy again.          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          There's an end of my song.          THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR.    [Illustration]                         I.        Said the Table to the Chair,      \"You can hardly be aware      How I suffer from the heat      And from chilblains on my feet.      If we took a little walk,      We might have a little talk;      Pray let us take the air,\"      Said the Table to the Chair.                           II.        Said the Chair unto the Table,      \"Now, you _know_ we are not able:      How foolishly you talk,      When you know we _cannot_ walk!\"      Said the Table with a sigh,      \"It can do no harm to try.      I've as many legs as you:      Why can't we walk on two?\"                           III.        So they both went slowly down,      And walked about the town      With a cheerful bumpy sound      As they toddled round and round;      And everybody cried,      As they hastened to their side,      \"See! the Table and the Chair      Have come out to take the air!\"                           IV.        But in going down an alley,      To a castle in a valley,      They completely lost their way,      And wandered all the day;      Till, to see them safely back,      They paid a Ducky-quack,      And a Beetle, and a Mouse,      Who took them to their house.                  [Illustration]                           V.        Then they whispered to each other,      \"O delightful little brother,      What a lovely walk we've taken!      Let us dine on beans and bacon.\"      So the Ducky and the leetle      Browny-Mousy and the Beetle      Dined, and danced upon their heads      Till they toddled to their beds.

Once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose  names were    [Illustration]    VIOLET, SLINGSBY, GUY, and LIONEL;  and they all thought they should like to see the world. So they bought a  large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come  back on the other side by land. The boat was painted blue with green spots,  and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only  took a small Cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly  Quangle-Wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which  purposes they took a large kettle.    [Illustration]    For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat,  as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea  with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle instantly cooked them; and the  Pussy-Cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased,  on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.    During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water  into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope  that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the  evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to  sleep very comfortably, while Pussy and the Quangle-Wangle managed the  boat.    [Illustration]    After a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it,  they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth.  Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great  gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful,  and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.    When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great  surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and  chocolate-drops, and nothing else. So they all climbed up the single high  tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having  remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they  naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when  they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a  million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more  than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost  delight and apathy.    [Illustration]    After this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five  great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all  fast asleep. And I am sorry to say that the Pussy-Cat and the  Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the  sixty-five parrots; for which Violet reproved them both severely.    [Illustration]    Notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two  hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a  lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    [Illustration]    The next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which  was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so  they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the  fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with  shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. And as the few fishes  who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty  they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the  arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood  in great numbers, Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for  several of the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them;  through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    [Illustration]    Then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense  orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. So they all landed,  taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges,  and place them in it. But, while they were busy about this, a most  dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers  from Violet's bonnet. That, however, was nothing compared with the calamity  of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which  thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they  were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the  sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and  amazing nature.    [Illustration]    Nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and  hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had  to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    [Illustration]    This event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they  might never have become less so, had not Lionel, with a most praiseworthy  devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to  them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so  extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that  whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial  to Lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest  token of their sincere and grateful infection.    [Illustration]    After sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another  country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless  multitude of white Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle,  slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite  demeanor.    [Illustration]    And as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating  nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as  to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their pudding in a humble  and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than  gratified. It was agreed, therefore, that Guy should go and ask the Mice,  which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell  only half full of custard diluted with water. Now, this displeased Guy, who  said, \"Out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, I must say, you might  have spared a somewhat larger quantity.\" But no sooner had he finished  speaking than the Mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an  appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more  scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous  sneezing of many millions of angry Mice);"]]]
