Evening Devotions    When you go to bed in the evening, you should bless yourself with the  sign of the Holy Cross and say:  May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be done!  Amen.  Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's Prayer.  If you wish, then you may pray this little prayer as well:  My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your beloved  Son, that You have protected me, by Your grace. Forgive, I pray, all my  sins and the evil I have done. Protect me, by Your grace, tonight. I  put myself in your care, body and soul and all that I have. Let Your  holy angels be with me, so that the evil enemy will not gain power over  me. Amen.    After this, go to sleep immediately with joy.    Appendix II  How a Father Should Teach His Household  to say Grace and Return Thanks at Meals:    The Blessing    The children and servants should come to the table modestly and with  folded hands and say:  All eyes look to you, O Lord, and You give everyone food at the right  time. You open Your generous hands and satisfy the hunger of all living  things with what they desire. (Psalm 145:15-16)  Note: \"What they desire\" means that all animals get so much to eat,  that they are happy and cheerful. Because, worry and greed interferes  with such desires.  After this, pray the Lord's Prayer and the following prayer:  Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these gifts, which we receive  from Your generous hand, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.    Thanking God    After eating, too, they should modestly fold their hands and say:    Thank the Lord, because He is kind and His goodness lasts forever! He  gives all creatures food. He gives livestock their food and feeds the  young ravens that call out to Him. A horse's strength does not give Him  pleasure. A man's legs do not give Him joy. People who fear the Lord  and who wait for His goodness please Him.    After this, pray the Lord's Prayer and the following prayer:  We thank You, Lord God, Father, through Jesus Christ our Lord, for all  Your blessings. You live and rule forever! Amen!
