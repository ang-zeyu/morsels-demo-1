The Venetian fleet had  performed such marvels of valour, that, in the days when military  service was almost the sole avenue to distinction and fortune, the  desire to take part in a naval expedition, which promised unusual  opportunities of gaining credit and renown, was the most natural thing  possible for a boy of spirit.    Francis was a well built lad of nearly sixteen. He had, until he left  London when about twelve years old, taken his full share in the rough  sports which formed so good a training for the youths of England, and  in which the citizens of London were in no way behind the rest of the  kingdom. He had practised shooting with a light bow and arrows, in  company with boys of his own age, in the fields outside the city walls;  had engaged in many a rough tussle with light clubs and quarterstaffs;  and his whole time--except for an hour or two daily which he had, as  the son of a well to do citizen, spent in learning to read and  write--had been occupied in games and exercises of one kind or other.    Since his arrival in Venice he had not altogether discontinued his  former habits. At his earnest solicitation, his father had permitted  him to attend the School of Arms, where the sons of patricians and  well-to-do merchants learned the use of sword and dagger, to hurl the  javelin, and wield the mace and battleaxe; and was, besides, a  frequenter of some of the schools where old soldiers gave private  lessons in arms to such as could afford it; and the skill and strength  of the English lad excited no slight envy among the young Venetian  nobles. Often, too, he would go out to one of the sandy islets, and  there setting up a mark, practise with the bow. His muscles too, had  gained strength and hardness by rowing. It was his constant habit of an  evening, when well away from the crowded canals in the gondola, with  Giuseppi, the son and assistant of his father's gondolier, to take an  oar, for he had thoroughly mastered the difficult accomplishment of  rowing well in a gondola; but he only did this when far out from the  city, or when the darkness of evening would prevent his figure from  being recognized by any of his acquaintances, for no Venetian of good  family would demean himself by handling an oar. Francis, however,  accustomed to row upon the Thames, could see no reason why he should  not do the same in a gondola, and in time he and his companion could  send the boat dancing over the water, at a rate which enabled them to  overtake and distance most pair-oared boats.    After breakfast next morning he went down to the steps, where Beppo and  Giuseppi, in their black cloth suits with red sashes round their  waists, were waiting with the gondola in which Mr. Hammond was going  out to Malamocco, to examine a cargo which had the day before arrived  from Azoph. Giuseppi jumped ashore.    \"I have heard of just the gondola to suit you, Messer Francisco, and  you can get her a bargain.\"    \"What is she like, Giuseppi?\"    \"She belongs to a man out at Lido. She was built for the race two years  ago, but her owner fell sick and was unable to start. He has not got  strong again, and wants to sell his boat, which is far too light for  ordinary work. They say she is almost like an eggshell, and you and I  will be able to send her along grandly. She cost four ducats, but he  will sell her for two.\"    \"That is capital, Giuseppi. This gondola is all well enough for my  father, but she is very heavy. This evening we will row over to Lido  and look at her.\"    A few minutes later Mr. Hammond came down. Beppo and his son took off  their jackets, and in their snow white shirts and black trousers, set  off by the red scarf and a red ribbon round their broad hats, took  their places on the bow and stern. Mr. Hammond sat down on the cushions  in the middle of the boat, and with an easy, noiseless motion the  gondola glided away from the stairs. Francis, with a little sigh,  turned away and strolled off for a couple of hours' work with the  preceptor, with whom he had continued his studies since he came to  Venice.    This work consisted chiefly of learning various languages, for in those  days there was little else to learn. Latin was almost universally  spoken by educated men in southern Europe, and Greeks, Italians,  Spaniards, and Frenchmen were able to converse in this common medium.  French Francis understood, for it was the language in use in the court  and among the upper classes in England. Italian he picked up naturally  during his residence, and spoke it with the facility of a native. He  could now converse freely in Latin, and had some knowledge of German.  At the same school were many lads of good Venetian families, and it was  here that he had first made the acquaintance of Matteo Giustiniani, who  was now his most intimate friend.    Matteo, like all the young nobles of Venice, was anxious to excel in  military exercises, but he had none of the ardour for really hard work  which distinguished his friend. He admired the latter's strength and  activity, but could not bring himself to imitate him, in the exercises  by which that strength was attained, and had often remonstrated with  him upon his fondness for rowing.    \"It is not seemly, Francisco, for a gentleman to be labouring like a  common gondolier. These men are paid for doing it; but what pleasure  there can be in standing up working that oar, till you are drenched  with perspiration, I cannot understand. I don't mind getting hot in the  School of Arms, because one cannot learn to use the sword and dagger  without it, but that's quite another thing from tugging at an oar.\"    \"But I like it, Matteo; and see how strong it has made my muscles, not  of the arm only, but the leg and back. You often say you envy me my  strength, but you might be just as strong if you chose to work as I do.  Besides, it is delightful, when you are accustomed to it, to feel the  gondola flying away under your stroke.\"    \"I prefer feeling it fly away under some one else's stroke, Francisco.  That is pleasant enough, I grant; but the very thought of working as  you do throws me into a perspiration. I should like to be as strong as  you are, but to work as a gondolier is too high a price to pay for it.\"    That evening, Francis crossed the lagoon in the gondola with Giuseppi,  to inspect the boat he had heard of. It was just what he wanted. In  appearance it differed in no way from an ordinary gondola, but it was a  mere shell. The timbers and planking were extremely light, and the  weight of the boat was little more than a third of that of other craft.  She had been built like a working gondola, instead of in the form of  those mostly used for racing, because her owner had intended, after the  race was over, to plank her inside and strengthen her for everyday  work. But the race had never come off, and the boat lay just as she had  come from the hands of her builder, except that she had been painted  black, like other gondolas, to prevent her planks from opening. When  her owner had determined to part with her he had given her a fresh coat  of paint, and had put her in the water, that her seams might close up.    \"I don't like parting with her,\" the young fisherman to whom she  belonged said. \"I tried her once or twice, and she went like the wind,  but I got fever in my bones and I am unlikely to race again, and the  times are hard, and I must part with her.\"    Francis and Giuseppi gave her a trial, and were delighted with the  speed and ease with which she flew through the water. On their return  Francis at once paid the price asked for her. His father made him a  handsome allowance, in order that he might be able to mix, without  discomfort, with the lads of good family whom he met at his preceptor's  and at the schools of arms. But Francis did not care for strolling in  the Piazza, or sitting for hours sipping liquors. Still less did he  care for dress or finery. Consequently he had always plenty of money to  indulge in his own special fancies.    As soon as the bargain was completed, Giuseppi took his place in the  old gondola, while Francis took the oar in his new acquisition, and  found to his satisfaction that with scarcely an effort he could dart  ahead of his companion and leave him far behind. By nightfall the two  gondolas were fastened, side by side, behind the gaily painted posts  which, in almost all Venetian houses, are driven into the canal close  to the steps, and behind which the gondolas belonging to the house lie  safe from injury by passing craft.    \"I have bought another gondola, father,\" Francis said the next morning.  \"She is a very light, fast craft, and I got her cheap.\"    \"I don't see what you wanted another gondola for, Francis. I do not use  mine very much, and you are always welcome to take it when I do not  want it.\"    \"Yes, father, but you often use it in the evening, and that is just the  time when one wants to go out. You very often only take Beppo with you,  when you do not go on business, and I often want a boat that I could  take with Giuseppi. Besides, your gondola is a very solid one, and I  like passing people.\"    \"Young people always want to go fast,\" Mr. Hammond said. \"Why, I can't  make out. However, Francis, I am not sorry that you have got a boat of  your own, for it has happened several times lately, that when in the  evening I have gone down intending to row round to the Piazzetta, I  have found the boat gone, and have had to walk. Now I shall be able to  rely on finding Beppo asleep in the boat at the steps. In future, since  you have a boat of your own, I shall not be so particular as to your  being in at ten. I do not so much mind your being out on the water,  only you must promise me that you will not be in the streets after that  hour.

There followed instantly a horse's wild snort; another; a shout; the  crack of a rifle cutting the silence as a knife cuts a taut string;  another crack; an awful, hoarse growl; the furious thudding of horse's  hoofs stampeding and growing fainter and fainter; and an appalling  series of receding, short, coughing, terrifying, grunting roars.  Then  silence and utter stillness only, and the cold, calm moon staring down  over all.    Gulo picked himself up after a bit, and slouched round the tree to  investigate.  He found tracks there, and blood; and the tracks were the  biggest footprints of a bear--a brown bear--that he had ever come  across, and I suppose that he must have sniffed at a few in his time.    Presumably the man had fired at the bear when the startled horse shied.  Presumably, too, the bear was hit.  He had gone straight away in the  track of horse and man, anyway, and--he had saved the wolverine's life,  after, with paw and teeth, doing his best to end it.  Possibly he had  been disturbed in the process of making his winter home.    Gulo lay low, or hunted very furtively, after that for some time, until  it was little less dark in the east than it had been, and the gaunt  tree-trunks were standing out a fraction from the general gloom.  The  moon had apparently nearly burnt itself out.  Still, it yet appeared to  be night.    Gulo was a long way out of his own hunting-district, and guessed that  it was about time for him to get himself out of sight.  He had a  passionate hatred of the day, by the way, even beyond most night  hunters.    On the way he smelt out and dug up a grouse beneath the snow.    Dawn found him, or, rather, failed to find him, hidden under a tangled  mass that was part windfall, part brush-wood, and part snow.  The place  had belonged to a fox the night before, and that red worthy returned  soon after dawn.  He thrust an inquiring sharp muzzle inside, took one  sniff, and, with every hair alift, retired in haste, without waiting to  hear the villainous growl that followed him.  The smell was enough for  him--a most calamitous stink.    It snowed all that day, and things grew quieter and quieter, except in  the tree-tops, where the wind spoke viciously between its teeth.  When  Gulo came out that evening, he had to dig part of the way, and he  viewed a still and silent, white world, under a sky like the lid of a  lead box, very low down.  He stood higher against the tree-trunks than  he had done the night before, and, though he did not know it, was safe  from any horse, for the snow was quite deep.  The cold was awful, but  it did not seem to trouble him, as he slouched slowly southward.    There appeared to be nothing alive at all throughout this white land,  but you must never trust to that in the wild.  Things there are very  rarely what they seem.  For instance, Gulo came into a clearing, dim  under the night sky, though it would never be dark that night.  To the  ear and the eye that clearing was as empty as a swept room.  To Gulo's  nose it was not, and he was just about to crouch and execute a stalk,  when half the snow seemed to get up and run away.  The runners were  wood-hares.  They had \"frozen\" stiff on the alarm from their sentries.  But it was not Gulo who had caused them to depart.  Him, behind a tree,  they had not spotted.  Something remained--something that moved.  And  Gulo saw it when it moved--not before.  It was an ermine, a stoat in  winter dress, white as driven snow.  Then it caught sight of Gulo, or,  more likely, the gleam of his eyes, and departed also.    Gulo slouched on, head down, back humped, tail low, a most  dejected-looking, out-at-heels tramp of the wilderness.    Once he came upon a wild cat laying scientific siege to a party of  grouse.  The grouse were nowhere to be seen; nor was the wild cat,  after Gulo announced his intention to break his neutrality.  Gulo knew  where the grouse were.  He dug down into the snow, and came upon a  tunnel.  He dug farther, and came upon other tunnels, round and clean,  in the snow.  All the tunnels smelt of grouse, but devil a grouse could  he find.  He had come a bit early.  It was as yet barely night, and he  should have waited till later, when they would be more asleep.  However, he dug on along the tunnels, driving the grouse before him.  And then a strange thing happened.  About three yards ahead of him the  snow burst--burst, I say, like a six-inch shell, upwards.  There was a  terrific commotion, a wild, whirring, whirling smother, a cloud of  white, and away went five birds, upon heavily beating wings, into the  gathering gloom.  Gulo went away, too, growling deep down inside of,  and to, himself.    He was hungry, was Gulo.  Indeed, there did not seem to be many times  when he was not hungry.  Also, being angry--not even a wild animal  likes failure--he was seeking a sacrifice; but he had crossed the  plain, which the night before had been as a nightmare desert to him,  and the moon was up before his chance came.    He crossed the trail of the reindeer.  He did not know anything about  those reindeer, mark you, whether they were wild or semi-tame; and _I_  do not know, though _he_ may have done, how old the trail was.  It was  sufficient for him that they _were_ reindeer, and that they had  traveled in the general direction that he wanted to go.  For the  rest--he had the patience, perhaps more than the patience, of a cat,  the determination of a bulldog, and the nose of a bloodhound.  He  trailed those reindeer the better part of that night, and most of the  time it snowed, and part of the time it snowed hard.    By the time a pale, frozen dawn crept weakly over the forest tree-tops  Gulo must have been well up on the trail of that herd, and he had  certainly traveled an astonishing way.  He had dug up one lemming--a  sort of square-ended relation of the rat, with an abbreviated tail--and  pounced upon one pigmy owl, scarce as large as a thrush, which he did  not seem to relish much--perhaps owl is an acquired taste--before he  turned a wild cat out of its lair--to the accompaniment of a whole  young riot of spitting and swearing--and curled up for the day.    He was hungry when he went to sleep.  Also, it was snowing then.  When  he woke up it was almost dark, and snowing worse than ever.  If it  could have been colder, it was.    While he cleaned himself Gulo took stock of the outside prospect, so  far as the white curtain allowed to sight, and by scent a good deal  that it did not.  This without appearing outside the den, you  understand.  And if there had been any enemy in hiding, waiting for him  outside, he would have discovered the fact then.  He had many enemies,  and no friends, had Gulo.  All that he received from all whom he met  was hate, but he gave back more than he got.  In the lucid terms of the  vernacular, he \"was a hard un, if you like.\"    Nothing and nobody saw the wolverine leave that lair that was not his.  He must have chosen one blinding squall of snow for the purpose, and  was half a mile away, still on the track of the reindeer, before he  showed himself--shuffling along as usual, a ragged, hard-bitten  ruffian.  And three hours later he came up with his prey.    Gulo knew it, but nobody else could have done.  There were just the  straight trees ahead, and all around the eternal white, frozen silence,  and the snow falling softly over everything; but Gulo was as certain  that there was the herd close ahead as he was that he was ravenous.  And thereafter Gulo got to work, the peculiar work, a special devilish  genius for which appears to be given to the wolverine.    He ceased to exist.  At least, nothing of him was seen, not a tail, not  an eye-gleam.  Yet during the next two hours he learnt everything,  private and public, there was to be learnt.  Also, he had been over the  surroundings almost to a yard.  Nothing could have escaped him.  No  detail of risk and danger, of the chance of being seen even, had been  overlooked; for he was a master at his craft, the greatest master in  the wild, perhaps.  The wolf?  My dear sirs, the wolf was an innocent  suckling cub beside Gulo, look you, and his brain and his cunning were  not the brain and the cunning of a beast at all, but of a devil.    When, after a very long time, he reappeared upon his original track, it  was as a dark blotch, indistinguishable from a dozen other dark blots  of moon-shadow, creeping forward belly-flat in the snow.  This  belly-creep, hugging always every available inch of cover, he kept up  till he came to a big clearing, and--there were the reindeer.  At  least, there was one reindeer, a doe, standing with her back towards  him--a quite young doe.  The rest were half-hidden in the snow, which  they had trampled into a maze of paths in and out about the clearing,  which was, in fact, what is called their \"yard.\"    A minute of tense silence followed after Gulo had got as close as he  could without being seen.  Then he rushed.    The reindeer swung half-round, gave one snort, and a great bound.  But  Gulo had covered half the intervening space before she knew, and when  she bounded it was with him hanging on to her.    Followed instantly a wild upspringing of snorting beasts, and a mad,  senseless stampede of floundering deer all round and about the  clearing--a fearful mix-up, somewhere in the midst of which,  half-hidden by flying, finely powdered snow, Gulo did his prey horribly  to death.    There was something ghastly about this murder, for the deer was so big,  and Gulo comparatively small.  The fearful work of his jaws and his  immense strength seemed wrong somehow, and out of all"]]]
