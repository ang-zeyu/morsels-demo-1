In the land they had quitted the  air was dense with moisture; scarcely a hill was to be seen; they were  hemmed in by sluggish rivers and by the sea, which leaned heavily  against the dykes and threw its spray angrily down on to the reclaimed  pastures which had been stolen from it.    The original Dutch settlement at the Cape was made by a Company of  Amsterdam merchants for the refreshment and refitting of their ships  engaged in trade with the East. The Company was a harsh and extortionate  master, who paid little attention to the needs and the welfare of the  settlement, which was regarded merely as a place of call. The  discontented colonists began to leave the seacoast and trekked inwards,  where the heavy hands of the cordially detested representatives of the  Company could not reach them. Its rule came to an end in 1795, when, at  the request of Holland, Great Britain took over the Colony in order to  prevent it falling into the hands of France. It was restored at the  Peace of Amiens, but in a few years again came into the possession of  Great Britain.    The Colonies of the Empire were at that time administered by a Branch of  the War Office which regarded the Cape settlement much in the same light  as it had been regarded by the Dutch Company, as a necessary but  troublesome dep√¥t on the way to the East; and had the Overland Route and  the Suez Canal been available a generation earlier it would probably  have been abandoned.    The Boers hoped that their new masters, who at least were not an  association of Amsterdam merchants absorbed in their ledgers, would  treat them with more sympathy and consideration. But the only serious  colonial problem with which British politicians had up to that time been  called upon to deal was in North America, and they had disastrously  failed in their attempt to solve it. They were without experience in the  management of white plantations, they shirked the future and looked only  to the \"ignorant present,\" and their policy in South Africa was based  upon two principles: that on no account must the boundaries of the  Empire be enlarged and new responsibilities incurred, and that in all  quarrels between white man and black man the presumption was that the  white man was in the wrong.    The Great Trek of 1836-7 was brought about by the emancipation of the  slaves and by the refusal or inability of the Government to protect the  farmers against the raids of the \"Kaffir\"[4] tribes on the border. There  is no doubt that enslaved Hottentots, Bushmen, and even Malays who had  been with the knowledge of the authorities imported from Madagascar and  Malacca, were often ill-treated by individual slave-owners; but the  Boers resented the charge of wholesale cruelty which was made against  them, and the favour and patronage bestowed upon native tribes.  Moreover, although the slave-owners were entitled to compensation for  the loss of their helots, the fund was administered in London, with the  result that a considerable proportion of the already inadequate sum was  retained in the hands of agents.    The object of the Great Trek was deliverance from the harsh and hostile  jurisdiction of the British Government, and the setting up of a new and  independent Boer community in Natal, which was reported to be a promised  land flowing with milk and honey. The Boers proposed to shake themselves  free from the Egyptian and to occupy Canaan.    The _voortrekkers_, among whom was the boy Paul Kruger, slowly passed  away towards the north and crossed the Orange River. Moshesh, the chief  of the Basutos, watched curiously from his mountains the trains of  wagons strung out on the veld, but refrained from molesting the  emigrants. Not so Moselekatse,[5] a chief who had formerly broken away  from Chaka and had set himself up beyond the Vaal, and who subsequently  founded the Matabele Kingdom in which he was succeeded by his son  Lobengula. He swooped down upon the advanced parties, who defended  themselves with success and afterwards chastised him in his own country,  in which, hidden from his eyes, lay the gold-bearing reefs of  Johannesburg.    Meanwhile the British Government had forged a useless and clumsy weapon  for the coercion of its \"erring and misguided\" subjects. It was held by  the lawyers that the trekkers could not at will and by the simple  process of migration throw off their allegiance to the Crown of England,  and a declaratory Act was passed under which all British subjects south  of Latitude 25, whether within or without the colony, could be arrested  and punished.    The Boer scouts discovered passes over the Drakensberg which gave them a  readier access than they had expected into Natal. It had not recovered  from the devastations of Chaka and was thinly inhabited. Settlements  were made near the banks of the Tugela, while Piet Retief, after a brief  visit to Durban, went on to negotiate with Dingaan at the royal kraal of  Umgungundhlovu in Zululand. He was received with some cordiality, but  accused of participating in a recent cattle raid. Retief, to show his  good faith, offered to catch the robber, a chief named Sikunyela, whose  kraal was a hundred miles away. He found Sikunyela, who greatly admired  the glistening rings of a pair of handcuffs shown him by the slim  Dutchman, and who was even persuaded that they would be a becoming  ornament to a native chief. He tried them on, but a more intimate  acquaintance with the use of handcuffs induced him to surrender the  cattle he had stolen from Dingaan, the King of the Zulus.    Again Retief with a hundred followers waited upon Dingaan at  Umgungundhlovu, and after military displays on each side received from  him a grant of the same land which Chaka had already given to the  British pioneers of Durban. Next day the Boers were received in farewell  audience by Dingaan, by whose orders they were treacherously surrounded  and led out to the place of execution, a hill of mimosas outside the  royal kraal, where they were put to death.    There remained the defenceless plantations on the Tugela. Before the  news of the massacre could reach them, and while they were hourly  expecting the return of Retief, Dingaan's impis swooped down upon them  from Zululand. At the cost of the lives of 600 men, women, and children,  the tribes were driven back, and the little town of Weenen, the \"place  of weeping,\" remains to mark the spot.    Soon other parties of emigrants came in from beyond the Drakensberg, and  in 1838 an expedition under Potgieter failed to punish Dingaan for his  treachery. Nor did an attempt to help the emigrants made by the British  settlers at Durban meet with success. A small force of Natal natives  under an Englishman named Biggar was greatly out-numbered at the mouth  of the Tugela and perished almost to a man. Dingaan retaliated by  sending an impi to Durban, which he held for a few days; the settlers  taking refuge on board a ship in the Bay.    The Boers were disheartened and many of them trekked back to the veld  beyond the Drakensberg passes, which is now the Orange River Colony.  Their position in face of Dingaan seemed hopeless; but in November,  1838, there came out of the Cape Colony one Pretorius. He had heard of  their distress, and he organized a force of 500 men, with whom, on  December 16, he successfully encountered Dingaan's army and slew 3,000  of his warriors at the Blood River, an affluent of the Buffalo. Dingaan  fled and the column marched on to Umgungundhlovu, where Retief's  mouldering body was found on the hill of mimosas, and on it the deed of  grant of land at Durban. Pretorius was ambushed by Zulus disguised as  cattle, crawling on all fours and wearing ox hides; but he escaped with  slight loss, and returned to the Tugela. \"Dingaan's Day,\" December 16,  is kept by the Boers as a festival of thanksgiving and rejoicing.    Soon a new complication beset the harassed emigrants. In December, 1838,  the British Government, anxious to stop the wars between the Boers and  the natives and to exclude the former from the sea, sent one hundred  soldiers to Durban and issued a proclamation in which the Boers were  declared to be British subjects who had unlawfully occupied Natal, and  who were morally responsible for all the blood that had been shed. They  protested against the imputation and against the military occupation of  Durban, but took no active steps to resent the affront.    When twelve months had passed without hostilities between Boer and  native, the British Government withdrew its hundred warriors from Durban  and tacitly handed over Natal to the emigrant Boers. Hardly had the  little transport _Vectis_ catted her anchor when the Republic of Natalia  was proclaimed and its flag run up on the staff of the forsaken British  Camp on Durban Bay.    But the dog-in-the-manger policy of neither incorporating Natal in the  British Empire nor frankly allowing the Boers to occupy it could not be  indefinitely maintained. Each present difficulty wriggled out of made  the future more embarrassing. Soon, as might have been anticipated, the  Boers were again in trouble with the natives. Panda, the father of  Cetchwayo, whose impis forty years after washed their spears in the  blood of 800 British soldiers at Isandhlwana, broke away from his  brother Dingaan, taking with him into Natal many thousand Zulus who were  awaiting an opportunity of shaking themselves free from the tyranny and  cruelty of Dingaan. Panda made overtures to the Boers and was gladly  received as an ally, and with his help Dingaan was finally crushed and  driven into Swaziland, where, in the hands of a hostile tribe, he  perished miserably by torture.    The emigrants were now favourably situated in Natal. They"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#3)"],[1,"auction.  She  has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing.  You  can't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar  bill and get some change--when you've never had more than a few cents  in your life.  I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance.    Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia Rutledge  Pendleton the least so.  It's queer what a mixture the registrar can  make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks everything is  funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything.  She never  makes the slightest effort to be amiable.  She believes that if you are  a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further  examination.  Julia and I were born to be enemies.    And now I suppose you've been waiting very impatiently to hear what I  am learning?    I. Latin:  Second Punic war.

It does dreadful things to  your liver.                                                         Wednesday    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I've changed my name.    I'm still 'Jerusha' in the catalogue, but I'm 'Judy' everywhere else.  It's really too bad, isn't it, to have to give yourself the only pet  name you ever had?  I didn't quite make up the Judy though.  That's  what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly.    I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing  babies' names.  She gets the last names out of the telephone  book--you'll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian  names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone.  I've always hated  it; but I rather like Judy.  It's such a silly name.  It belongs to the  kind of girl I'm not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and  spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any  cares.  Wouldn't it be nice to be like that?  Whatever faults I may  have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family!  But it's great fun to pretend I've been.  In the future please always  address me as Judy.    Do you want to know something?  I have three pairs of kid gloves.  I've  had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid  gloves with five fingers.  I take them out and try them on every little  while.  It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.    (Dinner bell.  Goodbye.)                                                         Friday    What do you think, Daddy?  The English instructor said that my last  paper shows an unusual amount of originality.  She did, truly.  Those  were her words.  It doesn't seem possible, does it, considering the  eighteen years of training that I've had?  The aim of the John Grier  Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) is to turn the  ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.    The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early  age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.    I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my  youth?  But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become too  impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques.  That isn't a  very polite thing to say--but you can't expect me to have any manners;  a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.    You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college.  It's the play.  Half the time I don't know what the girls are talking  about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has  shared.  I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand the  language.  It's a miserable feeling.  I've had it all my life.  At the  high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me.  I was  queer and different and everybody knew it.  I could FEEL 'John Grier  Home' written on my face.  And then a few charitable ones would make a  point of coming up and saying something polite.  I HATED EVERY ONE OF  THEM--the charitable ones most of all.    Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum.  I told Sallie  McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old  gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it  goes.  I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be  like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood  is the one great big difference.  If I can turn my back on that and  shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as desirable as any  other girl.  I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference,  do you?    Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!

Saturday morning    I've just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty  un-cheerful. But can't you guess that I have a special topic due Monday  morning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold?                                                     Sunday    I forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an indignant postscript.  We had a bishop this morning, and WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?    'The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this, \"The poor ye  have always with you.\"  They were put here in order to keep us  charitable.'    The poor, please observe, being a sort of useful domestic animal.  If I  hadn't grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after  service and told him what I thought.                                                     25th October    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I'm in the basket-ball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left  shoulder.  It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange.  Julia  Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn't get in.  Hooray!    You see what a mean disposition I have.    College gets nicer and nicer.  I like the girls and the teachers and  the classes and the campus and the things to eat.  We have ice-cream  twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.    You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you?  And I've  been peppering you with letters every few days!  But I've been so  excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody;  and you're the only one I know.  Please excuse my exuberance; I'll  settle pretty soon.  If my letters bore you, you can always toss them  into the wastebasket.  I promise not to write another till the middle  of November.                       Yours most loquaciously,                                             Judy Abbott                                                   15th November    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Listen to what I've learned to-day.    The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is  half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the  altitude of either of its trapezoids.    It doesn't sound true, but it is--I can prove it!    You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?  Six dresses, all  new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from somebody  bigger.  Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks in the  career of an orphan?  You gave them to me, and I am very, very, VERY  much obliged.  It's a fine thing to be educated--but nothing compared  to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses.  Miss Pritchard,  who is on the visiting committee, picked them out--not Mrs. Lippett,  thank goodness.  I have an evening dress, pink mull over silk (I'm  perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a dinner  dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes me look like a  Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis, and a grey street suit,  and an every-day dress for classes.  That wouldn't be an awfully big  wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha  Abbott--Oh, my!    I suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little beast  she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?    But, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life,  you'd appreciate how I feel.  And when I started to the high school, I  entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.    The poor box.    You can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable  poor-box dresses.  I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to  the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper and giggle and  point it out to the others.  The bitterness of wearing your enemies'  cast-off clothes eats into your soul.  If I wore silk stockings for the  rest of my life, I don't believe I could obliterate the scar.                               LATEST WAR BULLETIN!
