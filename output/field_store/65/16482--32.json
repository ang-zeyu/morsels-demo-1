In carrying on the process, I made no use whatever  of any arbitrary, conventional look, motion, or attitude, before  settled between us, by which to let him understand what I wished to  communicate, with the exception of a single one, if, indeed, it ought  to be considered such.    \"The usual sign, at that time, among the teachers and pupils, for  a Roman, was portraying an aquiline nose by placing the forefinger,  crooked, in front of the nose. As I was prevented from using my finger  in this way, and having considerable command over the muscles of my  face, I endeavored to give my nose as much of the aquiline form as  possible, and succeeded well enough for my purpose....    \"The outlines of the process were the following:    \"A stretching and stretching gaze eastward, with an undulating motion  of the head, as if looking across and beyond the Atlantic Ocean,  to denote that the event happened, not on the western, but eastern  continent. This was making a little progress, as it took the subject  out of the range of American history.    \"A turning of the eyes upward and backward, with frequently-repeated  motions of the head backward, as if looking a great way back in past  time, to denote that the event was one of ancient date.    \"The aquiline shape of the nose, already referred to, indicating that  a Roman was the person concerned. It was, of course, an old Roman.    \"Portraying, as well as I could, by my countenance, attitude, and  manner an individual high in authority, and commanding others, as if  he expected to be obeyed.    \"Looking and acting as if I were giving out a specific order to many  persons, and threatening punishment on those who should resist my  authority, even the punishment of death.    \"Here was a pause in the progress of events, which I denoted by  sleeping as it were during the night and awakening in the morning, and  doing this several times, to signify that several days had elapsed.    \"Looking with deep interest and surprise, as if at a single person  brought and standing before me, with an expression of countenance  indicating that he had violated the order which I had given, and that  I knew it. Then looking in the same way at another person near him as  also guilty. Two offending persons were thus denoted.    \"Exhibiting serious deliberation, then hesitation, accompanied with  strong conflicting emotions, producing perturbation, as if I knew not  how to feel or what to do.    \"Looking first at one of the persons before me, and then at the other,  and then at both together, _as a father would look_, indicating his  distressful parental feelings under such afflicting circumstances.    \"Composing my feelings, showing that a change was coming over me, and  exhibiting towards the imaginary persons before me the decided look of  the inflexible commander, who was determined and ready to order them  away to execution. Looking and acting as if the tender and forgiving  feelings of _the father_ had again got the ascendency, and as if I was  about to relent and pardon them.    \"These alternating states of mind I portrayed several times, to make  my representations the more graphic and impressive.    \"At length the father yields, and the stern principle of justice, as  expressed in my countenance and manners, prevails. My look and action  denote the passing of the sentence of death on the offenders, and the  ordering them away to execution.           *       *       *       *       *    \"He quickly turned round to his slate and wrote a correct and complete  account of this story of Brutus and his two sons.\"           *       *       *       *       *    While it appears that the expressions of the features are not confined  to the emotions or to distinguishing synonyms, it must be remembered  that the meaning of the same motion of hands, arms, and fingers is  often modified, individualized, or accentuated by associated facial  changes and postures of the body not essential to the sign, which  emotional changes and postures are at once the most difficult to  describe and the most interesting when intelligently reported, not  only because they infuse life into the skeleton sign, but because they  may belong to the class of innate expressions.          THE ORIGIN OF SIGN LANGUAGE.    In observing the maxim that nothing can be thoroughly understood  unless its beginning is known, it becomes necessary to examine into  the origin of sign language through its connection with that of oral  speech. In this examination it is essential to be free from the vague  popular impression that some oral language, of the general character  of that now used among mankind, is \"natural\" to mankind. It will be  admitted on reflection that all oral languages were at some past time  far less serviceable to those using them than they are now, and as  each particular language has been thoroughly studied it has become  evident that it grew out of some other and less advanced form. In  the investigation of these old forms it has been so difficult to  ascertain how any of them first became a useful instrument of  inter-communication that many conflicting theories on this subject  have been advocated.    Oral language consists of variations and mutations of vocal sounds  produced as signs of thought and emotion. But it is not enough that  those signs should be available as the vehicle of the producer's own  thoughts. They must be also efficient for the communication of such  thoughts to others. It has been, until of late years, generally held  that thought was not possible without oral language, and that, as man  was supposed to have possessed from the first the power of thought, he  also from the first possessed and used oral language substantially  as at present. That the latter, as a special faculty, formed the  main distinction between man and the brutes has been and still is  the prevailing doctrine. In a lecture delivered before the British  Association in 1878 it was declared that \"animal intelligence is  unable to elaborate that class of abstract ideas, the formation of  which depends upon the faculty of speech.\" If instead of \"speech\" the  word \"utterance\" had been used, as including all possible modes of  intelligent communication, the statement might pass without criticism.  But it may be doubted if there is any more necessary connection  between abstract ideas and sounds, the mere signs of thought, that  strike the ear, than there is between the same ideas and signs  addressed only to the eye.    The point most debated for centuries has been, not whether there  was any primitive oral language, but what that language was. Some  literalists have indeed argued from the Mosaic narrative that because  the Creator, by one supernatural act, with the express purpose to  form separate peoples, had divided all tongues into their present  varieties, and could, by another similar exercise of power, obliterate  all but one which should be universal, the fact that he had not  exercised that power showed it not to be his will that any man to  whom a particular speech had been given should hold intercourse with  another miraculously set apart from him by a different speech. By this  reasoning, if the study of a foreign tongue was not impious, it was  at least clear that the primitive language had been taken away as a  disciplinary punishment, as the Paradisiac Eden had been earlier lost,  and that, therefore, the search for it was as fruitless as to attempt  the passage of the flaming sword. More liberal Christians have been  disposed to regard the Babel story as allegorical, if not mythical,  and have considered it to represent the disintegration of tongues  out of one which was primitive. In accordance with the advance of  linguistic science they have successively shifted back the postulated  primitive tongue from Hebrew to Sanscrit, then to Aryan, and now seek  to evoke from the vasty deeps of antiquity the ghosts of other rival  claimants for precedence in dissolution. As, however, the languages of  man are now recognized as extremely numerous, and as the very sounds  of which these several languages are composed are so different that  the speakers of some are unable to distinguish with the ear certain  sounds in others, still less able to reproduce them, the search for  one common parent language is more difficult than was supposed by  mediaeval ignorance.    The discussion is now, however, varied by the suggested possibility  that man at some time may have existed without any oral language. It  is conceded by some writers that mental images or representations can  be formed without any connection with sound, and may at least serve  for thought, though not for expression. It is certain that concepts,  however formed, can be expressed by other means than sound. One mode  of this expression is by gesture, and there is less reason to believe  that gestures commenced as the interpretation of, or substitute for  words than that the latter originated in, and served to translate  gestures. Many arguments have been advanced to prove that gesture  language preceded articulate speech and formed the earliest attempt  at communication, resulting from the interacting subjective and  objective conditions to which primitive man was exposed. Some of the  facts on which deductions have been based, made in accordance with  well-established modes of scientific research from study of the lower  animals, children, idiots, the lower types of mankind, and deaf-mutes,  will be briefly mentioned.        _GESTURES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS._    Emotional expression in the features of man is to be considered in  reference to the fact that the special senses either have their seat  in, or are in close relation to the face, and that so large a number  of nerves pass to it from"]]]
