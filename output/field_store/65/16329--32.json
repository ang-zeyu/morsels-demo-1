Then passing her arm affectionately about her daughter's waist, she drew  her on toward the house, her father and son accompanying them.    She parted with Elsie at the door of the sick-room, embracing her tenderly  and bidding her \"'Be strong and of a good courage,' my darling, for 'the  eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.'\"    \"Dearest mamma, what sweet words!\" said the weeping girl. \"Oh, how glad I  am that God reigns! and that I know he will send to each of his children  just what is best.\"    She turned away as the door closed upon her mother, and found Violet close  at her side.    There was a silent affectionate embrace, and with their arms about each  other they sought Elsie's dressing-room.    \"Grandpa and Edward have told me,\" Violet said, \"and you will let me help  you, my poor dear sister? help in thinking and selecting what you will  want to carry with you.\"    \"Gladly, thankfully, for oh, I seem scarcely able to collect my thoughts!  How can I leave mamma and all of you? and the darling little brother and  sister so ill! and yet how can I stay away from Lester when he is sick and  alone in a strange land, with not a friend to speak a cheering word,  smooth his pillow, give his medicine, or see that he has proper food? O  Vi, can I help going to him, even at the sacrifice of leaving all other  near and dear ones?\"    \"I think our mother would have done it for papa,\" Violet answered, kissing  Elsie's cheek.    Mr. Dinsmore having first seen Ben, and found him more than willing to go  with the children of the master he had loved as his own soul, went to the  library, looked over the papers, and had just found the information he  sought, when the sound of horses' hoofs on the avenue drew his attention,  and glancing from the window he saw the Roselands carriage drive up with  his sister, Mrs. Conly, inside.    He hastened out to assist her to alight.    \"Good-morning, Horace,\" she said. \"Is my son Arthur here?\"    \"Yes, Louise, he has spent the last hour or more in attendance upon our  sick little ones. Ah, here he is to speak for himself!\" as the young  doctor stepped from the open doorway. \"But won't you come in?\"    She demurred. \"Is there any danger, Arthur?\"    \"Danger of what, mother?\"    \"You certainly understood me,\" she said half angrily; \"danger of  contagion, of course.\"    \"None for you, surely, mother, and none you could carry home unless you  came in personal contact with the sick children.\"    \"I shall sit here for a moment, then,\" she said, stepping from the  carriage and taking a chair upon the veranda. \"How are they to-day?\"    \"The sick little ones? The disease has not yet reached its crisis.\"    \"I hope they'll get safely over it: it's a good thing to have over. How  soon can you be spared from here, Arthur?\"    \"Now, mother, if I am needed elsewhere, I shall not be needed here--at  least am not likely to be--for some hours.\"    \"Then I wish you'd come home directly to see what you can do for your  grandfather. He doesn't seem at all well to-day.\"    \"My father ill?\" Mr. Dinsmore exclaimed in a tone of alarm and concern.    \"It hardly amounts to that, I presume,\" Mrs. Conly answered coldly; \"but  he is not well; didn't eat a mouthful of breakfast.\"    \"Grandpa, did you find what you wanted in the morning paper?\" queried  Edward, joining them at this moment. \"Ah, Aunt Louise, how d'ye do?\"    She nodded indifferently, listening with some curiosity for her brother's  reply.    \"Yes,\" he said; \"and I think you should leave to-night; for by so doing  you will reach New York in time to take the next steamer, if you meet with  no great detention on the way. Do you think you can both be ready?\"    \"I certainly can, sir, and have no doubt Elsie will also.\"    \"What is it? off to Europe?\" asked Mrs. Conly in surprise. \"What should  call you two children there at this time?\"    Mr. Dinsmore briefly stated the facts, giving the news of the morning,  Elsie's wish, and Edward's offer to be her escort to Italy.    \"If she were a daughter of mine, I should consider a female companion an  absolute necessity,\" was Mrs. Conly's comment.    \"She will take her maid of course,\" said Mr. Dinsmore and Edward, both  speaking at once.    \"Pooh! a maid! I mean a lady relative or friend. I said a companion, and  that a maid could not be.\"    \"I should be extremely glad if such could be found in the few hours that  we have for our preparations,\" said her brother, \"but I know of none; the  Fairview family are absent, Violet is too young----\"    \"Of course,\" interrupted Mrs. Conly; \"but there are other relatives. I  would go myself if my means would warrant the expense.\"    \"If you are in earnest, Louise, you need not hesitate for a moment on that  score; it shall not cost you a penny,\" her brother said, looking at her in  pleased but half-incredulous surprise.    \"I was never more in earnest,\" she answered. \"I don't think you give me  much credit for affection for your grandchildren, yet I certainly care too  much for the one in question to willingly see her undertake such a journey  without the support of female companionship. And I can be spared from  home if you and Arthur will look after father; I have no young child now,  and Aunt Maria is fully capable of taking charge of all household matters.  If you wish me to go you have only to say so and guarantee my expenses,  and I shall go home, oversee the packing of my trunks, and be ready as  soon as the young people are.\"    \"Your offer is a most kind one, Louise, and I accept it even without  waiting to consult with my daughter,\" Mr. Dinsmore said.    \"Then I must go home at once, and set about my preparations immediately,\"  she said, rising to take leave.    Arthur Conly as well as Edward Travilla had been a surprised but silent  listener to the short dialogue.    \"Can you spare your mother, Arthur?\" his uncle asked.    \"We must, sir, if it pleases her to go, and for the sake of my two sweet  cousins--Elsie senior and Elsie junior--I willingly consent. You take the  night train I understand?\" turning to Edward.    \"Yes; to-night.\"    \"I shall see that my mother is at the depot in season;\" and with that they  took their departure, Mr. Dinsmore saying, as he bade them adieu, that he  should ride over presently to see his father.    Turning toward Edward, he saw that the lad's eyes were following the  Roselands' carriage down the avenue, his face wearing a rueful look.    \"Grandpa,\" he said with a sigh, \"I see no necessity for Aunt Louise's  company, and, indeed, should very much prefer to be without it.\"    \"You forget that you are speaking to your grandfather of his sister,\" Mr.  Dinsmore answered, with a touch of sternness in his tone.    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" returned Edward. \"She is so unlike you that I am  apt to forget the relationship.\"    \"I know you do not always find your aunt's company agreeable,\" remarked  Mr. Dinsmore, \"and I do not blame you on that account, yet I think it will  be an advantage to you, and especially to your sister, to have with you a  woman of her age and knowledge of the world. I wish I could go with you  myself, but I cannot think of leaving either my old father or your mother  in this time of trial.\"    \"No, sir, oh no! Delightful as it would be to both of us for you to make  one of our little party, we would not for the world deprive dear mamma of  the support and comfort of your presence here; nor our dear old  grandfather either.\"          CHAPTER III.                              \"Filial ingratitude?      Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand      For lifting food to 't?\"    --_Shaks. Lear_.      \"This is a very sudden resolve of yours, mother, isn't it?\" Dr. Conly  asked, as they drove through the great gates at Ion, into the highway.    \"It is, Arthur, for I had not dreamed of such a wild scheme on the part of  those two silly children until I heard of it from their grandfather's  lips; nor could have believed he would sanction such folly. They ought to  make Elsie stay where she is, and if young Leland dies it will but rid the  family of a prospective plebeian alliance.\"    \"Very possibly of the sweet girl also,\" was Arthur's grave response.    \"Nonsense! it is only in novels that girls die of broken hearts.\"    \"Granting that for argument's sake, it must be very hard to live with  one.\"    \"Well; it seems she is to be allowed to go, and my offer removes the most  serious objection; yet I have no idea that the sacrifice on my part will  be at all appreciated.\"    \"Then why make it, mother? I can readily find a substitute; there is Mrs.  Foster, whose health would be greatly benefited by a long sea voyage. She,  I feel certain, would think it a great boon to be allowed this opportunity  of going without expense and in the company of two young people of whom  she is very fond. And you know, mother, that though poor now she was  formerly wealthy, is a perfect lady, and her having been to Europe once or  twice would make her all the more valuable companion to them.\"    \"You are quite too late with your suggestion, Arthur,\" was the coldly  spoken reply. \"I have passed my word and shall not break it.\"    Her son gave her a look of keen scrutiny, then turned his face from her  with a scarcely audible sigh. He read her motives and feelings far more  clearly than she suspected.    The truth was she was weary of the dulness of home now that the shadow of  bereavement was upon it, and the etiquette of mourning forbade her  attendance upon public assemblages of whatever kind, except church, and  did not allow even so much as a formal call upon strangers or  acquaintance. The society of her now old, feeble, and depressed father was  wearisome to her also.    Beside she had long had a hankering after a European tour, and this was  too good an opportunity to let slip. Also it would give her a chance to  see for herself what was the trouble with Virginia, whose letters "]]]
