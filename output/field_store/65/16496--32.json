Taste which is in a formative state can  but fall in with these tendencies of the art, and must be led by  them, and led in a measure corresponding to their persistency and  universality. If the textile art had been the only one known to man,  ideas of the esthetic in shape would have been in a great measure  formed through that art. Natural forms would have had little to do  with it except through models furnished directly to and utilized by  the art, for the ideas of primitive men concentrate about that upon  which their hands work and upon which their thoughts from necessity  dwell with steady attention from generation to generation.      RELATIONS OF FORM TO ORNAMENT.    It would seem that the esthetic tendencies of the mind, failing to  find satisfactory expression in shape, seized upon the non-essential  features of the art--markings of the surface and color of  filaments--creating a new field in which to labor and expending their  energy upon ornament.    Shape has some direct relations to ornament, and these relations may  be classified as follows:    First, the contour of the vessel controls its ornament to a large  extent, dictating the positions of design and setting its limits;  figures are in stripes, zones, rays, circles, ovals, or  rectangles--according, in no slight measure, to the character of the  spaces afforded by details of contour. Secondly, it affects ornament  through the reproduction and repetition of features of form, such as  handles, for ornamental purposes. Thirdly, it is probable that shape  influences embellishment through the peculiar bias given by it to the  taste and judgment of men prior to or independent of the employment of  ornament.      COLOR IN TEXTILE ART.    Color is one of the most constant factors in man's environment, and it  is so strongly and persistently forced upon his attention, so useful  as a means of identification and distinction, that it necessarily  receives a large share of consideration. It is probably one of the  foremost objective agencies in the formation and development of the  esthetic sense.    The natural colors of textile materials are enormously varied and form  one of the chief attractions of the products of the art. The great  interest taken in color--the great importance attached to it--is  attested by the very general use of dyes, by means of which additional  variety and brilliancy of effect are secured.    Color employed in the art is not related to use, excepting, perhaps,  in symbolic and superstitious matters; nor is it of consequence in  construction, although it derives importance from the manner in which  construction causes it to be manifested to the eye. It finds its chief  use in the field of design, in making evident to the eye the figures  with which objects of art are embellished.    Color is employed or applied in two distinct ways: it is woven or  worked into the fabric by using colored filaments or parts, or it is  added to the surface of the completed object by means of pencils,  brushes, and dies. Its employment in the latter manner is especially  convenient when complex ideographic or pictorial subjects are to be  executed.      TEXTILE ORNAMENT.    DEVELOPMENT OF A GEOMETRIC SYSTEM OF DESIGN WITHIN THE ART.    INTRODUCTION.    Having made a brief study of form and color in the textile art, I  shall now present the great group or family of phenomena whose  exclusive office is that of enhancing beauty. It will be necessary,  however, to present, besides those features of the art properly  expressive of the esthetic culture of the race, all those phenomena  that, being present in the art without man's volition, tend to suggest  decorative conceptions and give shape to them. I shall show how the  latter class of features arise as a necessity of the art, how they  gradually come into notice and are seized upon by the esthetic  faculty, and how under its guidance they assist in the development of  a system of ornament of world wide application.    For convenience of treatment esthetic phenomena may be classed as  _relieved_ and _flat_. Figures or patterns of a relievo nature arise  during construction as a result of the intersections and other more  complex relations--the bindings--of the warp and woof or of inserted  or applied elements. Flat or surface features are manifested in color,  either in unison with or independent of the relieved details. Such is  the nature of the textile art that in its ordinary practice certain  combinations of both classes of features go on as a necessity of the  art and wholly without reference to the desire of the artist or to the  effect of resultant patterns upon the eye. The character of such  figures depends upon the kind of construction and upon the accidental  association of natural colors in construction.    At some period of the practice of the art these peculiar, adventitious  surface characters began to attract attention and to be cherished for  the pleasure they gave; what were at first adventitious features now  took on functions peculiar to themselves, for they were found to  gratify desires distinct from those cravings that arise directly from  physical wants.    It is not to be supposed for a moment that the inception of esthetic  notions dates from this association of ideas of beauty with textile  characters. Long before textile objects of a high class were made,  ideas of an esthetic nature had been entertained by the mind, as, for  example, in connection with personal adornment. The skin had been  painted, pendants placed about the neck, and bright feathers set in  the hair to enhance attractiveness, and it is not difficult to  conceive of the transfer of such ideas from purely personal  associations to the embellishment of articles intimately associated  with the person. No matter, however, what the period or manner of the  association of such ideas with the textile art, that association may  be taken as the datum point in the development of a great system of  decoration whose distinguishing characters are the result of the  geometric textile construction.    In amplifying this subject I find it convenient to treat separately  the two classes of decorative phenomena--the relieved and the  flat--notwithstanding the fact that they are for the most part  intimately associated and act together in the accomplishment of a  common end.      RELIEF PHENOMENA.    _Ordinary features._--The relieved surface characters of fabrics  resulting from construction and available for decoration are more or  less distinctly perceptible to the eye and to the touch and are  susceptible of unlimited variation in detail and arrangement. Such  features are familiar to all in the strongly marked ridges of  basketry, and much more pleasingly so in the delicate figures of  damasks, embroideries, and laces. So long as the figures produced are  confined exclusively to the necessary features of unembellished  construction, as is the case in very primitive work and in all plain  work, the resultant patterns are wholly geometric and by endless  repetition of like parts extremely monotonous.    In right angled weaving the figures combine in straight lines, which  run parallel or cross at uniform distances and angles. In radiate  weaving, as in basketry, the radial lines are crossed in an equally  formal manner by concentric lines. In other classes of combination  there is an almost equal degree of geometricity.    When, however, with the growth of intelligence and skill it is found  that greater variety of effect can be secured by modifying the  essential combinations of parts, and that, too, without interfering  with constructive perfection or with use, a new and wide field is  opened for the developmental tendencies of textile decoration.    Moreover, in addition to the facilities afforded by the necessary  elements of construction, there are many extraneous resources of which  the textile decorator may freely avail himself. The character of these  is such that the results, however varied, harmonize thoroughly with  indigenous textile forms.    To make these points quite clear it will be necessary to analyze  somewhat closely the character and scope of textile combination and of  the resultant and associated phenomena.    We may distinguish two broad classes of constructive phenomena made  use of in the expression of relieved enrichment. As indicated above,  these are, first, essential or actual constructive features and,  second, extra or superconstructive features.    First, it is found that in the practice of primitive textile art a  variety of methods of combination or bindings of the parts have been  evolved and utilized, and we observe that each of these--no matter  what the material or what the size and character of the filamental  elements--gives rise to distinct classes of surface effects. Thus it  appears that peoples who happen to discover and use like combinations  produce kindred decorative results, while those employing unlike  constructions achieve distinct classes of surface embellishment. These  constructive peculiarities have a pretty decided effect upon the style  of ornament, relieved or colored, and must be carefully considered in  the treatment of design; but it is found that each type of combination  has a greatly varied capacity of expression, tending to obliterate  sharp lines of demarkation between the groups of results. It sometimes  even happens that in distinct types of weaving almost identical  surface effects are produced.    It will not be necessary in this connection to present a full series  of the fundamental bindings or orders of combination, as a few will  suffice to illustrate the principles involved and to make clear the  bearing of this class of phenomena upon decoration. I choose, first, a  number of examples from the simplest type of weaving, that in which  the web and the woof are merely interlaced, the filaments crossing at  right angles or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],[0,"The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#3)"],[1,"off like the  scales of a fir-cone, and at length act like the fir-cone in ripening,  at last becoming entirely loose. As regards wool and fur, these scales  are of the utmost importance, for very marked differences exist even in  the wool of a single sheep, or the fur of a single hare. It is the duty  of the wool-sorter to distinguish and separate the various qualities in  each fleece, and of the furrier to do the same in the case of each fur.  In short, upon the nature and arrangement and conformation of the scales  on the hair-shafts, especially as regards those free upper edges,  depends the distinction of the value of many classes of wool and fur.  These scales vary both as to nature and arrangement in the case of the  hairs of different animals, so that by the aid of the microscope we have  often a means of determining from what kind of animal the hair has been  derived. It is on the nature of this outside scaly covering of the  shaft, and in the manner of attachment of these scaly plates, that the  true distinction between wool and hair rests. The principal epidermal  characteristic of a true wool is the capacity of its fibres to felt or  mat together. This arises from the greater looseness of the scaly  covering of the hair, so that when opposing hairs come into contact, the  scales interlock (see Fig. 9), and thus the fibres are held together.  Just as with hair, the scales of which have their free edges pointing  upwards away from the root, and towards the extremity of the hair, so  with wool. When the wool is on the back of the sheep, the scales of the  woolly hair all point in the same direction, so that while maintained in  that attitude the individual hairs slide over one another, and do not  tend to felt or mat; if they did, woe betide the animal. The fact of the  peculiar serrated, scaly structure of hair and wool is easily proved by  working a hair between the fingers. If, for instance, a human hair be  placed between finger and thumb, and gently rubbed by the alternate  motion of finger and thumb together, it will then invariably move in the  direction of the root, quite independently of the will of the person  performing the test. A glance at the form of the typical wool fibres  shown (see Fig. 10), will show the considerable difference between a  wool and a hair fibre. You will observe that the scales of the wool  fibre are rather pointed than rounded at their free edges, and that at  intervals we have a kind of composite and jagged-edged funnels, fitting  into each other, and thus making up the covering of the cylindrical  portion of the fibre. The sharpened, jagged edges enable these scales  more easily to get under the opposing scales, and to penetrate inwards  and downwards according to the pressure exerted. The free edges of the  scales of wool are much longer and deeper than in the case of hair. In  hair the overlapping scales are attached to the under layer up to the  edges of those scales, and at this extremity can only be detached by  the use of certain reagents. But this is not so with wool, for here the  ends of the scales are, for nearly two-thirds of their length, free, and  are, moreover, partially turned outwards. One of the fibres shown in  Fig. 10 is that of the merino sheep, and is one of the most valuable and  beautiful wools grown. There you have the type of a fibre best suited  for textile purposes, and the more closely different hairs approach  this, the more suitable and valuable they become for those purposes, and  _vice versa_. With regard to the curly structure of wool, which  increases the matting tendency, though the true cause of this curl is  not known, there appears to be a close relationship between the tendency  to curl, the fineness of the fibre, and the number of scales per linear  inch upon the surface. With regard to hair and fur, I have already shown  that serrated fibres are not specially peculiar to sheep, but are much  more widely diffused. Most of the higher members of the mammalia family  possess a hairy covering of some sort, and in by far the larger number  is found a tendency to produce an undergrowth of fine woolly fibre,  especially in the winter time. The differences of human hair and hairs  generally, from the higher to the lower forms of mammalia, consist only  in variations of size and arrangement as regards the cells composing the  different parts of the fibre, as well as in a greater or less  development of the scales on the covering or external hair surface.  Thus, under the microscope, the wool and hairs of various animals, as  also even hairs from different parts of the same animal, show a great  variety of structure, development, and appearance.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    [Illustration:        Finest merino wool fibre.      Typical wool fibre.      Fibre of wool from Chinese sheep.    FIG. 10.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    We have already observed that hair, if needed for felting, is all the  better--provided, of course, no injury is done to the fibre itself--for  some treatment, by which the scales otherwise lying flatter on the  hair-shafts than in the case of the hairs of wool, are made to stand up  somewhat, extending outwards their free edges. This brings me to the  consideration of a practice pursued by furriers for this purpose, and  known as the _secretage_ or \"carrotting\" process; it consists in a  treatment with a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric acid, in order  to improve the felting qualities of the fur. This acid mixture is  brushed on to the fur, which is cut from the skin by a suitable sharp  cutting or shearing machine. A Manchester furrier, who gave me specimens  of some fur untreated by the process, and also some of the same fur that  had been treated, informed me that others of his line of business use  more mercury than he does, _i.e._ leave less free nitric acid in their  mixture; but he prefers his own method, and thinks it answers best for  the promotion of felting. The treated fur he gave me was turned yellow  with the nitric acid, in parts brown, and here and there the hairs were  slightly matted with the acid. In my opinion the fur must suffer from  such unequal treatment with such strong acid, and in the final process  of finishing I should not be surprised if difficulty were found in  getting a high degree of lustre and finish upon hairs thus roughened or  partially disintegrated. Figs. 11 and 12 respectively illustrate fur  fibres from different parts of the same hare before and after the  treatment. In examining one of these fibres from the side of a hare, you  see what the cause of this roughness is, and what is also the cause of  the difficulty in giving a polish or finish. The free edges are  partially disintegrated, etched as it were, besides being caused to  stand out. A weaker acid ought to be used, or more mercury and less  acid. As we shall afterwards see, another dangerous agent, if not  carefully used, is bichrome (bichromate of potassium), which is also  liable to roughen and injure the fibre, and thus interfere with the  final production of a good finish.          LECTURE II    TEXTILE FIBRES, PRINCIPALLY WOOL, FUR, AND HAIR--_Continued_      With regard to the preparation of fur by acid mixtures for felting,  mentioned in the last lecture, I will tell you what I think I should  recommend. In all wool and fur there is a certain amount of grease, and  this may vary in different parts of the material. Where there is most,  however, the acid, nitric acid, or nitric acid solution of nitrate of  mercury, will wet, and so act on the fur, least. But the action ought to  be uniform, and I feel sure it cannot be until the grease is removed. I  should therefore first wash the felts on the fur side with a weak  alkaline solution, one of carbonate of soda, free from any caustic, to  remove all grease, then with water to remove alkali; and my belief is  that a weaker and less acid solution of nitric acid and nitrate of  mercury, and a smaller quantity of it, would then do the work required,  and do it more uniformly.    A question frequently asked is: \"Why will dead wool not felt?\" Answer:  If the animal become weak and diseased, the wool suffers degradation;  also, with improvement in health follows _pari passu_, improvement in  the wool structure, which means increase both in number and vigour of  the scales on the wool fibres, increase of the serrated ends of these,  and of their regularity. In weakness and disease the number of scales in  a given hair-shaft diminishes, and these become finer and less  pronounced. The fibres themselves also become attenuated. Hence when  disease becomes death, we have considerably degraded fibres. This is  seen clearly in the subjoined figures (see Fig. 13), which are of wool  fibres from animals that have died of disease. The fibres are attenuated  and irregular, the scale markings and edges have almost disappeared in  some places, and are generally scanty and meagre in development. It is  no wonder that such \"dead wool\" will be badly adapted for felting. \"Dead  wool\" is nearly as bad as \"kempy\" wool, in which malformation of fibre  has occurred. In such \"kemps,\" as Dr. Bowman has shown, scales have  disappeared, and the fibre has become, in part or whole, a dense,  non-cellular structure, resisting dye-penetration and felting (see Fig.  14).    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    One of the physical properties of wool is its hygroscopicity or power of  absorbing moisture. As the very structure of wool and fur fibre would  lead us to suppose, these substances are able to absorb a very  considerable amount of water without appearing damp. If exposed freely  to the air in warm and dry weather, wool retains from 8 to 10 per cent.,  and if in a damp place for some time, it may absorb as much as from"]]]
