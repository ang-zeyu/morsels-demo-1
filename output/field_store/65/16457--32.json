About fifteen or sixteen  years after, the King and Queen being absent at one of their country  villas, the young Princess was one day running up and down the palace;  she went from room to room, and at last she came into a little garret on  the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with  her spindle. This good woman had never heard of the King's orders  against spindles.    \"What are you doing there, my good woman?\" said the Princess.    \"I am spinning, my pretty child,\" said the old woman, who did not know  who the Princess was.    \"Ha!\" said the Princess, \"this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it  to me. Let me see if I can do it.\"    She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, either because she was  too quick and heedless, or because the decree of the fairy had so  ordained, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.    The good old woman, not knowing what to do, cried out for help. People  came in from every quarter; they threw water upon the face of the  Princess, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of her hands, and rubbed  her temples with cologne water; but nothing would bring her to herself.    Then the King, who came up at hearing the noise, remembered what the  fairies had foretold. He knew very well that this must come to pass,  since the fairies had foretold it, and he caused the Princess to be  carried into the finest room in his palace, and to be laid upon a bed  all embroidered with gold and silver. One would have taken her for a  little angel, she was so beautiful; for her swooning had not dimmed the  brightness of her complexion: her cheeks were carnation, and her lips  coral. It is true her eyes were shut, but she was heard to breathe  softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead.    [Illustration: \"LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO IT.\" p. 15.]    The King gave orders that they should let her sleep quietly till the  time came for her to awake. The good fairy who had saved her life by  condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin,  twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess;  but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had  seven-leagued boots, that is, boots with which he could stride over  seven leagues of ground at once. The fairy started off at once, and  arrived, about an hour later, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.    The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything he  had done; but as she had very great foresight, she thought that when the  Princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, if she  was all alone in this old palace. This was what she did: she touched  with her wand everything in the palace (except the King and  Queen),--governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber,  gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, kitchen maids, guards  with their porters, pages, and footmen; she likewise touched all the  horses which were in the stables, the cart horses, the hunters and the  saddle horses, the grooms, the great dogs in the outward court, and  little Mopsey, too, the Princess's spaniel, which was lying on the bed.    As soon as she touched them they all fell asleep, not to awake again  until their mistress did, that they might be ready to wait upon her when  she wanted them. The very spits at the fire, as full as they could hold  of partridges and pheasants, fell asleep, and the fire itself as well.  All this was done in a moment. Fairies are not long in doing their  work.    And now the King and Queen, having kissed their dear child without  waking her, went out of the palace and sent forth orders that nobody  should come near it.    These orders were not necessary; for in a quarter of an hour's time  there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees,  great and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that  neither man nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen  but the very top of the towers of the palace; and that, too, only from  afar off. Every one knew that this also was the work of the fairy in  order that while the Princess slept she should have nothing to fear from  curious people.    After a hundred years the son of the King then reigning, who was of  another family from that of the sleeping Princess, was a-hunting on that  side of the country, and he asked what those towers were which he saw in  the middle of a great thick wood. Every one answered according as they  had heard. Some said that it was an old haunted castle, others that all  the witches of the country held their midnight revels there, but the  common opinion was that it was an ogre's dwelling, and that he carried  to it all the little children he could catch, so as to eat them up at  his leisure, without any one being able to follow him, for he alone had  the power to make his way through the wood.    The Prince did not know what to believe, and presently a very aged  countryman spake to him thus:--    \"May it please your royal Highness, more than fifty years since I heard  from my father that there was then in this castle the most beautiful  princess that was ever seen; that she must sleep there a hundred years,  and that she should be waked by a king's son, for whom she was  reserved.\"    The young Prince on hearing this was all on fire. He thought, without  weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure;  and, pushed on by love and the desire of glory, resolved at once to look  into it.    As soon as he began to get near to the wood, all the great trees, the  bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through. He  walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue; and  you can imagine he was a good deal surprised when he saw none of his  people following him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had  passed through them. However, he did not cease from continuing his way;  a young prince in search of glory is ever valiant.    He came into a spacious outer court, and what he saw was enough to  freeze him with horror. A frightful silence reigned over all; the image  of death was everywhere, and there was nothing to be seen but what  seemed to be the outstretched bodies of dead men and animals. He,  however, very well knew, by the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the  porters, that they were only asleep; and their goblets, wherein still  remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that they had fallen asleep  while drinking their wine.    He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs, and came  into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with  their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring with all their might. He  went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies, some standing  and others sitting, but all were asleep. He came into a gilded chamber,  where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of which were all open, the most  beautiful sight ever beheld--a princess who appeared to be about fifteen  or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and resplendent beauty had  something divine in it. He approached with trembling and admiration, and  fell down upon his knees before her.    Then, as the end of the enchantment was come, the Princess awoke, and  looking on him with eyes more tender than could have been expected at  first sight, said:--    \"Is it you, my Prince? You have waited a long while.\"    The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in  which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude; he  assured her that he loved her better than he did himself. Their  discourse was not very connected, but they were the better pleased, for  where there is much love there is little eloquence. He was more at a  loss than she, and we need not wonder at it; she had had time to think  of what to say to him; for it is evident (though history says nothing of  it) that the good fairy, during so long a sleep, had given her very  pleasant dreams. In short, they talked together for four hours, and then  they said not half they had to say.    In the meanwhile all the palace had woke up with the Princess; every one  thought upon his own business, and as they were not in love, they were  ready to die of hunger. The lady of honor, being as sharp set as the  other folks, grew very impatient, and told the Princess aloud that the  meal was served. The Prince helped the Princess to rise. She was  entirely and very magnificently dressed; but his royal Highness took  care not to tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother,  and had a high collar. She looked not a bit the less charming and  beautiful for all that.    They went into the great mirrored hall, where they supped, and were  served by the officers of the Princess's household. The violins and  hautboys played old tunes, but they were excellent, though they had not  been played for a hundred years; and after supper, without losing any  time, the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle. They  had but very little sleep--the Princess scarcely needed any; and the  Prince left her next morning to return into the city, where his father  was greatly troubled about him.    The Prince told him that he lost his way in the forest as he was  hunting, and that he had slept in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who  gave him cheese and brown bread.    The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother  could not be persuaded that it was true; and seeing that he went almost  every day a-hunting, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17211"],[0,"A School History of the Great War (#3)"],[1,"was completed. In this  work three great men participated, as well as many lesser patriots. The  first was Garibal'di, a man of intense courage and patriotism. He  aroused the young men of Italy to the need of national union and the  expulsion of the foreigners. For over thirty years he was engaged in  various military expeditions which aided greatly in the establishment of  the national union. The second leader was of an entirely different  character. Count Cavour (ka-voor') was a statesman, a politician, a  deep student of European history, and a man of great tact. He, too,  wished for a united Italy, but he believed union could not be gained  without foreign assistance. By most skillful means he secured the  support of France and of England, while at the same time he used  Garibaldi and his revolutionists. He had succeeded, at the time of his  death in 1861, in bringing together all of Italy except Rome and Venice.  He won for the new Italian kingdom a place among the great nations of  Europe.    The third great Italian was Victor Emman'uel, king of Sardinia. He  approved of a limited monarchy, like that of England, instead of the  corrupt despotisms which existed in most of the Italian peninsula. He  knew how to use men like Cavour and Garibaldi to achieve the national  ambitions. By a popular vote in each part of Italy Victor Emmanuel was  accepted as king of the united nation. The country was not ready for a  republic; but Victor Emmanuel proved a wise national leader, willing to  reign, according to a written constitution under which the people's  representatives had the determining voice in the government. In 1870 the  king entered Rome and early the next year proclaimed the city to be the  capital of Italy.    BELGIUM.--The country we now know as Belgium has had a very checkered  history. At one time or another it has been controlled by German,  French, Spanish, and Austrian rulers. At the opening of the nineteenth  century it was annexed to the kingdom of Holland (1815). But a revolt  took place in 1830, and the Belgians separated from the Dutch and chose  a king for themselves. Their constitution declares that the government  is a \"constitutional, representative, and hereditary monarchy.\" The  government is largely in the control of the people or their  representatives. There is one voter for every five persons in the  population, nearly the same proportion as in the United States. In 1839  the principal states of Europe agreed to recognize Belgium's  independence, and in case of war among themselves to treat her territory  as neutral land, not to be invaded. This treaty was signed by Prussia as  well as by Austria, France, Great Britain, and Russia. The treaty was  again acknowledged by Prussia in 1870. It was in violation of these  treaties, as we shall see, that Prussian and other German troops invaded  Belgium on August 4, 1914.    FRANCE.--In 1789 France entered upon a period of revolution. The old  monarchy was shortly overthrown, and with it went aristocracy and all  the inequalities of the Middle Ages. A republic, however, did not long  endure; and Napoleon Bonaparte used his position as a successful general  to establish a new monarchy called the French Empire. After Napoleon's  downfall, the allied monarchs of Europe restored the old line of kings  in France. But the country had outgrown despotism. A revolution in 1830  deposed one king and set up another who was ready to rule under the  terms of a constitution. In 1848 this monarchy was displaced and the  second French republic was established. But again a Bonaparte, nephew of  Napoleon I, seized the government and established a second empire,  calling himself Napoleon III. He aped the ways of his great predecessor  and tried by foreign conquest or annexation in Africa, Italy, and Mexico  to dazzle the French people. But he was never popular, and his reign  closed in the defeat and disgrace of the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71),  for which he was partly responsible.    The third French republic was proclaimed in 1870 and is the present  government of the country. Under the constitution there is a senate, the  members of which are elected for nine years, and a lower house, elected  for four years. The president is chosen by these two houses of the  legislature for a term of seven years. No member of the old royal  families may become president of the republic. The president of France  does not possess nearly so much power as the president of the United  States. Many of the executive duties are performed by the premier, or  prime minister, and other cabinet ministers.    Republican France has become one of the great nations of the world, and  its democratic institutions are firmly rooted in the hearts of the  people. It has been compelled to face German militarism by erecting a  system of universal military training. The patriotism and self-sacrifice  of all classes during the Great War have been beyond praise.    GREAT BRITAIN.--During the nineteenth century Great Britain did not  experience any of the sudden revolutions which appeared in nearly every  other country of Europe. For centuries England, Scotland, and Ireland  had possessed representative institutions. When reforms were needed,  they were adopted gradually, by the natural process of lawmaking,  instead of resulting from rebellion and revolt. In this way Great  Britain had been changed from an aristocratic government to one founded  on democratic principles. By 1884 the suffrage was nearly as extensive  as in the United States. Parliament became as truly representative of  the people's will as our American Congress. Far-reaching social reforms  were adopted which advanced the general welfare. Among these reforms  were acts for improving housing conditions, regulating hours of labor  and use of machinery in factories, and establishing a national insurance  system, old-age pensions, and compensation to injured workmen.    Great Britain was the first nation to experience the advantages and  disadvantages of the new age of coal and iron, and the new methods of  factory production. Her wealth and commerce grew at a rapid rate, and  she invested her profits in enterprises in many parts of the world. The  factory system drew so many workers from the farms, that Great Britain  no longer raised sufficient food for her population. She became  dependent upon the United States, Australia, South America, and other  lands for wheat, meat, and other necessaries of life. Her merchant  vessels were to be found in all parts of the world; and her navy was  increased from year to year to protect her commerce and colonies. From  now on it became evident that England's existence depended upon her  ships. If in time of war she lost control of the seas the enemy could  starve her into submission. Hence during the nineteenth century Great  Britain's policy was to maintain a fleet stronger than that of any  possible combination against her.    England's colonial system had been developed into a great empire.  Principles of English liberty and representative government were carried  by Britishers to many parts of the world. The American Revolution showed  the mother country that Englishmen would not brook oppression even by  their own king and parliament. During the nineteenth and twentieth  centuries England adopted the policy of erecting her colonies into  self-governing communities. Thus the separate colonies in Canada, in  Australia, and in South Africa were grouped in each case into a federal  government, somewhat similar to that of the United States, and three  great British democracies were formed within the boundaries of the  empire. So successful has been the British system of colonial government  that there has been virtually no question of loyalty during the Great  War. All parts of the dominions have contributed in men and money to the  common cause, and frequent imperial war conferences have been held in  London. In these conferences representatives from the colonies and the  mother country have joined in the discussion of important imperial  questions.    TURKEY AND THE BALKANS.--In 1453 the Turks captured Constantinople.  Thereafter their power was rapidly extended in southeastern Europe and  for several centuries they were the dominant power in the Balkan  peninsula. During this time they overran Hungary and invaded Austria up  to the walls of Vienna. They subjugated Greece and all the lands now  included in Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Albania, as well as a number of  near-by Austrian, Hungarian, and Russian provinces.    Many diverse races were included within the Turkish dominions. They  differed among themselves in language, religion, and culture. The Turks  were Mohammedans, while their subject peoples in Europe were mainly  Christians belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church.    First driven out of Hungary and Russia during the eighteenth century,  the Turks lost nearly all their European possessions in the nineteenth  and early twentieth centuries. The subject peoples had kept their  national traditions and customs and from time to time they aimed at  independence. The Turkish rule was oppressive and at times its methods  were barbarous. If there had been no jealousies among the great European  powers, it is probable that Russia would have occupied Constantinople  long ago. The other powers, fearing this might make Russia too strong,  interfered on several occasions to prevent such an occupation. But the  powers could not prevent the smaller nationalities from attaining their  independence from Turkey. Greece, Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria, and  Albania were freed from the rule of the \"unspeakable Turk\" and erected  into independent kingdoms at various times between 1829 and 1913. Of her  great empire in Europe, Turkey retained, at the outbreak of the Great  War, an area of less than 11,000 square miles (less than the area of the  state of Maryland), and a population of 1,890,000, "]]]
