It must, however, be remembered that the strength and discipline which  the Assyrian troops possessed in such a high degree, were common to  the military forces of all the great states--Elam, Damascus, Nairi, the  Hittites, and Chaldaea. It was owing to this, and also to the fact that  the armies of all these Powers were, as a rule, both in strength and  numbers, much on a par, that no single state was able to inflict on any  of the rest such a defeat as would end in its destruction. What decisive  results had the terrible struggles produced, which stained almost  periodically the valleys of the Tigris and the Zab with blood? After  endless loss of life and property, they had nearly always issued in the  establishment of the belligerents in their respective possessions,  with possibly the cession of some few small towns or fortresses to the  stronger party, most of which, however, were destined to come back to  its former possessor in the very next campaign. The fall of the capital  itself was not decisive, for it left the vanquished foe chafing under  his losses, while the victory cost his rival so dear that he was unable  to maintain the ascendency for more than a few years. Twice at least  in three centuries a king of Assyria had entered Babylon, and twice the  Babylonians had expelled the intruder of the hour, and had forced him  back with a blare of trumpets to the frontier. Although the Ninevite  dynasties had persisted in their pretensions to a suzerainty which  they had generally been unable to enforce, the tradition of which,  unsupported by any definite decree, had been handed on from one  generation to another; yet in practice their kings had not succeeded in  \"taking the hands of Bel,\" and in reigning personally in Babylon, nor  in extorting from the native sovereign an official acknowledgment of  his vassalage. Profiting doubtless by past experience, Assur-nazir-pal  resolutely avoided those direct conflicts in which so many of his  predecessors had wasted their lives. If he did not actually renounce  his hereditary pretensions, he was content to let them lie dormant. He  preferred to accommodate himself to the terms of the treaty signed a  few years previously by Ramman-nirari, even when Babylon neglected  to observe them; he closed his eyes to the many ill-disguised acts of  hostility to which he was exposed,* and devoted all his energies to  dealing with less dangerous enemies.         * He did not make the presence of Cossoan troops among the       allies of the Sukhi a casus belli, even though they were       commanded by a brother and by one of the principal officers       of the King of Babylon.    Even if his frontier touched Karduniash to the south, elsewhere he was  separated from the few states strong enough to menace his kingdom by  a strip of varying width, comprising several less important tribes and  cities;--to the east and north-east by the barbarians of obscure race  whose villages and strongholds were scattered along the upper affluents  of the Tigris or on the lower terraces of the Iranian plateau: to the  west and north-west by the principalities and nomad tribes, mostly of  Aramoan extraction, who now for a century had peopled the mountains  of the Tigris and the steppes of Mesopotamia. They were high-spirited,  warlike, hardy populations, proud of their independence and quick  to take up arms in its defence or for its recovery, but none of them  possessed more than a restricted domain, or had more than a handful  of soldiers at its disposal. At times, it is true, the nature of their  locality befriended them, and the advantages of position helped to  compensate for their paucity of numbers.    [Illustration: 017.jpg THE ESCARPMENTS OF THE ZAB]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. Binder.    Sometimes they were entrenched behind one of those rapid watercourses  like the Radanu, the Zab, or the Turnat, which are winter torrents  rather than streams, and are overhung by steep banks, precipitous as a  wall above a moat; sometimes they took refuge upon some wooded height  and awaited attack amid its rocks and pine woods. Assyria was  superior to all of them, if not in the valour of its troops, at least  numerically, and, towering in the midst of them, she could single out  at will whichever tribe offered the easiest prey, and falling on it  suddenly, would crush it by sheer force of weight. In such a case the  surrounding tribes, usually only too well pleased to witness in safety  the fall of a dangerous rival, would not attempt to interfere; but their  turn was ere long sure to come, and the pity which they had declined  to show to their neighbours was in like manner refused to them. The  Assyrians ravaged their country, held their chiefs to ransom, razed  their strongholds, or, when they did not demolish them, garrisoned  them with their own troops who held sway over the country. The revenues  gleaned from these conquests would swell the treasury at Nineveh, the  native soldiers would be incorporated into the Assyrian army, and when  the smaller tribes had all in turn been subdued, their conqueror would,  at length, find himself confronted with one of the great states from  which he had been separated by these buffer communities; then it was  that the men and money he had appropriated in his conquests would  embolden him to provoke or accept battle with some tolerable certainty  of victory.    Immediately on his accession, Assur-nazir-pal turned his attention to  the parts of his frontier where the population was most scattered, and  therefore less able to offer any resistance to his projects.*         * The principal document for the history of Assur-nazir-pal       is the \"Monolith of Nimrud,\" discovered by Layard in the       ruins of the temple of Ninip; it bears the same inscription       on both its sides. It is a compilation of various documents,       comprising, first, a consecutive account of the campaigns of       the king's first six years, terminating in a summary of the       results obtained during that period; secondly, the account       of the campaign of his sixth year, followed by three       campaigns not dated, the last of which was in Syria; and       thirdly, the history of a last campaign, that of his       eighteenth year, and a second summary. A monolith found in       the ruins of Kurkh, at some distance from Diarbekir,       contains some important additions to the account of the       campaigns of the fifth year. The other numerous inscriptions       of Assur-nazir-pal which have come down to us do not contain       any information of importance which is not found in the text       of the Annals. The inscription of the broken Obelisk, from       which I have often quoted, contains in the second column       some mention of the works undertaken by this king.    He marched towards the north-western point of his territory, suddenly  invaded Nummi,* and in an incredibly short time took Gubbe, its capital,  and some half-dozen lesser places, among them Surra, Abuku, Arura,  and Arubi. The inhabitants assembled upon a mountain ridge which they  believed to be inaccessible, its peak being likened to \"the point of an  iron dagger,\" and the steepness of its sides such that \"no winged bird  of the heavens dare venture on them.\" In the short space of three days  Assur-nazir-pal succeeded in climbing its precipices and forcing the  entrenchments which had been thrown up on its summit: two hundred of its  defenders perished sword in hand, the remainder were taken prisoners.  The Kirruri,** terrified by this example, submitted unreservedly to  the conqueror, yielded him their horses, mules, oxen, sheep, wine, and  brazen vessels, and accepted the Assyrian prefects appointed to collect  the tribute.         * Nummi or Nimmi, mentioned already in the Annals of       Tiglath-pileser I., has been placed by Hommel in the       mountain group which separates Lake Van from Lake Urumiah,       but by Tiele in the regions situated to the southeast of       Nineveh; the observations of Delattre show that we ought       perhaps to look for it to the north of the Arzania,       certainly in the valley of that river. It appears to me to       answer to the cazas of Varto and Boulanik in the sandjak of       Mush. The name of the capital may be identified with the       present Gop, chief town of the caza of Boulanik; in this       case Abuku might be represented by the village of Biyonkh.         ** The Kirruri must have had their habitat in the depression       around Lake frumiah, on the western side of the lake, if we       are to believe Schrader; Jelattre has pointed out that it       ought to be sought elsewhere, near the sources of the       Tigris, not far from the Murad-su. The connection in which       it is here cited obliges us to place it in the immediate       neighbourhood of Nummi, and its relative position to Adaush       and Gilzan makes it probable that it is to be sought to the       west and south-west of Lake Van, in the cazas of Mush and       Sassun in the sandjak of Mush.    The neighbouring districts, Adaush, Gilzan, and Khubushkia, followed  their example;* they sent the king considerable presents of gold,  silver, lead, and copper, and their alacrity in buying off their  conqueror saved them from the ruinous infliction of a garrison. The  Assyrian army defiling through the pass of Khulun next fell upon the  Kirkhi, dislodged the troops stationed in the fortress of Nishtun,  and pillaged the cities of Khatu, Khatara, Irbidi, Arzania, Tela, and  Khalua; ** Bubu, the Chief of Nishtun,*** was sent to Arbela, flayed  alive, and his skin nailed to the city wall.         * Kirzau, also transcribed Gilzan and Guzan, has been       relegated by the older Assyriologists to Eastern Armenia,       and the site further specified as being between the ancient       Araxes and Lake Urumiah, in the Persian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"with all probability to identify him       with Eth-baal.    Twenty years later Shalmaneser III. had returned to Syria, and had come  into conflict with Damascus. The northern Phoenicians formed a league  with Ben-hadad (Adadidri) to withstand him, and drew upon themselves the  penalty of their rashness; the Tynans, faithful to their usual policy,  preferred to submit voluntarily and purchase peace. Their conduct  showed the greater wisdom in that, after the death of Eth-baal, internal  troubles again broke out with renewed fierceness and with even more  disastrous results. His immediate successor was Balezor (854-846 B.C.),  followed by Mutton I. (845-821 B.C.), who flung himself at the feet of  Shalmaneser III., in 842 B.c., in the camp at Baalirasi, and renewed  his homage three years later, in 839 B.C. The legends concerning the  foundation of Carthage blend with our slight knowledge of his history.  They attribute to Mutton I. a daughter named Elissa, who was married  to her uncle Sicharbal, high priest of Melkarth, and a young son named  Pygmalion (820-774 B.c.). Sicharbal had been nominated by Mutton as  regent during the minority of Pygmalion, but he was overthrown by  the people, and some years later murdered by his ward. From that time  forward Elissa's one aim was to avenge the murder of her husband.  She formed a conspiracy which was joined by all the nobles, but being  betrayed and threatened with death, she seized a fleet which lay ready  to sail in the harbour, and embarking with all her adherents set sail  for Africa, landing in the district of Zeugitane, where the Sidonians  had already built Kambe. There she purchased a tract of land from  larbas, chief of the Liby-phoenicians, and built on the ruins of the  ancient factory a new town, Qart-hadshat, which the Greeks called  Carchedo and the Romans Carthage. The genius of Virgil has rendered  the name of Dido illustrious: but history fails to recognise in the  narratives which form the basis of his tale anything beyond a legendary  account fabricated after the actual origin (814-813 B.C.) of the great  Punic city had been forgotten. Thus weakened, Tyre could less than ever  think of opposing the ambitious designs of Assyria: Pygmalion took no  part in the rebellions of the petty Syrian kings against Samsi-ramman,  and in 803 B.C. he received his suzerain Ramman-nirari with the  accustomed gifts, when that king passed through Phoenicia before  attacking Damascus. Pygmalion died about 774 B.C., and the names of his  immediate successors are not known;* it may be supposed, however, that  when the power of Nineveh temporarily declined, the ties which held Tyre  to Assyria became naturally relaxed, and the city released herself from  the burden of a tribute which had in the past been very irregularly  paid.         * The fragment of Menander 'which has preserved for us the       list of Tyrian kings from Abi-baal to Pygmalion, was only       quoted by Josephus, because, the seventh year of Pygmalion's       reign corresponding to the date of the foundation of       Carthage,--814--813 B.C. according to the chronological       system of Timssus,--the Hebrew historian found in it a fixed       date which seemed to permit of his establishing the       chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah on a trustworthy       basis between the reign of Pygmalion and Hiram I., the       contemporary of David and Solomon.    The yoke was reassumed half a century later, at the mere echo of the  first victories of Tiglath-pileser III.; and Hiram II., who then reigned  in Tyre, hastened to carry to the camp at Arpad assurances of his  fidelity (742 B.C.). He gave pledges of his allegiance once more in 738  B.C.; then he disappears, and Mutton II. takes his place about 736 B.C.  This king cast off, unhappily for himself, his hereditary apathy, and as  soon as a pretext offered itself, abandoned the policy of neutrality to  which his ancestors had adhered so firmly. He entered into an alliance  in 734 B.C. with Damascus, Israel and Philistia, secretly supported  and probably instigated by Egypt; then, when Israel was conquered and  Damascus overthrown, he delayed repairing his error till an Assyrian  army appeared before Tyre: he had then to pay the price of his temerity  by 120 talents of gold and many loads of merchandise (728 B.C.). The  punishment was light and the loss inconsiderable in comparison with  the accumulated wealth of the city, which its maritime trade was daily  increasing:* Mutton thought the episode was closed,** but the peaceful  policy of his house, having been twice interrupted, could not be  resumed.         *[For a description of the trade carried on by Tyre, cf.       Ezelc. xxvi., xxvii., and xxviii.---Tr.]         ** Pygmalion having died about 774 B.C., and Hiram II. not       appearing till 742 B.C., it is probable that we should       intercalate between these two Kings at least one sovereign       whose name is still unknown.    Southern Phoenicia, having once launched on the stream of Asiatic  politics, followed its fluctuations, and was compelled henceforth to  employ in her own defence the forces which had hitherto been utilised  in promoting her colonial enterprises. But it was not due to the foolish  caprice of ignorant or rash sovereigns that Tyre renounced her former  neutral policy: she was constrained to do so, almost perforce, by the  changes which had taken place in Europe. The progress of the Greeks, and  their triumph in the waters of the AEgean and Ionian Seas, and the rapid  expansion of the Etruscan navy after the end of the ninth century, had  gradually restricted the Phoenician merchantmen to the coasts of the  Western Mediterranean and the Atlantic: they industriously exploited  the mineral wealth of Africa and Spain, and traffic with the barbarous  tribes of Morocco and Lusitania, as well as the discovery and working of  the British tin mines, had largely compensated for the losses occasioned  by the closing of the Greek and Italian markets. Their ships, obliged  now to coast along the inhospitable cliffs of Northern Africa and to  face the open sea, were more strongly and scientifically built than any  vessels hitherto constructed. The Egyptian undecked galleys, with stem  and stern curving inwards, were discarded as a build ill adapted to  resist the attacks of wind or wave. The new Phoenician galley had a long,  low, narrow, well-balanced hull, the stern raised and curving inwards  above the steersman, as heretofore, but the bows pointed and furnished  with a sharp ram projecting from the keel, equally serviceable to cleave  the waves or to stave in the side of an enemy's ship. Motive power was  supplied by two banks of oars, the upper ones resting in rowlocks on  the gunwale, the lower ones in rowlocks pierced in the timbers of the  vessel's side. An upper deck, supported by stout posts, ran from stem to  stern, above the heads of the rowers, and was reserved for the soldiers  and the rest of the crew: on a light railing surrounding it were hung  the circular shields of the former, forming as it were a rampart on  either side.    [Illustration: 017.jpg A PHOENICIAN GALLEY WITH TWO BANKS OF OARS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard. Sennacherib affirms       that vessels of this type had been constructed by Syrian       shipwrights, and were manned by Tyrian, Sidonian, and Ionian       sailors.    The mast, passing through both decks, was firmly fixed in the keel, and  was supported by two stays made fast to stem and stern. The rectangular  sail was attached to a yard which could be hoisted or lowered at will.  The wealth which accrued to the Tyrians from their naval expeditions  had rendered the superiority of Tyre over the neighbouring cities so  manifest that they had nearly all become her vassals. Arvad and Northern  Phoenicia were still independent, as also the sacred city of Bylos, but  the entire coast from the Nahr-el-Kelb to the headland formed by  Mount Carmel was directly subject to Tyre,* comprising the two Sidons,  Bit-ziti, and Sarepta, the country from Mahalliba to the fords of the  Litany, Ushu and its hinterland as far as Kana, Akzib, Akko, and Dora;  and this compact territory, partly protected by the range of Lebanon,  and secured by the habitual prudence of its rulers from the invasions  which had desolated Syria, formed the most flourishing, and perhaps also  the most populous, kingdom which still existed between the Euphrates and  the Egyptian desert.**         * The kings of Arvad and Byblos are still found mentioned at       the beginning of Sennacherib's reign.         ** The extent of the kingdom of Tyro is indicated by the       passage in which Sennacherib enumerated the cities which he       had taken from Elulai. To these must be added Dor, to the       south of Carmel, which was always regarded as belonging to       the Tyrians, and whose isolated position between the       headland, the sea, and the forest might cause the Assyrians       to leave it unmolested.    Besides these, some parts of Cyprus were dependent on Tyre, though  the Achaean colonies, continually reinforced by fresh immigrants, had  absorbed most of the native population and driven the rest into the  mountains.    [Illustration: 018.jpg MAP OF KINGDOM OF TYRE, THE CAMPAIGN OF  SENNACHERIB]    A hybrid civilisation had developed among these early Greek settlers,  amalgamating the customs, religions, and arts of the ancient eastern  world of Egypt, Syria, and Chaldoa in variable proportions: their script  was probably derived from one of the Asianic systems whose monuments  are still but partly known, and it consisted of a syllabary awkwardly  adapted to a language for which it had not been designed. A dozen petty  kings, of whom the majority were Greeks, disputed possession of the  northern and eastern parts of the island, at Idalion, Khytros, Paphos,  Soli, Kourion, Tamassos, and Ledron.
