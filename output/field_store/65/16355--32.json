Intellectually they were until recently, and to a large extent  still are, non-progressive, in bondage to uniformity and mechanism  in culture, imitative, unimaginative, torpid, indirect, suspicious,  and superstitious.    The character is being modified by intercourse with other peoples  of the earth and by the strong force of physical, intellectual,  and moral education.      Marriage in Early Times    Certain parts of the marriage ceremonial of China as now existing  indicate that the original form of marriage was by capture--of which,  indeed, there is evidence in the classical _Book of Odes_. But a  regular form of marriage (in reality a contract of sale) is shown  to have existed in the earliest historical times. The form was not  monogamous, though it seems soon to have assumed that of a qualified  monogamy consisting of one wife and one or more concubines, the  number of the latter being as a rule limited only by the means of the  husband. The higher the rank the larger was the number of concubines  and handmaids in addition to the wife proper, the palaces of the  kings and princes containing several hundreds of them. This form it  has retained to the present day, though associations now exist for  the abolition of concubinage. In early times, as well as throughout  the whole of Chinese history, concubinage was in fact universal,  and there is some evidence also of polyandry (which, however, cannot  have prevailed to any great extent). The age for marriage was twenty  for the man and fifteen for the girl, celibacy after thirty and twenty  respectively being officially discouraged. In the province of Shantung  it was usual for the wives to be older than their husbands. The  parents' consent to the betrothal was sought through the intervention  of a matchmaker, the proposal originating with the parents, and  the wishes of the future bride and bridegroom not being taken into  consideration. The conclusion of the marriage was the progress of the  bride from the house of her parents to that of the bridegroom, where  after various ceremonies she and he worshipped his ancestors together,  the worship amounting to little more than an announcement of the union  to the ancestral spirits. After a short sojourn with her husband the  bride revisited her parents, and the marriage was not considered as  finally consummated until after this visit had taken place.    The status of women was low, and the power of the husband great--so  great that he could kill his wife with impunity. Divorce was common,  and all in favour of the husband, who, while he could not be  divorced by her, could put his wife away for disobedience or even  for loquaciousness. A widower remarried immediately, but refusal  to remarry by a widow was esteemed an act of chastity. She often  mutilated herself or even committed suicide to prevent remarriage,  and was posthumously honoured for doing so. Being her husband's as  much in the Otherworld as in this, remarriage would partake of the  character of unchastity and insubordination; the argument, of course,  not applying to the case of the husband, who by remarriage simply  adds another member to his clan without infringing on anyone's rights.      Marriage in Monarchical and Republican Periods    The marital system of the early classical times, of which the above  were the essentials, changed but little during the long period of  monarchical rule lasting from 221 B.C. to A.D. 1912. The principal  object, as before, was to secure an heir to sacrifice to the spirits of  deceased progenitors. Marriage was not compulsory, but old bachelors  and old maids were very scarce. The concubines were subject to the  wife, who was considered to be the mother of their children as well  as her own. Her status, however, was not greatly superior. Implicit  obedience was exacted from her. She could not possess property, but  could not be hired out for prostitution. The latter vice was common,  in spite of the early age at which marriage took place and in spite  of the system of concubinage--which is after all but a legalized  transfer of prostitutional cohabitation to the domestic circle.    Since the establishment of the Republic in 1912 the 'landslide' in the  direction of Western progress has had its effect also on the domestic  institutions. But while the essentials of the marriage contract remain  practically the same as before, the most conspicuous changes have been  in the accompanying ceremonial--now sometimes quite foreign, but in a  very large, perhaps the greatest, number of cases that odious thing,  half foreign, half Chinese; as, for instance, when the procession,  otherwise native, includes foreign glass-panelled carriages, or the  bridegroom wears a 'bowler' or top-hat with his Chinese dress--and  in the greater freedom allowed to women, who are seen out of doors  much more than formerly, sit at table with their husbands, attend  public functions and dinners, dress largely in foreign fashion,  and play tennis and other games, instead of being prisoners of the  'inner apartment' and household drudges little better than slaves.    One unexpected result of this increased freedom is certainly  remarkable, and is one not likely to have been predicted by the most  far-sighted sociologist. Many of the 'progressive' Chinese, now that  it is the fashion for Chinese wives to be seen in public with their  husbands, finding the uneducated, _gauche_, small-footed household  drudge unable to compete with the smarter foreign-educated wives  of their neighbours, have actually repudiated them and taken unto  themselves spouses whom they can exhibit in public without 'loss  of face'! It is, however, only fair to add that the total number  of these cases, though by no means inconsiderable, appears to be  proportionately small.      Parents and Children    As was the power of the husband over the wife, so was that of the  father over his children. Infanticide (due chiefly to poverty,  and varying with it) was frequent, especially in the case of female  children, who were but slightly esteemed; the practice prevailing  extensively in three or four provinces, less extensively in others,  and being practically absent in a large number. Beyond the fact that  some penalties were enacted against it by the Emperor Ch'ien Lung  (A.D. 1736-96), and that by statute it was a capital offence to murder  children in order to use parts of their bodies for medicine, it was  not legally prohibited. When the abuse became too scandalous in any  district proclamations condemning it would be issued by the local  officials. A man might, by purchase and contract, adopt a person  as son, daughter, or grandchild, such person acquiring thereby all  the rights of a son or daughter. Descent, both of real and personal  property, was to all the sons of wives and concubines as joint heirs,  irrespective of seniority. Bastards received half shares. Estates were  not divisible by the children during the lifetime of their parents  or grandparents.    The head of the family being but the life-renter of the family  property, bound by fixed rules, wills were superfluous, and were used  only where the customary respect for the parents gave them a voice  in arranging the details of the succession. For this purpose verbal  or written instructions were commonly given.    In the absence of the father, the male relatives of the same surname  assumed the guardianship of the young. The guardian exercised full  authority and enjoyed the surplus revenues of his ward's estate,  but might not alienate the property.    There are many instances in Chinese history of extreme devotion of  children to parents taking the form of self-wounding and even of  suicide in the hope of curing parents' illnesses or saving their lives.      Political History    The country inhabited by the Chinese on their arrival from the West  was, as we saw, the district where the modern provinces of Shansi,  Shensi, and Honan join. This they extended in an easterly direction  to the shores of the Gulf of Chihli--a stretch of territory about 600  miles long by 300 broad. The population, as already stated, was between  one and two millions. During the first two thousand years of their  known history the boundaries of this region were not greatly enlarged,  but beyond the more or less undefined borderland to the south were  _chou_ or colonies, nuclei of Chinese population, which continually  increased in size through conquest of the neighbouring territory. In  221 B.C. all the feudal states into which this territory had been  parcelled out, and which fought with one another, were subjugated  and absorbed by the state of Ch'in, which in that year instituted the  monarchical form of government--the form which obtained in China for  the next twenty-one centuries.    Though the origin of the name 'China' has not yet been finally decided,  the best authorities regard it as derived from the name of this feudal  state of Ch'in.    Under this short-lived dynasty of Ch'in and the famous Han dynasty  (221 B.C. to A.D. 221) which followed it, the Empire expanded until  it embraced almost all the territory now known as China Proper  (the Eighteen Provinces of Manchu times). To these were added  in order between 194 B.C. and A.D. 1414: Corea, Sinkiang (the  New Territory or Eastern Turkestan), Manchuria, Formosa, Tibet,  and Mongolia--Formosa and Corea being annexed by Japan in 1895 and  1910 respectively. Numerous other extra-China countries and islands,  acquired and lost during the long course of Chinese history (at one  time, from 73 to 48 B.C., \"all Asia from Japan to the Caspian Sea was  tributary to the Middle Kingdom,\" _i.e._ China), it is not necessary  to mention here.

Thirdly, the deepest conviction of Hindus in all ages is that salvation  and happiness are attainable by knowledge. The corresponding phrases in  Sanskrit are perhaps less purely intellectual than our word and contain  some idea of effort and emotion. He who knows God attains to God, nay he  is God. Rites and self-denial are but necessary preliminaries to such  knowledge: he who possesses it stands above them. It is inconceivable to  the Hindus that he should care for the things of the world but he cares  equally little for creeds and ceremonies. Hence, side by side with  irksome codes, complicated ritual and elaborate theology, we find the  conviction that all these things are but vanity and weariness, fetters  to be shaken off by the free in spirit. Nor do those who hold such views  correspond to the anti-clerical and radical parties of Europe. The  ascetic sitting in the temple court often holds that the rites performed  around him are spiritually useless and the gods of the shrine mere  fanciful presentments of that which cannot be depicted or described.    Rather later, but still before the Christian era, another idea makes  itself prominent in Indian religion, namely faith or devotion to a  particular deity. This idea, which needs no explanation, is pushed on  the one hand to every extreme of theory and practice: on the other it  rarely abolishes altogether the belief in ritualism, asceticism and  knowledge.    Any attempt to describe Hinduism as one whole leads to startling  contrasts. The same religion enjoins self-mortification and orgies:  commands human sacrifices and yet counts it a sin to eat meat or crush  an insect: has more priests, rites and images than ancient Egypt or  medieval Rome and yet out does Quakers in rejecting all externals. These  singular features are connected with the ascendancy of the Brahman  caste. The Brahmans are an interesting social phenomenon without exact  parallel elsewhere. They are not, like the Catholic or Moslem clergy, a  priesthood pledged to support certain doctrines but an intellectual,  hereditary aristocracy who claim to direct the thought of India whatever  forms it may take. All who admit this claim and accord a nominal  recognition to the authority of the Veda are within the spacious fold or  menagerie. Neither the devil-worshipping aboriginee nor the atheistic  philosopher is excommunicated, though neither may be relished by average  orthodoxy.    Though Hinduism has no one creed, yet there are at least two doctrines  held by nearly all who call themselves Hindus. One may be described as  polytheistic pantheism. Most Hindus are apparently polytheists, that is  to say they venerate the images of several deities or spirits, yet most  are monotheists in the sense that they address their worship to one god.  But this monotheism has almost always a pantheistic tinge. The Hindu  does not say the gods of the heathen are but idols, but it is the Lord  who made the heavens: he says, My Lord (Rama, Krishna or whoever it may  be) is all the other gods. Some schools would prefer to say that no  human language applied to the Godhead can be correct and that all ideas  of a personal ruler of the world are at best but relative truths. This  ultimate ineffable Godhead is called Brahman[7].    The second doctrine is commonly known as metempsychosis, the  transmigration of souls or reincarnation, the last name being the most  correct. In detail the doctrine assumes various forms since different  views are held about the relation of soul to body. But the essence of  all is the same, namely that a life does not begin at birth or end at  death but is a link in an infinite series of lives, each of which is  conditioned and determined by the acts done in previous existences  (karma). Animal, human and divine (or at least angelic) existences may  all be links in the chain. A man's deeds, if good, may exalt him to the  heavens, if evil may degrade him to life as a beast. Since all lives,  even in heaven, must come to an end, happiness is not to be sought in  heaven or on earth. The common aspiration of the religious Indian is for  deliverance, that is release from the round of births and repose in some  changeless state called by such names as union with Brahman, nirvana and  many others.      3. _The Buddha_    As observed above, the Brahmans claim to direct the religious life and  thought of India and apart from Mohammedanism may be said to have  achieved their ambition, though at the price of tolerating much that the  majority would wish to suppress. But in earlier ages their influence was  less extensive and there were other currents of religious activity, some  hostile and some simply independent. The most formidable of these found  expression in Jainism and Buddhism both of which arose in Bihar in the  sixth century[8] B.C. This century was a time of intellectual ferment in  many countries. In China it produced Lao-tz[u] and Confucius: in Greece,  Parmenides, Empedocles, and the sophists were only a little later. In  all these regions we have the same phenomenon of restless, wandering  teachers, ready to give advice on politics, religion or philosophy, to  any one who would hear them.    At that time the influence of the Brahmans had hardly permeated Bihar,  though predominant to the west of it, and speculation there followed  lines different from those laid down in the Upanishads, but of some  antiquity, for we know that there were Buddhas before Gotama and that  Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, reformed the doctrine of an older  teacher called Parsva.    In Gotama's youth Bihar was full of wandering philosophers who appear to  have been atheistic and disposed to uphold the boldest paradoxes,  intellectual and moral. There must however have been constructive  elements in their doctrine, for they believed in reincarnation and the  periodic appearance of superhuman teachers and in the advantage of  following an ascetic discipline. They probably belonged chiefly to the  warrior caste as did Gotama, the Buddha known to history. The Pitakas  represent him as differing in details from contemporary teachers but as  rediscovering the truth taught by his predecessors. They imply that the  world is so constituted that there is only one way to emancipation and  that from time to time superior minds see this and announce it to  others. Still Buddhism does not in practice use such formulae as living  in harmony with the laws of nature.    Indian literature is notoriously concerned with ideas rather than facts  but the vigorous personality of the Buddha has impressed on it a  portrait more distinct than that left by any other teacher or king. His  work had a double effect. Firstly it influenced all departments of Hindu  religion and thought, even those nominally opposed to it. Secondly it  spread not only Buddhism in the strict sense but Indian art and  literature beyond the confines of India. The expansion of Hindu culture  owes much to the doctrine that the Good Law should be preached to all  nations.    The teaching of Gotama was essentially practical. This statement may  seem paradoxical to the reader who has some acquaintance with the  Buddhist scriptures and he will exclaim that of all religious books they  are the least practical and least popular: they set up an anti-social  ideal and are mainly occupied with psychological theories. But the  Buddha addressed a public such as we now find it hard even to imagine.  In those days the intellectual classes of India felt the ordinary  activities of life to be unsatisfying: they thought it natural to  renounce the world and mortify the flesh: divergent systems of ritual,  theology and self-denial promised happiness but all agreed in thinking  it normal as well as laudable that a man should devote his life to  meditation and study. Compared with this frame of mind the teaching of  the Buddha is not unsocial, unpractical and mysterious but human,  business-like and clear. We are inclined to see in the monastic life  which he recommended little but a useless sacrifice but it is evident  that in the opinion of his contemporaries his disciples had an easy  time, and that he had no intention of prescribing any cramped or  unnatural existence. He accepted the current conviction that those who  devote themselves to the things of the mind and spirit should be  released from worldly ties and abstain from luxury but he meant his  monks to live a life of sustained intellectual activity for themselves  and of benevolence for others. His teaching is formulated in severe and  technical phraseology, yet the substance of it is so simple that many  have criticized it as too obvious and jejune to be the basis of a  religion. But when he first enunciated his theses some two thousand five  hundred years ago, they were not obvious but revolutionary and little  less than paradoxical.    The principal of these propositions are as follows. The existence of  everything depends on a cause: hence if the cause of evil or suffering  can be detected and removed, evil itself will be removed. That cause is  lust and craving for pleasure[9]. Hence all sacrificial and sacramental  religions are irrelevant, for the cure which they propose has nothing to  do with the disease. The cause of evil or suffering is removed by  purifying the heart and by following the moral law which sets high value  on sympathy and social duties, but an equally high value on the  cultivation of individual character. But training and cultivation imply  the possibility of change. Hence it is a fatal mistake in the religious  life to hold a view common in India which regards the essence of man as  something unchangeable and happy in itself, if it can only be isolated  from physical trammels. On the contrary the happy mind is something to  be built up by good thoughts, good words and good deeds. In its origin  the Buddha's celebrated doctrine that there is no"]]]
