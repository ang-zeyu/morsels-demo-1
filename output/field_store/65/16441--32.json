She was, we are told, exceedingly affectionate,  very full of high spirits, fond of life in the open air, and already  possessed a strong sense of duty and religion.    She had been taught by her devoted uncle Leopold, with whom she  corresponded regularly, how necessary it was for her to understand  thoroughly the duties which fall to the share of a ruler. During the  years which followed she went more into society and paid visits to  the most interesting places in the kingdom. Everywhere she went she  was received with the greatest enthusiasm.    In 1830 the Duke of Coburg, with his two sons, Ernest and Albert,  arrived at Kensington Palace on a visit, and thus the Princess met  for the first time her future husband. Her uncle Leopold had long  desired to carry out the cherished wish of his mother, the Dowager  Duchess of Coburg, that the two cousins should be united in marriage.  During William the Fourth's lifetime all mention of such a marriage  had to be kept secret, as the King much disliked the Coburg family,  and had more than once been very rude to the Duchess of Kent.    Victoria wrote to her uncle saying how much she liked Albert in every  way, and that he possessed every quality that could be desired to  render her perfectly happy. She was very anxious that her uncle  should take her cousin under his special protection.    On May 24, 1837, Victoria attained her majority. She received numbers  of magnificent presents, congratulations from public bodies, and in  the evening a State Ball was given at St James's Palace.    On Tuesday, June 20 of that year, at twelve minutes past two, King  William the Fourth died. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord  Chamberlain set out at once for Kensington to convey the sad news.  They arrived at five in the morning, and were told that the Princess  was asleep. They replied that they were on important business of  State to the Queen, and even her sleep must give way to that. Our  illustration depicts the scene which then ensued.    [Illustration: The Announcement of the Queen's Accession by the  Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chancellor  H.T. Wells, R.A.  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    Even during the first days of her reign, the Queen's dignity, calm,  and knowledge of State affairs astonished her ministers, and were  complete proof of the careful training she had received during her  girlhood days. Greville, Clerk to the Council, wrote: \"She presided  with as much ease as if she had been doing nothing else all her  life. . . . The gracefulness of her manner and the good expression  of her countenance give her on the whole a very agreeable appearance,  and with her youth inspire an excessive interest in all who approach  her, and which I can't help feeling myself.\"    In July the Queen and her mother left their home to take up their  residence in Buckingham Palace, formerly known as the Queen's House.  The present palace occupies the site of Buckingham House, which was  erected by John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, in 1703. It was bought  by George the Third for his wife in 1761, remodelled by George the  Fourth, and completed by William the Fourth, who, however, had never  lived there.    Four days later the Queen went in State to dissolve Parliament, and  soon afterward removed to Windsor Castle, where she was joined for  a time by her uncle and his wife.    Prince Albert wrote her a warm letter of congratulation. \"You are  now,\" he said, \"Queen of the mightiest land in Europe. In your hands  lie the happiness of millions. May Heaven assist and strengthen you  with its strength in that high but difficult task! I hope that your  reign may be long, happy, and glorious, and that your efforts may  be rewarded by the thankfulness and love of your subjects.\"    On Thursday, June 28, 1838, the coronation ceremony took place in  Westminster Abbey. Afterward the Queen made a royal progress and was  greeted by immense crowds of her people with the utmost loyalty and  enthusiasm. In her journal she described it as the proudest day of  her life. Mrs Jamieson, an onlooker, wrote of her as follows:    \"When she returned, looking pale and tremulous, crowned and holding  her sceptre in a manner and attitude which said, 'I have it, and none  shall wrest it from me,' even Carlyle, who was standing near me,  uttered with emotion, 'A blessing on her head!'\"    As a small instance of the Queen's consideration for others, one of  her first thoughts after the ceremony was for the school-children.  She wrote to her minister, Lord Melbourne, asking if it was not usual  to give a week's additional holiday to the schools on such an occasion  as this.    Lord Melbourne was from the moment of her accession the Queen's chief  adviser, and from the many letters which passed between them it is  extremely interesting to see with what affection the young and  inexperienced girl regarded him. \"He is not only a clever statesman  and an honest man,\" she wrote to her uncle, Leopold, \"but a good and  a kind-hearted man, whose aim is to do his duty for his country and  not for a _party_.\"    Lord Melbourne was almost a second father to her, and there is no  doubt that it was largely due to his excellent and homely advice that  the Queen was able during the early years of her reign to develop  in such an astonishing manner and yet at the same time to retain such  a sweet and womanly character. Of her regularity of life and careful  attention to detail we learn from Greville's diary. She rose soon  after eight o'clock, and after breakfast was occupied with business  the whole morning. During this time Lord Melbourne visited her  regularly. At two o'clock she rode out, attended by her suite, and  amused herself afterward for the rest of the afternoon with music,  singing, or romps with children. Dinner was served at eight o'clock  to the whole household, and the Queen usually retired soon after  eleven. \"She orders and regulates every detail herself; she knows  where everybody is lodged in the Castle, settles about the riding  or driving, and enters into every particular with minute attention.\"  She never signed a single document of any importance until she had  thoroughly mastered its contents.    In October, 1839, her cousins Ernest and Albert paid her a visit,  bringing with them a letter from their uncle Leopold, in which he  recommended them to her care. They were at once upon intimate terms,  and the Queen confided to her uncle that \"Albert was very  fascinating.\" Four days after their arrival she informed Lord  Melbourne that she had made up her mind as to the question of marriage.  He received the news in a very kindly manner and said: \"I think it  will be very well received, for I hear that there is an anxiety now  that it should be, and I am very glad of it. You will be much more  comfortable, for a woman cannot stand alone for any time, in whatever  position she may be.\"    The Queen described her betrothal as follows: \"At half-past twelve  I sent for Albert. He came to the closet, where I was alone, and after  a few minutes I said to him that I thought he would be aware why I  wished him to come, and that it would make me happy if he would consent  to what I wished, namely, to marry me. There was no hesitation on  his part, but the offer was received with the greatest demonstrations  of kindness and affection. . . . I told him I was quite unworthy of  him. . . . He said he would be very happy to spend his life with me.\"    She wrote to her uncle: \"I _love_ him _more_ than I can say, and I  shall do everything in my power to render the sacrifice he has made  (for a sacrifice in my opinion it is) as small as I can.\"    In the following November the news was made public, but it was not  received with any great enthusiasm, as a German alliance was  unpopular. There were other suitors for the Queen's hand, and the  majority would have preferred one of her English cousins to have been  chosen.    On February 10, 1840, the marriage was solemnized at the Chapel Royal,  St James's. The Queen was described by those who saw her as looking  extremely happy, and to her uncle she wrote of her delight at seeing  the huge crowds which lined the streets to see the procession pass.  \"God grant that I may be the happy person, the _most_ happy person,  to make this dearest, blessed being happy and contented! What is in  my power to make him happy, I will do.\"          CHAPTER IV: _Husband and Wife_      After four short days the Queen and her husband returned to London,  and from this time onward the Prince acted as his wife's secretary,  attending to every little detail of the mass of correspondence and  State documents which grew larger with every succeeding year.    All the letters received by the Queen during the course of a long  and busy life-time were carefully preserved, and at her death they  amounted to no fewer than five or six hundred large bound volumes.  They include letters from crowned heads of Europe, from her ministers  of State, from her children, and from her friends and relations.    All these the Queen read and answered. She was thus at all times fully  aware of everything that was happening both at home and abroad, and  in her great Empire, an Empire which was destined to grow greater  and greater in power and extent during her reign. Day by day, year  in, year out, without a single break, this immense correspondence  arrived. Ministers resigned and ministers were appointed, but there  was neither halt nor rest. Truly 'the burden of Empire' is heavy for  those who bear it.    The young Prince determined from the first to master both national  and European politics, for it must always be remembered that as he  was a foreigner everything in this country was for some time strange  to him. In addition to being his wife's right hand he took a leading  part in all movements which might help to improve the education and  conditions of life of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#3)"],[1,"is sufficient to let a  carriage pass. Portholes are cut at intervals of twelve yards, so  contrived that the gunners are safe from the shot of any possible  assailants. At the end of one of the galleries hollowed out in a  prominent part of the cliff is St. George's Hall, 50 feet long by 85  feet wide, in which the governor was accustomed to give fetes.  Alterations, extensions, and improvements are continually taking place  in the defensive system, and new guns of the most formidable sort are  gradually displacing or supplementing the old fashioned ordnance.    The whole population of Gibraltar, whether civil or military, is  subjected to certain stringent rules. For even a day's sojourn the  alien must obtain a pass from the town major, and if he wish to remain  longer, a consul or householder must become security for his good  behavior. Licenses of residence are granted only for short  periods--ten, fifteen, or twenty days--but they can be renewed if  occasion require. Military officers may introduce a stranger for  thirty days. A special permit is necessary if the visitor wishes to  sketch.    Though the town of Gibraltar may be said to date from the fourteenth  century, it has preserved very little architectural evidence of its  antiquity. Rebuilt on an enlarged and improved plan after its almost  complete destruction during the great siege, it is still, on the  whole, a mean-looking town, with narrow streets and lanes and an  incongruous mixture of houses after the English and the Spanish types.  As a proprietor may at any moment be called upon to give up his house  and ground at the demand of the military authorities, he is naturally  deterred from spending his money on substantial or sumptuous  erections. The area of the town is about one hundred acres.    Gibraltar was known to the Greek and Roman geographers as Calpe or  Alybe, the two names being probably corruptions of the same local  (perhaps Phenician) word. The eminence on the African coast near  Ceuta, which bears the modern English name of Apes' Hill, was then  designated Abyla; and Calpe and Abyla, at least according to an  ancient and widely current interpretation, formed the renowned pillars  of Hercules (Herculis columnae), which for centuries were the limits of  enterprise to the seafaring peoples of the Mediterranean world.    The strategic importance of the rock appears to have been first  discovered by the Moors, who, when they crossed over from Africa in  the eighth century, selected it as the site of a fortress. From their  leader, Tarik Ibn Zeyad, it was called Gebel Tarik or Tarik's Hill;  and, though the name had a competitor in Gebel af Futah, or Hill of  the Entrance, it gradually gained acceptance, and still remains  sufficiently recognizable in the corrupted form of the present day.  The first siege of the rock was in 1309, when it was taken by Alonzo  Perez de Guzman for Ferdinand IV. of Spain, who, in order to attract  inhabitants to the spot, offered an asylum to swindlers, thieves, and  murderers, and promised to levy no taxes on the import or export of  goods. The attack of Ismail Ben Ferez, in 1315 (second siege), was  frustrated; but in 1333 Vasco Paez de Meira, having allowed the  fortifications and garrison to decay, was obliged to capitulate to  Mahomet IV. (third siege). Alphonso's attempts to recover possession  (fourth siege) were futile, though pertinacious and heroic, and he was  obliged to content himself with a tribute for the rock from Abdul  Melek of Granada; but after his successful attack on Algeciras in 1344  he was encouraged to try his fortune again at Gibraltar. In 1349 he  invested the rock, but the siege (fifth siege) was brought to an  untimely close by his death from the plague in February, 1350. The  next or sixth siege resulted simply in the transference of the coveted  position from the hands of the King of Morocco to those of Yussef III.  of Granada; and the seventh, undertaken by the Spanish Count of  Niebla, Enrico de Guzman, proved fatal to the besieger and his forces.  In 1462, however, success attended the efforts of Alphonso de Arcos  (eighth siege), and in August the rock passed once more under  Christian sway. The Duke of Medina Sidonia, a powerful grandee who had  assisted in its capture, was anxious to get possession of the  fortress, and though Henry IV. at first managed to maintain the claims  of the crown, the duke ultimately made good his ambition by force of  arms (ninth siege), and in 1469 the king was constrained to declare  his son and his heirs perpetual governors of Gibraltar. In 1479  Ferdinand and Isabella made the second duke Marquis of Gibraltar, and  in 1492 the third duke, Don Juan, was reluctantly allowed to retain  the fortress. At length, in 1501, Garcilaso de la Vega was ordered to  take possession of the place in the king's name, and it was formally  incorporated with the domains of the crown. After Ferdinand and  Isabella were both dead the duke, Don Juan, tried in 1506 to recover  possession, and added a tenth to the list of sieges. Thirty-four years  afterward the garrison had to defend itself against a much more  formidable attack (eleventh siege)--the pirates of Algiers having  determined to recover the rock for Mahomet and themselves. The  conflict was severe, but resulted in the repulse of the besiegers.  After this the Spaniards made great efforts to strengthen the place,  and they succeeded so well that throughout Europe Gibraltar was  regarded as impregnable.    In the course of the war of the Spanish succession, however, it was  taken by a combined English and Dutch fleet under Sir George Rooke,  assisted by a body of troops under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt.  The captors had ostensibly fought in the interests of Charles Archduke  of Austria (afterward Charles III.), but, though his sovereignty over  the rock was proclaimed on July 24, 1704, Sir George Rooke on his own  responsibility caused the English flag to be hoisted, and took  possession in name of Queen Anne. It is hardly to the honor of England  that it was both unprincipled enough to sanction and ratify the  occupation and ungrateful enough to leave unrewarded the general to  whose unscrupulous patriotism the acquisition was due. The Spaniards  keenly felt the injustice done to them, and the inhabitants of the  town of Gibraltar in great numbers abandoned their homes rather than  recognize the authority of the invaders. In October, 1704, the rock  was invested by sea and land; but the Spanish ships were dispersed by  Sir John Leake, and the Marquis of Villadarias fared so ill with his  forces that he was replaced by Marshal Tesse, who was at length  compelled to raise the siege in April, 1705. During the next twenty  years there were endless negotiations for the peaceful surrender of  the fortress, and in 1726 the Spaniards again appealed to arms. But  the Conde de la Torres, who had the chief command, succeeded no better  than his predecessors, and the defense of the garrison under General  Clayton and the Earl of Portmore was so effectual that the armistice  of June 23 practically put a close to the siege, though two years  elapsed before the general pacification ensued. The most memorable  siege of Gibraltar, indeed one of the most memorable of all sieges,  was that which it sustained from the combined land and sea forces of  France and Spain during the years 1779-1783. The grand attack on the  place was made on the 13th September, 1782, and all the resources of  power and science were exhausted by the assailants in the fruitless  attempt. On the side of the sea they brought to bear against the  fortress forty-six sail of the line and a countless fleet of gun and  mortar boats. But their chief hope lay in the floating batteries  planned by D'Arcon, an eminent French engineer, and built at the cost  of half a million sterling. They were so constructed as to be  impenetrable by the red hot shot which it was foreseen the garrison  would employ; and such hopes were entertained of their efficiency that  they were styled invincible. The Count D'Artois (afterward Charles X.)  hastened from Paris to witness the capture of the place. He arrived in  time to see the total destruction of the floating batteries and a  considerable portion of the combined fleet by the English fire.  Despite this disaster, however, the siege continued till brought to a  close by the general pacification, February 2, 1783. The history of  the four eventful years' siege is fully detailed in the work of  Drinkwater, who himself took part in the defense, and in the life of  its gallant defender Sir George Augustus Eliott, afterward Lord  Heathfield, whose military skill and moral courage place him among the  best soldiers and noblest men whom Europe produced during the 18th  century.    Since 1783 the history of Gibraltar has been comparatively uneventful.  In the beginning of 1801 there were rumors of a Spanish and French  attack, but the Spanish ships were defeated off Algeciras in June by  Admiral Saumarez. Improvements in the fortifications, maintenance of  military discipline, and legislation in regard to trade and smuggling  are the principal matters of recent interest.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FRANZ JOSEF I., NEW WAR SHIP.
