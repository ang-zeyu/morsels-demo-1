PARISHES INFECTED, 1.    The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all  over the town, and the more because in the last week in December, 1664,  another man died in the same house and of the same distemper. And then  we were easy again for about six weeks, when, none having died with any  marks of infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that,  I think it was about the 12th of February, another died in another  house, but in the same parish and in the same manner.    This turned the people's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town;  and, the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St. Giles's  Parish more than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was  among the people at that end of the town, and that many had died of it,  though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the  public as possible. This possessed the heads of the people very much;  and few cared to go through Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected,  unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it.    This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a  week, in the parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. Andrew's,  Holborn,[11] were[12] from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few  more or less; but, from the time that the plague first began in St.  Giles's Parish, it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in  number considerably. For example:--        Dec. 27 to Jan. 3,  St. Giles's      16                          St. Andrew's     17      Jan. 3 to Jan. 10,  St. Giles's      12                          St. Andrew's     25      Jan. 10 to Jan. 17, St. Giles's      18                          St. Andrew's     18      Jan. 17 to Jan. 24, St. Giles's      23                          St. Andrew's     16      Jan. 24 to Jan. 31, St. Giles's      24                          St. Andrew's     15      Jan. 31 to Feb. 7,  St. Giles's      21                          St. Andrew's     23      Feb. 7 to Feb. 14,  St. Giles's      24                Whereof one of the plague.    The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St.  Bride's, adjoining on one side of Holborn Parish, and in the parish of  St. James's, Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in  both which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to  six or eight, whereas at that time they were increased as follows:--        Dec. 20 to Dec. 27, St. Bride's       0                          St. James's       8      Dec. 27 to Jan. 3,  St. Bride's       6                          St. James's       9      Jan. 3 to Jan. 10,  St. Bride's      11                          St. James's       7      Jan. 10 to Jan. 17, St. Bride's      12                          St. James's       9      Jan. 17 to Jan. 24, St. Bride's       9                          St. James's      15      Jan. 24 to Jan. 31, St. Bride's       8                          St. James's      12      Jan. 31 to Feb. 7,  St. Bride's      13                          St. James's       5      Feb. 7 to Feb. 14,  St. Bride's      12                          St. James's       6    Besides this, it was observed, with great uneasiness by the people, that  the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks,  although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very  moderate.    The usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was  from about two hundred and forty, or thereabouts, to three hundred. The  last was esteemed a pretty high bill; but after this we found the bills  successively increasing, as follows:--                              Buried.   Increased.      Dec. 20 to Dec. 27      291         0      Dec. 27 to Jan. 3       349        58      Jan. 3 to Jan. 10       394        45      Jan. 10 to Jan. 17      415        21      Jan. 17 to Jan. 24      474        59    This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had  been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding  visitation of 1656.    However, all this went off again; and the weather proving cold, and the  frost, which began in December, still continuing very severe, even till  near the end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the  bills decreased again, and the city grew healthy; and everybody began to  look upon the danger as good as over, only that still the burials in St.  Giles's continued high. From the beginning of April, especially, they  stood at twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th,  when there was[13] buried in St. Giles's Parish thirty, whereof two of  the plague, and eight of the spotted fever (which was looked upon as the  same thing); likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the  whole increased, being eight the week before, and twelve the week above  named.    This alarmed us all again; and terrible apprehensions were among the  people, especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and  the summer being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some  hopes again: the bills were low; the number of the dead in all was but  388; there was none of the plague, and but four of the spotted fever.    But the following week it returned again, and the distemper was spread  into two or three other parishes, viz., St. Andrew's, Holborn, St.  Clement's-Danes; and, to the great affliction of the city, one died  within the walls, in the parish of St. Mary-Wool-Church, that is to say,  in Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks Market: in all, there were nine of the  plague, and six of the spotted fever. It was, however, upon inquiry,  found that this Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who,  having lived in Longacre, near the infected houses, had removed for fear  of the distemper, not knowing that he was already infected.    This was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable,  and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged  them was, that the city was healthy. The whole ninety-seven parishes  buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope, that, as it was chiefly  among the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and  the rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the  16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or  liberties;[14] and St. Andrew's buried but fifteen, which was very low.  It is true, St. Giles's buried two and thirty; but still, as there was  but one of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was  very low: for the week before, the bill was but three hundred and  forty-seven; and the week above mentioned, but three hundred and  forty-three. We continued in these hopes for a few days; but it was but  for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus. They  searched the houses, and found that the plague was really spread every  way, and that many died of it every day; so that now all our  extenuations[15] abated, and it was no more to be concealed. Nay, it  quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes  of abatement; that in the parish of St. Giles's it was gotten into  several streets, and several families lay all sick together; and  accordingly, in the weekly bill for the next week, the thing began to  show itself. There was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague, but  this was all knavery and collusion; for St. Giles's Parish, they buried  forty in all, whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague,  though they were set down of other distempers. And though the number of  all the burials were[16] not increased above thirty-two, and the whole  bill being but three hundred and eighty-five, yet there was[17] fourteen  of the spotted fever, as well as fourteen of the plague; and we took it  for granted, upon the whole, that there were fifty died that week of the  plague.    The next bill was from the 23d of May to the 30th, when the number of  the plague was seventeen; but the burials in St. Giles's were  fifty-three, a frightful number, of whom they set down but nine of the  plague. But on an examination more strictly by the justices of the  peace, and at the lord mayor's[18] request, it was found there were  twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish, but had  been set down of the spotted fever, or other distempers, besides others  concealed.    But those were trifling things to what followed immediately after. For  now the weather set in hot; and from the first week in June, the  infection spread in a dreadful manner, and the bills rise[19] high; the  articles of the fever, spotted fever, and teeth, began to swell: for all  that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbors  shunning and refusing to converse with them, and also to prevent  authority shutting up their houses, which, though it was not yet  practiced, yet was threatened; and people were extremely terrified at  the thoughts of it.    The second week in June, the parish of St. Giles's, where still the  weight of the infection lay, buried one hundred and twenty, whereof,  though the bills said but sixty-eight of the plague, everybody said  there had been a hundred at least, calculating it from the usual number  of funerals in that parish as above.    Till this week the city continued free, there having never any died  except that one Frenchman, who[20] I mentioned before, within the whole  ninety-seven parishes. Now, there died four within the city,--one in  Wood Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark  was entirely free, having not one yet died on that side of the water.

Buddy remembered that drive as he could not remember the comfortable  ranch house of his earlier babyhood. To him afterward it seemed that  life began with the great herd of cattle. He came to know just how low  the sun must slide from the top of the sky before the \"point\" would  spread out with noses to the ground, pausing wherever a mouthful of  grass was to be found. When these leaders of the herd stopped, the  cattle would scatter and begin feeding. If there was water they would  crowd the banks of the stream or pool, pushing and prodding one another  with their great, sharp horns. Later, when the sun was gone and dusk  crept out of nowhere, the cowboys would ride slowly around the herd,  pushing it quietly into a smaller compass. Then, if Buddy were not too  sleepy, he would watch the cattle lie down to chew their cuds in deep,  sighing content until they slept. It reminded Buddy vaguely of when  mother popped corn in a wire popper, a long time ago-before they all  lived in a wagon and went with the herd. First one and two-then there  would be three, four, five, as many as Buddy could count-then the whole  herd would be lying down.    Buddy loved the camp-fires. The cowboys would sit around the one where  his father and mother sat--mother with Dulcie in her arms--and they  would smoke and tell stories, until mother told him it was time little  boys were in bed. Buddy always wanted to know what they said after he  had climbed into the big wagon where mother had made a bed, but he never  found out. He could remember lying there listening sometimes to the  niggers singing at their own campfire within call, Ezra always singing  the loudest,--just as a bull always could be heard above the bellowing  of the herd.    All his life, Ezra's singing and the monotonous bellowing of a herd  reminded Buddy of one mysteriously terrible time when there weren't  any rivers or any ponds or anything along the trail, and they had to be  careful of the water and save it, and he and Dulcie were not asked  to wash their faces. I think that miracle helped to fix the incident  indelibly in Buddy's mind; that, and the bellowing of the cattle. It  seemed a month to Buddy, but as he grew older he learned that it was  three days they went without water.    The first day he did not remember especially, except that mother had  talked about clean aprons that night, and failed to produce any. The  second he recalled quite clearly. Father came to the wagons sometime in  the night to see if mother was asleep. Their murmured talk wakened Buddy  and he heard father say:    \"We'll hold 'em, all right, Lassie. And there's water ahead. It's marked  on the trail map. Don't you worry--I'll stay up and help the boys. The  cattle are uneasy--but we'll hold 'em.\"    The third day Buddy never forgot. That was the day when mother forgot  that Q stands for Quagga, and permitted Buddy to call it P, just for  fun, because it looked so much like P. And when he said \"W is water \",  mother made a funny sound and said right out loud, \"Oh God, please!\" and  told Buddy to creep back and play with Sister--when Sister was asleep,  and there were still x, y and z to say, let alone that mysterious  And-so-forth which seemed to mean so much and so little and never was  called upon to help spell a word. Never since he began to have lessons  had mother omitted a single letter or cut the study hour down the  teeniest little bit.    Buddy was afraid of something, but he could not think what it was that  frightened him. He began to think seriously about water, and to listen  uneasily to the constant lowing of the herd. The increased shouting  of the niggers driving the lagging ones held a sudden significance. It  occurred to him that the niggers had their hands full, and that they had  never driven so big a \"Drag.\" It was hotter than ever, too, and they had  twice stopped to yoke in fresh oxen. Ezra had boasted all along that  ole Bawley would keep his end up till they got clah to Wyoming. But ole  Bawley had stopped, and stopped, and at last had to be taken out of the  yoke. Buddy began to wish they would hurry up and find a river.    None of the cowboys would take him on the saddle and let him ride, that  day. They looked harassed--Buddy called it cross--when they rode up to  the wagon to give their horses a few mouthfuls of water from the barrel.  Step-and-a-Half couldn't spare any more, they told mother. He had  declared at noon that he needed every drop he had for the cooking, and  there would be no washing of dishes whatever. Later, mother had studied  a map and afterwards had sat for a long while staring out over the backs  of the cattle, her face white. Buddy thought perhaps mother was sick.    That day lasted hours and hours longer than any other day that Buddy  could remember. His father looked cross, too, when he rode back to them.  Once it was to look at the map which mother had studied. They talked  together afterwards, and Buddy heard his father say that she must not  worry; the cattle had good bottom, and could stand thirst better than a  poor herd, and another dry camp would not really hurt anyone.    He had uncovered the water barrel and looked in, and had ridden straight  over to the chuck-wagon, his horse walking alongside the high seat where  Step-and-a-Half sat perched listlessly with a long-lashed oxwhip in his  hand. Father had talked for a few minutes, and had ridden back scowling.    \"That old scoundrel has got two ten-gallon kegs that haven't been  touched!\" he told mother. \"Yo' all mustn't water any more horses out of  your barrel Send the boys to Step-and-a-Half. Yo' all keep what you've  got. The horses have got to have water--to-night it's going to be hell  to hold the herd, and if anybody goes thirsty it'll be the men, not the  horses But yo' all send them to the other wagon, Lassie Mind, now! Not a  drop to anyone.\"    After father rode away, Buddy crept up and put his two short arms around  mother. \"Don't cry. I don't have to drink any water,\" he soothed her. He  waited a minute and added optimistically, \"Dere's a BI--IG wiver comin'  pitty soon. Oxes smells water a hunerd miles. Ezra says so. An' las'  night Crumpy was snuffin' an' snuffin'. I saw 'im do it. He smelt a BIG  wiver. THAT bi-ig!\" He spread his short arms as wide apart as they would  reach, and smiled tremulously.    Mother squeezed Buddy so hard that he grunted.    \"Dear little man, of course there is. WE don't mind, do we? I-was  feeling sorry for the poor cattle.\"    \"De're firsty,\" Buddy stated solemnly, his eyes big. \"De're bawlin' fer  a drink of water. I guess de're AWFUL firsty. Dere's a big wiver comin'  now Crumpy smelt a big wiver.\"    Buddy's mother stared across the arid plain parched into greater  barrenness by the heat that had been unremitting for the past week.  Buddy's faith in the big river she could not share. Somehow they had  drifted off the trail marked on the map drawn by George Williams.    Williams had warned them to carry as much water as possible in barrels,  as a precaution against suffering if they failed to strike water each  night. He had told them that water was scarce, but that his cowboy  scouts and the deep-worn buffalo trails had been able to bring him  through with water at every camp save two or three. The Staked Plains,  he said, would be the hardest drive. And this was the Staked Plains--and  it was hard driving!    Buddy did not know all that until afterwards, when he heard father talk  of the drive north. But he would have remembered that day and the night  that followed, even though he had never heard a word about it.  The bawling of the herd became a doleful chant of misery. Even the  phlegmatic oxen that drew the wagons bawled and slavered while they  strained forward, twisting their heads under the heavy yokes. They  stopped oftener than usual to rest, and when Buddy was permitted to walk  with the perspiring Ezra by the leaders, he wondered why the oxen's eyes  were red, like Dulcie's when she had one of her crying spells.    At night the cowboys did not tie their horses and sit down while they  ate, but stood by their mounts and bolted food hurriedly, one eye always  on the restless cattle, that walked around and around, and would neither  eat nor lie down, but lowed incessantly. Once a few animals came close  enough to smell the water in a bucket where Frank Davis was watering  his sweat-streaked horse, and Step-and-a-Half's wagon was almost upset  before the maddened cattle could be driven back to the main herd.    \"No use camping,\" Bob Birnie told the boys gathered around  Step-and-a-Half's Dutch ovens. \"The cattle won't stand. We'll wear  ourselves and them out trying to hold 'em-they may as well be hunting  water as running in circles. Step-and-a-Half, keep your cooked grub  handy for the boys, and yo' all pack up and pull out. We'll turn the  cattle loose and follow. If there's any water in this damned country  they'll find it.\"    Years afterwards, Buddy learned that his father had sent men out to  hunt water, and that they had not found any. He was ten when this was  discussed around a spring roundup fire, and he had studied the matter  for a few minutes and then had spoken boldly his mind.    \"You oughta kept your horses as thirsty as the cattle was, and I bet  they'd a' found that water,\" he criticized, and was sent to bed for his  tactlessness. Bob Birnie himself had thought of that afterwards, and had  excused the oversight by saying that he had depended on the map, and had  not foreseen a three-day dry drive.    However that may be, that night was a night of panicky desperation.  Ezra walked beside the oxen and shouted and swung his lash, and the  oxen strained forward bellowing so that not even Dulcie could sleep,  but whimpered fretfully in her mother's arms. Buddy sat up wide-eyed and  watched for the big river, and tried not to be a 'fraid-cat and cry like  Dulcie.    It was long past starry"]]]
