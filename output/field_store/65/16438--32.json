[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#3)"],[1,"that is to come  is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of all those who  follow Me.\" And, again, He saith: \"Of all the tributes I have paid to Him  Who is to come after Me, the greatest is this, My written confession, that  no words of Mine can adequately describe Him, nor can any reference to Him  in My Book, the Bayan, do justice to His Cause.\"    Whoso hath searched the depths of the oceans that lie hid within these  exalted words, and fathomed their import, can be said to have discovered a  glimmer of the unspeakable glory with which this mighty, this sublime, and  most holy Revelation hath been endowed. From the excellence of so great a  Revelation the honor with which its faithful followers must needs be  invested can be well imagined. By the righteousness of the one true God!  The very breath of these souls is in itself richer than all the treasures  of the earth. Happy is the man that hath attained thereunto, and woe  betide the heedless.            VII: VERILY I SAY, THIS IS THE DAY IN WHICH MANKIND...      Verily I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the Face, and  hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of God hath been raised, and  the light of His countenance hath been lifted up upon men. It behoveth  every man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his  heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His  Revelation, the proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His glory.    Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in all the sacred  Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul of every  Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous  Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to  attain it. No sooner, however, had the Day Star of His Revelation  manifested itself in the heaven of God's Will, than all, except those whom  the Almighty was pleased to guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless.    O thou that hast remembered Me! The most grievous veil hath shut out the  peoples of the earth from His glory, and hindered them from hearkening to  His call. God grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth,  and that the seal, \"the Kingdom is God's\", may be stamped upon the brow of  all its peoples.            VIII: BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD! THESE ARE THE...      By the righteousness of God! These are the days in which God hath proved  the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers and Prophets, and  beyond them those that stand guard over His sacred and inviolable  Sanctuary, the inmates of the celestial Pavilion and dwellers of the  Tabernacle of Glory. How severe, therefore, the test to which they who  join partners with God must needs be subjected!            IX: O HUSAYN! CONSIDER THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH...      O Husayn! Consider the eagerness with which certain peoples and nations  have anticipated the return of Imam-Husayn, whose coming, after the  appearance of the Qa'im, hath been prophesied, in days past, by the chosen  ones of God, exalted be His glory. These holy ones have, moreover,  announced that when He Who is the Day Spring of the manifold grace of God  manifesteth Himself, all the Prophets and Messengers, including the Qa'im,  will gather together beneath the shadow of the sacred Standard which the  Promised One will raise. That hour is now come. The world is illumined  with the effulgent glory of His countenance. And yet, behold how far its  peoples have strayed from His path! None have believed in Him except them  who, through the power of the Lord of Names, have shattered the idols of  their vain imaginings and corrupt desires and entered the city of  certitude. The seal of the choice Wine of His Revelation hath, in this Day  and in His Name, the Self-Sufficing, been broken. Its grace is being  poured out upon men. Fill thy cup, and drink in, in His Name, the Most  Holy, the All-Praised.            X: THE TIME FOREORDAINED UNTO THE PEOPLES AND...      The time foreordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the earth is now  come. The promises of God, as recorded in the holy Scriptures, have all  been fulfilled. Out of Zion hath gone forth the Law of God, and Jerusalem,  and the hills and land thereof, are filled with the glory of His  Revelation. Happy is the man that pondereth in his heart that which hath  been revealed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  Meditate upon this, O ye beloved of God, and let your ears be attentive  unto His Word, so that ye may, by His grace and mercy, drink your fill  from the crystal waters of constancy, and become as steadfast and  immovable as the mountain in His Cause.    In the Book of Isaiah it is written: \"Enter into the rock, and hide thee  in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.\" No  man that meditateth upon this verse can fail to recognize the greatness of  this Cause, or doubt the exalted character of this Day--the Day of God  Himself. This same verse is followed by these words: \"And the Lord alone  shall be exalted in that Day.\" This is the Day which the Pen of the Most  High hath glorified in all the holy Scriptures. There is no verse in them  that doth not declare the glory of His holy Name, and no Book that doth  not testify unto the loftiness of this most exalted theme. Were We to make  mention of all that hath been revealed in these heavenly Books and holy  Scriptures concerning this Revelation, this Tablet would assume impossible  dimensions. It is incumbent in this Day, upon every man to place his whole  trust in the manifold bounties of God, and arise to disseminate, with the  utmost wisdom, the verities of His Cause. Then, and only then, will the  whole earth be enveloped with the morning light of His Revelation.            XI: ALL GLORY BE TO THIS DAY, THE DAY IN WHICH THE...      All glory be to this Day, the Day in which the fragrances of mercy have  been wafted over all created things, a Day so blest that past ages and  centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in which the countenance of  the Ancient of Days hath turned towards His holy seat. Thereupon the  voices of all created things, and beyond them those of the Concourse on  high, were heard calling aloud: \"Haste thee, O Carmel, for lo, the light  of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner  of the heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.\"    Seized with transports of joy, and raising high her voice, she thus  exclaimed: \"May my life be a sacrifice to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast  fixed Thy gaze upon me, hast bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and hast  directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from Thee, O Thou Source of  everlasting life, hath well nigh consumed me, and my remoteness from Thy  presence hath burned away my soul. All praise be to Thee for having  enabled me to hearken to Thy call, for having honored me with Thy  footsteps, and for having quickened my soul through the vitalizing  fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou  didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when the hour at  which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike, Thou didst  breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation  shook to its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay  hidden within the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created  things.\"    No sooner had her voice reached that most exalted Spot than We made reply:  \"Render thanks unto thy Lord, O Carmel. The fire of thy separation from Me  was fast consuming thee, when the ocean of My presence surged before thy  face, cheering thine eyes and those of all creation, and filling with  delight all things visible and invisible. Rejoice, for God hath in this  Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee the dawning-place of  His signs and the day spring of the evidences of His Revelation. Well is  it with him that circleth around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of  thy glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord thy God hath  showered upon thee. Seize thou the Chalice of Immortality in the name of  thy Lord, the All-Glorious, and give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He, in  token of His mercy unto thee, hath turned thy sorrow into gladness, and  transmuted thy grief into blissful joy. He, verily, loveth the spot which  hath been made the seat of His throne, which His footsteps have trodden,  which hath been honored by His presence, from which He raised His call,  and upon which He shed His tears.    \"Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was  hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is  manifest; His all-encompassing splendor is revealed. Beware lest thou  hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that  hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled  in adoration the favored of God, the pure in heart, and the company of the  most exalted angels. Oh, how I long to announce unto every spot on the  surface of the earth, and to carry to each one of its cities, the  glad-tidings of this Revelation--a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai  hath been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: 'Unto  God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.' Verily  this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement,  the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a  bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for  revelation. Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest  the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.\"    Sanctified be the Lord of all mankind, at the mention of Whose name all  the atoms of the earth have been made to vibrate, and the Tongue of  Grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in His"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16941"],[0,"The Hidden Words of Bahá'u'lláh (#3)"],[1,"thee, then be  content with what We have ordained for thy sake, for this is that which  profiteth thee, if therewith thou dost content thyself.        \"19: O SON OF THE WONDROUS VISION! I have breathed within thee a breath of  My own...\"      O SON OF THE WONDROUS VISION! I have breathed within thee a breath of My  own Spirit, that thou mayest be My lover. Why hast thou forsaken Me and  sought a beloved other than Me?        \"20: O SON OF SPIRIT! My claim on thee is great, it cannot be  forgotten....\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! My claim on thee is great, it cannot be forgotten. My  grace to thee is plenteous, it cannot be veiled. My love has made in thee  its home, it cannot be concealed. My light is manifest to thee, it cannot  be obscured.        \"21: O SON OF MAN! Upon the tree of effulgent glory I have hung for...\"      O SON OF MAN! Upon the tree of effulgent glory I have hung for thee the  choicest fruits, wherefore hast thou turned away and contented thyself  with that which is less good? Return then unto that which is better for  thee in the realm on high.        \"22: O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself.  Rise then unto that for which thou wast created.        \"23: O SON OF THE SUPREME! To the eternal I call thee, yet thou dost seek  that...\"      O SON OF THE SUPREME! To the eternal I call thee, yet thou dost seek that  which perisheth. What hath made thee turn away from Our desire and seek  thine own?        \"24: O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which...\"      O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which beseemeth  thee not. Prostrate thyself before the countenance of thy God, the Lord of  might and power.        \"25: O SON OF SPIRIT! Vaunt not thyself over the poor, for I lead him  on...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! Vaunt not thyself over the poor, for I lead him on his  way and behold thee in thy evil plight and confound thee for evermore.        \"26: O SON OF BEING! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and...\"      O SON OF BEING! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy thyself  with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.        \"27: O SON OF MAN! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art...\"      O SON OF MAN! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art thyself a  sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed wouldst thou be,  and to this I bear witness.        \"28: O SON OF SPIRIT! Know thou of a truth: He that biddeth men be  just...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! Know thou of a truth: He that biddeth men be just and  himself committeth iniquity is not of Me, even though he bear My name.        \"29: O SON OF BEING! Ascribe not to any soul that which thou wouldst...\"      O SON OF BEING! Ascribe not to any soul that which thou wouldst not have  ascribed to thee, and say not that which thou doest not. This is My  command unto thee, do thou observe it.        \"30: O SON OF MAN! Deny not My servant should he ask anything from...\"      O SON OF MAN! Deny not My servant should he ask anything from thee, for  his face is My face; be then abashed before Me.        \"31: O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art...\"      O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to  a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be  called to give account for thy deeds.        \"32: O SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy to  thee....\"      O SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy to thee.  Wherefore dost thou grieve? I made the light to shed on thee its splendor.  Why dost thou veil thyself therefrom?        \"33: O SON OF SPIRIT! With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee:  rejoice!...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee: rejoice! To  the court of holiness I summon thee; abide therein that thou mayest live  in peace for evermore.        \"34: O SON OF SPIRIT! The spirit of holiness beareth unto thee the  joyful...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! The spirit of holiness beareth unto thee the joyful  tidings of reunion; wherefore dost thou grieve? The spirit of power  confirmeth thee in His cause; why dost thou veil thyself? The light of His  countenance doth lead thee; how canst thou go astray?        \"35: O SON OF MAN! Sorrow not save that thou art far from Us. Rejoice...\"      O SON OF MAN! Sorrow not save that thou art far from Us. Rejoice not save  that thou art drawing near and returning unto Us.        \"36: O SON OF MAN! Rejoice in the gladness of thine heart, that thou...\"      O SON OF MAN! Rejoice in the gladness of thine heart, that thou mayest be  worthy to meet Me and to mirror forth My beauty.        \"37: O SON OF MAN! Divest not thyself of My beauteous robe, and  forfeit...\"      O SON OF MAN! Divest not thyself of My beauteous robe, and forfeit not thy  portion from My wondrous fountain, lest thou shouldst thirst for evermore.        \"38: O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny  thyself...\"      O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself that  which thou desirest if thou seekest My pleasure.        \"39: O SON OF MAN! Neglect not My commandments if thou lovest My...\"      O SON OF MAN! Neglect not My commandments if thou lovest My beauty, and  forget not My counsels if thou wouldst attain My good pleasure.        \"40: O SON OF MAN! Wert thou to speed through the immensity of...\"      O SON OF MAN! Wert thou to speed through the immensity of space and  traverse the expanse of heaven, yet thou wouldst find no rest save in  submission to Our command and humbleness before Our Face.        \"41: O SON OF MAN! Magnify My cause that I may reveal unto thee the...\"      O SON OF MAN! Magnify My cause that I may reveal unto thee the mysteries  of My greatness and shine upon thee with the light of eternity.        \"42: O SON OF MAN! Humble thyself before Me, that I may graciously...\"      O SON OF MAN! Humble thyself before Me, that I may graciously visit thee.  Arise for the triumph of My cause, that while yet on earth thou mayest  obtain the victory.        \"43: O SON OF BEING! Make mention of Me on My earth, that in My...\"      O SON OF BEING! Make mention of Me on My earth, that in My heaven I may  remember thee, thus shall Mine eyes and thine be solaced.        \"44: O SON OF THE THRONE! Thy hearing is My hearing, hear thou  therewith....\"      O SON OF THE THRONE! Thy hearing is My hearing, hear thou therewith. Thy  sight is My sight, do thou see therewith, that in thine inmost soul thou  mayest testify unto My exalted sanctity, and I within Myself may bear  witness unto an exalted station for thee.        \"45: O SON OF BEING! Seek a martyr's death in My path, content with...\"      O SON OF BEING! Seek a martyr's death in My path, content with My pleasure  and thankful for that which I ordain, that thou mayest repose with Me  beneath the canopy of majesty behind the tabernacle of glory.        \"46: O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy...\"      O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or  to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the  manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest  paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!        \"47: O SON OF MAN! By My beauty! To tinge thy hair with thy blood...\"      O SON OF MAN! By My beauty! To tinge thy hair with thy blood is greater in  My sight than the creation of the universe and the light of both worlds.  Strive then to attain this, O servant!        \"48: O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love...\"      O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is  fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials.        \"49: O SON OF MAN! The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as...\"      O SON OF MAN! The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as doth the  rebel for forgiveness and the sinful for mercy.        \"50: O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how...\"      O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how canst thou walk  in the ways of them that are content with My pleasure? If trials afflict  thee not in thy longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain the light in thy  love for My beauty?        \"51: O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is...\"      O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and  vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy.

Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and...\"      O SON OF MAN! Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and should  abasement come upon thee, grieve not, for both shall pass away and be no  more.        \"53: O SON OF BEING!

Fear not abasement, for glory shall one day  rest on thee.        \"54: O SON OF BEING! If thine heart be set upon this eternal,  imperishable...\"      O SON OF BEING! If thine heart be set upon this eternal, imperishable  dominion, and this ancient, everlasting life, forsake this mortal and  fleeting sovereignty.        \"55: O SON OF BEING!

Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test  the gold, and with gold We test Our servants.        \"56: O SON OF MAN!
