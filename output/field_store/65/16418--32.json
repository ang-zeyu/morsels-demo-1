If it be right and desirable for thee  to speak, speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and  neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of  watching over our lips.  Nevertheless, devout conversation on  spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress, most  of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground  of fellowship in God.      CHAPTER XI    Of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress    We may enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying  ourselves with the sayings and doings of others, and things which  concern not ourselves.  How can he abide long time in peace who  occupieth himself with other men's matters, and with things  without himself, and meanwhile payeth little or rare heed to the  self within?  Blessed are the single-hearted, for they shall have  abundance of peace.    2. How came it to pass that many of the Saints were so perfect,  so contemplative of Divine things?  Because they steadfastly  sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so  were enabled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free  and at leisure for the thought of Him.  We are too much occupied  with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things.  Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are  we zealous for daily growth in grace.  And so we remain lukewarm  and unspiritual.    3. Were we fully watchful of ourselves, and not bound in spirit  to outward things, then might we be wise unto salvation, and make  progress in Divine contemplation.  Our great and grievous  stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and  desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the  Saints.  And when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly  are we cast down, and fly to the world to give us comfort.    4. If we would quit ourselves like men, and strive to stand firm  in the battle, then should we see the Lord helping us from Heaven.  For He Himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who  trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions of striving, to  the end that we may win the victory.  If we look upon our  progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances  and forms, our devoutness will soon come to an end.  But let us  lay the axe to the very root of our life, that, being cleansed  from affections, we may possess our souls in peace.    5. If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we  should go quickly on to perfection.  But on the contrary, we  often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our  conversion than after many years of profession.  Zeal and  progress ought to increase day by day; yet now it seemeth a great  thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour.  If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning,  then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and  joy.    6. It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder  thing to go contrary to our own will.  Yet if thou overcome not  slight and easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones?  Withstand thy will at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit,  lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties.  Oh,  if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring  to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh thou wouldst be  more zealous for spiritual profit.      CHAPTER XII    Of the uses of adversity    It is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities,  for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger  and sojourner, and may not put his trust in any worldly thing.  It is good that we sometimes endure contradictions, and are  hardly and unfairly judged, when we do and mean what is good.  For these things help us to be humble, and shield us from  vain-glory.  For then we seek the more earnestly the witness of  God, when men speak evil of us falsely, and give us no credit for  good.    2. Therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon God, so that he  needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men.  When a man who  feareth God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil  thoughts, then he seeth that God is the more necessary unto him,  since without God he can do no good thing.  Then he is heavy of  heart, he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of  his heart.  Then he groweth weary of life, and would fain depart  and be with Christ.  By all this he is taught that in the world  there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace.      CHAPTER XIII    Of resisting temptation    So long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and  trial.  Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the  earth is a trial.(1)  And therefore ought each of us to give heed  concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest  the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but  goeth about seeking whom he may devour.  No man is so perfect in  holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be  wholly free from them.    2. Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our  profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through  them we are humbled, purified, instructed.  All Saints have  passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited  thereby.  And they who endured not temptation became reprobate  and fell away.  There is no position so sacred, no place so  secret, that it is without temptations and adversities.    3. There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he  liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves,  in that we are born in concupiscence.  One temptation or sorrow  passeth, and another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat  to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness. Many who  seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into them.  By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by endurance and  true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.    4. He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the  root, shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to  him the more quickly, and will be the more terrible.  Little by  little, through patience and longsuffering, thou shalt conquer by  the help of God, rather than by violence and thine own strength  of will.  In the midst of temptation often seek counsel; and deal  not hardly with one who is tempted, but comfort and strengthen  him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself.    5. The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of  temper and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a  helm is tossed about by the waves, so is a man who is careless  and infirm of purpose tempted, now on this side, now on that.  As fire testeth iron, so doth temptation the upright man.  Oftentimes we know not what strength we have; but temptation  revealeth to us what we are.  Nevertheless, we must watch,  especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe  the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within  the mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked.  Wherefore one saith,       Check the beginnings; once thou might'st have cured,     But now 'tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured.    For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the  strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent.  And so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because  he was not resisted at the beginning.  And the longer a man  delayeth his resistance, the weaker he groweth, and the stronger  groweth the enemy against him.    6. Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the  beginning of their conversion, some at the end.  Some are sorely  tried their whole life long.  Some there are who are tempted but  lightly, according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of  God, who knoweth the character and circumstances of men, and  ordereth all things for the welfare of His elect.    7. Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the  more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to  help us in all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul  saith, with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be  able to bear it.(2)  Let us therefore humble ourselves under the  mighty hand of God in all temptation and trouble, for He will  save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit.    8. In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he  hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue  doth the more appear.  Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout  and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he  behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then is there  hope of great progress.  Some are kept safe from great  temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and  common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to  themselves in great things, being weak in small things.    (1) Job vii. 1 (Vulg.).   (2) 1 Corinthians x. 13.      CHAPTER XIV    On avoiding rash judgment    Look well unto thyself, and beware that thou judge not the doings  of others.  In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often  erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining  himself he always laboureth to good purpose.  According as a  matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for  easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal  feeling.  If God were always the sole object of our desire, we  should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our  fancy.    2. But often some secret thought lurking within us, or even some  outward circumstance, turneth us aside.  Many are secretly  seeking their own ends in what they do, yet know it not.

This is undoubtedly wrong, as Wren showed. I take the measurements  from Mr. Gilbertson's admirable little handbook, who, with some  modifications, has taken them from Longman's _Three Cathedrals_.

Length of church (excluding Inigo Jones's porch)  586 ft.      Wren (_Parentalia_) thinks this estimate of the spire height too  great; he reckons it at 460 feet.    The cathedral resembled in general outline that of Salisbury, but it  was a hundred feet longer, and the spire was sixty or eighty feet  higher. The tower was open internally as far as the base of the spire,  and was probably more beautiful both inside and out than that of any  other English cathedral. The spire was a structure of timber covered  with lead. In Mr. Longman's _Three Cathedrals_ are some beautiful  engravings after a series of drawings by Mr. E.B. Ferrey, reproducing  the old building. There is one curious mistake: he has not given at  the base of the spire, the corner pinnacles on the tower, which were  certainly there. They are clearly shown in Wyngaerde's drawing of  London, and on a seal of the Chapter, which we reproduce. Some time  later than the rest of the work, stately flying buttresses were added  to strengthen the tower walls. One special feature of the cathedral  was the exquisite Rose window at the east end, of which we give an  engraving. It had not a rival in England, perhaps one might say in  Europe. Inigo Jones, if he was really the architect of St. Katharine  Cree, made a poor copy of it for that church, where it may still be  seen.    Of great historical events which had occurred during the growth of St.  Paul's cathedral we have to speak hereafter. As the momentous changes  of the sixteenth century drew near, the godlessness and unbelief  which did so much to alienate many from the Church found strong  illustrations in the worldliness which seemed to settle down awhile  on St. Paul's and its services. Clergymen appeared here to be hired  (Chaucer's _Prologue_), and lawyers met their clients. Falstaff  \"bought Bardolph at Paul's.\" But before we come to the great changes,  it will be well to go back and take note of the surroundings of the  cathedral, and also to stroll through the interior, seeing that  we have now come to its completion as a building, except for one  addition, a real but incongruous one, which belongs to the Stuart  period. The accession of Henry VIII. then sees it, with that  exception, finished, and we discern three main architectural features:  there is still some heavy Norman work, some very excellent Early  English, and some late Decorated. And there are also tombs of deep  interest; though they are not to be compared indeed with those of  Westminster Abbey. There are only two Kings to whom we shall come in  our walk. But let us have the outside first.    [Footnote 1: On the site of this old tower, Archbishop Kilwardby  afterwards built the house of the Dominicans, or \"Black Friars.\"]    [Footnote 2: Hence old Fuller's racy witticism: \"S.

The churchyard had got such a bad character  for robberies, fornications, even murders, that the Dean and Chapter  requested King Edward I. to allow them to heighten this wall, with  fitting gates and posterns, to be opened every morning and closed at  night. From the north-east corner of Ave Maria Lane, it went east  along Paternoster Row, to the end of Old Change, then south to Carter  Lane, thence northwards to Creed Lane, with Ave Maria Lane on the  other side. It will of course be remembered that the Fleet River ran  along at the bottom of the hill, not bearing the best character in  the world for savouriness even then, but crowded with boats as far as  Holborn. It will be remembered that there was also a gate in the City  Wall, on Ludgate Hill, a little to the west of St. Martin's Church.  The gate had a little chapel within it, but the greater part of the  building was used for a prison. Passing under it, and up Ludgate Hill,  you came to the western gate of the Cathedral Close--a wide and strong  one--spanning the street.[1] There were six of these gates; the second  was at Paul's Alley, leading to the Postern Gate, or \"Little  North Door\"; third, Canon's Alley; fourth, Little Gate (corner of  Cheapside); fifth, St. Augustine's Gate (west end of Watling Street);  and sixth, Paul's Chain. The ecclesiastical names bear their own  explanation: \"Ave Maria\" and \"Paternoster\" indicated that rosaries and  copies of the Lord's Prayer were sold in this street. \"Creed\" was a  somewhat later name. In olden days, it was Spurrier's Lane, _i.e._,  where spurs were sold. But when an impetus was given to instruction  under the Tudors, copies of the alphabet and the Creed were added to  such articles of sale, and this was the place to get them. Paul's  Chain got its name from the chain which was drawn across the gateway  when service was going on, to prevent noise. The other names explain  themselves.    Inside this area ran a cloister along the north side, turning a short  distance southwards at the east end. This cloister was rebuilt by Dean  More (1407-1421) round an enclosure which was a burial ground for  clerics and men of mark in the City. The cloister was decorated by the  series of paintings commonly known as the Dance of Death, such as may  still be seen in the Cathedral of Basel, and in other places. Verses  were appended to each picture, which were translated by Lydgate, the  monk of Bury, and writer of poems on classical and religious subjects.  Over the eastern side of the cloister was the library, a very fine  one, but it perished in the Great Fire. The name \"Pardon\" applied to  burial grounds, was not uncommon, apparently. The victims of the Black  Death, in 1348, were buried in a piece of ground on the site of the  Charter House, and this ground was known as Pardon Churchyard; and in  the register books of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, there are two entries  of City magnates buried at different times by \"the Pardon Door.\" Does  it indicate that these particular burial grounds were bought with  money paid for indulgences or expiations?    In the middle of the Pardon Churchyard of St. Paul's was a chapel  of rich ornament, built by \"Gilbert Becket, portgrave and principal  magistrate in this City in the reign of King Stephen.\" He was the  great Archbishop's father. The monuments in it and the surrounding  churchyard are said to have rivalled in beauty those inside the  cathedral. How this cloister and chapel fared, we shall see presently.    [Illustration: A FUNERAL PROCESSION.  _From a MS. of the Hours of the Virgin. Fifteenth Century. British  Museum_, 27697.]    North of the Pardon Churchyard was the College of the Minor Canons,  bordering on Paternoster Row; and between it and the cathedral, in an  open space, which in older times was the authorised meeting-place  of the folkmote, was Paul's Cross. There is no doubt of its exact  situation, for during his valuable explorations into the history of  the cathedral, Mr. Penrose discovered its foundations, six feet below  the pavement, and this site is now marked by an inscription. It is all  now laid out as a pleasant garden, and a goodly number of people may  be seen there daily feeding the tame pigeons.    I have shown already (see _Mediaeval London_, p. 8) that the Folkmote  was held on a large green, east of the cathedral. There were three  such meetings yearly, to which the citizens were summoned by the  ringing of the great cathedral bell. When the first Cross was erected  on the ground there is no record to show. We may take for granted that  there was first a pulpit of wood. Not only were sermons preached, but  proclamations and State announcements were delivered from it, also  Papal bulls, excommunications, and the public penance of notorious  offenders.
