Glorified be God, its Creator  and Fashioner, above all that He hath brought forth and ordained therein!  By God, the Sovereign Protector, the Self-Subsisting, the Almighty! Were I  to unveil to thine eyes the gates of this city, which have been fashioned  by the right hand of might and power, thou wouldst behold that which none  before thee hath ever beheld, and wouldst witness that which no other soul  hath ever witnessed. Thou wouldst apprehend the most obscure signs and the  most abstruse allusions, and wouldst clearly behold the mysteries of the  beginning in the point of the end. All matters would be made easy unto  thee, fire would be turned into light, knowledge and blessings, and thou  wouldst abide in safety within the court of holiness.    19 Bereft, however, of the essence of the mysteries of His wisdom, which  We have imparted unto thee beneath the veils of these blessed and  soul-stirring words, thou wouldst fail to attain unto even a sprinkling of  the oceans of divine knowledge or the crystal streams of divine power, and  wouldst be recorded in the Mother Book, through the Pen of oneness and by  the Finger of God, amongst the ignorant. Nor wouldst thou be able to grasp  a single word of the Book or a single utterance of the Kindred of God(14)  concerning the mysteries of the beginning and the end.    20 O thou whom We have outwardly never met, yet whom We inwardly cherish  in Our heart! Be fair in thy judgement and present thyself before Him Who  seeth and knoweth thee, even if thou seest and knowest Him not: Can any  soul be found to elucidate these words with such convincing arguments,  clear testimonies, and unmistakable allusions as to appease the heart of  the seeker and relieve the soul of the listener? Nay, by the One in Whose  hand is My soul! Unto none is given to quaff even a dewdrop thereof unless  he entereth within this city, a city whose foundations rest upon mountains  of crimson-coloured ruby, whose walls are hewn of the chrysolite of divine  unity, whose gates are made of the diamonds of immortality, and whose  earth sheddeth the fragrance of divine bounty.    21 Having imparted unto thee, beneath countless veils of concealment,  certain hidden mysteries, We now return to Our elucidation of the Books of  old, that perchance thy feet may not slip and thou mayest receive with  complete certitude the portion which We shall bestow upon thee of the  billowing oceans of life in the realm of the names and attributes of God.    22 It is recorded in all the Books of the Gospel that He Who is the  Spirit(15) spoke in words of pure light unto His disciples, saying: \"Know  that heaven and earth may pass away, but my words shall never pass  away.\"(16) As is clear and evident to thine eminence, these words  outwardly mean that the Books of the Gospel will remain in the hands of  people till the end of the world, that their laws shall not be abrogated,  that their testimony shall not be abolished, and that all that hath been  enjoined, prescribed, or ordained therein shall endure forever.    23 O My brother! Sanctify thy heart, illumine thy soul, and sharpen thy  sight, that thou mayest perceive the sweet accents of the Birds of Heaven  and the melodies of the Doves of Holiness warbling in the Kingdom of  eternity, and perchance apprehend the inner meaning of these utterances  and their hidden mysteries. For otherwise, wert thou to interpret these  words according to their outward meaning, thou couldst never prove the  truth of the Cause of Him Who came after Jesus, nor silence the opponents,  nor prevail over the contending disbelievers. For the Christian divines  use this verse to prove that the Gospel shall never be abrogated and that,  even if all the signs recorded in their Books were fulfilled and the  Promised One appeared, He would have no recourse but to rule the people  according to the ordinances of the Gospel. They contend that if He were to  manifest all the signs indicated in the Books, but decree aught besides  that which Jesus had decreed, they would neither acknowledge nor follow  Him, so clear and self-evident is this matter in their sight.    24 Thou canst indeed hear the learned and the foolish amongst the people  voice the same objections in this day, saying: \"The sun hath not risen  from the West, nor hath the Crier cried out betwixt earth and heaven.  Water hath not inundated certain lands; the Dajjal(17) hath not appeared;  Sufyani(18) hath not arisen; nor hath the Temple been witnessed in the  sun.\" I heard, with Mine own ears, one of their divines proclaim: \"Should  all these signs come to pass and the long-awaited Qa'im appear, and should  He ordain, with respect to even our secondary laws, aught beyond that  which hath been revealed in the Qur'an, we would assuredly charge Him with  imposture, put Him to death, and refuse forever to acknowledge Him\", and  other statements such as these deniers make. And all this, when the Day of  Resurrection hath been ushered in, and the Trumpet hath been sounded, and  all the denizens of earth and heaven have been gathered together, and the  Balance hath been appointed, and the Bridge hath been laid, and the Verses  have been sent down, and the Sun hath shone forth, and the stars have been  blotted out, and the souls have been raised to life, and the breath of the  Spirit hath blown, and the angels have been arrayed in ranks, and Paradise  hath been brought nigh, and Hell made to blaze! These things have all come  to pass, and yet to this day not a single one of these people hath  recognized them! They all lie as dead within their own shrouds, save those  who have believed and repaired unto God, who rejoice in this day in His  celestial paradise, and who tread the path of His good-pleasure.    25 Veiled as they remain within their own selves, the generality of the  people have failed to perceive the sweet accents of holiness, inhale the  fragrance of mercy, or seek guidance, as bidden by God, from those who are  the custodians of the Scriptures. He proclaimeth, and His word, verily, is  the truth: \"Ask ye, therefore, of them that have the custody of the  Scriptures, if ye know it not.\"(19) Nay rather, they have turned aside  from them and followed instead the Samiri(20) of their own idle fancies.  Thus have they strayed far from the mercy of their Lord and failed to  attain unto His Beauty in the day of His presence. For no sooner had He  come unto them with a sign and a testimony from God than the same people  who had eagerly awaited the day of His Revelation, who had called upon Him  in the daytime and in the night season, who had implored Him to gather  them together in His presence and to grant that they may lay down their  lives in His path, be led aright by His guidance and illumined by His  light--this very people condemned and reviled Him, and inflicted upon Him  such cruelties as transcend both My capacity to tell and thine ability to  hear them. My very pen crieth out at this moment and the ink weepeth sore  and groaneth. By God! Wert thou to hearken with thine inner ear, thou  wouldst in truth hear the lamentations of the denizens of heaven; and wert  thou to remove the veil from before thine eyes, thou wouldst behold the  Maids of Heaven overcome and the holy souls overwhelmed, beating upon  their faces and fallen upon the dust.    26 Alas, alas, for that which befell Him Who was the Manifestation of the  Self of God, and for that which He and His loved ones were made to suffer!  The people inflicted upon them what no soul hath ever inflicted upon  another, and what no infidel hath wrought against a believer or suffered  at his hand. Alas, alas! That immortal Being sat upon the darksome dust,  the Holy Spirit lamented in the retreats of glory, the pillars of the  Throne crumbled in the exalted dominion, the joy of the world was changed  into sorrow in the crimson land, and the voice of the Nightingale was  silenced in the golden realm. Woe betide them for what their hands have  wrought and for what they have committed!    27 Hearken then unto that which the Bird of Heaven uttered, in the  sweetest and most wondrous accents, and in the most perfect and exalted  melodies, concerning them--an utterance that shall fill them with remorse  from now unto \"the day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the  worlds\": \"Although they had before prayed for victory over those who  believed not, yet when there came unto them He of Whom they had knowledge,  they disbelieved in Him. The curse of God on the infidels!\"(21) Such  indeed are their condition and attainments in their vain and empty life.  Erelong shall they be cast into the fire of affliction and find none to  help or succour them.    28 Be not veiled by aught that hath been revealed in the Qur'an, or by  what thou hast learned from the works of those Suns of immaculacy and  Moons of majesty,(22) regarding the perversion of the Texts by the  fanatical or their alteration by their corruptors. By these statements  only certain specific and clearly indicated passages are intended. In  spite of My weakness and poverty, I would assuredly be able, should I so  desire, to expound these passages unto thine eminence. But this would  divert us from our purpose and lead us astray from the outstretched path.  It would immerse us in limited allusions and distract us from that which  is beloved in the court of the All-Praised.    29 O thou who art mentioned in this outspread roll and who, amidst the  gloomy darkness that now prevaileth, hast been illumined by the splendours  of the sacred Mount in the Sinai of divine Revelation!

His punishment would be given to him by the  community.    There were occasional meetings of \"hundreds\", which were probably  a hundred hides of land or a hundred extended families, to  settle wide-spread disputes.            Chapter 2    The Times: 600-900    A community was usually an extended family. It's members lived in  villages in which a stone church was the most prominent  building. They lived in one-room huts with walls and roofs made  of wood, mud, and straw. Hangings covered the cracks in the  walls to keep the wind out. Smoke from a fire in the middle of  the room filtered out of cracks in the roof. Grain was ground at  home by rotating by hand one stone disk on another stone disk.  Some villages had a mill powered by the flow of water or by  horses.    Farmland surrounded the villages and was farmed by the community  as a whole under the direction of a lord. There was silver,  copper, iron, tin, gold, and various types of stones from remote  lead mines and quarries in the nation. Silver pennies replaced  the smaller scaetts. Freemen paid \"scot and lot\" according to  their means.    Everyone in the village went to church on Sunday and brought  gifts such as grain to the priest. Later, contributions in the  form of money became customary, and then expected. They were  called \"tithes\" and were spent for church repair, the clergy,  and poor and needy laborers. The parish of the priest was  coextensive with the holding of one landlord and was his  chaplain. The priest and other men who helped him, lived in the  church building. Some churches had lead roofs and iron hinges,  latches, and locks on their doors. The land underneath had been  given to the church by former Kings and persons who wanted the  church to say prayers to help their souls go from purgatory to  heaven and who also selected the first priest. The priest  conducted Christianized Easter ceremonies in the spring and  Christmas (Christ's mass) ceremonies in winter in place of the  pagan Yuletide festivities. Incense took the place of pagan  burnt offerings, holy water of haunted wells and streams, and  Christian incantations of sorcerer's spells.    The church baptized babies and officiated at marriage ceremonies.  It also said prayers for the dying, gave them funerals, and  buried them. There were burial service fees, candle dues, and  plough alms. A piece of stone with the dead person's name marked  his grave. It"]]]
