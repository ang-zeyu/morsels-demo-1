When the weft is in, it is shoved down into its  proper position by means of the reed-fork, and then the batten,  restored to its first position (edgewise), is brought down with firm  blows on the weft. It is by the vigorous use of the batten that the  Navajo serapes are rendered water-proof. In Plate XXXVIII the weaver  is seen bringing down this instrument \"in the manner and for the  purpose described,\" as the letters patent say.    When the lower shed has received its thread of weft the weaver opens  the upper shed. This is done by releasing the healds and shoving the  shed-rod down until it comes in contact with the healds; this opens  the upper shed down to the web. Then the weft is inserted and the  batten and reed-fork used as before. Thus she goes on with each shed  alternately until the web is finished.    It is, of course, desirable, at least in handsome blankets of  intricate pattern, to have both ends uniform even if the figure be a  little faulty in the center. To accomplish this some of the best  weavers depend on a careful estimate of the length of each figure  before they begin, and weave continuously in one direction; but the  majority weave a little portion of the upper end before they finish  the middle. Sometimes this is done by weaving from above downwards; at  other times it is done by turning the loom upside down and working  from below upwards in the ordinary manner. In Fig. 49, which  represents one of the very finest results of Navajo work, by the best  weaver in the tribe, it will be seen that exact uniformity in the ends  has not been attained. The figure was of such a nature that the  blanket had to be woven in one direction only.    I have described how the ends of the blanket are bordered with a stout  three-ply string applied to the folds of the warp. The lateral edges  of the blanket are similarly protected by stout cords applied to the  weft. The way in which these are woven in, next demands our attention.  Two stout worsted cords, tied together, are firmly attached at each  end of the cloth-beam just outside of the warp; they are then carried  upwards and loosely tied to the yarn-beam or the supplementary  yarn-beam. Every time the weft is turned at the edge these two strings  are twisted together and the weft is passed through the twist; thus  one thread or strand of this border is always on the outside. As it is  constantly twisted in one direction, it is evident that, after a  while, a counter-twist must form which would render the passage of the  weft between the cords difficult, if the cords could not be untwisted  again. Here the object of tying these cords loosely to one of the  upper beams, as before described, is displayed. From time to time the  cords are untied and the unwoven portion straightened as the work  progresses. Fig. 44 and Plate XXXVIII show these cords. The coarse  blankets do not have them. (Fig 42.)    Navajo blankets are single-ply, with designs the same on both sides,  no matter how elaborate these designs may be. To produce their  varigated patterns they have a separate skein, shuttle, or thread for  each component of the pattern. Take, for instance, the blanket  depicted in Fig. 49. Across this blanket, between the points _a--b_,  we have two serrated borders, two white spaces, a small diamond in the  center, and twenty-four serrated stripes, making in all twenty-nine  component parts of the pattern. Now, when the weaver was working in  this place, twenty-nine different threads of weft might have been seen  hanging from the face of the web at one time. In the girth pictured in  Fig. 44 five different threads of woof are shown depending from the  loom.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Weaving of saddle-girth.]    When the web is so nearly finished that the batten can no longer be  inserted in the warp, slender rods are placed in the shed, while the  weft is passed with increased difficulty on the end of a delicate  splinter and the reed-fork alone presses the warp home. Later it  becomes necessary to remove even the rod and the shed; then the  alternate threads are separated by a slender stick worked in tediously  between them, and two threads of woof are inserted--one above and the  other below the stick. The very last thread is sometimes put in with a  darning needle. The weaving of the last three inches requires more  labor than any foot of the previous work.    In Figs. 49, 50, 51, 52, and 53 it will be seen that there are small  fringes or tassels at the corners of the blankets; these are made of  the redundant ends of the four border-cords (_i.e._, the portions of  the cord by which they were tied to the beams), either simply tied  together or secured in the web with a few stitches.    The above is a description of the simplest mechanism by which the  Navajos make their blankets; but in manufacturing diagonals, sashes,  garters, and hair-bands the mechanism is much more complicated.    Sec. VII. For making diagonals the warp is divided into four sheds; the  uppermost one of these is provided with a shed-rod, the others are  supplied with healds. I will number the healds and sheds from below  upwards. The following diagram shows how the threads of the warp are  arranged in the healds and on the rod.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Diagram showing arrangement of threads of the  warp in the healds and on the rod.]    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Weaving of saddle-girth.]    When the weaver wishes the diagonal ridges to run upwards from right  to left, she opens the sheds in regular order from below upwards thus:  First, second, third, fourth, first, second, third, fourth, &c. When  she wishes the ridges to trend in the contrary direction she opens the  sheds in the inverse order. I found it convenient to take my  illustrations of this mode of weaving from a girth. In Figs. 44 and 46  the mechanism is plainly shown. The lowest (first) shed is opened and  the first set of healds drawn forward. The rings of the girth take the  place of the beams of the loom.    There is a variety of diagonal weaving practiced by the Navajos which  produces diamond figures; for this the mechanism is the same as that  just described, except that the healds are arranged differently on the  warp. The following diagram will explain this arrangement.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Diagram showing arrangement of helds in  diagonal weaving.]    To make the most approved series of diamonds the sheds are opened  twice in the direct order (_i.e._, from below upwards) and twice in  the inverse order, thus: First, second, third, fourth, first, second,  third, fourth, third, second, first, fourth, third, second, first,  fourth, and so on. If this order is departed from the figures become  irregular. If the weaver continues more than twice consecutively in  either order, a row of V-shaped figures is formed, thus: VVVV. Plate  XXXV represents a woman weaving a blanket of this pattern, and Fig. 48  shows a portion of a blanket which is part plain diagonal and part  diamond.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Diagonal cloth.]    Sec. VIII. I have heretofore spoken of the Navajo weavers always as of  the feminine gender because the large majority of them are women.  There are, however, a few men who practice the textile art, and among  them are to found the best artisans in the tribe.    [Illustration: PL. XXXVI.--NAVAJO WOMAN WEAVING A BELT.]    Sec. IX. Navajo blankets represent a wide range in quality and finish and  an endless variety in design, notwithstanding that all their figures  consist of straight lines and angles, no curves being used. As  illustrating the great fertility of this people in design I have to  relate that in the finer blankets of intricate pattern out of  thousands which I have examined, I do not remember to have ever seen  two exactly alike. Among the coarse striped blankets there is great  uniformity.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Navajo blanket of the finest quality.]    The accompanying pictures of blankets represent some in my private  collection. Fig. 49 depicts a blanket measuring 6 feet 9 inches by 5  feet 6 inches, and weighing nearly 6 pounds. It is made entirely of  Germantown yarn in seven strongly contrasting colors, and is the work  of a man who is generally conceded to be the best weaver in the tribe.  A month was spent in its manufacture. Its figures are mostly in  serrated stripes, which are the most difficult to execute with  regularity. I have heard that the man who wove this often draws his  designs on sand before he begins to work them on the loom. Fig. 50 _a_  shows a blanket of more antique design and material. It is 6 feet 6  inches by 5 feet 3 inches, and is made of native yarn and _bayeta_.  Its colors are black, white, dark-blue, red (_bayeta_) and--in a  portion of the stair-like figures--a pale blue. Fig. 50 _b_ depicts a  tufted blanket or rug, of a kind not common, having much the  appearance of an Oriental rug; it is made of shredded red flannel,  with a few simple figures in yellow, dark blue, and green. Fig. 51  represents a gaudy blanket of smaller size (5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet  7 inches) worn by a woman. Its colors are yellow, green, dark blue,  gray, and red, all but the latter color being in native yarn. Figs. 52  and 53 illustrate small or half-size blankets made for children's  wear. Such articles are often used for saddle blankets (although the  saddle-cloth is usually of coarser material) and are in great demand  among the Americans for rugs. Fig. 53 has a regular border of uniform  device all the way around--a very rare thing in Navajo blankets. Figs.  54 and 55 show portions of coarse blankets made more for use use than  ornament. Fig. 55 is made of loosely-twilled yarn, and is very warm  but not water-proof. Such blankets make excellent bedding for troops  in the field. Fig. 54 is a water-proof _serape_ of well-twilled native  wool.

If this river was the  Potomac, and most authorities believe that it was, the buffaloes seen by  Captain Argoll might easily have been in what is now the District of  Columbia.    Admitting the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the  Pembrook River of Captain Argoll, there is yet another bit of history  which fairly establishes the fact that in the early part of the  seventeenth century buffaloes inhabited the banks of the Potomac between  this city and the lower falls. In 1624 an English fur trader named Henry  Fleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who then  inhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with the  tribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few years  since in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint description of  the city's site as it then appeared. The following is from the  explorer's journal:    \"Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where we  came to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This place,  without question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all this  country, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in summer  and not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish. The  Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons in a place  where the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer,  buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * The 27th  of June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the tide rising  about 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, but we might  hear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant.\"[7]    [Note 7: Charles Burr Todd's \"Story of Washington,\" p. 18. New York,  1889.]    MARYLAND.--There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited Maryland,  except what has already been adduced with reference to the District of  Columbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken as conclusive  proof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the fact that the  bison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland is fairly  established. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of _Bison  americanus_ will yet be found both in Maryland and the District of  Columbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur.    VIRGINIA.--Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison in  Virginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd's meetings  with buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the  State, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the references  to the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia  mountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon's \"Present State of  Virginia,\" page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture _and domestication_  of buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was  situated on the James River, about 14 miles above Richmond. Apparently,  buffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the  Atlantic States.    NORTH CAROLINA.--Colonel Byrd's discoveries along the interstate  boundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of the  bison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the  survey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest  post-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. R. Moore, furnishes  reliable evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in  North Carolina: \"In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at  the house of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was  seventy then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba River, about 4  miles from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He  told me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buffalo  crossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were bare they would  eat the moss that grew upon them.\" The point indicated is in longitude  81° west and the date not far from 1750.    SOUTH CAROLINA.--Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose  observations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo  in South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From  these it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State  buffaloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority  of Colhoun, \"and we know that some of those who first settled the  Abbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo  there.\"[8] This appears to be the only definite locality in which the  presence of the species was recorded.    [Note 8: Long's Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter's River, 1823,  II, p. 26.]    GEORGIA.--The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the United  States was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of the Altamaha  River, opposite St. Simon's Island. Mr. Francis Moore, in his \"Voyage to  Georgia,\" made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,[9] makes the following  observation:    [Note 9: Coll. Georgia Hist. Soc., I, p. 117.]    \"The island [St. Simon's] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are no  buffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main.\" Elsewhere in  the same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunting by  Indians on the main-land near Darien.    In James E. Oglethorpe's enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts of  Georgia and South Carolina he mentions \"deer, elks, bears, wolves, and  buffaloes.\"[10]    [Note 10: Ibid., I, p. 51.]    Up to the time of Moore's voyage to Georgia the interior was almost  wholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the \"large  herds of buffalo on the main-land\" existed within a distance of 20 or 30  miles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge  of them; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the  whites at Darien \"under pretense of hunting buffalo.\"    ALABAMA.--Having established the existence of the bison in northwestern  Georgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in  Mississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally  expected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that  the bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful  search through all the records bearing upon the early history and  exploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed  to discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in  that State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama  Indians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this  instance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that the  buffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though history  fails to record it.    LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.--At the beginning of the eighteenth century,  buffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, not only  down to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but even in the  very Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. In a  \"Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchartrain,\" December 10, 1697, the  author, M. de Remonville, describes the country around the mouth of the  Mississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further says:[11]    \"A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might be  domesticated by rearing up the young calves.\" Whether these animals were  buffaloes might be considered an open question but for the following  additional information, which affords positive evidence: \"The trade in  furs and peltry would be immensely valuable and exceedingly profitable.  We could also draw from thence a great quantity of buffalo hides every  year, as the plains are filled with the animals.\"    In the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled \"Annals of Louisiana  from 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut\" (1698), the author records the  presence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay St.  Louis, as follows: \"The next day we left Pea Island, and passed through  the Little Rigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues from the  Bay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, near a  fountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called at  this time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the coast  of this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffaloes,  and other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the fort  (Biloxi).\"    [Note 11: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, B. F. French, 1869,  first series, p. 2.]    The occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,[12] and also (p.  115) at the mouth of Red River, as follows: \"We ascended the Mississippi  to Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day we  landed again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer.\"    [Note 12: Ibid., pp. 88-91.]    The presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was observed  and recorded by D'Iberville in 1699.[13]    [Note 13: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, French, second series,  p. 58.]    According to Claiborne,[14] the Choctaws have an interesting tradition  in regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It  relates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great  drought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region.  For three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee  Rivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which up  to that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond the  Mississippi, and never returned.    [Note 14: Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State, p. 484.]    TEXAS.--It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, in all  probability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that the  earliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was"]]]
