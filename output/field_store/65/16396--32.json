The leaves are arranged on little stalks, a characteristic that does      not appear in the other evergreen trees.    Form and size: A large tree with a broad-based pyramidal head, and a      trunk conspicuously tapering toward the apex. The branches extend      almost to the ground.    Range: The hemlock is a northern tree, growing in Canada and the United      States.    Soil and location: Grows on all sorts of soils, in the deepest woods as      well as on high mountain slopes.    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: The hemlock makes an excellent hedge because it      retains its lowest branches and will stand shearing. In this respect      it is preferable to the spruce. It makes a fair tree for the lawn      and is especially desirable for underplanting in woodlands, where      the shade from the surrounding trees is heavy. In this respect it is      like the beech.    Commercial value: The wood is soft, brittle, and coarse-grained, and is      therefore used mainly for coarse lumber. Its bark is so rich in      tannin that it forms one of the chief commercial products of the      tree.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about 3/4 of an inch long,      which generally hangs on the tree all winter.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Twig of the Hemlock.]        GROUP III. THE RED CEDAR AND ARBOR-VITAE    How to tell them from other trees: The red cedar (juniper) and      arbor-vitae may be told from other trees by their _leaves_, which      remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entire year. These      leaves differ from those of the other evergreens in being much      shorter and of a distinctive shape as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. The      trees themselves are much smaller than the other evergreens      enumerated in this book. Altogether, there are thirty-five species      of juniper recognized and four of arbor-vitae. The junipers are      widely distributed over the northern hemisphere, from the Arctic      region down to Mexico in the New World, and in northern Africa,      China, and Japan in the Old World. The arbor-vitae is found in      northeastern and northwestern America, China, and Japan. The species      mentioned here are those commonly found in America.    How to tell them from each other: The _twigs_ of the arbor-vitae are      _flat and fan-like_ as in Fig. 13; the twigs of the red cedar are      _needle-shaped or scale-like_ as in Fig. 12. The foliage of the      arbor-vitae is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar, which      is sombre green. The arbor-vitae will generally be found growing in      moist locations, while the red cedar will grow in dry places as      well. The arbor-vitae generally retains its lower branches in open      places, while the branches of the red cedar start at some distance      from the ground.      RED CEDAR (_Juniperus virginiana_)    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Red Cedar.]    Distinguishing characters: The tree can best be told at a glance by its      general form, size and leaves. It is a medium-sized tree with a      _symmetrical, cone-like form_, Fig. 11, which, however, broadens      out somewhat when the tree grows old. Its color throughout the year      is dull green with a tinge of brownish red, and its bark peels in      thin strips.    [Illustration:  FIG. 12(a).--Twig of Young Cedar.  FIG. 12(b).--Twig of Cedar (Older Tree).]    Leaf: In young trees the leaf is needle-shaped, pointed, and marked by a      white line on its under side, Fig. 12(a). In older trees it is      scale-like, Fig. 12(b), and the white line on its under side is      indistinct.    Range: Widely distributed over nearly all of eastern and central North      America.    Soil and location: Grows on poor, gravelly soils as well as in rich      bottom lands.    Enemies: The \"_cedar apple_,\" commonly found on this tree, represents a      stage of the apple rust, and for that reason it is not desirable to      plant such trees near orchards. Its wood is also sometimes attacked      by small _boring insects_.    Value for planting: Its characteristic slender form gives the red cedar      an important place as an ornamental tree, but its chief value lies      in its commercial use.    Commercial value: The wood is durable, light, smooth and fragrant, and      is therefore used for making lead-pencils, cabinets, boxes,      moth-proof chests, shingles, posts, and telegraph poles.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is small, round and berry-like, about the      size of a pea, of dark blue color, and carries from one to four bony      seeds.    Other common names: The red cedar is also often called _juniper_ and      _red juniper_.    Comparisons: The red cedar is apt to be confused with the _low juniper_      (_Juniperus communis_) which grows in open fields all over the      world. The latter, however, is generally of a low form with a flat      top. Its leaves are pointed and prickly, never scale-like, and they      are whitish above and green below. Its bark shreds and its fruit is      a small round berry of agreeable aromatic odor.      ARBOR-VITAE; NORTHERN WHITE CEDAR (_Thuja occidentalis_)    Distinguishing characters: The *branchlets* are extremely *flat and      fan-like*, Fig. 13, and have an agreeable _aromatic odor_ when      bruised. The tree is an evergreen with a _narrow conical form_.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Twig of the Arbor-vitae.]    Leaf: Leaves of two kinds, one scale-like and flat, the other keeled,      all tightly pressed to the twig (see Fig. 13).    Form and size: A close, conical head with dense foliage near the base.      Usually a small tree, but in some parts of the northeastern States      it grows to medium size with a diameter of two feet.    Range: Northern part of North America.    Soil and location: Inhabits low, swampy lands; in the State of Maine      often forming thick forests.    Enemies: Very seldom affected by insects.    Value for planting: Is hardy in New England, where it is especially used      for hedges. It is also frequently used as a specimen tree on the      lawn.    Commercial value: The wood is durable for posts, ties, and shingles. The      bark contains considerable tannin and the juices from the tree have      a medicinal value.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone about 1/2 inch long.    Other common names: Arbor-vitae is sometimes called _white cedar_ and      _cedar_.    Comparisons: The arbor-vitae is apt to be confused with the true _white      cedar_ (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_) but the leaves of the latter are      sharp-pointed and not flattened or fan-shaped.          CHAPTER II    HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)        GROUP IV. THE LARCH AND CYPRESS    How to tell them from other trees: In summer the larch and cypress may      easily be told from other trees by their _leaves_. These are      needle-shaped and arranged in clusters with numerous leaves to each      cluster in the case of the larch, and feathery and flat in the case      of the cypress. In winter, when their leaves have dropped off, the      trees can be told by their cones, which adhere to the branches.        There are nine recognized species of larch and two of bald cypress.      The larch is characteristically a northern tree, growing in the      northern and mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere from the      Arctic circle to Pennsylvania in the New World, and in Central      Europe, Asia, and Japan in the Old World. It forms large forests in      the Alps of Switzerland and France.        The European larch and not the American is the principal species      considered here, because it is being planted extensively in this      country and in most respects is preferable to the American species.        The bald cypress is a southern tree of ancient origin, the      well-known cypress of Montezuma in the gardens of Chepultepec having      been a species of Taxodium. The tree is now confined to the swamps      and river banks of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, where it      often forms extensive forests to the exclusion of all other trees.      In those regions along the river swamps, the trees are often      submerged for several months of the year.    How to tell them from each other: In summer the larch may be told from      the cypress by its leaves (compare Figs. 14 and 16). In winter the      two can be distinguished by their characteristic forms. The larch is      a broader tree as compared with the cypress and its form is more      conical. The cypress is more slender and it is taller. The two have      been grouped together in this study because they are both coniferous      trees and, unlike the other Conifers, are both deciduous, their      leaves falling in October.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Twig of the Larch in Summer.]      THE EUROPEAN LARCH (_Larix europaea_)    Distinguishing characters: Its leaves, which are needle-shaped and about      an inch long, are borne in *clusters* close to the twig, Fig. 14.      There are many leaves to each cluster. This characteristic together      with the *spire-like* form of the crown will distinguish the tree at      a glance.    Leaf: The leaves are of a light-green color but become darker in the      spring and in October turn yellow and drop off. The cypress, which      is described below, is another cone-bearing tree which sheds its      leaves in winter.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Twig of the Larch in Winter.]    Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a conical head and a straight      and tapering trunk. (See Fig. 90.)    Range: Central Europe and eastern and central United States.    Soil and location: Requires a deep, fresh, well-drained soil and needs      plenty of light. It flourishes in places where our native species      would die. Grows very rapidly.    Enemies: The larch is subject to the attacks of a _sawfly_, which has      killed many trees of the American species. A "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#3)"],[1,"hirino's note, there is no record anywhere that  works by him existed, nor do the Augustinian chroniclers themselves,  except for the modern Santiago Vela who knew of Chirino's citation,  mention him as a linguist or a writer. The only possibility is that  between 1593 and 1599 Villanueva had printed some small xylographic  books no copies and no further record of which have appeared.    As for Francisco de San Joseph, or Blancas de San Jose as he is more  frequently called, there are other references to his part in the  establishment of printing in the islands. From information doubtless  obtained from Diego Aduarte, then in Spain, Alonso Fernandez wrote  in his ecclesiastical history, printed at Toledo in 1611:          \"Father Fr. Francisco Blancas printed in the Tagalog language      and characters a book of Our Lady of the Rosary in the year      1602, which was the first book that was printed there of      that or any other material. After this he printed another of      the sacraments in the language of the Philippines, in both      characters, theirs and ours, from which the greatest results      have been achieved.\" [17]      Two years later the same author published at Madrid an account [18]  of the miracles performed by the Rosary of the Virgin, in which he  included a list of \"Of some writers of the Order of St. Dominic who  were living in this year 1612,\" and gave the same information as above,  adding only that the printing took place in Bataan.    Diego Aduarte, [19] whose history of the Dominican province of the  Philippines is one of the best contemporary ones written, bears out  these statements of which he was most probably the source. Aduarte came  to the islands in company with his close friend Blancas de San Jose  in 1595, went back to Spain as procurator of his order in 1607, and  returned to Manila in 1628, staying in the Orient until his death in  1636. His history was continued and edited after his death by a fellow  Dominican, Domingo Goncalez, who had it printed in 1640. Summarizing  the life and accomplishments of Blancas de San Jose, Aduarte wrote:          \"So he was sent to Bataan, which is near there [Manila],      where he learned the language of the Indians, called Tagalog,      which is the most common in this country and is used among the      Indians for many leagues around the city. So rapid was his      study of the language that he began to preach in it within      three months, and could teach it to others in six.... And      believing that he was the instrument needed to bring the holy      gospel to the Indians, he spared no pains to investigate the      fitness of their words, the way to use them, and all the rest      so that he could succeed in mastering it.... He wrote many      books of devotion for them, and since there was no printing      in these islands, and no one who understood it or who was      a journeyman printer, he planned to have it done through a      Chinaman, a good Christian, who, seeing that the books of      P. Fr. Francisco were sure to be of great use, bestowed so      much care upon this undertaking that he finally succeeded,      aided by those who told him whatever they knew about it,      in learning everything necessary to do printing; and he      printed these books. . . . He [Blancas de San Jose] printed      a grammar to learn the Tagalog language, a memorial of the      Christian life, a book on the four last things, another on the      preparation for the communion, a confessionary, another on the      mysteries of the Rosary of Our Lady, and another to teach the      Tagalog Indians the Spanish language, and he left many very      pious and curious works in the language of these Indians.\" [20]      Blancas de San Jose, [21] as we have noted, came to the Philippines in  1595. He was at Abucay in Bataan from 1598 until 1602, and then spent  several years in and about Manila, preaching to the Indians and the  Chinese, whose language he also mastered. In 1614 he set out for Spain,  but died on the voyage before reaching Mexico. Of the books which he is  said to have had printed, only two are known to be extant, the _Arte  y Reglas de la Lengva Tagala_ [22] and the _Librong Pagaaralan nang  manga Tagalog nang uicang Castilla_ [23] (or _Libro en qve aprendan  los Tagalos, la lengua Castellana_), both printed at Bataan in 1610,  and until the discovery of the present Doctrina and the _Ordinationes_  of 1604 the earliest surviving Philippine imprints known.    We have not cited here in detail the account of Juan Lopez [24] in  the fifth part of his history of the Dominicans, because, although it  was printed nineteen years before the appearance of Aduarte's work,  the information therein contained regarding the Philippines was  acknowledgedly obtained from the unfinished manuscript which Aduarte  had with him in Spain. The pertinent passages add nothing to Aduarte's  information, and even the wording is reminiscent of his.    The first suggestion that early Philippine books may have been printed  from wood-blocks occurred in Quetif and Echard's bibliography of  Dominican writers printed at Paris in 1719. There, after listing  eight works by Blancas de San Jose, they add:          \"He published all these in the Philippines with the help      of a Chinese Christian using Chinese blocks, for in his day      European typographers had not yet arrived in those islands,      nor did they have types for their language.\" [25]      This was an amazing suggestion, for as far as we know the  bibliographers who made it had not actually seen the books; nor is it  entirely true. The first two works listed are two books we know were  printed typographically in 1610. The sixth is _De los mysterios del  Rosario de nuestra Senora Tagalice_, the book referred to by Fernandez  as having been printed in 1602, and generally accepted as being from  movable type, although no copy has been discovered to prove it. And  yet, it is not at all impossible that some time before 1602 Blancas de  San Jose had some of his writings printed from blocks. In any event,  the idea, later developed by Medina and Retana, that xylography was  used before a real printing-press was established, may have come from  this not wholly accurate note.    For almost a hundred and fifty years no historian or bibliographer  wrote anything to challenge the basic affirmations of Chirino,  Fernandez and Aduarte. In the middle of the 18th century, Lorenzo  Hervas y Panduro, [26] a Jesuit, was forced by the expulsion of the  Jesuits from Spain to seek refuge in the Papal States, and took up  residence at Cesena. There he began work on a tremendous universal  history of the spiritual development of man, into which he wove the  results of his philosophical, social and linguistic studies. These  last were of particular importance, and Hervas is regarded as the true  founder of the science of linguistics and comparative philology. In  1785 he published the eighteenth volume of his massive work, the  _Origine, formazione, meccanismo, ed armonia degl' idiomi_, in which  he printed a Tagalog Ave Maria as written in 1593, with the note:          \"The Ave Maria in the Tagalog of 1593 is to be read in the      Tagalog-Spanish Doctrina Christiana which was printed in      Tagalog and roman characters by the Dominican fathers in      their printing-house at Manila in the year 1593.\" [27]      In 1787 he finished his twenty-first volume, _Saggio pratico_, [28]  which was another philological study, including the Pater Noster  in over three hundred languages and dialects, among them Tagalog,  again from the 1593 Doctrina. Here, then, is ample proof that a copy  of this book was known to Hervas in 1785, and the only information  which his loose transcription of the title failed to give was that  the volume was \"corrected by members of the orders,\" that it was  printed with license, and that it was printed at San Gabriel.    At the beginning of the following century two German scholars, familiar  with Hervas' writings, noted the 1593 Doctrina. Franz Carl Alter, [29]  in his monograph on the Tagalog language, printed the Ave Maria from  the text which had appeared in 1785, and Johann Christoph Adelung,  [30] in his _Mithridates_, a comprehensive study of languages,  included the Tagalog Pater Noster from the _Saggio pratico_ of  1787. The latter also listed in a short bibliography of the Tagalog  language the Doctrina of 1593, giving exactly the same information  about it that Hervas had. Neither of these men apparently saw a copy  of the book, limiting themselves to extracts from Hervas, but they  perpetuated an earlier reference of the utmost importance.    Shortly after the two Germans published their notices of the 1593  Doctrina an entry appeared of a book printed at Manila in 1581. Jose  Mariano Beristain y Sousa, a learned Mexican writer, issued in  1819-21 a bibliography of Spanish-American books, in which he listed  alphabetically the authors, giving a short biography of each and  adding a list of his works. Under Juan de Quinones we find:          \"'Arte y Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala,' Imp. en Manila,      1581.\" [31]      No specific authority is given for this entry, but in his sketch of  the life of Quinones Beristain cited as sources, Juan de Grijalva,  Nicolas Antonio, Gaspar de San Agustin, and Jose Sicardo. It would  seem logical that one of these must have mentioned such a work as  printed in Manila in 1581, but in tracing down the sources no such  precise notice is found.    Grijalva simply said that Quinones \"concerned himself with Tagalog and  made a vocabulary and grammar of it.\" [32] Antonio [33] referred to  Grijalva, and carried the matter no further. San Agustin, describing  the Franciscan chapter of 1578, wrote:          \"It was determined moreover in this chapter that P. Fr. Juan      de Quinones, prior of the Convent of Taal in Tagalos, and      Fr. Diego de Ochoa, prior of"]]]
