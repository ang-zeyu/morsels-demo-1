The government felt that it might help to calm them if a  regiment were recruited and sent to Mesopotamia. How they would do in  actual fighting had never been demonstrated up to the time I left the  country, but they take readily to drill, and it was amusing to hear them  ordering each other about in their clipped English. They were used for  garrisoning Baghdad.    After we left Amara we continued our winding course up-stream. A boat  several hours ahead may be seen only a few hundred yards distant across  the desert. The banks are so flat and level that it looks as if the other  vessels were steaming along on land. The Arab river-craft was most  picturesque. At sunset a mahela, bearing down with filled sail, might  have been the model for Maxfield Parrish's _Pirate Ship_. The Arab women  ran along the bank beside us, carrying baskets of eggs and chickens, and  occasionally melons. They were possessed of surprising endurance, and  would accompany us indefinitely, heavily laden as they were. Their robes  trailed in the wind as they jumped ditches, screaming out their wares  without a moment's pause. An Indian of the boat's crew was haggling with a  woman about a chicken. He threw her an eight-anna piece. She picked up the  money but would not hand him the chicken, holding out for her original  price. He jumped ashore, intending to take the chicken. She had a few  yards' start and made the most of it. In and out they chased, over hedge  and ditch, down the bank and up again. Several times he almost had her.  She never for a moment ceased screeching--an operation which seemed to  affect her wind not a particle. At the end of fifteen minutes the Indian  gave up amid the delighted jeers of his comrades, and returned shamefaced  and breathless to jump aboard the boat as we bumped against the bank on  rounding a curve.    One evening we halted where, not many months before, the last of the  battles of Sunnaiyat had been fought. There for months the British had  been held back, while their beleaguered comrades in Kut could hear the  roar of the artillery and hope against hope for the relief that never  reached them. It was one phase of the campaign that closely approximated  the gruelling trench warfare in France. The last unsuccessful attack was  launched a week before the capitulation of the garrison, and it was almost  a year later before the position was eventually taken. The front-line  trenches were but a short distance apart, and each side had developed a  strong and elaborate system of defense. One flank was protected by an  impassable marsh and the other by the river. When we passed, the field  presented an unusually gruesome appearance even for a battle-field, for  the wandering desert Arabs had been at work, and they do not clean up as  thoroughly as the African hyena. A number had paid the penalty through  tampering with unexploded grenades and \"dud\" shells, and left their own  bones to be scattered around among the dead they had been looting. The  trenches were a veritable Golgotha with skulls everywhere and dismembered  legs still clad with puttees and boots.    At Kut we disembarked to do the remaining hundred miles to Baghdad by rail  instead of winding along for double the distance by river, with a good  chance of being hung up for hours, or even days, on some shifting  sand-bar. At first sight Kut is as unpromising a spot as can well be  imagined, with its scorching heat and its sand and the desolate  mud-houses, but in spite of appearances it is an important and thriving  little town, and daily becoming of more consequence.    The railroad runs across the desert, following approximately the old  caravan route to Baghdad. A little over half-way the line passes the  remaining arch of the great hall of Ctesiphon. This hall is one hundred  and forty-eight feet long by seventy-six broad. The arch stands  eighty-five feet high. Around it, beneath the mounds of desert sand, lies  all that remains of the ancient city. As a matter of fact the city is by  no means ancient as such things go in Mesopotamia, dating as it does from  the third century B.C., when it was founded by the successors of Alexander  the Great.    My first night in Baghdad I spent in General Maude's house, on the  river-bank. The general was a striking soldierly figure of a man, standing  well over six feet. His military career was long and brilliant. His first  service was in the Coldstream Guards. He distinguished himself in South  Africa. Early in the present war he was severely wounded in France. Upon  recovering he took over the Thirteenth Division, which he commanded in the  disastrous Gallipoli campaign, and later brought out to Mesopotamia. When  he reached the East the situation was by no means a happy one for the  British. General Townshend was surrounded in Kut, and the morale of the  Turk was excellent after the successes he had met with in Gallipoli. In  the end of August, 1916, four months after the fall of Kut, General Maude  took over the command of the Mesopotamian forces. On the 11th of March of  the following year he occupied Baghdad, thereby re-establishing completely  the British prestige in the Orient. One of Germany's most serious  miscalculations was with regard to the Indian situation. She felt  confident that, working through Persia and Afghanistan, she could stir up  sufficient trouble, possibly to completely overthrow British rule, but  certainly to keep the English so occupied with uprisings as to force them  to send troops to India rather than withdraw them thence for use  elsewhere. The utter miscarriage of Germany's plans is, indeed, a fine  tribute to Great Britain. The Emir of Afghanistan did probably more than  any single native to thwart German treachery and intrigue, and every  friend of the Allied cause must have read of his recent assassination with  a very real regret.    When General Maude took over the command, the effect of the Holy War that,  at the Kaiser's instigation, was being preached in the mosques had not as  yet been determined. This jehad, as it was called, proposed to unite all  \"True Believers\" against the invading Christians, and give the war a  strongly religious aspect. The Germans hoped by this means to spread  mutiny among the Mohammedan troops, which formed such an appreciable  element of the British forces, as well as to fire the fury of the Turks  and win as many of the Arabs to their side as possible. The Arab  thoroughly disliked both sides. The Turk oppressed him, but did so in an  Oriental, and hence more or less comprehensible, manner. The English gave  him justice, but it was an Occidental justice that he couldn't at first  understand or appreciate, and he was distinctly inclined to mistrust it.  In course of time he would come to realize its advantages. Under Turkish  rule the Arab was oppressed by the Turk, but then he in turn could oppress  the Jew, the Chaldean, and Nestorian Christians, and the wretched  Armenian. Under British rule he suddenly found these latter on an equal  footing with him, and he felt that this did not compensate the lifting  from his shoulders of the Turkish burden. Then, too, when a race has been  long oppressed and downtrodden, and suddenly finds itself on an equality  with its oppressor, it is apt to become arrogant and overbearing. This is  exactly what happened, and there was bad feeling on all sides in  consequence. However, real fundamental justice is appreciated the world  over, once the native has been educated up to it, and can trust in its  continuity.    The complex nature of the problems facing the army commander can be  readily seen. He was an indefatigable worker and an unsurpassed organizer.  The only criticism I ever heard was that he attended too much to the  details himself and did not take his subordinates sufficiently into his  confidence. A brilliant leader, beloved by his troops, his loss was a  severe blow to the Allied cause.    Baghdad is often referred to as the great example of the shattered  illusion. We most of us have read the _Arabian Nights_ at an early age,  and think of the abode of the caliphs as a dream city, steeped in what we  have been brought up to think of as the luxury, romance, and glamour of  the East. Now glamour is a delicate substance. In the all-searching glare  of the Mesopotamian sun it is apt to appear merely tawdry. Still, a goodly  number of years spent in wandering about in foreign lands had prepared me  for a depreciation of the \"stuff that dreams are made of,\" and I was not  disappointed. It is unfortunate that the normal way to approach is from  the south, and that that view of the city is flat and uninteresting.  Coming, as I several times had occasion to, from the north, one first  catches sight of great groves of date-palms, with the tall minarets of the  Mosque of Kazimain towering above them; then a forest of minarets and blue  domes, with here and there some graceful palm rising above the flat roofs  of Baghdad. In the evening when the setting sun strikes the towers and the  tiled roofs, and the harsh lights are softened, one is again in the land  of Haroun-el-Raschid.    The great covered bazaars are at all times capable of \"eating the hours,\"  as the natives say. One could sit indefinitely in a coffee-house and watch  the throngs go by--the stalwart Kurdish porter with his impossible loads,  the veiled women, the unveiled Christian or lower-class Arab women, the  native police, the British Tommy, the kilted Scot, the desert Arab, all  these and many more types wandered past. Then there was the gold and  silver market, where the Jewish and Armenian artificers squatted beside  their charcoal fires and haggled endlessly with their customers. These  latter were almost entirely women, and they came both to buy and sell,  bringing old bracelets and anklets, and probably spending the proceeds on  something newer that had taken their fancy.

Why can't we start at once--in the  morning? This gentleman can guide us to the place, and--\"    \"It ain't easy going,\" Andy remarked, conscientiously. \"It's pretty  rough; some places, you'd have to walk and lead your horses.\"    They swept aside the discouragement.    \"We'd need pick and shovels, and men to dig,\" cried one enthusiast.  \"Uncle Peter can lend us some of his men. There may be treasure to  unearth. There may be _anything_ that is wonderful and mysterious. Get  busy, Uncle Peter, and get your outfit together; you've boasted that a  roundup can beat the army in getting under way quickly, now let us  have a practical demonstration. We want to start by six o'clock--all  of us, with a cook and four or five men to do the excavating. Bring it  to pass!\" It was the voice of the girl whom her friends spoke of as  \"The life of the party;\" the voice of the-girl-who-does-things.    \"It's sixty-five miles from here, good and strong--and mostly up and  down,\" put in Andy.    \"'Quoth the raven,'\" mocked the-girl-who-does-things. \"We are prepared  to face the ups-and-downs. Do we start at six, Uncle Peter?\"    Uncle Peter glanced sideways at the roundup boss. To bring it to pass,  he would be obliged to impress the roundup cook and part of the crew.  It was breaking an unwritten law of the rangeland, and worse, it was  doing something unbusiness-like and foolish. But not even the owner of  the Rocking R may withstand the pleading of a pretty woman. Uncle  Peter squirmed, but he promised:    \"We start at six; earlier if you say so.\"    The roundup boss gave his employer a look of disgust and walked away;  the crew took it that he went off to some secluded place to swear.    Thereafter there was much discussion of ways and means, and much  enthusiasm among the visitors from the East--equalled by the  depression of the crew, for cowboys do not, as a rule, take kindly to  pick and shovel, and the excavators had not yet been chosen from among  them. They were uneasy, and they stole frequent, betraying glances at  one another. All of which amused Pink much. Pink would like to have  gone along, and would certainly have offered his services, but for the  fact that his work there was done and he would have to start back to  the Flying U just as soon as one of his best saddle horses, which had  stepped on a broken beer bottle and cut its foot, was able to travel.  That would be in a few days, probably. So Pink sighed and watched the  preparations enviously.    Since he was fairly committed into breaking all precedents, uncle  Peter plunged recklessly. He ordered the mess-wagon to be restocked  and prepared for the trip, and he took the bed-tent and half the crew.  The foreman he wisely left behind with the remnant of his outfit. They  were all to eat at the house while the mess-wagon was away, and they  were to spread their soogans--which is to say beds--where they might,  if the bunk-house proved too small or too hot.    The foreman, outraged beyond words, saddled at daybreak and rode to  the nearest town, and the unchosen half turned out in a body to watch  the departure of the explorers, which speaks eloquently of their  interest; for cowboys off duty are prone to sleep long.    Andy, as guide, bolted ahead of the party that he might open the gate.  Bolted is a good word, for his horse swerved and kept on running,  swerved again, and came down in a heap. Andy did not get up, and the  women screamed. Then Pink and some others hurried out and bore Andy,  groaning, to the bunk-house.    The visitors from the East gathered, perturbed, around the door,  sympathetic and dismayed. It looked very much as if their exploration  must end where it began, and the-girl-who-does-things looked about to  weep, until Andy, still groaning, sent Pink out to comfort them.    \"He says you needn't give up the trip on his account,\" Pink announced  musically from the doorway. \"He's drawing a map and marking the coulee  where the ruin is. He says most any of the boys that know the country  at all can find the place for yuh. And he isn't hurt permanent; he  strained his back so he can't ride, is all.\" Pink dimpled at the young  old lady who was admiring him frankly, and withdrew.    Inside, Andy Green was making pencil marks and giving the chosen half  explicit directions. At last he folded the paper and handed it to one  called Sandy.    \"That's the best I can do for yuh,\" he finished. \"I don't see how yuh  can miss it if yuh follow that map close. And if them gay females make  any kick on the trail, you just remind 'em that I said all along it  was rough going. So long, and good luck.\"    So with high-keyed, feminine laughter and much dust, passed the  exploring party from the Rocking R.    \"Say,\" Pink began two days later to Andy, who was sitting on the shady  side of the bunk-house staring absently at the skyline, \"There's a  word uh praise I've been aiming to give yuh. I've seen riding, and  I've done a trifle in that line myself, and learned some uh the  tricks. But I want to say I never did see a man flop his horse any  neater than you done that morning. I'll bet there ain't another man in  the outfit got next your play. I couldn't uh done it better myself.  Where did you learn that? Ever ride in Wyoming?\"    Andy turned his eyes, but not his head--which was a way he had--and  regarded Pink slantwise for at least ten seconds. \"Yes, I've rode in  Wyoming,\" he answered quietly. Then: \"What's the chance for a job, up  your way? Is the Flying U open for good men and true?\"    \"It won't cost yuh a cent to try,\" Pink told him. \"How's your back?  Think you'll be able to ride by the time Skeeker is able to travel?\"    Andy, grinned. \"Say,\" he confided suddenly, \"if that hoss don't  improve some speedy, I'll be riding on ahead. I reckon I'll be able to  travel before them explorers get back, my friend.\"    \"Why?\" dimpled Pink boldly.    \"Why? Well, the going is some rough, down that way. If they get them  wagons half way to the coulee marked with a cross, they'll sure have  to attach wings onto 'em. I've been some worried about that. I don't  much believe uncle Peter is going to enjoy that trip--and he sure does  get irritable by spells. I've got a notion to ride for some other  outfit, this summer.\"    \"Was that the reason you throwed your horse down and got hurt, that  morning?\" questioned Pink, and Andy grinned again by way of reply.    \"They'll be gone a week, best they can do,\" he estimated aloud. \"We  ought to be able to make our getaway by then, easy.\"    Pink assured him that a week would see them headed for the Flying U.    It was the evening of the sixth day, and the two were packed and ready  to leave in the morning, when Andy broke off humming and gave a snort  of dismay. \"By gracious, there they come. My mother lives in Buffalo,  Pink, in a little drab house with white trimmings. Write and tell her  how her son--Oh, beloved! but they're hitting her up lively. If they  made the whole trip in that there frame uh mind, they could uh gone  clean to Miles City and back. How pretty the birds sing! Pink, you'll  hear words, directly.\"    Directly Pink did.    \"You're the biggest liar on earth,\" Sherwood Branciforte contributed  to the recriminating wave that near engulfed Andy Green. \"You sent us  down there on a wild-goose chase, you brute. You--\"    \"I never sent nobody,\" Andy defended. \"You was all crazy to go.\"    \"And nothing but an old stone hut some trapper had built!\" came an  indignant, female tone. \"There never was any castle, nor--\"    \"A man's home is his castle,\" argued Andy, standing unabashed before  them. \"Putting it that way, it was a castle, all right.\"    There was babel, out of which--    \"And the skeleton! Oh, you--it was a dead _cow!_\" This from the young  old lady, who was looking very draggled and not at all young.    \"I don't call to mind ever saying it was human,\" put in Andy, looking  at her with surprised, gray eyes.    \"And the battlements!\" groaned the-girl-who-does-things.    \"You wanted battlements,\" Andy flung mildly into the uproar. \"I always  aim to please.\" With that he edged away from them and made his escape  to where the cook was profanely mixing biscuits for supper. All-day  moves put an edge to his temper. The cook growled an epithet, and Andy  passed on. Down near the stable he met one of the chosen half, and the  fellow greeted him with a grin. Andy stopped abruptly.    \"Say, they don't seem none too agreeable,\" he began tentatively,  jerking his thumb toward the buzzing group. \"How about it, Sandy? Was  they that petulant all the way?\"    Sandy, the map-bearer, chuckled. \"It's lucky you got hurt at the last  minute! And yet it was worth the trip. Uh course we got stalled with  the wagons, the second day out, but them women was sure ambitious, and  made us go on with a packadero layout. I will say that, going down,  they stood the hardships remarkable. It was coming back that frazzled  the party.    \"And when we found the place--say, but it was lucky you wasn't along!  They sure went hog-wild when they seen the ruins. The old party with  the pompadoor displayed temper, and shed tears uh rage. When she  looked into the cabin and seen the remains uh that cow-critter, there  was language it wasn't polite to overhear. She said a lot uh things  about you, Andy. One thing they couldn't seem to get over, and that  was the smallness uh the blamed shack. Them fourteen or fifteen rooms  laid heavy on their minds.\"    \"I didn't say there was fourteen or fifteen rooms. I said I didn't  count the rooms; I didn't either. I never heard of anybody counting  one room. Did you, Pink?\"    \"No,\" Pink agreed, \"I never did!\"    Sandy became suddenly convulsed. \"Oh, but the funniest thing was the  ancient pottery,\" he gasped, the tears standing in his eyes. \"That old  Dutch oven was bad enough; but when one uh the"]]]
