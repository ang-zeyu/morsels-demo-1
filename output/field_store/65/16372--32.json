Yes, I agree that  octaves are a most necessary and important factor in the player's  technical equipment.\"    Going to the piano and illustrating as he talked, Mr. Schelling  continued:    \"Merely flopping the hand up and down, as many do, is of little use--it  does not lead to strength or velocity. As you see, I hold the hand  arched and very firm, and the firmness is in the fingers as well; the  hand makes up and down movements with loose wrist; the result is a full,  bright, crisp tone. One can play these octaves slowly, using weight, or  faster with crisp, staccato touch. I play diatonic or chromatic octave  scales, with four repetitions or more, on each note--using fourth finger  for black keys.    \"I sit low at the piano, as I get better results in this way; though it  is somewhat more difficult to obtain them. I confess it is easier to sit  high and bear down on the hands. Yes, I thoroughly approve of 'weight  touch,' and it is the touch I generally use. Sometimes it is a certain  pressure on the key after it is played, using arm weight.    \"Ah, you are right. The young teacher or player, in listening to the  artist, and noticing he does not lift his fingers to any extent, and  that he always plays with weight, hastily concludes these are the  principles with which he must begin to study or teach the piano. It is  a mistake to begin in that way. Very exact finger movements must be  learned in the beginning. As I said before, technic is such an  individual matter, that after the first period of foundational training,  one who has the desire to become an artist, must work out things for  himself. There should be no straight-laced methods. Only a few general  rules can be laid down, such as will fit most cases. The player who  would rise to any distinction must work out his own salvation.    \"In regard to memorizing piano music, it may be said this can be  accomplished in three ways: namely, with the eye, with the ear, and with  the hand. For example: I take the piece and read it through with the  eye, just as I would read a book. I get familiar with the notes in this  way, and see how they look in print. I learn to know them so well that I  have a mental photograph of them, and if necessary could recall any  special measure or phrase so exactly that I could write it. All this  time my mental ear has been hearing those notes, and is familiar with  them. Then the third stage arrives; I must put all this on the keyboard,  my fingers must have their training; impressions must pass from the mind  to the fingers; then all is complete.\"          III    ERNESTO CONSOLO    MAKING THE PIANO A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT      In a long conversation with Ernesto Consolo, the eminent pianist and  instructor, many points of vital importance to the player and teacher  were touched upon. Among other things Mr. Consolo said:    \"It is absolutely necessary that the piano teacher should take his  profession very seriously. In my opinion there is most excellent  instruction to be secured right here in America, with such teachers as  are willing to take their work seriously. The time is not far away, I  think, when America will enjoy a very prominent position in the matter  of musical instruction, and perhaps lead the world in musical  advantages. The time is not here just yet, but it is surely coming. You  are still young in this country, though you are wonderfully progressive.    \"If I have spoken of the serious aims of many teachers of piano, I  cannot say as much for the students: they are often superficial and want  to go too quickly; they are apt to be in a hurry and want to make a  show, without being willing to spend the necessary years on preparation.  No art can be hurried. Students of painting, sculpture, architecture or  music must all learn the technique of their art; they must all learn to  go deep into the mysteries and master technic as the means to the end,  and no one requires exhaustive preparation more than the executive  musician. The person who would fence, box or play baseball must know the  technic of these things; how much more must the pianist be master of the  technique of his instrument if he would bring out the best results.    \"At the very bottom and heart of this subject of mastery lies  Concentration: without that, little of value can be accomplished.  Students think if they sit at the piano and 'practise' a certain number  of hours daily, it is sufficient. A small portion of that time, if used  with intense concentration, will accomplish more. One player will take  hours to learn a page or a passage which another will master in a  fraction of the time. What is the difference? It may be said one has  greater intelligence than the other. The greater the intelligence, the  stronger the power of concentration.    \"If a pupil comes to me whose powers of concentration have not been  awakened or developed, I sometimes give him music to read over very  slowly, so slowly that every note, phrase and finger mark can be  distinctly seen. Not being used to thinking intently, mistakes occur, in  one hand or the other, showing that the mind was not sufficiently  concentrated. It is the mind every time that wins. Without using our  mental powers to their fullest extent we fail of the best that is in us.    \"In regard to technical equipment and routine, I do different work with  each pupil, for each pupil is different. No two people have the same  hands, physique or mentality; so why should they all be poured into the  same mold? One student, for example, has splendid wrists and not very  good fingers. Why should I give him the same amount of wrist practise  that I give his brother who has feeble wrists; it would only be a waste  of time. Again, a pupil with limited ideas of tonal quality and dynamics  is advised to study tone at the piano in some simple melody of Schubert  or Chopin, trying to realize a beautiful tone--playing it in various  ways until such a quality Is secured. The piano is a responsive  instrument and gives back what you put into it. If you attack it with a  hard touch, it will respond with a harsh tone. It rests with you whether  the piano shall be a musical instrument or not.    \"A student who comes to me with a very poor touch must of course go back  to first principles and work up. Such an one must learn correct  movements and conditions of hands, arms and fingers; and these can be  acquired at a table. Along with these, however, I would always give some  simple music to play, so that the tonal and musical sense shall not be  neglected.    \"Of course I advise comprehensive scale practise; scales in all keys and  in various rhythms and touches. There is an almost endless variety of  ways to play scales. Those in double thirds and sixths I use later,  after the others are under control. Arpeggios are also included in this  scale practise.    \"I have said that Concentration is the keynote of piano mastery. Another  principle which goes hand in hand with it is Relaxation. Unless this  condition is present in arms, wrist and shoulders, the tone will be hard  and the whole performance constrained and unmusical. There is no need  of having tired muscles or those that feel strained or painful. If this  condition arises it is proof that there is stiffness, that relaxation  has not taken place. I can sit at the piano and play _forte_ for three  hours at a time and not feel the least fatigue in hands and arms.  Furthermore, the playing of one who is relaxed, who knows how to use his  anatomy, will not injure the piano. We must remember the piano is a  thing of joints; the action is so delicately adjusted that it moves with  absolute freedom and ease. The player but adds another joint, which  should equal in ease and adjustment the ones already there. On the other  hand a person with stiff joints and rigid muscles, thumping ragtime on a  good piano, can ruin it in a week; whereas under the fingers of a player  who understands the laws of relaxation, it would last for many years.    \"This principle of relaxation is exemplified in the athlete, baseball  player, and others. They have poise and easy adjustment in every part of  the body: they never seem to fall into strained or stiff attitudes, nor  make angular or stiff movements. Arms, shoulders, wrists and fingers are  all relaxed and easy. The pianist needs to study these principles as  well as the athlete, I believe in physical exercises to a certain  extent. Light-weight dumb-bells can be used; it is surprising how light  a weight is sufficient to accomplish the result. But it must be one  movement at a time, exercising one muscle at a time, and not various  muscles at once.    \"For memorizing piano music I can say I have no method whatever. When I  know the piece technically or mechanically, I know it by heart. I really  do not know when the memorizing takes place. The music is before me on  the piano; I forget to turn the pages, and thus find I know the piece.  In playing with orchestra I know the parts of all instruments, unless it  be just a simple chord accompaniment; it would not interest me to play  with orchestra and not know the music in this way. On one occasion I was  engaged to play the Sgambatti concerto, which I had not played for some  time. I tried it over on the piano and found I could not remember it. My  first idea was to get out the score and go over it; the second was to  try and recall the piece from memory. I tried the latter method, with  the result that in about three hours and a half I had the whole concerto  back in mind. I played the work ten days later without having once  consulted the score. This goes to prove that memory must be absolute and  not merely mechanical.    \"Students think they cannot memorize, when it would be quite easy if  they would apply themselves in the right way. I ask them to look  intently at a small portion, two measures, or even one, and afterward to  play it without looking at the notes.

Doubtless this was a  view much encouraged by the early Church itself--if only to enhance its  own authority and importance; yet, as is well known to every student, it  is quite misleading and contrary to fact. The main Christian doctrines  and festivals, besides a great mass of affiliated legend and ceremonial,  are really quite directly derived from, and related to, preceding  Nature worships; and it has only been by a good deal of deliberate  mystification and falsification that this derivation has been kept out  of sight.    In these Nature-worships there may be discerned three fairly independent  streams of religious or quasi-religious enthusiasm: (1) that connected  with the phenomena of the heavens, the movements of the Sun, planets and  stars, and the awe and wonderment they excited; (2) that connected with  the seasons and the very important matter of the growth of vegetation  and food on the Earth; and (3) that connected with the mysteries of Sex  and reproduction. It is obvious that these three streams would mingle  and interfuse with each other a good deal; but as far as they were  separable the first would tend to create Solar heroes and Sun-myths;  the second Vegetation-gods and personifications of Nature and the  earth-life; while the third would throw its glamour over the other two  and contribute to the projection of deities or demons worshipped with  all sorts of sexual and phallic rites. All three systems of course have  their special rites and times and ceremonies; but, as, I say, the rites  and ceremonies of one system would rarely be found pure and unmixed with  those belonging to the two others. The whole subject is a very large  one; but for reasons given in the Introduction I shall in this and  the following chapter--while not ignoring phases (2) and (3)--lay most  stress on phase (1) of the question before us.    At the time of the life or recorded appearance of Jesus of Nazareth, and  for some centuries before, the Mediterranean and neighboring world had  been the scene of a vast number of pagan creeds and rituals. There were  Temples without end dedicated to gods like Apollo or Dionysus among the  Greeks, Hercules among the Romans, Mithra among the Persians, Adonis and  Attis in Syria and Phrygia, Osiris and Isis and Horus in Egypt, Baal  and Astarte among the Babylonians and Carthaginians, and so forth.  Societies, large or small, united believers and the devout in the  service or ceremonials connected with their respective deities, and  in the creeds which they confessed concerning these deities. And an  extraordinarily interesting fact, for us, is that notwithstanding great  geographical distances and racial differences between the adherents  of these various cults, as well as differences in the details of their  services, the general outlines of their creeds and ceremonials were--if  not identical--so markedly similar as we find them.    I cannot of course go at length into these different cults, but I may  say roughly that of all or nearly all the deities above-mentioned it was  said and believed that:      (1) They were born on or very near our Christmas Day.    (2) They were born of a Virgin-Mother.    (3) And in a Cave or Underground Chamber.    (4) They led a life of toil for Mankind.    (5) And were called by the names of Light-bringer, Healer, Mediator,  Savior, Deliverer.    (6) They were however vanquished by the Powers of Darkness.    (7) And descended into Hell or the Underworld.    (8) They rose again from the dead, and became the pioneers of mankind to  the Heavenly world.    (9) They founded Communions of Saints, and Churches into which disciples  were received by Baptism.    (10) And they were commemorated by Eucharistic meals.      Let me give a few brief examples.    Mithra was born in a cave, and on the 25th December. (1) He was born of  a Virgin. (2) He traveled far and wide as a teacher and illuminator  of men. He slew the Bull (symbol of the gross Earth which the sunlight  fructifies). His great festivals were the winter solstice and the Spring  equinox (Christmas and Easter). He had twelve companions or disciples  (the twelve months). He was buried in a tomb, from which however he rose  again; and his resurrection was celebrated yearly with great rejoicings.  He was called Savior and Mediator, and sometimes figured as a Lamb; and  sacramental feasts in remembrance of him were held by his followers.  This legend is apparently partly astronomical and partly vegetational;  and the same may be said of the following about Osiris.     (1) The birthfeast of Mithra was held in Rome on the 8th day  before the Kalends of January, being also the day of the Circassian  games, which were sacred to the Sun. (See F. Nork, Der Mystagog,  Leipzig.)     (2) This at any rate was reported by his later disciples (see  Robertson's Pagan Christs, p. 338).      Osiris was born (Plutarch tells us) on the 361st day of the year,  say the 27th December. He too, like Mithra and Dionysus, was a great  traveler. As King of Egypt he taught men civil arts, and \"tamed them by  music and gentleness, not by force of arms\"; (1) he was the discoverer  of corn and wine. But he was betrayed by Typhon, the power of darkness,  and slain and dismembered. \"This happened,\" says Plutarch, \"on the 17th  of the month Athyr, when the sun enters into the Scorpion\" (the sign of  the Zodiac which indicates the oncoming of Winter). His body was placed  in a box, but afterwards, on the 19th, came again to life, and, as in  the cults of Mithra, Dionysus, Adonis and others, so in the cult  of Osiris, an image placed in a coffin was brought out before the  worshipers and saluted with glad cries of \"Osiris is risen.\" (1) \"His  sufferings, his death and his resurrection were enacted year by year in  a great mystery-play at Abydos.\" (2)     (1) See Plutarch on Isis and Osiris.     (2) Ancient Art and Ritual, by Jane E. Harrison, chap. i.      The two following legends have more distinctly the character of  Vegetation myths.    Adonis or Tammuz, the Syrian god of vegetation, was a very beautiful  youth, born of a Virgin (Nature), and so beautiful that Venus and  Proserpine (the goddesses of the Upper and Underworlds) both fell in  love with him. To reconcile their claims it was agreed that he should  spend half the year (summer) in the upper world, and the winter half  with Proserpine below. He was killed by a boar (Typhon) in the autumn.  And every year the maidens \"wept for Adonis\" (see Ezekiel viii. 14). In  the spring a festival of his resurrection was held--the women set out  to seek him, and having found the supposed corpse placed it (a wooden  image) in a coffin or hollow tree, and performed wild rites and  lamentations, followed by even wilder rejoicings over his supposed  resurrection. At Aphaca in the North of Syria, and halfway between  Byblus and Baalbec, there was a famous grove and temple of Astarte,  near which was a wild romantic gorge full of trees, the birthplace of  a certain river Adonis--the water rushing from a Cavern, under lofty  cliffs. Here (it was said) every year the youth Adonis was again wounded  to death, and the river ran red with his blood, (1) while the scarlet  anemone bloomed among the cedars and walnuts.     (1) A discoloration caused by red earth washed by rain from the  mountains, and which has been observed by modern travelers. For the  whole story of Adonis and of Attis see Frazer's Golden Bough, part iv.      The story of Attis is very similar. He was a fair young shepherd or  herdsman of Phrygia, beloved by Cybele (or Demeter), the Mother of the  gods. He was born of a Virgin--Nana--who conceived by putting a ripe  almond or pomegranate in her bosom. He died, either killed by a boar,  the symbol of winter, like Adonis, or self-castrated (like his own  priests); and he bled to death at the foot of a pine tree (the pine  and pine-cone being symbols of fertility). The sacrifice of his blood  renewed the fertility of the earth, and in the ritual celebration of  his death and resurrection his image was fastened to the trunk of a  pine-tree (compare the Crucifixion). But I shall return to this legend  presently. The worship of Attis became very widespread and much honored,  and was ultimately incorporated with the established religion at Rome  somewhere about the commencement of our Era.    The following two legends (dealing with Hercules and with Krishna) have  rather more of the character of the solar, and less of the vegetational  myth about them. Both heroes were regarded as great benefactors of  humanity; but the former more on the material plane, and the latter on  the spiritual.    Hercules or Heracles was, like other Sun-gods and benefactors of  mankind, a great Traveler. He was known in many lands, and everywhere  he was invoked as Saviour. He was miraculously conceived from a divine  Father; even in the cradle he strangled two serpents sent to destroy  him. His many labors for the good of the world were ultimately  epitomized into twelve, symbolized by the signs of the Zodiac. He slew  the Nemxan Lion and the Hydra (offspring of Typhon) and the Boar. He  overcame the Cretan Bull, and cleaned out the Stables of Augeas; he  conquered Death and, descending into Hades, brought Cerberus thence and  ascended into Heaven. On all sides he was followed by the gratitude and  the prayers of mortals.    As to Krishna, the Indian god, the points of agreement with the general  divine career indicated above are too salient to be overlooked, and too  numerous to be fully recorded. He also was born of a Virgin (Devaki)  and in a Cave, (1) and his birth announced by a Star. It was sought to  destroy him, and for that purpose a massacre of infants was ordered.  Everywhere he performed miracles, raising the dead, healing lepers, and  the deaf and the blind, and"]]]
