[Sidenote: The holiest prayer.]  There is one prayer (so called) which is esteemed pre-eminently holy;  generally called--from the meter in which it is composed--the  Gayatri.[7] It may be rendered thus:         \"Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the Divine Son (or       Vivifier); may he enlighten our understandings!\"    It has always been frequently repeated in important rites.    [Sidenote: Atharva Veda.  Inferior morally and spiritually to the Rig Veda.  Explanation of deterioration.]  So far we have referred almost exclusively to the Rig Veda. The next in  importance is the Atharva, sometimes termed the Brahma Veda; which we  may render the Veda of incantations. It contains six hundred and seventy  hymns. Of these a few are equal to those in the Rig Veda; but, as a  whole, the Atharva is far inferior to the other in a moral and spiritual  point of view. It abounds in imprecations, charms for the destruction of  enemies, and so forth. Talismans, plants, or gems are invoked, as  possessed of irresistible might to kill or heal. The deities are often  different from those of the Rig Veda. The Atharva manifests a great  dread of malignant beings, whose wrath it deprecates. We have thus  simple demon-worship. How is this great falling-off to be explained? In  one of two ways. Either a considerable time intervened between the  composition of the two books, during which the original faith had  rapidly degenerated, probably through contact with aboriginal races who  worshiped dark and sanguinary deities; or else there had existed from  the beginning two forms of the religion--the higher of which is embodied  in the hymns of the Rig Veda, and the lower in the Atharva. We believe  the latter explanation to be correct, although doubtless the  superstitions of the aborigines must all along have exerted an influence  on the faith of the invaders.    [Sidenote: The offerings.]  The offerings presented to the gods consisted chiefly of clarified  butter, curdled milk, rice-cakes, and fermented Soma juice, which was  generally mixed with water or milk. All was thrown into the fire, which  bore them or their essences to the gods. The Soma was also sprinkled on  the sacred grass, which was strewn on the floor, and on which the gods  and fathers were invited to come and seat themselves that they might  enjoy the cheering beverage. The remainder was drunk by the officiating  priests. The offerings were understood to nourish and gratify the gods  as corporeal beings.    [Sidenote: Animal victims.]  Animal victims are also offered up. We hear of sheep, goats, bulls,  cows, and buffaloes being sacrificed, and sometimes in large numbers.  But the great offering was the Asvamedha, or sacrifice of the horse. The  body of the horse was hacked to pieces; the fragments were dressed--part  was boiled, part roasted; some of the flesh was then eaten by the  persons present, and the rest was offered to the gods. Tremendous was  the potency--at least as stated in later times--of a hundred such  sacrifices; it rendered the offerer equal or superior to the gods; even  the mighty Indra trembled for his sovereignty and strove to hinder the  consummation of the awful rite.    [Sidenote: Human sacrifice.]  Human sacrifice was not unknown, though there are very few allusions to  it in the earlier hymns.    [Sidenote: Sacrifice deemed of very high importance.]  Even from the first, however, the rite of sacrifice occupies a very high  place, and allusions to it are exceedingly frequent. The observances  connected with it are said to be the \"first religious rites.\" Sacrifice  was early believed to be expiatory; it removed sin. It was  substitutionary; the victim stood in place of the offerer. All order in  the universe depends upon it; it is \"the nave of the world-wheel.\"  Sometimes Vishnu is said to be the sacrifice; sometimes even the Supreme  Being himself is so. Elaborated ideas and a complex ritual, which we  could have expected to grow up only in the course of ages, appear from  very early times. We seem compelled to draw the inference that sacrifice  formed an essential and very important part of the pre-Vedic faith.[8]    In the Veda worship is a kind of barter. In exchange for praises and  offerings the deity is asked to bestow favors. Temporal blessings are  implored, such as food, wealth, life, children, cows, horses, success in  battle, the destruction of enemies, and so forth. Not much is said  regarding sin and the need of forgiveness. A distinguished scholar[9]  has said that \"the religious notion of sin is wanting altogether;\" but  this affirmation is decidedly too sweeping.    [Sidenote: No image-worship.  No public worship.]  The worship exemplified in the Veda is not image-worship. Images of the  fire, or the winds, or the waters could hardly be required, and while  the original nature-worship lasted, idols must have been nearly unknown.  Yet the description of various deities is so precise and full that it  seems to be probably drawn from visible representations of them. Worship  was personal and domestic, not in any way public. Indeed, two men  praying at the same time had to pray quite apart, so that neither might  disturb the other. Each dealt with heaven, so to speak, solely on his  own behalf.    [Sidenote: No temples.]  We hear of no places set apart as temples in Vedic times.    [Sidenote: The treatises on ritual.]  A Veda consists of two parts called _Mantra_ or _Sanhita_, and  _Brahmana_. The first is composed of hymns. The second is a statement of  ritual, and is generally in prose. The existing Brahmanas are several  centuries later than the great body of the hymns, and were probably  composed when the Hindus had crossed the Indus, and were advancing along  the Gangetic valley. The oldest may be about the date of 800 or 700 B.C.    [Sidenote: Growth of priestly power.  Schools for the study of sacred books, rites, and  traditions.]  The Brahmanas are very poor, both in thought and expression. They have  hardly their match in any literature for \"pedantry and downright  absurdity.\"[10] Poetical feeling and even religious feeling seem gone;  all is dead and dry as dust. By this time the Sanskrit language had  ceased to be generally understood. The original texts could hardly  receive accessions; the most learned man could do little more than  interpret, or perhaps misinterpret, them. The worshiper looked on; he  worshiped now by proxy. Thus the priest had risen greatly in importance.  He alone knew the sacred verses and the sacred rites. An error in the  pronunciation of the mystic text might bring destruction on the  worshiper; what could he do but lean upon the priest? The latter could  say the prayers if he could not pray. All this worked powerfully for the  elevation of the Brahmans, the \"men of prayer;\" they steadily grew into  a class, a caste; and into this no one could enter who was not of  priestly descent. Schools were now found necessary for the study of the  sacred books, rites, and traditions. The importance which these attach  to theology--doctrine--is very small; the externals of religion are all  in all. The rites, in fact, now threw the very gods into the shade;  every thing depended on their due performance. And thus the Hindu ritual  gradually grew up into a stupendous system, the most elaborate, complex,  and burdensome which the earth has seen.    [Sidenote: Moral character of the Veda.]  It is time, however, to give a brief estimate of the moral character of  the Veda. The first thing that strikes us is its inconsistency. Some  hymns--especially those addressed to Varuna--rise as high as Gentile  conceptions regarding deity ever rose; others--even in the Rig  Veda--sink miserably low; and in the Atharva we find, \"even in the  lowest depth, a lower still.\"    [Sidenote: Indra supersedes Varuna.]  The character of Indra--who has displaced or overshadowed  Varuna[11]--has no high attributes. He is \"voracious;\" his \"inebriety is  most intense;\" he \"dances with delight in battle.\" His worshipers supply  him abundantly with the drink he loves; and he supports them against  their foes, ninety and more of whose cities he has destroyed. We do not  know that these foes, the Dasyus, were morally worse than the intrusive  Aryas, but the feelings of the latter toward the former were of  unexampled ferocity. Here is one passage out of multitudes similar:         \"Hurl thy hottest thunder-bolt upon them! Uproot them! Cleave them       asunder! O, Indra, overpower, subdue, slay the demon! Pluck him up!       Cut him through the middle! Crush his head!\"    [Sidenote: Deterioration begins early.]  Indra, if provided with Soma, is always indulgent to his votaries; he  supports them _per fas et nefas_. Varuna, on the other hand, is grave,  just, and to wicked men severe.[12] The supersession of Varuna by Indra,  then, is easily understood. We see the principle on which it rests  stated in the Old Testament. \"Ye cannot serve the Lord,\" said Joshua to  the elders of Israel; \"for he is a holy God.\" Even so Jeremiah points  sorrowfully to the fact that the pagan nations clung to their false  gods, while Israel was faithless to the true. As St. Paul expresses it,  \"they did not like to retain God in their knowledge.\" Unless this  principle is fully taken into account we cannot understand the  historical development of Hinduism.    [Sidenote: Varuna the only divinity possessed of pure and elevated  attributes.]  The Veda frequently ascribes to the gods, to use the language of Max  Mueller, \"sentiments and passions unworthy of deity.\" In truth, except in  the case of Varuna, there is not one divinity that is possessed of pure  and elevated attributes.

Doubtless the King (instigated by his  Ministers and favourites, who dreaded the exposure of all their  infamous proceedings) would have prevented this investigation, which,  he was aware, would furnish evidence of gross mal-administration,  cruelty, and oppression almost unparalleled; but Sir William Sleeman  was too well acquainted with the character of the people of the East  to be moved either by cajolery or menaces from the important duty  which had devolved upon him.    Sir William Sleeman's position as Resident enabled him to ascertain  thoroughly the real state of Oude; and the great respect with which  he was universally received manifests the high opinion entertained of  him personally by all ranks. The details he has given of the  prevailing anarchy and lawlessness throughout the kingdom, would  scarcely be believed were they not vouched for by an officer of  established reputation and integrity. Firmness united to amenity of  manner were indeed the characteristics of Sir William in his  important and delicate office at such a Court--a Court where the  King, deputing the conduct of business to Ministers influenced by the  basest motives, and who constantly sacrificed justice to bribery and  low intrigues, gave himself up to the effeminate indulgence of his  harem, and the society of eunuchs and fiddlers. His Majesty appears  to have been governed by favourites of the hour selected through  utter caprice, and to have permitted, if he did not order, such  atrocious cruelties and oppression as rendered the kingdom of Oude a  disgrace to the British rule in India, and called for strong  interference, on the score of humanity alone, as well as with the  hope of compelling amendment.    The letter addressed by Lord Dalhousie to Sir William Sleeman  expresses the desire of the Governor-General that he should endeavour  to inform himself of the actual state of Oude, and render his  Narrative a guide to the Honourable Company in its Report to the  Court of Directors. The details furnish but too faithful a picture of  the miserable condition of the people, equally oppressed by the  exactions of the King's army and collectors, and by the gangs of  robbers and lawless chieftains who infest the whole territory,  rendering tenure so doubtful that no good dwellings could be erected,  and land only partially cultivated; whilst the numberless cruelties  and atrocious murders surpass belief. Shut up in his harem, the voice  of justice seldom reached the ear of the monarch, and when it did,  was scarcely heeded. The Resident, it will be seen, was beset during  his journey with petitions for redress so numerous, that, anxious as  he was to do everything in his power to mitigate the horrors he  witnessed, he frequently gives vent to the pain he experienced at  finding relief impracticable.    The Narrative contains an unvarnished but unexaggerated picture of  the actual state of Oude, with many remedial suggestions; but direct  annexation formed no part of the policy which Sir William Sleeman  recommended. To this measure he was strenuously opposed, as is  distinctly proved by his letters appended to the Journal. At the same  time, he repeatedly affirms the total unfitness of the King to  govern. These opinions are still further corroborated by the  following letter from his private correspondence, 1854-5, written  when Resident at Lucknow, and published in the _Times_ in November  last:--    \"The system of annexation, pursued by a party in this country, and  favoured by Lord Dalhousie and his Council, has, in my opinion, and  in that of a large number of the ablest men in India, a downward  tendency--a tendency to crush all the higher and middle classes  connected with the land. These classes it should be our object to  create and foster, that we might in the end inspire them with a  feeling of interest in the stability of our rule. _We shall find a  few years hence the tables turned against us_. In fact, the  aggressive and absorbing policy, which has done so much mischief of  late in India, is beginning to create feelings of alarm in the native  mind; and it is when the popular mind becomes agitated by such alarms  that fanatics will always be found ready to step into Paradise over  the bodies of the most prominent of those from whom injury is  apprehended. I shall have nothing new to do at Lucknow. Lord  Dalhousie and I have different views, I fear. If he wishes anything  done that I do not think right and honest, I resign, and leave it to  be done by others. I desire a strict adherence to solemn engagements,  whether made with white faces or black. We have no right to annex or  confiscate Oude; but we have a right, under the treaty of 1837, to  take the management of it, but not to appropriate its revenues to  ourselves. We can do this with honour to our Government and benefit  to the people. To confiscate would be dishonest and dishonourable. To  annex would be to give the people a government almost as bad as their  own, if we put our screw upon them. My position here has been and is  disagreeable and unsatisfactory: we have a fool of a king, a knave of  a minister, and both are under the influence of one of the cleverest,  most intriguing, and most unscrupulous villains in India.\"    Major Bird, in his pamphlet \"Dacoitee in Excelsis,\" while  endeavouring to establish a case for the King of Oude, has assumed  that Sir William Sleeman was an instrument in the hands of Lord  Dalhousie, to carry out his purpose of annexing Oude to British  India. The letters, now first printed, entirely refute this hasty and  erroneous statement. Major Bird has, in fact, withdrawn it himself in  a lecture delivered by him at Southampton on Tuesday, the 16th of  February, 1858.    It will be seen that Sir W. Sleeman's \"Diary\" commences on December  1, 1849. To preserve chronological order, the letters written before  that date are prefixed; those which refer to a later period are added  at the end of the narrative.                             __________________________      PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE  PRECEDING THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE KINGDOM OF OUDE.                                          Camp, 20th February, 1848.    My Dear Sir,    I thank you for your letter of the 10th instant, and am of opinion  that you may be able to make good use of Bhurut Sing under judicious  management, and strict surveillance; but you do not mention who and  what he is--whether he is a prisoner under sentence, or a free agent,  or of what caste and profession. Some men make these offers in order  to have opportunities of escape, while engaged in the pretended  search after associates in crime; others to extort money from those  whom they may denounce, or have the authority and means to arrest. He  should be made to state distinctly the evidence he has against  persons, and the way he got it; and all should be recorded against  the names of the persons in a Register. Major Riddell is well  acquainted with our mode of proceedings in all such cases, and I  recommend you to put yourself in communication, as soon as possible,  with him, and Mr. Dampier, the Superintendent of Police, who  fortunately takes the greatest possible interest in all such matters.  I have no supervision whatever over the officers of the department  employed in Bengal; all rests entirely with Mr. Dampier. You might  write to him at once, and tell him that you are preparing such a  Register as I suggest; and if he is satisfied with the evidence, he  will authorise the arrest of all or part, and well reward Bhurut Sing  for his services.           Believe me, My Dear Sir,               With best wishes for your success,                     Yours sincerely,              (Signed)         W. H. SLEEMAN.    To Capt. J. Innes,  Barrackpoor.           _________________________                                               Camp, 20th February, 1848.  My Dear Colonel Sutherland,    There are at Jubulpore a good many of the Bagree decoits, who have  been sentenced as approvers, by the Courts of Punchaet, in  Rajpootana, to imprisonment for very short periods. Unless they are  ordered to be retained when these periods expire, on a requisition of  security for their future good behaviour, they will make off, and  assuredly return to their hereditary trade. The ordinary pay of the  grades open to them in our police and other establishments, will not  satisfy them when they find that we have no hold upon them, and they  become more and more troublesome as the time for their enlargement  approaches.    I send you copies of the letters from Government of the 27th June,  1839, from which you will see that it was intended that all  professional decoits who gave us their services on a promise of  conditional pardon, should have a sentence of imprisonment for life  recorded against them, the execution of which was to be suspended  during their good behaviour, and eventually altogether remitted in  cases where they might be deemed to have merited, by a course of true  and faithful services, such an indulgence. In all other parts, as  well as in our own provinces as in native states, such sentences,  have been recorded against these men, and they have cheerfully  submitted to them, under the assurance that they and their children  would be provided with the means of earning an honest"]]]
