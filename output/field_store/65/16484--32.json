It's wrong for women to assume men's  burdens beyond a certain point; it only makes them more selfish. If  you only knew where David is, you ought to bundle the children up and  express them to his address. Not a word of explanation or apology;  simply tie a tag on them, saying, 'Here's your Twins!'\"    \"But I love the babies,\" said Letty smiling through her tears, \"and  David may not be in a position to keep them.\"    \"Then he shouldn't have had them,\" retorted Reba promptly; \"especially  not two of them. There's such a thing as a man's being too lavish with  babies when he has no intention of doing anything for them but bring  them into the world. If you had a living income, it would be one  thing, but it makes me burn to have you stitching on coats to feed and  clothe your half-brother's children!\"    \"Perhaps it doesn't make any difference--now!\" sighed Letty, pushing  back her hair with an abstracted gesture. \"I gave up a good deal for  the darlings once, but that's past and gone. Now, after all, they're  the only life I have, and I'd rather make coats for them than for  myself.\"    Letty Boynton had never said so much as this to Mrs. Larrabee in the  three years of their friendship, and on her way back to the parsonage,  the minister's wife puzzled a little over the look in Letty's face  when she said, \"David seemed to think there could be no question of  any life of my own\"; and again, \"I gave up a good deal for the  darlings once!\"    \"Luther,\" she said to the minister, when the hymns had been chosen,  the sermon pronounced excellent, and they were toasting their toes  over the sitting-room fire,--\"Luther, do you suppose there ever was  anything between Letty Boynton and your Dick?\"    \"No,\" he answered reflectively, \"I don't think so. Dick always admired  Letty and went to the house a great deal, but I imagine that was  chiefly for David's sake, for they were as like as peas in a pod in  the matter of mischief. If there had been more than friendship between  Dick and Letty, Dick would never have gone away from Beulah, or if he  had gone, he surely would have come back to see how Letty fared. A  fellow yearns for news of the girl he loves even when he is content to  let silence reign between him and his old father.--What makes you  think there was anything particular, Reba?\"    \"What makes anybody think anything!--I wonder why some people are  born props, and others leaners or twiners? I believe the very  nursing-bottle leaned heavily against Letty when she lay on her infant  pillow. I didn't know her when she was a child, but I believe that  when she was eight all the other children of three and five in the  village looked to her for support and guidance!\"    \"It's a great vocation--that of being a prop,\" smiled the minister, as  he peeled a red Baldwin apple, carefully preserving the spiral and  eating it first.    \"I suppose the wobbly vine thinks it's grand to be a stout trellis  when it needs one to climb on, but doesn't the trellis ever want to  twine, I wonder?\" And Reba's tone was doubtful.    \"Even the trellis leans against the house, Reba.\"    \"Well, Letty never gets a chance either to lean or to twine! Her  family, her friends, her acquaintances, even the stranger within her  gates, will pass trees, barber poles, telephone and telegraph poles,  convenient corners of buildings, fence posts, ladders, and lightning  rods for the sake of winding their weakness around her strength. When  she sits down from sheer exhaustion, they come and prop themselves  against her back. If she goes to bed, they climb up on the footboard,  hang a drooping head, and look her wistfully in the eye for sympathy.  Prop on, prop ever, seems to be the underlying law of the universe!\"    \"Poor Reba! She is talking of Letty and thinking of herself!\" And the  minister's eye twinkled.    \"Well, a little!\" admitted his wife; \"but I'm only a village prop, not  a family one. Where you are concerned\"--and she administered an  affectionate pat to his cheek as she rose from her chair--\"I'm a  trellis that leans against a rock!\"          [Illustration]    III      Letitia Boynton's life had been rather a drab one as seen through  other people's eyes, but it had never seemed so to her till within the  last few years. Her own father had been the village doctor, but of him  she had no memory. Her mother's second marriage to a venerable country  lawyer, John Gilman, had brought a kindly, inefficient stepfather into  the family, a man who speedily became an invalid needing constant  nursing. The birth of David when Letty was three years old, brought a  new interest into the household, and the two children grew to be fast  friends; but when Mrs. Gilman died, and Letty found herself at  eighteen the mistress of the house, the nurse of her aged stepfather,  and the only guardian of a boy of fifteen, life became difficult. More  difficult still it became when the old lawyer died, for he at least  had been a sort of fictitious head of the family and his mere  existence kept David within bounds.    David was a lively, harum-scarum, handsome youth, good at his lessons,  popular with his companions, always in a scrape, into which he was  generally drawn by the minister's son, so the neighbors thought. At  any rate, Dick Larrabee, as David's senior, received the lion's share  of the blame when mischief was abroad. If Parson Larrabee's boy  couldn't behave any better than an unbelieving black-smith's, a  Methodist farmer's, or a Baptist storekeeper's, what was the use of  claiming superior efficacy for the Congregational form of belief?    \"Dick's father's never succeeded in bringing him into the church,  though he's worked on him from the time he was knee-high to a toad,\"  said Mrs. Popham.    \"P'raps his mother kind o' vaccinated him with religion 'stid o'  leavin' him to take it the natural way, as the ol' sayin' is,\" was her  husband's response. \"The first Mis' Larrabee was as good as gold, but  she may have overdone the trick a little mite, mebbe; and what's more,  I kind o' suspicion the parson thinks so himself. He ain't never been  quite the same sence Dick left home, 'cept in preaching'; an' I tell  you, Maria, his high-water mark there is higher 'n ever. Abel Dunn o'  Boston walked home from meetin' with me Thanksgivin', an', says he,  takin' off his hat an' moppin' his forehead, 'Osh,' says he, 'does  your minister preach like that every Sunday?' 'No,' says I, 'he don't.  If he did we couldn't stan' it! He preaches like that about once a  month, an' we don't care what he says the rest o' the time.'\"    \"Well, so far as boys are concerned, preachin' ain't so reliable, for  behavin' purposes, as a good young alder switch,\" was the opinion of  Mrs. Popham, her children being of the comatose kind, whose minds had  never been illuminated by the dazzling idea of disobedience.    \"Land sakes, Maria! There ain't alders enough on the river-bank to  switch religion into a boy like Dick Larrabee. It's got to come like  a thief in the night, as the ol' sayin' is, but I guess I don't mean  thief, I guess I mean star: it's got to come kind o' like a star in a  dark night. If the whole village, 'generate an' onregenerate, hadn't  'a' kep' on naggin' an' hectorin' an' criticizin' them two boys, Dick  an' Dave,--carryin' tales an' multiplyin' of 'em by two, '_ong root_'  as the ol' sayin' is,--I dare say they'd 'a' both been here yet; 'stid  o' roamin' roun' the earth seekin' whom they may devour.\"    There was considerable truth in Ossian Popham's remark, as Letty could  have testified; for the conduct of the Boynton-Gilman household, as  well as that of the minister, had been continually under inspection  and discussion.    Nothing could remain long hidden in Beulah. Nobody spied, nobody  pried, nobody listened at doors or windows, nobody owned a microscope,  nobody took any particular notice of events, or if they did they  preserved an attitude of profound indifference while doing it,--yet  everything was known sooner or later. The amount of the fish and meat  bill, the precise extent of credit, the number of letters in the post,  the amount of fuel burned, the number of absences from church and  prayer-meeting, the calls or visits made and received, the hours of  arrival or departure, the source of all incomes,--these details were  the common property of the village. It even took cognizance of more  subtle things; for it observed and recorded the fluctuations of all  love affairs, and the fluctuations also in the religious experiences  of various persons not always in spiritual equilibrium; for the soul  was an object of scrutiny in Beulah, as well as mind, body, and  estate.    Letty Boynton used to feel that nothing was exclusively her own; that  she belonged to Beulah part and parcel; but Dick Larrabee was far more  restive under the village espionage than were she and David.    It was natural that David should want to leave Beulah and make his way  in the world, and his sister did not oppose it. Dick's circumstances  were different. He had inherited a small house and farm from his  mother, had enjoyed a college education, and had been offered a share  in a good business in a city twelve miles away. He left Beulah because  he hated it. He left because he could not endure his father's gentle  remonstrances or the bewilderment in his stepmother's eyes. She was a  newcomer in the household and her glance seemed to say: \"Why on earth  do you behave so badly to your father when you're such a delightful  chap?\" He left because Deacon Todd had prayed for him publicly at a  Christian Endeavor meeting; because Mrs. Popham had circulated a  wholly baseless scandal about him; and finally because in his young"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#3)"],[1,"comedies, operas, oratorios, puppet-shows, and academic  disputes. Under the auspices of this patron, Handel composed three  operas and two oratorios. Even at this early period the young composer  was parting company with the strict old musical traditions, and his  works showed an extraordinary variety and strength of treatment.    From Rome he went to Naples, where he spent his second Italian summer,  and composed the original Italian \"Aci e Galatea,\" which in its English  version, afterward written for the Duke of Chandos, has continued a  marked favorite with the musical world. Thence, after a lingering return  through the sunny land where he had been so warmly welcomed, and which  had taught him most effectually, in convincing him that his musical life  had nothing in common with the traditions of Italian musical art, he  returned to Germany, settling at the court of George of Brunswick,  Elector of Hanover, and afterward King of England. He received  commission in the course of a few months from the elector to visit  England, having been warmly invited thither by some English noblemen. On  his return to Hanover, at the end of six months, he found the dull and  pompous little court unspeakably tiresome after the bustle of London.  So it is not to be marveled at that he took the earliest opportunity of  returning to the land which he afterward adopted. At this period he was  not yet twenty-five years old, but already famous as a performer on the  organ and harpsichord, and as a composer of Italian operas.    When Queen Anne died and Handel's old patron became King of England,  Handel was forbidden to appear before him, as he had not forgotten the  musician's escapade; but his peace was at last made by a little ruse.  Handel had a friend at court, Baron Kilmansegge, from whom he learned  that the king was, on a certain day, going to take an excursion on the  Thames. So he set to work to compose music for the occasion, which he  arranged to have performed on a boat which followed the king's barge.  As the king floated down the river he heard the new and delightful  \"Water-Music.\" He knew that only one man could have composed such music;  so he sent for Handel, and sealed his pardon with a pension of two  hundred pounds a year.      II.    Let us take a glance at the society in which the composer moved in the  heyday of his youth. His greatness was to be perfected in after-years  by bitter rivalries, persecution, alternate oscillations of poverty  and affluence, and a multitude of bitter experiences. But at this time  Handel's life was a serene and delightful one. Rival factions had not  been organized to crush him. Lord Burlington lived much at his mansion,  which was then out of town, although the house is now in the heart of  Piccadilly. The intimate friendship of this nobleman helped to bring the  young musician into contact with many distinguished people.    It is odd to think of the people Handel met daily without knowing that  their names and his would be in a century famous. The following picture  sketches Handel and his friends in a sprightly fashion:    \"Yonder heavy, ragged-looking youth standing at the corner of Regent  Street, with a slight and rather more refined-looking companion, is  the obscure Samuel Johnson, quite unknown to fame. He is walking with  Richard Savage. As Signor Handel, 'the composer of Italian music,'  passes by, Savage becomes excited, and nudges his friend, who takes only  a languid interest in the foreigner. Johnson did not care for music; of  many noises he considered it the least disagreeable.    \"Toward Charing Cross comes, in shovel-hat and cassock, the renowned  ecclesiastic Dean Swift. He has just nodded patronizingly to Bononcini  in the Strand, and suddenly meets Handel, who cuts him dead. Nothing  disconcerted, the dean moves on, muttering his famous epigram:         'Some say that Signor Bononcini,       Compared to Handel, is a ninny;       While others vow that to him Handel       Is hardly fit to hold a candle.       Strange that such difference should be       'Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.'    \"As Handel enters the 'Turk's Head' at the corner of Regent Street,  a noble coach and four drives up. It is the Duke of Chandos, who is  inquiring for Mr. Pope. Presently a deformed little man, in an iron-gray  suit, and with a face as keen as a razor, hobbles out, makes a low bow  to the burly Handel, who, helping him into the chariot, gets in after  him, and they drive off together to Cannons, the duke's mansion at  Edge-ware. There they meet Mr. Addison, the poet Gay, and the witty  Arbuthnot, who have been asked to luncheon. The last number of the  _Spectator_ is on the table, and a brisk discussion soon arises between  Pope and Addison concerning the merits of the Italian opera, in which  Pope would have the better if he only knew a little more about music,  and could keep his temper. Arbuthnot sides with Pope in favor of Mr.  Handel's operas; the duke endeavors to keep the peace. Handel probably  uses his favorite exclamation, 'Vat te tevil I care!' and consumes the  _recherche_ wines and rare viands with undiminished gusto.    \"The Magnificent, or the Grand Duke, as he was called, had built himself  a palace for L230,000. He had a private chapel, and appointed Handel  organist in the room of the celebrated Dr. Pepusch, who retired with  excellent grace before one manifestly his superior. On week-days the  duke and duchess entertained all the wits and grandees in town, and on  Sundays the Edgeware Road was thronged with the gay equipages of those  who went to worship at the ducal chapel and hear Mr. Handel play on the  organ.    \"The Edgeware Road was a pleasant country drive, but parts of it were  so solitary that highwaymen were much to be feared. The duke was himself  attacked on one occasion; and those who could afford it never traveled  so far out of town without armed retainers. Cannons was the pride of the  neighborhood, and the duke--of whom Pope wrote,         'Thus gracious Chandos is beloved at sight'--    was as popular as he was wealthy. But his name is made still more  illustrious by the Chandos anthems. They were all written at Cannons  between 1718 and 1720, and number in all eleven overtures, thirty-two  solos, six duets, a trio, quartet, and forty-seven choruses. Some of the  above are real masterpieces; but, with the exception of 'The waves of  the sea rage horribly,' and 'Who is God but the Lord?' few of them  are ever heard now. And yet these anthems were most significant in the  variety of the choruses and in the range of the accompaniments; and it  was then, no doubt, that Handel was feeling his way toward the great  and immortal sphere of his oratorio music. Indeed, his first oratorio,  'Esther,' was composed at Cannons, as also the English version of 'Acis  and Galatea.'\"    But Handel had other associates, and we must now visit Thomas Britton,  the musical coal-heaver. \"There goes the famous small-coal man, a lover  of learning, a musician, and a companion of gentlemen.\" So the folks  used to say as Thomas Britton, the coal-heaver of Clerkenwell Green,  paced up and down the neighboring streets with his sack of small coal on  his back, destined for one of his customers. Britton was great among the  great. He was courted by the most fashionable folk of his day. He was  a cultivated coal-heaver, who, besides his musical taste and ability,  possessed an extensive knowledge of chemistry and the occult sciences.    Britton did more than this. He gave concerts in Aylesbury Street,  Clerkenwell, where this singular man had formed a dwelling-house, with  a concert-room and a coal-store, out of what was originally a stable.  On the ground-floor was the small-coal repository, and over that the  concert-room--very long and narrow, badly lighted, and with a ceiling  so low that a tall man could scarcely stand upright in it. The stairs to  this room were far from pleasant to ascend, and the following facetious  lines by Ward, the author of the \"London Spy,\" confirm this:         \"Upon Thursdays repair       To my palace, and there       Hobble up stair by stair       But I pray ye take care       That you break not your shins by a stumble;         \"And without e'er a souse       Paid to me or my spouse,       Sit as still as a mouse       At the top of the house,       And there you shall hear how we fumble.\"    Nevertheless beautiful duchesses and the best society in town flocked  to Britton's on Thursdays--not to order coals, but to sit out his  concerts.    Let us follow the short, stout little man on a concert-day. The  customers are all served, or as many as can be. The coal-shed is made  tidy and swept up, and the coal-heaver awaits his company. There he  stands at the door of his stable, dressed in his blue blouse,  dustman's hat, and maroon kerchief tightly fastened round his neck. The  concert-room is almost full, and, pipe in hand, Britton awaits a new  visitor--the beautiful Duchess of B------. She is somewhat late (the  coachman, possibly, is not quite at home in the neighborhood).    Here comes a carriage, which stops at the coal-shop; and, laying down  his pipe, the coal-heaver assists her grace to alight, and in the  genteelest manner escorts her to the narrow staircase leading to  the music-room. Forgetting Ward's advice, she trips laughingly and  carelessly up the stairs to the room, from which proceed faint sounds of  music, increasing to quite an _olla podri-da_ of sound as the apartment  is reached--for the musicians are tuning up. The beautiful duchess is  soon recognized, and as soon in deep gossip with her friends. But who is  that gentlemanly man leaning over the chamber-organ? That is Sir Roger  L'Estrange, an admirable performer on the violoncello, and a great lover  of music. He is watching the subtile fingering of Mr. Handel, as his  dimpled hands drift leisurely and marvelously over the keys of the  instrument."]]]
