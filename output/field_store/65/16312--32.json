If, now and then, there was an inevitable  alternative of meaning or music, I gave the preference to the former. By  the term \"original metres\" I do not mean a rigid, unyielding adherence  to every foot, line, and rhyme of the German original, although this has  very nearly been accomplished. Since the greater part of the work is  written in an irregular measure, the lines varying from three to six  feet, and the rhymes arranged according to the author's will, I do not  consider that an occasional change in the number of feet, or order of  rhyme, is any violation of the metrical plan. The single slight liberty  I have taken with the lyrical passages is in Margaret's song,--\"The King  of Thule,\"--in which, by omitting the alternate feminine rhymes, yet  retaining the metre, I was enabled to make the translation strictly  literal. If, in two or three instances, I have left a line unrhymed, I  have balanced the omission by giving rhymes to other lines which stand  unrhymed in the original text. For the same reason, I make no apology  for the imperfect rhymes, which are frequently a translation as well as  a necessity. With all its supreme qualities, _Faust_ is far from being a  technically perfect work.[K]    [K] \"At present, everything runs in technical grooves, and the critical  gentlemen begin to wrangle whether in a rhyme an _s_ should correspond  with an _s_ and not with _sz_. If I were young and reckless enough, I  would purposely offend all such technical caprices: I would use  alliteration, assonance, false rhyme, just according to my own will or  convenience--but, at the same time, I would attend to the main thing,  and endeavor to say so many good things that every one would be  attracted to read and remember them.\"--_Goethe_, in 1831.    The feminine and dactylic rhymes, which have been for the most part  omitted by all metrical translators except Mr. Brooks, are  indispensable. The characteristic tone of many passages would be nearly  lost, without them. They give spirit and grace to the dialogue, point to  the aphoristic portions (especially in the Second Part), and an  ever-changing music to the lyrical passages. The English language,  though not so rich as the German in such rhymes, is less deficient than  is generally supposed. The difficulty to be overcome is one of  construction rather than of the vocabulary. The present participle can  only be used to a limited extent, on account of its weak termination,  and the want of an accusative form to the noun also restricts the  arrangement of words in English verse. I cannot hope to have been always  successful; but I have at least labored long and patiently, bearing  constantly in mind not only the meaning of the original and the  mechanical structure of the lines, but also that subtile and haunting  music which seems to govern rhythm instead of being governed by it.

I find ye,  As early to my clouded sight ye shone!  Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye?  Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown?  Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye,  And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone!  My bosom thrills, with youthful passion shaken,  From magic airs that round your march awaken.    Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision;  The dear, familiar phantoms rise again,  And, like an old and half-extinct tradition,  First Love returns, with Friendship in his train.  Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition  Life tracks his devious, labyrinthine chain,  And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them  From happy hours, and left me to deplore them.    They hear no longer these succeeding measures,  The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang:    Dispersed the friendly troop, with all its pleasures,  And still, alas! the echoes first that rang!  I bring the unknown multitude my treasures;  Their very plaudits give my heart a pang,  And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered,  If still they live, wide through the world are scattered.    And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning  For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land:  My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning,  Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned.  I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning,  And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned.  What I possess, I see far distant lying,  And what I lost, grows real and undying.

Come, let me know your expectation  Of this, our enterprise, in German land!  I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated,  Especially since it lives and lets me live;  The posts are set, the booth of boards completed.  And each awaits the banquet I shall give.  Already there, with curious eyebrows raised,  They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed.  I know how one the People's taste may flatter,  Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel:  What they're accustomed to, is no great matter,  But then, alas! they've read an awful deal.  How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,--  Important matter, yet attractive too?  For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging,  When to our booth the current sets apace,  And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging,  Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace:  By daylight even, they push and cram in  To reach the seller's box, a fighting host,  And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine,  To get a ticket break their necks almost.  This miracle alone can work the Poet  On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it.      POET      Speak not to me of yonder motley masses,  Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song!  Hide from my view the surging crowd that passes,  And in its whirlpool forces us along!  No, lead me where some heavenly silence glasses  The purer joys that round the Poet throng,--  Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion  The bonds that bless, the wreaths that crown his passion!  Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling  The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,--  Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,--  Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast;  Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing,  Its perfect stature stands at last confessed!  What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit:  What's genuine, shall Posterity inherit.      MERRY-ANDREW      Posterity! Don't name the word to me!  If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity,  Where would you get contemporary fun?  That men _will_ have it, there's no blinking:  A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking,  Is something worth, to every one.  Who genially his nature can outpour,  Takes from the People's moods no irritation;  The wider circle he acquires, the more  Securely works his inspiration.  Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin!  Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,--  Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,--  But have a care, lest Folly be omitted!    MANAGER    Chiefly, enough of incident prepare!  They come to look, and they prefer to stare.  Reel off a host of threads before their faces,  So that they gape in stupid wonder: then  By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces,  And are, at once, most popular of men.  Only by mass you touch the mass; for any  Will finally, himself, his bit select:  Who offers much, brings something unto many,  And each goes home content with the effect,  If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it:  A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it!  'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent.  What use, a Whole compactly to present?  Your hearers pick and pluck, as soon as they receive it!    POET    You do not feel, how such a trade debases;  How ill it suits the Artist, proud and true!  The botching work each fine pretender traces  Is, I perceive, a principle with you.    MANAGER    Such a reproach not in the least offends;  A man who some result intends  Must use the tools that best are fitting.  Reflect, soft wood is given to you for splitting,  And then, observe for whom you write!  If one comes bored, exhausted quite,  Another, satiate, leaves the banquet's tapers,  And, worst of all, full many a wight  Is fresh from reading of the daily papers.  Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade,  Mere curiosity their spirits warming:  The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid,  Without a salary their parts performing.  What dreams are yours in high poetic places?  You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold?  Draw near, and view your patrons' faces!  The half are coarse, the half are cold.

By that time every pupil--from Lavinia  Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to Lottie  Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school--had heard a  great deal about her.  They knew very certainly that she was Miss  Minchin's show pupil and was considered a credit to the establishment.  One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her French maid,  Mariette, who had arrived the evening before. Lavinia had managed to  pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen Mariette opening  a box which had arrived late from some shop.    \"It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them--frills and  frills,\" she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her  geography. \"I saw her shaking them out.  I heard Miss Minchin say to  Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous  for a child.  My mamma says that children should be dressed simply. She  has got one of those petticoats on now.  I saw it when she sat down.\"    \"She has silk stockings on!\" whispered Jessie, bending over her  geography also.  \"And what little feet!  I never saw such little feet.\"    \"Oh,\" sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, \"that is the way her slippers are  made.  My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if  you have a clever shoemaker.  I don't think she is pretty at all. Her  eyes are such a queer color.\"    \"She isn't pretty as other pretty people are,\" said Jessie, stealing a  glance across the room; \"but she makes you want to look at her again.  She has tremendously long eyelashes, but her eyes are almost green.\"    Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, waiting to be told what to do.  She had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk.  She was not abashed at  all by the many pairs of eyes watching her.  She was interested and  looked back quietly at the children who looked at her. She wondered  what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they  cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her  own.  She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.    \"He is on the sea now, Emily,\" she had said.  \"We must be very great  friends to each other and tell each other things.  Emily, look at me.  You have the nicest eyes I ever saw--but I wish you could speak.\"    She was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one of  her fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even  pretending that Emily was alive and really heard and understood. After  Mariette had dressed her in her dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her  hair with a dark-blue ribbon, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of  her own, and gave her a book.    \"You can read that while I am downstairs,\" she said; and, seeing  Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious  little face.    \"What I believe about dolls,\" she said, \"is that they can do things  they will not let us know about.  Perhaps, really, Emily can read and  talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room.  That is her secret.  You see, if people knew that dolls could do  things, they would make them work.  So, perhaps, they have promised  each other to keep it a secret.  If you stay in the room, Emily will  just sit there and stare; but if you go out, she will begin to read,  perhaps, or go and look out of the window. Then if she heard either of  us coming, she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend  she had been there all the time.\"    \"Comme elle est drole!\"  Mariette said to herself, and when she went  downstairs she told the head housemaid about it.  But she had already  begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small  face and such perfect manners.  She had taken care of children before  who were not so polite.  Sara was a very fine little person, and had a  gentle, appreciative way of saying, \"If you please, Mariette,\" \"Thank  you, Mariette,\" which was very charming.  Mariette told the head  housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady.    \"Elle a l'air d'une princesse, cette petite,\" she said. Indeed, she was  very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place  greatly.    After Sara had sat in her seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes,  being looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin rapped in a dignified  manner upon her desk.    \"Young ladies,\" she said, \"I wish to introduce you to your new  companion.\"  All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose  also.  \"I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe; she  has just come to us from a great distance--in fact, from India. As soon  as lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance.\"    The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and Sara made a little curtsy, and then  they sat down and looked at each other again.    \"Sara,\" said Miss Minchin in her schoolroom manner, \"come here to me.\"    She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves.  Sara went to her politely.    \"As your papa has engaged a French maid for you,\" she began, \"I  conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the French  language.\"    Sara felt a little awkward.    \"I think he engaged her,\" she said, \"because he--he thought I would  like her, Miss Minchin.\"    \"I am afraid,\" said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, \"that you  have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are  done because you like them.  My impression is that your papa wished you  to learn French.\"    If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to  people, she could have explained herself in a very few words. But, as  it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks.  Miss Minchin was a very  severe and imposing person, and she seemed so absolutely sure that Sara  knew nothing whatever of French that she felt as if it would be almost  rude to correct her.  The truth was that Sara could not remember the  time when she had not seemed to know French. Her father had often  spoken it to her when she had been a baby. Her mother had been a French  woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language, so it happened that  Sara had always heard and been familiar with it.    \"I--I have never really learned French, but--but--\" she began, trying  shyly to make herself clear.    One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she did not  speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating  fact. She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and  laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.    \"That is enough,\" she said with polite tartness.  \"If you have not  learned, you must begin at once.  The French master, Monsieur Dufarge,  will be here in a few minutes.  Take this book and look at it until he  arrives.\"    Sara's cheeks felt warm.  She went back to her seat and opened the  book. She looked at the first page with a grave face.  She knew it  would be rude to smile, and she was very determined not to be rude. But  it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her  that \"le pere\" meant \"the father,\" and \"la mere\" meant \"the mother.\"    Miss Minchin glanced toward her scrutinizingly.    \"You look rather cross, Sara,\" she said.  \"I am sorry you do not like  the idea of learning French.\"    \"I am very fond of it,\" answered Sara, thinking she would try again;  \"but--\"    \"You must not say 'but' when you are told to do things,\" said Miss  Minchin.  \"Look at your book again.\"    And Sara did so, and did not smile, even when she found that \"le fils\"  meant \"the son,\" and \"le frere\" meant \"the brother.\"    \"When Monsieur Dufarge comes,\" she thought, \"I can make him understand.\"    Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly afterward.  He was a very nice,  intelligent, middle-aged Frenchman, and he looked interested when his  eyes fell upon Sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her little book  of phrases.    \"Is this a new pupil for me, madame?\" he said to Miss Minchin.  \"I hope  that is my good fortune.\"    \"Her papa--Captain Crewe--is very anxious that she should begin the  language.  But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it. She  does not seem to wish to learn,\" said Miss Minchin.    \"I am sorry of that, mademoiselle,\" he said kindly to Sara.  \"Perhaps,  when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a charming  tongue.\"    Little Sara rose in her seat.  She was beginning to feel rather  desperate, as if she were almost in disgrace.  She looked up into  Monsieur Dufarge's face with her big, green-gray eyes, and they were  quite innocently appealing.  She knew that he would understand as soon  as she spoke.  She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent  French.  Madame had not understood.  She had not learned French  exactly--not out of books--but her papa and other people had always  spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read  and written English. Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he  did.  Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French.  She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what  she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words  in this book--and she held out the little book of phrases.    When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat  staring at her over her eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she had  finished.  Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of  great pleasure.  To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own  language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in  his native land--which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed  worlds away.  When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her,  with a look almost affectionate. But he spoke to Miss Minchin.    \"Ah, madame,\" he said, \"there is not much I can teach her.  She has not  LEARNED French; she is French.  Her accent is"]]]
