[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],[0,"The Children's Six Minutes (#3)"],[1," snow is packed into those ravines  all through the year, and lifting the eyes one may see upon the lofty  mountain side the Holy Cross.    In the summer seas, one of the things that mariners are guided by and  that tourists look for, is the Southern Cross. There it is, fashioned by  the position of the stars in the clear skies of the tropics.    There are many men who wear a cross as a watch fob. There are women who  wear a cross as a pendant about the neck. This is an outward sign of an  inner devotion. The important thing, my dear young Christians, is to  have the cross, its power and meaning, stamped upon one's heart. Is that  where you wear the Saviour's cross?    MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 1: 18        \"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish      foolishness; but unto them which are saved it is the power of      God.\"    MEMORY HYMN [143]        _\"In the cross of Christ I glory.\"_          EASTER LIGHT      This glad morning, when the world is so bright and beautiful, I want to  talk to you about Easter Light.    One of the most interesting men in our city is a man who goes about our  streets with two long sticks. He is the lamplighter. Here he comes down  the street! See how he pauses at each lamp post. With one stick he pulls  the little chain that turns on the gas; with the other he sets the light  going. He walks into the dark, but he leaves behind him miles of lighted  streets. I hope we shall have always many streets lighted with gas, for  I love to see the lamplighter dot his way along the streets and avenues  with lighted periods.    In the center of our city is the tall Electric Light Building. On the  very tip of the tower is a high power electric light. It is lighted  every evening from eight to eleven o'clock. Children, looking out of  their windows as they go to bed, think that it is another star in the  sky, it is so bright and steady.    More wonderful than any of these lights is the source of all light. It  is the light that God provides for all of his children. The sun warms  our fields, makes our gardens grow, and causes our harvests to prosper.  The sun never fails us.    Now there is another light, a light that is above even the sun. That is  the light of Easter day. The tomb of death is no longer dark, for the  resurrection light brightens every corner and shines in radiance through  the open doorway. The light of Easter also lights up the windows of our  heavenly home. When you are out of an evening it is not pleasant to  return to a dark house. There is a wondrous welcome in lighted windows.  That welcome God gives us in the light of Easter day. Christ, and his  resurrection, shine in the windows of heaven to greet us when we go  home.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 28: 1        \"In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first      day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the      sepulchre.\"    MEMORY HYMN [156]        _\"Christ the Lord is risen to-day.\"_          APRIL      I have in my hand a small branch from a big tree. This branch is from an  apple tree. Here are seen the tiny buds, the promise of the blossom, and  after that the fruit. Have you ever seen an apple orchard in blossom?  People rave about the cherry blossoms of Japan, and the fire trees,  flaming red, of the Philippines. I have been in both countries, but I  think there is no more beautiful sight in any country than the  blossoming apple orchards of America.    As you came to church this morning you saw all along the streets and  avenues hundreds of trees like this branch, sending forth their first  buds. What do these buds tell us?    First of all they tell us of God. I do not see how any one can live  through the awakening spring season and not think daily thoughts of God.  Most people remember the Creator. Only one person has ever denied God.  \"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.\" He said it to  himself, he did not dare speak it out loud.    In the second place, this branch tells us of God's Love. He, the loving  Father of all people, makes blessed provision for the care and nurture  of his children. He reminds us each year, in seedtime and harvest, of  his boundless love. His love never fails. There have been many hundreds  of years in the history of the world, yet each year has had its spring,  its seedtime, and its Resurrection. Young people, let God's April speak  to you.        \"When I am gone, somehow I hope that April      Will typify my life, my faith,      My hope of victory through the years,      My steadiness of step, my clear and visioned eye.      The early flowers, the birds      Singing in the rain,      The increasing light, the slowly opening buds,      The almond blooms, the trees in vernal dress      Are like the silver crown upon the head;      A prophecy of heaven's summer time.      Yes, even now it is the April      Of my great immortality.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 11: 25        \"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life.\"    MEMORY HYMN [389]        _\"Sow in the morn thy seed.\"_          HELPING FINGERS      For three years I lived in Manila, Philippine Islands. Not far from my  home was an orphanage for children who were deaf and dumb. Frequently  these children were seen at different entertainments that were given  about the city. One evening I went to attend a lecture in the Y.M.C.A.  Right in front of me sat three children. They were very quiet and  orderly. When the lecture began the boy who sat in the middle began to  make his fingers go as fast as he could, the two children on either side  watching him intently. That center boy could hear, the other two were  deaf. So he heard the lecture for them and told it to them by the finger  language.    One day a girl, coming out from school, got on a street car to go to her  home. The car was crowded. She found a seat next to a woman who was  heavily laden with bundles. She had all she could do to hold those  bundles in her lap and keep them from falling and scattering their  contents on the floor. Then a string about one of the packages became  untied. She struggled to get that string fastened securely. She had so  many packages, her fingers were numb with cold, and again and again the  string slipped just at the crucial time. Finally this school girl, who  was an attractive, well-dressed girl, reached over and placed her nicely  gloved finger on the obstreperous knot. There was a grateful smile from  the troubled woman and a hearty \"Thank you.\" The next stop was the  girl's home. As she went to the end of the car she passed a school  friend who had watched the little incident. She said to her, \"I see you  belong to the helping hand society.\" \"No,\" replied the girl, \"not the  helping hand, just the helping finger society.\" This is a great society,  girls and boys. Admission to it requires no initiation fee, no dues,  simply the desire and the will to be helpful wherever you are.    MEMORY VERSE, _Ecclesiastes_ 9: 10        \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\"    MEMORY HYMN [349]        _\"Saviour, thy dying love thou gavest me.\"_          TWO R'S AND AN A      Do you know what week this is? We have all sorts of weeks, don't we!  There is Sunday School week, Go to Church week, Boy Scout week, Red  Cross week, Social Welfare week, Hospital week, Y.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A.  week. Sometimes we wish we could have one week all to ourselves.    Well, this is a special week. It is called Good Literature week. I want  to tell you about Good Literature week by the use of these three  letters, two R's and an A.    The first R stands for Read. By all means read. There is no excuse for  not reading, there is so much to read. Indeed I think that is the chief  difficulty, we have too much, at least too much of that which is not  good to read. Here's the bulky daily paper. When it is delivered there  is a rush for it. The children want the comic supplement. So do some of  the grownups.        \"A little nonsense now and then,      Is relished by the wisest men.\"    That is true, and all right, but read something beside the comics.    The second R is Remember. You cannot remember all that you read. You can  remember much. You should train your mind to remember the best. John  Ruskin, one of the most gifted of Englishmen, said, \"To this I owe all  that I have of power, to the fact that when I was a boy my mother made  me learn, every day, and remember, a verse of the Bible.\"    Now the A. The A stands for, can you guess? It means Action. Read,  remember what you read, and then apply it, put it into action. It is a  fine thing to read a story like Pollyanna and get all excited over it.  It is much finer to read Pollyanna and then put her spirit into action  in the daily life of the home.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 11        \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might; not sin against      thee.\"    MEMORY HYMN [201]        _\"How precious is the book divine!\"_          CANDLE CHILDREN      What is this I have here? It is a candle in a candlestick. There is  something about a candle we all love. We have our clear gas lights and  our still more brilliant electric bulbs, but when the birthday comes we  want a cake with candles on it. Think of this as a birthday candle and  let it speak to you.    First of all this candle speaks of Symmetry. How perfectly formed is  this candle! It is smooth, there are no rough places that stand out like  an ugly wart on one's face. Your life should have symmetry. God asks you  to give heed to your physical, your mental and your spiritual duties  that your life may be well rounded, a life of beautiful symmetry.    Second, this candle stands for Fragrance. This is a fragrant candle. It  is what is known as a \"barberry\" candle. There are some children we do  not like to have around, they are surly, sulky and mean. There are  others we dear love to have with us at all times. They have what I call  fragrance. They have the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#3)"],[1," may be told,  And healer be to this aching thought,  Which one time hovereth, evil-cold,  And then from the fires thou kindlest  Will Hope be kindled, and hungry Care  Fall back for a little while, nor tear  The heart that beateth below my breast.      [CLYTEMNESTRA _rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence,  and goes into the House. The_ CHORUS _take position and begin their first  Stasimon, or Standing-song,_    CHORUS.    (_The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young_.)    It is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given,      To men more strong,  (For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven      A spell, a Strength of Song:)  How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided      Above all Greeks that are,  With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided      By the Bird of War.  'Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,      One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,  By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;  And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,  Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.      _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_!    (_How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future_.)    And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke      Twain-tempered, knew  Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,      Reading the omen true.  \"At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,        Yea, and before the wall  Violent division the fulness of land and town        Shall waste withal;  If only God's eye gloom not against our gates,    And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.  For Pity lives, and those winged Hounds she hates,    Which tore in the Trembler's body the unborn beast.  And Artemis abhorreth the eagles' feast.\"      _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_!     (_He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his  vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her  back_.)       \"Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover        Of the dewy breath of the Lion's child;      Thou the delight, through den and cover,        Of the young life at the breast of the wild,  Yet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles' Kill!  Be the vision accepted, albeit horrible....  But I-e, I-e! Stay her, O Paian, stay!  For lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,    Long wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,  On, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:  They kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;  Strife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,  And beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken--  It plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth--        Wrath for a child to be.\"  So Calchas, reading the wayside eagles' sign,    Spake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;        And like his song be thine,  _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_!    (_Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace.  I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering_.)    Zeus! Zeus, whate'er He be,  If this name He love to hear  This He shall be called of me.  Searching earth and sea and air    Refuge nowhere can I find  Save Him only, if my mind  Will cast off before it die  The burden of this vanity.    One there was who reigned of old,  Big with wrath to brave and blast,  Lo, his name is no more told!  And who followed met at last  His Third-thrower, and is gone.  Only they whose hearts have known  Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,  They shall win their vision's end;    Zeus the Guide, who made man turn  Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain  Man by Suffering shall Learn.  So the heart of him, again  Aching with remembered pain,  Bleeds and sleepeth not, until  Wisdom comes against his will.  'Tis the gift of One by strife  Lifted to the throne of life.    (AGAMEMNON _accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the  fleet lay at Aulis._)    So that day the Elder Lord,  Marshal of the Achaian ships,  Strove not with the prophet's word,  Bowed him to his fate's eclipse,  When with empty jars and lips  Parched and seas impassable  Fate on that Greek army fell,  Fronting Chalcis as it lay,  By Aulis in the swirling bay.    (_Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the  death of_ AGAMEMNON'S _daughter. The King's doubt and grief_.)    And winds, winds blew from Strymon River,  Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,  Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,    And the waste of days was made long, more long,  Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;    Then through the storm rose the War-seer's song,  And told of medicine that should tame the tempest,    But bow the Princes to a direr wrong.  Then \"Artemis\" he whispered, he named the name;  And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,  And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.    But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:  \"A heavy doom, sure, if God's will were broken;  But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,    Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow  On her father's hand, hard beside an altar?    My path is sorrow wheresoe'er I go.  Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,    And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?  They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,  For a Virgin's blood: 'tis a rite of old, men tell.  And they burn with longing.--O God may the end be well!\"    (_But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his  daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice._)    To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,    And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,  A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;    And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.  For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying    Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,      Yea, and itself is grief;  So this man hardened to his own child's slaying,    As help to avenge him for a woman's laughter      And bring his ships relief!    Her \"Father, Father,\" her sad cry that lingered,    Her virgin heart's breath they held all as naught,  Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;    And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought  He charged the young men to uplift and bind her,    As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,      Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore  To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder    The sweet mouth's utterance, the cries that falter,      --His curse for evermore!--    With violence and a curb's voiceless wrath.    Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,  And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path      To each man's heart that slew:  A face in a picture, striving amazedly;    The little maid who danced at her father's board,  The innocent voice man's love came never nigh,  Who joined to his her little paean-cry      When the third cup was poured....    What came thereafter I saw not neither tell.    But the craft of Calchas failed not.--'Tis written, He  Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.      And that which is to be,  Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour?    For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.  Only may good from all this evil flower;  So prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower      Guarding the land alone.      [_As they cease,_ CLYTEMNESTRA _comes from the Palace with Attendants.  She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face  the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her_.    LEADER.    Before thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes.  'Tis written, when the man's throne empty lies,  The woman shall be honoured.--Hast thou heard  Some tiding sure?  Or is it Hope, hath stirred  To fire these altars?  Dearly though we seek  To learn, 'tis thine to speak or not to speak.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Glad-voiced, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,  The Star-child of a dancing midnight born,  And beareth to thine ear a word of joy  Beyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy.    LEADER.    How?  Thy word flies past me, being incredible.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Ilion is ours. No riddling tale I tell.    LEADER.    Such joy comes knocking at the gate of tears.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Aye, 'tis a faithful heart that eye declares.    LEADER.    What warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    There is; unless a God hath lied there is.    LEADER.    Some dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Who deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes?    LEADER.    Some word within that hovereth without wings?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Am I a child to hearken to such things?    LEADER.    Troy fallen?--But how long? When fell she, say?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    The very night that mothered this new day.    LEADER.    And who of heralds with such fury came?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    A Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.  Whence starting, beacon after beacon burst  In flaming message hitherward. Ida first  Told Hermes' Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign  Was caught by towering Athos, the divine,  With pines immense--yea, fishes of the night  Swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,  Which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far  Makistos' watchmen marked a glimmering star;  They, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,  Spring up to hurl the fiery message on,  And a far light beyond the Euripus tells  That word hath reached Messapion's sentinels.  They beaconed back, then onward with a high  Heap of dead heather flaming to the sky.  And onward still, not failing nor aswoon,  Across the Asopus like a beaming moon  The great word leapt, and on Kithairon's height  Uproused a new relay of racing light.  His watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid  Their welcome, burning higher than was bid.  Out over Lake Gorgopis then it floats,  To Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,  Crying for \"F"]]]
