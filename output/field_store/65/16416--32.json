For our subject this means of information is as  complete as can be desired. The correspondence of the emigrants with  the Cape Government was the work of many individuals, and extended  over many years. The letters are usually of great length, badly  constructed, and badly spelt--the productions, in short, of  uneducated men; but so uniform is the vein of thought running through  them all, that there is not the slightest difficulty in condensing  them into a dozen pages. When analyzed, the statements contained in  them are found to consist of two charges, one against the Imperial  Government, the other against the agents in South Africa of the  London Missionary Society.    The Imperial Government was charged with exposing the white  inhabitants of the colony, without protection, to robbery and murder  by the blacks; with giving credence in every dispute to statements  made by interested persons in favour of savages, while refusing to  credit the testimony, no matter how reliable, of colonists of  European extraction; with liberating the slaves in an unjust manner;  and generally with such undue partiality for persons with black skins  and savage habits, as to make it preferable to seek a new home in the  wilderness than remain under the English flag.    The missionaries of the London Society were charged with usurping  authority that should properly belong to the civil magistrate; with  misrepresenting facts; and with advocating schemes directly hostile  to the progress of civilization, and to the observance of order. And  it was asserted that the influence of these missionaries was all  powerful at the Colonial Office in London, by which the colony,  without a voice in the management of its affairs, was then ruled  absolutely.    In support of the charges against the Imperial Government, the  emigrants dwelt largely upon the devastation of the eastern districts  by the Kaffirs' inroad of December, 1834, which was certainly  unprovoked by the colonists. Yet Lord Glenelg, who was then Secretary  of State for the Colonies, justified the Kaffirs, and not only  refused to punish them, but actually gave them a large slip of land,  including the dense jungles along the Fish River, that had long  been part of the colony; and made no other provision against the  recurrence of a destructive invasion than a series of treaties with a  number of barbarous chiefs, who had no regard for their engagements.  This event is the most prominent feature in the correspondence of  the emigrants; it is fairly recorded, and the language used is in  general much more moderate than that employed by the English  frontier colonists when relating the same circumstance.    Next stands the removal of all restraint from the coloured population  of the colony, without the protection to the whites of even a Vagrant  Act. Several of the colonial divisions had been for ten or twelve  years overrun by fugitives from the Basuto and Betshuana countries,  who had been driven from their own homes by the troubles already  recorded. These people were usually termed Mantatees or Makatees,  from the supposition that they were all subjects of Ma Ntatisi.  Towards the eastern frontiers Kaffirs, and after the war Fingos,  wandered about practically wherever they chose. In the remainder of  the colony Hottentots, free blacks, and mixed breeds came and went as  they pleased. How is it possible, said the farmers, for us to  cultivate the ground, or breed cattle, with all these savages and  semi-savages constantly watching for opportunities to plunder  us--with no police, and no law under which suspicious characters can  be arrested and made to account for their manner of living?    Much is said of the reproofs of Sir Benjamin D'Urban by the Secretary  of State, and, after 1838, of the dismissal of that Governor, (1) The  emigrants asserted that he was the best Governor the colony had had  since it became subject to England; they dwelt upon his benevolence,  his ability, his strict justice, his impartiality to white and black,  his efforts to promote civilization; and then they complained, in  words more bitter than are to be found when they referred to any  other subject, that the good Governor had been reproved, and finally  deprived of his office, because he had told the plain truth,  regardless of the London Missionary Society; and had endeavoured to  mete out to black criminals the same justice that he would have meted  out had they been white. There is now no one in South Africa who does  not agree with the emigrants in this matter. Nearly half a century  has passed away since Sir Benjamin D'Urban was forced into retirement  by Lord Glenelg; and during that period the principal measures which  he proposed have been approved of and adopted, while the successors  of those missionaries who were his bitter opponents are at present  among the strongest advocates of his system of dealing with the  natives.    Sir Benjamin D'Urban remained in South Africa, after being deprived  of office, until the reversal of his policy towards the natives was  admitted by most people even in England to have been a mistake. He  did not leave the Cape until April, 1846, just after the commencement  of the War of the Axe.    Concerning the liberation of the slaves, there is less in this  correspondence than one might reasonably expect to find. Many scores  of pages can be examined without any allusion whatever to it. Nowhere  is there a single word to be found in favour of slavery as an  institution; the view of the emigrants, with hardly an exception,  being fairly represented in the following sentence, taken from a  letter of the Volksraad at Natal to Sir George Napier: 'A long and  sad experience has sufficiently convinced us of the injury, loss, and  dearness of slave labour, so that neither slavery nor the slave trade  will ever be permitted among us.'    [The allusions to the emancipation of slaves, and to slavery as an  institution, will be considered by many to need some modification or  explanation. The Dutch even to-day speak of the emancipation as the  real cause of the great exodus; and the system of indenture, and  the treatment of natives generally by the Boers, cannot fairly be  regarded as warranting the view expressed by Mr. Theal in connection  with this letter to Sir George Napier.]    It is alleged, however, that the emancipation, as it was carried out,  was an act of confiscation. It is stated that most of the slaves were  brought to the colony in English ships, and sold by English subjects;  that when, in 1795, the colony was invited by English officers of  high rank to place itself under the protection of England, one of the  inducements held out was security in slave property; at the same time  those officers warning the colonists that if France obtained  possession she would liberate the slaves, as she had done in  Martinique, thereby ruining this colony as she had ruined that  island; that the English Government had recently and suddenly changed  its policy, and required them to conform to the change with equal  alacrity, whereas they were convinced that gradual emancipation, with  securities against vagrancy, was the only safe course. The  emancipation had been sudden, and the slaves had been placed upon a  perfect political equality with their former proprietors. The  missionaries applauded this as a noble and generous act of the  Imperial Government, and they were told that by everyone in England  it was so regarded. But at whose expense was this noble and generous  act carried out? Agents of the Imperial Government had appraised the  slaves, generally at less than their market value. Two-fifths of this  appraisement, being the share apportioned to the Cape out of the  twenty million pounds sterling voted by the Imperial Parliament, had  then been offered to the proprietors as compensation, if they chose  to go to London for it, otherwise they could only dispose of their  claims at a heavy discount. Thus, in point of fact, only about  one-third of the appraised amount had been received. To all  slave-holders this had meant a great reduction of wealth, while to  many of those who were in debt it was equivalent to the utter  deprivation of all property.    As regards the missionaries, a crusade was organized by some of these  worthies, who had themselves married Kaffir women, and who spared no  effort and showed no scruple in blackening the name of colonist.    The views and interests of the colonists and of these men were so  different that concord was hardly possible. The missionaries desired  that the blacks should be collected together in villages: the  colonists were unwilling that they should be thus withdrawn from  service. 'Teach them the first step in civilization, to labour  honestly for their maintenance, and add to that oral instruction in  the doctrines of Christianity,' said the colonists. 'Why should they  be debarred from learning to read and write? And as there can only be  schools if they are brought together in villages, why should they not  be collected together?' replied the missionaries.    Then came another and a larger question. By whom should the waste  places of the land, the vast areas which were without other occupants  than a few roving Bushmen, be peopled? 'By the white man,' said the  colonists; 'it is to the advantage of the world in all time to come  that the higher race should expand and be dominant here; it would be  treason to humanity to prevent its growth where it can grow without  wrong to others, or to plant an inferior stock where the superior can  take root and flourish.' 'By Africans,' said the missionaries; 'this  is African soil; and if mission stations are established on its  desolate tracts, people will be drawn to them from the far interior,  the community will grow rapidly, those enlightened by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16496"],[0,"Chronicles (1 of 6): The Historie of England (1 of 8) (#3)"],[1," name Bardi.  And it should seeme by doctor Caius and master Bale, that Caesar found  some of them here at his arriuall in this Ile, and reported that they had  also their first begining in the same. The profession and vsages of these  Bardi, Nonnius, Strabo, Diodorus, Stephanus, Bale, and sir Iohn Prise,  are in effect reported after this sort. They did vse to record the  noble exploits of the ancient capteins, and to drawe the pedegrees and  genealogies of such as were liuing. They would frame pleasant dities and  songs, learne the same by heart, and sing them to instruments at solemne  feasts and assemblies of noble men and gentlemen. Wherefore they were had  in so high estimation, that if two hosts had bene readie ranged to ioine  in battell, and that any of them had fortuned to enter among them, both  the hosts (as well the enimies as the friends) would haue holden their  hands, giuen eare vnto them, and ceassed from fight, vntill these Bards  [Sidenote: _Lucan. lib._ 1.]  had gone out of the battell. Of these Bards Lucane saith,        Vos quoq; qui fortes animas belloq; peremptas,    Laudius in longum vares dimittitis aeuum,    Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi:      [Sidenote: _II. F._]    And you o poet Bards from danger      void that dities sound,    Of soules of dreadlesse men, whom rage      of battell would confound,    And make their lasting praise to time      of later age rebound.      Because the names of these poets were neither discrepant from the  ciuilitie of the Romans, nor repugnant to the religion of the Christians,  they (of all the other sects before specified) were suffered onlie to  continue vnabolished in all ages, insomuch that there flourished of  them among the Britains (according to Bale) before the birth of Christ,  [Sidenote: _Iohn Bale script. Britan. cent._ 2.  _John Prise defen hist. Brit._  _Caius de ant._  _Cant. lib._ 1.  _Iohn Leland_  _syllab. ant dict._  _Hum. Lloyd de Mona insula_]  Plenidius and Oronius: after Christ (as Prise recounteth) Thalestine,  and the two Merlins, Melkin, Elaskirion, and others: and of late daies  among the Welshmen, Dauid Die, Ioslo Gough, Dauid ap William, with an  infinite number more. And in Wales there are sundrie of them (as Caius  reporteth) remaining vnto this day, where they are in their language  called (as Leland writeth) Barthes. Also by the witnes of Humfrey Llhoyd,  there is an Iland neere vnto Wales, called Insula Bardorum, and Bardsey,  whereof the one name in Latine, and the other in Saxon or old English,  signifieth the Iland of the Bardes or Barthes.    _Thus farre the gouernement of the Celts in this Ile._           *       *       *       *       *          AN APPENDIX TO THE FORMER CHAPTER.      [Sidenote: _Bale_]  After Bardus, the Celts (as Bale saith) loathing the streict ordinances  of their ancient kings, and betaking themselues to pleasure and idlenesse,  were in short time, and with small labour brought vnder the subiection of  the giant Albion, the sonne of Neptune, who altering the state of things  in this Iland, streicted the name of Celtica and the Celts within the  bounds of Gallia, from whence they came first to inhabit this land vnder  the conduct of Samothes, as before ye haue heard, accordinglie as Annius  [Sidenote: _Annius_.]  hath gathered out of Berosus the Chaldean, who therein agreeth also with  [Sidenote: _Theophilus_.]  the scripture, the saieng of Theophilus the doctor, and the generall  consent of all writers, which fullie consent, that the first inhabitants  of this Ile came out of the parties of Gallia, although some of them  dissent about the time and maner of their comming. Sir Brian Tuke  [Sidenote: _Sir Brian Tuke_.]  thinketh it to be ment of the arriuall of Brute, when he came out of  [Sidenote: _Caesar_.]  those countries into this Ile. Caesar and Tacitus seeme to be of opinion,  that those Celts which first inhabited here, came ouer to view the  [Sidenote: _Tacitus_.  _Bodinus_.]  countrie for trade of merchandize. Bodinus would haue them to come in (a  Gods name) from Languedoc, and so to name this land Albion, of a citie in  [Sidenote: _Beda_.  _Polydor_.]  Languedoc named Albie. Beda, and likewise Polydore (who followeth him)  affirme that they came from the coasts of Armorica, which is now called  little Britaine.    But that the authorities afore recited are sufficient to proue the time  that this Iland was first inhabited by the Celts, the old possessors of  Gallia; not onelie the neernesse of the regions, but the congruence  of languages, two great arguments of originals doo fullie confirme  [Sidenote: _Bodinus_.]  the same. Bodinus writeth vpon report, that the British and Celtike  language was all one. But whether that be true or not, I am not able to  affirme, bicause the Celtike toong is long sithens growne wholie out of  vse. Howbeit some such Celtike words as remaine in the writings of old  authours may be perceiued to agree with the Welsh toong, being the  [Sidenote: _Pausanias_]  vncorrupted speech of the ancient Britains. In deed Pausanias the  Grecian maketh mention how the Celts in their language called a horsse  _Marc_: and by that name doo the Welshmen call a horsse to this day:  and the word _Trimarc_ in Pausanias, signifieth in the Celtike toong,  three horsses.    Thus it appeared by the authoritie of writers, by situation of place, and  by affinitie of language, that this Iland was first found and inhabited  by the Celts, that there name from Samothes to Albion continued here  the space of 310 yeares or there abouts. And finallie it is likelie,  [Sidenote: _Iohn Bale_.]  that aswell the progenie as the speech of them is partlie remaining in  this Ile among the inhabitants, and speciallie the British, euen vnto  this day.           *       *       *       *       *          _Of the giant Albion, of his comming into this Iland, diuers opinions why  it was called Albion: why Albion and Bergion were slaine by Hercules: of  Danaus and of his 50 daughters._      THE THIRD CHAPTER.      [Sidenote: _Bale_.  _Annius de Viterbo_.  _Diodorus Sicubis_.  Pinnesses or gallies.  _Higinus_.  _Pictonius_.]  Neptunus called by Moses (as some take it) Nepthuim, the sixt sonne of  Osiris, after the account of Annius, and the brother of Hercules, had  appointed him of his father (as Diodorus writeth) the gouernement of the  ocean sea: wherefore he furnished himselfe of sundrie light ships for the  more redie passage by water, which in the end grew to the number of a  full nauie: & so by continuall exercise he became so skilfull, and  therewith so mightie vpon the waters (as Higinus & Pictonius doo write)  that he was not onelie called the king, but also esteemed the god of the  seas. He had to wife a ladie called Amphitrita, who was also honored as  goddesse of the seas, of whose bodie he begat sundrie children: and (as  Bale reporteth) he made euerie one of them king of an Iland. In the Ile  [Sidenote: _Scrip. Bri. cent._ 1.]  of Britaine he landed his fourth son called Albion the giant, who brought  the same vnder his subjection. And herevpon it resteth, that Iohn Textor,  [Sidenote: _Ioh. Textor_.  _Polydor_.]  and Polydor Virgil made mention, that light shippes were first inuented  in the British seas, and that the same were couered round with the hides  of beasts, for defending them from the surges and waues of the water.    This Albion being put by his father in possession of this Ile of  Britaine, within short time subdued the Samotheans, the first  inhabitantes thereof, without finding any great resistance, for that (as  before ye haue heard) they had giuen ouer the practise of all warlike  and other painefull exercises, and through vse of effeminate pleasures,  wherevnto they had giuen themselues ouer, they were become now vnapt to  withstand the force of their enimies: and so (by the testimonie of  [Sidenote: _Nichol. Perot._  _Rigmanus Philesius_.  _Aristotle_.  _Hum. Lhoyd_.]  Nicholaus Perottus, Rigmanus Philesius, Aristotle, and Humfrey Llhoyd,  with diuers other, both forraine & home-writers) this Iland was first  called by the name of Albion, hauing at one time both the name and  inhabitants changed from the line of Iaphet vnto the accursed race of Cham.    This Albion (that thus changed the name of this Ile) and his companie,  are called giants, which signifieth none other than a tall kind of men,  of that vncorrupt stature and highnesse naturallie incident to the first  [Sidenote: _Berosus_.]  age (which Berosus also seemeth to allow, where he writeth, that Noah  was one of the giants) and were not so called only of their monstrous  greatnesse, as the common people thinke (although in deed they exceeded  the vsuall stature of men now in these daies) but also for that they  tooke their name of the soile where they were borne: for _Gigantes_  [Sidenote: What _Gigantes_ signifie]  signifieth the sons of the earth: the Aborigines, or (as Cesar calleth  them) Indigenae; that is, borne and bred out of the earth where they  inhabited.    Thus some thinke, but verelie although that their opinion is not to be  allowed in any condition, which maintaine that there should be any  [Sidenote: _Against the opinion of the Aborigines_.]  Aborigines, or other kind of men than those of Adams line; yet that  there haue beene men of far greater stature than are now to be found,  is sufficientlie prooued by the huge bones of those that haue beene  found in our time, or lately before: whereof here to make further  relation it shall not need, sith in the description of Britaine ye  shall find it sufficientlie declared.    [Sidenote: _Bale_.  Bergion brother to Albion.  Hercules Lybicus.]  But now to our purpose. As Albion held Britaine in subiection, so his  brother Bergion kept Ireland and the Orkenies vnder his rule and  dominion, and hearing that their coosine Hercules Lybicus hauing  finished his conquests in Spaine, meant to passe through Gallia into  Italie, against their"]]]
