The two designs receiving honorable mention will receive special bronze  medals.    The three prize drawings shall become the property of the Chicago  Architectural Club.    AN ART SCHOOL.--A gentleman wishing to share his large and valuable  collection of paintings, statuary and architectural fragments with his  townsmen, has decided to place them in a building which he proposes to  erect for the study of architecture, painting and sculpture.    The building is to face the town square, and is to be not more than one  hundred and fifty feet in its greatest dimensions.    It shall consist of one story and a high basement.    The first story shall contain the following rooms:    1st. A large entrance gallery for the placing and hanging of statuary  and paintings. This hall should be the main feature of the plan, and  should be carefully arranged for convenient and advantageous display,  without destroying the architectural effect. It may be one continuous  hall or divided into parts, at the discretion of the architect. It may  be lighted from above.    2d. A large glass-covered court to contain architectural fragments.    3d. An amphitheatre, to seat about two hundred, for lectures on art  subjects. A library and an assembly hall.    4th. Four class rooms. These rooms should be well-lighted and of easy  access to the court and gallery.    5th. A janitor's room and an office for the custodian. These rooms may  be small, but should be conveniently placed either at the entrance to  the building or to the grounds.    As the number of the students is limited, the size of the rooms is of  less importance than the circulation, convenience and artistic beauty of  the whole.    The building, being the home of the arts, should be pure in style and  classical in feeling, though not necessarily archaeological.    Drawings required, viz.: One plan and one section at the scale of  one-sixteenth of an inch to one foot, and the front elevation at the  scale of one-eighth of an inch to one foot.    Drawings to be rendered at will; to be mounted on strainers 28x40,  without frames or glass.    A sealed envelope containing the name and full address of the author,  with place and date of birth, must be securely fastened to each drawing;  the drawings and envelopes themselves must not be marked by a device of  any kind.    Drawings must be delivered to John Robert Dillon, secretary, Chicago  Architectural Club, at the club house, 274 Michigan Avenue, Chicago, on  or before Friday, November 15, 1895, charges to be prepaid. All drawings  not receiving prizes will be returned at the expense of the contributor.          L.J. MILLET, Chairman;      R.C. SPENCER, JR.      IRVING K.

The death of Richard Morris Hunt, at Newport, R.I., on July 31, deprives  the architectural profession in this country of the man who, since the  death of Mr. Richardson, has been its most distinguished representative.  His influence upon American architecture is possibly less directly  traceable than that of Richardson, and was more of a personal nature  through association with his brother architects, while Richardson's  example was his most important legacy to the profession.    Mr. W.S. Hebbard will, on September 1, occupy new offices in the Grant  Building, San Diego, Cal., which he is just completing for U.S. Grant,  Jr., Esq.    Among the recent additions to the working force of Mr. Aiken,  Supervising Architect of the Treasury, are Mr. F.B. Wheaton, formerly  with Messrs. Longfellow, Alden, & Harlow, and Mr. Rice, formerly with  Wheelwright & Haven.    Mr. Geo. H. Ingraham, who has recently opened an office at 6 Beacon  Street, Boston, is now absent on a short European trip.    Mr. George E. Barton, for several years with Cram, Wentworth, & Goodhue,  of Boston, has just started for a tour of England and France, with the  special purpose of studying the domestic and church architecture of the  smaller cities and towns.    Mr. C.H. Alden, who has lately returned from six months' travel, mostly  in Italy, has made a careful study of the brick and terra-cotta  architecture of Northern Italy. He has just entered the office of  Messrs. Wyatt and Noelting, Baltimore.    Each year since the University of Pennsylvania Traveling Scholarship was  founded, a prominent member of the T Square Club has been the winner;  and that Mr. Percy Ash, ex-president of this club, should carry off the  prize this year is particularly gratifying.    Mr. Ash has twice before competed, and each time came out a close  second; but his old luck did not entirely forsake him, for in his  venture for the Roman Scholarship Prize he was very near to the front,  winning honorable mention.    H.L. Duhring, Jr., was a close second for the U. of P. Scholarship.    At the last regular T Square Club meeting, but two sets of drawings were  submitted. The program called for a \"Garden for a Palatial Country  House,\" and required a plan of the house and terrace at 1/8\" scale,  and a plan and section of the entire garden at a scale of 1/32 of an  inch.    The problem was modeled after the _projet_ given at the Ecole des  Beaux-Arts, and required so vast an amount of graded wash work in color,  as to intimidate many of the regular competitors. A.C. Munoz, who won  first mention, submitted three drawings, two of them nearly three by  four feet, while Albert Kelsey was disqualified for not having fulfilled  the requirements by omiting the 1/8\" scale plan.    Some discussion advocating the postponement of the competition took  place, but Kelsey seemed to prefer being disqualified rather than  further exert himself; and possibly the knowledge that three draughtsmen  in Day's office and two in Cope & Stewardson's office had two unfinished  designs to complete, may have influenced him. In spite of the result of  this competition the eleven points previously won by Mr. Kelsey give him  the highest average for the past year's work.               *       *       *       *       *      Notes.    Of the many minor or industrial arts which enter into a complete  architectural production, that of the smith is one of the most  fascinating, and strangely enough, it is one which at the present time  has the fewest workers who can be worthily compared with those of the  past. In the estimation of many of the most prominent and exacting  architects of the country there is but one maker of ornamental wrought  iron in America who can be trusted to intelligently carry out the spirit  of a fine design. Why this should be so it is hard to say, but the fact  remains that most of the best iron work done in this country in recent  years has come from the shop of John Williams of New York; and  architects, it may be said, instinctively turn to him for work of this  class.    The characteristics which distinctively belong to the art of the smith,  the limitations of material and the purpose for which the finished work  is intended are all taken into account and each element given its due  importance. To Mr. H.B. Stillman, associated with Mr. Williams, who has  for a number of years taken personal charge of this branch of the  business, is largely due the success which has attended the efforts of  his house.    [Illustration]    The suburban house architecture of the towns about Boston is of  exceptional interest and its quality is generally considered to be  equal, if not superior, to that of any other locality in the country.  The reason for its superiority in design and consequent interest is  largely traceable to the influence of such architects as Peabody &  Stearns, Winslow & Wetherell, Andrews, Jaques & Rantoul, Hartwell &  Richardson and a number of others who have given especial attention to  residence work.    One of the most attractive collections of houses of this class which we  have seen is contained in a finely printed little booklet issued by  Dexter Bros., of Boston. It contains photographic illustrations of  eleven houses designed by the architects named above, and others. The  houses themselves are hardly more attractive than the excellently chosen  and finely reproduced photographic views. Messrs. Dexter Bros., upon  application, will send this booklet to any architect or draughtsman.    For fastening any sort of work to stone or brick the clever expansion  bolt, patented and manufactured by Isaac Church, of Toledo, is, on every  count, the best device to specify. Patterns for every special use  imaginable are made by him and fully described in his catalogue."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],[0,"Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#3)"],[1,"ground with him. And that's how the old  gentleman rabbit got down out of the tree, just as I told you he would.    So he and the crow walked on some distance through the woods together,  after Uncle Wiggily had picked up his crutch and valise, which had fallen  out of the basket, and they got safely away before the alligator came out  of the water. And wasn't he the provoked old beastie, though, when he saw  that his rabbit supper was gone?    \"Where are you going?\" asked the crow of Uncle Wiggily, after a bit, when  they got to a nice big stone, and sat down for a rest.    \"I am seeking my fortune,\" replied the old gentleman rabbit, \"and trying  to get better of my rheumatism. Dr. Possum told me to travel, and have  adventures, and I've had quite a few already.\"    \"Well, I hope you find your fortune and that it turns out to be a very  good one,\" said the kind crow. \"But it is coming on night now. Have you  any place to stay?\"    \"No,\" replied the rabbit, \"I haven't. I never thought about that. What  shall I do?\"    \"Oh, don't worry,\" said the crow. \"I'd let you stay in my nest, but it is  up a high tree, and you would have trouble climbing in and out. But near  my nest-house is an old hollow stump, and you can stay in that very  nicely.\"    \"Are there any bears in it?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, careful-like.    \"Oh, no; not a one. It is very safe.\"    So the crow showed Uncle Wiggily where the hollow stump was, and he slept  there all night, on a soft bed of leaves. And when he awakened in the  morning he had breakfast with the crow and once more started off to seek  his fortune.    Well, pretty soon, in a short while, not so very long, he came to a little  house made of bark, standing in the middle of a deep, dark, dismal woods.  And on the door of the house was a sign which read:    \"If you want to be surprised, open this door and come in.\"    \"Perhaps I can find my fortune in there, and get rid of the rheumatism,\"  thought Uncle Wiggily, so he hopped forward. And just as he did so he  heard a voice calling to him:    \"Don't go in! Don't go in there, Uncle Wiggily!\"    The rabbit looked up, and saw Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boy, waving  his paws at him. Well, Uncle Wiggily started to jump back away from the  door of the little house, but it was too late. Out came a  scraggily-raggily claw, which grabbed him, while a voice cried out:    \"Ah, ha! Now I have you! Come right in!\"    And then, before you could shake a stick at a bad dog, the door was  slammed shut and locked, and there Uncle Wiggily was inside the house, and  Johnnie Bushytail was crying outside.    \"That's the end of poor Uncle Wiggily!\" said Johnnie. But it wasn't. For  I'll not leave the old gentleman rabbit alone in the house with that clawy  creature. And in the next story, providing our wash lady doesn't put my  new straw hat in the soap suds, and take all the color out of the ribbon,  I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Fido Flip-Flop.          STORY IV    UNCLE WIGGILY AND FIDO FLIP-FLOP      Well, as soon as Uncle Wiggily found himself inside the bear's den--oh,  just listen to me! That was in the other story, wasn't it? Yes, we left  him in the funny little house in the woods, with the clawy creature  grabbing him.    Now, what do you suppose that clawy creature was? Why, a great, big owl,  to be sure, with round, staring, yellow eyes, and he had grabbed Uncle  Wiggily in his claws, and pulled him inside the house.    \"Now, I've got you!\" cried the owl. \"I was just wishing some one would  come along, and you did. Some of my friends are coming to tea this  afternoon, and you'll do very nicely made up into sandwiches.\"    Wasn't that a perfectly dreadful way to talk about our Uncle Wiggily?  Well, I guess yes!    \"Now you're here, make yourself at home,\" went on the owl, sarcastic-like,  as he locked the front door and put the key in his pocket. \"Did you see  the sign?\"    \"Yes,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"I did. But I don't call it fair. I thought I  would find my fortune in here.\"    \"The sign says you'll be surprised, and I guess you are surprised, aren't  you?\" asked the owl.    \"Yes,\" answered the rabbit, \"very much so. But I'd rather have a nice  surprise party, with peanuts and lemonade, than this.\"    \"No matter,\" said the owl, snapping his beak like a pair of shears, \"here  you are and here you'll stay! My friends will soon arrive. I'll now put  the kettle on, to boil for tea.\"    Well, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what to do. He couldn't look in his  valise to see if there was anything in it by which he might escape, for he  had dropped the satchel outside when the owl grabbed him, and he only had  his barber-pole crutch.    \"Oh, this is worse and worse!\" thought the poor old rabbit.    But listen, Johnnie Bushytail is outside the owl's house, and he's going  to do a wonderful trick.    As soon as he saw the door shut on Uncle Wiggily, that brave squirrel boy  began to plan how he could save him, and the first thing he did was to  gather up a lot of acorns.    Then he perched himself in a tree, right in front of the owl's door, and  Johnnie began throwing acorns at it. \"Rat-a-tat-tat!\" went the acorns on  the wooden panels.    \"Ha! Those must be my friends!\" exclaimed the bad owl, opening the door a  little crack so he could peek out, but taking care to stand in front of  it, so that Uncle Wiggily couldn't slip out. But, of course, the owl saw  no one. \"It must have been the wind,\" he said as he shut the door.    Then Johnnie Bushytail threw some more acorns at the door.  \"Pitter-patter-patter-pit!\" they went, like hailstones in an ice cream  can.    \"Ah, there are my friends, sure, this time!\" thought the owl, and once  more he peered out, but no one was there. \"It must have been a tree branch  hitting against the door,\" said the owl, as he sharpened a big knife with  which to make the sandwiches. Then Johnnie threw some more acorns, and the  owl now thought positively his friends were there, and when he opened it  and saw no one he was real mad.    \"Some one is playing tricks on me!\" exclaimed the savage bird. \"I'll catch  them next time!\"    Now this was just what Johnnie Bushytail wanted, so he threw a whole  double handful of acorns at the door, and when the owl heard them  pattering against the wood he rushed out.    \"Now, I've got you!\" he cried, but he hadn't, for Johnnie was up a tree.  And, for the moment, the owl forgot about Uncle Wiggily, and there the  door was wide open.    \"Run out, Uncle Wiggily! Run out!\" cried Johnnie, and out the old  gentleman rabbit hopped, catching up his valise, and away into the woods  he ran, with Johnnie scurrying along in the tree tops above him, and  laughing at the owl, who flew back to his house, but too late to catch the  bunny.    \"That's what you get for fooling people so they'll come into your house,\"  called the squirrel boy. \"It serves you right, Mr. Owl. Come on, Uncle  Wiggily, we'll get away from here.\"    So they went on together until it was time for Johnnie to go home, and he  said he'd tell Uncle Wiggily's friends that he had met the old gentleman  rabbit, and that he hadn't found his fortune yet, but that he was looking  for it every minute, and had had many adventures.    Well, Uncle Wiggily went on some more, for quite a distance, until it was  noon time, and then he sat down in the cool, green woods, where there were  some jacks-in-the-pulpit growing near some ferns, and there Uncle Wiggily  ate his lunch of lettuce sandwiches, with carrot butter on them, and  gnawed on a bit of potato. Just as he was almost through, he heard a  rustling in the bushes, and a voice exclaimed:    \"Oh, dear!\"    \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, thinking perhaps an  adventure was going to happen to him. \"Who are you?\"    \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed the voice again.    Then, before the old rabbit could jump up and run away, even if he had  wanted to, out from under a big bush came a little white poodle dog, with  curly, silky hair. He walked right up to Uncle Wiggily, that dog did, and  the rabbit wasn't a bit afraid, for the dog wasn't much bigger than he  was, and looked very kind.    \"What do you want, doggie?\" gently asked Uncle Wiggily.    The dog didn't answer, but he gave a little short bark, and then he began  turning somersaults. Over and over he went, sometimes backward and  sometimes frontward, and sometimes sideways. And when he was finished, he  made a low bow, and walked around on his two hind legs, just to show he  wasn't proud or stuck up.    \"There!\" exclaimed the poodle doggie. \"Is that worth something to eat, Mr.  Rabbit?\"    \"Indeed it is,\" answered Uncle Wiggily, \"but I would have given you  something to eat without you doing all those tricks, though I enjoyed them  very much. Where did you learn to do them?\"    \"Oh, in the circus where I used to be, I always had to do tricks for my  dinner,\" said the doggie.    \"What is your name?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"Fido Flip-Flop,\" was the answer. \"You see they call me that because I  turn so many flip-flops,\" and then Uncle Wiggily gave him some lunch, and  told the dog about how he, himself, was traveling all over in search of  his fortune.    \"Why, that's just what I'm doing, too,\" exclaimed Fido Flip-Flop. \"Suppose  we travel together? and maybe we'll each find a fortune.\"    \"That's just what we'll do,\" agreed Uncle Wiggily.    And then, all of a sudden, before you could open your eyes and shut them  again, two savage foxes jumped out from behind a big stump.    \"You grab the dog and I'll grab the rabbit,\" called the biggest fox, and  right at Uncle Wiggily and Fido they sprang, gnashing their teeth.    But don't worry. I'll find a way to save them, and if the canary bird  doesn't take my lead pencil and stick it in his seed dish I'll tell you in  the following story about Uncle Wiggily doing some tricks.
