Then it came Lane's turn, and what they said or did he scarcely knew,  until Margaret kissed him. \"Oh, Dare! I'm _so_ glad to see you home.\"  Tears were standing in her clear blue eyes. \"You're changed,  but--not--not so much as Blair.\"    Lane responded as best he could, and presently he found himself  standing at the curb, watching the car move away.    \"Come out to-morrow,\" called back Blair.    The Maynard's car was carrying his comrades away. His first feeling  was one of gladness--the next of relief. He could be alone now--alone  to find out what had happened to him, and to this strange Middleville.  An old negro wearing a blue uniform accosted Lane, shook hands with  him, asked him if he had any baggage. \"Yas sir, I sho knowed you,  Mistah Dare Lane. But you looks powerful bad.\"    Lane crossed the station platform, and the railroad yard and tracks,  to make a short cut in the direction of his home. He shrank from  meeting any one. He had not sent word just when he would arrive,  though he had written his mother from New York that it would be soon,  He was glad that no one belonging to him had been at the station. He  wanted to see his mother in his home. Walking fast exhausted him, and  he had to rest. How dead his legs felt! In fact he felt queer all  over. The old burn and gnaw in his breast had expanded to a heavy,  full, suffocating sensation. Yet his blood seemed to race. Suddenly an  overwhelming emotion of rapture flooded over him. Home at last! He did  not think of any one. He was walking across the railroad yards where  as a boy he had been wont to steal rides on freight trains. Soon he  reached the bridge. In the gathering twilight he halted to clutch at  the railing and look out across where the waters met--where Sycamore  Creek flowed into Middleville River. The roar of water falling over  the dam came melodiously and stirringly to his ears. And as he looked  again he was assailed by that strange sense of littleness, of  shrunkenness, which had struck him so forcibly at the station. He  listened to the murmur of running water. Then, while the sweetness of  joy pervaded him, there seemed to rise from below or across the river  or from somewhere the same strange misgiving, a keener dread, a chill  that was not in the air, a fatal portent of the future. Why should  this come to mock him at such a sacred and beautiful moment?    Passers-by stared at Lane, and some of them whispered, and one  hesitated, as if impelled to speak. Wheeling away Lane crossed the  bridge, turned up River Street, soon turned off again into a darker  street, and reaching High School Park he sat down to rest again. He  was almost spent. The park was quiet and lonely. The bare trees showed  their skeleton outlines against the cold sky. It was March and the air  was raw and chilly. This park that had once been a wonderful place now  appeared so small. Everything he saw was familiar yet grotesque in the  way it had become dwarfed. Across the street from where he sat lights  shone in the windows of a house. He knew the place. Who lived there?  One of the girls--he had forgotten which. From somewhere the  discordance of a Victrola jarred on Lane's sensitive ears.    Lifting his bag he proceeded on his way, halting every little while to  catch his breath. When he turned a corner into a side street,  recognizing every tree and gate and house, there came a gathering and  swelling of his emotions and he began to weaken and shake. He was  afraid he could not make it half way up the street. But he kept on.  The torture now was more a mingled rapture and grief than the physical  protest of his racked body. At last he saw the modest little  house--and then he stood at the gate, quivering. Home! A light in the  window of his old room! A terrible and tremendous storm of feeling  forced him to lean on the gate. How many endless hours had the  pictured memory of that house haunted him? There was the beloved room  where he had lived and slept and read, and cherished over his books  and over his compositions a secret hope and ambition to make of  himself an author. How strange to remember that! But it was true. His  day labor at Manton's office, for all the years since he had graduated  from High School, had been only a means to an end. No one had dreamed  of his dream. Then the war had come and now his hope, if not his  faith, was dead. Never before had the realization been so galling, so  bitter. Endlessly and eternally he must be concerned with himself. He  had driven that habit of thought away a million times, but it would  return. All he had prayed for was to get home--only to reach home  alive--to see his mother, and his sister Lorna--and Helen--and  then.... But he was here now and all that prayer was falsehood. Just  to get home was not enough.. He had been cheated of career, love,  happiness.    It required extreme effort to cross the little yard, to mount the  porch. In a moment more he would see his mother. He heard her within,  somewhere at the back of the house. Wherefore he tip-toed round to the  kitchen door. Here he paused, quaking. A cold sweat broke out all over  him. Why was this return so dreadful? He pressed a shaking hand over  his heart. How surely he knew he could not deceive his mother! The  moment she saw him, after the first flash of joy, she would see the  wreck of the boy she had let go to war. Lane choked over his emotion,  but he could not spare her. Opening the door he entered.    There she stood at the stove and she looked up at the sound he made.  Yes! but stranger than all other changes was the change in her. She  was not the mother of his boyhood. Nor was the change alone age or  grief or wasted cheek. The moment tore cruelly at Lane's heart. She  did not recognize him swiftly. But when she did....    \"Oh God!... Daren! My boy!\" she whispered.    \"Mother!\"          CHAPTER II      His mother divined what he knew. And her embrace was so close, almost  fierce in its tenderness, her voice so broken, that Lane could only  hide his face over her, and shut his eyes, and shudder in an ecstasy.  God alone had omniscience to tell what his soul needed, but something  of it was embodied in home and mother.    That first acute moment past, he released her, and she clung to his  hands, her face upturned, her eyes full of pain and joy, and woman's  searching power, while she broke into almost incoherent speech; and he  responded in feeling, though he caught little of the content of her  words, and scarcely knew what he was saying.    Then he reeled a little and the kitchen dimmed in his sight. Sinking  into a chair and leaning on the table he fought his weakness. He came  close to fainting. But he held on to his sense, aware of his mother  fluttering over him. Gradually the spell passed.    \"Mother--maybe I'm starved,\" he said, smiling at her.    That practical speech released the strain and inspired his mother to  action. She began to bustle round the kitchen, talking all the while.  Lane watched her and listened, and spoke occasionally. Once he asked  about his sister Lorna, but his mother either did not hear or chose  not to reply. All she said was music to his ears, yet not quite what  his heart longed for. He began to distrust this strange longing. There  was something wrong with his mind. His faculties seemed too sensitive.  Every word his mother uttered was news, surprising, unusual, as if it  emanated from a home-world that had changed. And presently she dropped  into complaint at the hard times and the cost of everything.    \"Mother,\" he interrupted, \"I didn't blow my money. I've saved nearly a  year's pay. It's yours.\"    \"But, Daren, you'll need money,\" she protested.    \"Not much. And maybe--I'll be strong enough to go to work--presently,\"  he said, hopefully. \"Do you think Manton will take me back--half days  at first?\"    \"I have my doubts, Daren,\" she replied, soberly. \"Hattie Wilson has  your old job. And I hear they're pleased with her. Few of the boys got  their places back.\"    \"Hattie Wilson!\" exclaimed Lane. \"Why, she was a kid in the eighth  grade when I left home.\"    \"Yes, my son. But that was nearly three years ago. And the children  have sprung up like weeds. Wild weeds!\"    \"Well! That tousle-headed Wilson kid!\" mused Lane. An uneasy  conviction of having been forgotten dawned upon Lane. He remembered  Blair Maynard's bitter prophecy, which he had been unable to accept.    \"Anyway, Daren, are you able to work?\" asked his mother.    \"Sure,\" he replied, lying cheerfully, with a smile on his face. \"Not  hard work, just yet, but I can do something.\"    His mother did not share his enthusiasm. She went on preparing the  supper.    \"How do you manage to get along?\" inquired Lane.    \"Lord only knows,\" she replied, sombrely. \"It has been very hard. When  you left home I had only the interest on your father's life insurance.  I sold the farm--\"    \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Lane, with a rush of boyhood memories.    \"I had to,\" she went on. \"I made that money help out for a long time.  Then I--I mortgaged this place.... Things cost so terribly. And Lorna  had to have so much more.... But she's just left school and gone to  work. That helps.\"    \"Lorna left school!\" ejaculated Lane, incredulously. \"Why, mother, she  was only a child. Thirteen years old when I left! She'll miss her  education. I'll send her back.\"    \"Well, son, I doubt if you can make Lorna do anything she doesn't want  to do,\" returned his mother. \"She wanted to quit school--to earn  money. Whatever she was when you left home she's grown up now. You'll  not know her.\"    \"Know Lorna! Why, mother dear, I carried Lorna's picture all through  the war.\"    \"You won't know her,\" returned Mrs. Lane, positively. \"My boy, these  years so short to you have been ages here at home. You will find your  sister--different from the little girl you left. You'll find all the  girls you knew changed--changed. I have given up trying to"]]]
