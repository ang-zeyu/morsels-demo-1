He remained under ordinary circumstances invisible to mortal eyes,  and he could conceal his identity even from the highest gods, but he  occasionally manifested himself in human form. He borrowed in such case  from Assyria the symbol of Assur, and the sculptors depict him with the  upper part of his body rising above that winged disk which is carved in  a hovering attitude on the pediments of Assyrian monuments or stelae.    [Illustration: 012b.jpg HYPOSTYLE OF HALL OF XERXES: DETAIL OF  ENTABLATURE]    In later days he was portrayed under the form of a king of imposing  stature and majestic mien, who revealed himself from time to time to the  princes of Iran.*         * In a passage of Philo of Byblos the god is described as       having the head of a falcon or an eagle, perhaps by       confusion with one of the genii represented on the walls of       the palaces.    [Illustration: 013.jpg AN IRANIAN GENIUS IN FORM OF A WINGED BULL]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.    He was named Ahuro-mazdao or Ahura-mazda, the omniscient lord,*  _Spento-mainyus_, the spirit of good, _Mainyus-spenishto_** the most  beneficent of spirits.         * _Ahura_ is derived from _Ahu_ = _Lord_: Mazdao can be       analysed into the component parts, _maz = great_, and _dao       = he who knows_. At first the two terms were       interchangeable, and even in the Gathas the form Mazda Ahura       is employed much more often than the form Ahura Mazda. In       the Achsemenian inscriptions, Auramazda is only found as a       single word, except in an inscription of Xerxes, where the       two terms are in one passage separated and declined _Aurahya       mazdaha_. The form Ormuzd, Ormazd, usually employed by       Europeans, is that assumed by the name in modern Persian.         ** These two names are given to him more especially in       connection with his antagonism to Angromainyus.    Himself uncreated, he is the creator of all things, but he is assisted  in the administration of the universe by legions of beings, who are all  subject to him.*         * Darius styles Ahura-mazda, _mathishta baganam_, the       greatest of the gods, and Xerxes invokes the protection of       Ahura-mazda along with that of the gods. The classical       writers also mention gods alongside of Ahura-mazda as       recognised not only among the Achaemenian Persians, but also       among the Parthians. Darmesteter considers that the earliest       Achaemenids worshipped Ahura-mazda alone, \"placing the other       gods together in a subordinate and anonymous group: May       Ahura-mazda and the other gods protect me.\"    [Illustration: 014.jpg AHURA-MAZDA BESTOWING THE TOKENS OF ROYALTY ON AN  IRANIAN KING]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Dieulafoy.    The most powerful among his ministers were originally nature-gods, such  as the sun, the moon, the earth, the winds, and the waters. The sunny  plains of Persia and Media afforded abundant witnesses of their power,  as did the snow-clad peaks, the deep gorges through which rushed roaring  torrents, and the mountain ranges of Ararat or Taurus, where the  force of the subterranean fires was manifested by so many startling  exhibitions of spontaneous conflagration.* The same spiritualising  tendency which had already considerably modified the essential concept  of Ahura-mazda, affected also that of the inferior deities, and tended  to tone down in them the grosser traits of their character. It had  already placed at their head six genii of a superior order, six  ever-active energies, who, after assisting their master at the creation  of the universe, now presided under his guidance over the kingdoms and  forces of nature.**         * All these inferior deities, heroes, and genii who presided       over Persia, the royal family, and the different parts of       the empire, are often mentioned in the most ancient       classical authors that have come down to us.         ** The six Amesha-spentas, with their several       characteristics, are enumerated in a passage of the _De       Iside_. This exposition of Persian doctrine is usually       attributed to Theopompus, from which we may deduce the       existence of a belief in the Amesha-spentas in the       Achsemenian period. J. Darmesteter affirms, on the contrary,       that \"the author describes the Zoro-astrianism of his own       times (the second century A.D.), and quotes Theopompus for a       special doctrine, that of the periods of the world's life.\"       Although this last point is correct, the first part of       Darmesteter's theory does not seem to me justified by       investigation. The whole passage of Plutarch is a well-       arranged composition of uniform style, which may be regarded       as an exposition of the system described by Theopompus,       probably in the eighth of his Philippics.

These benevolent and immortal beings--_Amesha-spentas_--were, in the  order of precedence, Vohu-mano (good thought), Asha-vahista (perfect  holiness), Khshathra-vairya (good government), Spenta-armaiti (meek  piety), Haurvatat (health), Ameretat (immortality). Each of them had  a special domain assigned to him in which to display his energy  untrammelled: Vohu-mano had charge of cattle, Asha-vahista of fire,  Khshathra-vairya of metals, Spenta-armaiti of the earth, Haurvatat and  Ameretat of vegetation and of water. They were represented in human  form, either masculine as Vohu-mano and Asha-vahista,* or feminine as  Spenta-armaiti, the daughter and spouse of Ahura-mazda, who became  the mother of the first man, Gayomaretan, and, through Gayomaretan,  ancestress of the whole human race.         * The image of Asha-vahista is known to us from coins of the       Indo-Scythian kings of Bactriana. Vohu-mano is described as       a young man.    [Illustration: 017a.jpg ATAR THE GOD OF FIRE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin of King Kanishka,       published by Percy Gardner.

Sometimes Ahura-mazda is himself included among the Amesha-spentas, thus  bringing their number up to seven; sometimes his place is taken by a  certain Sraosha (obedience to the law), the first who offered sacrifice  and recited the prayers of the ritual. Subordinate to these great  spirits were the Yazatas, scattered by thousands over creation,  presiding over the machinery of nature and maintaining it in working  order. Most of them received no special names, but many exercised wide  authority, and several were accredited by the people with an influence  not less than that of the greater deities themselves. Such Were the  regent of the stars--Tishtrya, the bull with golden horns, Sirius, the  sparkling one; Mao, the moon-god; the wind, Vato; the atmosphere, Vayu,  the strongest of the strong, the warrior with golden armour, who gathers  the storm and hurls it against the demon; Atar, fire under its principal  forms, divine fire, sacred fire, and earthly fire; Vere-thraghna, the  author of war and giver of victory; Aurva-taspa, the son of the waters,  the lightning born among the clouds; and lastly, the spirit of the dawn,  the watchful Mithra, \"who, first of the celestial Yazatas, soars above  Mount Hara,* before the immortal sun with his swift steeds, who, first  in golden splendour, passes over the beautiful mountains and casts his  glance benign on the dwellings of the Aryans.\"**         * Hara is Haroberezaiti, or Elburz, the mountain over which       the sun rises, \"around which many a star revolves, where       there is neither night nor darkness, no wind of cold or       heat, no sickness leading to a thousand kinds of death, nor       infection caused by the Daovas, and whose summit is never       reached by the clouds.\"         ** This is the Mithra whose religion became so powerful in       Alexandrian and Roman times. His sphere of action is defined       in the Bundehesh.    Mithra was a charming youth of beautiful countenance, his head  surrounded with a radiant halo. The nymph Anahita was adored under the  form of one of the incarnations of the Babylonian goddess Mylitta, a  youthful and slender female, with well-developed breasts and broad hips,  sometimes represented clothed in furs and sometimes nude.* Like the  foreign goddess to whom she was assimilated, she was the dispenser of  fertility and of love; the heroes of antiquity, and even Ahura-mazda  himself, had vied with one another in their worship of her, and she had  lavished her favours freely on all.**         * The popularity of these two deities was already well       established at the period we are dealing with, for Herodotus       mentions Mithra and confuses him with Anahita.         ** Her name Ardvi-Sura Anahita seems to signify _the lofty       and immaculate power_.    The less important Yazatas were hardly to be distinguished from the  innumerable multitude of Fravashis. The Fravasliis are the divine types  of all intelligent beings. They were originally brought into being by  Ahura-mazda as a distinct species from the human, but they had allowed  themselves to be entangled in matter, and to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"had spread all over Palestine.  Greek towns were founded, theatres and gymnasia established; Greek  art was admired and her philosophy studied. The Hellenic movement was  paramount, and the aristocratic families did their best to further it.  Even the high priests, like Jason and Menelaos, who were supposed to be  the guardians of the national exclusive movement, favoured Greek culture  and institutions.    In the mother country, however, the germ of reaction was always very  strong. A constant opposition was directed against the influx of  foreign modes of life and thought, which effaced and obliterated the  intellectual movement. It was different, however, in the other countries  of Macedonian dominion, and especially in Egypt. Alexander the Great,  who seems to have been favourably inclined towards the Jews, settled a  number of them in Alexandria. His policy was kept up by the descendants  of Lagos, that great general of Alexander, who made himself king of the  province which was entrusted to the care of his administration. Egypt  became the resort of many refugees from Judaea, who gradually came under  the influence of the dazzling Greek thought and culture, so new and  therefore so attractive to the Semitic mind. Hellenism and Hebraism had  known each other for some time, for Phoenician merchants and seafarers  had carried the seed of Oriental wisdom to the distant west. The  acquaintance, however, was a slight one. At the court of the Ptolemies,  on the threshold of Europe and Asia, they met at last. On the shores  of the Mediterranean, on the soil where lay the traces of the ancient  Egyptian civilisation, in the silent avenues of mysterious sphinxes,  amongst hieroglyphic-covered obelisks, Greek and Hebrew thought stood  face to face. The two civilisations embodied the principles of the  Beautiful and the Sublime, of Morality and AEstheticism, of religious  and philosophic speculation. The result of this meeting marks a glorious  page in the annals of human thought. Among the monuments of a great  historic past, the speculative spirit of the East made love to the  plastic beauty of the West, until, at last, they were united in happy  union. Hellenic taste and sense of beauty and Semitic speculation not  only evolved side by side in Egypt but mixed and commingled; their  thoughts were intertwined and interwoven, giving rise to a new  intellectual movement, a new philosophy of thought: the Judaeo-Hellenic.  Alexandrian culture, during the reign of the Ptolemies, is the offspring  of a mixed marriage between two parents belonging to two widely  different races, and, as a cross breed, is endowed with many qualities.  It had the seriousness of the one parent and the delicacy of the other.    The Ptolemies encouraged the movement towards fusion. The result was  that the Jews in Egypt, not being hampered by reactionary endeavours  from the side of conservative parties, and with an adaptability peculiar  to their race, soon acquired the language of the people in whose midst  they dwelt. They conversed and wrote in Greek; they moulded and shaped  their own thoughts into Greek form; they clothed the Semitic mode of  thinking in Hellenic garb. The immediate result was the translation of  the Pentateuch into Greek. Vanity, of which no individual or race is  free, had embellished this literary production, which has acquired a  high degree of importance alike among Jews and Christians, with many  legends. This translation, known as the Septuaginta (LXX), was followed  by independent histories relating to Biblical events. One of the best  known authors is the chronographer Demetrius, who lived in the second  half of the third century, and whose work Flavius Josephus is supposed  to have utilised. Not to speak of the Greek authors in Judaea and Syria,  we may mention Artapanos, who, following the fashion of the day, wrote  history in the form of a romance, and showed traces of an apologetic  character. He endeavoured to attribute all that was great in Egyptian  civilisation to Moses. This was due to the fact that Manetho, the  Egyptian historian, and others following his example, had spread fables  and venomous tales about the ancient sojourn and exodus of the Hebrews  and their leader. To counterbalance these accusations, fables had to  be interwoven into history, and history became romance. Moses was  thus identified with Hermes, and made out to be the father of Egyptian  wisdom. But, if the close acquaintanceship of Hebraism and Hellenism  began with a mere flirtation, encouraged by the rulers of the land and  kept up by the Jews, who wished to gain the favour of the conquering  race and to show themselves and their history in as favourable a light  as possible, it soon ended in a serious attachment. The Hebrews made  themselves acquainted with Hellenic life and thought. They studied Homer  and Hesiod, Empedocles and Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle, and they  were startled by the discovery that in Greek thought there were many  elements, moral and religious, familiar to them: this enhanced the  attraction. The narrowness and exclusiveness to which strict nationality  always gives rise, engendering contempt and hatred for everything  foreign--which made even the Greeks, with all their intellectual  culture, draw a line of demarcation between Greek and barbarian--gave  way to a spirit of cosmopolitan breadth of view which has only very  rarely been equalled in history. Hellenic and Hebrew forms of  thought were brought into friendly union, and gave birth to ideas  and aspirations of which humanity may always be proud. Greek aesthetic  judgment and Semitic mysticism, different phases of thought in  themselves, were welded into one. The religious conceptions of Moses  and the Prophets were expressed in the language of the philosophical  schools; an attempt was made to bring into harmony the dogmas of  supernatural revelation and the fruits of human speculative thought.  Such an attempt is a great undertaking, for, if sincerely and  relentlessly pursued, it must end in breaking down the barriers of  separation, in the establishment of a common truth, and in the sacrifice  of cherished ideals and convictions which prove to be wrong. If carried  to its logical conclusion, such a cosmopolitan broad-mindedness, such  a cross-fertilisation of intellectual products, must give rise to the  ennobling idea that there is only one truth, and that the external forms  are only fleeting waves upon the vast ocean of human ideals. The  attempt was made in Alexandria by the Judaeo-Hellenic philosophers.  Unfortunately, however, the Hebrews, with all their adaptability, have  not yet carried this attempt to its logical conclusion. The spirit  of reaction has ever and anon been ready to crush in its infancy the  endeavour of truth and sincerity, of broad-mindedness and tolerance.  When placed before the question to be or not to be, to be logical or  illogical, it has chosen the latter, and striven after the impossible:  the reconciliation of what cannot be reconciled without alterations,  rejections, and selections. The happy marriage of Hellenism and Hebraism  in Egypt had a tragic end. The union was dissolved, not, however,  without having produced its issue: the Alexandrian culture, which was  carried to Rome by Philo Judaeus, and thus influenced later European  thought and humanity at large.    [Illustration: 015.jpg PAGE IMAGE--Alexandria]          CHAPTER I--EGYPT CONQUERED BY THE GREEKS      _Alexander the Great.--Cleomenes.--B.C. 332-323_      The way for the Grecian conquest of Egypt had been preparing for many  years. Ever since the memorable march of Xenophon, who led, in the face  of unknown difficulties, ten thousand Greeks across Asia Minor, the  Greek statesman had suspected that the Hellenic soldier was capable of  undreamed possibilities.    When the young Alexander, succeeding his father Philip on the throne  of Macedonia, got himself appointed general by the chief of the Greek  states, and marched against Darius Codomanus, King of Persia, at the  head of the allied armies, it was not difficult to foresee the result.  The Greeks had learned the weakness of the Persians by having been so  often hired to fight for them. For a century past, every Persian army  had had a body of ten or twenty thousand Greeks in the van, and  without this guard the Persians were like a flock of sheep without the  shepherd's dog. Those countries which had trusted to Greek mercenaries  to defend them could hardly help falling when the Greek states united  for their conquest.    Alexander defeated the Persians under Darius in a great and memorable  battle near the town of Issus at the foot of the Taurus, at the pass  which divides Syria from Asia Minor, and then, instead of marching upon  Persia, he turned aside to the easier conquest of Egypt. On his way  there he spent seven months in the siege of the wealthy city of Tyre,  and he there punished with death every man capable of carrying arms, and  made slaves of the rest. He was then stopped for some time before the  little town of Gaza, where Batis, the brave governor, had the courage to  close the gates against the Greek army. His angry fretfulness at being  checked by so small a force was only equalled by his cruelty when he had  overcome it; he tied Batis by the heels to his chariot, and dragged him  round the walls of the city, as Achilles had dragged the body of Hector.    On the seventh day after leaving Gaza he reached Pelusium, the most  easterly town in Egypt, after a march of one hundred and seventy miles  along the coast of the Mediterranean, through a parched, glaring desert  which forms the natural boundary of the country; while the fleet kept  close to the shore to carry the stores for the army, as no fresh water  is to be met with on the line of march. The Egyptians did not even try  to hide their joy at his approach; they were bending very unwillingly  under the heavy "]]]
