To annihilate religious prejudices, it would be  sufficient to show that what is inconceivable to man can not be of any  use to him. Does it need, then, anything but simple common sense to  perceive that a being most clearly irreconcilable with the notions of  mankind, that a cause continually opposed to the effects attributed to  him; that a being of whom not a word can be said without falling into  contradictions; that a being who, far from explaining the mysteries of  the universe, only renders them more inexplicable; that a being to whom  for so many centuries men addressed themselves so vainly to obtain their  happiness and deliverance from their sufferings; does it need, I say,  more than simple common sense to understand that the idea of such a  being is an idea without model, and that he is himself evidently not a  reasonable being? Does it require more than common sense to feel that  there is at least delirium and frenzy in hating and tormenting each  other for unintelligible opinions of a being of this kind? Finally, does  it not all prove that morality and virtue are totally incompatible with  the idea of a God, whose ministers and interpreters have painted him in  all countries as the most fantastic, the most unjust, and the most cruel  of tyrants, whose pretended wishes are to serve as rules and laws for  the inhabitants of the earth? To discover the true principles of  morality, men have no need of theology, of revelation, or of Gods; they  need but common sense; they have only to look within themselves, to  reflect upon their own nature, to consult their obvious interests, to  consider the object of society and of each of the members who compose  it, and they will easily understand that virtue is an advantage, and  that vice is an injury to beings of their species. Let us teach men to  be just, benevolent, moderate, and sociable, not because their Gods  exact it, but to please men; let us tell them to abstain from vice and  from crime, not because they will be punished in another world, but  because they will suffer in the present world. There are, says  Montesquieu, means to prevent crime, they are sufferings; to change the  manners, these are good examples. Truth is simple, error is complicated,  uncertain in its gait, full of by-ways; the voice of nature is  intelligible, that of falsehood is ambiguous, enigmatical, and  mysterious; the road of truth is straight, that of imposture is oblique  and dark; this truth, always necessary to man, is felt by all just  minds; the lessons of reason are followed by all honest souls; men are  unhappy only because they are ignorant; they are ignorant only because  everything conspires to prevent them from being enlightened, and they  are wicked only because their reason is not sufficiently developed.          COMMON SENSE.    Detexit quo dolose Vaticinandi furore sacerdotes mysteria, illis spe  ignota, audactur publicant.--PETRON. SATYR.          I.--APOLOGUE.    There is a vast empire governed by a monarch, whose conduct does but  confound the minds of his subjects. He desires to be known, loved,  respected, and obeyed, but he never shows himself; everything tends to  make uncertain the notions which we are able to form about him. The  people subjected to his power have only such ideas of the character and  the laws of their invisible sovereign as his ministers give them; these  suit, however, because they themselves have no idea of their master, for  his ways are impenetrable, and his views and his qualities are totally  incomprehensible; moreover, his ministers disagree among themselves in  regard to the orders which they pretend emanated from the sovereign  whose organs they claim to be; they announce them diversely in each  province of the empire; they discredit and treat each other as impostors  and liars; the decrees and ordinances which they promulgate are obscure;  they are enigmas, made not to be understood or divined by the subjects  for whose instruction they were intended. The laws of the invisible  monarch need interpreters, but those who explain them are always  quarreling among themselves about the true way of understanding them;  more than this, they do not agree among themselves; all which they  relate of their hidden prince is but a tissue of contradictions,  scarcely a single word that is not contradicted at once. He is called  supremely good, nevertheless not a person but complains of his decrees.  He is supposed to be infinitely wise, and in his administration  everything seems contrary to reason and good sense. They boast of his  justice, and the best of his subjects are generally the least favored.  We are assured that he sees everything, yet his presence remedies  nothing. It is said that he is the friend of order, and everything in  his universe is in a state of confusion and disorder; all is created by  him, yet events rarely happen according to his projects. He foresees  everything, but his foresight prevents nothing. He is impatient if any  offend him; at the same time he puts every one in the way of offending  him. His knowledge is admired in the perfection of his works, but his  works are full of imperfections, and of little permanence. He is  continually occupied in creating and destroying, then repairing what he  has done, never appearing to be satisfied with his work. In all his  enterprises he seeks but his own glory, but he does not succeed in being  glorified. He works but for the good of his subjects, and most of them  lack the necessities of life. Those whom he seems to favor, are  generally those who are the least satisfied with their fate; we see them  all continually revolting against a master whose greatness they admire,  whose wisdom they extol, whose goodness they worship, and whose justice  they fear, revering orders which they never follow. This empire is the  world; its monarch is God; His ministers are the priests; their subjects  are men.          II.--WHAT IS THEOLOGY?    There is a science which has for its object only incomprehensible  things. Unlike all others, it occupies itself but with things unseen.  Hobbes calls it \"the kingdom of darkness.\" In this land all obey laws  opposed to those which men acknowledge in the world they inhabit. In  this marvelous region light is but darkness, evidence becomes doubtful  or false, the impossible becomes credible, reason is an unfaithful  guide, and common sense changed into delirium. This science is named  Theology, and this Theology is a continual insult to human reason.          III.    By frequent repetition of if, but, and perhaps, we succeed in forming an  imperfect and broken system which perplexes men's minds to the extent of  making them forget the clearest notions, and to render uncertain the  most palpable truths. By the aid of this systematic nonsense, all nature  has become an inexplicable enigma for man; the visible world has  disappeared to give place to invisible regions; reason is obliged to  give place to imagination, which can lead us only to the land of  chimeras which she herself has invented.          IV.--MAN BORN NEITHER RELIGIOUS NOR DEISTICAL.    All religious principles are founded upon the idea of a God, but it is  impossible for men to have true ideas of a being who does not act upon  any one of their senses. All our ideas are but pictures of objects which  strike us. What can the idea of God represent to us when it is evidently  an idea without an object? Is not such an idea as impossible as an  effect without a cause? An idea without a prototype, is it anything but  a chimera? Some theologians, however, assure us that the idea of God is  innate, or that men have this idea from the time of their birth. Every  principle is a judgment; all judgment is the effect of experience;  experience is not acquired but by the exercise of the senses: from which  it follows that religious principles are drawn from nothing, and are not  innate.          V.--IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BELIEVE IN A GOD, AND THE MOST REASONABLE  THING IS NOT TO THINK OF HIM.    No religious system can be founded otherwise than upon the nature of God  and of men, and upon the relations they bear to each other. But, in  order to judge of the reality of these relations, we must have some idea  of the Divine nature. But everybody tells us that the essence of God is  incomprehensible to man; at the same time they do not hesitate to assign  attributes to this incomprehensible God, and assure us that man can not  dispense with a knowledge of this God so impossible to conceive of. The  most important thing for men is that which is the most impossible for  them to comprehend. If God is incomprehensible to man, it would seem  rational never to think of Him at all; but religion concludes that man  is criminal if he ceases for a moment to revere Him.          VI.--RELIGION IS FOUNDED UPON CREDULITY.    We are told that Divine qualities are not of a nature to be grasped by  limited minds. The natural consequence of this principle ought to be  that the Divine qualities are not made to employ limited minds; but  religion assures us that limited minds should never lose sight of this  inconceivable being, whose qualities can not be grasped by them: from  which we see that religion is the art of occupying limited minds with  that which is impossible for them to comprehend.          VII.--EVERY RELIGION IS AN ABSURDITY.    Religion unites man with God or puts them in communication; but do you  say that God is infinite? If God is infinite, no finite being can have  communication or any relation with Him. Where there are no relations,  there can be no union, no correspondence, no duties. If there are no  duties between man and his God, there exists no religion for man. Thus  by saying that God is infinite, you annihilate, from that moment, all  religion for man, who is a finite being. The idea of infinity is for us  in idea without model, without prototype, without object.

Do you think it is a  mad scheme?\"    \"It would impress the natives,\" said Compton, \"and at any rate we  could start wheat-milling, you know, in case we came to the end of  our resources.\"    \"There's no wheat in Central Africa, you duffer! Besides, sir, it's  mainly a question of gear. With a lever, cog-wheels, and a running  chain after the pattern of the cycle chain, one could----\"    \"And ball bearings,\" suggested Compton, slyly.    \"Yes; and ball bearings--the friction would be reduced, and we could  get more power out of a screw and propeller than we could from four  paddles.\"    \"You may be right,\" said Mr. Hume, thoughtfully.    \"We don't want to take a large party, and I confess the water  transport has bothered me very much. The wind-mill, I am afraid, we  must leave to some other time, but the other part of your scheme is  worth placing before practical men, and I will give you a letter to  a friend of mine who had a boat built on the Thames.\"    Venning saw the friend the very next day; the friend gave him an  introduction to a member of a great firm of torpedo-boat builders on  the Thames, and this gentleman very kindly gave the matter five  minutes' attention.    \"Your idea, eh?\" said the great designer. \"Explain what advantage  you expect to gain.\"    \"Less labour in working than with paddles, and greater speed.\"    \"Humph! Well, my lad, you leave the matter with me, and I will  report. You can look over the yards if you like.\"    Venning spent the rest of the morning among the wicked-looking  sharks of the Navy, and he went back depressed with the thought that  his \"sneak-box\" was merely a plaything. However, he picked up  confidence when the next day brought an offer from the builders to  turn out an aluminium sneak-box in three divisions, with capacity  for a crew of six, to be worked on occasion by two men pulling at  levers, driving the propeller by means of endless chains and cog-  wheels, the gear to be made of best oil-tempered nickel-steel, with  hardened ball bearings. Each division, when detached, of such weight  that it could be easily carried by three men, but no guarantee given  that the propeller would give the speed desired.    \"That is good enough for us, I think,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"They give no guarantee,\" remarked Compton, cautiously.    \"No; but they would not undertake the work unless they had some  belief in the idea, and if the propeller proves useless, we can at  the worst unship it. In any case we must have the boat, and we could  not improve on the makers.\"    The order was given, and by the fourth week the little boat was  launched on the Thames for its first trial. It looked workmanlike in  spite of its wide beam and shallow draught, for the great designer  who had fashioned the lines of the fastest destroyer afloat had  himself drawn up the plans after giving a day's careful thought to  the job. The shaft, which rested on nickel-steel sockets, with ball  bearings supported by nickel-steel ribs for lightness, was protected  by a water-tight casing, and all the other parts made of the very  best metal, so as to secure both lightness and strength, with a  complicated set of cog-wheels to take off the strain. The steering  was by a neat wheel right forward, where the look-out man could have  an uninterrupted view. Forward, too, was the socket for the metal  mast. The boat was fifteen feet in length, with a beam of four feet  amidships, tapering fore and aft, with a well in the centre, and the  remaining space covered in with a light aluminium deck, strengthened  by oak bends. There was sleeping-room for two, so that with a crew  of four there would have to be four watches of three hours each. The  peculiar features of the long, low craft were the two levers rising  above the after-deck through slots, which gave each a thrust of  about one and a half feet, and two  saddle-like seats borne on stout  supports, one near the stem facing the bows, and the other further  forward facing the stem. Venning perched himself on one seat,  Compton on the other, one of the hands took the wheel, and Mr. Hume  and the designer sat in the well.    Compton's clear-cut face, with well-formed jaws, showed no other  sign of interest than a rather amused smile, but Venning's fair  features were flushed with excitement and nervous expectation, A man  pushed the boat out. It moved at first sluggishly.    \"Full speed ahead!\" cried out Mr. Hume.    Venning pulled his lever over, and as he shot it back Compton pulled  his, the two moving to and fro easily as if they had been rowing a  steady stroke.    \"She moves, she moves!\" cried Mr. Hume, with a shout.    \"Take her over the mile,\" said the designer to the steersman; and he  pulled out his watch with exactly the same look of calm interest he  showed when presiding over the trial of the fastest craft afloat.    The shining aluminium boat answered to her helm, slipped through the  muddy waters in a graceful curve, and then steadied for the straight  course.    \"Let her go, boys.\"    The levers worked to and fro with an easy swing; there rose the hum  of the chains moving easily below, and the quickened churning of the  propeller blades.    The designer glanced from his watch to the bank, which was fast  slipping away, and nodded his head at Mr. Hume.    \"Easy all. I think she will do;\" and he nodded at Venning. \"Ten  minutes.\"    \"Ten minutes!\"    \"A mile in ten minutes--six miles an hour!\"    \"And it was as easy as nothing,\" said Venning--\"wasn't it, Dick?\"    \"Like cutting bread,\" said Compton.    \"Very good, I think; but you must remember that she carries no  cargo. Now we'll try her with the sail alone, and then with the sail  and screw combined, and then with the screw and oars, for you will  see that I have fitted row-locks.\"    Under a fair breeze the boat skimmed along at a merry pace, with no  wave worth speaking of; and with the sail and screw she put on an  additional four miles, and with the oars an extra three, making from  nine to ten miles an hour.    \"I congratulate you, Mr. Venning,\" said the designer, as they  stepped out, thoroughly pleased.    \"I am sure, sir, we thank you,\" said the boy, warmly.    \"Eight,\" said Mr. Hume; \"and we are thoroughly pleased with the  craft, every one of us.\"    \"She is a beauty,\" put in Compton--\"a real beauty; and I think she  would be perfect if a light awning could be fixed up over the after-  deck.\"    \"That could be done easily.    \"It would be an improvement, certainly,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"I will rig up brackets to hold the rods for the awning.\"    \"And we could fix up mosquito curtains round the sides. That is A 1.  Now, what is her name to be?\" And Mr. Hume looked at Venning.    He had thought of a name, and was prompt with it--the Okapi.    \"And what does that mean?\" asked the builder, with a smile.    Venning explained, and the name was adopted.    \"Now,\" said the builder, \"if Mr. Venning will come down to-morrow  afternoon, my workmen will take the Okapi to pieces in his presence  before packing it for delivery in the docks, and explain thoroughly  how it is to be put together. I will give orders for several extra  plates with fittings to be placed in one of the divisions, so that  if you have an accident you will have the material for repairing the  mischief. You understand, aluminium cannot be soldered, but you  could cover a hole by means of nuts and screws.\"    Venning was in time next day to receive his instructions, and made  in his note-book an outline sketch of each part. While he was so  engaged, Mr. Hume, with Compton, were seeing the outfit packed for  the steamer, every purchase having been made with great judgment, so  that nothing superfluous figured in the list. Their armament  consisted of one double express for Mr. Hume, two sporting carbines  for the boys, three Mauser revolvers, and one fowling-piece, strong  hunting-knives, as well as four Ghoorka knives for cutting a path  through the forest. As far as possible all their food-stuff was  concentrated in tabloids and essences; each had his own special tin-  lined  medicine-case, in addition to the common drug-chest; each  his own water-bottle of double canvas, a material which, permitting  evaporation, keeps the water cool; and each his regulation \"billy,\"  or cooking-tin. As for clothing, it was a mixture of luxury and  rough wear, of the best silk underwear, cellular shirts of a light  blue, and yellow chamois-skin breeches, warranted to grow tougher  with use. Putties were discarded, as likely to give harbourage to  \"jiggers,\" which bore into the toes, in favour of soft leather high  boots, tightly fastened at the knee; and the outfit included needles  for the making of moccasins, or  veld schoen, from the hides of the  larger antelope.    \"Why do you select all blue shirts, Mr. Hume?\" asked Venning.    \"On account of the mosquitoes.\"    \"Consider the feeling of the gorillas,\" said Compton, dryly.  \"Perhaps they would prefer green.\"    \"They may find us green enough for their taste, Compton; but I am  not joking. Mosquitoes have a preference for some colours and an  aversion for others. They dislike blue most of all, so you see I  have a purpose in selecting blue--not only for the shirts, but for  the mosquito curtains.\"    \"All these precautions for a wretched fly.\"    \"Exactly. A mosquito's gimlet carries more terrors for the explorer  than the elephant's trunk, and his hum is more dreaded than the roar  of the lion. The mosquito is fever-winged, alert, and bloodthirsty.  He carries the germs of malaria with him; and malaria kills off more  men than all the reptiles and wild animals combined.\"    \"Is there no way of fighting?\" asked Compton, impressed.    \"Oh ay; they are fighting him on the West Coast by draining the  swamps, where he breeds about the villages. But who can drain the  swamps of the Congo, or let light into the Great Forest?\"    \"Then we"]]]
