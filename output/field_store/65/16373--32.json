This brings the central point around which both worlds  swing just inside the surface of the earth. It is like an apple  attached by a string, and swung around the hand; the hand moves  a little, the apple very much.    Thus the problem of two revolving bodies is readily comprehended.  The two bodies lie in easy beds, and swing obedient to constant  forces. When another body, however, is introduced, with its varying  attraction, first on one and then on the other, complications are  introduced that only the most masterly minds can follow. Introduce  a dozen or a million bodies, and complications arise that only  Omniscience can unravel.    [Page 10]  [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    Let the hand swing an apple by an elastic cord. When the apple  falls toward the earth it feels another force besides that derived  from the hand, which greatly lengthens the elastic cord. To tear  it away from the earth's attraction, and make it rise, requires  additional force, and hence the string is lengthened; but when  it passes over the hand the earth attracts it downward, and the  string is very much shortened: so the moon, held by an elastic cord,  swings around the earth. From its extreme distance from the earth,  at A, Fig. 2, it rushes with increasing speed nearly a quarter of a  million of miles toward the sun, feeling its attraction increase  with every mile until it reaches B; then it is retarded in its  speed, by the same attraction, as it climbs back its quarter of  a million of miles away from the sun, in defiance of its power,  to C. All the while the invisible elastic force of the earth is  unweariedly maintained; and though the moon's distances vary over a  range of 31,355 miles, the moon is always in a determinable place.  A simple revolution of one world about another in a circular orbit  would be a problem of easy solution. It would always be at the  same distance from its centre, and going with the same velocity.  But there are over sixty causes that interfere with such a simple  orbit in the case of the moon, all of which causes and their  disturbances must be considered in calculating such a simple matter  as an eclipse, or predicting the moon's place as the sailors guide.  One of the most puzzling of the irregularities [Page 11] of our  night-wandering orb has just been explained by Professor Hansen, of  Gotha, as a curious result of the attraction of Venus.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Changes of orbit by mutual attraction.]    Take a single instance of the perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn  which can be rendered evident. The times of orbital revolution of  Saturn and Jupiter are nearly as five to two. Suppose the orbits of  the planets to be, as in Fig. 3, both ellipses, but not necessarily  equally distant in all parts. The planets are as near as possible  at 1, 1. Drawn toward each other by mutual attraction, Jupiter's  orbit bends outward, and Saturn's becomes more nearly straight, as  shown by the dotted lines. A partial correction of this difficulty  immediately follows. As Jupiter moves on ahead of Saturn it is held  back--retarded in its orbit by that body; and Saturn is hastened  in its orbit by the attraction of Jupiter. Now greater speed means  a straighter orbit. A rifle-ball flies nearer in a straight line  than a thrown stone. A greater velocity given to a whirled ball  pulls the elastic cord far enough to give the ball a larger orbit.  Hence, being hastened, Saturn stretches out nearer its proper orbit,  and, retarded, Jupiter approaches the smaller curve that is its  true orbit.    But if they were always to meet at this point, as they would if  Jupiter made two revolutions to Saturn's one, it would be disastrous.  In reality, when Saturn has gone around two-thirds of its orbit to  2, Jupiter will have gone once and two-thirds around and overtaken  [Page 12] Saturn; and they will be near again, be drawn together,  hastened, and retarded, as before; their next conjunction would be  at 3, 3, etc.    Now, if they always made their conjunction at points equally distant,  or at thirds of their orbits, it would cause a series of increasing  deviations; for Jupiter would be constantly swelling his orbit at  three points, and Saturn increasingly contracting his orbit at  the same points. Disaster would be easily foretold. But as their  times of orbital revolutions are not exactly in the ratio of five  and two, their points of conjunction slowly travel around the orbit,  till, in a period of nine hundred years, the starting-point is  again reached, and the perturbations have mutually corrected one  another.    For example, the total attractive effect of one planet on the other  for 450 years is to quicken its speed. The effect for the next 450  years is to retard. The place of Saturn, when all the retardations  have accumulated for 450 years, is one degree behind what it is  computed if they are not considered; and 450 years later it will  be one degree before its computed place--a perturbation of two  degrees. When a bullet is a little heavier or ragged on one side,  it will constantly swerve in that direction. The spiral groove in  the rifle, of one turn in forty-five feet, turns the disturbing  weight or raggedness from side to side--makes one error correct  another, and so the ball flies straight to the bull's-eye. So the  place of Jupiter and Saturn, though further complicated by four  moons in the case of Jupiter, and eight in the case of Saturn, and  also by perturbations caused by other planets, can be calculated  with exceeding nicety.    The difficulties would be greatly increased if the orbits [Page 13]  of Saturn and Jupiter, instead of being 400,000,000 miles apart,  were interlaced. Yet there are the orbits of one hundred and  ninety-two asteroids so interlaced that, if they were made of wire,  no one could be lifted without raising the whole net-work of them.  Nevertheless, all these swift chariots of the sky race along the  course of their intermingling tracks as securely as if they were  each guided by an intelligent mind. _They are guided by an  intelligent mind and an almighty arm._    Still more complicated is the question of the mutual attractions of  all the planets. Lagrange has been able to show, by a mathematical  genius that seems little short of omniscience in his single department  of knowledge, that there is a discovered system of oscillations,  affecting the entire planetary system, the periods of which are  immensely long. The number of these oscillations is equal to that  of all the planets, and their periods range from 50,000 to 2,000,000  years,    Looking into the open page of the starry heavens we see double  stars, the constituent parts of which must revolve around a centre  common to them both, or rush to a common ruin. Eagerly we look  to see if they revolve, and beholding them in the very act, we  conclude, not groundlessly, that the same great law of gravitation  holds good in distant stellar spaces, and that there the same sufficient  mind plans, and the same sufficient power directs and controls all  movements in harmony and security.    When we come to the perturbations caused by the mutual attractions  of the sun, nine planets, twenty moons, one hundred and ninety-two  asteroids, millions [Page 14] of comets, and innumerable meteoric  bodies swarming in space, and when we add to all these, that belong  to one solar system, the attractions of all the systems of the other  suns that sparkle on a brilliant winter night, we are compelled to  say, \"As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high above our  thoughts and ways must be the thoughts and ways of Him who  comprehends and directs them all.\"          [Page 15]  II.    CREATIVE PROGRESS.      \"And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\"--_Genesis_    i., 3.      \"God is light.\"--1 _John_, i. 5.    [Page 16]    \"Hail! holy light, offspring of Heaven first born,    Or of the eternal, co-eternal beam,    May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,    And never but in unapproached light    Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,    Bright effluence of bright essence increate.\"      MILTON.      \"A million torches lighted by Thy hand    Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:    They own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,    All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.    What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light--    A glorious company of golden streams--    Lamps of celestial ether burning bright--    Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?    But 'Thou to these art as the noon to night.\"      DERZHAVIN, trans. by BOWRING.          [Page 17]  II.    _CREATIVE PROGRESS._    Worlds would be very imperfect and useless when simply endowed  with attraction and inertia, if no time were allowed for these  forces to work out their legitimate results. We want something  more than swirling seas of attracted gases, something more than  compacted rocks. We look for soil, verdure, a paradise of beauty,  animal life, and immortal minds. Let us go on with the process.    Light is the child of force, and the child, like its father, is full  of power. We dowered our created world with but a single quality--a  force of attraction. It not only had attraction for its own material  substance, but sent out an all-pervasive attraction into space. By  the force of condensation it flamed like a sun, and not only lighted  its own substance, but it filled all space with the luminous outgoings  of its power. A world may be limited, but its influence cannot;  its body may have bounds, but its soul is infinite. Everywhere is  its manifestation as real, power as effective, presence as actual,  as at the central point. He that studies ponderable bodies alone  is not studying the universe, only its skeleton.

Verdigris dissolves in  turpentine, and successful attempts might be made to make a green  japan varnish from it on the lines indicated for rosinate of copper.      ORANGE-COLOURED GROUNDS.    Orange-coloured grounds may be formed by mixing vermilion or red lead  with King's yellow, or orange lake or red orpiment (? realgar) will  make a brighter orange ground than can be produced by any mixture.      PURPLE GROUNDS.    Purple grounds may be produced by the admixture of lake or vermilion  with Prussian blue. They may be treated as the other coloured grounds  as regards the varnish vehicle.      BLACK GROUNDS.    Black grounds may be formed either from lamp black or ivory black, but  ivory black is preferable to lamp black, and possibly carbon black or  gas black to either. These may be always applied with the shellac  varnish as a vehicle, and their upper or polishing coats may consist  of common seed-lac varnish. But the best quality of ivory black ground  in the best super black japan yields, after suitable stoving, a very  excellent black indeed, the purity of tone of which may be improved by  adding a little blue in the grinding.      COMMON BLACK JAPAN GROUNDS ON METAL.    Common black japan grounds on metal by means of heat are procured in  the following manner: The surface to be japanned must be coated over  with drying oil, and when it is moderately dry must be put into a  stove of such heat as will change the oil black without burning it.  The stove should not be too hot when the oil is put into it nor the  heat increased too fast, either which error would make it blister, but  the slower the heat is increased and the longer it is continued,  provided it be restrained within a due degree, the harder will be the  coat of japan. This kind of japan requires no polish, having received  from the heat, when properly regulated, a sufficiently bright surface.      TORTOISE-SHELL GROUND.    This beautiful ground, produced by heat, is valued not only for its  hardness and its capacity to stand a heat greater than that of boiling  water, but also for its fine appearance. It is made by means of a  varnish prepared thus: Take one gallon of good linseed oil and half a  pound of umber, boil them together until the oil becomes very brown  and thick, strain it then through a coarse cloth and set it again to  boil, in which state it must be continued until it acquires a  consistency resembling that of pitch; it will then be fit for use.  Having thus prepared the varnish, clean well the surface which is to  be japanned; then apply vermilion ground in shellac varnish or with  drying oil, very thinly diluted with oil of turpentine, on the places  intended to imitate the more transparent parts of the tortoise-shell.  When the vermilion is dry, brush the whole over with the black varnish  thinned to the right consistency with oil of turpentine. When set and  firm put the work into a stove where it may undergo a very strong  heat, which must be continued a considerable time, for three weeks or  even a month so much the better. This ground may be decorated with  painting and gilding in the same way as any other varnished surface,  which had best be done after the ground has been hardened, but it is  well to give a second annealing at a very gentle heat after it has  been finished. A very good black japan may be made by mixing a little  japan gold size with ivory or lamp-black, this will develop a good  gloss without requiring to be varnished afterwards.      PAINTING JAPAN WORK.    Japan work should be painted with real \"enamel paints,\" that is with  paints actually ground in varnish, and in that case all pigments may  be used and the peculiar disadvantages, which attend several pigments  with respect to oil or water, cease with this class of vehicle, for  they are secured by it when properly handled from the least danger of  changing or fading. The preparation of pigments for this purpose  consists in bringing them to a due state of fineness by grinding them  on a stone with turpentine. The best varnish for binding and  preserving the pigments is shellac. This, when judiciously handled,  gives such a firmness and hardness to the work that, if it be  afterwards further secured with a moderately thick coat of seed-lac  varnish, it will be almost as hard and durable as glass. The method of  painting in varnish is, however, far more tedious than with an oil or  water vehicle. It is, therefore, now very usual in japan work for the  sake of dispatch, and in some cases in order to be able to use the  pencil (brush) more freely, to apply the colours in an oil vehicle  well diluted with turps. This oil (or japanners' gold size) may be  made thus: Take 1 lb. of linseed oil and 4 oz. of gum anime, set the  oil in a proper vessel and then add the gum anime powder, stirring it  well until the whole is mixed with the oil. Let the mixture continue  to boil until it appears of a thick consistence, then strain the whole  through a coarse cloth and keep it for use. The pigments are also  sometimes applied in a gum-water vehicle, but work so done, it has  been urged, is not nearly so durable as that done in varnish or oil.  However, those who formerly condemned the practice of japanning  water-coloured decorations allowed that amateurs, who practised  japanning for their amusement only and thus might not find it  convenient to stock the necessary preparations for the other methods,  might paint with water-colours. If the pigments are ground in an  aqueous vehicle of strong isinglass size and honey instead of gum  water the work would not be much inferior to that executed with other  vehicles. Water-colours are sometimes applied on a ground of gold  after the style of other paintings, and sometimes so as to produce an  embossed effect. The pigments in this style of painting are ground in  a vehicle of isinglass size corrected with honey or sugar-candy. The  body with which the embossed work is raised is best formed of strong  gum water thickened to a proper consistency with armenian bole and  whiting in equal parts, which, being laid on in the proper figures and  repaired when dry, may be then painted with the intended pigments in  the vehicle of isinglass size or in the general manner with shellac  varnish. As to the comparative value of pigments ground in water and  ground in oil, that is between oil-colours and water-colours in  enamelling and japanning, there seems to have been a change of opinion  for some time back, especially as regards the enamelling of slate. The  marbling of slate (to be enamelled) in water-colours is a process  which Mr. Dickson says well repays study. It is greatly developed in  France and Germany. The process is a quick one and the pigments are  said to stand well and to maintain their pristine hue, yet if many  strikingly natural effects result from the use of this process, its  use has not spread in Great Britain, being confined wholly and solely  to the marbling of slate (except in the case of wall-paper which is  water-marbled in a somewhat similar way).    \"In painting in oil-colour,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"the craftsman trusts  largely to his badger-hair brush to produce his effects of softness  and marbly appearance; but in painting in water-colours, this  softness, depth, and marbly appearance are produced mostly by the  colour placed upon the surface, and left entirely untouched by badger  or any other brush. The colour drying quickly, does not allow much  time for working, and when dry it cannot be touched without spoiling  the whole of the work. The difference first of all between painting in  water and in oil colour, is that a peculiar grain exists with painting  in water that it is absolutely impossible to get in oil. The charm of  a marble is, I think, its translucency as much as its beautiful  colour; it is to that translucency (for in marble fixed we have no  transparency) that it owes its softness of effect, which makes marble  of such decorative value. This translucency can only be obtained by  thin glazes of colour, by which means each succeeding glaze only  partly covers the previous one, the character of the marble being thus  produced. This is done sometimes in oil-colour in a marvellous manner,  but even the best of oil-painting in marble cannot stand the  comparison of water-colour, and it is only by comparison that any  accurate judgment can be formed of any work. The production of marbles  in water-colour has a depth, softness, and stoniness that defies  oil-painting, and in some cases will defy detection unless by an  expert of marbles. It may be that first of all the materials employed  are more in keeping with the real material, as no oil enters into the  composition of real marble, and by using the medium of water we thus  start better, but the real secret is that by using water as a medium  the colours take an entirely different effect. In painting in  water-colour greys of any tint or strength can be obtained suitable  for the production of a marble of greyish ground, by pure white,  tinted as required, being applied of different thicknesses of colour,  all the modulations of tone being obtained by the difference in the  thickness of the colour applied.\"      VARNISHING JAPAN WORK.    Varnishing is the last and the finishing process in japanning. It  consists in (1) applying, and (2) polishing the outer coats of  varnish, which are equally necessary whether the plain japan ground be  painted on or not. This is best done in a general way with common  seed-lac varnish, except on those occasions where other methods have  been shown to be more expedient, and the same reasons, which decide as  to the propriety of using the different varnishes as regards the  colours of the ground, hold equally with those of the painting, for  where brightness is a material point and a tinge of yellow would  injure it, seed-lac must"]]]
