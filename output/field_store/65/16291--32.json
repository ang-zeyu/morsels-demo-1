Napoleon is said to have named it and to have kissed the waitress who  first served it to him in the tiny town of Camembert. And there a  statue stands today in the market place to honor Marie Harel who made  the first Camembert.    Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple, pineapple, pear,  French \"flute\" or pumpernickel. As-with Brie and with oysters,  Camembert should be eaten only in the \"R\" months, and of these  September is the best.    Since Camembert rhymes with beware, if you can't get the _veritable_  don't fall for a domestic imitation or any West German abomination  such as one dressed like a valentine in a heart-shaped box and labeled  \"Camembert--Cheese Exquisite.\" They are equally tasteless, chalky with  youth, or choking with ammoniacal gas when old and decrepit.    Cheddar    The English _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_ says:         Cheddar cheese is one of the kings of cheese; it is pale coloured,       mellow, salvy, and, when good, resembling a hazelnut in flavour.       The Cheddar principle pervades the whole cheesemaking districts       of America, Canada and New Zealand, but no cheese imported into       England can equal the Cheddars of Somerset and the West of       Scotland.    Named for a village near Bristol where farmer Joseph Harding first  manufactured it, the best is still called Farmhouse Cheddar, but in  America we have practically none of this. Farmhouse Cheddar must be  ripened at least nine months to a mellowness, and little of our  American cheese gets as much as that. Back in 1695 John Houghton wrote  that it \"contended in goodness (if kept from two to five years,  according to magnitude) with any cheese in England.\"    Today it is called \"England's second-best cheese,\" second after  Stilton, of course.    In early days a large cheese sufficed for a year or two of family  feeding, according to this old note: \"A big Cheddar can be kept for  two years in excellent condition if kept in a cool room and turned  over every other day.\"    But in old England some were harder to preserve: \"In Bath... I asked  one lady of the larder how she kept Cheddar cheese. Her eyes twinkled:  'We don't keep cheese; we eats it.'\"    Cheshire    A Cheshireman sailed into Spain  To trade for merchandise;  When he arrived from the main  A Spaniard him espies.  Who said, \"You English rogue, look here!  What fruits and spices fine  Our land produces twice a year.  Thou has not such in thine.\"    The Cheshireman ran to his hold  And fetched a Cheshire cheese,  And said, \"Look here, you dog, behold!  We have such fruits as these.  Your fruits are ripe but twice a year,  As you yourself do say,  But such as I present you here  Our land brings twice a day.\"    Anonymous         Let us pass on to cheese. We have some glorious cheeses, and far       too few people glorying in them. The Cheddar of the inn, of the       chophouse, of the average English home, is a libel on a thing       which, when authentic, is worthy of great honor. Cheshire,       divinely commanded into existence as to three parts to precede       and as to one part to accompany certain Tawny Ports and some       Late-Bottled Ports, can be a thing for which the British Navy       ought to fire a salute on the principle on which Colonel Brisson       made his regiment salute when passing the great Burgundian       vineyard.         T. Earle Welby,         IN \"THE DINNER KNELL\"    Cheshire is not only the most literary cheese in England, but the  oldest. It was already manufactured when Caesar conquered Britain, and  tradition is that the Romans built the walled city of Chester to  control the district where the precious cheese was made. Chester on  the River Dee was a stronghold against the Roman invasion.    It came to fame with The Old Cheshire Cheese in Elizabethan times and  waxed great with Samuel Johnson presiding at the Fleet Street Inn  where White Cheshire was served \"with radishes or watercress or celery  when in season,\" and Red Cheshire was served toasted or stewed in a  sort of Welsh Rabbit. (_See_ Chapter 5.)    The Blue variety is called Cheshire-Stilton, and Vyvyan Holland, in  _Cheddar Gorge_ suggests that \"it was no doubt a cheese of this sort,  discovered and filched from the larder of the Queen of Hearts, that  accounted for the contented grin on the face of the Cheshire Cat in  Alice in Wonderland.\"    All very English, as recorded in Victor Meusy's couplet:        _Dans le Chester sec et rose      A longues dents, l'Anglais mord._        In the Chester dry and pink      The long teeth of the English sink.    Edam and Gouda       _Edam in Peace and War_    There also coming into the river two Dutchmen, we sent a couple of men  on board and brought three Holland cheeses, cost 4d. a piece,  excellent cheeses.    Pepys' _Diary_, March 2,1663         Commodore Coe, of the Montevidian Navy, defeated Admiral Brown of       the Buenos Ayrean Navy, in a naval battle, when he used Holland       cheese for cannon balls.         _The Harbinger_ (Vermont), December 11, 1847    The crimson cannon balls of Holland have been heard around the world.  Known as \"red balls\" in England and _katzenkopf,_ \"cat's head,\" in  Germany, they differ from Gouda chiefly in the shape, Gouda being  round but flattish and now chiefly imported as one-pound Baby Goudas.    Edam when it is good is very, very good, but when it is bad it is  horrid. Sophisticated ones are sent over already scalloped for the  ultimate consumer to add port, and there are crocks of Holland cheese  potted with sauterne. Both Edam and Gouda should be well aged to  develop full-bodied quality, two years being the accepted standard for  Edam.    The best Edams result from a perfect combination of Breed  (black-and-white Dutch Friesian) and Feed (the rich pasturage of  Friesland and Noord Holland).    The Goudas, shaped like English Derby and Belgian Delft and Leyden,  come from South Holland. Some are specially made for the Jewish trade  and called Kosher Gouda. Both Edam and Gouda are eaten at mealtimes  thrice daily in Holland. A Dutch breakfast without one or the other on  black bread with butter and black coffee would be unthinkable. They're  also boon companions to plum bread and Dutch cocoa.    \"Eclair Edams\" are those with soft insides.    Emmentaler, Gruyere and Swiss        When the working woman      Takes her midday lunch,      It is a piece of Gruyere      Which for her takes the place of roast.    Victor Meusy    Whether an Emmentaler is eminently Schweizerkaese, grand Gruyere from  France, or lesser Swiss of the United States, the shape, size and  glisten of the eyes indicate the stage of ripeness, skill of making  and quality of flavor. They must be uniform, roundish, about the size  of a big cherry and, most important of all, must glisten like the eye  of a lass in love, dry but with the suggestion of a tear.    Gruyere does not see eye to eye with the big-holed Swiss Saanen  cartwheel or American imitation. It has tiny holes, and many of them;  let us say it is freckled with pinholes, rather than pock-marked. This  variety is technically called a _niszler_, while one without any holes  at all is \"blind.\" Eyes or holes are also called vesicles.    Gruyere Trauben (Grape Gruyere) is aged in Neuchatel wine in  Switzerland, although most Gruyere has been made in France since its  introduction there in 1722. The most famous is made in the Jura, and  another is called Comte from its origin in Franche-Comte.    A blind Emmentaler was made in Switzerland for export to Italy where  it was hardened in caves to become a grating cheese called Raper, and  now it is largely imitated there. Emmentaler, in fact, because of its  piquant pecan-nut flavor and inimitable quality, is simulated  everywhere, even in Switzerland.    Besides phonies from Argentina and countries as far off as Finland, we  get a flood of imported and domestic Swisses of all sad sorts, with  all possible faults--from too many holes, that make a flabby, wobbly  cheese, to too few--cracked, dried-up, collapsed or utterly ruined by  molding inside. So it will pay you to buy only the kind already marked  genuine in Switzerland. For there cheese such as Saanen takes six  years to ripen, improves with age, and keeps forever.    Cartwheels well over a hundred years old are still kept in cheese  cellars (as common in Switzerland as wine cellars are in France), and  it is said that the rank of a family is determined by the age and  quality of the cheese in its larder.      Feta and Casere    The Greeks have a name for it--Feta. Their neighbors call it Greek  cheese. Feta is to cheese what Hymettus is to honey. The two together  make ambrosial manna. Feta is soft and as blinding white as a plate of  fresh Ricotta smothered with sour cream. The whiteness is preserved by  shipping the cheese all the way from Greece in kegs sloshing full of  milk, the milk being renewed from time to time. Having been cured in  brine, this great sheep-milk curd is slightly salty and somewhat  sharp, but superbly spicy.    When first we tasted it fresh from the keg with salty milk dripping  through our fingers, we gave it full marks. This was at the Staikos  Brothers Greek-import store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. We then  compared Feta with thin wisps of its grown-up brother, Casere. This  gray and greasy, hard and brittle palate-tickler of sheep's milk made  us bleat for more Feta.      Gorgonzola    Gorgonzola, least pretentious of the Blues triumvirate (including  Roquefort and Stilton) is nonetheless by common consent monarch of all  other Blues from Argentina to Denmark. In England, indeed, many  epicures consider Gorgonzola greater than Stilton, which is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14297"],[0,"The Congo and Coasts of Africa (#3)"],[1,"ne-quarter of the common  stock, and good Queen Anne reserved another quarter, which later she  divided among her ladies. But for a time she and her cousin of Spain  were the two largest slave merchants in the world. The point of view  of those then engaged in the slave trade is very interesting. When  Queen Elizabeth sent Admiral Hawkins slave-hunting, she presented  him with a ship, named, with startling lack of moral perception,  after the Man of Sorrows. In a book on the slave trade I picked up  at Sierra Leone there is the diary of an officer who accompanied  Hawkins. \"After,\" he writes, \"going every day on shore to take the  inhabitants by burning and despoiling of their towns,\" the ship was  becalmed. \"But,\" he adds gratefully, \"the Almighty God, who never  suffereth his elect to perish, sent us the breeze.\"    The slave book shows that as late as 1780 others of the \"elect\" of  our own South were publishing advertisements like this, which is one  of the shortest and mildest. It is from a Virginia newspaper: \"The  said fellow is outlawed, and I will give ten pounds reward for his  head severed from his body, or forty shillings if brought alive.\"    At about this same time an English captain threw overboard, chained  together, one hundred and thirty sick slaves. He claimed that had he  not done so the ship's company would have also sickened and died,  and the ship would have been lost, and that, therefore, the  insurance companies should pay for the slaves. The jury agreed with  him, and the Solicitor-General said: \"What is all this declamation  about human beings! This is a case of chattels or goods. It is  really so--it is the case of throwing over goods. For the  purpose--the purpose of the insurance, they are goods and property;  whether right or wrong, we have nothing to do with it.\" In 1807  England declared the slave trade illegal. A year later the United  States followed suit, but although on the seas her frigates chased  the slavers, on shore a part of our people continued to hold slaves,  until the Civil War rescued both them and the slaves.    As early as 1718 Raynal and Diderot estimated that up to that time  there had been exported from Africa to the North and South Americas  nine million slaves. Our own historian, Bancroft, calculated that in  the eighteenth century the English alone imported to the Americas  three million slaves, while another 2,500,000 purchased or kidnapped  on the West Coast were lost in the surf, or on the voyage thrown  into the sea. For that number Bancroft places the gross returns as  not far from four hundred millions of dollars.    All this is history, and to the reader familiar, but I do not  apologize for reviewing it here, as without the background of the  slave trade, the West Coast, as it is to-day, is difficult to  understand. As we have seen, to kings, to chartered \"Merchant  Adventurers,\" to the cotton planters of the West Indies and of our  South, and to the men of the North who traded in black ivory, the  West Coast gave vast fortunes. The price was the lives of millions  of slaves. And to-day it almost seems as though the sins of the  fathers were being visited upon the children; as though the juju of  the African, under the spell of which his enemies languish and die,  has been cast upon the white man. We have to look only at home. In  the millions of dead, and in the misery of the Civil War, and  to-day in race hatred, in race riots, in monstrous crimes and as  monstrous lynchings, we seem to see the fetish of the West Coast,  the curse, falling upon the children to the third and fourth  generation of the million slaves that were thrown, shackled, into  the sea.    The first mention in history of Sierra Leone is when in 480 B.C.,  Hanno, the Carthaginian, anchored at night in its harbor, and then  owing to \"fires in the forests, the beating of drums, and strange  cries that issued from the bushes,\" before daylight hastened away.  We now skip nineteen hundred years. This is something of a gap, but  except for the sketchy description given us by Hanno of the place,  and his one gaudy night there, Sierra Leone until the fifteenth  century utterly disappears from the knowledge of man. Happy is the  country without a history!    Nineteen hundred years having now supposed to elapse, the second act  begins with De Cintra, who came in search of slaves, and instead  gave the place its name. Because of the roaring of the wind around  the peak that rises over the harbor he called it the Lion Mountain.    After the fifteenth century, in a succession of failures, five  different companies of \"Royal Adventurers\" were chartered to trade  with her people, and, when convenient, to kidnap them; pirates in  turn kidnapped the British governor, the French and Dutch were  always at war with the settlement, and native raids, epidemics, and  fevers were continuous. The history of Sierra Leone is the history  of every other colony along the West Coast, with the difference that  it became a colony by purchase, and was not, as were the others, a  trading station gradually converted into a colony. During the war in  America, Great Britain offered freedom to all slaves that would  fight for her, and, after the war, these freed slaves were conveyed  on ships of war to London, where they were soon destitute. They  appealed to the great friend of the slave in those days, Granville  Sharp, and he with others shipped them to Sierra Leone, to  establish, with the aid of some white emigrants, an independent  colony, which was to be a refuge and sanctuary for others like  themselves. Liberia, which was the gift of philanthropists of  Baltimore to American freed slaves, was, no doubt, inspired by this  earlier effort. The colony became a refuge for slaves from every  part of the Coast, the West Indies and Nova Scotia, and to-day in  that one colony there are spoken sixty different coast dialects and  those of the hinterland.    Sierra Leone, as originally purchased in 1786, consisted of twenty  square miles, for which among other articles of equal value King  Naimbanna received a \"crimson satin embroidered waistcoat, one  puncheon of rum, ten pounds of beads, two cheeses, one box of  smoking pipes, a mock diamond ring, and a tierce of pork.\"    What first impressed me about Sierra Leone was the heat. It does not  permit one to give his attention wholly to anything else. I always  have maintained that the hottest place on earth is New York, and I  have been in other places with more than a local reputation for  heat; some along the Equator, Lourenco Marquez, which is only  prevented from being an earthen oven because it is a swamp; the Red  Sea, with a following breeze, and from both shores the baked heat of  the desert, and Nagasaki, on a rainy day in midsummer.    But New York in August radiating stored-up heat from iron-framed  buildings, with the foul, dead air shut in by the skyscrapers, with  a humidity that makes you think you are breathing through a  steam-heated sponge, is as near the lower regions as I hope any of  us will go. And yet Sierra Leone is no mean competitor.    We climbed the moss-covered steps to the quay to face a great white  building that blazed like the base of a whitewashed stove at white  heat. Before it were some rusty cannon and a canoe cut out of a  single tree, and, seated upon it selling fruit and sun-dried fish,  some native women, naked to the waist, their bodies streaming with  palm oil and sweat. At the same moment something struck me a blow on  the top of the head, at the base of the spine and between the  shoulder blades, and the ebony ladies and the white \"factory\" were  burnt up in a scroll of flame.     [Illustration: A White Building, that Blazed Like the Base of a   Whitewashed Stove at White Heat.]    I heard myself in a far-away voice asking where one could buy a sun  helmet and a white umbrella, and until I was under their protection,  Sierra Leone interested me no more.    One sees more different kinds of black people in Sierra Leone than  in any other port along the Coast; Senegalese and Senegambians,  Kroo boys, Liberians, naked bush boys bearing great burdens from the  forests, domestic slaves in fez and colored linen livery, carrying  hammocks swung from under a canopy, the local electric hansom,  soldiers of the W.A.F.F., the West African Frontier Force, in Zouave  uniform of scarlet and khaki, with bare legs; Arabs from as far in  the interior as Timbuctu, yellow in face and in long silken robes;  big fat \"mammies\" in well-washed linen like the washerwomen of  Jamaica, each balancing on her head her tightly rolled umbrella, and  in the gardens slim young girls, with only a strip of blue and white  linen from the waist to the knees, lithe, erect, with glistening  teeth and eyes, and their sisters, after two years in the mission  schools, demurely and correctly dressed like British school marms.  Sierra Leone has all the hall marks of the crown colony of the  tropics; good wharfs, clean streets, innumerable churches, public  schools operated by the government as well as many others run by  American and English missions, a club where the white \"mammies,\" as  all women are called, and the white officers--for Sierra Leone is a  coaling station on the Cape route to India, and is garrisoned  accordingly--play croquet, and bowl into a net.    When the officers are not bowling they are tramping into the  hinterland after tribes on the warpath from Liberia, and coming  back, perhaps wounded or racked with fever, or perhaps they do not  come back. On the day we landed they had just buried one of the  officers. On Saturday afternoon he had been playing tennis, during  the night the fever claimed him, and Sunday night he was dead.    That night as we pulled out to the steamer there came toward us in  black silhouette against the sun, setting blood-red into the lagoon,  two great canoes. They were coming from up the river piled high with  fruit"]]]
