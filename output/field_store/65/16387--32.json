We arrived at Lamington at  half past twelve, a trifle late for dinner, rather tired and hungry, but  with a glowing and I fear somewhat exaggerated account of our adventure  for the credulous ears of the rest of the boys.      ORGANIZING THE SOCIETY.    The camping idea met with the hearty approval of all, and it was decided  to begin preparations at once for the following summer. Dutchy, whose  father was a member of a geographical society, suggested that we form a  society for the exploration of Willow Clump Island. By general  acclamation Bill was chosen president of the society, Dutchy was made  vice-president, Reddy was elected treasurer, and they made me secretary.  It was Dutchy who proposed the name \"The Society for the Scientific  Investigation, Exploration and Exploitation of Willow Clump Island.\" It  was decided to make an expedition of exploration as soon as we could  make skate sails for the whole society.          CHAPTER II.    SKATE SAILS.      The duties of the secretary, as defined in the constitution which Dutchy  Van Syckel drew up, were to keep a record of all the acts of the  society, the minutes of every meeting, and accurate detailed  descriptions of all work accomplished. Therefore, while the rest of the  society was busy cutting up old sheets, levied from the surrounding  neighborhood, and sewing and rigging the sails under Bill's direction,  I, with pad and pencil in hand, took notes on all the operations.      THE DOUBLE SWEDISH SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Dimensions of Double Swedish Sail. N. B.--The mark  (') means feet and (\") means inches.]    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Halyards Looped onto Pole.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8. The Double Swedish Sail.]    Bill evolved some new types of sails which differed materially from the  type described in the first chapter. One was a double sail--\"the kind  they use in Sweden,\" he explained. One of the sheets which the foraging  party brought in was extra large; it measured approximately two yards  and a half square. This was folded on itself, making a parallelogram  seven feet six inches long and three feet nine inches wide. The sheets  we had were all rather worn and some were badly torn, so that we had to  make our sails of double thickness, sewing patches over the weak spots.  A broad hem was turned down at each end, and heavy tape was sewed on,  leaving loops as before, to attach them to the spars. This reduced the  length of our sail to seven feet three inches. The end spars were spaced  apart by a light pole about ten feet long, to which they were tied at  the points of intersection. The spars were also braced by halyards  looped over the ends of the pole in the manner indicated in the drawing  (Fig. 7). It took a crew of two boys to manipulate this sail. In use,  the pole of the rig was carried on the shoulders, and the sail was  guided by means of ropes attached to the lower corners of the vertical  spars. These ropes in nautical language are called \"sheets.\" The boy at  the rear was the pilot and did the steering, because his position behind  the sail gave him an unobstructed view in all directions. When changing  tack the sail was lifted overhead to the other side of the crew.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Changing Tack.]      THE SINGLE SWEDISH SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. The Single Swedish Sail.]    Another sail of similar form, but for use of one boy only, is shown in  Fig. 10. This had a height of six and one-half feet at the forward end  and three feet at the rear; and its length was five feet. This sail was  very satisfactory in light winds, owing to its great area. In use we  found that it was very important to keep the lower edge against the leg,  as indicated by the arrow. The rig was manipulated just like the double  Swedish sail, lifting it over the head when it was desired to change  tack.      THE LANTEEN SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig 11. The Lanteen Sail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Hinge for Spars.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13. Leather Mast Step.]    [Illustration: Fig. 14. Wooden Mast Step.]    The lanteen sail we found to be a very good rig. It was made in the form  of a triangle, measuring eight feet on one side, seven and one-half feet  on another side and six and one-half feet on the third. The six and  one-half foot side was secured to a boom, and the seven and one-half  foot side to a yard. The yard and boom were hinged together by a leather  strap nailed on as shown in Fig. 12, and to this hinge a rope was  attached, which served as a sheet. These spars were secured to a mast  erected perpendicularly to the boom and intersecting the yard a little  above its center. We had had some trouble with the first sails we made  in keeping the base of the sail against the body, and to overcome this  difficulty Bill proposed tying the bottom of the mast to the leg. This  was a rather risky thing to do, as we learned later, for in case of  accident it would be difficult to get clear of the sail. It was Reddy  who finally solved the problem by rigging up a step for the mast. It  consisted of a leather tag tied to the leg, and provided with a hole  into which the bottom of the mast was fitted. To prevent the mast from  slipping too far into the step the lower portion of it was whittled  down, leaving a shoulder which rested on the leather. Bill later devised  another step, which consisted of a wooden block (Fig. 14) strapped to  the leg and formed with a shallow socket to receive the end of the mast.      THE DANISH SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. The Danish Sail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Topsail of the Danish Rig.]    But the most satisfactory sail we found to be the Danish sail, though it  was not until we had served quite a long apprenticeship and sustained  many pretty bad falls that we mastered the art of manipulating these  sails properly. Our ideas on this sail were obtained from a French  illustrated paper which Dutchy Van Syckel picked up in his father's  library. This sail was formed with a topsail so arranged that it could  be lowered when the wind was too strong. The dimensions of the sail as  we made it are given in the drawing (Fig. 15). The top of the sail was  lashed to a spar, which was connected by a short stick to another spar  tied to the mainsail about eighteen inches lower down. The sail was  strengthened with an extra strip of cloth along the lower spar, and the  tie strings were applied in the usual way. The connecting stick, or  topmast we may call it, was hinged to the lower spar by means of a short  piece of leather strap, which was passed round the spar in the form of a  loop and its two ends nailed to the bottom of the topmast. The topmast  extended above the upper spar a short distance, and to this we fastened  the flag which our society had adopted. A couple of strong cords were  secured to the center spar to provide for fastening the sail onto the  skater. Tied to the lower corners of the mainsail were two sticks which  were used for guiding the sail when in flight.    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Before the Wind. Fig. 18. Topsail Lowered. Fig.  19. Skating against the Wind. Fig. 20. On the Port Tack.]      The different methods of sailing with this rig are shown in Figs. 17-20.  When sailing with the wind the skater would stand very erect, bending  backward in proportion as the wind blew fresher. By inclining the sail  in one direction or the other, the skater could tack to port or  starboard. When moving against the wind by skating in the usual way, the  body was bent forward in such manner that the sail lay horizontal, so  that it would not offer a purchase for the wind.      BAT'S WINGS.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    One more sail deserves mention. It was Bill's idea, and it came near to  ending his career the first day he tried it. It had no spars at all, but  was merely a strip of cloth of somewhat triangular shape. The upper side  was tied to the head, and the two corners to the wrists, while the lower  portion was tied to the ankles. This converted him into a huge  white-winged bat. Bill had to try it at once, even though the rest of  the sails were not finished, and a very comical spectacle he made as he  flapped his wings in his endeavors to tack. When the wind was too strong  for him he had merely to drop his arms and thus lower sail. At length he  became tired of holding his arms out at full length, and I got him a  stick to put over his shoulders and rest his arms on. But that stick was  Bill's undoing, for coming around a sudden bend in the canal he caught  the full force of the wind, which knocked him flat on his back before he  could disentangle himself from the stick and lower sail. It took us some  time to bring him back to consciousness, and a very scared lot of boys  we were for a while. However, the lesson was a good one, for after that  we were very cautious in experimenting with sails that had to be tied  on, such as the Danish rig and the lanteen rig, before Reddy invented  the mast step.    It was not until the day after Christmas that the sails were all  completed, but then there was scarcely any wind blowing and we could not  attempt the expedition to the island.          CHAPTER III.    SNOW SHOES, SKIS AND SWAMP SHOES.      The next day, Sunday, it began to snow, and we realized that our chance  of skating up to Willow Clump Island was spoiled. All the afternoon it  snowed, and the next morning we woke to find the ground covered to a  depth of eight inches and snow still falling. But who ever heard of a  boy complaining because there was snow on the ground? Here were new  difficulties to overcome, new problems to solve, and new sports provided  for our amusement. There was no disappointment shown by any of the  members of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I., as they met in the woodshed  immediately after breakfast to discuss proceedings for the day. There  seemed to be but one way of reaching the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#3)"],[1,"ever I can. You shall be desperately proud of  me; and so shall granny, although she doesn't hold with much learning.\"    \"But I do, little girl; I love it more than anything. I have got such a  lovely scheme in my head. I will work alongside of you, Ruth--you and I  at the same things. You can lend me the books when you don't want them.\"    \"What a splendid idea!\" said Ruth, clapping her hands.    \"You look quite happy, my dear.\"    \"And so I am. I am about the happiest girl on earth. And now, may I  begin to look through my lessons for to-morrow?\"    The old man arranged the lamp where its light would be most comfortable  for the keen young eyes, and Ruth sat down to the table, got out her  books, and worked for an hour or two. Mrs. Craven came in, looked at her  proudly, wagged her head, and returned to the kitchen. After a time she  came to the door and beckoned to the old man to follow her. But the old  man had taken up one of Ruth's books and was absorbed in its contents;  he was muttering words over under his breath.    \"Coming, wife--coming presently,\" he said.    Ruth's head was bent over her books. Mr. Craven rose and went on tiptoe  into the kitchen.    \"We mustn't disturb her, Susan,\" he said. \"We must let her have her own  way. She must work just as long as she likes. She is going to be a great  power in the land, is that child, with her beauty and her talent;  there's nothing she can't aspire to.\"    \"Now don't you be a silly old man,\" said Mrs. Craven. \"And what on earth  were you whispering about to yourself when I came in?\"    \"I am going to work with her. It will be a wonderful stimulation, and a  great interest to me. I always was keen for book-learning.\"    Mrs. Craven suppressed a sigh.    \"If I even had fifty pounds,\" she said, \"I wouldn't let that child spend  every hour at school. I'd dress up smart, and take her out, and get her  the very best husband I could. Why, old man, what does a woman want  with all that learning?\"    \"If a woman has brains she's bound to use them,\" replied the old man, as  he sat down by the kitchen fire.    Meanwhile Ruth went on with her lessons. After a time, however, she  uttered a sigh. She flung down her books and looked across the room.    \"If he only knew,\" she said under her breath--\"if he only knew that I  was practically sent to Coventry--that none of the nice girls will speak  to me. But never mind; I won't tell him. Nothing would induce me to  trouble him on the subject.\"          CHAPTER II.    HIGH LIFE AND LOW LIFE.      Amongst the many girls who attended the Great Shirley School was one who  was known by the name of Cassandra Weldon. She was rapidly approaching  the proud position of head girl in the school. She had entered the  Shirley School when quite a little child, had gone steadily up through  the different classes and the various removes, until she found herself  nearly at the head of the sixth form. She was about to try for a  sixty-pound scholarship, renewable for three years; if she got it she  would go to Holloway College, and eventually support herself and her  mother. Mrs. Weldon was the widow of a man who in his time had a very  successful school for boys, and she herself had been a teacher long ago  in the Great Shirley School. Cassandra and her mother, therefore, were  from the very first surrounded by scholarship; they belonged, so to  speak, to the scholastic world.    Mrs. Weldon could scarcely talk of anything else. Evening after evening  she would question her daughter eagerly with regard to this  accomplishment and the other, to this change or that, to this chance  which Cassandra might have and to the other. The girl was extremely  clever, with a sort of all-round talent which was most remarkable; for  in addition to many excellent accomplishments, she was distinctly  musical. Her musical talent very nearly amounted to genius. If in the  future she could not play in public, she resolved at least to earn her  living as a music teacher. Mrs. Weldon hoped that Cassandra would do  more than this; and, to tell the truth, the girl shared her mother's  dreams. Besides music, she had worked very hard at botany, at French and  German, and at English literature. She would be seventeen on her next  birthday, and it was against the rules for any girl to remain at the  Great Shirley School after that time. Cassandra had, however, two more  terms of school-life before her, and these terms she regarded as the  most valuable of her whole education.    In appearance Cassandra was a tall, well-made girl, graceful in her  movements, and very self-possessed in manner. Her face was full of  intelligence, but was rather plain than otherwise, for her mouth was too  wide and her nose the reverse of classical. She had bright intelligent  brown eyes, however, a nice voice, and a pleasant way. Cassandra was  looked up to by all her fellow-students, and this not because she was  rich, nor because she was beautiful, but simply because she was good and  honorable and trustworthy; she possessed a large amount of sympathy for  nearly every one, her tact was unfailing, and she was never  self-assertive.    Now Cassandra, who had many friends in the school, had amongst them, of  course, her greatest friend. This girl was called Florence Archer.  Florence was pretty and clever, but she had neither Cassandra's depth  nor power of intellect. She was naturally vain and frivolous, except in  the presence of her dearest friend. She was easily influenced by others,  and it was her habit to follow the one who gave her the last advice. Her  passionate love for Cassandra was perhaps her best and strongest  quality; but of late she had exhibited a sense of almost unwarrantable  jealousy when any other girl showed a preference for her special friend.  Florence was a very nice girl, but jealousy was her bane. She thought a  good deal of herself, for her father was a rich man, and only took  advantage of the Great Shirley education because it was incomparably the  best in the place. There was no rule against any one attending the  school, and he had long ago secured a niche in it for his favorite  daughter. Florence loved it and hated it at the same time. She was fond  of her own companions, but she could not bear the foundation girls.  These girls made a large percentage in the school. In all respects they  were supposed to be Florence's equals, but as a matter of fact they were  kept in a very subordinate position by the paying girls. On every  possible occasion they were avoided, and there must be something very  special about any one of them if she was taken up by the aristocrats--as  they termed themselves--of the school.    But Cassandra as a rule was perfectly sweet and pleasant to the  foundation girls, and this trait in her friend's character annoyed  Florence more than anything else.    On the morning after Ruth Craven had been admitted to the school  Cassandra was one of the first arrivals. She was standing in the wide  courtyard waiting for the school doors to be opened. She looked, as  usual, bright and capable. A stream of girls were surrounding her, each  smiling and trying to draw her attention. Cassandra was a girl of few  words, and after nodding to her companions, she gave them to understand  that she did not intend to enter into any special conversation. Her neat  satchel of school-books was slung on her arm. She wore a very dark-blue  serge dress, and her white sailor-hat looked correct and pretty on her  shining brown hair. Cassandra, with her face beaming as the sun, made a  sort of figure-head for the smaller girls. Presently three foundation  girls entered the gates side by side and glanced up at her. This trio  formed perhaps the most objectionable set in the school. One was called  Kate Rourke; she was a girl of fifteen years of age, showily dressed,  with flashing eyes, long earrings in her ears, false jewellery round her  neck, and a smart, rather shabby hat, trimmed with a lot of flowers,  placed at the back of her head. Hanging on Kate's arm might have been  seen Hannah Johnson, in all respects that young lady's double. Clara  Sawyer, a fair-haired little girl about fourteen, with a heavy fringe  right down to her eyebrows, completed the trio.    They glanced at Cassandra, and then nodded to one another and joked and  laughed.    \"I have no doubt,\" said Kate, \"that Cassie will take her up.\"    She said the word \"Cassie\" in a loud voice. Cassandra heard her, but she  took not the slightest notice.    \"She is safe to,\" continued Kate. \"Now, such a girl oughtn't to be on  the foundation at all. If you only knew the snubbing she gave me  yesterday. I quite hate her, with all her pretty face and her mincing  ways.\"    \"Never mind, Kitty,\" said Hannah Johnson. \"She may snub you as much as  she likes, but you have got me to cling on to.\"    \"And you've got me, too, Kitty,\" said Clara Sawyer. She snuggled close  up to Kate and slipped her hand through her arm.    \"Nasty thing!\" said Hannah. \"I feel every word you say, Kate. Do you  know, I offered to walk home with her yesterday, and she said, 'No, I  thank you; I prefer to walk home alone,'\"    As Hannah made this speech she adopted the mincing tones which she  supposed Ruth Craven had used. The two other girls burst out laughing.    \"Oh, do say what you are laughing about!\" said another girl, running up  to the group at this moment. Her name was Rosy Myers. \"You always have a  joke among you three, and I want to share it. Do say--do say! I've got a  lot of toffee in my pocket.\"    \"Hand it out, Rosy, and perhaps we'll tell you,\" said Kate.    Rose produced a packet of sticky sweetmeat, and a moment later the four  were sucking peppermint toffee and making themselves thoroughly  objectionable to their neighbors.    \"But what about the girl--the person you are laughing about?\" asked  Rose.    \"Oh, it's that stupid, tiresome Ruth Craven,\" answered Hannah. \"Why,  she's nobody.
