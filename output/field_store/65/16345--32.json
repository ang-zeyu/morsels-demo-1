It is only in human nature that  unsympathetic feelings against the English would intrude upon the  thanksgivings on those occasions, especially as it continues yet to be  averred that the British authorities had incited the Zulu king Dingaan  to those massacres. Nevertheless, except in instances of implacable  natures, the predominant sentiments at those gatherings were those of  gratitude to the Almighty and good-will towards all men. After the peace  of 1881, it used to be publicly recognised that the English were  entitled thenceforth to a first place in the nation's friendship, and  that the retrocession put a term to all recriminations applying to  previous dates.    The sequel has shown that soon afterwards another spirit was allowed to  intrude to displace those good and just sentiments, and that without any  reason or provocation and despite a persistently loyal and sincere  attitude of friendship and confidence observed towards the Boers by the,  British Government and the English people in South Africa. As instances  may be cited: (1) England's conceding spirit in assenting to a  modification of the convention of 1881 and agreeing to that of 1884; (2)  genial treatment of the colonial Boers on perfect equality with English  colonists, sharing in the privileges of self-government, the Dutch  language also raised to equal rights with English; (3) most harmonious  relations with the Orange Free State; (4) reduction of transit duties  for goods to the Republics to 5 per cent, and later to 3 per cent.; (5)  unrestricted privilege for the importations of arms and ammunition to  both Republics. In lieu of friendly reciprocity the return began to be  rancorous mistrust and revival of hatred.    In the course of our study to account for this sad and unwarrantable  change on the part of the Boers we will be following the trail of the  serpent and track it right up to its Hollander lair and to its at first  unsuspected product, the Afrikaner Bond.          PROSPERITY OF BOERS AND POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND UP TO 1881      A period of about twenty-five years following the establishment of the  Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics was marked with much progress  and prosperity in the Cape Colonies and Natal, both Republics also  having cause to rejoice over similar advancement.    The evil influence which aimed at rending good relations between Boer  and English became more apparent after 1881. During the preceding era  the two races actually had been in a fair way towards friendly  assimilation. Mutual appreciation was further stimulated by the  reciprocal benefits arising from trade and economic relations.  Intermarriages became more frequent under such friendly intercourse, a  respectable Englishman being truly prized in those days as a Boer's  son-in-law. The English language also largely advanced in favour and  prestige not only among the Cape Colonial and Natal Boers, but also in  both Republics, and anti-English sentiments were fast being supplanted  by amity and goodwill.    The principal event in the Orange Free State during that period was a  three years' exhaustive war with the Basuto nation, which ended in the  latter's defeat in 1867. Their chief Moshesh then appealed for British  intervention. The Basutos thus came under England's protection, and a  peace resulted which has ever since continued, through British prestige  and authority as well as good government. The Orange Free State gained a  large tract of the territory conquered by that State, but had to  renounce the rest.    Then, in about 1870, came the discovery of the diamond-fields, situated  on the then still ill-defined western limits of the State. According to  a boundary line claimed by Great Britain, those diamond-fields fell  outside Free State territory. That State received L90,000 compensation  for improvements and expenses incurred during its short occupation of  that disputed strip of diamondiferous ground. The diamond-fields at  Jagersfontein and Koffyfontein were subsequently discovered and lie deep  within the confines of the State. President Brand had proved his  sagacity and discretion in concluding the negotiations with England  upon the question of the peace with the Basutos and then again in  submitting to the boundary delimitations, it being contended even yet  that the Orange Free State had the weightier arguments in its favour in  both instances.    The people of that Republic proved however to be the ultimate gainers in  those adjustments; they did not miss the more solid advantages attending  the discovery of the diamond-fields. Believed of the grave  responsibility involved in governing a turbulent population of foreign  diggers, the geographical position of the Kimberley fields secured to  the Free State farmers an almost entire monopoly in the supply of  products; trade also flourished apace, all tending to enrich the  inhabitants and the State revenue as well.    But the Orange Free State derived a permanent advantage, quite unique  and more than compensating the apparent set-back suffered by the loss of  the diamond-field territory and by British intervention in the Basuto  war matter, in that the method of those procedures saddled England with  the responsibility of guaranteeing the internal safety of the State from  those hitherto unprotected borders \"altogether at her own cost.\" The  Keate award completed the British cordon around the Free State,  excepting only in regard to the Transvaal frontier. No need thenceforth  for costly military provisions for the protection of the State--it was,  as it were, walled and fenced in at British expense, and the State  revenue was thus for ever relieved of a very heavy item of expenditure,  which could be devoted to the increase of the national wealth instead--a  peaceful security accompanied with an intrinsic gain constituting a  veritable and permanent heirloom for the people of that State.    It is notable that the position of the Orange Free State, without any  other access to the sea-board than from colonial ports, made its status  and welfare entirely dependent upon the friendly and loyal good faith of  England. Up to the present unhappy war that State enjoyed unaltered the  best relations without being ever subjected to even a trace of chicanery  from the part of Great Britain.    By what illusion, it may well be asked, could that hitherto friendly  people have been deluded to risk all in a disloyal breach with England  by joining the Transvaal in a \"Bond\" issue against her best friend?  Towards the Transvaal also had England proved her earnest desire to  maintain an intercourse on the basis of sincere amity, desirous only of  reciprocity, which indeed could be expected in willing return, seeing  that England took upon her own shoulders to provide for the protection  and welfare of the entire area of South Africa by sea and land, whilst  both Republics freely participated in all the great benefits so derived.  These considerations should substantially disprove the wicked aspersion  lately made that British policy aimed at the subversion of republican  autonomy in those two States. All that Great Britain needed and  confidently expected in return for her goodwill was friendly adhesion,  and a willing recognition of her paramountcy in matters affecting the  common weal of South Africa as a whole, and also such reciprocity and  mutual concern in the welfare of all as consistently comport with common  interests. How fell and malignant the \"influence\" which operated a  treacherous ingratitude and hostility instead!          TRANSVAAL HISTORY--SUZERAINTY      The references made to the history of the Transvaal so far reach up to  the rehabilitation of its independence and the convention of 1881. Some  of the conditions of that treaty, especially the subordinate position  imposed by the suzerainty clause, were found to be repugnant to the  burghers. Delegates were therefore commissioned to proceed to England in  order to get the treaty so altered as to place the State into the status  provided by the Sand River convention, which conceded absolute  independence. Mr. Jorrison, a violent anti-English Hollander, was the  chief adviser of the members of that delegation.    To that the English Ministry could not assent, but sought to meet the  wishes of the people by agreeing to certain modifications of the  convention of 1881. This was effected with the treaty of 1884. The  delegates had specially urged the renunciation of the suzerainty claim,  but that claim appears not to have been abandoned, to judge from the  absence of such mention in the novated treaty. Had its renunciation been  agreed to, as has been since averred, it is quite certain that the  delegates would not have been content without the mention in most  distinct terms of that, to them, so important point. It may therefore be  assumed as a fact that the negotiations did not result in an active  suspension of the relations as set forth in the convention of 1881, and  that the Transvaal continued in a status of subordinacy to England, but  only with a wider range in regard to conditions of autonomy. To most lay  minds it therefore appears perfectly clear that the Transvaal delegates  had well understood and accepted, and so had also their Government, that  the convention of 1884 was _de facto_ a renewal of that of 1881, with  the only difference that it provided an enlarged exercise of autonomy,  but without in the least abrogating the principles of respective  relations, which were left intact, or at least latent.    It has been averred and a strong point made in the theory of repudiating  suzerainty or over-lordship that Lord Kimberley had given the assurance  that the right of Transvaal autonomy and independence was meant to equal  that of the Orange Free State.
