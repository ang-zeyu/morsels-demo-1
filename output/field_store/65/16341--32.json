Reviews.      _Beautiful Houses_. A study in house building.       By Louis H. Gibson. Illustrated. Boston T.Y. Crowell & Co. 1895.       pp. 346. $3.    This book is in many respects very attractive, and will be found  useful to architectural readers as well as to the general public.    It is divided into two parts, the first under the heading \"The World's  Houses\" and the second, \"Some House Plans\" and \"Materials and  Details.\"    The first part is that which will be of most value to the  architectural reader. In it are described the principal types of  domestic architecture, giving most prominence to the work of France.  The illustrations of this portion of the work are well chosen and very  well printed. In fact, to the architect they form the most valuable  part of the book. The second part is devoted mainly to Mr. Gibson's  own designs. These are mostly good, straightforward work, although we  can hardly agree with all of his opinions. His use of language is not  always discriminating and is sometimes misleading.    [Illustration: Design by Chas. F. Hogeboom, Jr.]    To the general reader there will be much of interest in all portions  of the book, especially if he contemplates building a house. And in  this case we sincerely trust that its perusal will result in another  commission for some fortunate architect.    [Illustration: LXXXVII. Manoir d'Ango, Normandy.]      _Handbook of the New Public Library in Boston._ Compiled by       Herbert Small. Fully illustrated. Boston, 1895. Curtis & Co.       78 pp. 16c.    The unusual interest which has been aroused in architectural circles  by the new building for the Boston Public Library is the reason for  devoting special attention to this little book in these columns.  Although intended for general readers, it has a very instructive  article by Mr. C. Howard Walker considering the building  architecturally, which will interest architectural readers. The  illustrations, made from photographs by E.E. Soderholtz, are excellent  and numerous, and the cover, printed in green and black, from the  design of B.G. Goodhue, is an additional attraction. On the whole,  even after so much in the way of illustration of this building has  been already published, it is worth the while of any architect or  draughtsman to send for this little pamphlet.          Club Notes.      The Chicago Architectural Club is keeping its members guessing to know  what scheme of work or entertainment will come next on its programme.    The annual meeting for election of officers was held October 7.  Several of the regular monthly competitions and an informal exhibition  have already come and gone, and a \"Bohemian Night\" with all its  accompaniments comes every fortnight.    The following classes have been arranged for some time ago: Water  Color, under Hugh M.G. Garden; Architecture, under George R. Dean; Pen  and Ink, under Charles E. Birge; Modeling, under Richard W. Bock.    A talk on \"The Impecunious Draughtsman Abroad\" was given by Mr. Myron  H. Hunt, and Mr. George R. Dean has given a lantern-slide exhibition,  illustrating the Chateau de Blois.    The club also held a joint meeting with the Chicago Society of  Artists, when Mr. N.S. Patton discussed the question of \"The  Architectural and Artistic Possibilities of the Lake Front.\"    The annual banquet and meeting of the Cleveland Architectural Club was  held at the Hollenden Hotel Thursday evening, November 14, with about  forty present. Dinner was served at six o'clock, followed by toasts  from Messrs. John L. Culley, F.A. Coburn, and Charles W. Hopkinson,  with President Hubbell as toastmaster.    After the speaking the annual meeting was held, with an address by the  president, reports by the secretary, treasurer, librarian, chairman of  the Current Work Committee, and the chairman of the Entertainment and  House Committee.    The club has grown from a charter membership one year ago of fourteen  to a total membership of forty-five.    The newly elected officers are: President, Benjamin S. Hubbell;  Vice-President, Frederick Baird; Secretary, Herbert B. Briggs;  Treasurer, Albert E. Skeel; Librarian, G.B. Bohm; Directors, M. James  Bowman and C.S. Schneider.    A joint exhibition of the Cleveland Architectural Club and the  Cleveland Art Association will be held in the Garfield Building, from  January 20 to February 5, 1896. Works will be received until Monday,  January 6. The exhibition will include: Architectural sketches,  perspectives, and elevations in all renderings; photographs of  executed work; landscape architecture; interior architecture and  decoration; interior furnishings (samples and sketches); architectural  and decorative metal work (wrought iron, bronze, and brass); sculpture  (architectural and ornamental).    An illustrated catalogue will be issued.    All drawings must be framed or mounted.          A Good Endorsement.      The following letter from the office of Richard M. Hunt is of interest  to all users of shingle stains:--         Dexter Bros., Boston:         _Gentlemen_,--The shingle stains we have used on some of the       buildings of Biltmore Village, N.C., furnished by you, have       given absolute satisfaction as to quality and color. We       consider your stains the best we have used so far.                     Yours respectfully,       (Signed)                 R.H. HUNT.      [Illustration: LXXXVII. Manoir d'Ango.

Every vice fights against nature.    Folly is never pleased with itself.    Pride, not nature, craves much.    The little tattler tittered at the tempest.    Titus takes the petulant outcasts.    The covetous partner is destitute of fortune.    No one of you knows where the shoe pinches.    What can not be cured must be endured.    You can not catch old birds with chaff.

Thou boast'st of what should be thy shame.    Life's fitful fever over, he rests well.    Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?    From star to star the living lightnings flash.    And glittering crowns of prostrate seraphim.    That morning, thou that slumber'd'st not before.    Habitual evils change not on a sudden.    Thou waft'd'st the rickety skiffs over the cliffs.    Thou reef'd'st the haggled, shipwrecked sails.    The honest shepherd's catarrh.    The heiress in her dishabille is humorous.    The brave chevalier behaves like a conservative.    The luscious notion of champagne and precious sugar.    III. INFLECTIONS.    Inflections are slides of the voice upward or downward. Of these, there  are two: the rising inflection and the falling inflection.    The Rising Inflection is that in which the voice slides upward, and is  marked thus ('); as,       Did you walk'? Did you walk.    The Falling Inflection is that in which the voice slides downward, and is  marked thus ('); as,      I did not walk'. I did not walk.    Both inflections are exhibited in the following question:      Did you walk' or ride'? walk or ride.    In the following examples, the first member has the rising and the second  member the falling inflection:    EXAMPLES.[1]      Is he sick', or is he well'?    Did you say valor', or value'?    Did you say statute', or statue'?    Did he act properly', or improperly'?    [Footnote 1: These questions and similar ones, with their answers, should  be repeatedly pronounced with their proper  inflection, until the  distinction between the rising and falling inflection is well understood  and easily made by the learner. He will be assisted in this by  emphasizing strongly the word which receives the inflection, thus. Did  you RIDE' or did you WALK'?]    In the following examples, the inflections are used in a contrary order,  the first member terminating with the falling and the second with the  rising inflection:    EXAMPLES.      He is well', not sick'.    I said value', not valor'.    I said statue', not statute'.    He acted properly', not improperly'.      FALLING INFLECTIONS.    Rule VI.--The falling inflection is generally proper wherever the sense is  complete.    EXAMPLES.      Truth is more wonderful than fiction'.    Men generally die as they live'.    By industry we obtain wealth'.      REMARK.--Parts of a sentence often make complete sense in themselves, and  in this case, unless qualified or restrained by the succeeding clause, or  unless the contrary is indicated by some other principle, the falling  inflection takes place according to the rule.      EXAMPLES      Truth is wonderful', even more so than fiction'.      Men generally die as they live' and by their actions we must judge of    their character'.      Exception.--When a sentence concludes with a negative clause, or with a  contrast or comparison (called also antithesis), the first member of which  requires the falling inflection, it must close with the rising inflection.  (See Rule XI, and paragraph 2, Note.)    EXAMPLES.    No one desires to be thought a fool'.    I come to bury' Caesar, not to praise' him.    He lives in England' not in France'.      REMARK.--In bearing testimony to the general character of a man we say:      He is too honorable' to be guilty of a vile' act.    But if he is accused of some act of baseness, a contrast is at once  instituted between his character and the specified act, and we change the  inflections, and say:      He is too honorable' to be guilty of such' an act.    A man may say in general terms:      I am too busy' for projects'.    But if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise, he will  change the inflections, and say:      I am too busy' for projects'.    In such cases, as the falling inflection is required in the former part by  the principle of contrast and emphasis (as will hereafter be more fully  explained), the sentence necessarily closes with the rising inflection.  Sometimes, also, emphasis alone seems to require the rising inflection on  the concluding word. See exception to Rule VII.    (5.-2.)      STRONG EMPHASIS.    RULE VII.--Language which demands strong emphasis generally requires the  falling inflection.    EXAMPLES.  1. Command or urgent entreaty; as,      Begone',    Run' to your houses, fall' upon your knees,    Pray' to the Gods to intermit the plagues.      0, save' me, Hubert' save' me I My eyes are out    Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.      2. Exclamation, especially when indicating strong emotion; as,      0, ye Gods'! ye Gods'! must I endure all this?      Hark'! Hark'! the horrid sound    Hath raised up his head.      For interrogatory exclamation, see Rule X, Remark.        SERIES OF WORDS OR MEMBERS.    3. A series of words or members, whether in the beginning or middle of a  sentence, if it does not conclude the sentence, is called a commencing  series, and usually requires the rising inflection when not emphatic.    EXAMPLES OF COMMENCING SERIES.      Wine', beauty', music', pomp', are poor expedients to heave off the load    of an hour from the heir of eternity'.      I conjure you by that which you profess,    (Howe'er you came to know it,) answer me;    Though you untie the winds and let them fight    Against the churches'; though the yeasty waves    Confound and swallow navigation' up;    Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down';    Though castles topple on their warders' heads';    Though palaces and pyramids do slope    Their heads to their foundations'; though the treasures    Of nature's germens tumble altogether',    Even till destruction sicken'; answer me    To what I ask' you.      4. A series of words or members which concludes a sentence is called a  concluding series, and each member usually has the falling inflection.    EXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING SERIES.    They, through faith, subdued kingdoms', wrought righteousness' obtained  promises', stopped the mouths of lions', quenched the violence of fire',  escaped the edge of the sword', out of weakness were made strong', waxed  valiant in fight', turned to flight the armies of the aliens'.      REMARK.--When the emphasis on these words or members is not marked, they  take the rising inflection, according to Rule IX.    EXAMPLES.      They are the offspring of restlessness', vanity', and idleness'.    Love', hope', and joy' took possession of his breast.    5. When words which naturally take the rising inflection become emphatic  by repetition or any other cause, they often take the falling inflection.    Exception to the Rule.--While the tendency of emphasis is decidedly to the  use of the falling inflection, sometimes a word to which the falling  inflection naturally belongs changes this, when it is emphatic, for the  rising inflection.    EXAMPLES.      Three thousand ducats': 't is a good round sum'.    It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is blind'.    Here sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the falling  inflection, but as they are emphatic, and the object of emphasis is to  draw attention to the word emphasized, this is here accomplished in part  by giving an unusual inflection. Some speakers would give these words the  circumflex, but it would he the rising circumflex, so that the sound would  still terminate with the rising inflection.    RULE VIII.--Questions which can not be answered by yes or no, together  with their answers, generally require the falling inflection.    EXAMPLES.    Where has he gone'?    Ans. To New York'.  What has he done'?     Ans. Nothing'.  Who did this'?         Ans. I know not'.  When did he go'?       Ans. Yesterday'.      REMARK.--It these questions are repeated, the inflection is changed  according to the principle stated under the Exception to Rule VII.      RISING INFLECTION.    RULE IX.--Where a pause is rendered proper by the meaning, and the sense  is incomplete, the rising inflection is generally required.    EXAMPLES.    To endure slander and abuse with meekness' requires no ordinary degree of  self-command',    Night coming on', both armies retired from the field of battle'.    As a dog returneth to his vomit', so a fool returneth to his folly'.    REMARK.--The person or object addressed, in ordinary conversation, comes  under this head.    EXAMPLES.    Fathers'! we once again are met in council.    My lords'! and gentlemen'! we have arrived at an awful crisis.    Age'! thou art shamed.    Rome'! thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!      Exception.--Where a word which, according to this rule, requires the  rising inflection, becomes emphatic, it generally has the falling  inflec-tion; as, when a child addresses his father, he first says,  Father'! but if he repeats it emphatically, he changes the inflection, and  says, Father'! Father'! The falling inflection is also used in formal  address; as, Fellow--citizens', Mr. President', etc.    EXAMPLES.    When we aim at a high standard, if we do not attain' it, we shall secure a  high degree of excellence.    Those who mingle with the vicious, if they do not become depraved', will  lose all delicacy of feeling."]]]
