A wild woodland and rocky scenery was around us; and when the moon  rose and shed her pale light over all I sat with Mr. Smith on the edge of  the waterfall, gazing alternately into the dim woody abyss below, and at  the red fires and picturesque groups of men, than which fancy could  scarcely image a wilder scene.    NATIVE PATH AND WELL.    April 3.    Before the day had fully dawned we were under weigh. Our course for the  first mile or two was embarrassed by ravines and scrub similar to that we  had yesterday met with; our progress was therefore very slow, but we at  length emerged on elevated sandy downs, thickly clothed with banksia  trees, and across these we came upon a well-beaten native path running to  the south by east, which was exactly our line of route. We had not  followed this path for more than four miles when we found a most  romantically-situated native well, surrounded by shrubs and graceful  wattle trees, and of a depth and size such as we had never before  observed. Here then we seated ourselves, and upon such scanty fare as we  had made a sparing breakfast. This however but very insufficiently  supplied our wants; and as we sat at this little well, thus surrounded  with such fairy scenery, a variety of philosophic reflections crossed our  minds and found vent in words. Nothing could be more delightfully  romantic than our present position. Both as regarded danger, scenery,  savages, and unknown lands, we were in precisely the situation in which  Mr. Cooper and other novelists delight to depict their travellers, with  this one woeful difference--our wallets were empty. It was in vain I  fumbled about in mine; I could neither find the remains of a venison  pasty, a fat buffalo's hump, or any other delicacy: indeed I had not the  means of keeping life and soul together for many days longer. Deeply did  we regret that we were not favoured for a few days with the company of  Mr. Cooper, that he might in our present difficulties fully initiate us  into the mysterious, nay, almost miraculous means by which his  travellers, even in the most dreary wilds, always contrived to draw forth  from their stock of provender such dainties that the bare recollection of  them made our mouths water; but the necessities of the moment would not  permit me for more than a few minutes to indulge in these speculations,  and we turned therefore from seductive travels of the imagination to the  more stringent ones of reality.    HEAVY LOADS CARRIED BY THE MEN.    I now entreated the men to disencumber themselves of a portion of the  loads which they were attempting to carry. Urged by a miscalculating  desire of gain, when the boats were abandoned they had laid hands upon  canvas and what else they thought would sell at Perth, and some of them  appeared to be resolved rather to risk their lives than the booty they  were bending under. The more tractable threw away the articles I told  them to get rid of; but neither entreaties nor menaces prevailed with the  others.    For the next three miles we still followed the native path which  continued to run south by east. The whole of this distance was over open  sandy downs, abounding in kangaroos; but we now suddenly emerged into a  rich limestone country of gently sloping hills and valleys, affording,  even at this season of the year, fair feed for sheep or cattle, and we  found springs of water at every few hundred yards, generally situated at  the edge of a large clump of trees.    After having for some time rested here I quitted the native path, which  trended too much to the eastward, and, leaving also the direction of the  limestone country which ran inland, we continued a south by east course  over a gravelly tableland in places covered with beds of clay on which  rested ponds of water. The country here was perfectly open, with clumps  of trees to the eastward. Emus and kangaroos were wandering about the  plains.    DIFFICULT SCRUB.    Two miles more brought us to an almost impenetrable belt of scrub which  lay east and west, directly athwart our path, so that we were obliged to  face it; and in two hours and a half I had forced my way through it. The  others followed, slowly emerging from the bush after me and, as we were  all totally exhausted, as well as dreadfully torn and bruised, we halted  at its edge for the night, and lighting our fires lay down to court that  repose we had so fairly earned. We had however only walked fifteen and a  half miles today.    April 4.    I again this morning used every effort to induce some more of the men to  abandon a portion of their loads. I represented to them their weak state,  the small supply of provisions they had with them, and the difficulty  they already found in keeping up with the party; but all these arguments  and every other I could make use of were unavailing; the tenacity with  which they clung to a worthless property, even at the risk of their  lives, is almost incredible, and it is to be borne in mind that this  property was not their own, but what they had taken from the wreck of the  boats. Did I even induce one to throw anything away another avaricious  fellow would pick it up; and their thoughts and conversation, instead of  running upon making the best of their way home and saying their lives,  consisted in conjectures as to what they would realize from their  ill-gotten and embarrassing booty.    SUPERIOR NATIVE PATH AND WELLS.    The course I pursued was one of 180 degrees and we soon fell in with the  native path which we had quitted yesterday; but it now became wide, well  beaten, and differing altogether by its permanent character from any I  had seen in the southern portion of this continent. For the first five  miles we traversed scrubby stony hills, thickly wooded with banksia  trees; but the limestone here again cropped out and we entered a very  fertile valley, running north and south and terminating in a larger one  which drained the country from east to west. This valley is remarkable as  containing one Xanthorrhoea (grass-tree) being the farthest point to the  north at which I have found this tree. In it also was a gigantic ant's  nest, being the most southerly one I had yet seen. All these  circumstances convinced me that we were about to enter a very interesting  region. And as we wound along the native path my wonder augmented; the  path increased in breadth and in its beaten appearance, whilst along the  side of it we found frequent wells, some of which were ten and twelve  feet deep and were altogether executed in a superior manner.    NATIVE WARRAN GROUND. PLAINS ABOUNDING IN THE WARRAN PLANT.    We now crossed the dry bed of a stream and from that emerged upon a tract  of light fertile soil, quite overrun with warran plants,* the root of  which is a favourite article of food with the natives. This was the first  time we had yet seen this plant on our journey, and now for three and a  half consecutive miles we traversed a fertile piece of land literally  perforated with the holes the natives had made to dig this root; indeed  we could with difficulty walk across it on that account, whilst this  tract extended east and west as far as we could see.    (*Footnote. The Warran in a species of Dioscorea, a sort of yam like the  sweet potato. It is known by the same name both on the east and west side  of the continent.)    It was now evident that we had entered the most thickly-populated  district of Australia that I had yet observed, and moreover one which  must have been inhabited for a long series of years, for more had here  been done to secure a provision from the ground by hard manual labour  than I could have believed it in the power of uncivilised man to  accomplish. After crossing a low limestone range we came down upon  another equally fertile warran ground, bounded eastward by a high range  of rocky limestone hills, luxuriantly grassed, and westward by a low  range of similar formation. The native path about two miles further on  crossed this latter range, and we found ourselves in a grassy valley,  about four miles wide, bounded seawards by sandy downs. Along its centre  lay a chain of reedy freshwater swamps, and native paths ran in from all  quarters to one main line of communication leading to the southward.    DANGERS OF DELAY.    In these swamps we first found the yunjid, or flag (a species of typha)  and the sow-thistle of the southern districts; one we came to was a thick  tea-tree swamp, extremely picturesque, and producing abundance of these  plants, some of which were collected by the men to eat in the evening. To  my surprise Mr. Walker here came up to me and asked if I did not think it  would be better to halt for a day or two at places of this kind to allow  the men to refresh themselves. The idea of men halting and wasting their  strength and energies in searching for native food whilst they had so  fearful a journey before them, and no supplies, appeared to me to be  preposterous in the extreme: to obtain a sufficiency of food, even for a  native, requires in Australia a great degree of skill and knowledge of  the productions of the country; but for a European, utterly unaccustomed  to this species of labour and totally unacquainted with the productions  of the land, to obtain enough to support life for any period, whilst at  the same time he has to search for water, is quite impossible. Even  Kaiber, from his ignorance of the roots, declared that he should starve  in this country. I saw therefore that did I adopt the proposed plan of  travelling only a few miles a day, and occasionally halting for a day or  two to refresh ourselves upon some thistles and periwinkles, I should  infallibly sacrifice the lives of the whole party; and under this  impression I declined to accede to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#3)"],[1,"the Ptolemies, a Greek family, had governed the  Nile Valley with the help of foreign troops. The Ptolemies had followed  close upon the Greek occupation, the Greeks having replaced the Persians  as rulers of Egypt. The Persian occupation had been preceded by an  Egyptian dynasty which had been kept on the throne by Greek and other  foreign garrisons. Previous to this there had been a Persian occupation,  which had followed a short period of native rule under foreign  influence. We then come back to the Assyrian conquest which had followed  the Ethiopian rule. Libyan kings had held the country before the  Ethiopian conquest. The XXIst and XXth Dynasties preceded the Libyans,  and here, in a disgraceful period of corrupt government, a series of  so-called native kings are met with. Foreigners, however, swarmed in the  country at the time, foreign troops were constantly used, and the  Pharaohs themselves were of semi-foreign origin. One now comes back to  the early XIXth and XVIIIth Dynasties which, although largely tinged  with foreign blood, may be said to have been Egyptian families. Before  the rise of the XVIIIth Dynasty the country was in foreign hands for the  long period which had followed the fall of the XIIth Dynasty, the  classical period of Egyptian history (about the twentieth century B.C.),  when there were no rivals to be feared. Thus the Egyptians may be said  to have been subject to foreign occupation for nearly four thousand  years, with the exception of the strong native rule of the XVIIIth  Dynasty, the semi-native rule of the three succeeding dynasties, and a  few brief periods of chaotic government in later times; and this is the  information which the archaeologist has to give to the statesman and  politician. It is a story of continual conquest, of foreign occupations  following one upon another, of revolts and massacres, of rapid  retributions and punishments. It is the story of a nation which, however  ably it may govern itself in the future, has only once in four  thousand years successfully done so in the past.      [Illustration: PL. I. The mummy of Rameses II. of Dynasty XIX.                        --CAIRO MUSEUM.]                          [_Photo by E. Brugsch Pasha._      Such information is of far-reaching value to the politician, and to  those interested, as every Englishman should be, in Imperial politics. A  nation cannot alter by one jot or tittle its fundamental  characteristics; and only those who have studied those characteristics  in the pages of history are competent to foresee the future. A certain  Englishman once asked the Khedive Ismail whether there was any news that  day about Egyptian affairs. \"That is so like all you English,\" replied  his Highness. \"You are always expecting something new to happen in Egypt  day by day. To-day is here the same as yesterday, and to-morrow will be  the same as to-day; and so it has been, and so it will be, for thousands  of years.\"[1] Neither Egypt nor any other nation will ever change; and  to this it is the archaeologist who will bear witness with his stern law  of Precedent.        [Footnote 1: E. Dicey. 'The Story of the Khedivate,' p. 528.]    I will reserve the enlarging of this subject for the next chapter: for  the present we may consider, as a second argument, the efficacy of the  past as a tonic to the present, and its ability to restore the vitality  of any age that is weakened.    In ancient Egypt at the beginning of the XXVIth Dynasty (B.C. 663) the  country was at a very low ebb. Devastated by conquests, its people  humiliated, its government impoverished, a general collapse of the  nation was imminent. At this critical period the Egyptians turned their  minds to the glorious days of old. They remodelled their arts and crafts  upon those of the classical periods, introduced again the obsolete  offices and titles of those early times, and organised the government  upon the old lines. This movement saved the country, and averted its  collapse for a few more centuries. It renewed the pride of workmanship  in a decadent people; and on all sides we see a revival which was the  direct result of an archaeological experiment.    The importance of archaeology as a reviver of artistic and industrial  culture will be realised at once if the essential part it played in the  great Italian Renaissance is called to mind. Previous to the age of  Cimabue and Giotto in Florence, Italian refinement had passed steadily  down the path of deterioration. Graeco-Roman art, which still at a high  level in the early centuries of the Christian era, entirely lost its  originality during Byzantine times, and the dark ages settled down upon  Italy in almost every walk of life. The Venetians, for example, were  satisfied with comparatively the poorest works of art imported from  Constantinople or Mount Athos: and in Florence so great was the poverty  of genius that when Cimabue in the thirteenth century painted that  famous Madonna which to our eyes appears to be of the crudest  workmanship, the little advance made by it in the direction of  naturalness was received by the city with acclamations, the very street  down which it was carried being called the \"Happy Street\" in honour of  the event. Giotto carried on his master's teachings, and a few years  later the Florentines had advanced to the standard of Fra Angelico, who  was immediately followed by the two Lippis and Botticelli. Leonardo da  Vinci, artist, architect, and engineer, was almost contemporaneous with  Botticelli, being born not much more than a hundred years after the  death of Giotto. With him art reached a level which it has never  surpassed, old traditions and old canons were revived, and in every  direction culture proceeded again to those heights from which it had  fallen.    The reader will not need to be reminded that this great renaissance was  the direct result of the study of the remains of the ancient arts of  Greece and Rome. Botticelli and his contemporaries were, in a sense,  archaeologists, for their work was inspired by the relics of ancient  days.    Now, though at first sight it seems incredible that such an age of  barbarism as that of the later Byzantine period should return, it is  indeed quite possible that a relatively uncultured age should come upon  us in the future; and there is every likelihood of certain communities  passing over to the ranks of the absolute Philistines. Socialism run  mad would have no more time to give to the intellect than it had during  the French Revolution. Any form of violent social upheaval means  catalepsy of the arts and crafts, and a trampling under foot of old  traditions. The invasions and revolts which are met with at the close of  ancient Egyptian history brought the culture of that country to the  lowest ebb of vitality. The fall of Greece put an absolute stop to the  artistic life of that nation. The invasions of Italy by the inhabitants  of less refined countries caused a set-back in civilisation for which  almost the whole of Europe suffered. Certain of the French arts and  crafts have never recovered from the effects of the Revolution.    A national convulsion of one kind or another is to be expected by every  country; and history tells us that such a convulsion is generally  followed by an age of industrial and artistic coma, which is brought to  an end not so much by the introduction of foreign ideas as by a  renascence of the early traditions of the nation. It thus behoves every  man to interest himself in the continuity of these traditions, and to  see that they are so impressed upon the mind that they shall survive all  upheavals, or with ease be re-established.    There is no better tonic for a people who have weakened, and whose arts,  crafts, and industries have deteriorated than a return to the conditions  which obtained at a past age of national prosperity; and there are few  more repaying tasks in the long-run than that of reviving an interest in  the best periods of artistic or industrial activity. This can only be  effected by the study of the past, that is to say by archaeology.    It is to be remembered, of course, that the sentimental interest in  antique objects which, in recent years, has given a huge value to all  ancient things, regardless of their intrinsic worth, is a dangerous  attitude, unless it is backed by the most expert knowledge; for instead  of directing the attention only to the best work of the best periods, it  results in the diminishing of the output of modern original work and the  setting of little of worth in its place. A person of a certain  fashionable set will now boast that there is no object in his room less  than two hundred years old: his only boast, however, should be that the  room contains nothing which is not of intrinsic beauty, interest, or  good workmanship. The old chairs from the kitchen are dragged into the  drawing-room--because they are old; miniatures unmeritoriously painted  by unknown artists for obscure clients are nailed in conspicuous  places--because they are old; hideous plates and dishes, originally made  by ignorant workmen for impoverished peasants, are enclosed in glass  cases--because they are old; iron-bound chests, which had been cheaply  made to suit the purses of farmers, are rescued from the cottages of  their descendants and sold for fabulous sums--because they are old.    A person who fills a drawing-room with chairs, tables, and ornaments,  dating from the reign of Queen Anne, cannot say that he does so because  he wishes it to look like a room of that date; for if this were his  desire, he would have to furnish it with objects which appeared to be  newly made, since in the days of Queen Anne the first quality noticeable  in them would have been their newness. In fact, to produce the desired  effect everything in the room, with very few exceptions, would have to  be a replica. To sit in this room full of antiques in a frock-coat would  "]]]
