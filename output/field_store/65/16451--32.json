Then strings were stretched  across a crevice for the wind to play upon and there was the AEolian  harp. The second stage was entered when Hermes strung the tortoise shell  and plucked it with his fingers and when Athena, raising the wind from  her own lungs, forced it through a hollow reed. From these beginnings we  have the organ and the orchestra, producing such sounds as nothing in  nature can equal.    The first idol was doubtless a meteorite fallen from heaven or a  fulgurite or concretion picked up from the sand, bearing some slight  resemblance to a human being. Later man made gods in his own image, and  so sculpture and painting grew until now the creations of futuristic art  could be worshiped--if one wanted to--without violation of the second  commandment, for they are not the likeness of anything that is in heaven  above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the  earth.    In the textile industry the same development is observable. The  primitive man used the skins of animals he had slain to protect his own  skin. In the course of time he--or more probably his wife, for it is to  the women rather than to the men that we owe the early steps in the arts  and sciences--fastened leaves together or pounded out bark to make  garments. Later fibers were plucked from the sheepskin, the cocoon and  the cotton-ball, twisted together and woven into cloth. Nowadays it is  possible to make a complete suit of clothes, from hat to shoes, of any  desirable texture, form and color, and not include any substance to be  found in nature. The first metals available were those found free in  nature such as gold and copper. In a later age it was found possible to  extract iron from its ores and today we have artificial alloys made of  multifarious combinations of rare metals. The medicine man dosed his  patients with decoctions of such roots and herbs as had a bad taste or  queer look. The pharmacist discovered how to extract from these their  medicinal principle such as morphine, quinine and cocaine, and the  creative chemist has discovered how to make innumerable drugs adapted to  specific diseases and individual idiosyncrasies.    In the later or creative stages we enter the domain of chemistry, for it  is the chemist alone who possesses the power of reducing a substance to  its constituent atoms and from them producing substances entirely new.  But the chemist has been slow to realize his unique power and the world  has been still slower to utilize his invaluable services. Until recently  indeed the leaders of chemical science expressly disclaimed what should  have been their proudest boast. The French chemist Lavoisier in 1793  defined chemistry as \"the science of analysis.\" The German chemist  Gerhardt in 1844 said: \"I have demonstrated that the chemist works in  opposition to living nature, that he burns, destroys, analyzes, that the  vital force alone operates by synthesis, that it reconstructs the  edifice torn down by the chemical forces.\"    It is quite true that chemists up to the middle of the last century were  so absorbed in the destructive side of their science that they were  blind to the constructive side of it. In this respect they were less  prescient than their contemned predecessors, the alchemists, who,  foolish and pretentious as they were, aspired at least to the formation  of something new.    It was, I think, the French chemist Berthelot who first clearly  perceived the double aspect of chemistry, for he defined it as \"the  science of analysis _and synthesis_,\" of taking apart and of putting  together. The motto of chemistry, as of all the empirical sciences, is  _savoir c'est pouvoir_, to know in order to do. This is the pragmatic  test of all useful knowledge. Berthelot goes on to say:         Chemistry creates its object. This creative faculty, comparable       to that of art itself, distinguishes it essentially from the       natural and historical sciences.... These sciences do not       control their object. Thus they are too often condemned to an       eternal impotence in the search for truth of which they must       content themselves with possessing some few and often uncertain       fragments. On the contrary, the experimental sciences have the       power to realize their conjectures.... What they dream of that       they can manifest in actuality....         Chemistry possesses this creative faculty to a more eminent       degree than the other sciences because it penetrates more       profoundly and attains even to the natural elements of       existences.    Since Berthelot's time, that is, within the last fifty years, chemistry  has won its chief triumphs in the field of synthesis. Organic chemistry,  that is, the chemistry of the carbon compounds, so called because it was  formerly assumed, as Gerhardt says, that they could only be formed by  \"vital force\" of organized plants and animals, has taken a development  far overshadowing inorganic chemistry, or the chemistry of mineral  substances. Chemists have prepared or know how to prepare hundreds of  thousands of such \"organic compounds,\" few of which occur in the natural  world.    But this conception of chemistry is yet far from having been accepted by  the world at large. This was brought forcibly to my attention during the  publication of these chapters in \"The Independent\" by various letters,  raising such objections as the following:         When you say in your article on \"What Comes from Coal Tar\" that       \"Art can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business\" you have       doubtless for the moment allowed your enthusiasm to sweep you       away from the moorings of reason. Shakespeare, anticipating you       and your \"Creative Chemistry,\" has shown the utter       untenableness of your position:                Nature is made better by no mean,              But nature makes that mean: so o'er that art,              Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art              That nature makes.         How can you say that art surpasses nature when you know very       well that nothing man is able to make can in any way equal the       perfection of all nature's products?         It is blasphemous of you to claim that man can improve the       works of God as they appear in nature. Only the Creator can       create. Man only imitates, destroys or defiles God's handiwork.    No, it was not in momentary absence of mind that I claimed that man  could improve upon nature in the making of dyes. I not only said it, but  I proved it. I not only proved it, but I can back it up. I will give a  million dollars to anybody finding in nature dyestuffs as numerous,  varied, brilliant, pure and cheap as those that are manufactured in the  laboratory. I haven't that amount of money with me at the moment, but  the dyers would be glad to put it up for the discovery of a satisfactory  natural source for their tinctorial materials. This is not an opinion of  mine but a matter of fact, not to be decided by Shakespeare, who was not  acquainted with the aniline products.    Shakespeare in the passage quoted is indulging in his favorite amusement  of a play upon words. There is a possible and a proper sense of the word  \"nature\" that makes it include everything except the supernatural.  Therefore man and all his works belong to the realm of nature. A  tenement house in this sense is as \"natural\" as a bird's nest, a peapod  or a crystal.    But such a wide extension of the term destroys its distinctive value. It  is more convenient and quite as correct to use \"nature\" as I have used  it, in contradistinction to \"art,\" meaning by the former the products of  the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, excluding the designs,  inventions and constructions of man which we call \"art.\"    We cannot, in a general and abstract fashion, say which is superior, art  or nature, because it all depends on the point of view. The worm loves a  rotten log into which he can bore. Man prefers a steel cabinet into  which the worm cannot bore. If man cannot improve Upon nature he has no  motive for making anything. Artificial products are therefore superior  to natural products as measured by man's convenience, otherwise they  would have no reason for existence.    Science and Christianity are at one in abhorring the natural man and  calling upon the civilized man to fight and subdue him. The conquest of  nature, not the imitation of nature, is the whole duty of man.  Metchnikoff and St. Paul unite in criticizing the body we were born  with. St. Augustine and Huxley are in agreement as to the eternal  conflict between man and nature. In his Romanes lecture on \"Evolution  and Ethics\" Huxley said: \"The ethical progress of society depends, not  on imitating the cosmic process, still less on running away from it, but  on combating it,\" and again: \"The history of civilization details the  steps by which man has succeeded in building up an artificial world  within the cosmos.\"    There speaks the true evolutionist, whose one desire is to get away from  nature as fast and far as possible. Imitate Nature? Yes, when we cannot  improve upon her. Admire Nature? Possibly, but be not blinded to her  defects. Learn from Nature? We should sit humbly at her feet until we  can stand erect and go our own way. Love Nature? Never! She is our  treacherous and unsleeping foe, ever to be feared and watched and  circumvented, for at any moment and in spite of all our vigilance she  may wipe out the human race by famine, pestilence or earthquake and  within a few centuries obliterate every trace of its achievement. The  wild beasts that man has kept at bay for a few centuries will in the end  invade his palaces: the moss will envelop his walls and the lichen  disrupt them. The clam may survive man by as many millennia as it  preceded him.

This is why the stream is crowded in the warm afternoons with all sorts  of water craft loaded with whole families, even to the babies, taking  the air, or crossing from bank to bank in their daily pursuits.    There is a quality which one never sees in Nature until she has been  rough-handled by man and has outlived the usage. It is the picturesque.  In the deep recesses of the primeval forest, along the mountain-slope,  and away up the tumbling brook, Nature may be majestic, beautiful, and  even sublime; but she is never picturesque. This quality comes only  after the axe and the saw have let the sunlight into the dense tangle  and have scattered the falling timber, or the round of the water-wheel  has divided the rush of the brook. It is so here. Some hundred years  ago, along this quiet, silvery stream were encamped the troops of the  struggling colonies, and, later, the great estates of the survivors  stretched on each side for miles. The willows that now fringe these  banks were saplings then; and they and the great butternuts were only  spared because their arching limbs shaded the cattle knee-deep along the  shelving banks.    Then came the long interval that succeeds that deadly conversion of the  once sweet farming lands, redolent with clover, into that barren  waste--suburban property. The conflict that had lasted since the days  when the pioneer's axe first rang through the stillness of the forest  was nearly over; Nature saw her chance, took courage, and began that  regeneration which is exclusively her own. The weeds ran riot; tall  grasses shot up into the sunlight, concealing the once well-trimmed  banks; and great tangles of underbrush and alders made lusty efforts to  hide the traces of man's unceasing cruelty. Lastly came this little  group of poor people from the Seine and the Marne and lent a helping  hand, bringing with them something of their old life at home,--their  boats, rude landings, patched-up water-stairs, fences, arbors, and  vine-covered cottages,--unconsciously completing the picture and adding  the one thing needful--a human touch. So Nature, having outlived the  wrongs of a hundred years, has here with busy fingers so woven a web of  weed, moss, trailing vine, and low-branching tree that there is seen a  newer and more entrancing quality in her beauty, which, for want of a  better term, we call the picturesque.    But madame is calling that the big boat must be bailed out; that if I  am ever coming back to dinner it is absolutely necessary that I should  go away. This boat is not of extraordinary size. It is called the big  boat from the fact that it has one more seat than the one in which  Lucette rowed me over; and not being much in use except on Sunday, is  generally half full of water. Lucette insists on doing the bailing. She  has very often performed this service, and I have always considered it  as included in the curious scrawl of a bill which madame gravely  presents at the end of each of my days here, beginning in small printed  type with \"Francois Laguerre, Restaurant Francais,\" and ending with  \"Coffee 10 cents.\"    But this time I resist, remarking that she will hurt her hands and soil  her shoes, and that it is all right as it is.    To this Francois the younger, who is leaning over the fence, agrees,  telling Lucette to wait until he gets a pail.    Lucette catches his eye, colors a little, and says she will fetch it.    There is a break in the palings through which they both disappear, but I  am half-way out on the stream, with my traps and umbrella on the seat in  front and my coat and waistcoat tucked under the bow, before they  return.    For half a mile down-stream there is barely a current. Then comes a  break of a dozen yards just below the perched-up bridge, and the stream  divides, one part rushing like a mill-race, and the other spreading  itself softly around the roots of leaning willows, oozing through beds  of water-plants, and creeping under masses of wild grapes and  underbrush. Below this is a broad pasture fringed with another and  larger growth of willows. Here the weeds are breast-high, and in early  autumn they burst into purple asters, and white immortelles, and  goldenrod, and flaming sumac.    If a painter had a lifetime to spare, and loved this sort of  material,--the willows, hillsides, and winding stream,--he would grow  old and weary before he could paint it all; and yet no two of his  compositions need be alike. I have tied my boat under these same willows  for ten years back, and I have not yet exhausted one corner of this  neglected pasture.    There may be those who go a-fishing and enjoy it. The arranging and  selecting of flies, the joining of rods, the prospective comfort in high  water-boots, the creel with the leather strap,--every crease in it a  reminder of some day without care or fret,--all this may bring the flush  to the cheek and the eager kindling of the eye, and a certain sort of  rest and happiness may come with it; but--they have never gone  a-sketching! Hauled up on the wet bank in the long grass is your boat,  with the frayed end of the painter tied around some willow that offers a  helping root. Within a stone's throw, under a great branching of gnarled  trees, is a nook where the curious sun, peeping at you through the  interlaced leaves, will stencil Japanese shadows on your white umbrella.  Then the trap is unstrapped, the stool opened, the easel put up, and you  set your palette. The critical eye with which you look over your  brush-case and the care with which you try each feather point upon your  thumb-nail are but an index of your enjoyment.    Now you are ready. You loosen your cravat, hang your coat to some rustic  peg in the creviced bark of the tree behind you, seize a bit of charcoal  from your bag, sweep your eye around, and dash in a few guiding  strokes. Above is a turquoise sky filled with soft white clouds; behind  you the great trunks of the many-branched willows; and away off, under  the hot sun, the yellow-green of the wasted pasture, dotted with patches  of rock and weeds, and hemmed in by the low hills that slope to the  curving stream.    It is high noon. There is a stillness in the air that impresses you,  broken only by the low murmur of the brook behind and the ceaseless song  of the grasshopper among the weeds in front. A tired bumblebee hums  past, rolls lazily over a clover blossom at your feet, and has his  midday luncheon. Under the maples near the river's bend stands a group  of horses, their heads touching. In the brook below are the patient  cattle, with patches of sunlight gilding and bronzing their backs and  sides. Every now and then a breath of cool air starts out from some  shaded retreat, plays around your forehead, and passes on. All nature  rests. It is her noontime.    But you work on: an enthusiasm has taken possession of you; the paints  mix too slowly; you use your thumb, smearing and blending with a bit of  rag--anything for the effect. One moment you are glued to your seat,  your eye riveted on your canvas, the next, you are up and backing away,  taking it in as a whole, then pouncing down upon it quickly, belaboring  it with your brush. Soon the trees take shape; the sky forms become  definite; the meadow lies flat and loses itself in the fringe of  willows.    When all of this begins to grow upon your once blank canvas, and some  lucky pat matches the exact tone of blue-gray haze or shimmer of leaf,  or some accidental blending of color delights you with its truth, a  tingling goes down your backbone, and a rush surges through your veins  that stirs you as nothing else in your whole life will ever do. The  reaction comes the next day when, in the cold light of your studio, you  see how far short you have come and how crude and false is your best  touch compared with the glory of the landscape in your mind and heart.  But the thrill that it gave you will linger forever.    But I hear a voice behind me calling out:--    \"Monsieur, mamma says that dinner will be ready in half an hour. Please  do not be late.\"    It is Lucette. She and Francois have come down in the other boat--the  one with the little seat. They have moved so noiselessly that I have not  even heard them. The sketch is nearly finished; and so, remembering the  good madame, and the Roquefort, and the olives, and the many times I  have kept her waiting, I wash my brushes at once, throw my traps into  the boat, and pull back through the winding turn, Francois taking the  mill-race, and in the swiftest part springing to the bank and towing  Lucette, who sits in the stern, her white skirts tucked around her  dainty feet.    \"_Sacre!_ He is here. _C'est merveilleux!_ Why did you come?\"    \"Because you sent for me, madame, and I am hungry.\"    \"_Mon Dieu!_ He is hungry, and no chicken!\"    It is true. The chicken was served that morning to another tramp for  breakfast, and madame had forgotten all about it, and had ransacked the  settlement for its mate. She was too honest a cook to chase another into  the frying-pan.    But there was a _filet_ with mushrooms, and a most surprising salad of  chicory fresh from the garden, and the pease were certain, and the  Roquefort and the olives beyond question. All this she tells me as I  walk past the table covered with a snow-white cloth and spread under the  grape-vines overlooking the stream, with the trees standing against the  sky, their long shadows wrinkling down into the water.    I enter the summer kitchen built out into the garden, which also covers  the old well, let down the bucket, and then, taking the clean crash  towel from its hook, place the basin on the bench in the sunlight, and  plunge my head into the cool water. Madame regards me curiously, her  arms akimbo, re-hangs the towel, and asks:--    \"Well, what about the wine? The same?\"    \"Yes; but I will get it myself.\"    "]]]
