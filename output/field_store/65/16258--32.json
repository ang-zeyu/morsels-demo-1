We herewith give directions for producing the  desired physical and mental condition, in which meditation and  concentration are more readily practiced. This state of Meditation will  be referred to in subsequent exercises, so the Candidate is advised to  acquaint himself thoroughly with it.    STATE OF MEDITATION. If possible, retire to a quiet place or room, where  you do not fear interruption, so that your mind may feel secure and at  rest. Of course, the ideal condition cannot always be obtained, in which  case you must do the best you can. The idea is that you should be able to  abstract yourself, so far as is possible, from distracting impressions,  and you should be alone with yourself--in communion with your Real Self.    It is well to place yourself in an easy chair, or on a couch, so that you  may relax the muscles and free the tension of your nerves. You should be  able to \"let go\" all over, allowing every muscle to become limp, until a  feeling of perfect peace and restful calm permeates every particle of  your being. Rest the body and calm the mind. This condition is best in  the earlier stages of the practice, although after the Candidate has  acquired a degree of mastery he will be able to obtain the physical  relaxation and mental calm whenever and wherever he desires.    But he must guard against acquiring a \"dreamy\" way of going around,  wrapped in meditation when he should be attending to the affairs of life.  _Remember this_, the State of Meditation should be entirely under the  control of the Will, and should be entered into only deliberately and at  the proper times. The Will must be master of this, as well as of every  other mental state. The Initiates are not \"day dreamers,\" but men and  women having full control of themselves and their moods. The \"I\"  consciousness while developed by meditation and consciousness, soon  becomes a fixed item of consciousness, and does not have to be produced  by meditation. In time of trial, doubt, or trouble, the consciousness may  be brightened by an effort of the Will (as we shall explain in subsequent  lessons) without going into the State of Meditation.    THE REALIZATION OF THE \"I.\" The Candidate must first acquaint himself  with the reality of the \"I,\" before he will be able to learn its real  nature. This is the first step. Let the Candidate place himself in the  State of Meditation, as heretofore described. Then let him concentrate  his entire attention upon his Individual Self, shutting out all thought  of the outside world, and other persons. Let him form in his mind the  idea of himself as a _real_ thing--an actual being--an individual  entity--a Sun around which revolves the world. He must see himself as the  Centre around which the whole world revolves. Let not a false modesty, or  sense of depreciation interfere with this idea, for you are not denying  the right of others to also consider themselves centres. You are, in  fact, a centre of consciousness--made so by the Absolute--and you are  awakening to the fact. Until the Ego recognizes itself as a Centre of  Thought, Influence and Power, it will not be able to _manifest_ these  qualities. And in proportion as it recognizes its position as a centre,  so will it be able to manifest its qualities. It is not necessary that  you should compare yourself with others, or imagine yourself greater or  higher than them. In fact, such comparisons are to be regretted, and are  unworthy of the advanced Ego, being a mark and indication of a lack of  development, rather than the reverse. In the Meditation simply ignore all  consideration of the respective qualities of others, and endeavor to  realize the fact that YOU are a great Centre of Consciousness--a Centre  of Power--a Centre of Influence--a Centre of Thought. And that like the  planets circling around the sun, so does your world revolve around YOU  who are its centre. It will not be necessary for you to argue out this  matter, or to convince yourself of its truth by intellectual reasoning.  The knowledge does not come in that way. It comes in the shape of a  realization of the truth gradually dawning upon your consciousness  through meditation and concentration. Carry this thought of yourself as a  \"Centre of Consciousness--Influence--Power\" with you, _for it is an  occult truth,_ and in the proportion that you are able, to realize it so  will be your ability to manifest the qualities named.    No matter how humble may be your position--no matter how hard may be your  lot--no matter how deficient in educational advantages you may be--still  you would not change your \"I\" with the most fortunate, wisest and highest  man or woman in the world. You may doubt this, but think for a moment and  you will see that we are right. When you say that you \"would like to be\"  this person or that, you really mean that _you_ would like to have their  degree of intelligence, power, wealth, position, or what not. What you  want is something that is theirs, or something akin to it. But you would  not for a moment wish to merge your _identity_ with theirs, or to  exchange _selves_. Think of this for a moment To _be_ the other person  you would have to let _yourself_ die, and instead of _yourself_ you would  be the other person. The real _you_ would be wiped out of existence, and  you would not be _you_ at all, but would be _he_.    If you can but grasp this idea you will see that not for a moment would  you be willing for such an exchange. Of course such an exchange is  impossible. The \"I\" of you cannot be wiped out. It is eternal, and will  go on, and on, and on, to higher and higher states--but it always will be  the same \"I.\" Just as you, although a far different sort of person from  your childhood self, still you recognize that the same \"I\" is there, and  always has been there. And although you will attain knowledge,  experience, power and wisdom in the coming years, the same \"I\" will be  there. The \"I\" is the Divine Spark and cannot be extinguished.    The majority of people in the present stage of the race development have  but a faint conception of the reality of the \"I.\" They accept the  statement of its existence, and are conscious of themselves as an eating,  sleeping, living creature--something like a higher form of animal. But  they have not awakened to an \"awareness\" or realization of the \"I,\" which  must come to all who become real centres of Influence and Power. Some men  have stumbled into this consciousness, or a degree of it, without  understanding the matter. They have \"felt\" the truth of it, and they have  stepped out from the ranks of the commonplace people of the world, and  have become powers for good or bad. This is unfortunate to some extent,  as this \"awareness\" without the knowledge that should accompany it may  bring pain to the individual and others.    The Candidate must meditate upon the \"I,\" and recognize it--_feel_ it--to  be a Centre. This is his first task. Impress upon your mind the word \"I,\"  in this sense and understanding, and let it sink deep down into your  consciousness, so that it will become a part of you. And when you say  \"I,\" you must accompany the word with the picture of your Ego as a Centre  of Consciousness, and Thought, and Power, and Influence. See yourself  thus, surrounded by your world. Wherever you go, there goes the Centre of  your world. YOU are the Centre, and all outside of you revolves around  that Centre. This is the first great lesson on the road to Initiation.  Learn it!    The Yogi Masters teach the Candidates that their realization of the \"I\"  as a Centre may be hastened by going into the Silence, or State of  Meditation, and repeating their first name over slowly, deliberately and  solemnly a number of times. This exercise tends to cause the mind to  centre upon the \"I,\" and many cases of dawning Initiation have resulted  from this practice. Many original thinkers have stumbled upon this  method, without having been taught it. A noted example is that of Lord  Tennyson, who has written that he attained a degree of Initiation in this  way. He would repeat his own name, over and over, and the same time  meditating upon his identity, and he reports that he would become  conscious and \"aware\" of his reality and immortality--in short would  recognize himself as a _real_ center of consciousness.    We think we have given you the key to the first stage of meditation and  concentration. Before passing on, let us quote from one of the old Hindu  Masters. He says, regarding this matter: \"When the soul sees itself as a  Centre surrounded by its circumference--when the Sun knows that it is a  Sun, and is surrounded by its whirling planets--then is it ready for the  Wisdom and Power of the Masters.\"    THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE \"I\" FROM THE BODY. Many of the  Candidates find themselves prevented from a full realization of the \"I\"  (even after they have begun to grasp it) by the confusing of the reality  of the \"I\" with the sense of the physical body. This is a stumbling block  that is easily overcome by meditation and concentration, the independence  of the \"I\" often becoming manifest to the Candidate in a flash, upon the  proper thought being used as the subject of meditation.    The exercise is given as follows: Place yourself in the State of  Meditation, and think of YOURSELF--the Real \"I\"--as being independent of  the body, but using the body as a covering and an instrument. Think of  the body as you might of a suit of clothes. Realize that you are able to  leave the body, and still be the same \"I.\" Picture yourself as doing  this, and looking down upon your body. Think of the body as a shell from  which you may emerge without affecting your identity. Think of yourself  as mastering and controlling the body that you occupy, and using it to  the best advantage, making it healthy, strong and vigorous, but still  being merely a shell or covering for the real \"You.\" Think of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#3)"],[1,"  skilful; and mother and I will pray the Virgin to guide your hand.\"    \"Thank you, little Kate. You shall pray to our Lady, and our mother  shall buy me vellum and the colours to illuminate with.\"    \"What will they cost, my lad?\"    \"Two gold crowns\" (about three shillings and fourpence English money).    \"What!\" screamed the housewife, \"when the bushel of rye costs but a  groat! What! me spend a month's meal and meat and fire on such vanity as  that: the lightning from Heaven would fall on me, and my children would  all be beggars.\"    \"Mother!\" sighed little Catherine, imploringly.    \"Oh! it is in vain, Kate,\" said Gerard, with a sigh. \"I shall have to  give it up, or ask the dame Van Eyck. She would give it me, but I think  shame to be for ever taking from her.\"    \"It is not her affair,\" said Catherine, very sharply; \"what has she to  do coming between me and my son?\" and she left the room with a red  face. Little Catherine smiled. Presently the housewife returned with a  gracious, affectionate air, and two little gold pieces in her hand.    \"There, sweetheart,\" said she, \"you won't have to trouble dame or  demoiselle for two paltry crowns.\"    But on this Gerard fell a thinking how he could spare her purse.    \"One will do, mother. I will ask the good monks to let me send my copy  of their 'Terence:' it is on snowy vellum, and I can write no better:  so then I shall only need six sheets of vellum for my borders and  miniatures, and gold for my ground, and prime colours--one crown will  do.'    \"Never tyne the ship for want of a bit of tar, Gerard,\" said his  changeable mother. But she added, \"Well, there, I will put the crown in  my pocket. That won't be like putting it back in the box. Going to the  box to take out instead of putting in, it is like going to my heart with  a knife for so many drops of blood. You will be sure to want it, Gerard.  The house is never built for less than the builder counted on.\"    Sure enough, when the time came, Gerard longed to go to Rotterdam and  see the Duke, and above all to see the work of his competitors, and  so get a lesson from defeat. And the crown came out of the housewife's  pocket with a very good grace. Gerard would soon be a priest. It seemed  hard if he might not enjoy the world a little before separating himself  from it for life.    The night before he went, Margaret Van Eyck asked him to take a letter  for her, and when he came to look at it, to his surprise he found it was  addressed to the Princess Marie, at the Stadthouse in Rotterdam.    The day before the prizes were to be distributed, Gerard started for  Rotterdam in his holiday suit, to wit, a doublet of silver-grey cloth,  with sleeves, and a jerkin of the same over it, but without sleeves.  From his waist to his heels he was clad in a pair of tight-fitting  buckskin hose fastened by laces (called points) to his doublet. His  shoes were pointed, in moderation, and secured by a strap that passed  under the hollow of the foot. On his head and the back of his neck he  wore his flowing hair, and pinned to his back between his shoulders was  his hat: it was further secured by a purple silk ribbon little Kate had  passed round him from the sides of the hat, and knotted neatly on  his breast; below his hat, attached to the upper rim of his broad  waist-belt, was his leathern wallet. When he got within a league of  Rotterdam he was pretty tired, but he soon fell in with a pair that were  more so. He found an old man sitting by the roadside quite worn out, and  a comely young woman holding his hand, with a face brimful of concern.  The country people trudged by, and noticed nothing amiss; but Gerard, as  he passed, drew conclusions. Even dress tells a tale to those who study  it so closely as he did, being an illuminator. The old man wore a gown,  and a fur tippet, and a velvet cap, sure signs of dignity; but the  triangular purse at his girdle was lean, the gown rusty, the fur worn,  sure signs of poverty. The young woman was dressed in plain russet  cloth: yet snow-white lawn covered that part of her neck the gown left  visible, and ended half way up her white throat in a little band of gold  embroidery; and her head-dress was new to Gerard: instead of hiding her  hair in a pile of linen or lawn, she wore an open network of silver cord  with silver spangles at the interstices: in this her glossy auburn hair  was rolled in front into two solid waves, and supported behind in a  luxurious and shapely mass. His quick eye took in all this, and the old  man's pallor, and the tears in the young woman's eyes. So when he had  passed them a few yards, he reflected, and turned back, and came towards  them bashfully.    \"Father, I fear you are tired.\"    \"Indeed, my son, I am,\" replied the old man, \"and faint for lack of  food.\"    Gerard's address did not appear so agreeable to the girl as to the old  man. She seemed ashamed, and with much reserve in her manner, said,  that it was her fault--she had underrated the distance, and imprudently  allowed her father to start too late in the day.    \"No, no,\" said the old man; \"it is not the distance, it is the want of  nourishment.\"    The girl put her arms round his neck with tender concern, but took that  opportunity of whispering, \"Father, a stranger--a young man!\"    But it was too late. Gerard, with simplicity, and quite as a matter of  course, fell to gathering sticks with great expedition. This done, he  took down his wallet, out with the manchet of bread and the iron flask  his careful mother had put up, and his everlasting tinder-box; lighted a  match, then a candle-end, then the sticks; and put his iron flask on it.  Then down he went on his stomach, and took a good blow: then looking up,  he saw the girl's face had thawed, and she was looking down at him and  his energy with a demure smile. He laughed back to her. \"Mind the pot,\"  said he, \"and don't let it spill, for Heaven's sake: there's a cleft  stick to hold it safe with;\" and with this he set off running towards a  corn-field at some distance.    Whilst he was gone, there came by, on a mule with rich purple housings,  an old man redolent of wealth. The purse at his girdle was plethoric,  the fur on his tippet was ermine, broad and new.    It was Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, the burgomaster of Tergou.    He was old, and his face furrowed. He was a notorious miser, and looked  one generally. But the idea of supping with the Duke raised him just now  into manifest complacency. Yet at the sight of the faded old man and his  bright daughter sitting by a fire of sticks, the smile died out of his  face, and he wore a strange look of pain and uneasiness. He reined in  his mule.    \"Why, Peter,--Margaret,\" said he, almost fiercely, \"what mummery is  this?\" Peter was going to answer, but Margaret interposed hastily, and  said: \"My father was exhausted, so I am warming something to give him  strength before we go on.\"    \"What! reduced to feed by the roadside like the Bohemians,\" said  Ghysbrecht, and his hand went into his purse; but it did not seem at  home there; it fumbled uncertainly, afraid too large a coin might stick  to a finger and come out.    At this moment who should come bounding up but Gerard. He had two straws  in his hand, and he threw himself down by the fire and relieved Margaret  of the cooking part: then suddenly recognizing the burgomaster, he  coloured all over. Ghysbrecht Van Swieten started and glared at him,  and took his hand out of his purse. \"Oh!\" said he bitterly, \"I am  not wanted,\" and went slowly on, casting a long look of suspicion on  Margaret, and hostility on Gerard, that was not very intelligible.  However, there was something about it that Margaret could read enough  to blush at, and almost toss her head. Gerard only stared with surprise.  \"By St. Bavon, I think the old miser grudges us three our quart  of soup,\" said he. When the young man put that interpretation on  Ghysbrecht's strange and meaning look, Margaret was greatly relieved,  and smiled gaily on the speaker.    Meanwhile Ghysbrecht plodded on, more wretched in his wealth than these  in their poverty. And the curious thing is, that the mule, the purple  housings, and one-half the coin in that plethoric purse, belonged not to  Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, but to that faded old man and that comely girl,  who sat by a roadside fire to be fed by a stranger. They did not know  this; but Ghysbrecht knew it, and carried in his heart a scorpion of  his own begetting; that scorpion is remorse--the remorse that, not  being penitence, is incurable, and ready for fresh misdeeds upon a fresh  temptation.    Twenty years ago, when Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was a hard and honest man,  the touchstone opportunity came to him, and he did an act of heartless  roguery. It seemed a safe one. It had hitherto proved a safe one, though  he had never felt safe. To-day he had seen youth, enterprise, and, above  all, knowledge, seated by fair Margaret and her father on terms that  look familiar and loving.    And the fiends are at big ear again.        CHAPTER II    \"The soup is hot,\" said Gerard.    \"But how are we to get it to our mouths?\" inquired the senior,  despondingly.    \"Father, the young man has brought us straws.\" And Margaret smiled  slily.    \"Ay, ay!\" said the old man; \"but my poor bones are stiff, and indeed the  fire is too hot for a body to kneel over with these short straws. St.  John the Baptist, but the young man is adroit!\"    For, while he stated his difficulty, Gerard removed it. He untied in a  moment the knot on his breast, took his hat off, put a stone into each  corner of it, then, wrapping his hand in the tail of his jerkin, whipped  the flask off the fire, wedged it in between the stones, and put the  hat under the old man's nose with a merry smile. The other tremulously  inserted the pipe of rye-straw and sucked. Lo and behold, his wan, drawn  face was seen to light up more and more, till it quite glowed; and as  soon"]]]
