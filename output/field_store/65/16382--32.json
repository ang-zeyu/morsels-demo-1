[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#3)"],[1," often arouses the  reader's curiosity to know more of the persons, places, and  circumstances mentioned. In an effort to satisfy this curiosity, editors  of magazine sections print special feature stories based on news.    By anticipating approaching events, an editor is able to supply articles  that are timely for a particular issue of his paper. Two classes of  subjects that he usually looks forward to in this way are: first, those  concerned with local, state, and national anniversaries; and second,  those growing out of seasonal occasions, such as holidays, vacations,  the opening of schools and colleges, moving days, commencements, the  opening of hunting and fishing seasons.    The general policy of a newspaper with regard to special feature stories  is the same as its policy concerning news. Both are determined by the  character of its circulation. A paper that is read largely by business  and professional men provides news and special articles that satisfy  such readers. A paper that aims to reach the so-called masses naturally  selects news and features that will appeal to them. If a newspaper has a  considerable circulation outside the city where it is published, the  editors, in framing their policy, cannot afford to overlook their  suburban and rural readers. The character of its readers, in a word,  determines the character of a paper's special feature stories.    The newspaper is primarily local in character. A city, a state, or at  most a comparatively small section of the whole country, is its  particular field. Besides the news of its locality, it must, of course,  give significant news of the world at large. So, too, in addition to  local feature articles, it should furnish special feature stories of a  broader scope. This distinctively local character of newspapers  differentiates them from magazines of national circulation in the matter  of acceptable subjects for special articles.    The frequency of publication of newspapers, as well as their ephemeral  character, leads, in many instances, to the choice of comparatively  trivial topics for some articles. Merely to give readers entertaining  matter with which to occupy their leisure at the end of a day's work or  on Sunday, some papers print special feature stories on topics of little  or no importance, often written in a light vein. Articles with no more  serious purpose than that of helping readers to while away a few spare  moments are obviously better adapted to newspapers, which are read  rapidly and immediately cast aside, than to periodicals.    The sensationalism that characterizes the policy of some newspapers  affects alike their news columns and their magazine sections. Gossip,  scandal, and crime lend themselves to melodramatic treatment as readily  in special feature articles as in news stories. On the other hand, the  relatively few magazines that undertake to attract readers by  sensationalism, usually do so by means of short stories and serials  rather than by special articles.    All newspapers, in short, use special feature stories on local topics,  some papers print trivial ones, and others \"play up\" sensational  material; whereas practically no magazine publishes articles of these  types.    SUNDAY MAGAZINE SECTIONS. The character and scope of special articles  for the Sunday magazine section of newspapers have been well summarized  by two well-known editors of such sections. Mr. John O'Hara Cosgrove,  editor of the _New York Sunday World Magazine_, and formerly editor of  _Everybody's Magazine_, gives this as his conception of the ideal Sunday  magazine section:        The real function of the Sunday Magazine, to my thinking, is to      present the color and romance of the news, the most authoritative      opinions on the issues and events of the day, and to chronicle      promptly the developments of science as applied to daily life. In      the grind of human intercourse all manner of curious, heroic,      delightful things turn up, and for the most part, are dismissed in a      passing note. Behind every such episode are human beings and a      story, and these, if fairly and artfully explained, are the very      stuff of romance. Into every great city men are drifting daily from      the strange and remote places of the world where they have survived      perilous hazards and seen rare spectacles. Such adventures are the      treasure troves of the skilful reporter. The cross currents and      reactions that lead up to any explosion of greed or passion that we      call crime are often worth following, not only for their plots, but      as proofs of the pain and terror of transgression. Brave deeds or      heroic resistances are all too seldom presented in full length in      the news, and generously portrayed prove the nobility inherent in      every-day life.        The broad domain of the Sunday magazine editor covers all that may      be rare and curious or novel in the arts and sciences, in music and      verse, in religion and the occult, on the stage and in sport.      Achievements and controversies are ever culminating in these diverse      fields, and the men and women actors therein make admirable subjects      for his pages. Provided the editor has at his disposal skilled      writers who have the fine arts of vivid and simple exposition and of      the brief personal sketch, there is nothing of human interest that      may not be presented.    The ideal Sunday magazine, as Mr. Frederick Boyd Stevenson, Sunday  editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_, sees it, he describes thus:        The new Sunday magazine of the newspaper bids fair to be a crisp,      sensible review and critique of the live world. It has developed a      special line of writers who have learned that a character sketch and      interview of a man makes you \"see\" the man face to face and talk      with him yourself. If he has done anything that gives him a place in      the news of to-day, he is presented to you. You know the man.        It seems to me that the leading feature of the Sunday magazine      should be the biggest topic that will be before the public on the      Sunday that the newspaper is printed. It should be written by one      who thoroughly knows his subject, who is forceful in style and      fluent in words, who can make a picture that his readers can see,      and seeing, realize. So every other feature of the Sunday magazine      should have points of human interest, either by contact with the      news of the day or with men and women who are doing something      besides getting divorces and creating scandals.        I firmly believe that the coming Sunday magazine will contain      articles of information without being dull or encyclopaedic, articles      of adventure that are real and timely, articles of scientific      discoveries that are authentic, interviews with men and women who      have messages, and interpretations of news and analyses of every-day      themes, together with sketches, poems, and essays that are not      tedious, but have a reason for being printed.    THE MAGAZINE FIELD. The great majority of magazines differ from all  newspapers in one important respect--extent of circulation. Popular  magazines have a nation-wide distribution. It is only among agricultural  and trade journals that we find a distinctly sectional circulation. Some  of these publications serve subscribers in only one state or section,  and others issue separate state or sectional editions. The best basis of  differentiation among magazines, then, is not the extent of circulation  but the class of readers appealed to, regardless of the part of the  country in which the readers live. The popular general magazine, monthly  or weekly, aims to attract readers of all classes in all parts of the  United States.    HOW MAGAZINES GET MATERIAL. Magazine articles come from (1) regular  members of the magazine's staff, (2) professional or amateur free-lance  writers, (3) specialists who write as an avocation, and (4) readers of  the periodical who send in material based on their own experience.    The so-called \"staff system\" of magazine editing, in accordance with  which practically all the articles are prepared by writers regularly  employed by the publication, has been adopted by a few general magazines  and by a number of class periodicals. The staff is recruited from  writers and editors on newspapers and other magazines. Its members often  perform various editorial duties in addition to writing articles.  Publications edited in this way buy few if any articles from outsiders.    Magazines that do not follow the staff system depend largely or entirely  on contributors. Every editor daily receives many manuscripts submitted  by writers on their own initiative. From these he selects the material  best adapted to his publication. Experienced writers often submit an  outline of an article to a magazine editor for his approval before  preparing the material for publication. Free-lance writers of reputation  may be asked by magazine editors to prepare articles on given subjects.    In addition to material obtained in these ways, articles may be secured  from specialists who write as an avocation. An editor generally decides  on the subject that he thinks will interest his readers at a given time  and then selects the authority best fitted to treat it in a popular way.  To induce well-known men to prepare such articles, an editor generally  offers them more than he normally pays.    A periodical may encourage its readers to send in short articles giving  their own experiences and explaining how to do something in which they  have become skilled. These personal experience articles have a reality  and \"human interest\" that make them eminently readable. To obtain them  magazines sometimes offer prizes for the best, reserving the privilege  of publishing acceptable articles that do not win an award. Aspiring  writers should take advantage of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#3)"],[1,"houses, from the upper windows of which they could  hang in safety to watch the fight.    Disgusting?    Quite so!  But have you ever heard of bull-fighting or pigeon-shooting  in civilised, humane Europe?    There followed a frightful scene, during which Abdul, having picked up  the pigeon, hastily flung his birds far behind the growling, spitting,  raging couple, whilst the stallion, rearing in terror, nearly jerked  his master, who had the bridle slipped over his arm, off his feet.    The two dogs of Billi and the two greyhounds leapt and barked and  snapped at the belligerents until Wellington, taking an off-chance,  suddenly turned and bit one of them clean through the shoulder;  whereupon it yelped and howled and fled, whilst shouts of \"_Ma  sha-Allah_\" and much clapping came from the upper windows.    Damaris ran straight towards the man, who, slipping the bridle, put  both arms round her to draw her to safety; then, suddenly realising the  beauty, the youth and the pure whiteness of her, as suddenly let her go.    \"Shall I separate them?\" he asked simply.    \"No!  Not even if you could.  Once my dog's blood is up, nothing but  death will satisfy him.\"    She stood quite still, as white as a sheet, with both hands on his arm,  whilst the great dog hurled himself at the spitting brute, only to meet  the teeth and claws which drew blood at every attempt, until the ground  was crimson where they fought.    And then, with tears streaming down her cheeks, Damaris looked up into  the man's face; then buried her face on his shoulder.    And the seed of love which is in the heart of every human burst  through, the clogging mould of custom and convention and, taking root,  put forth shoots and sprang in one moment into the great tree of love  of which the fruits, being those of purity, honour and sacrifice, are  golden.    Yet he did not touch her, having learned his lesson; instead, he raised  his right hand above his head.    \"Allah!\" he said, in praise of that which had come unto him, \"Allah,  there is no God but Thee,\" just as, with a sudden swish, a flock of  startled pigeons flashing like jewels in the setting sun new low down  across his head, bringing an end to the battle.    For one half-second the jaguar's green eyes shifted, and the dog was at  its throat.  There was a mighty, convulsive effort of the hind-legs  which ripped the bulldog's sides, a click, a shiver, and the black  brute fell dead, as the dog, a mass of blood, foam and pride, hurled  himself onto the skirt of his beloved mistress, whilst the enraptured  spectators, yelling with excitement, rushed out into the square with  shouts of \"_Ma sha-Allah_,\" which means, \"Well done, well done!\"    \"Keep quite still,\" said Hugh Carden Ali, gently, as Damaris made an  effort to turn; then, speaking quickly to the beaming, salaaming  spectators, who had had the time of their lives gambling on the chances  of either animal, ordered them to remove the dead beast and to strew  the place with sand.  And \"_Irja Sooltan_,\" he called to the stallion,  which, terrified at the sounds and sight and smell of battle, had  bolted up a side street, where he stood fretting and fidgeting himself  into a fine sweat, until he heard the clear call which could always  bring him back to the man he loved.  He stood for one second, then  flung up his heels to the devastation of a stall of earthenware, and  raced back to the square at a most unseemly pace, causing the  spectators once more to fly in all directions with cries of \"U'a u'a,\"  which means, \"Look out, look out!\"    He pushed his soft nose with determination against the woman who stood  so close to his master, so that she looked up, and then smiled and  stretched out her arms.    \"You beauty!\" she cried.  \"Oh, you _beauty_!\"    \"You ride?\"    Damaris, thinking of the hack, the only thing with the shape of a horse  she had been able to get so far, and upon the back of which she loathed  to be seen, made a grimace.    \"I go out on horseback,\" she said.  \"I have not ridden since I left  home.\"    The man's reply, whatever it might have been, was interrupted by Abdul,  who, all smiles, stood before them, with the white pigeon in the left  hand and the _shahin_ upon his right fist.    The native had no intention of causing the white woman pain; in fact,  wishing to find favour in the eyes of the nobles, he only wanted to  give them a chance of witnessing a little of, to him, the finest sport  in the world.    \"Look, lady!\" he cried.    He tossed the pigeon high into the air, allowed her a little distance,  then threw the hawk.    \"No!  Oh, no! don't!\" cried Damaris, as the hawk rose, \"stooped\" and  missed the pigeon by a hair's-breadth as it \"put in\", which means that  it flew straight into a small niche of a minaret for cover.    \"Ah!\" cried Damaris, and \"_Bi-sma-llah_!\" ejaculated Abdul, as he threw  the lure of a dead plover and called his hawk with the luring Eastern  call.  \"Coo-coo,\" he called; \"coo-coo,\" to which the hawk responded as  a well-trained _shahin_ should.    Hugh Carden Ali stood with his hand on the stallion's mane, looking up  at the sky, in which shone a great star.    \"The hawk of Egypt failed,\" he said to himself.  \"Flown at a white  bird, it failed.  The House of Allah, who is God, gave sanctuary to the  little white bird.  Praise be to Allah who is God.\"    He looked down at the girl, who was kneeling, consoling the dog, who,  reft 'tween pride and pain, showed a lamentable countenance.  Suddenly  she looked up and rose, and stood silently.    \"Come,\" he said simply, while he longed to pick her up and ride with  her to his home in the Oasis.  \"I will take you to your hotel.\"    \"My car is waiting for me in the Sikket el-Gedideh,\" she replied.         *     *     *     *     *    Later, a vision of loveliness, she walked down the dining-room behind  the Duchess of Longacres, whilst continuous lamentations were wafted  through the spring-doors from the spot where sat a dog with  sticking-plaster across his nose and middle girt with a cummerbund of  pink boracic lint.    Beside the girl's place lay a huge bunch of crimson roses tied with  golden tassels; there was no card, name nor message.    She asked no question, neither did her godmother.    To what purpose should they?  The one _knew_; the other firmly believed  in allowing the young to work out the salvation of their own souls;  which did not, however, mean that she would not keep a sharp look-out  in the future over the troubled sea of Life.    \"I knew something would happen,\" thought the wise old lady, as she  passed a biscuit up to the parrot on her shoulder.    \"_Kathir Khairak_,\" it said delightedly.    It merely means \"thank you,\" but had taken weeks of teaching and  repeating to master.          CHAPTER III      \"Lor! but women's rum cattle to deal with, the      first man found that to his cost;    And I reckon it's just through a woman, that the      last man on earth'll be lost.\"              G. R. SIMS.      Damaris was the only daughter of Squire Hethencourt.  Her mother was an  Italian from the Udino, where the hair of the women is genuine  Titian-red and the eyes are blue; which perhaps accounted for her  colouring and some part of her temperament.    Her type of beauty was certainly remarkable--given, it must be  confessed, to a certain amount of fluctuation--and she danced divinely,  which gift must not be counted as a parlour-trick; she was slow in her  movements and quiet in her manner until she talked of horses or anybody  she loved; then her great eyes would flash and her laugh ring out, also  she would gesticulate as her mother had been wont to do, until the  climate, maybe, of a northern country had served to repress the  spontaneity of her Latin mannerisms.    She was simple and unsophisticated and would have made a splendid  little chum, if only one out of every three men who met her had not  been consumed with a desire to annex her for life by means of a gold  ring.    \"Dads,\" she exclaimed, two months before the beginning of this story,  having enticed him to her bedroom one night and offered him cream  chocolates as he eat at the foot of her bed, facing her.  \"Dads, what  am I to do?  Guy Danvers says he is coming to see you to-morrow, and  I--I am sure it will only turn out to be--well--you, know.\"    \"But, Golliwog dear, I'm the one to be pitied.  This makes the--how  many is it?\"    \"I don't know, Dads, and it isn't the number; it's the awful _habit_  they've got into--and I don't understand anything and I don't encourage  them, do I?  Do lend me a hankie--this chocolate has burst--and what am  I to do?\"    \"Turn a deaf ear, or a cold shoulder, or put a brave face on,  until------\" said Dads, retrieving his handkerchief.    \"Until what?\"    \"Until the right man comes along, darling, as he surely will.\"    The girl's lids suddenly dropped until the lashes lay like a fringe  upon the white cheek over which very slowly but very surely crept the  faintest of rose-colours.    \"Hum!\" said Dads to himself, as he made great use of the hankie.    \"Do smoke, dearest!\"    \"No, thank you, pet; I couldn't here.\"    The man who worshipped his wife and adored his little daughter looked  round the white and somewhat austere room, and ran his eye over the  bookstand at his elbow.    Books on horses, a treatise on bulldogs, the New Testament, essays in  French and in German, the History of Egypt in Arabic, Budge's \"Book of  the Dead,\" and \"King Solomon's Mines.\"    \"But what am I do _meanwhile_, Dads?\" and the girl threw out her hands  imploringly.    \"Be cold, deaf or brave, Golliwog, as I have suggested.\"    \"But I've been all that, and it's quite useless.  Do you think it would  help if I let my hair grow and did it up in a tight knob?\"    \"I think it would help a lot if you shaved your head entirely, kiddie.\"  And the man leant forward and ran his hand through the red curls.
