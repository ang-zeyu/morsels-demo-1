In order to obtain this, in most cases, not very important truth,  he sacrifices the light and colour of five-sixths of his picture; and the  expression of every character of objects which depends on tenderness of  shape or tint. But he obtains his single truth, and what picturesque and  forcible expression is dependent upon it, with magnificent skill and  subtlety.    \"... His love of darkness led also to a loss of the spiritual element, and  was itself the reflection of a sombre mind....    \"... I cannot feel it an entirely glorious speciality to be distinguished,  as Rembrandt was, from other great painters, chiefly by the liveliness of  his darkness and the dulness of his light. Glorious or inglorious, the  speciality itself is easily and accurately definable. It is the aim of the  best painters to paint the noblest things they can see by sunlight. It was  the aim of Rembrandt to paint the foulest things he could see--by  rushlight....\"    Had Ruskin, one wonders, ever seen _The Syndics_ at Amsterdam, or the  _Portrait of his Mother_, and the _Singing Boy_ at Vienna, or _The Old  Woman_ at St. Petersburg, or the _Christ at Emmaus_ at the Louvre, or any  of the etchings?    The time came when the child was allowed to visit the National Gallery  unattended; but although he never lost his affectionate awe for the two dim  interiors, he did not really begin to appreciate Rembrandt until he had  reached manhood. Rembrandt is too learned in the pathos of life, too deeply  versed in realities, to win the suffrages of youth. But he was attracted by  another portrait in the National Gallery--that called _A Jewish Rabbi_.  This was the first likeness he had seen of a Rabbi, a personality dimly  familiar to him through the lessons in church and his school Scripture  class. Remembering what his mother had told him about _chiaroscuro_, he  noted how the golden-brown light is centred upon the lower part of the  face; how the forehead is in shadow, and how stealthily the black hat and  coat creep out from the dark background. He had never seen, and never could  have imagined, such a sad face. This Rabbi seemed to be crouching into the  picture as he dimly understood that Jews in all ages, except those who  owned diamond mines in South Africa, had cringed under the hand of their  oppressors.    He wondered how Rembrandt knew what a Rabbi was like. His father might have  told him that Rembrandt's pencil and brush were never idle, that he was for  ever making pictures of himself, of his father, of his mother, of his wife,  of his children and relations, of every interesting type that came within  the ken of his piercing eyes; that one day, when he was prowling about the  Jews' quarter at Amsterdam, he saw an old, tired, wistful Hebrew sitting in  the door of his shop, engaged him in conversation, persuaded him to sit for  his portrait, and lo! the nameless Amsterdam Jew became immortal.    [Illustration: AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD, SEATED, WEARING A WIDE  CAP, HIS HANDS FOLDED    1654. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    His father might also have told him (perhaps he did) that the artist,  wherever he goes, sometimes hardly aware of his preoccupation, is always  selecting subjects to paint, and brooding over the method of treatment;  that one day Rembrandt noted with amusement a man in the street shaking his  fist at the skull-capped head of an older man bobbing angrily from a  window. Rembrandt chuckled, remembered the incident, painted it, and  called it, for a picture must have a title, _Samson threatening his  Father-in-law_; that one day Rembrandt saw a fair-haired, chubby boy  learning his lessons at his mother's knee. The composition appealed to his  artist eye, he painted it, and the result is that beautiful and touching  picture in the Hermitage Gallery at St. Petersburg called _Hannah teaching  Samuel his Lessons_.    To a child, the portrait of a painter by himself has a human interest apart  altogether from its claim to be a work of art. Rembrandt's portrait of  himself at the National Gallery, painted when he was thirty-two, is not one  of his remarkable achievements. It is a little timid in the handling, but  that it is an excellent likeness none can doubt. This bold-eyed, quietly  observant, jolly-looking man was not quite the presentment of Rembrandt  that the child had imagined; but Rembrandt at this period was something of  a sumptuous dandy, proud of his brave looks and his fur-trimmed mantle.  Life was his province. No subject was vulgar to him so long as it presented  problems of light and construction and drawing. Rembrandt, like Montaigne,  was never didactic. He looked at life through his eyes and through his  imagination, and related his adventures. One day it was a flayed ox hanging  outside a butcher's shop, which he saw through his eyes; another day it was  Christ healing the sick, which he saw through his imagination. You can  imagine the healthy, full-blooded Rembrandt of this portrait painting the  _Carcase of a Bullock_ at the Louvre, or that prank called _The Rape of  Ganymede_, or that delightful, laughing picture of his wife sitting upon  his knee at Dresden, which Ruskin disliked.    The other portrait of Rembrandt by himself at the National Gallery shows  that he was not a vain man, and that he was just as honest with himself as  with his other sitters. It was painted when he was old and ailing and  time-marked, five years before his death. His hands are clasped, and he  seems to be saying--\"Look at me! That is what I am like now, an old, much  bothered man, bankrupt, without a home, but happy enough so long as I have  some sort of a roof above me under which I can paint. I am he of whom it  was said that he was famous when he was beardless. Observe me now! What  care I so that I can still see the world and the men and women about  me--'When I want rest for my mind, it is not honours I crave, but  liberty.'\"    [Illustration: REMBRANDT LEANING ON A STONE SILL    1640. National Gallery, London.]    Twenty-eight seemed a great age to the child; but he thought it wonderful  that the portrait of an _Old Lady_ at the National Gallery should have been  painted when Rembrandt was but twenty-eight. She was too strong and  determined for his liking, and he wondered why some of Rembrandt's  pictures, like _The Woman taken in Adultery_, should be so mysterious and  poetical, and others like this old lady so lifelike and straightforward. He  was too young to understand that the composition of the fortuitous  concourse of atoms called Rembrandt, included not only the power that  Velasquez possessed in so supreme a degree of painting just what his eyes  saw, exemplified by this portrait of _An Old Lady_, aged 83, and by the  portrait of _Elizabeth Bas_ at Amsterdam, but that it also included the  great gift of creative imagination, exemplified by the _Christ at Emmaus_,  and _The Good Samaritan_ of the Louvre, and in a way by the _Portrait of a  Slav Prince_ at the Hermitage, where a man in the alembic of Rembrandt's  imagination has become a type. Also in _The Reconciliation of David and  Absalom_ at the Hermitage, where behind the sham trappings of the figures  shine the eternal motives of reconciliation and forgiveness.    When the child was much older he saw the _Christ at Emmaus_, and _The Good  Samaritan_ in the little room at the Louvre, hanging side by side, and he  never forget the hour that he spent with them. He had seen, year by year,  many of the world's pictures; but at the sight of these two works, his  childish predilection for Rembrandt became a deep-rooted reverence and  admiration, which was never to pass from him.    Here was Rembrandt the seer, the man who had suffered. Saskia was dead,  his popularity gone; but the effect of these things was but to fill his  heart with a world sympathy, with pity for all who sorrow. Again and again  he treated the _Christ at Emmaus_, _The Good Samaritan_, and _The Prodigal  Son_ themes. \"Some strange presentment of his own fate,\" says M. Michel,  \"seems to have haunted the artist, making him keenly susceptible to the  story of _The Good Samaritan_. He too was destined to be stripped and  wounded by Life's wayside, while many passed him by unheeding.\"    The _Christ at Emmaus_ is a small picture, and small the figures appear in  that vast, dimly lighted chamber where the three are seated at table. The  spiritual significance of Christ is suggested by most simple means. Light,  and intensity of emotion, are the only aids. Rembrandt disdains all other  effects. Intense feeling pervades the picture, even in the bare feet of  Christ, even in the astonished hand of the disciple resting upon the chair;  even in the back of the other disciple who gazes, with clasped hands,  transfixed with amazement and love at the face of his Master, who has just  broken bread and thus revealed Himself.    [Illustration: RECONCILIATION BETWEEN DAVID AND ABSALOM    1642. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    Of all Rembrandt's pictures, this was the one that made the profoundest  impression upon the child when he had become a man. Other works, such as  _The Shipbuilder and his Wife_ at Buckingham Palace, _The Syndics of the  Drapers_ at Amsterdam, that ripe expression of Rembrandt's ripest powers,  convinced him of the master's genius. He was deeply impressed by the range  of portraits and subject-pictures at the Hermitage Gallery, many of which,  by the art of Mr. Mortimer Menpes, have been brought to the fireside of the  untravelled; but the _Christ at Emmaus_ revealed to him the heart of  Rembrandt, and showed him, once and for all, to what heights a painter may  attain when intense feeling is allied with superb craftsmanship.    He found this intensity of emotion again in the _Portrait of his Mother_ at  Vienna."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#3)"],[1,"another,\" i.e.: Whatever you lack of  good things, expect it of Me, and look to Me for it, and whenever you  suffer misfortune and distress, creep and cling to Me. I, yes, I, will  give you enough and help you out of every need; only let not your heart  cleave to or rest in any other.    This I must unfold somewhat more plainly, that it may be understood and  perceived by ordinary examples of the contrary. Many a one thinks that  he has God and everything in abundance when he has money and  possessions; he trusts in them and boasts of them with such firmness  and assurance as to care for no one. Lo, such a man also has a god,  Mammon by name, i.e., money and possessions, on which he sets all his  heart, and which is also the most common idol on earth. He who has  money and possessions feels secure, and is joyful and undismayed as  though he were sitting in the midst of Paradise. On the other hand, he  who has none doubts and is despondent, as though he knew of no God. For  very few are to be found who are of good cheer, and who neither mourn  nor complain if they have not Mammon. This [care and desire for money]  sticks and clings to our nature, even to the grave.    So, too, whoever trusts and boasts that he possesses great skill,  prudence, power, favor friendship, and honor has also a god, but not  this true and only God. This appears again when you notice how  presumptuous, secure, and proud people are because of such  possessions, and how despondent when they no longer exist or are  withdrawn. Therefore I repeat that the chief explanation of this point  is that to have a god is to have something in which the heart entirely  trusts.    Besides, consider what in our blindness, we have hitherto been  practicing and doing under the Papacy. If any one had toothache, he  fasted and honored St. Apollonia [lacerated his flesh by voluntary  fasting to the honor of St. Apollonia]; if he was afraid of fire, he  chose St. Lawrence as his helper in need; if he dreaded pestilence, he  made a vow to St. Sebastian or Rochio, and a countless number of such  abominations, where every one selected his own saint, worshiped him,  and called for help to him in distress. Here belong those also, as,  e.g., sorcerers and magicians, whose idolatry is most gross, and who  make a covenant with the devil, in order that he may give them plenty  of money or help them in love-affairs, preserve their cattle, restore  to them lost possessions, etc. For all these place their heart and  trust elsewhere than in the true God, look for nothing good to Him nor  seek it from Him.    Thus you can easily understand what and how much this commandment  requires, namely, that man's entire heart and all his confidence be  placed in God alone, and in no one else. For to have God, you can  easily perceive, is not to lay hold of Him with our hands or to put Him  in a bag [as money], or to lock Him in a chest [as silver vessels]. But  to apprehend Him means when the heart lays hold of Him and clings to  Him. But to cling to Him with the heart is nothing else than to trust  in Him entirely. For this reason He wishes to turn us away from  everything else that exists outside of Him, and to draw us to Himself,  namely, because He is the only eternal good. As though He would say:  Whatever you have heretofore sought of the saints, or for whatever  [things] you have trusted in Mammon or anything else, expect it all of  Me, and regard Me as the one who will help you and pour out upon you  richly all good things.    Lo, here you have the meaning of the true honor and worship of God,  which pleases God, and which He commands under penalty of eternal  wrath, namely, that the heart know no other comfort or confidence than  in Him, and do not suffer itself to be torn from Him, but, for Him,  risk and disregard everything upon earth. On the other hand, you can  easily see and judge how the world practices only false worship and  idolatry. For no people has ever been so reprobate as not to institute  and observe some divine worship; every one has set up as his special  god whatever he looked to for blessings, help, and comfort.    Thus, for example, the heathen who put their trust in power and  dominion elevated Jupiter as the supreme god; the others, who were bent  upon riches, happiness, or pleasure, and a life of ease, Hercules,  Mercury, Venus or others; women with child, Diana or Lucina, and so on;  thus every one made that his god to which his heart was inclined, so  that even in the mind of the heathen to have a god means to trust and  believe. But their error is this that their trust is false and wrong  for it is not placed in the only God, besides whom there is truly no  God in heaven or upon earth. Therefore the heathen really make their  self-invented notions and dreams of God an idol, and put their trust in  that which is altogether nothing. Thus it is with all idolatry; for it  consists not merely in erecting an image and worshiping it, but rather  in the heart, which stands gaping at something else, and seeks help and  consolation from creatures saints, or devils, and neither cares for  God, nor looks to Him for so much good as to believe that He is willing  to help, neither believes that whatever good it experiences comes from  God.    Besides, there is also a false worship and extreme idolatry, which we  have hitherto practiced, and is still prevalent in the world, upon  which also all ecclesiastical orders are founded, and which concerns  the conscience alone that seeks in its own works help, consolation, and  salvation, presumes to wrest heaven from God, and reckons how many  bequests it has made, how often it has fasted, celebrated Mass, etc.  Upon such things it depends, and of them boasts, as though unwilling to  receive anything from God as a gift, but desires itself to earn or  merit it superabundantly, just as though He must serve us and were our  debtor, and we His liege lords. What is this but reducing God to an  idol, yea, [a fig image or] an apple-god, and elevating and regarding  ourselves as God ? But this is slightly too subtle, and is not for  young pupils.    But let this be said to the simple, that they may well note and  remember the meaning of this commandment, namely, that we are to trust  in God alone, and look to Him and expect from Him naught but good, as  from one who gives us body, life, food, drink, nourishment, health,  protection, peace, and all necessaries of both temporal and eternal  things. He also preserves us from misfortune, and if any evil befall  us, delivers and rescues us, so that it is God alone (as has been  sufficiently said) from whom we receive all good, and by whom we are  delivered from all evil. Hence also, I think, we Germans from ancient  times call God (more elegantly and appropriately than any other  language) by that name from the word good as being an eternal fountain  which gushes forth abundantly nothing but what is good, and from which  flows forth all that is and is called good.    For even though otherwise we experience much good from men, still  whatever we receive by His command or arrangement is all received from  God. For our parents, and all rulers, and every one besides with  respect to his neighbor, have received from God the command that they  should do us all manner of good, so that we receive these blessings not  from them, but, through them, from God. For creatures are only the  hands, channels, and means whereby God gives all things, as He gives to  the mother breasts and milk to offer to her child, and corn and all  manner of produce from the earth for nourishment, none of which  blessings could be produced by any creature of itself.    Therefore no man should presume to take or give anything except as God  has commanded, in order that it may be acknowledged as God's gift, and  thanks may be rendered Him for it, as this commandment requires. On  this account also these means of receiving good gifts through creatures  are not to be rejected, neither should we in presumption seek other  ways and means than God has commanded. For that would not be receiving  from God, hut seeking of ourselves.    Let every one, then, see to it that he esteem this commandment great  and high above all things, and do not regard it as a joke. Ask and  examine your heart diligently, and you will find whether it cleaves to  God alone or not. If you have a heart that can expect of Him nothing  but what is good, especially in want and distress, and that, moreover  renounces and forsakes everything that is not God, then you have the  only true God. If on the contrary, it cleaves to anything else, of  which it expects more good and help than of God, and does not take  refuge in Him, but in adversity flees from Him, then you have an idol,  another god.    In order that it may be seen that God will not have this commandment  thrown to the winds, but will most strictly enforce it, He has attached  to it first a terrible threat, and then a beautiful, comforting promise  which is also to be urged and impressed upon young people, that they  may take it to heart and retain it:    [Exposition of the Appendix to the First Commandment.]      For I am the Lord, thy God, strong and jealous, visiting the iniquity  of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation  of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that  love Me and keep My commandments.    Although these words relate to all the commandments (as we shall  hereafter learn), yet they are joined to this chief commandment  because it is of first importance that men have a right head; for  where the head is right, the whole life must be right, and vice versa.  Learn, therefore, from these words how angry God is with those who  trust in anything but Him, and again, how good and gracious He is to  those who trust and believe in Him alone with the whole heart; so that  His anger does not cease until the fourth generation, while, on"]]]
