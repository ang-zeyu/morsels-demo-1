The Synopsis and Codification covered the  text of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which  constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of  Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English  translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible  and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan  1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in  other languages.    It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture,  should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration,  uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in  scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow  of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been  added--such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature--and  these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing,  as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the  work will be published.    Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of  Baha'u'llah which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a  translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first  time.    Shoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas should  be \"copiously annotated\". The policy followed in preparing the notes has  been to concentrate on those points which might strike a  non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various reasons,  require elucidation or background information. They are not intended to be  a comprehensive commentary on the text beyond these fundamental  requirements.    The notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification, are  numbered sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the passage to  which it relates, and indicates the number of the paragraph in which this  appears. This facilitates cross-reference between the text and the notes,  while making it possible for readers to study the notes without repeatedly  consulting the text, if they so prefer. It is hoped in this way to meet  the needs of readers of a wide range of backgrounds and interests.    The index provides a guide to subjects in all sections of the volume.    The significance and character of the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the range of  subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi in  his history of the first Baha'i century entitled God Passes By. As an  assistance to the reader, these passages are provided in the section that  immediately follows the introduction. The Synopsis and Codification, which  is republished in this volume, serves as another aid for obtaining an  overview of the Book.            INTRODUCTION      This year, the 149th of the Baha'i era, marks the Centenary of the  Ascension of Baha'u'llah, Bearer of the universal Revelation of God  destined to lead humanity to its collective coming of age. That this  occasion should be observed by a community of believers representing a  cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course of a  century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is a token of  the forces of unity released by Baha'u'llah's advent. A further testimony  to the operation of these same forces can be seen in the extent to which  Baha'u'llah's vision has prefigured contemporary human experience in so  many of its aspects. It is a propitious moment for the publication of this  first authorized translation into English of the Mother Book of His  Revelation, His \"Most Holy Book\", the Book in which He sets forth the Laws  of God for a Dispensation destined to endure for no less than a thousand  years.    Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings of  Baha'u'llah, the Kitab-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. \"To build anew the  whole world\" is the claim and challenge of His Message, and the  Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future world civilization that  Baha'u'llah has come to raise up. Its provisions rest squarely on the  foundation established by past religions, for, in the words of  Baha'u'llah, \"This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past,  eternal in the future.\" In this Revelation the concepts of the past are  brought to a new level of understanding, and the social laws, changed to  suit the age now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a  world civilization the splendours of which can as yet be scarcely  imagined.    In its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the past, the  Kitab-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated by all the Divine  Messengers: the unity of God, love of one's neighbour, and the moral  purpose of earthly life. At the same time it removes those elements of  past religious codes that now constitute obstacles to the emerging  unification of the world and the reconstruction of human society.    The Law of God for this Dispensation addresses the needs of the entire  human family. There are laws in the Kitab-i-Aqdas which are directed  primarily to the members of a specific section of humanity and can be  immediately understood by them but which, at first reading, may be obscure  to people of a different culture. Such, for example, is the law  prohibiting the confession of sins to a fellow human being which, though  understandable by those of Christian background, may puzzle others. Many  laws relate to those of past Dispensations, especially the two most recent  ones, those of Muhammad and the Bab embodied in the Qur'an and the Bayan.  Nevertheless, although certain ordinances of the Aqdas have such a focused  reference, they also have universal implications. Through His Law,  Baha'u'llah gradually unveils the significance of the new levels of  knowledge and behaviour to which the peoples of the world are being  called. He embeds His precepts in a setting of spiritual commentary,  keeping ever before the mind of the reader the principle that these laws,  no matter the subject with which they deal, serve the manifold purposes of  bringing tranquillity to human society, raising the standard of human  behaviour, increasing the range of human understanding, and spiritualizing  the life of each and all. Throughout, it is the relationship of the  individual soul to God and the fulfilment of its spiritual destiny that is  the ultimate aim of the laws of religion. \"Think not\", is Baha'u'llah's  own assertion, \"that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay,  rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and  power.\" His Book of Laws is His \"weightiest testimony unto all people, and  the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are  on earth\".    An introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the Kitab-i-Aqdas  would fail in its purpose if it did not acquaint the reader with the  interpretive and legislative institutions that Baha'u'llah has  indissolubly linked with the system of law thus revealed. At the  foundation of this guidance lies the unique role which Baha'u'llah's  Writings--indeed the text of the Kitab-i-Aqdas itself--confer on His eldest  son, 'Abdu'l-Baha. This unique figure is at once the Exemplar of the  pattern of life taught by His Father, the divinely inspired authoritative  Interpreter of His Teachings and the Centre and Pivot of the Covenant  which the Author of the Baha'i Revelation made with all who recognize Him.  The twenty-nine years of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry endowed the Baha'i world  with a luminous body of commentary that opens multiple vistas of  understanding on His Father's purpose.    In His Will and Testament 'Abdu'l-Baha conferred the mantle of Guardian of  the Cause and infallible Interpreter of its teachings upon His eldest  grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and confirmed the authority and guarantee of  divine guidance decreed by Baha'u'llah for the Universal House of Justice  on all matters \"which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book\". The  Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in  the words of Shoghi Effendi, the \"Twin Successors\" of Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha. They are the supreme institutions of the Administrative  Order which was founded and anticipated in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and  elaborated by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will.    During the thirty-six years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi raised up the  structure of elected Spiritual Assemblies--the Houses of Justice referred  to in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, now in their embryonic stage--and with their  collaboration initiated the systematic implementation of the Divine Plan  that 'Abdu'l-Baha had laid out for the diffusion of the Faith throughout  the world. He also set in motion, on the basis of the strong  administrative structure that had been established, the processes which  were an essential preparation for the election of the Universal House of  Justice. This body, which came into existence in April 1963, is elected  through secret ballot and plurality vote in a three-stage election by  adult Baha'is throughout the world. The revealed Word of Baha'u'llah,  together with the interpretations and expositions of the Centre of the  Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause, constitute the binding terms of  reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock  foundation.    As to the laws themselves, a careful scrutiny discloses that they govern  three areas: the individual's relationship to God, physical and spiritual  matters which benefit the individual directly, and relations among  individuals and between the individual and society. They can be grouped  under the following headings: prayer and fasting; laws of personal status  governing marriage, divorce and inheritance; a range of other laws,  ordinances and prohibitions, as well as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#3)"],[1,"--An apparently impregnable position    --Spingawi route decided on--Disposition of the force    --A night attack--Advantages of a night attack    --Devotion of my orderlies    --Threatening the enemy's rear--The Peiwar Kotal    CHAPTER XLVII.
