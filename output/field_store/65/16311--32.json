I have an old, brown carved box; the lid is broken and tied with a  string. In it I keep little squares of paper, with hair inside, and a  little picture which hung over my brother's bed when we were children,  and other things as small. I have in it a rose. Other women also have  such boxes where they keep such trifles, but no one has my rose.    When my eye is dim, and my heart grows faint, and my faith in woman  flickers, and her present is an agony to me, and her future a despair,  the scent of that dead rose, withered for twelve years, comes back to  me. I know there will be spring; as surely as the birds know it when  they see above the snow two tiny, quivering green leaves. Spring cannot  fail us.    There were other flowers in the box once; a bunch of white acacia  flowers, gathered by the strong hand of a man, as we passed down a  village street on a sultry afternoon, when it had rained, and the drops  fell on us from the leaves of the acacia trees. The flowers were damp;  they made mildew marks on the paper I folded them in. After many years  I threw them away. There is nothing of them left in the box now, but  a faint, strong smell of dried acacia, that recalls that sultry summer  afternoon; but the rose is in the box still.    It is many years ago now; I was a girl of fifteen, and I went to visit  in a small up-country town. It was young in those days, and two days'  journey from the nearest village; the population consisted mainly of  men. A few were married, and had their wives and children, but most were  single. There was only one young girl there when I came. She was about  seventeen, fair, and rather fully-fleshed; she had large dreamy blue  eyes, and wavy light hair; full, rather heavy lips, until she smiled;  then her face broke into dimples, and all her white teeth shone. The  hotel-keeper may have had a daughter, and the farmer in the outskirts  had two, but we never saw them. She reigned alone. All the men  worshipped her. She was the only woman they had to think of. They talked  of her on the stoep, at the market, at the hotel; they watched for her  at street corners; they hated the man she bowed to or walked with down  the street. They brought flowers to the front door; they offered her  their horses; they begged her to marry them when they dared. Partly,  there was something noble and heroic in this devotion of men to the best  woman they knew; partly there was something natural in it, that these  men, shut off from the world, should pour at the feet of one woman the  worship that otherwise would have been given to twenty; and partly there  was something mean in their envy of one another. If she had raised her  little finger, I suppose, she might have married any one out of twenty  of them.    Then I came. I do not think I was prettier; I do not think I was so  pretty as she was. I was certainly not as handsome. But I was vital, and  I was new, and she was old--they all forsook her and followed me. They  worshipped me. It was to my door that the flowers came; it was I had  twenty horses offered me when I could only ride one; it was for me they  waited at street corners; it was what I said and did that they talked  of. Partly I liked it. I had lived alone all my life; no one ever had  told me I was beautiful and a woman. I believed them. I did not know  it was simply a fashion, which one man had set and the rest followed  unreasoningly. I liked them to ask me to marry them, and to say, No.  I despised them. The mother heart had not swelled in me yet; I did not  know all men were my children, as the large woman knows when her heart  is grown. I was too small to be tender. I liked my power. I was like  a child with a new whip, which it goes about cracking everywhere, not  caring against what. I could not wind it up and put it away. Men were  curious creatures, who liked me, I could never tell why. Only one thing  took from my pleasure; I could not bear that they had deserted her for  me. I liked her great dreamy blue eyes, I liked her slow walk and drawl;  when I saw her sitting among men, she seemed to me much too good to be  among them; I would have given all their compliments if she would once  have smiled at me as she smiled at them, with all her face breaking into  radiance, with her dimples and flashing teeth. But I knew it never  could be; I felt sure she hated me; that she wished I was dead; that she  wished I had never come to the village. She did not know, when we went  out riding, and a man who had always ridden beside her came to ride  beside me, that I sent him away; that once when a man thought to win  my favour by ridiculing her slow drawl before me I turned on him so  fiercely that he never dared come before me again. I knew she knew that  at the hotel men had made a bet as to which was the prettier, she or I,  and had asked each man who came in, and that the one who had staked on  me won. I hated them for it, but I would not let her see that I cared  about what she felt towards me.    She and I never spoke to each other.    If we met in the village street we bowed and passed on; when we shook  hands we did so silently, and did not look at each other. But I thought  she felt my presence in a room just as I felt hers.    At last the time for my going came. I was to leave the next day. Some  one I knew gave a party in my honour, to which all the village was  invited.    It was midwinter. There was nothing in the gardens but a few dahlias and  chrysanthemums, and I suppose that for two hundred miles round there  was not a rose to be bought for love or money. Only in the garden of a  friend of mine, in a sunny corner between the oven and the brick wall,  there was a rose tree growing which had on it one bud. It was white, and  it had been promised to the fair haired girl to wear at the party.    The evening came; when I arrived and went to the waiting-room, to take  off my mantle, I found the girl there already. She was dressed in pure  white, with her great white arms and shoulders showing, and her bright  hair glittering in the candle-light, and the white rose fastened at her  breast. She looked like a queen. I said \"Good-evening,\" and turned away  quickly to the glass to arrange my old black scarf across my old black  dress.    Then I felt a hand touch my hair.    \"Stand still,\" she said.    I looked in the glass. She had taken the white rose from her breast, and  was fastening it in my hair.    \"How nice dark hair is; it sets off flowers so.\" She stepped back and  looked at me. \"It looks much better there!\"    I turned round.    \"You are so beautiful to me,\" I said.    \"Y-e-s,\" she said, with her slow Colonial drawl; \"I'm so glad.\"    We stood looking at each other.    Then they came in and swept us away to dance. All the evening we did not  come near to each other. Only once, as she passed, she smiled at me.    The next morning I left the town.    I never saw her again.    Years afterwards I heard she had married and gone to America; it may or  may not be so--but the rose--the rose is in the box still! When my faith  in woman grows dim, and it seems that for want of love and magnanimity  she can play no part in any future heaven; then the scent of that small  withered thing comes back:--spring cannot fail us.

A woman sat at her desk in the corner of a room; behind her a fire burnt  brightly.    Presently a servant came in and gave her a card.    \"Say I am busy and can see no one now. I have to finish this article by  two o'clock.\"    The servant came back. The caller said she would only keep her a moment:  it was necessary she should see her.    The woman rose from her desk. \"Tell the boy to wait. Ask the lady to  come in.\"    A young woman in a silk dress, with a cloak reaching to her feet,  entered. She was tall and slight, with fair hair.    \"I knew you would not mind. I wished to see you so!\"    The woman offered her a seat by the fire. \"May I loosen your cloak?--the  room is warm.\"    \"I wanted so to come and see you. You are the only person in the world  who could help me! I know you are so large, and generous, and kind to  other women!\" She sat down. Tears stood in her large blue eyes: she was  pulling off her little gloves unconsciously.    \"You know Mr.--\" (she mentioned the name of a well-known writer): \"I  know you meet him often in your work. I want you to do something for  me!\"    The woman on the hearth-rug looked down at her.    \"I couldn't tell my father or my mother, or any one else; but I can tell  you, though I know so little of you. You know, last summer he came and  stayed with us a month. I saw a great deal of him. I don't know if he  liked me; I know he liked my singing, and we rode together--I liked him  more than any man I have ever seen. Oh, you know it isn't true that a  woman can only like a man when he likes her; and I thought, perhaps, he  liked me a little. Since we have been in town we have asked, but he has  never come to see us. Perhaps people have been saying something to him  about me. You know him, you are always meeting him, couldn't you say  or do anything for me?\" She looked up with her lips white and drawn.  \"I feel sometimes as if I were going mad! Oh, it is so terrible to be  a woman!\" The woman looked down at her. \"Now I hear he likes another  woman. I don't know who she is, but they say she is so clever, and  writes. Oh, it is so terrible, I can't bear it.\"    The woman leaned her elbow against the mantelpiece, and her face against  her hand. She looked down into the fire. Then she turned and looked at  the younger woman. \"Yes,\" she said, \"it is a very terrible thing to be a  woman.\" She was silent. She said with some difficulty: \"Are you sure you  love him? Are you sure it is not only the feeling a young girl has for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#3)"],[1,"harmonic model (stable  model) associated with an external reality.    Conclusion: a M-model interacts with a section of the external reality. M will  be a model made in an informational way by analogy with that section of the  external reality. Because M is a model, all the elements are connected between  them in a harmonic way, so that the model is stable. This stability is  verified on and on in an automatic way, as long as a specific external reality  is in interaction with the specific M-model.    M-models interact with some other type models, called ZM-models. ZM-models  take some information from one or more M-models and continue the construction  of models associated with the corresponding external reality. To do this, ZM-  models interact with the other ZM-models of the brain to improve M-models.    M-models are just preliminary models based on YM-models. A ZM model will take  any information from any other M and ZM models of the brain, to improve it.    Example: an M-model is associated with a bus that transports people. A ZM-  model takes this information and tries to see if this bus transports tourists  or is a public transport vehicle. To do this, it will use information taken  from any other ZM-models and M-models. The aim is to make a ZM-model, which  reflects as well as possible a section of the external reality. Because ZM is  a model, it is stable and because this model is integrated in a structure of  other ZM-models, the structure of ZM-models is stable too. This problem will  be treated later in details.    ZM-models are long-range models. This term will be explained later. Here, the  \"long-range model\" is understood as a model, which already developed its  elements as self standing models.    ZM models are the main models, which reflect the external reality.    We define now two very important terms: knowledge and consciousness.    Knowledge is associated with the facility to predict the evolution of the  external reality based on a structure of harmonic/logic models. This structure  was made by a large number of interactions with many sections of the external  reality and so it already generated a large number of good predictions. This  means that the only guarantee of the correctness of the knowledge is the  confidence in that structure of models. This issue will be developed in  details later in the book.    The consciousness is the facility to make and operate a model, associated with  the external reality, where the person itself is an element of that model.  When such a model is activated, it will also find the position of the person  in the model and so it will predict the position of the person in the external  reality. This issue will also be developed in detail in another part of the  book.    We will now develop some issues associated with the term \"knowledge\". We  already defined knowledge as the capacity to predict in a correct way the  evolution of the external reality.    Here we use the term \"correct\". Let's see what it means. This term has two  definitions. One situation is when a model makes a prediction and the  prediction is compared with IR. If the prediction meets IR, then the  prediction is \"correct\". Unfortunately, there are very few situations when the  comparison between prediction and IR is possible.    For instance, building a bridge. A problem is, for instance, if the bridge  will be stable or not in case of an earthquake. Here we need a guarantee that  the bridge is properly built and there is no possibility to verify this based  on IR.    The second definition of the term \"correct\" is: the brain will consider as  \"correct\" any prediction based on a harmonic/logic structure of models. To be  harmonic, the structure was already verified, based on IR in many other  situations. So, the only guarantee of a \"correct\" prediction is the confidence  in that structure of models.    MDT is associated with the basic hardware functions of the brain. Once we  described the hardware structure, everything what the MDT predicts is based on  what the hardware is able to do. What MDT says about knowledge is not another  theory on knowledge but what the hardware is able to do.    Any experiment is based on a model. That model tells us what we are doing and  the same model tells us what we get and what we see. Any model that makes the  experiment just improves itself. An improved model will make better  predictions and that is all. There is no guarantee associated with the  knowledge except the confidence in our own structure of models.    Let's see another aspect. We saw that any experiment is based on a model. The  model tells us what we did and what we get and see. If there are many persons  who participate in an experiment, everyone will make his/her own model based  on his/her own structure of models. What everyone gets and sees depends on  one's own structure of models.    Example: up to around year 1500 everybody knew that the Earth was the center  of the Universe. This idea was supported by direct observation of the sky but  also by a powerful structure of models. So, in that period, the astronomers  were able to calculate Sun and Moon eclipses, understand and calculate many  parameters associated with the movement of the Moon, Sun and stars. Even the  Holy Book supported this idea, at least in an implicit way. In that period,  the idea that Earth is the center of the Universe was correct.    I want to emphasize again that the situation is generated by the work  principle of the brain. It does not matter if we like or not this situation!  The situation will be the same forever. For instance, Newton's Mechanics  considers that there is a fundamental field of forces called \"gravity\".  Everybody considers that the gravity exists. But Einstein says that there is  no such a field of forces; what we see is just an effect of the distortion of  the space due to mass. If Einstein is right, the idea that there is gravity is  not correct anymore. See also the applications.    So, in every moment, the brain will consider as correct everything which is  generated by its structure of stable models.    Some scientists could consider these assertions as unacceptable, but  regardless of the fact that we like or not such a situation, the brain is able  to do only what the hardware structure is able to do.    There is another term that has some associated problems. This term is \"wrong\".  If a model makes wrong predictions, this usually does not mean that the model  is wrong. It means just that the model is not suitable to the given external  reality.    Faced with a new external reality, the brain will activate the model which  makes the best predictions associated with that external reality. If a model  makes wrong predictions, we have to change the model with another one or to  modify the model.    Example: Newton's symbolic model of Mechanics makes wrong predictions  associated with the objects moving at a speed comparable to the speed of  light, but its predictions are good (correct) at lower speed.    In any situation, the terms \"correct\" and \"wrong\" must be associated with a  model or with a structure of models.      We already described the first basic hardware facility associated with the  brain (human or animal). It generates truth, reality, knowledge and  consciousness. Now we will describe the second basic hardware facility of the  brain. This is the action on the external reality.    We already saw that faced with a section of the external reality, the brain  makes at least one ZM model. A ZM model works in association with any  available (or several) M-model and with any other ZMs of that brain. The main  ZM is able to predict in a correct way the evolution of a section of the  external reality. Such a ZM is able to make a new class of long-range models  called ZAMs.    ZAMs are artificial and invariant. An artificial model is made without any  direct interaction with the external reality. An invariant model is a model,  which cannot be changed by direct interaction with the external reality.    A ZM model will make a ZAM model in order to modify the external reality. Once  a ZAM is made, it becomes a reference model in changing the external reality.  To do this, the ZAM-model works in connection with a number of AZM models. An  AZM is a model which is already connected to the execution organs of a being  (for human beings these are legs, hands and so on).    Once a ZAM is activated, it will simulate the requested action using any  information from all models of the brain. Based on simulations, ZAM will  determine if it is able or not to meet the goal. If the simulation shows that  the action is possible, then the ZAM will activate AZM models for action on  the external reality. The ZAM will control the AZMs to act on the external  reality exactly as in the successful simulation, with good chances of success.  If by any simulation the objective is impossible to reach, the brain will be  blocked to do that activity.    Example: if a person has to jump over an obstacle, that person will know very  fast if the jump is possible or not. The person knows this, because a ZM makes  a ZAM-model, which is associated to the external reality (the person itself,  the supporting surface and the obstacle, as main elements). The ZAM then  simulates the jump on the model. If the simulated jump fails, the brain is  blocked to do the action. If the jump is done with success in the simulation,  the ZAM will control the body during the jump exactly as it was in the  simulation, with good chance of success.    No action on the external reality is possible without a successful simulation  of that action. The action will be as in the successful simulation. Both in an  immediate action and in an activity that has to be done in the future, any  brain follows this procedure.    We shall add some considerations about the speed of action on external  reality. So, when we walk on a plane surface,"]]]
