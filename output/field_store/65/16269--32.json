A later chapter will show  the relationship of the two.    The Mission activity that led to the founding of Missions in Lower  California had already long been in exercise in New Mexico. The reports  of Marcos de Nizza had fired the hearts of the zealous priests as  vigorously as they had excited the cupidity of the _Conquistadores_.  Four Franciscan priests, Marcos de Nizza, Antonio Victoria, Juan de  Padilla and Juan de la Cruz, together with a lay brother, Luis de  Escalona, accompanied Coronado on his expedition. On the third day out  Fray Antonio Victoria broke his leg, hence was compelled to return, and  Fray Marcos speedily left the expedition when Zuni was reached and  nothing was found to satisfy the cupidity of the Spaniards. He was  finally permitted to retire to Mexico, and there died, March 25, 1558.    For a time Mission activity in New Mexico remained dormant, not only on  account of intense preoccupation in other fields, but because the  political leaders seemed to see no purpose in attempting the further  subjugation of the country to the north (now New Mexico and Arizona).  But about forty years after Coronado, another explorer was filled with  adventurous zeal, and he applied for a charter or royal permission to  enter the country, conquer and colonize it for the honor and glory of  the king and his own financial reward and honorable renown. This leader  was Juan de Onate, who, in 1597, set out for New Mexico accompanied by  ten missionary padres, and in September of that year established the  second church in what is now United States territory. Juan de Onate was  the real colonizer of this new country. It was in 1595 that he made a  contract with the Viceroy of New Spain to colonize it at his own  expense. He was delayed, however, and could not set out until early in  1597, when he started with four hundred colonists, including two hundred  soldiers, women and children, and great herds of cattle and flocks of  sheep. In due time he reached what is now the village of Chamita,  calling it San Gabriel de los Espanoles, a few miles north of Santa Fe,  and there established, in September, 1598, the first town of New Mexico,  and the second of the United States (St. Augustine, in Florida, having  been the first, established in 1560 by Aviles de Menendez).    The work of Onate and the epoch it represents is graphically,  sympathetically and understandingly treated, _from the Indian's  standpoint_, by Marah Ellis Ryan, in her fascinating and illuminating  novel, _The Flute of the Gods_, which every student of the Missions of  New Mexico and Arizona (as also of California) will do well to read.    New Mexico has seen some of the most devoted missionaries of the world,  one of these, Fray Geronimo de Zarate Salmeron, having left a most  interesting, instructive account of \"the things that have been seen and  known in New Mexico, as well by sea as by land, from the year 1538 till  that of 1626.\"    This account was written in 1626 to induce other missionaries to enter  the field in which he was so earnest a laborer. For eight years he  worked in New Mexico, more than 280 years ago. In 1618 he was parish  priest at Jemez, mastered the Indian language and baptized 6566 Indians,  not counting those of Cia and Santa Ana. \"He also, single-handed and  alone, pacified and converted the lofty pueblo of Acoma, then hostile to  the Spanish. He built churches and monasteries, bore the fearful  hardships and dangers of a missionary's life then in that wilderness,  and has left us a most valuable chronicle.\" This was translated by Mr.  Lummis and appeared in _The Land of Sunshine_.    The missionaries who accompanied Juan de Onate in 1597 built a chapel at  San Gabriel, but no fragment of it remains, though in 1680 its ruins  were referred to. The second church in New Mexico was built about 1606  in Santa Fe, the new city founded the year before by Onate. This church,  however, did not last long, for it was soon outgrown, and in 1622, Fray  Alonzo de Benavides, the Franciscan historian of New Mexico, laid the  foundation of the parish church, which was completed in 1627. When, in  1870, it was decided to build the stone cathedral in Santa Fe, this old  church was demolished, except two large chapels and the old sanctuary.  It had been described in the official records shortly prior to its  demolition as follows: \"An adobe building 54 yards long by 9-1/2 in  width, with two small towers not provided with crosses, one containing  two bells and the other empty; the church being covered with the  _Crucero_ (the place where a church takes the form of a cross by the  side chapels), there are two large separate chapels, the one on the  north side dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary, called also 'La  Conquistadorea;' and on the south side the other dedicated to  St. Joseph.\"    Sometime shortly after 1636 the old church of San Miguel was built in  Santa Fe, and its original walls still form a part of the church that  stands to-day. It was partially demolished in the rebellion of 1680, but  was restored in 1710.    In 1617, nearly three hundred years ago, there were eleven churches in  New Mexico, the ruins of one of which, that of Pecos, can still be seen  a few miles above Glorieta on the Santa Fe main line. This pueblo was  once the largest in New Mexico, but it was deserted in 1840, and now its  great house, supposed to have been much larger than the many-storied  house of Zuni, is entirely in ruins.    It would form a fascinating chapter could I here tell of the stirring  history of some of the Missions established in New Mexico. There were  martyrs by the score, escapes miraculous and wonderful. Among the Hopis  one whole village was completely destroyed and in the neighborhood of  seven hundred of its men--all of them--slain by their fellow-Hopis of  other towns, simply because of their complaisance towards the hated,  foreign long-gowns (as the Franciscan priests were called). Suffice it  to say that Missions were established and churches built at practically  all of the Indian pueblos, and also at the Spanish settlements of San  Gabriel and Santa Cruz de la Canyada, many of which exist to this day.  In Texas, also, Missions had been established, the ruins of the chief of  which may be visited in one day from the city of San Antonio.        CHAPTER II    THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MISSIONS OF LOWER CALIFORNIA (MEXICO) AND ALTA  CALIFORNIA (UNITED STATES)    Rightly to understand the history of the Missions of the California of  the United States, it is imperative that the connection or relationship  that exists between their history and that of the Missions of Lower  California (Mexico) be clearly understood.    As I have already shown, the Jesuit padres founded fourteen Missions in  Lower California, which they conducted with greater or less success  until 1767, when the infamous Order of Expulsion of Carlos III of Spain  drove them into exile.    It had always been the intention of Spain to colonize and missionize  Alta California, even as far back as the days of Cabrillo in 1542, and  when Vizcaino, sixty years later, went over the same region, the  original intention was renewed. But intentions do not always fructify  and bring forth, so it was not until a hundred and sixty years after  Vizcaino that the work was actually begun. The reasons were diverse and  equally urgent. The King of Spain and his advisers were growing more  and more uneasy about the aggressions of the Russians and the English  on the California or rather the Pacific Coast. Russia was pushing down  from the north; England also had her establishments there, and with her  insular arrogance England boldly stated that she had the right to  California, or New Albion, as she called it, because of Sir Francis  Drake's landing and taking possession in the name of \"Good Queen Bess.\"  Spain not only resented this, but began to realize another need. Her  galleons from the Philippines found it a long, weary, tedious and  disease-provoking voyage around the coast of South America to Spain, and  besides, too many hostile and piratical vessels roamed over the Pacific  Sea to allow Spanish captains to sleep easy o' nights. Hence it was  decided that if ports of call were established on the California coast,  fresh meats and vegetables and pure water could be supplied to the  galleons, and in addition, with _presidios_ to defend them, they might  escape the plundering pirates by whom they were beset. Accordingly plans  were being formulated for the colonization and missionization of  California when, by authority of his own sweet will, ruling a people who  fully believed in the divine right of kings to do as they pleased, King  Carlos the Third issued the proclamation already referred to, totally  and completely banishing the Jesuits from all parts of his dominions,  under penalty of imprisonment and death.    I doubt whether many people of to-day, even though they be of the  Catholic Church, can realize what obedience to that order meant to these  devoted priests. Naturally they must obey it--monstrous though it  was--but the one thought that tore their hearts with anguish was: Who  would care for their Indian charges?    For these ignorant and benighted savages they had left their homes and  given up all that life ordinarily means and offers. Were they to be  allowed to drift back into their dark heathendom?    No! In spite of his cruelty to the Jesuits, the king had provided that  the Indians should not be neglected. He had appointed one in whom he had  especial confidence, Don Jose Galvez, as his _Visitador General_, and  had conferred upon him almost plenary authority. To his hands was  committed the carrying out of the order of banishment, the providing of  members of some other Catholic Order to care"]]]
