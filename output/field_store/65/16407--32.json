The sound of it must have been akin to that of our  modern tambourine, and it served much the same purpose as the  primitive drum, namely, to drive away Typhon or Set, the god  of evil. Dead kings were called \"Osiris\" when placed in their  tombs, and _sistri_ put with them in order to drive away Set.    Beside bells and rattles we must include all instruments of the  tambourine and gong species in the drum category. While there  are many different forms of the same instrument, there are  evidences of their all having at some time served the same  purpose, even down to that strange instrument about which  Du Chaillu tells us in his \"Equatorial Africa\", a bell of  leopard skin, with a clapper of fur, which was rung by the  wizard doctor when entering a hut where someone was ill or  dying. The leopard skin and fur clapper seem to have been  devised to make no noise, so as not to anger the demon that  was to be cast out. This reminds us strangely of the custom of  ringing a bell as the priest goes to administer the last rites.    It is said that first impressions are the strongest and most  lasting; certain it is that humanity, through all its social and  racial evolutions, has retained remnants of certain primitive  ideas to the present day. The army death reveille, the minute  gun, the tolling of bells for the dead, the tocsin, etc., all  have their roots in the attributes assigned to the primitive  drum; for, as I have already pointed out, the more civilized  a people becomes, the more the word-symbols degenerate. It  is this continual drifting away of the word-symbols from the  natural sounds which are occasioned by emotions that creates  the necessity for auxiliary means of expression, and thus  gives us instrumental music.    Since the advent of the drum a great stride toward civilization  had been made. Mankind no longer lived in caves but built huts  and even temples, and the conditions under which he lived  must have been similar to those of the natives of Central  Africa before travellers opened up the Dark Continent to the  caravan of the European trader. If we look up the subject in  the narratives of Livingstone or Stanley we find that these  people lived in groups of coarsely-thatched huts, the village  being almost invariably surrounded by a kind of stockade. Now  this manner of living is identically the same as that of all  savage tribes which have not passed beyond the drum state  of civilization, namely, a few huts huddled together and  surrounded by a palisade of bamboo or cane. Since the pith  would decompose in a short time, we should probably find that  the wind, whirling across such a palisade of pipes--for that is  what our bamboos would have turned to--would produce musical  sounds, in fact, exactly the sounds that a large set of Pan's  pipes would produce. For after all what we call Pan's pipes  are simply pieces of bamboo or cane of different lengths tied  together and made to sound by blowing across the open tops.    The theory may be objected to on the ground that it scarcely  proves the antiquity of the pipe to be less than that of the  drum; but the objection is hardly of importance when we consider  that the drum was known long before mankind had reached the  \"hut\" stage of civilization. Under the head of pipe, the  trumpet and all its derivatives must be accepted. On this point  there has been much controversy. But it seems reasonable to  believe that once it was found that sound could be produced  by blowing across the top of a hollow pipe, the most natural  thing to do would be to try the same effect on all hollow  things differing in shape and material from the original  bamboo. This would account for the conch shells of the Amazons  which, according to travellers' tales, were used to proclaim  an attack in war; in Africa the tusks of elephants were used;  in North America the instrument did not rise above the whistle  made from the small bones of a deer or of a turkey's leg.    That the Pan's pipes are the originals of all these species  seems hardly open to doubt. Even among the Greeks and Romans  we see traces of them in the double trumpet and the double  pipe. These trumpets became larger and larger in form, and  the force required to play them was such that the player  had to adopt a kind of leather harness to strengthen his  cheeks. Before this development had been reached, however,  I have no doubt that all wind instruments were of the Pan's  pipes variety; that is to say, the instruments consisted of a  hollow tube shut at one end, the sound being produced by the  breath catching on the open edge of the tube.    Direct blowing into the tube doubtless came later. In  this case the tube was open at both ends, and the sound  was determined by its length and by the force given to the  breath in playing. There is good reason for admitting this new  instrument to be a descendant of the Pan's pipes, for it was  evidently played by the nose at first. This would preclude  its being considered as an originally forcible instrument,  such as the trumpet.    Now that we have traced the history of the pipe and considered  the different types of the instrument, we can see immediately  that it brought no great new truth home to man as did the drum.    The savage who first climbed secretly to the top of the  stockade around his village to investigate the cause of the  mysterious sounds would naturally say that the Great Spirit  had revealed a mystery to him; and he would also claim to be  a wonder worker. But while his pipe would be accepted to a  certain degree, it was nevertheless second in the field and  could hardly replace the drum. Besides, mankind had already  commenced to think on a higher plane, and the pipe was reduced  to filling what gaps it could in the language of the emotions.    The second strongest emotion of the race is love. All over the  world, wherever we find the pipe in its softer, earlier form, we  find it connected with love songs. In time it degenerated into  a synonym for something contemptibly slothful and worthless,  so much so that Plato wished to banish it from his \"Republic,\"  saying that the Lydian pipe should not have a place in a  decent community.    On the other hand, the trumpet branch of the family developed  into something quite different. At the very beginning it was  used for war, and as its object was to frighten, it became  larger and larger in form, and more formidable in sound. In  this respect it only kept pace with the drum, for we read  of Assyrian and Thibetan trumpets two or three yards long,  and of the Aztec war drum which reached the enormous height  of ten feet, and could be heard for miles.    Now this, the trumpet species of pipe, we find also used as an  auxiliary \"spiritual\" help to the drum. We are told by M. Huc,  in his \"Travels in Thibet,\" that the llamas of Thibet have  a custom of assembling on the roofs of Lhassa at a stated  period and blowing enormous trumpets, making the most hideous  midnight din imaginable. The reason given for this was that  in former days the city was terrorized by demons who rose from  a deep ravine and crept through all the houses, working evil  everywhere. After the priests had exorcised them by blowing  these trumpets, the town was troubled no more. In Africa the  same demonstration of trumpet blowing occurs at an eclipse  of the moon; and, to draw the theory out to a thin thread,  anyone who has lived in a small German Protestant town will  remember the chorals which are so often played before sunrise  by a band of trumpets, horns, and trombones from the belfry of  some church tower. Almost up to the end of the last century  trombones were intimately connected with the church service;  and if we look back to Zoroaster we find the sacerdotal  character of this species of instrument very plainly indicated.    Now let us turn back to the Pan's pipes and its direct  descendants, the flute, the clarinet, and the oboe. We shall  find that they had no connection whatever with religious  observances. Even in the nineteenth century novel we are  familiar with the kind of hero who played the flute--a very  sentimental gentleman always in love. If he had played the  clarinet he would have been very sorrowful and discouraged; and  if it had been the oboe (which, to the best of my knowledge,  has never been attempted in fiction) he would have needed to  be a very ill man indeed.    Now we never hear of these latter kinds of pipes being  considered fit for anything but the dance, love songs, or love  charms. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Garcilaso  de la Vega, the historian of Peru, tells of the astonishing  power of a love song played on a flute. We find so-called  \"courting\" flutes in Formosa and Peru, and Catlin tells of the  Winnebago courting flute. The same instrument was known in Java,  as the old Dutch settlers have told us. But we never hear of it  as creating awe, or as being thought a fit instrument to use  with the drum or trumpet in connection with religious rites.  Leonardo da Vinci had a flute player make music while he  painted his picture of Mona Lisa, thinking that it gave her the  expression he wished to catch--that strange smile reproduced  in the Louvre painting. The flute member of the pipe species,  therefore, was more or less an emblem of eroticism, and, as I  have already said, has never been even "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#3)"],[1,"life with their _confreres_, or that they could speak a  strange language; for we may well call that language strange which is, in  the main, Sanscrit, with many Persian words intermingled.  Mr Dickens,  however, did not pretend, as some have done, to specially treat of  Gipsies, and he made no affectation of a knowledge of any mysteries.  He  simply reflected popular life as he saw it.  But there are many novels  and tales, old and new, devoted to setting forth Rommany life and  conversation, which are as much like the originals as a Pastor Fido is  like a common shepherd.  One novel which I once read, is so full of \"the  dark blood,\" that it might almost be called a gipsy novel.  The hero is a  gipsy; he lives among his kind--the book is full of them; and yet, with  all due respect to its author, who is one of the most gifted and best-  informed romance writers of the century, I must declare that, from  beginning to end, there is not in the novel the slightest indication of  any real and familiar knowledge of gipsies.  Again, to put thieves' slang  into the mouths of gipsies, as their natural and habitual language, has  been so much the custom, from Sir Walter Scott to the present day, that  readers are sometimes gravely assured in good faith that this jargon is  pure Rommany.  But this is an old error in England, since the vocabulary  of cant appended to the \"English Rogue,\" published in 1680, was long  believed to be Gipsy; and Captain Grose, the antiquary, who should have  known better, speaks with the same ignorance.    It is, indeed, strange to see learned and shrewd writers, who pride  themselves on truthfully depicting every element of European life, and  every type of every society, so ignorant of the habits, manners, and  language of thousands of really strange people who swarm on the highways  and bye-ways!  We have had the squire and the governess, my lord and all  Bohemia--Bohemia, artistic and literary--but where are our _Vrais  Bohemiens_?--Out of Lavengro and Rommany Rye--nowhere.  Yet there is to  be found among the children of Rom, or the descendants of the worshippers  of Rama, or the Doms or Coptic Romi, whatever their ancestors may have  been, more that is quaint and adapted to the purposes of the novelist,  than is to be found in any other class of the inhabitants of England.  You  may not detect a trace of it on the roads; but once become truly  acquainted with a fair average specimen of a Gipsy, pass many days in  conversation with him, and above all acquire his confidence and respect,  and you will wonder that such a being, so entirely different from  yourself, could exist in Europe in the nineteenth century.  It is said  that those who can converse with Irish peasants in their own native  tongue, form far higher opinions of their appreciation of the beautiful,  and of the elements of humour and pathos in their hearts, than do those  who know their thoughts only through the medium of English.  I know from  my own observation that this is quite the case with the Indians of North  America, and it is unquestionably so with the Gipsy.  When you know a  true specimen to the depths of his soul, you will find a character so  entirely strange, so utterly at variance with your ordinary conceptions  of humanity, that it is no exaggeration whatever to declare that it would  be a very difficult task for the best writer to convey to the most  intelligent reader an idea of his subject's nature.  You have in him, to  begin with, a being whose every condition of life is in direct  contradiction to what you suppose every man's life in England must be.  \"I  was born in the open air,\" said a Gipsy to me a few days since; \"and put  me down anywhere, in the fields or woods, I can always support myself.\"  Understand me, he did not mean by pilfering, since it was of America that  we were speaking, and of living in the lonely forests.  We pity with  tears many of the poor among us, whose life is one of luxury compared to  that which the Gipsy, who despises them, enjoys with a zest worth more  than riches.    \"What a country America must be,\" quoth Pirengro, the Walker, to me, on  the occasion just referred to.  \"Why, my pal, who's just welled apopli  from dovo tem--(my brother, who has just returned from that country),  tells me that when a cow or anything dies there, they just chuck it away,  and nobody ask a word for any of it.\"  \"What would _you_ do,\" he  continued, \"if you were in the fields and had nothing to eat?\"    I replied, \"that if any could be found, I should hunt for fern-roots.\"    \"I could do better than that,\" he said.  \"I should hunt for a  _hotchewitchi_,--a hedge-hog,--and I should be sure to find one; there's  no better eating.\"    Whereupon assuming his left hand to be an imaginary hedge-hog, he  proceeded to score and turn and dress it for ideal cooking with a case-  knife.    \"And what had you for dinner to-day?\" I inquired.    \"Some cocks' heads.  They're very fine--very fine indeed!\"    Now it is curious but true that there is no person in the world more  particular as to what he eats than the half-starved English or Irish  peasant, whose sufferings have so often been set forth for our  condolence.  We may be equally foolish, you and I--in fact chemistry  proves it--when we are disgusted at the idea of feeding on many things  which mere association and superstition render revolting.  But the old  fashioned gipsy has none of these qualms--he is haunted by no ghost of  society--save the policeman, he knows none of its terrors.  Whatever is  edible he eats, except horse-meat; wherever there is an empty spot he  sleeps; and the man who can do this devoid of shame, without caring a pin  for what the world says--nay, without even knowing that he does not care,  or that he is peculiar--is independent to a degree which of itself  confers a character which is not easy to understand.    I grew up as a young man with great contempt for Helvetius, D'Holbach,  and all the French philosophers of the last century, whose ideal man was  a perfect savage; but I must confess that since I have studied gipsy  nature, my contempt has changed into wonder where they ever learned in  their _salons_ and libraries enough of humanity to theorise so boldly,  and with such likeness to truth, as they did.  It is not merely in the  absolute out-of-doors independence of the old-fashioned Gipsy, freer than  any wild beast from care for food, that his resemblance to a  \"philosopher\" consists, or rather to the ideal man, free from imaginary  cares.  For more than this, be it for good or for evil, the real Gipsy  has, unlike all other men, unlike the lowest savage, positively no  religion, no tie to a spiritual world, no fear of a future, nothing but a  few trifling superstitions and legends, which in themselves indicate no  faith whatever in anything deeply seated.  It would be difficult, I  think, for any highly civilised man, who had not studied Thought deeply,  and in a liberal spirit, to approach in the least to a rational  comprehension of a real Gipsy mind.  During my life it has been my  fortune to become intimate with men who were \"absolutely\" or \"positively\"  free-thinkers--men who had, by long study and mere logic, completely  freed themselves from any mental tie whatever.  Such men are rare; it  requires an enormous amount of intellectual culture, an unlimited  expenditure of pains in the metaphysical hot-bed, and tremendous self-  confidence to produce them--I mean \"the real article.\"  Among the most  thorough of these, a man on whom utter and entire freedom of thought sat  easily and unconsciously, was a certain German doctor of philosophy named  P---.  To him God and all things were simply ideas of development.  The  last remark which I can recall from him was \"_Ja, ja_.  We advanced  Hegelians agree exactly on the whole with the Materialists.\"  Now, to my  mind, nothing seems more natural than that, when sitting entire days  talking with an old Gipsy, no one rises so frequently from the past  before me as Mr P---.  To him all religion represented a portion of the  vast mass of frozen, petrified developments, which simply impede the  march of intelligent minds; to my Rommany friend, it is one of the  thousand inventions of _gorgio_ life, which, like policemen, are simply  obstacles to Gipsies in the search of a living, and could he have grasped  the circumstances of the case, he would doubtless have replied \"_Avali_,  we Gipsies agree on the whole exactly with Mr P---.\"  Extremes meet.    One Sunday an old Gipsy was assuring me, with a great appearance of  piety, that on that day she neither told fortunes nor worked at any kind  of labour--in fact, she kept it altogether correctly.    \"_Avali_, _dye_,\" I replied.  \"Do you know what the Gipsies in Germany  say became of their church?\"    \"_Kek_,\" answered the old lady.  \"No.  What is it?\"    \"They say that the Gipsies' church was made of pork, and the dogs ate  it.\"    Long, loud, and joyously affirmative was the peal of laughter with which  the Gipsies welcomed this characteristic story.    So far as research and the analogy of living tribes of the same race can  establish a fact, it would seem that the Gipsies were, previous to their  quitting India, not people of high caste, but wandering Pariahs,  outcasts, foes to the Brahmins, and unbelievers.  All the Pariahs are not  free-thinkers, but in India, the Church, as in Italy, loses no time in  making of all detected free-thinkers Pariahs.  Thus we are told, in the  introduction to the English translation of that very curious book, \"The  Tales of the Gooroo Simple,\" which should be read by every scholar, that  all the true literature of the country--that which has life, and freedom,  and humour--comes from the Pariahs.  And was it different in those days,  when Rabelais, and Von Hutten, and Giordano Bruno were, in their wise,  Pariahs and Gipsies, roving from city to city, often wanting bread and "]]]
