I think you may like to know something of his person and character.  He  had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well  set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was  skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when  he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes  did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was  extremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too, and, on  occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his  great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in  prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.  In the  latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to  educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to  his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading  people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of  the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his  judgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons  about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen  an arbitrator between contending parties.    At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible  friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some  ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve  the minds of his children.  By this means he turned our attention to  what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or  no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table,  whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad  flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind,  so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters  as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so  unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a  few hours after dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience  to me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very  unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,  because better instructed, tastes and appetites.    My mother had likewise an excellent constitution:  she suckled all her  ten children.  I never knew either my father or mother to have any  sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of  age.  They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since  placed a marble over their grave, with this inscription:                            JOSIAH FRANKLIN,                                 and                           ABIAH his Wife,                         lie here interred.               They lived lovingly together in wedlock                          fifty-five years.            Without an estate, or any gainful employment,                   By constant labor and industry,                        with God's blessing,                   They maintained a large family                            comfortably,                  and brought up thirteen children                       and seven grandchildren                             reputably.                     From this instance, reader,             Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,                    And distrust not Providence.                   He was a pious and prudent man;                 She, a discreet and virtuous woman.                         Their youngest son,                  In filial regard to their memory,                         Places this stone.                J.F. born 1655, died 1744, AEtat 89.                A.F. born 1667, died 1752, ----- 95.      By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old.  I us'd  to write more methodically.  But one does not dress for private company  as for a publick ball.  'Tis perhaps only negligence.    To return:  I continued thus employed in my father's business for two  years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who  was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up  for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was  destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.  But my  dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that  if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and  get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation.  He  therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,  bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might  observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other  on land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen  handle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much  by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman  could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for my  experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and  warm in my mind.  My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and  my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in  London, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be  with him some time on liking.  But his expectations of a fee with me  displeasing my father, I was taken home again.    From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came  into my hands was ever laid out in books.  Pleased with the Pilgrim's  Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate  little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's  Historical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40  or 50 in all.  My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in  polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted  that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper  books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not  be a clergyman.  Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly,  and I still think that time spent to great advantage.  There was also a  book of De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr.  Mather's, called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of  thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events  of my life.    This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a  printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.  In  1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to  set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much better than that of my  father, but still had a hankering for the sea.  To prevent the  apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to  have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time, but at last was  persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years  old.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of  age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a  useful hand to my brother.  I now had access to better books.  An  acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes  to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.  Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when  the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the  morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.    And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had  a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house,  took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me  such books as I chose to read.  I now took a fancy to poetry, and made  some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turn to account,  encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads.  One was  called The Lighthouse Tragedy, and contained an account of the drowning  of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters: the other was a sailor's  song, on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard) the pirate.  They were  wretched stuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were  printed he sent me about the town to sell them.  The first sold  wonderfully, the event being recent, having made a great noise.  This  flattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my  performances, and telling me verse-makers were generally beggars.  So I  escaped being a poet, most probably a very bad one; but as prose  writing had been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a  principal means of my advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a  situation, I acquired what little ability I have in that way.    There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with  whom I was intimately acquainted.  We sometimes disputed, and very fond  we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another, which  disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad habit,  making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the  contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,  besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of  disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for  friendship.  I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute  about religion.  Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom  fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that  have been bred at Edinborough.    A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,  of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their  abilities for study.  He was of opinion that it was improper, and that  they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#3)"],[1,"  studded with great stones just about this part, stretching away on all  sides. It was a wise Lord Craven, I think, who pitched his tent there.    Passing along the Ridgeway to the east, we soon come to cultivated land.  The downs, strictly so called, are no more. Lincolnshire farmers have  been imported, and the long, fresh slopes are sheep-walks no more, but  grow famous turnips and barley. One of these improvers lives over there  at the \"Seven Barrows\" farm, another mystery of the great downs. There  are the barrows still, solemn and silent, like ships in the calm sea,  the sepulchres of some sons of men. But of whom? It is three miles from  the White Horse--too far for the slain of Ashdown to be buried there.  Who shall say what heroes are waiting there? But we must get down into  the Vale again, and so away by the Great Western Railway to town,  for time and the printer's devil press, and it is a terrible long and  slippery descent, and a shocking bad road. At the bottom, however, there  is a pleasant public; whereat we must really take a modest quencher, for  the down air is provocative of thirst. So we pull up under an old oak  which stands before the door.    \"What is the name of your hill, landlord?\"    \"Blawing STWUN Hill, sir, to be sure.\"    [READER. \"Stuym?\"    AUTHOR: \"Stone, stupid--the Blowing Stone.\"]    \"And of your house? I can't make out the sign.\"    \"Blawing Stwun, sir,\" says the landlord, pouring out his old ale from a  Toby Philpot jug, with a melodious crash, into the long-necked glass.    \"What queer names!\" say we, sighing at the end of our draught, and  holding out the glass to be replenished.    \"Bean't queer at all, as I can see, sir,\" says mine host, handing back  our glass, \"seeing as this here is the Blawing Stwun, his self,\" putting  his hand on a square lump of stone, some three feet and a half high,  perforated with two or three queer holes, like petrified antediluvian  rat-holes, which lies there close under the oak, under our very nose. We  are more than ever puzzled, and drink our second glass of ale, wondering  what will come next. \"Like to hear un, sir?\" says mine host, setting  down Toby Philpot on the tray, and resting both hands on the \"Stwun.\" We  are ready for anything; and he, without waiting for a reply, applies his  mouth to one of the ratholes. Something must come of it, if he doesn't  burst. Good heavens! I hope he has no apoplectic tendencies. Yes, here  it comes, sure enough, a gruesome sound between a moan and a roar, and  spreads itself away over the valley, and up the hillside, and into the  woods at the back of the house, a ghost-like, awful voice. \"Um do say,  sir,\" says mine host, rising purple-faced, while the moan is still  coming out of the Stwun, \"as they used in old times to warn the  country-side by blawing the Stwun when the enemy was a-comin', and as  how folks could make un heered then for seven mile round; leastways, so  I've heered Lawyer Smith say, and he knows a smart sight about them old  times.\" We can hardly swallow Lawyer Smith's seven miles; but could the  blowing of the stone have been a summons, a sort of sending the fiery  cross round the neighbourhood in the old times? What old times? Who  knows? We pay for our beer, and are thankful.    \"And what's the name of the village just below, landlord?\"    \"Kingstone Lisle, sir.\"    \"Fine plantations you've got here?\"    \"Yes, sir; the Squire's 'mazing fond of trees and such like.\"    \"No wonder. He's got some real beauties to be fond of. Good-day,  landlord.\"    \"Good-day, sir, and a pleasant ride to 'ee.\"    And now, my boys, you whom I want to get for readers, have you had  enough? Will you give in at once, and say you're convinced, and let me  begin my story, or will you have more of it? Remember, I've only been  over a little bit of the hillside yet--what you could ride round easily  on your ponies in an hour. I'm only just come down into the Vale, by  Blowing Stone Hill; and if I once begin about the Vale, what's to stop  me? You'll have to hear all about Wantage, the birthplace of Alfred, and  Farringdon, which held out so long for Charles the First (the Vale was  near Oxford, and dreadfully malignant--full of Throgmortons, Puseys,  and Pyes, and such like; and their brawny retainers). Did you ever read  Thomas Ingoldsby's \"Legend of Hamilton Tighe\"? If you haven't, you ought  to have. Well, Farringdon is where he lived, before he went to sea;  his real name was Hamden Pye, and the Pyes were the great folk at  Farringdon. Then there's Pusey. You've heard of the Pusey horn, which  King Canute gave to the Puseys of that day, and which the gallant old  squire, lately gone to his rest (whom Berkshire freeholders turned out  of last Parliament, to their eternal disgrace, for voting according to  his conscience), used to bring out on high days, holidays, and bonfire  nights. And the splendid old cross church at Uffington, the Uffingas  town. How the whole countryside teems with Saxon names and memories!  And the old moated grange at Compton, nestled close under the hillside,  where twenty Marianas may have lived, with its bright water-lilies  in the moat, and its yew walk, \"the cloister walk,\" and its peerless  terraced gardens. There they all are, and twenty things beside, for  those who care about them, and have eyes. And these are the sort of  things you may find, I believe, every one of you, in any common English  country neighbourhood.    Will you look for them under your own noses, or will you not? Well,  well, I've done what I can to make you; and if you will go gadding over  half Europe now, every holidays, I can't help it. I was born and bred  a west-country man, thank God! a Wessex man, a citizen of the noblest  Saxon kingdom of Wessex, a regular \"Angular Saxon,\" the very soul of me  adscriptus glebae. There's nothing like the old country-side for me,  and no music like the twang of the real old Saxon tongue, as one gets  it fresh from the veritable chaw in the White Horse Vale; and I say with  \"Gaarge Ridler,\" the old west-country yeoman,--         \"Throo aall the waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast,       Commend me to merry owld England mwoast;       While vools gwoes prating vur and nigh,       We stwops at whum, my dog and I.\"    Here, at any rate, lived and stopped at home Squire Brown, J.P. for the  county of Berks, in a village near the foot of the White Horse range.  And here he dealt out justice and mercy in a rough way, and begat sons  and daughters, and hunted the fox, and grumbled at the badness of  the roads and the times. And his wife dealt out stockings, and calico  shirts, and smock frocks, and comforting drinks to the old folks with  the \"rheumatiz,\" and good counsel to all; and kept the coal and clothes'  clubs going, for yule-tide, when the bands of mummers came round,  dressed out in ribbons and coloured paper caps, and stamped round the  Squire's kitchen, repeating in true sing-song vernacular the legend of  St. George and his fight, and the ten-pound doctor, who plays his  part at healing the Saint--a relic, I believe, of the old Middle-age  mysteries. It was the first dramatic representation which greeted the  eyes of little Tom, who was brought down into the kitchen by his nurse  to witness it, at the mature age of three years. Tom was the eldest  child of his parents, and from his earliest babyhood exhibited the  family characteristics in great strength. He was a hearty, strong boy  from the first, given to fighting with and escaping from his nurse, and  fraternizing with all the village boys, with whom he made expeditions  all round the neighbourhood. And here, in the quiet old-fashioned  country village, under the shadow of the everlasting hills, Tom Brown  was reared, and never left it till he went first to school, when nearly  eight years of age, for in those days change of air twice a year was not  thought absolutely necessary for the health of all her Majesty's lieges.    I have been credibly informed, and am inclined to believe, that the  various boards of directors of railway companies, those gigantic jobbers  and bribers, while quarrelling about everything else, agreed together  some ten years back to buy up the learned profession of medicine, body  and soul. To this end they set apart several millions of money, which  they continually distribute judiciously among the doctors, stipulating  only this one thing, that they shall prescribe change of air to every  patient who can pay, or borrow money to pay, a railway fare, and see  their prescription carried out. If it be not for this, why is it that  none of us can be well at home for a year together? It wasn't so twenty  years ago, not a bit of it. The Browns didn't go out of the country once  in five years. A visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year, at assizes  or quarter sessions, which the Squire made on his horse with a pair  of saddle-bags containing his wardrobe, a stay of a day or two at some  country neighbour's, or an expedition to a county ball or the yeomanry  review, made up the sum of the Brown locomotion in most years. A stray  Brown from some distant county dropped in every now and then; or from  Oxford, on grave nag, an old don, contemporary of the Squire; and were  looked upon by the Brown household and the villagers with the same sort  of feeling with which we now regard a man who has crossed the Rocky  Mountains, or launched a boat on the Great Lake in Central Africa. The  White Horse Vale, remember, was traversed by no great road--nothing but  country parish roads, and these very bad. Only one coach ran there, and  this one only from Wantage to London, so that the western part of the  Vale was without regular means of moving on, and certainly didn't  seem to want them. There was the canal, by the way, which supplied the  country-side with coal, and up and down which continually went the long  barges, with the big black men lounging by the side of the horses along  the towing-"]]]
