Philip of Macedon married Larissa, a dancer, and the dancer  Aristodemus was ambassador to his Court. These dancers must not be  confounded with those hired to dance at feasts, etc. (figs. 9, 14 and  18).  [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Etruscan bronze dancer with eyes of  diamonds, found at Verona. Now in the British Museum.]          CHAPTER III.      ETRUSCAN-SOUTH ITALIAN, ROMAN DANCING, ETC.    One of the most important nations of antiquity was the Etruscan,  inhabiting, according to some authorities, a dominion from Lombardy to  the Alps, and from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic.    Etruria gave a dynasty to Rome in Servius Tullius, who originally was  Masterna, an Etruscan.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Etruscan dancer. From a painting in the  Grotta dei Vasi dipinti--Corneto.]    It is, however, with the dancing that we are dealing. There is little  doubt that they were dancers in every sense; there are many ancient  sepulchres in Etruria, with dancing painted on their walls. Other  description than that of the pictures we do not possess, for as yet  the language is a dead letter. There is no doubt, as Gerhardt  [Footnote: \"Ann. Institut.\": 1831, p. 321.] suggests, that they  considered dancing as one of the emblems of joy in a future state,  and that the dead were received with dancing and music in their new  home. They danced to the music of the pipes, the lyre, the castanets  of wood, steel, or brass, as is shown in the illustrations taken from  the monuments.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Etruscan dancing and performances. From  paintings in the Grotta della Scimia Corneto, about 500 B.C.]    That the Phoenicians and Greeks had at certain times immense influence  on the Etruscans is evident from their relics which we possess (fig.  20).    A characteristic illustration of the dancer is from a painting in the  tomb of the _Vasi dipinti_, Corneto, which, according to Mr. Dennis,  [Footnote: \"Etruria,\" vol. i., p. 380.] belongs to the archaic period,  and is perhaps as early as 600 B.C. It exhibits a stronger Greek  influence than some of the paintings. Fig. 21, showing a military  dance to pipes, with other sports, comes from the _Grotta della  Scimia_, also at Corneto; these show a more purely Etruscan character.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Etruscan Dancing. From the Grotta del  Triclinio.--Corneto.]    The pretty dancing scene from the _Grotta del Triclinio_ at Corneto  is taken from a full-sized copy in the British Museum, and is of the  greatest interest. It is considered to be of the Greco-Etruscan  period, and later than the previous examples (fig. 22).    There is a peculiarity in the attitude of the hands, and of the  fingers being kept flat and close together; it is not a little curious  that the modern Japanese dance, as exhibited by Mme. Sadi Yacca, has  this peculiarity, whether the result of ancient tradition or of modern  revival, the writer cannot say.    Almost as interesting as the Etruscan are the illustrations of dancing  found in the painted tombs of the Campagna and Southern Italy, once  part of \"Magna Grecia\"; the figure of a funeral dance, with the double  pipe accompaniments, from a painted tomb near Albanella (fig. 23) may  be as late as 300 B.C., and those in figs. 24, 25 from a tomb near  Capua are probably of about the same period. These Samnite dances  appear essentially different from the Etruscan; although both Greek  and Etruscan influence are very evident, they are more solemn and  stately. This may, however, arise from a different national custom.    That the Etruscan, Sabellian, Oscan, Samnite, and other national  dances of the country had some influence on the art in Rome is highly  probable, but the paucity of early Roman examples renders the evidence  difficult.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Funeral dance in the obsequies of a female.  From a painted tomb near Albanella.]    Rome as a conquering imperial power represented nearly the whole world  of its day, and its dances accordingly were most numerous. Amongst the  illustrations already given we have many that were preserved in Rome.  In the beginning of its existence as a power only religious dances  were practised, and many of these were of Etruscan origin, such as the  Lupercalia, the Ambarvalia, &c. In the former the dancers were  demi-nude, and probably originally shepherds; the latter was a serious  dancing procession through fields and villages.  [Illustration: Fig.  24.--Funeral dance. From Capua.]    A great dance of a severe kind was executed by the Salii, priests of  Mars, an ecclesiastical corporation of twelve chosen patricians. In  their procession and dance, on March 1, and succeeding days, carrying  the Ancilia, they sang songs and hymns, and afterwards retired to a  great banquet in the Temple of Mars. That the practice was originally  Etruscan may be gathered from the circumstance that on a gem showing  the armed priests carrying the shields there are Etruscan letters.  There were also an order of female Salii. Another military dance was  the _Saltatio bellicrepa_, said to have been instituted by Romulus in  commemoration of the Rape of the Sabines. The Pyrrhic dance (fig. 13)  was also introduced into Rome by Julius Caesar, and was danced by the  children of the leading men of Asia and Bithynia.    As, however, the State increased in power by conquest, it absorbed  with other countries other habits, and the art degenerated often, like  that of Greece and Etruria, into a vehicle for orgies, when they  brought to Rome with their Asiatic captives even more licentious  practices and dances.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Funeral dance from the same tomb.]    As Rome, which never rose to the intellectual and imaginative state of  Greece in her best period, represented wealth, commerce, and conquest,  in a greater degree, so were her arts, and with these the lyric. In  her best state her nobles danced, Appius Claudius excelled, and  Sallust tells us that Sempronia \"psaltere saltare elegantius\"; so that  in those days ladies played and danced, but no Roman citizen danced  except in the religious dances. They carried mimetic dances to a very  perfect character in the time of Augustus under the term of _Musica  muta_. After the second Punic war, as Greek habits made their way into  Italy, it became a fashion for the young to learn to dance. The  education in dancing and gesture were important in the actor, as masks  prevented any display of feature. The position of the actor was never  recognized professionally, and was considered _infamia_. But the  change came, which caused Cicero to say \"no one danced when sober.\"  Eventually the performers of lower class occupied the dancing  platform, and Herculaneum and Pompeii have shown us the results.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Bacchante leading the Dionysian bull to the  altar. Bas-relief in the Vatican.]    In the theatre the method of the Roman chorus differed from that of  the Greeks. In the latter the orchestra or place for the dancing and  chorus was about 12 ft. below the stage, with steps to ascend when  these were required; in the former the chorus was not used in comedy,  and having no orchestra was in tragedies placed upon the stage. The  getting together of the chorus was a public service, or liturgia, and  in the early days of Grecian prosperity was provided by the choregus.    Tiberius by a decree abolished the Saturnalia, and exiled the dancing  teachers, but the many acts of the Senate to secure a better standard  were useless against the foreign inhabitants of the Empire accustomed  to sensuality and licence.    [Illustration: Fig. 27--Bacchante. From a fresco, Pompeii, 1st century  B.C.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Dancer. From a fresco in the Baths of  Constantine, 4th century A.D.]    Perhaps the encouragement of the more brutal combats of the Coliseum  did something to suppress the more delicate arts, but historians have  told us, and it is common knowledge, what became of the great Empire,  and the lyric with other arts were destroyed by licentious  preferences.          CHAPTER IV.      THE \"EARLY ENGLISH\" AND \"MEDIAEVAL\" DANCE TO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.    The last illustration from the Baths of Constantine brought us into  the Christian era, although that example was not of Christian  sentiment or art. It is possible that the dance of Salome with its  diabolical reward may have prejudiced the Apostolic era, for we find  no example of dancing, as exhibiting joy, in Christian Art of that  period. The dance before Herod is historical proof that the higher  classes of Hebrews danced for amusement.    As soon, however, as Christianity became enthroned, and a settled  society, we read of religious dances as exhibiting joy, even in the  churches. Tertullian tells us that they danced to the singing of hymns  and canticles. These dances were solemn and graceful to the old tones;  and continued, notwithstanding many prohibitions such as those of Pope  Zacharias (a Syrian) in A.D. 744. The dancing at Easter in the  Cathedral at Paris was prohibited by Archbishop Odo in the 12th  century, but notwithstanding the antagonism of the Fathers, the dances  were only partially suppressed.    They were common on religious festivals in Spain and Portugal up to  the seventeenth century and in some localities continue even to our  own time. When S. Charles Borromeo was canonized in 1610, the  Portuguese, who had him as patron, made a procession of four chariots  of dancers; one to Renown, another to the City of Milan, one to  represent Portugal and a fourth to represent the Church. In Seville at  certain periods, and in the Balearic Isles, they still dance in  religious ceremonies.    We know that religious dancing has continually been performed as an  accessory to prayer, and is still so used by the Mahommedans, the  American Indians and the Bedos of India, who dance into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#3)"],[1," perfect blonde,  she had eyes and lashes as black as a Creole's, which, together with  her full red lips, told me that this beautiful stranger, whose touch  had so startled me, was not a child of our northern shores.    \"Forgive me,\" she said, speaking with an odd, pretty accent, and laying  a slim hand, with jeweled fingers, confidingly upon my arm, \"if I  startled you.  But--is it true that Sir Crichton Davey has  been--murdered?\"    I looked into her big, questioning eyes, a harsh suspicion laboring in  my mind, but could read nothing in their mysterious depths--only I  wondered anew at my questioner's beauty.  The grotesque idea  momentarily possessed me that, were the bloom of her red lips due to  art and not to nature, their kiss would leave--though not  indelibly--just such a mark as I had seen upon the dead man's hand.  But I dismissed the fantastic notion as bred of the night's horrors,  and worthy only of a mediaeval legend.  No doubt she was some friend or  acquaintance of Sir Crichton who lived close by.    \"I cannot say that he has been murdered,\" I replied, acting upon the  latter supposition, and seeking to tell her what she asked as gently as  possible.    \"But he is--Dead?\"    I nodded.    She closed her eyes and uttered a low, moaning sound, swaying dizzily.  Thinking she was about to swoon, I threw my arm round her shoulder to  support her, but she smiled sadly, and pushed me gently away.    \"I am quite well, thank you,\" she said.    \"You are certain?  Let me walk with you until you feel quite sure of  yourself.\"    She shook her head, flashed a rapid glance at me with her beautiful  eyes, and looked away in a sort of sorrowful embarrassment, for which I  was entirely at a loss to account.  Suddenly she resumed:    \"I cannot let my name be mentioned in this dreadful matter, but--I  think I have some information--for the police.  Will you give this  to--whomever you think proper?\"    She handed me a sealed envelope, again met my eyes with one of her  dazzling glances, and hurried away.  She had gone no more than ten or  twelve yards, and I still was standing bewildered, watching her  graceful, retreating figure, when she turned abruptly and came back.    Without looking directly at me, but alternately glancing towards a  distant corner of the square and towards the house of Major-General  Platt-Houston, she made the following extraordinary request:    \"If you would do me a very great service, for which I always would be  grateful,\"--she glanced at me with passionate intentness--\"when you  have given my message to the proper person, leave him and do not go  near him any more to-night!\"    Before I could find words to reply she gathered up her cloak and ran.  Before I could determine whether or not to follow her (for her words  had aroused anew all my worst suspicions) she had disappeared!  I heard  the whir of a restarted motor at no great distance, and, in the instant  that Nayland Smith came running down the steps, I knew that I had  nodded at my post.    \"Smith!\"  I cried as he joined me, \"tell me what we must do!\" And  rapidly I acquainted him with the incident.    My friend looked very grave; then a grim smile crept round his lips.    \"She was a big card to play,\" he said; \"but he did not know that I held  one to beat it.\"    \"What!  You know this girl!  Who is she?\"    \"She is one of the finest weapons in the enemy's armory, Petrie.  But a  woman is a two-edged sword, and treacherous.  To our great good  fortune, she has formed a sudden predilection, characteristically  Oriental, for yourself.  Oh, you may scoff, but it is evident.  She was  employed to get this letter placed in my hands.  Give it to me.\"    I did so.    \"She has succeeded.  Smell.\"    He held the envelope under my nose, and, with a sudden sense of nausea,  I recognized the strange perfume.    \"You know what this presaged in Sir Crichton's case?  Can you doubt any  longer?  She did not want you to share my fate, Petrie.\"    \"Smith,\" I said unsteadily, \"I have followed your lead blindly in this  horrible business and have not pressed for an explanation, but I must  insist before I go one step farther upon knowing what it all means.\"    \"Just a few steps farther,\" he rejoined; \"as far as a cab.  We are  hardly safe here.  Oh, you need not fear shots or knives.  The man  whose servants are watching us now scorns to employ such clumsy,  tell-tale weapons.\"    Only three cabs were on the rank, and, as we entered the first,  something hissed past my ear, missed both Smith and me by a miracle,  and, passing over the roof of the taxi, presumably fell in the enclosed  garden occupying the center of the square.    \"What was that?\" I cried.    \"Get in--quickly!\"  Smith rapped back.  \"It was attempt number one!  More than that I cannot say.  Don't let the man hear.  He has noticed  nothing.  Pull up the window on your side, Petrie, and look out behind.  Good!  We've started.\"    The cab moved off with a metallic jerk, and I turned and looked back  through the little window in the rear.    \"Someone has got into another cab.  It is following ours, I think.\"    Nayland Smith lay back and laughed unmirthfully.    \"Petrie,\" he said, \"if I escape alive from this business I shall know  that I bear a charmed life.\"    I made no reply, as he pulled out the dilapidated pouch and filled his  pipe.    \"You have asked me to explain matters,\" he continued, \"and I will do so  to the best of my ability.  You no doubt wonder why a servant of the  British Government, lately stationed in Burma, suddenly appears in  London, in the character of a detective.  I am here, Petrie--and I bear  credentials from the very highest sources--because, quite by accident,  I came upon a clew.  Following it up, in the ordinary course of  routine, I obtained evidence of the existence and malignant activity of  a certain man.  At the present stage of the case I should not be  justified in terming him the emissary of an Eastern Power, but I may  say that representations are shortly to be made to that Power's  ambassador in London.\"    He paused and glanced back towards the pursuing cab.    \"There is little to fear until we arrive home,\" he said calmly.  \"Afterwards there is much.  To continue:  This man, whether a fanatic  or a duly appointed agent, is, unquestionably, the most malign and  formidable personality existing in the known world today.  He is a  linguist who speaks with almost equal facility in any of the civilized  languages, and in most of the barbaric.  He is an adept in all the arts  and sciences which a great university could teach him.  He also is an  adept in certain obscure arts and sciences which no university of  to-day can teach.  He has the brains of any three men of genius.  Petrie, he is a mental giant.\"    \"You amaze me!\" I said.    \"As to his mission among men.  Why did M. Jules Furneaux fall dead in a  Paris opera house?  Because of heart failure?  No!  Because his last  speech had shown that he held the key to the secret of Tongking.  What  became of the Grand Duke Stanislaus?  Elopement?  Suicide?  Nothing of  the kind.  He alone was fully alive to Russia's growing peril.  He  alone knew the truth about Mongolia.  Why was Sir Crichton Davey  murdered?  Because, had the work he was engaged upon ever seen the  light it would have shown him to be the only living Englishman who  understood the importance of the Tibetan frontiers.  I say to you  solemnly, Petrie, that these are but a few.  Is there a man who would  arouse the West to a sense of the awakening of the East, who would  teach the deaf to hear, the blind to see, that the millions only await  their leader?  He will die.  And this is only one phase of the devilish  campaign.  The others I can merely surmise.\"    \"But, Smith, this is almost incredible!  What perverted genius controls  this awful secret movement?\"    \"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered, with a brow  like Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven skull, and long,  magnetic eyes of the true cat-green. Invest him with all the cruel  cunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant intellect,  with all the resources of science past and present, with all the  resources, if you will, of a wealthy government--which, however,  already has denied all knowledge of his existence.  Imagine that awful  being, and you have a mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the yellow peril  incarnate in one man.\"        CHAPTER III      I SANK into an arm-chair in my rooms and gulped down a strong peg of  brandy.    \"We have been followed here,\" I said.  \"Why did you make no attempt to  throw the pursuers off the track, to have them intercepted?\"    Smith laughed.    \"Useless, in the first place.  Wherever we went, HE would find us.  And  of what use to arrest his creatures?  We could prove nothing against  them.  Further, it is evident that an attempt is to be made upon my  life to-night--and by the same means that proved so successful in the  case of poor Sir Crichton.\"    His square jaw grew truculently prominent, and he leapt stormily to his  feet, shaking his clenched fists towards the window.    \"The villain!\" he cried.  \"The fiendishly clever villain!  I suspected  that Sir Crichton was next, and I was right.  But I came too late,  Petrie!  That hits me hard, old man.  To think that I knew and yet  failed to save him!\"    He resumed his seat, smoking hard.    \"Fu-Manchu has made the blunder common to all men of unusual genius,\"  he said.  \"He has underrated his adversary.  He has not given me credit  for perceiving the meaning of the scented messages.  He has thrown away  one powerful weapon--to get such a message into my hands--and he thinks  that once safe within doors, I shall sleep, unsuspecting, and die as  Sir Crichton died.  But without the indiscretion of your charming  friend, I should have known what to expect when I receive her  'information'--which by the way, consists of a blank sheet of"]]]
