[Illustration: 015.jpg A SYRIAN TOWN AND ITS OUTSKIRTS AFTER AN EGYPTIAN  ARMY HAD PASSED THROUGH IT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Gayet.    In spite of all this, some head-strong native princes never relinquished  the hope of freedom, and no sooner had they made good the breaches in  their walls as far as they were able, than they entered once more  on this unequal contest, though at the risk of bringing irreparable  disaster on their country. The majority of them, after one such  struggle, resigned themselves to the inevitable, and fulfilled their  feudal obligations regularly. They paid their fixed contribution,  furnished rations and stores to the army when passing through their  territory, and informed the ministers at Thebes of any intrigues among  their neighbours.* Years elapsed before they could so far forget the  failure of their first attempt to regain independence, as to venture to  make a second, and expose themselves to fresh reverses.    The administration of so vast an empire entailed but a small  expenditure on the Egyptians, and required the offices of merely a few  functionaries.** The garrisons which they kept up in foreign provinces  lived on the country, and were composed mainly of light troops, archers,  a certain proportion of heavy infantry, and a few minor detachments of  chariotry dispersed among the principal fortresses.***         * We find in the _Annals_, in addition to the enumeration of       the tributes, the mention of the foraging arrangements which       the chiefs were compelled to make for the army on its       passage. We find among the tablets letters from Aziru       denouncing the intrigues of the Khati; letters also of       Ribaddu pointing out the misdeeds of Abdashirti, and other       communications of the same nature, which demonstrate the       supervision exercised by the petty Syrian princes over each       other.         ** Under Thutmosis III. we have among others \"Mir,\" or \"Nasi       situ mihatitu,\" \"governors of the northern countries,\" the       Thutii who became afterwards a hero of romance. The       individuals who bore this title held a middle rank in the       Egyptian hierarchy.         *** The archers--_pidatid, pidati, pidate_--and the       chariotry quartered in Syria are often mentioned in the Tel       el-Amarna correspondence. Steindorff has recognised the term       -ddu auitu, meaning infantry, in the word ueu, uiu, of the       Tel el-Amarna tablets.    The officers in command had orders to interfere as little as possible  in local affairs, and to leave the natives to dispute or even to fight  among themselves unhindered, so long as their quarrels did not threaten  the security of the Pharaoh.* It was never part of the policy of Egypt  to insist on her foreign subjects keeping an unbroken peace among  themselves. If, theoretically, she did not recognise the right of  private warfare, she at all events tolerated its practice. It mattered  little to her whether some particular province passed out of the  possession of a certain Eibaddu into that of a certain Aziru, or _vice  versa_, so long as both Eibaddu and Aziru remained her faithful slaves.  She never sought to repress their incessant quarrelling until such time  as it threatened to take the form of an insurrection against her own  power. Then alone did she throw off her neutrality; taking the side of  one or other of the dissentients, she would grant him, as a pledge of  help, ten, twenty, thirty, or even more archers.**         * A half at least of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence treats       of provincial wars between the kings of towns and countries       subject to Egypt--wars of Abdashirti and his son Aziru       against the cities of the Phoenician coast, wars of       Abdikhiba, or Abdi-Tabba, King of Jerusalem, against the       chiefs of the neighbouring cities.         ** Abimilki (Abisharri) demands on one occasion from the       King of Egypt ten men to defend Tyre, on another occasion       twenty; the town of Gula requisitioned thirty or forty to       guard it. Delattre thinks that these are rhetorical       expressions answering to a general word, just as if we       should say \"a handful of men\"; the difference of value in       the figures is to me a proof of their reality.    No doubt the discipline and personal courage of these veterans exercised  a certain influence on the turn of events, but they were after all a  mere handful of men, and their individual action in the combat would  scarcely ever have been sufficient to decide the result; the actual  importance of their support, in spite of their numerical inferiority,  lay in the moral weight they brought to the side on which they fought,  since they represented the whole army of the Pharaoh which lay behind  them, and their presence in a camp always ensured final success. The  vanquished party had the right of appeal to the sovereign, through whom  he might obtain a mitigation of the lot which his successful adversary  had prepared for him; it was to the interest of Egypt to keep the  balance of power as evenly as possible between the various states which  looked to her, and when she prevented one or other of the princes from  completely crushing his rivals, she was minimising the danger which  might soon arise from the vassal whom she had allowed to extend his  territory at the expense of others.    These relations gave rise to a perpetual exchange of letters and  petitions between the court of Thebes and the northern and southern  provinces, in which all the petty kings of Africa and Asia, of whatever  colour or race, set forth, either openly or covertly, their ambitions  and their fears, imploring a favour or begging for a subsidy, revealing  the real or suspected intrigues of their fellow-chiefs, and while loudly  proclaiming their own loyalty, denouncing the perfidy and the secret  projects of their neighbours. As the Ethiopian peoples did not,  apparently, possess an alphabet of their own, half of the correspondence  which concerned them was carried on in Egyptian, and written on papyrus.  In Syria, however, where Babylonian civilization maintained itself  in spite of its conquest by Thutmosis, cuneiform writing was still  employed, and tablets of dried clay.* It had, therefore, been found  necessary to establish in the Pharaoh's palace a department for this  service, in which the scribes should be competent to decipher the  Chaldaean character. Dictionaries and easy mythological texts had been  procured for their instruction, by means of which they had learned the  meaning of words and the construction of sentences. Having once mastered  the mechanism of the syllabary, they set to work to translate the  despatches, marking on the back of each the date and the place from  whence it came, and if necessary making a draft of the reply.** In these  the Pharaoh does not appear, as a rule, to have insisted on the endless  titles which we find so lavishly used in his inscriptions, but the  shortened protocol employed shows that the theory of his divinity was  as fully acknowledged by strangers as it was by his own subjects. They  greet him as their sun, the god before whom they prostrate themselves  seven times seven, while they are his slaves, his dogs, and the dust  beneath his feet.***         * A discovery made by the fellahin, in 1887, at Tel el-       Arnarna, in the rums of the palace of Khuniaton, brought to       light a portion of the correspondence between Asiatic       monarchs, whether vassals or independent of Egypt, with the       officers of Amenothes III. and IV., and with these Pharaohs       themselves.         ** Several of these registrations are still to be read on       the backs of the tablets at Berlin, London, and Gizeh.         ***The protocols of the letters of Abdashirti may be taken       as an example, or those of Abimilki to Pharaoh, sometimes       there is a development of the protocol which assumes       panegyrical features similar to those met with in Egypt.    The runners to whom these documents were entrusted, and who delivered  them with their own hand, were not, as a rule, persons of any  consideration; but for missions of grave importance \"the king's  messengers\" were employed, whose functions in time became extended to  a remarkable degree. Those who were restricted to a limited sphere  of activity were called \"the king's messengers for the regions of  the south,\" or \"the king's messengers for the regions of the north,\"  according to their proficiency in the idiom and customs of Africa or of  Asia. Others were deemed capable of undertaking missions wherever they  might be required, and were, therefore, designated by the bold title of  \"the king's messengers for all lands.\" In this case extended powers were  conferred upon them, and they were permitted to cut short the disputes  between two cities in some province they had to inspect, to excuse from  tribute, to receive presents and hostages, and even princesses destined  for the harem of the Pharaoh, and also to grant the support of troops  to such as could give adequate reason for seeking it.* Their tasks were  always of a delicate and not infrequently of a perilous nature, and  constantly exposed them to the danger of being robbed by highwaymen or  maltreated by some insubordinate vassal, at times even running the risk  of mutilation or assassination by the way.**         * The Tel el-Amarna correspondence shows the messengers in       the time of Amenothes III. and IV. as receiving tribute, as       bringing an army to the succour of a chief in difficulties,       as threatening with the anger of the Pharaoh the princes oL  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"West!\"    [Illustration: 017.jpg A CORNER OF THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a stele in the Gizeh Museum.    This crossing of the Nile was of special significance in regard to  the future of the soul of the deceased: it represented his pilgrimage  towards Abydos, to the \"Mouth of the Cleft\" which gave him access to  the other world, and it was for this reason that the name of Abydos is  associated with that of Thebes in the exclamations of the crowd. The  voices of the friends replied frequently and mournfully: \"To the West,  to the West, the land of the justified! The place which thou lovedst  weeps and is desolate!\" Then the female mourners took up the refrain,  saying: \"In peace, in peace, to the West! O honourable one, go in peace!  If it please God, when the day of Eternity shall shine, we shall see  thee, for behold thou goest to the land which mingles all men together!\"  The widow then adds her note to the concert of lamentations: \"O my  brother, O my husband, O my beloved, rest, remain in thy place, do not  depart from the terrestrial spot where thou art! Alas, thou goest away  to the ferry-boat in order to cross the stream! O sailors, do not hurry,  leave him; you, you will return to your homes, but he, he is going away  to the land of Eternity! O Osirian bark, why hast thou come to take away  from me him who has left me!\" The sailors were, of course, deaf to her  appeals, and the mummy pursued its undisturbed course towards the last  stage of its mysterious voyage.    The majority of the tombs--those which were distributed over the plain  or on the nearest spurs of the hill--were constructed on the lines of  those brick-built pyramids erected on mastabas which were very common  during the early Theban dynasties. The relative proportions of the parts  alone were modified: the mastaba, which had gradually been reduced to  an insignificant base, had now recovered its original height, while the  pyramid had correspondingly decreased, and was much reduced in size. The  chapel was constructed within the building, and the mummy-pit was sunk  to a varying depth below. The tombs ranged along the mountain-side were,  on the other hand, rock-cut, and similar to those at el-Bersheh and  Beni-Hasan.    [Illustration: 018.jpg PAINTING IN THE FIFTH TOMB OF THE KINGS TO THE  RIGHT]    The heads of wealthy families or the nobility naturally did not leave to  the last moment the construction of a sepulchre worthy of their rank and  fortune. They prided themselves on having \"finished their house which is  in the funeral valley when the morning for the hiding away of their body  should come.\" Access to these tombs was by too steep and difficult a  path to allow of oxen being employed for the transport of the mummy: the  friends or slaves of the deceased were, therefore, obliged to raise the  sarcophagus on their shoulders and bear it as best they could to the  door of the tomb.    [Illustration: 019.jpg THE FAREWELL TO THE MUMMY, AND THE DOUBLE  RECEIVED BY THE GODDESS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the paintings in the Theban       tombs.    The mummy was then placed in an upright position on a heap of sand, with  its back to the wall and facing the assistants, like the master of some  new villa who, having been accompanied by his friends to see him take  possession, turns for a moment on the threshold to take leave of  them before entering. A sacrifice, an offering, a prayer, and a fresh  outburst of grief ensued; the mourners redoubled their cries and threw  themselves upon the ground, the relatives decked the mummy with flowers  and pressed it to their bared bosoms, kissing it upon the breast and  knees. \"I am thy sister, O great one! forsake me not! Is it indeed thy  will that I should leave thee? If I go away, thou shalt be here alone,  and is there any one who will be with thee to follow thee? O thou  who lovedst to jest with me, thou art now silent, thou speakest  not!\" Whereupon the mourners again broke out in chorus: \"Lamentation,  lamentation! Make, make, make, make lamentation without ceasing as loud  as can be made. O good traveller, who takest thy way towards the land of  Eternity, thou hast been torn from us! O thou who hadst so many around  thee, thou art now in the land which bringest isolation! Thou who  lovedst to stretch thy limbs in walking, art now fettered, bound,  swathed! Thou who hadst fine stuffs in abundance, art laid in the linen  of yesterday!\" Calm in the midst of the tumult, the priest stood and  offered the incense and libation with the accustomed words: \"To thy  double, Osiris Nofirhotpu, whose voice before the great god is true!\"  This was the signal of departure, and the mummy, carried by two men,  disappeared within the tomb: the darkness of the other world had laid  hold of it, never to let it go again.    The chapel was usually divided into two chambers: one, which was of  greater width than length, ran parallel to the facade; the other, which  was longer than it was wide, stood at right angles with the former,  exactly opposite to the entrance. The decoration of these chambers  took its inspiration from the scheme which prevailed in the time of the  Memphite dynasties, but besides the usual scenes of agricultural labour,  hunting, and sacrifice, there were introduced episodes from the public  life of the deceased, and particularly the minute portrayal of the  ceremonies connected with his burial.    [Illustration: 021.jpg NICHE IN THE TOMB OF MENNA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.    These pictorial biographies are always accompanied by detailed  explanatory inscriptions; every individual endeavoured thus to show  to the Osirian judges the rank he had enjoyed here upon earth, and to  obtain in the fields of lalu the place which he claimed to be his due.    The stele was to be found at the far end of the second chamber; it was  often let in to a niche in the form of a round-headed doorway, or else  it was replaced by a group of statues, either detached or sculptured in  the rock itself, representing the occupant, his wives and children, who  took the place of the supporters of the double, formerly always hidden  within the serdab. The ceremony of the \"Opening of the Mouth\" took  place in front of the niche on the day of burial, at the moment when the  deceased, having completed his terrestrial course, entered his new home  and took possession of it for all eternity. The object of this ceremony  was, as we know, to counteract the effects of the embalming, and to  restore activity to the organs of the body whose functions had been  suspended by death. The \"man of the roll\" and his assistants, aided by  the priests, who represented the \"children of Horus,\" once more raised  the mummy into an upright position upon a heap of sand in the middle of  the chapel, and celebrated in his behalf the divine mystery instituted  by Horus for Osiris. They purified it both by ordinary and by red water,  by the incense of the south and by the alum of the north, in the same  manner as that in which the statues of the gods were purified at the  beginning of the temple sacrifices; they then set to work to awake the  deceased from his sleep: they loosened his shroud and called back the  double who had escaped from the body at the moment of the death-agony,  and restored to him the use of his arms and legs. As soon as the  sacrificial slaughterers had despatched the bull of the south, and cut  it in pieces, the priest seized the bleeding haunch, and raised it  to the lips of the mask as if to invite it to eat; but the lips still  remained closed, and refused to perform their office. The priest then  touched them with several iron instruments hafted on wooden handles,  which were supposed to possess the power of unsealing them.    [Illustration: 023a.jpg COFFIN-LID]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.    [Illustration: 023b.jpg COFFIN-LID]    The \"opening\" once effected, the double became free, and the  tomb-paintings from thenceforward ceasing to depict the mummy,  represented the double only. They portrayed it \"under the form which he  had on this earth,\" wearing the civil garb, and fulfilling his ordinary  functions. The corpse was regarded as merely the larva, to be maintained  in its integrity in order to ensure survival; but it could be relegated  without fear to the depths of the bare and naked tomb, there to remain  until the end of time, if it pleased the gods to preserve it from  robbers or archaeologists. At the period of the first Theban empire  the coffins were rectangular wooden chests, made on the models of the  limestone and granite sarcophagi, and covered with prayers taken from  the various sacred writings, especially from the \"Book of the Dead\";  during the second Theban empire, they were modified into an actual  sheath for the body, following more or less the contour of the human  figure. This external model of the deceased covered his remains, and  his figure in relief served as a lid to the coffin. The head was covered  with the full-dress wig, a tippet of white cambrio half veiled the  bosom, the petticoat fell in folds about the limbs, the feet were shod  with sandals, the arms were outstretched or were folded over the breast,  and the hands clasped various objects--either the _crux ansata_, the  buckle of the belt, the _tat_, or a garland of flowers. Sometimes, on  the contrary, the coffin was merely a conventional reproduction of  the human form. The two feet and legs were joined together, and the  modelling of the knee, calf, thigh, and stomach was only slightly  indicated in the wood. Towards the close of the XVIIIth dynasty it was  the fashion for wealthy persons to have two coffins, one fitting inside  the other, painted black or white. From the XXth dynasty onwards they  were coated with a yellowish varnish, and so covered with inscriptions  and mystic signs that each coffin"]]]
