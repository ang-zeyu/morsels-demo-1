A university, as its very name implies, ought to be an  all-embracing assemblage of higher studies, so adjusted to each other  that, in combination, they provide beginners with a good general  education; whilst, severally, they offer to more advanced students  the opportunity of doing this or that kind of specific research. In  such a well-organized university, then, how would our budding  anthropologist proceed to form a preliminary acquaintance with the  four corners of his subject? What departments must he attend in turn?  Let us draw him up a curriculum, praying meanwhile that the  multiplicity of the demands made upon him will not take away his breath  altogether. Man is a many-sided being; so there is no help for it if  anthropology also is many-sided.    For one thing, he must sit at the feet of those whose particular concern  is with pre-historic man. It is well to begin here, since thus will  the glamour of the subject sink into his soul at the start. Let him,  for instance, travel back in thought to the Europe of many thousands  of years ago, shivering under the effects of the great ice-age, yet  populous with human beings so far like ourselves that they were alive  to the advantage of a good fire, made handy tools out of stone and  wood and bone, painted animals on the walls of their caves, or engraved  them on mammoth-ivory, far more skilfully than most of us could do  now, and buried their dead in a ceremonial way that points to a belief  in a future life. Thus, too, he will learn betimes how to blend the  methods and materials of different branches of science. A human skull,  let us say, and some bones of extinct animals, and some chipped flints  are all discovered side by side some twenty feet below the level of  the soil. At least four separate authorities must be called in before  the parts of the puzzle can be fitted together.    Again, he must be taught something about race, or inherited breed,  as it applies to man. A dose of practical anatomy--that is to say,  some actual handling and measuring of the principal portions of the  human frame in its leading varieties--will enable our beginner to  appreciate the differences of outer form that distinguish, say, the  British colonist in Australia from the native \"black-fellow,\" or the  whites from the negroes, and redskins, and yellow Asiatics in the  United States. At this point, he may profitably embark on the details  of the Darwinian hypothesis of the descent of man. Let him search  amongst the manifold modern versions of the theory of human evolution  for the one that comes nearest to explaining the degrees of physical  likeness and unlikeness shown by men in general as compared with the  animals, especially the man-like apes; and again, those shown by the  men of divers ages and regions as compared with each other. Nor is  it enough for him, when thus engaged, to take note simply of physical  features--the shape of the skull, the colour of the skin, the tint  and texture of the hair, and so on. There are likewise mental characters  that seem to be bound up closely with the organism and to follow the  breed. Such are the so-called instincts, the study of which should  be helped out by excursions into the mind-history of animals, of  children, and of the insane. Moreover, the measuring and testing of  mental functions, and, in particular, of the senses, is now-a-days  carried on by means of all sorts of ingenious instruments; and some  experience of their use will be all to the good, when problems of  descent are being tackled.    Further, our student must submit to a thorough grounding in  world-geography with its physical and human sides welded firmly  together. He must be able to pick out on the map the headquarters of  all the more notable peoples, not merely as they are now, but also  as they were at various outstanding moments of the past. His next  business is to master the main facts about the natural conditions to  which each people is subjected--the climate, the conformation of land  and sea, the animals and plants. From here it is but a step to the  economic life--the food-supply, the clothing, the dwelling-places,  the principal occupations, the implements of labour. A selected list  of books of travel must be consulted. No less important is it to work  steadily through the show-cases of a good ethnological museum. Nor  will it suffice to have surveyed the world by regions. The  communications between regions--the migrations and conquests, the  trading and the borrowing of customs--must be traced and accounted  for. Finally, on the basis of their distribution, which the learner  must chart out for himself on blank maps of the world, the chief  varieties of the useful arts and appliances of man can be followed  from stage to stage of their development.    Of the special studies concerned with man the next in order might seem  to be that which deals with the various forms of human society; since,  in a sense, social organization must depend directly on material  circumstances. In another and perhaps a deeper sense, however, the  prime condition of true sociality is something else, namely, the  exclusively human gift of articulate speech. To what extent, then,  must our novice pay attention to the history of language? Speculation  about its far-off origins is now-a-days rather out of fashion. Moreover,  language is no longer supposed to provide, by itself at any rate, and  apart from other clues, a key to the endless riddles of racial descent.  What is most needed, then, is rather some elementary instruction  concerning the organic connection between language and thought, and  concerning their joint development as viewed against the background  of the general development of society. And, just as words and thoughts  are essentially symbols, so there are also gesture-symbols and written  symbols, whilst again another set of symbols is in use for counting.  All these pre-requisites of human intercourse may be conveniently  taken together.    Coming now to the analysis of the forms of society, the beginner must  first of all face the problem: \"What makes a people one?\" Neither blood,  nor territory, nor language, but only the fact of being more or less  compactly organized in a political society, will be found to yield  the unifying principle required. Once the primary constitution of the  body politic has been made out, a limit is set up, inside of which  a number of fairly definite forms of grouping offer themselves for  examination; whilst outside of it various social relationships of a  vaguer kind have also to be considered. Thus, amongst institutions  of the internal kind, the family by itself presents a wide field of  research; though in certain cases it is liable to be overshadowed by  some other sort of organization, such as, notably, the clan. Under  the same rubric fall the many forms of more or less voluntary  association, economic, religious, and so forth. On the other hand,  outside the circle of the body politic there are, at all known stages  of society, mutual understandings that regulate war, trade, travel,  the celebration of common rites, the interchange of ideas. Here, then,  is an abundance of types of human association, to be first scrutinized  separately, and afterwards considered in relation to each other.    Closely connected with the previous subject is the history of law.  Every type of association, in a way, has its law, whereby its members  are constrained to fulfil a certain set of obligations. Thus our  student will pass on straight from the forms of society to the most  essential of their functions. The fact that, amongst the less civilized  peoples, the law is uncodified and merely customary, whilst the  machinery for enforcing it is, though generally effective enough, yet  often highly indefinite and occasional, makes the tracing of the growth  of legal institutions from their rudiments no less vitally important,  though it makes it none the easier. The history of authority is a  strictly kindred topic. Legislating and judging on the one hand, and  governing on the other, are different aspects of the same general  function. In accordance, then, with the order already indicated, law  and government as administered by the political society in the person  of its representatives, chiefs, elders, war-lords, priest-kings, and  so forth, must first be examined; then the jurisdiction and discipline  of subordinate bodies, such as the family and the clan, or again the  religious societies, trade guilds, and the rest; then, lastly, the  international conventions, with the available means of ensuring their  observance.    Again, the history of religion is an allied theme of far-reaching  interest. For the understanding of the ruder forms of society it may  even be said to furnish the master-key. At this stage, religion is  the mainstay of law and government. The constraining force of custom  makes itself felt largely through a magnifying haze of mystic  sanctions; whilst, again, the position of a leader of society rests  for the most part on the supernormal powers imputed to him. Religion  and magic, then, must be carefully studied if we would understand how  the various persons and bodies that exercise authority are assisted,  or else hindered, in their efforts to maintain social discipline. Apart  from this fundamental inquiry, there is another, no less important  in its way, to which the study of religion and magic opens up a path.  This is the problem how reflection manages as it were to double human  experience, by setting up beside the outer world of sense an inner  world of thought-relations. Now constructive imagination is the queen  of those mental functions which meet in what we loosely term \"thought\";  and imagination is ever most active where, on the outer fringe of the  mind's routine work, our inarticulate questionings radiate into the  unknown. When the genius has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17287"],[0,"History of France (#3)"],[1,"1214, thus establishing the power of the crown. Two years  later, Louis the Lion, who had married John's niece, Blanche of Castile,  was invited by the English barons to become their king on John's  refusing to be bound by the Great Charter; and Philip saw his son  actually in possession of London at the time of the death of the last  of the sons of his enemy, Henry II. On John's death, however, the barons  preferred his child to the French prince, and fell away from Louis, who  was forced to return to France.      8. The Albigenses (1203--1240).--The next great step in the building  up of the French kingdom was made by taking advantage of a religious  strife in the south. The lands near the Mediterranean still had much of  the old Roman cultivation, and also of the old corruption, and here  arose a sect called the Albigenses, who held opinions other than those  of the Church on the origin of evil. Pope Innocent III., after sending  some of the order of friars freshly established by the Spaniard,  Dominic, to preach to them in vain, declared them as great enemies of  the faith as Mahometans, and proclaimed a crusade against them and their  chief supporter, Raymond, Count of Toulouse. Shrewd old King Philip  merely permitted this crusade; but the dislike of the north of France to  the south made hosts of adventurers flock to the banner of its leader,  Simon de Montfort, a Norman baron, devout and honourable, but harsh and  pitiless. Dreadful execution was done; the whole country was laid waste,  and Raymond reduced to such distress that Peter I., King of Aragon, who  was regarded as the natural head of the southern races, came to his  aid, but was defeated and slain at the battle of Muret. After this  Raymond was forced to submit, but such hard terms were forced on him  that his people revolted. His country was granted to De Montfort, who  laid siege to Toulouse, and was killed before he could take the city.  The war was then carried on by _Louis the Lion_, who had succeeded his  father as Louis VIII. in 1223, though only to reign three years, as he  died of a fever caught in a southern campaign in 1226. His widow,  Blanche, made peace in the name of her son, _Louis IX._, and Raymond was  forced to give his only daughter in marriage to one of her younger sons.  On their death, the county of Toulouse lapsed to the crown, which thus  became possessor of all southern France, save Guienne, which still  remained to the English kings. But the whole of the district once  peopled by the Albigenses had been so much wasted as never to recover  its prosperity, and any cropping up of their opinions was guarded  against by the establishment of the Inquisition, which appointed  Dominican friars to _inquire_ into and exterminate all that differed  from the Church. At the same time the order of St. Francis did much to  instruct and quicken the consciences of the people; and at the  universities--especially that of Paris--a great advance both in thought  and learning was made. Louis IX.'s confessor, Henry de Sorbonne,  founded, for the study of divinity, the college which was known by his  name, and whose decisions were afterwards received as of paramount  authority.      9. The Parliament of Paris.--France had a wise ruler in Blanche, and a  still better one in her son, _Louis IX._, who is better known as _St.  Louis_, and who was a really good and great man. He was the first to  establish the Parliament of Paris--a court consisting of the great  feudal vassals, lay and ecclesiastical, who held of the king direct, and  who had to try all causes. They much disliked giving such attendance,  and a certain number of men trained to the law were added to them to  guide the decisions. The Parliament was thus only a court of justice and  an office for registering wills and edicts. The representative assembly  of France was called the States-General, and consisted of all estates of  the realm, but was only summoned in time of emergency. Louis IX. was the  first king to bring nobles of the highest rank to submit to the judgment  of Parliament when guilty of a crime. Enguerrand de Coucy, one of the  proudest nobles of France, who had hung two Flemish youths for killing a  rabbit, was sentenced to death. The penalty was commuted, but the  principle was established. Louis's uprightness and wisdom gained him  honour and love everywhere, and he was always remembered as sitting  under the great oak at Vincennes, doing equal justice to rich and poor.  Louis was equally upright in his dealings with foreign powers. He would  not take advantage of the weakness of Henry III. of England to attack  his lands in Guienne, though he maintained the right of France to  Normandy as having been forfeited by King John. So much was he respected  that he was called in to judge between Henry and his barons, respecting  the oaths exacted from the king by the Mad Parliament. His decision in  favour of Henry was probably an honest one; but he was misled by the  very different relations of the French and English kings to their  nobles, who in France maintained lawlessness and violence, while in  England they were struggling for law and order. Throughout the struggles  between the Popes and the Emperor Frederick II., Louis would not be  induced to assist in a persecution of the Emperor which he considered  unjust, nor permit one of his sons to accept the kingdom of Apulia and  Sicily, when the Pope declared that Frederick had forfeited it. He could  not, however, prevent his brother Charles, Count of Anjou, from  accepting it; for Charles had married Beatrice, heiress of the imperial  fief of Provence, and being thus independent of his brother Louis, was  able to establish a branch of the French royal family on the throne at  Naples. The reign of St. Louis was a time of much progress and  improvement. There were great scholars and thinkers at all the  universities. Romance and poetry were flourishing, and influencing  people's habits, so that courtesy, _i.e._ the manners taught in castle  courts, was softening the demeanour of knights and nobles. Architecture  was at its most beautiful period, as is seen, above all, in the Sainte  Chapelle at Paris. This was built by Louis IX. to receive a gift of the  Greek Emperor, namely, a thorn, which was believed to be from the crown  of thorns. It is one of the most perfect buildings in existence.      10. Crusade of Louis IX.--Unfortunately, Louis, during a severe  illness, made a vow to go on a crusade. His first fulfilment of this vow  was made early in his reign, in 1250, when his mother was still alive to  undertake the regency. His attempt was to attack the heart of the  Saracen power in Egypt, and he effected a landing and took the city of  Damietta. There he left his queen, and advanced on Cairo; but near  Mansourah he found himself entangled in the canals of the Nile, and with  a great army of Mamelukes in front. A ford was found, and the English  Earl of Salisbury, who had brought a troop to join the crusade, advised  that the first to cross should wait and guard the passage of the next.  But the king's brother, Robert, Count of Artois, called this cowardice.  The earl was stung, and declared he would be as forward among the foe as  any Frenchman. They both charged headlong, were enclosed by the enemy,  and slain; and though the king at last put the Mamelukes to flight, his  loss was dreadful. The Nile rose and cut off his return. He lost great  part of his troops from sickness, and was horribly harassed by the  Mamelukes, who threw among his host a strange burning missile, called  Greek fire; and he was finally forced to surrender himself as a prisoner  at Mansourah, with all his army. He obtained his release by giving up  Damietta, and paying a heavy ransom. After twenty years, in 1270, he  attempted another crusade, which was still more unfortunate, for he  landed at Tunis to wait for his brother to arrive from Sicily,  apparently on some delusion of favourable dispositions on the part of  the Bey. Sickness broke out in the camp, and the king, his daughter, and  his third son all died of fever; and so fatal was the expedition, that  his son Philip III. returned to France escorting five coffins, those of  his father, his brother, his sister and her husband, and his own wife  and child.      11. Philip the Fair.--The reign of _Philip III._ was very short. The  insolence and cruelty of the Provencals in Sicily had provoked the  natives to a massacre known as the Sicilian Vespers, and they then  called in the King of Aragon, who finally obtained the island, as a  separate kingdom from that on the Italian mainland where Charles of  Anjou and his descendants still reigned. While fighting his uncle's  battles on the Pyrenees, and besieging Gerona, Philip III. caught a  fever, and died on his way home in 1285. His successor, _Philip IV.,  called the Fair_, was crafty, cruel, and greedy, and made the Parliament  of Paris the instrument of his violence and exactions, which he carried  out in the name of the law. To prevent Guy de Dampierre, Count of  Flanders, from marrying his daughter to the son of Edward I. of England,  he invited her and her father to his court, and threw them both into  prison, while he offered his own daughter Isabel to Edward of Carnarvon  in her stead. The Scottish wars prevented Edward I. from taking up the  cause of Guy; but the Pope, Boniface VIII., a man of a fierce temper,  though of a great age, loudly called on Philip to do justice to  Flanders, and likewise blamed in unmeasured terms his exactions from the  clergy, his debasement of the coinage, and his foul and vicious life.  Furious abuse passed on both sides. Philip availed himself of a flaw in  the Pope's election to threaten him with deposition, and in return was  excommunicated. He then sent a French knight named William de Nogaret,  with Sciarra Colonna, a turbulent Roman, the hereditary enemy of  Boniface, and a band of savage"]]]
