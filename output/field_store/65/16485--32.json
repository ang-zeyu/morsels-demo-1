(#3)"],[1,"this is obvious, it is even more obvious that  there is something radically wrong with the prevalent systems of  musical instruction. It is because of a plentiful lack of knowledge  that so much that is written on music is without meaning, and that  the most foolish kind of rhapsody, so it show a collocation of fine  words, is permitted to masquerade as musical criticism and even  analysis. People like to read about music, and the books of a certain  English clergyman have had a sale of stupendous magnitude  notwithstanding they are full of absurdities. The clergyman has a  multitudinous companionship, moreover, among novelists, essayists, and  poets whose safety lies in more or less fantastic generalization when  they come to talk about music. How they flounder when they come to  detail! It was Charles Lamb who said, in his \"Chapter on Ears,\" that  in voices he could not distinguish a soprano from a tenor, and could  only contrive to guess at the thorough-bass from its being  \"supereminently harsh and disagreeable;\" yet dear old Elia may be  forgiven, since his confounding the bass voice with a system of  musical short-hand is so delightful a proof of the ignorance he was  confessing.    [Sidenote: _Literary realism and musical terminology._]    But what shall the troubled critics say to Tennyson's orchestra  consisting of a flute, violin, and bassoon? Or to Coleridge's \"_loud_  bassoon,\" which made the wedding-guest to beat his breast? Or to Mrs.  Harriet Beecher Stowe's pianist who played \"with an airy and bird-like  touch?\" Or to our own clever painter-novelist who, in \"Snubbin'  through Jersey,\" has Brushes bring out his violoncello and play \"the  symphonies of Beethoven\" to entertain his fellow canal-boat  passengers? The tendency toward realism, or \"veritism,\" as it is  called, has brought out a rich crop of blunders. It will not do to  have a character in a story simply sing or play something; we must  have the names of composers and compositions. The genial gentleman who  enriched musical literature with arrangements of Beethoven's  symphonies for violoncello without accompaniment has since  supplemented this feat by creating a German fiddler who, when he  thinks himself unnoticed, plays a sonata for violin and contralto  voice; Professor Brander Matthews permits one of his heroines to sing  Schumann's \"Warum?\" and one of his heroes plays \"The Moonlight  Concerto;\" one of Ouida's romantic creatures spends hours at an organ  \"playing the grand old masses of Mendelssohn;\" in \"Moths\" the tenor  never wearies of singing certain \"exquisite airs of Palestrina,\" which  recalls the fact that an indignant correspondent of a St. Louis  newspaper, protesting against the Teutonism and heaviness of an  orchestra conductor's programmes, demanded some of the \"lighter\" works  of \"Berlioz and Palestrina.\"    [Sidenote: _A popular need._]    Alas! these things and the many others equally amusing which Mr. G.  Sutherland Edwards long ago catalogued in an essay on \"The Literary  Maltreatment of Music\" are but evidences that even cultured folk have  not yet learned to talk correctly about the art which is practised  most widely. There is a greater need than pianoforte teachers and  singing teachers, and that is a numerous company of writers and  talkers who shall teach the people how to listen to music so that it  shall not pass through their heads like a vast tonal phantasmagoria,  but provide the varied and noble delights contemplated by the  composers.    [Sidenote: _A warning against writers._]    [Sidenote: _Pedants and rhapsodists._]    Ungracious as it might appear, it may yet not be amiss, therefore, at  the very outset of an inquiry into the proper way in which to listen  to music, to utter a warning against much that is written on the art.  As a rule it will be found that writers on music are divided into two  classes, and that neither of these classes can do much good. Too often  they are either pedants or rhapsodists. This division is wholly  natural. Music has many sides and is a science as well as an art. Its  scientific side is that on which the pedant generally approaches it.  He is concerned with forms and rules, with externals, to the  forgetting of that which is inexpressibly nobler and higher. But the  pedants are not harmful, because they are not interesting; strictly  speaking, they do not write for the public at all, but only for their  professional colleagues. The harmful men are the foolish rhapsodists  who take advantage of the fact that the language of music is  indeterminate and evanescent to talk about the art in such a way as to  present themselves as persons of exquisite sensibilities rather than  to direct attention to the real nature and beauty of music itself. To  them I shall recur in a later chapter devoted to musical criticism,  and haply point out the difference between good and bad critics and  commentators from the view-point of popular need and popular  opportunity.          II    _Recognition of Musical Elements_      [Sidenote: _The nature of music._]    Music is dual in its nature; it is material as well as spiritual. Its  material side we apprehend through the sense of hearing, and  comprehend through the intellect; its spiritual side reaches us  through the fancy (or imagination, so it be music of the highest  class), and the emotional part of us. If the scope and capacity of the  art, and the evolutionary processes which its history discloses (a  record of which is preserved in its nomenclature), are to be  understood, it is essential that this duality be kept in view. There  is something so potent and elemental in the appeal which music makes  that it is possible to derive pleasure from even an unwilling hearing  or a hearing unaccompanied by effort at analysis; but real  appreciation of its beauty, which means recognition of the qualities  which put it in the realm of art, is conditioned upon intelligent  hearing. The higher the intelligence, the keener will be the  enjoyment, if the former be directed to the spiritual side as well as  the material.    [Sidenote: _Necessity of intelligent hearing._]    So far as music is merely agreeably co-ordinated sounds, it may be  reduced to mathematics and its practice to handicraft. But recognition  of design is a condition precedent to the awakening of the fancy or  the imagination, and to achieve such recognition there must be  intelligent hearing in the first instance. For the purposes of this  study, design may be held to be Form in its primary stages, the  recognition of which is possible to every listener who is fond of  music; it is not necessary that he be learned in the science. He need  only be willing to let an intellectual process, which will bring its  own reward, accompany the physical process of hearing.    [Sidenote: _Tones and musical material._]    Without discrimination it is impossible to recognize even the crude  materials of music, for the first step is already a co-ordination of  those materials. A tone becomes musical material only by association  with another tone. We might hear it alone, study its quality, and  determine its degree of acuteness or gravity (its pitch, as musicians  say), but it can never become music so long as it remains isolated.  When we recognize that it bears certain relationships with other tones  in respect of time or tune (to use simple terms), it has become for us  musical material. We do not need to philosophize about the nature of  those relationships, but we must recognize their existence.    [Sidenote: _The beginnings of Form._]    Thus much we might hear if we were to let music go through our heads  like water through a sieve. Yet the step from that degree of  discrimination to a rudimentary analysis of Form is exceedingly short,  and requires little more than a willingness to concentrate the  attention and exercise the memory. Everyone is willing to do that much  while looking at a picture. Who would look at a painting and rest  satisfied with the impression made upon the sense of sight by the  colors merely? No one, surely. Yet so soon as we look, so as to  discriminate between the outlines, to observe the relationship of  figure to figure, we are indulging in intellectual exercise. If this  be a condition precedent to the enjoyment of a picture (and it plainly  is), how much more so is it in the case of music, which is intangible  and evanescent, which cannot pause a moment for our contemplation  without ceasing to be?    [Sidenote: _Comparison with a model not possible._]    There is another reason why we must exercise intelligence in  listening, to which I have already alluded in the first chapter. Our  appreciation of beauty in the plastic arts is helped by the  circumstance that the critical activity is largely a matter of  comparison. Is the picture or the statue a good copy of the object  sought to be represented? Such comparison fails us utterly in music,  which copies nothing that is tangibly present in the external world.    [Sidenote: _What degree of knowledge is necessary?_]    [Sidenote: _The Elements._]    [Sidenote: _Value of memory._]    It is then necessary to associate the intellect with sense perception  in listening to music. How far is it essential that the intellectual  process shall go? This book being for the untrained, the question  might be put thus: With how little knowledge of the science can an  intelligent listener get along? We are concerned only with his  enjoyment of music or, better, with an effort to increase it without  asking him to become a musician. If he is fond of the art it is more  than likely that the capacity to discriminate sufficiently to  recognize the elements out of which music is made has come to him  intuitively. Does he recognize that musical tones are related to each  other in respect of time and pitch? Then it shall not be difficult for  him to recognize the three elements on which music rests--Melody,  Harmony, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#3)"],[1,"Boulanger might have chosen and treated according to his own special  talent; and this gives it a character of its own and an individual  charm.        _Voyage en Italie_ (Paris, new ed., 1884).          THE BIRTH OF VENUS    (_BOTTICELLI_)    WALTER PATER      In Leonardo's treatise on painting only one contemporary is mentioned by  name--Sandro Botticelli. This pre-eminence may be due to chance only,  but to some will rather appear a result of deliberate judgment; for  people have begun to find out the charm of Botticelli's work, and his  name, little known in the last century, is quietly becoming important.  In the middle of the Fifteenth Century he had already anticipated much  of that meditative subtlety which is sometimes supposed peculiar to the  great imaginative workmen of its close. Leaving the simple religion  which had occupied the followers of Giotto for a century, and the simple  naturalism which had grown out of it, a thing of birds and flowers only,  he sought inspiration in what to him were works of the modern world, the  writings of Dante and Boccaccio, and in new readings of his own of  classical stories; or if he painted religious subjects, painted them  with an undercurrent of original sentiment which touches you as the real  matter of the picture through the veil of its ostensible subject. What  is the peculiar sensation, what is the peculiar quality of pleasure  which his work has the property of exciting in us, and which we cannot  get elsewhere? For this, especially when he has to speak of a  comparatively unknown artist, is always the chief question which a  critic has to answer.    In an age when the lives of artists were full of adventure, his life is  almost colourless. Criticism indeed has cleared away much of the gossip  which Vasari accumulated, has touched the legend of Lippo and Lucrezia,  and rehabilitated the character of Andrea del Castagno; but in  Botticelli's case there is no legend to dissipate. He did not even go by  his true name: Sandro is a nickname, and his true name is Filipepi,  Botticelli being only the name of the goldsmith who first taught him  art. Only two things happened to him, two things which he shared with  other artists--he was invited to Rome to paint in the Sistine Chapel,  and he fell in later life under the influence of Savonarola, passing  apparently almost out of men's sight in a sort of religious melancholy  which lasted till his death in 1515, according to the received date.  Vasari says that he plunged into the study of Dante, and even wrote a  comment on the _Divine Comedy_. But it seems strange that he should have  lived on inactive so long; and one almost wishes that some document  might come to light which, fixing the date of his death earlier, might  relieve one, in thinking of him, of his dejected old age.    [Illustration: THE BIRTH OF VENUS.          _Botticelli._]    He is before all things a poetical painter, blending the charm of story  and sentiment, the medium of the art of poetry, with the charm of line  and colour, the medium of abstract painting. So he becomes the  illustrator of Dante. In a few rare examples of the edition of 1481, the  blank spaces left at the beginning of every canto for the hand of the  illuminator have been filled as far as the nineteenth canto of the  _Inferno_, with impressions of engraved plates, seemingly by way of  experiment, for in the copy in the Bodleian Library, one of the three  impressions it contains has been printed upside down and much awry in  the midst of the luxurious printed page. Giotto, and the followers of  Giotto, with their almost childish religious aim, had not learned to put  that weight of meaning into outward things, light, colour, every-day  gesture, which the poetry of the _Divine Comedy_ involves, and before  the Fifteenth Century Dante could hardly have found an illustrator.  Botticelli's illustrations are crowded with incident, blending with a  naive carelessness of pictorial propriety three phases of the same scene  into one plate. The grotesques, so often a stumbling-block to painters  who forget that the words of a poet, which only feebly present an image  to the mind, must be lowered in key when translated into form, make one  regret that he has not rather chosen for illustration the more subdued  imagery of the _Purgatorio_. Yet in the scene of those who go down quick  into hell there is an invention about the fire taking hold on the  up-turned soles of the feet, which proves that the design is no mere  translation of Dante's words, but a true painter's vision; while the  scene of the Centaurs wins one at once, for, forgetful of the actual  circumstances of their appearance, Botticelli has gone off with delight  on the thought of the Centaurs themselves, bright small creatures of the  woodland, with arch baby faces and mignon forms, drawing tiny bows.    Botticelli lived in a generation of naturalists, and he might have been  a mere naturalist among them. There are traces enough in his work of  that alert sense of outward things which, in the pictures of that  period, fills the lawns with delicate living creatures, and the  hill-sides with pools of water, and the pools of water with flowering  reeds. But this was not enough for him; he is a visionary painter, and  in his visionariness he resembles Dante. Giotto, the tried companion of  Dante, Masaccio, Ghirlandaio even, do but transcribe with more or less  refining the outward image; they are dramatic, not visionary painters;  they are almost impassive spectators of the action before them. But the  genius of which Botticelli is the type usurps the data before it as the  exponents of ideas, moods, visions of its own; with this interest it  plays fast and loose with those data, rejecting some and isolating  others, and always combining them anew. To him, as to Dante, the scene,  the colour, the outward image or gesture, comes with all its incisive  and importunate reality; but awakes in him, moreover, by some subtle  structure of his own, a mood which it awakes in no one else, of which it  is the double or repetition, and which it clothes, that all may share  it, with sensuous circumstances.    But he is far enough from accepting the conventional orthodoxy of Dante  which, referring all human action to the easy formula of purgatory,  heaven, and hell, leaves an insoluble element of prose in the depths of  Dante's poetry. One picture of his, with the portrait of the donor,  Matteo Palmieri, below, had the credit or discredit of attracting some  shadow of ecclesiastical censure. This Matteo Palmieri--two dim figures  move under that name in contemporary history--was the reputed author of  a poem, still unedited, _La Citta Divina_, which represented the human  race as an incarnation of those angels who, in the revolt of Lucifer,  were neither for God nor for his enemies, a fantasy of that earlier  Alexandrian philosophy, about which the Florentine intellect in that  century was so curious. Botticelli's picture may have been only one of  those familiar compositions in which religious reverie has recorded its  impressions of the various forms of beatified existence--_Glorias_, as  they were called, like that in which Giotto painted the portrait of  Dante; but somehow it was suspected of embodying in a picture the  wayward dream of Palmieri, and the chapel where it hung was closed.  Artists so entire as Botticelli are usually careless about philosophical  theories, even when the philosopher is a Florentine of the Fifteenth  Century, and his work a poem in _terza rima_. But Botticelli, who wrote  a commentary on Dante and became the disciple of Savonarola, may well  have let such theories come and go across him. True or false, the story  interprets much of the peculiar sentiment with which he infuses his  profane and sacred persons, comely, and in a certain sense like angels,  but with a sense of displacement or loss about them--the wistfulness of  exiles conscious of a passion and energy greater than any known issue of  them explains, which runs through all his varied work with a sentiment  of ineffable melancholy.    So just what Dante scorns as unworthy alike of heaven and hell,  Botticelli accepts, that middle world in which men take no side in great  conflicts, and decide no great causes, and make great refusals. He thus  sets for himself the limits within which art, undisturbed by any moral  ambition, does its most sincere and surest work. His interest is neither  in the untempered goodness of Angelico's saints, nor the untempered evil  of Orcagna's _Inferno_; but with men and women in their mixed and  uncertain condition, always attractive, clothed sometimes by passion  with a character of loveliness and energy, but saddened perpetually by  the shadow upon them of the great things from which they shrink. His  morality is all sympathy; and it is this sympathy, conveying into his  work somewhat more than is usual of the true complexion of humanity,  which makes him, visionary as he is, so forcible a realist.    It is this which gives to his Madonnas their unique expression and  charm. He has worked out in them a distinct and peculiar type, definite  enough in his own mind, for he has painted it over and over again,  sometimes one might think almost mechanically, as a pastime during that  dark period when his thoughts were so heavy upon him. Hardly any  collection of note is without one of these circular pictures, into which  the attendant angels depress their heads so naively. Perhaps you have  sometimes wondered why those peevish-looking Madonnas, conformed to no  acknowledged or obvious type of beauty, attract you more and more, and  often come back to you when the Sistine Madonna and the virgins of Fra  Angelico are forgotten. At first, contrasting them with those, you may  have thought that there was even something in them mean or abject, for  the abstract lines of the face have little nobleness and the colour"]]]
