Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable  Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my  life, was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world.    But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for  repose.  I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my  friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and  precious collections--but nothing could keep me back!  I forgot  all--fatigue, friends and collections--and accepted without hesitation  the offer of the American Government.    \"Besides,\" thought I, \"all roads lead back to Europe; and the unicorn  may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of France.  This  worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe (for  my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard  of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History.\" But in the  meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,  to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.    \"Conseil,\" I called in an impatient voice.    Conseil was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had  accompanied me in all my travels.  I liked him, and he returned the  liking well.  He was quiet by nature, regular from principle, zealous  from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of  life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service required of  him; and, despite his name, never giving advice--even when asked for it.    Conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.  Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never  make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might  be, or however far away, whether China or Congo.  Besides all this, he  had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no  nerves; good morals are understood.  This boy was thirty years old, and  his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty.  May I be excused  for saying that I was forty years old?    But Conseil had one fault:  he was ceremonious to a degree, and would  never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes  provoking.    \"Conseil,\" said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make  preparations for my departure.    Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy.  As a rule, I never asked him  if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but  this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the  enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of  sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell.  Here there was matter for  reflection even to the most impassive man in the world.  What would  Conseil say?    \"Conseil,\" I called a third time.    Conseil appeared.    \"Did you call, sir?\" said he, entering.    \"Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too.  We leave in  two hours.\"    \"As you please, sir,\" replied Conseil, quietly.    \"Not an instant to lose; lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,  coats, shirts, and stockings--without counting, as many as you can, and  make haste.\"    \"And your collections, sir?\" observed Conseil.    \"They will keep them at the hotel.\"    \"We are not returning to Paris, then?\" said Conseil.    \"Oh! certainly,\" I answered, evasively, \"by making a curve.\"    \"Will the curve please you, sir?\"    \"Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all.  We  take our passage in the Abraham, Lincoln.\"    \"As you think proper, sir,\" coolly replied Conseil.    \"You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster--the famous narwhal.  We are going to purge it from the seas.  A glorious mission, but a  dangerous one!  We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can be  very capricious.  But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain  who is pretty wide-awake.\"    Our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately.  I  hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors  conducted me to the poop, where I found myself in the presence of a  good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me.    \"Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?\" said he.    \"Himself,\" replied I. \"Commander Farragut?\"    \"You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you.\"    I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.    The Abraham Lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new  destination.  She was a frigate of great speed, fitted with  high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.  Under this the Abraham Lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly  eighteen knots and a third an hour--a considerable speed, but,  nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean.    The interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical  qualities.  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after  part, opening upon the gunroom.    \"We shall be well off here,\" said I to Conseil.    \"As well, by your honour's leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a  whelk,\" said Conseil.    I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the  poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.    At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be  cast loose which held the Abraham Lincoln to the pier of Brooklyn.  So  in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the frigate would have sailed  without me.  I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and  incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some  suspicion.    But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the  seas in which the animal had been sighted.  He sent for the engineer.    \"Is the steam full on?\" asked he.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the engineer.    \"Go ahead,\" cried Commander Farragut.        CHAPTER IV    NED LAND    Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded.  His vessel and he were one.  He was the soul of it.  On the question of  the monster there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the  existence of the animal to be disputed on board.  He believed in it, as  certain good women believe in the leviathan--by faith, not by reason.  The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it.  Either  Captain Farragut would kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the  captain.  There was no third course.    The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief.  They were  ever chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a  meeting, watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean.  More than  one took up his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have  cursed such a berth under any other circumstances.  As long as the sun  described its daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose  feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render  it unbearable; still the Abraham Lincoln had not yet breasted the  suspected waters of the Pacific.  As to the ship's company, they  desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist  it on board, and despatch it.  They watched the sea with eager  attention.    Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand  dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he  cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.    I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the Abraham Lincoln.    For my own part I was not behind the others, and, left to no one my  share of daily observations.  The frigate might have been called the  Argus, for a hundred reasons.  Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to  protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us  all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on  board.    I have said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided his ship with  every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean.  No whaler had ever  been better armed.  We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon  thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the  explosive balls of the duck-gun.  On the forecastle lay the perfection  of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in  the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867.  This  precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical  projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.    Thus the Abraham Lincoln wanted for no means of destruction; and, what  was better still she had on board Ned Land, the prince of harpooners.    Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who  knew no equal in his dangerous occupation.  Skill, coolness, audacity,  and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning  whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon.    Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six  feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,  and very passionate when contradicted.  His person attracted attention,  but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular  expression to his face.    Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little  communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain  liking for me.  My nationality drew him to me, no doubt.  It was an  opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of  Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces.  The  harpooner's family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe  of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.    Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved  to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas.  He related  his fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his  recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to  a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#3)"],[1,"during the process  of hardening of the cuticle, they rapidly increase in size, blood and  air being forced through the nervures, so that the wings attaining their  full expanse and firmness, become suited for the function of flight.    [4] The convenient term 'instar' has been proposed by Fischer and  advocated by Sharp (1895) for the form assumed by an insect during a  stage of its life-story. Thus the creature as hatched from the egg is  the _first instar_, after the first moult it has become the _second  instar_, and so on, the number of moults being always one less than the  number of instars.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Nymph of Locust (_Schistocera americana_) with  distinct wing-rudiments. After Howard, _Insect Life_, vol. VII.]    The changes through which these insects pass are therefore largely  connected with the development of the wings. It is noteworthy that in an  immature cockroach the entire dorsal cuticle is hard and firm. In the  adult, however, while the cuticle of the prothorax remains firm, that of  the two hinder thoracic and of all the abdominal segments is somewhat  thin and delicate on the dorsal aspect. It needs not now to be  resistant, because it is covered by the two firm forewings, which shield  and protect it, except when the insect is flying. There are, indeed,  slight changes in other structures not directly connected with the  wings. In a young grasshopper, for example, the feelers are relatively  stouter than in the adult, and the prothorax does not show the  specifically distinctive shape with its definite keels and furrows.  Changes in the secondary sexual characters may also be noticed. For  instance, in an immature cockroach both male and female carry a pair of  jointed tail-feelers or cercopods on the tenth abdominal segment, and a  pair of unjointed limbs or stylets on the ninth. In the adult stage,  both sexes possess cercopods, but the males only have stylets, those of  the female disappearing at the final moult.    Reviewing the main features of the life-story of a grasshopper or  cockroach, we notice that there is no marked or sudden change of form.  The newly-hatched insect resembles generally its parent, except that it  has no wings. Wing-rudiments appear, however, in an early instar as  visible outgrowths on the thoracic segments, and become larger after  each moult. All through its various stages the immature insect--_nymph_  as it is called--lives in the same kind of situations and on the same  kind of food as its parent, and it is all along active and lively,  undergoing no resting period like the pupal stage in the transformation  of the butterfly.    One interesting and suggestive fact remains to be mentioned. There are  grasshoppers and cockroaches in which the changes are even less than  those just sketched, because the wings remain, even in the adult, in a  rudimentary state (as for example in the female of the common kitchen  cockroach, _Blatta orientalis_, see fig. 4 _a_), or are never developed  at all. Such exceptional winglessness in members of a winged family can  only be explained by the recognition of a life-story, not merely in the  individual but in the race. We cannot doubt that the ancestors of these  wingless insects possessed wings, which in the course of time have been  lost by the whole species or by the members of the female sex. It is  generally assumed that this loss has been gradual, and so in many cases  it probably may have been. But there are species of insects in which  some generations are winged and others wingless; a winged mother gives  birth to wingless offspring, and a wingless parent to young with  well-developed wings. Such discontinuity in the life-story of a single  generation forces us to recognise the possibility of similar sudden  mutations in the course of that age-long process of evolution to which  the facts of insect growth, and indeed of all animal development, bear  striking testimony.          CHAPTER III    THE LIFE-STORIES OF SOME SUCKING INSECTS      We may now turn our attention to some examples of the remarkable  alternation of winged and wingless generations in the yearly life-cycle  of the same species, mentioned at the end of the last chapter.  Cockroaches and grasshoppers belong to an order of insects, the  Orthoptera[5], characterised by firm forewings and biting jaws; in all  of them the change of form during the life-history is comparatively  slight. A great contrast to those insects in the structure of the  mouth-parts is presented by the Hemiptera, an order including the bugs,  pond-skaters, cicads, plant-lice, and scale-insects. These all have an  elongated, grooved labium projecting from the head in form of a beak,  within which work, to and fro, the slender needle-like mandibles and  maxillae by means of which the insect pierces holes through the skin of  a leaf or an animal, and is thus enabled to suck a meal of sap or blood,  according to its mode of life. In many Hemiptera--the various families  of bugs both aquatic and terrestrial, for example--the life-history is  nearly as simple as that of a cockroach. It is the family of the  plant-lice (Aphidae) that affords typical illustrations of that  alternation of generations to which reference has been made.    [5] See outline classification of insects, p. 122.    The yearly cycle of the common Aphids of the apple tree has been lately  worked out in detail by J.B. Smith (1900) and E.D. Sanderson (1902). In  late autumn tiny wingless males and females are found in large numbers  on the withered leaves. The sexes pair together, and the females lay  their relatively large, smooth, hard-coated black eggs on the twigs;  these resistant eggs carry the species safely over the winter. At  springtide, when the leaves begin to sprout from the opening buds the  aphid eggs are hatched, and the young insects after a series of moults,  through which hardly any change of form is apparent, all grow into  wingless 'stem-mothers' much larger than the egg-laying females of the  autumn. The stem-mothers have the power, unusual among animals as a  whole, but not very infrequent in the insects and their allies, of  reproducing their kind without having paired[6] with a male. Eggs  capable of parthenogenetic development, produced in large numbers in the  ovaries of these females, give rise to young which, developing within  the body of the mother, are born in an active state. Successive broods  of these wingless virgin females (fig. 6 _a_) appear through the spring  and summer months, and as the rate of their development is rapid, often  the whole life-story is completed within a week. The aphid population  increases very fast. Later a generation appears in which the thoracic  segments of the nymphs are seen to bear wing-rudiments like those of the  young cockroach, and a host of winged females (fig. 6_b_) are produced;  these have the power of migrating to other plants. We understand that  wings are not necessary to the earlier broods whose members have plenty  of room and food on their native shoots, but that when the population  becomes crowded, a winged brood capable of emigration is advantageous to  the race.    [6] Such virgin reproduction is termed 'parthenogenesis.'    Many generations of virgin female aphids, some wingless, others winged  when adult, succeed each other through the summer months. At the close  of the year the latest brood of these bring forth young, which develop  into males and egg-laying females; thus the yearly cycle is completed.  Variations in points of detail may be noticed in different species of  aphids. The autumn males and egg-laying females are, for example,  frequently winged, and the same species may have constantly recurring  generations of different forms adapted for different food-plants, or for  different regions of the same food-plant. But taking a general view of  the life-story of aphids for comparison with the life-story of other  insects, three points are especially noteworthy. Virgin reproduction  recurs regularly, parthenogenetic broods being succeeded by a single  sexual brood. A winged parent brings forth young which remain always  wingless, and wingless adults produce young which acquire wings. The  wings are developed, as in the cockroach, from outward and visible  wing-rudiments.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Apple Aphid (_Aphis pomi_), virgin females, _a_,  wingless; _b_, winged. Magnified 20 times.]    A family of Hemiptera, related to the Aphidae and equally obnoxious to  the gardener, is that of the Coccidae or scale-insects. These furnish an  excellent illustration of features noticeable in certain insect  life-histories. In the first place, the newly-hatched young differs  markedly from the parent in the details of its structure. A young coccid  (fig. 7 _c_) is flattened oval in shape, has well-developed feelers  (fig. 7 _d_) and legs, and runs actively about, usually on the leaves or  bark of trees and shrubs, through which it pierces with its long jaws,  so that it may suck sap from the soft tissues beneath. After a time it  fixes itself by means of these jaws and the characteristic scale or  protective covering, composed partly of a waxy secretion and partly of  dried excrement, begins to grow over its body. The female loses legs and  feelers, and never acquires wings, becoming little more than a sluggish  egg-bag (fig. 7 _e_). The male on the other hand passes into a second  larval stage in which there are no functional legs, but rudiments of  legs and of wings are present on the epidermis beneath the cuticle, as  shown by B.O. Schmidt for Aspidiotus (1885). The penultimate instar of  this sex in which the wing-rudiments are visible externally lies  passively beneath the scale, its behaviour resembling that of a  butterfly pupa. The adult winged male (fig. 7 _a_) leads a short, but  active life.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Mussel Scale-insect (_Mytilaspis pomorum_). _a_,  male; _b_, foot of male; _c_, larva, "]]]
