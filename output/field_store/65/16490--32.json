[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#3)"],[1,"st, these excesses  must be laid; but the spectacle disgusted him. The yells, screams, and  pikes with bloody heads upon them, formed a scene which he afterwards  described as \"hideous and revolting.\" At this time Napoleon was without  employment and very poor; and De Bourienne describes him as wandering  idly about Paris, living, chiefly at his (M. de B.'s) expense, at  restaurateurs' shops, and, among other wild-enough schemes, proposing  that he and his schoolfellow should take some houses on lease, and  endeavour to get a little money by subletting them in apartments. Such  were the views and occupations of Buonaparte--at the moment when the  national tragedy was darkening to its catastrophe. As yet he had been  but a spectator of the Revolution, destined to pave his own path to  sovereign power; it was not long before circumstances called on him to  play a part.    General Paoli, who had lived in England ever since the termination of  that civil war in which Charles Buonaparte served under his banner, was  cheered, when the great French Revolution first broke out, with the hope  that liberty was about to be restored to Corsica. He came to Paris, was  received with applause as a tried friend of freedom, and appointed  governor of his native island, which for some time he ruled wisely and  happily. But as the revolution advanced, Paoli, like most other wise  men, became satisfied that license was more likely to be established by  its leaders, than law and rational liberty; and avowing his aversion to  the growing principles of Jacobinism, and the scenes of tumult and  bloodshed to which they gave rise, he was denounced in the National  Assembly as the enemy of France. An expedition was sent to deprive him  of his government, under the command of La Combe, Michel, and Salicetti,  one of the Corsican deputies to the Convention; and Paoli called on his  countrymen to take arms in his and their own defence.    Buonaparte happened at that time (1793) to have leave of absence from  his regiment, and to be in Corsica on a visit to his mother. He had  fitted up a little reading-room at the top of the house as the quietest  part of it, and was spending his mornings in study, and his evenings  among his family and old acquaintance, when the arrival of the  expedition threw the island into convulsion. Paoli, who knew him well,  did all he could to enlist him in his cause; he used, among other  flatteries, to clap him on the back, and tell him he was \"one of  Plutarch's men.\" But Napoleon had satisfied himself that Corsica was too  small a country to maintain independence,--that she must fall under the  rule either of France or England; and that her interests would be best  served by adhering to the former. He therefore resisted all Paoli's  offers, and tendered his sword to the service of Salicetti. He was  appointed provisionally to the command of a battalion of National  Guards; and the first military service on which he was employed was the  reduction of a small fortress, called the Torre di Capitello, near  Ajaccio. He took it, but was soon besieged in it, and he and his  garrison, after a gallant defence, and living for some time on  horseflesh, were glad to evacuate the tower, and escape to the sea. The  English government now began to reinforce Paoli, and the cause of the  French party seemed for the moment to be desperate. The Buonapartes were  banished from Corsica, and their mother and sisters took refuge first at  Nice, and afterwards at Marseilles, where for some time they suffered  all the inconveniences of exile and poverty. Napoleon rejoined his  regiment. He had chosen France for his country; and seems, in truth, to  have preserved little or no affection for his native soil.    After arriving at supreme power, he bestowed one small fountain on  Ajaccio; and succeeded, by the death of a relation, to a petty olive  garden near that town. In the sequel of his history the name of Corsica  will scarcely recur.

Buonaparte's first military service occurred, as we have seen, in the  summer of 1793. The king of France had been put to death on the 21st of  January in that year; and in less than a month afterwards the convention  had declared war against England. The murder of the king, alike  imprudent as atrocious, had in fact united the princes of Europe against  the revolutionary cause; and within France itself a strong reaction took  place. The people of Toulon, the great port and arsenal of France on the  Mediterranean, partook these sentiments, and invited the English and  Spanish fleets off their coast to come to their assistance, and garrison  their city. The allied admirals took possession accordingly of Toulon,  and a motley force of English, Spaniards, and Neapolitans, prepared to  defend the place. In the harbour and roads there were twenty-five ships  of the line, and the city contained immense naval and military stores of  every description, so that the defection of Toulon was regarded as a  calamity of the first order by the revolutionary government.    This event occurred in the midst of that period which has received the  name of _the reign of terror_. The streets of Paris were streaming with  innocent blood; Robespierre was glutting himself with murder; fear and  rage were the passions that divided mankind, and their struggles  produced on either side the likeness of some epidemic frenzy. Whatever  else the government wanted, vigour to repel aggressions from without was  displayed in abundance. Two armies immediately marched upon Toulon; and  after a series of actions, in which the passes in the hills behind the  town were forced, the place was at last invested, and a memorable siege  commenced.    It was conducted with little skill, first by Cartaux, a vain coxcomb who  had been a painter, and then by Doppet, an ex-physician, and a coward.  To watch and report on the proceedings of these chiefs, there were  present in the camp several Representatives of the People, as they were  called--persons holding no military character or rank, but acting as  honourable spies for the government at Paris. The interference of these  personages on this, as on many other occasions, was productive of  delays, blunders, and misfortunes; but the terror which their ready  access to the despotic government inspired was often, on the other hand,  useful in stimulating the exertions of the military. The younger  Robespierre was one of the deputies at Toulon, and his name was enough  to make his presence formidable.    Cartaux had not yet been superseded, when Napoleon Buonaparte made his  appearance at headquarters, with a commission to assume the command of  the artillery. It has been said that he owed his appointment to the  private regard of Salicetti; but the high testimonials he had received  from the Military Academy were more likely to have served him; nor is it  possible to suppose that he had been so long in the regiment of La Fere  without being appreciated by some of his superiors. He had, besides,  shortly before this time, excited attention by a pamphlet, called the  _Supper of Beaucaire_, in which the politics of the Jacobin party were  spiritedly supported; and of which he was afterwards so ashamed, that he  took great pains to suppress it. However this may have been, he was  received almost with insolence by Cartaux, who, strutting about in an  uniform covered with gold lace, told him his assistance was not wanted,  but he was welcome to partake in _his_ glory.    The commandant of the artillery, on examining the state of affairs,  found much to complain of. They were still disputing which extremity of  the town should be the chief object of attack; though at the one there  were two strong and regular fortifications, and at the other only a  small and imperfect fort called Malbosquet. On inspecting their  batteries, he found that the guns were placed about two gunshots from  the walls; and that it was the custom to heat the shot at a distance  from the place where they were to be discharged; in other words, to heat  them to no purpose. Choosing officers of his own acquaintance to act  under him, and exerting himself to collect guns from all quarters,  Buonaparte soon remedied these disorders, and found himself master of an  efficient train of 200 pieces; and he then urged the general to adopt a  wholly new plan of operations in the future conduct of the siege.    The plan of Buonaparte appears _now_ the simplest and most obvious that  could have been suggested; yet it was not without great difficulty that  he could obtain the approbation of the doctor, who had by this time  superseded the painter. \"Your object,\" said he, \"is to make the English  evacuate Toulon. Instead of attacking them in the town, which must  involve a long series of operations, endeavour to establish batteries so  as to sweep the harbour and roadstead. If you can do this--the English  ships "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#3)"],[1,"every part of the city.    The hospital that we had to improvise at the fire-station was one of the  most interesting pieces of work we had to do in Brussels. There were 130  beds altogether in six large wards, and the Sisters had to sleep at  first in one, later in two large dormitories belonging to firemen absent  on active service. The firemen who were left did all the cooking  necessary for the nursing staff and patients, and were the most charming  of men, leaving nothing undone that could augment the Sisters' comfort.    It is a great strain on temper and endurance for women to work and sleep  and eat together in such close quarters, and on the whole they stood  the test well. In a very few days the fire-station was transformed into  a hospital, and one could tell the Sisters with truth that the wards  looked _almost_ like English ones. Alas and alas! At the end of the week  the Germans put in eighty soldiers with sore feet, who had over-marched,  and the glorious vision of nursing Tommy Atkins at the front faded into  the prosaic reality of putting hundreds of cold compresses on German  feet, that they might be ready all the sooner to go out and kill our  men. War is a queer thing!!           *       *       *       *       *    On the following Tuesday afternoon the Burgomaster of Charleroi came  into Brussels in an automobile asking for nurses and bringing with him a  permit for this purpose from the German authorities. Charleroi, which  was now also in German hands, was in a terrible state, and most of the  city burnt down to the ground. It was crammed with wounded--both French  and German--every warehouse and cottage almost were full of them, and  they were very short of trained people.    The Central Red Cross Bureau sent a message, asking if three of us  would go back with him. _Would we!_ Was it not the chance we had been  longing for. In ten minutes Sister Elsie, Sister Grace and I were in  that automobile speeding to Charleroi. I had packed quickly into a  portmanteau all I thought I was likely to want in the way of uniform and  other clothing, with a few medical comforts for the men, and a little  tea and cocoa for ourselves. The two Sisters had done likewise--so we  were rather horrified when we got to Hal, where we had to change  automobiles, the Burgomaster said he could not possibly take any of our  luggage, as we must get into quite a small car--the big one having to  return to Brussels. He assured us that our things would be sent on in a  few days--so back to Brussels went my portmanteau with all my clean  aprons and caps and everything else, and I did not see it again for  nearly a week. But such is war!    We waited nearly an hour at Hal while our German permits were examined,  and then went off in the small car. It was heart-breaking to see the  scenes of desolation as we passed along the road. Jumet--the  working-class suburb of Charleroi--was entirely burnt down, there did  not seem to be one house left intact. It is indeed terrible when  historic and consecrated buildings such as those at Louvain and Rheims  are burnt down, but in a way it is more pathetic to see these poor  little cottages destroyed, that must have meant so much to their owners,  and it makes one's heart ache to see among the crumbling ruins the  remains of a baby's perambulator, or the half-burnt wires of an old  four-post bed. Probably the inhabitants of Jumet had all fled, as there  was no one to be seen as we went through the deserted village, except  some German sentries pacing up and down.    Parts of Charleroi were still burning as we got to it, and a terrible  acrid smoke pervaded everything. Here the poorer streets were spared,  and it was chiefly the rich shops and banks and private houses that had  been destroyed. Charleroi was the great Birmingham of Belgium--coal-pits  all round, with many great iron and steel works, now of course all idle,  and most of the owners entirely ruined. The town was absolutely crammed  with German troops as we passed through; it had now been occupied for  two or three days and was being used as a great military depot.    But Charleroi was not to be our final destination--we went on a few more  kilometres along the Beaumont road, and drew up at a fairly large  building right out in the country. It was a hospital that had been three  parts built ten years ago, then abandoned for some reason and never  finished. Now it was being hastily fitted up as a Red Cross hospital,  and stretcher after stretcher of wounded--both French and German--were  being brought in as we arrived.    The confusion that reigned within was indescribable. There were some  girls there who had attended first-aid lectures, and they were doing  their best; but there were no trained nurses and no one particularly in  command. The German doctor had already gone, one of the Belgian doctors  was still working there, but he was absolutely worn out and went off  before long, as he had still cases to attend to in the town before he  went to his well-earned bed. He carried off the two Sisters with him,  till the morning, and I was left alone with two or three Red Cross  damsels to face the night. It is a dreadful nightmare to look back at.  Blood-stained uniforms hastily cut off the soldiers were lying on the  floor--half-open packets of dressings were on every locker; basins of  dirty water or disinfectant had not been emptied; men were moaning with  pain, calling for water, begging that their dressings might be done  again; and several new cases just brought in were requiring urgent  attention. And the cannon never ceased booming. I was not accustomed to  it then, and each crash meant to me rows of men mown down--maimed or  killed. I soon learnt that comparatively few shells do any damage,  otherwise there would soon be no men left at all. In time, too, one gets  so accustomed to cannon that one hardly hears it, but I had not arrived  at that stage then: this was my baptism of fire.    Among the other miseries of that night was the dreadful shortage of all  hospital supplies, and the scarcity of food for the men. There was a  little coffee which they would have liked, but there was no possibility  of hot water. The place had been hastily fitted up with electric light,  and the kitchen was arranged for steam cooking, so there was not even a  gas-jet to heat anything on. I had a spirit-lamp and methylated spirit  in my portmanteau, but, as I said, my luggage had been all wafted away  at Hal.    But the night wore away somehow, and with the morning light came plans  of organization and one saw how things could be improved in many ways,  and the patients made more comfortable. The hospital was a place of  great possibilities in some ways; its position standing almost at the  top of a high hill in its own large garden was ideal, and the air was  gloriously bracing, but little of it reached the poor patients as  unfortunately the Germans had issued a proclamation forbidding any  windows to be open, in case, it was said, anyone should fire from  them--and as we were all prisoners in their hands, we had to do as we  were bid.    At nine o'clock the Belgian doctor and the German commandant appeared,  and I went off with the former to help with an amputation of arm, in one  of the little temporary ambulances in the town of M----, three  kilometres away. The building had been a little dark shop and not very  convenient, and if the patient had not been so desperately ill, he  would have been moved to Charleroi for his operation. He was a French  tirailleur--a lad about twenty, his right arm had been severely injured  by shrapnel several days before, and was gangrenous right up to the  shoulder. He was unconscious and moaning slightly at intervals, but he  stood the operation very well, and we left him fairly comfortable when  we had to return to the hospital.    We got back about twelve, which is the hour usually dedicated to  patients' dinner, but it was impossible to find anything to eat except  potatoes. We sent everywhere to get some meat, but without success,  though in a day or two we got some kind of dark meat which I thought  must be horse. (Now from better acquaintance with ancient charger, I  know it to have been so.) There was just a little milk that was reserved  for the illest patients, no butter or bread. I was beginning to feel  rather in need of food myself by that time. There had been, of course,  up to then no time to bother about my own meals, and I had had nothing  since breakfast the day before, that is about thirty hours ago, except  a cup of coffee which I had begged from the concierge before starting  with the doctor for the amputation case.    Well, there was nothing to eat and only the dirtiest old woman in all  the world to cook it, but at three o'clock we managed to serve the  patients with an elegant dish of underdone lentils for the first course,  and overdone potatoes for the second, and partook ourselves gratefully  thereof, after they had finished. In the afternoon of that day a meeting  of the Red Cross Committee was held at the hospital, and I was sent for  and formally installed as Matron of the hospital with full authority to  make any improvements I thought necessary, and with the stipulation that  I might have two or three days' leave every few weeks, to go and visit  my scattered flock in Brussels. The appointment had to be made subject  to the approval of the German commandant, but apparently he made no  objection--at any rate I never heard of any.    And then began a very happy time for me, in spite of many difficulties  and disappointments. I can never tell the goodness of the Committee and  the Belgian doctor to me, and their kindness in letting me introduce all  our pernickety English ways to which they were not accustomed, won my  gratitude for ever. Never were Sisters so loyal and unselfish as mine.  The first part of the time they were overworked and underfed, and no"]]]
