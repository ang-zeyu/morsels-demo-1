If not for  it, the myriads of evil spirits had soon put an end to the  generations of men. But the goodness of God has ordained, that in  every Nisan, at the time of the spring equinox, the seraphim  shall approach the world of spirits, and intimidate them so that  they fear to do harm to men. Again, if God in His goodness had  not given protection to the weak, the tame animals would have  been extirpated long ago by the wild animals. In Tammuz, at the  time of the summer solstice, when the strength of behemot is at  its height, he roars so loud that all the animals hear it, and  for a whole year they are affrighted and timid, and their acts  become less ferocious than their nature is. Again, in Tishri, at  the time of the autumnal equinox, the great bird ziz[7] flaps his  wings and utters his cry, so that the birds of prey, the eagles  and the vultures, blench, and they fear to swoop down upon the  others and annihilate them in their greed. And, again, were it  not for the goodness of God, the vast number of big fish had  quickly put an end to the little ones. But at the time of the  winter solstice, in the month of Tebet, the sea grows restless,  for then leviathan spouts up water, and the big fish become  uneasy. They restrain their appetite, and the little ones escape  their rapacity.    Finally, the goodness of God manifests itself in the preservation  of His people Israel. It could not have survived the enmity of  the Gentiles, if God had not appointed protectors for it, the  archangels Michael and Gabriel.[8] Whenever Israel disobeys God,  and is accused of misdemeanors by the angels of the other  nations, he is defended by his designated guardians, with such  good result that the other angels conceive fear of them. Once the  angels of the other nations are terrified, the nations themselves  venture not to carry out their wicked designs against Israel.    That the goodness of God may rule on earth as in heaven, the  Angels of Destruction are assigned a place at the far end of the  heavens, from which they may never stir, while the Angels of  Mercy encircle the Throne of God, at His behest.[9]      THE ALPHABET    When God was about to create the world by His word, the  twenty-two letters of the alphabet[10] descended from the  terrible and august crown of God whereon they were engraved with  a pen of flaming fire. They stood round about God, and one after  the other spake and entreated, \"Create the world through me!\" The  first to step forward was the letter Taw. It said: \"O Lord of the  world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world through me, seeing  that it is through me that Thou wilt give the Torah to Israel by  the hand of Moses, as it is written, 'Moses commanded us the  Torah.'\" The Holy One, blessed be He, made reply, and said,  \"No!\" Taw asked, \"Why not?\" and God answered: \"Because in days to  come I shall place thee as a sign of death upon the foreheads of  men.\" As soon as Taw heard these words issue from the mouth of  the Holy One, blessed be He, it retired from His presence  disappointed.    The Shin then stepped forward, and pleaded: \"O Lord of the world,  create Thy world through me: seeing that Thine own name Shaddai  begins with me.\" Unfortunately, it is also the first letter of  Shaw, lie, and of Sheker, falsehood, and that incapacitated it.  Resh had no better luck. It was pointed out that it was the  initial letter of Ra', wicked, and Rasha' evil, and after that  the distinction it enjoys of being the first letter in the Name  of God, Rahum, the Merciful, counted for naught. The Kof was  rejected, because Kelalah, curse, outweighs the advantage of  being the first in Kadosh, the Holy One. In vain did Zadde call  attention to Zaddik, the Righteous One; there was Zarot, the  misfortunes of Israel, to testify against it. Pe had Podeh,  redeemer, to its credit, but Pesha: transgression, reflected  dishonor upon it. 'Ain was declared unfit, because, though it  begins 'Anawah, humility, it performs the same service for  'Erwah, immorality. Samek said: \"O Lord, may it be Thy will to  begin the creation with me, for Thou art called Samek, after me,  the Upholder of all that fall.\" But God said: \"Thou art needed in  the place in which thou art;[11] thou must continue to uphold all  that fall.\" Nun introduces Ner, \"the lamp of the Lord,\" which is  \"the spirit of men,\" but it also introduces Ner, \"the lamp of the  wicked,\" which will be put out by God. Mem starts Melek, king,  one of the titles of God. As it is the first letter of Mehumah,  confusion, as well, it had no chance of accomplishing its desire.  The claim of Lamed bore its refutation within itself. It advanced  the argument that it was the first letter of Luhot, the celestial  tables for the Ten Commandments; it forgot that the tables were  shivered in pieces by Moses. Kaf was sure of victory Kisseh, the  throne of God, Kabod, His honor, and Keter, His crown, all begin  with it. God had to remind it that He would smite together His  hands, Kaf, in despair over the misfortunes of Israel. Yod at  first sight seemed the appropriate letter for the beginning of  creation, on account of its association with Yah, God, if only  Yezer ha-Ra' the evil inclination, had not happened to begin with  it, too. Tet is identified with Tob, the good. However, the truly  good is not in this world; it belongs to the world to come. Het  is the first letter of Hanun, the Gracious One; but this  advantage is offset by its place in the word for sin, Hattat.  Zain suggests Zakor, remembrance, but it is itself the word for  weapon, the doer of mischief. Waw and He compose the Ineffable  Name of God; they are therefore too exalted to be pressed into  the service of the mundane world. If Dalet had stood only for  Dabar, the Divine Word, it would have been used, but it stands  also for Din, justice, and under the rule of law without love the  world would have fallen to ruin. Finally, in spite of reminding  one of Gadol, great, Gimel would not do, because Gemul,  retribution, starts with it.    After the claims of all these letters had been disposed of, Bet  stepped before the Holy One, blessed be He, and pleaded before  Him: \"O Lord of the world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world  through me, seeing that all the dwellers in the world give praise  daily unto Thee through me, as it is said, 'Blessed be the Lord  forever. Amen, and Amen.'\" The Holy One, blessed be He, at once  granted the petition of Bet. He said, \"Blessed be he that cometh  in the name of the Lord.\" And He created His world through Bet,  as it is said, \"Bereshit God created the heaven and the earth.\"  The only letter that had refrained from urging its claims was the  modest Alef, and God rewarded it later for its humility by giving  it the first place in the Decalogue.[12]      THE FIRST DAY    On the first day of creation God produced ten things:[13] the  heavens and the earth, Tohu and Bohu, light and darkness, wind  and water, the duration of the day[14] and the duration of the  night.[15]    Though the heavens and the earth consist of entirely different  elements,[16] they were yet created as a unit, \"like the pot and  its cover.\"[17] The heavens were fashioned from the light of  God's garment, and the earth from the snow under the Divine  Throne.[18] Tohu is a green band which encompasses the whole  world, and dispenses darkness, and Bohu consists of stones in the  abyss, the producers of the waters. The light created at the very  beginning is not the same as the light emitted by the sun, the  moon, and the stars, which appeared only on the fourth day. The  light of the first day was of a sort that would have enabled man  to see the world at a glance from one end to the other.  Anticipating the wickedness of the sinful generations of the  deluge and the Tower of Babel, who were unworthy to enjoy the  blessing of such light, God concealed it, but in the world to  come it will appear to the pious in all its pristine glory.[19]    Several heavens were created,[20] seven in fact,[21] each to  serve a purpose of its own. The first, the one visible to man,  has no function except that of covering up the light during the  night time; therefore it disappears every morning. The planets  are fastened to the second of the heavens; in the third the manna  is made for the pious in the hereafter; the fourth contains the  celestial Jerusalem together with the Temple, in which Michael  ministers as high priest, and offers the souls of the pious as  sacrifices. In the fifth heaven, the angel hosts reside, and sing  the praise of God, though only during the night, for by day it is  the task of Israel on earth to give glory to God on high. The  sixth heaven is an uncanny spot; there originate most of the  trials and visitations ordained for the earth and its  inhabitants. Snow lies heaped up there and hail; there are lofts  full of noxious dew, magazines stocked with storms, and cellars  holding reserves of smoke. Doors of fire separate these celestial  chambers, which are under the supervision of the archangel  Metatron. Their pernicious contents defiled the heavens until  David's time. The pious king prayed God to purge His exalted  dwelling of whatever was pregnant with evil; it was not becoming  that such things should exist near the Merciful One. Only then  they were removed to the earth.    The seventh heaven, on the other hand, contains naught but what  is good and beautiful: right, justice, and mercy, the storehouses  of life, peace, and blessing, the souls of the pious, the souls  and spirits of unborn generations, the dew with which God will  revive the dead on the resurrection day, and, above all, the  Divine Throne, surrounded by the seraphim, the ofanim, the holy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"in order that Joseph's rescue might be  accomplished, and the pits remained dry until Joseph was  safe in the hands of the Ishmaelites.[34]    Reuben had several reasons for interceding in behalf of  Joseph. He knew that he as the oldest of the brethren would  be held responsible by their father, if any evil befell him.  Besides, Reuben was grateful to Joseph for having reckoned  him among the eleven sons of Jacob in narrating his  dream of the sun, moon, and stars. Since his disrespectful  bearing toward Jacob, he had not thought himself worthy  of being considered one of his sons.[35] First Reuben tried  to restrain his brethren from their purpose, and he addressed  them in words full of love and compassion. But when he  saw that neither words nor entreaties would change their  intention, he begged them, saying: \"My brethren, at least  hearken unto me in respect of this, that ye be not so wicked  and cruel as to slay him. Lay no hand upon your brother,  shed no blood, cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness,  and let him perish thus.[36]    Then Reuben went away from his brethren, and he hid  in the mountains, so that he might be able to hasten back  in a favorable moment and draw Joseph forth from the pit  and restore him to his father. He hoped his reward would  be pardon for the transgression he had committed against  Jacob.[37] His good intention was frustrated, yet Reuben was  rewarded by God, for God gives a recompense not only for  good deeds, but for good intentions as well.[38] As he was  the first of the brethren of Joseph to make an attempt to  save him, so the city of Bezer in the tribe of Reuben was  the first of the cities of refuge appointed to safeguard the  life of the innocent that seek help.[39] Furthermore God  spake to Reuben, saying: \"As thou wast the first to endeavor  to restore a child unto his father, so Hosea, one of  thy descendants, shall be the first to endeavor to lead Israel  back to his heavenly Father.\"[40]    The brethren accepted Reuben's proposition, and Simon  seized Joseph, and cast him into a pit swarming with snakes  and scorpions, beside which was another unused pit, filled  with offal.[41] As though this were not enough torture, Simon  bade his brethren fling great stones at Joseph. In his later  dealings with this brother Simon, Joseph showed all the  forgiving charitableness of his nature. When Simon was  held in durance in Egypt as a hostage, Joseph, so far from  bearing him a grudge, ordered crammed poultry to be set  before him at all his meals.[42]    Not satisfied with exposing Joseph to the snakes and  scorpions, his brethren had stripped him bare before they  flung him into the pit. They took off his coat of many  colors, his upper garment, his breeches, and his shirt.[43]  However, the reptiles could do him no harm. God heard  his cry of distress, and kept them in hiding in the clefts  and the holes, and they could not come near him. From the  depths of the pit Joseph appealed to his brethren, saying:  \"O my brethren, what have I done unto you, and what is  my transgression? Why are you not afraid before God on  account of your treatment of me? Am I not flesh of your  flesh, and bone of your bone? Jacob your father, is he not  also my father? Why do you act thus toward me? And  how will you be able to lift up your countenance before  Jacob? O Judah, Reuben, Simon, Levi, my brethren, deliver  me, I pray you, from the dark place into which you  have cast me. Though I committed a trespass against you,  yet are ye children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were  compassionate with the orphan, gave food to the hungry,  and clothed the naked. How, then, can ye withhold your  pity from your own brother, your own flesh and bone? And  though I sinned against you, yet you will hearken unto my  petition for the sake of my father. O that my father knew  what my brethren are doing unto me, and what they spake  unto me!\"    To avoid hearing Joseph's weeping and cries of distress,  his brethren passed on from the pit, and stood at a bow-  shot's distance.[44] The only one among them that manifested  pity was Zebulon. For two days and two nights no food  passed his lips on account of his grief over the fate of  Joseph, who had to spend three days and three nights in the  pit before he was sold. During this period Zebulon was  charged by his brethren to keep watch at the pit. He was  chosen to stand guard because he took no part in the meals.  Part of the time Judah also refrained from eating with  the rest, and took turns at watching, because he feared  Simon and Gad might jump down into the pit and put an  end to Joseph's life.[45]    While Joseph was languishing thus, his brethren determined  to kill him. They would finish their meal first, they  said, and then they would fetch him forth and slay him.  When they had done eating, they attempted to say grace, but  Judah remonstrated with them: \"We are about to take the  life of a human being, and yet would bless God? That is  not a blessing, that is contemning the Lord.[46] What profit  is it if we slay our brother? Rather will the punishment of  God descend upon us. I have good counsel to give you.  Yonder passeth by a travelling company of Ishmaelites on  their way to Egypt. Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,  and let not our hand be upon him. The Ishmaelites  will take him with them upon their journeyings, and he  will be lost among the peoples of the earth.[47] Let us follow  the custom of former days, for Canaan, too, the son of Ham,  was made a slave for his evil deeds, and so will we do with  our brother Joseph.\"[48]      THE SALE    While the brethren of Joseph were deliberating upon his  fate, seven Midianitish merchantmen passed near the pit  in which he lay. They noticed that many birds were circling  above it, whence they assumed that there must be water  therein, and, being thirsty, they made a halt in order to refresh  themselves. When they came close, they heard Joseph  screaming and wailing, and they looked down into the pit  and saw a youth of beautiful figure and comely appearance.  They called to him, saying: \"Who art thou? Who brought  thee hither, and who cast thee into this pit in the wilderness?\"  They all joined together and dragged him up, and  took him along with them when they continued on their  journey. They had to pass his brethren, who called out to  the Midianites: \"Why have you done such a thing, to steal  our slave and carry him away with you? We threw the  lad into the pit, because he was disobedient. Now, then, return  our slave to us.\" The Midianites replied: \"What,  this lad, you say, is your slave, your servant? More likely  is it that you all are slaves unto him, for in beauty of form,  in pleasant looks, and fair appearance, he excelleth you all.  Why, then, will you speak lies unto us? We will not give  ear unto your words, nor believe you, for we found the lad  in the wilderness, in a pit, and we took him out, and we will  carry him away with us on our journey.\" But the sons of  Jacob insisted, \"Restore our slave to us, lest you meet death  at the edge of the sword.\"    Unaffrighted, the Midianites drew their weapons, and,  amid war whoops, they prepared to enter into a combat with  the sons of Jacob. Then Simon rose up, and with bared  sword he sprang upon the Midianites, at the same time  uttering a cry that made the earth reverberate. The Midianites  fell down in great consternation, and he said: \"I am  Simon, the son of the Hebrew Jacob, who destroyed the city  of Shechem alone and unaided, and together with my brethren  I destroyed the cities of the Amorites. God do so and  more also, if it be not true that all the Midianites, your  brethren, united with all the Canaanite kings to fight with  me, cannot hold out against me. Now restore the boy you  took from us, else will I give your flesh unto the fowls of  the air and to the beasts of the field.\"    The Midianites were greatly afraid of Simon, and, terrified  and abashed, they spake to the sons of Jacob with little  courage: \"Said ye not that ye cast this lad into the pit because  he was of a rebellious spirit? What, now, will ye do  with an insubordinate slave? Rather sell him to us, we are  ready to pay any price you desire.\" This speech was part  of the purpose of God. He had put it into the heart of  the Midianites to insist upon possessing Joseph, that he  might not remain with his brethren, and be slain by them.[49]  The brethren assented, and Joseph was sold as a slave while  they sat over their meal. God spake, saying: \"Over a meal  did ye sell your brother, and thus shall Ahasuerus sell your  descendants to Haman over a meal, and because ye have  sold Joseph to be a slave, therefore shall ye say year after  year, Slaves were we unto Pharaoh in Egypt.\"[50]    The price paid for Joseph by the Midianites was twenty  pieces of silver, enough for a pair of shoes for each of his  brethren. Thus \"they sold the righteous for silver, and the  needy for a pair of shoes.\" For so handsome a youth as  Joseph the sum paid was too low by far, but his appearance  had been greatly changed by the horrible anguish he bad  endured in the pit with the snakes and the scorpions. He  had lost his ruddy complexion, and he looked sallow and  sickly, and the Midianites were justified in paying a small  sum for him.[51]    The merchantmen had come upon Joseph naked in the  pit, for his brethren had stripped him of all his clothes.  That he might not appear before men in an unseemly condition,  God sent Gabriel down to him, and the angel enlarged  the amulet banging from Joseph's neck until it was  a garment that covered him entirely. Joseph's brethren  were looking after him as he departed with the Midianites,  and when they saw him with clothes upon him, they cried  after them, \"Give us his raiment! We sold him naked,  without clothes.\" His owners refused to yield to their demand,  but they agreed to reimburse the"]]]
