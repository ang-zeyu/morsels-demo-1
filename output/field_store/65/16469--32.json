The heavens having been put in order,* he set about peopling the earth,  and the gods, who had so far passively and perhaps powerlessly watched  him at his work, at length made up their minds to assist him. They  covered the soil with verdure, and all collectively \"made living beings  of many kinds. The cattle of the fields, the wild beasts of the fields,  the reptiles of the fields, they fashioned them and made of them  creatures of life.\"** According to one legend, these first animals  had hardly left the hands of their creators, when, not being able to  withstand the glare of the light, they fell dead one after the other.  Then Merodach, seeing that the earth was again becoming desolate, and  that its fertility was of no use to any one, begged his father Ea to cut  off his head and mix clay with the blood which welled from the trunk,  then from this clay to fashion new beasts and men, to whom the virtues  of this divine blood would give the necessary strength to enable them  to resist the air and light. At first they led a somewhat wretched  existence, and \"lived without rule after the manner of beasts. But,  in the first year, appeared a monster endowed with human reason named  Oannes, who rose from out of the Erythraean sea, at the point where it  borders Babylonia. He had the whole body of a fish, but above his fish's  head he had another head which was that of a man, and human feet emerged  from beneath his fish's tail; he had a human voice, and his image is  preserved to this day. He passed the day in the midst of men without  taking any food; he taught them the use of letters, sciences and arts of  all kinds, the rules for the founding of cities, and the construction of  temples, the principles of law and of surveying; he showed them how to  sow and reap; he gave them all that contributes to the comforts of life.  Since that time nothing excellent has been invented. At sunset this  monster Oannes plunged back into the sea, and remained all night beneath  the waves, for he was amphibious. He wrote a book on the origin of  things and of civilization, which he gave to men.\" These are a few of  the fables which were current among the races of the Lower Euphrates  with regard to the first beginnings of the universe. That they possessed  many other legends of which we now know nothing is certain, but either  they have perished for ever, or the works in which they were recorded  still await discovery, it may be under the ruins of a palace or in the  cupboards of some museum.    * The arrangement of the heavens by Merodach is described at the end  of the fourth and beginning of the fifth tablets. The text, originally  somewhat obscure, is so mutilated in places that it is not always  possible to make out the sense with certainty.    ** The creation of the animals and then of man is related on the seventh  tablet, and on a tablet the place of which, in the series, is still  undetermined. I have been obliged to translate the text rather freely,  so as to make the meaning clear to the modern reader.    [Illustration: 017.jpg A GOD-FISH]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian bas-relief from       Nimrud.    They do not seem to have conceived the possibility of an absolute  creation, by means of which the gods, or one of them, should have  evolved out of nothing all that exists: the creation was for them merely  the setting in motion of pre-existing elements, and the creator only an  organizer of the various materials floating in chaos. Popular fancy  in different towns varied the names of the creators and the methods  employed by them; as centuries passed on, a pile of vague, confused, and  contradictory traditions were amassed, no one of which was held to be  quite satisfactory, though all found partisans to support them. Just as  in Egypt, the theologians of local priesthoods endeavoured to classify  them and bring them into a kind of harmony: many they rejected and  others they recast in order to better reconcile their statements: they  arranged them in systems, from which they undertook to unravel, under  inspiration from on high, the true history of the universe. That which I  have tried to set forth above is very ancient, if, as is said to be the  case, it was in existence two or even three thousand years before our  era; but the versions of it which we possess were drawn up much later,  perhaps not till about the VIIth century B.C.* It had been accepted by  the inhabitants of Babylon because it flattered their religious vanity  by attributing the credit of having evolved order out of chaos to  Merodach, the protector of their city.** He it was whom the Assyrian  scribes had raised to a position of honour at the court of the last  kings of Nineveh:*** it was Merodach's name which Berossus inscribed at  the beginning of his book, when he set about relating to the Greeks  the origin of the world according to the Chaldeans, and the dawn of  Babylonian civilization.         * The question as to whether the text was originally written       in Sumerian or in the Semitic tongue has frequently been       discussed; the form in which we have it at present is not       very old, and does not date much further back than the reign       of Assurbanipal, if it is not even contemporary with that       monarch. According to Sayce, the first version would date       back beyond the XXth century, to the reign of Khammurabi;       according to Jensen, beyond the XXXth century before our       era.         ** Sayce thinks that the myth originated at Eridu, on the       shores of the Persian Gulf, and afterwards received its       present form at Babylon, where the local schools of theology       adapted it to the god Merodach.         *** The tablets in which it is preserved for us come partly       from the library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh, partly from       that of the temple of Nebo at Borsippa; these latter are       more recent than the others, and seem to have been written       during the period of the Persian supremacy.    Like the Egyptian civilization, it had had its birth between the sea and  the dry land on a low, marshy, alluvial soil, flooded annually by the  rivers which traverse it, devastated at long intervals by tidal waves of  extraordinary violence. The Euphrates and the Tigris cannot be regarded  as mysterious streams like the Nile, whose source so long defied  exploration that people were tempted to place it beyond the regions  inhabited by man. The former rise in Armenia, on the slopes of the  Niphates, one of the chains of mountains which lie between the Black Sea  and Mesopotamia, and the only range which at certain points reaches the  line of eternal snow. At first they flow parallel to one another, the  Euphrates from east to west as far as Malatiyeh, the Tigris from the  west towards the east in the direction of Assyria. Beyond Malatiyeh, the  Euphrates bends abruptly to the south-west, and makes its way across the  Taurus as though desirous of reaching the Mediterranean by the shortest  route, but it soon alters its intention, and makes for the south-east  in search of the Persian Gulf. The Tigris runs in an oblique direction  towards the south from the point where the mountains open out, and  gradually approaches the Euphrates. Near Bagdad the two rivers are only  a few leagues apart. However, they do not yet blend their waters; after  proceeding side by side for some twenty or thirty miles, they again  separate and only finally; unite at a point some eighty leagues lower  down. At the beginning of our geological period their course was not  such a long one. The sea then penetrated as far as lat. 33 deg., and was  only arrested by the last undulations of the great plateau of secondary  formation, which descend from the mountain group of Armenia: the two  rivers entered the sea at a distance of about twenty leagues apart,  falling into a gulf bounded on the east by the last spurs of the  mountains of Iran, on the west by the sandy heights which border the  margin of the Arabian Desert.* They filled up this gulf with their  alluvial deposit, aided by the Adhem, the Diyaleh, the Kerkha, the  Karun, and other rivers, which at the end of long independent courses  became tributaries of the Tigris. The present beds of the two rivers,  connected by numerous canals, at length meet near the village of Kornah  and form one single river, the Shatt-el-Arab, which carries their waters  to the sea. The mud with which they are charged is deposited when it  reaches their mouth, and accumulates rapidly; it is said that the coast  advances about a mile every seventy years.** In its upper reaches the  Euphrates collects a number of small affluents, the most important of  which, the Kara-Su, has often been confounded with it. Near the middle  of its course, the Sadjur on the right bank carries into it the waters  of the Taurus and the Amanus, on the left bank the Balikh and the Khabur  contribute those of the Karadja-Dagh; from the mouth of the Khabur to  the sea the Euphrates receives no further affluent. The Tigris is fed on  the left by the Bitlis-Khai, the two Zabs, the Adhem, and the Diyaleh.  The Euphrates is navigable from Sumeisat, the Tigris from Mossul, both  of them almost as soon as they leave the mountains. They are subject  to annual floods, which occur when the winter snow melts on the higher  ranges of Armenia. The Tigris, which rises from the southern slope of  the Niphates and has the more direct course, is the first to overflow  its banks, which it does at the beginning of March, and reaches its  greatest height about the 10th or 12th of May. The Euphrates rises in  the middle of March, and does not attain its highest level till the  close of May. From June onwards it falls with increasing rapidity; by  September all the water which has not been absorbed by the soil has  returned to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"left banks,  as if to escape from its bed, but the rocky escarpments which hem it in  present an insurmountable barrier to it; from rapid to rapid it descends  with such capricious windings that it covers a course of more than 62  miles before reaching, the Dead Sea, nearly 1300 feet below the level of  the Mediterranean.*         * The exact figures are: the Lake of Huleh 7 feet above the       Mediterranean; the Lake of Genesareth 68245 feet, and the       Dead Sea 1292 feet below the sea-level; to the south of       the Dead Sea, towards the water-parting of the Akabah, the       ground is over 720 feet higher than the level of the Red       Sea.

Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than the country on either  bank. On the east, the ground rises abruptly to a height of about 3000  feet, resembling a natural rampart flanked with towers and bastions:  behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating and  intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the  Dead Sea--the Yarmuk,* the Jabbok,** and the Arnon.***         * The Yarmuk does not occur in the Bible, but we meet with       its name in the Talmud, and the Greeks adopted it under the       form Hieromax.         ** _Gen._ xxxii. 22; Numb, xxi. 24.

[Shephelah = \"low country,\" plain (Josh. xi. 16).       With the article it means the plain along the Mediterranean       from Joppa to Gaza.--Te.]    The whole of this district forms a little world in itself, whose  inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits, live a life of isolation,  with no ambition to take part in general history. West of the Jordan, a  confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered slopes  affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and  olives. One ridge--Mount Carmel--detached from the principal chain  near the southern end of the Lake of Genesareth, runs obliquely to  the north-west, and finally projects into the sea. North of this range  extends Galilee, abounding in refreshing streams and fertile fields;  while to the south, the country falls naturally into three parallel  zones--the littoral, composed alternately of dunes and marshes--an  expanse of plain, a \"Shephelah,\" dotted about with woods and watered by  intermittent rivers,--and finally the mountains. The region of dunes  is not necessarily barren, and the towns situated in it--Gaza, Jaffa,  Ashdod, and Ascalon--are surrounded by flourishing orchards and gardens.  The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground needing no  manure and very little labour. The higher ground and the hill-tops are  sometimes covered with verdure, but as they advance southwards, they  become denuded and burnt by the sun. The valleys, too, are watered only  by springs, which are dried up for the most part during the summer, and  the soil, parched by the continuous heat, can scarcely be distinguished  from the desert. In fact, till the Sinaitic Peninsula and the frontiers  of Egypt are reached, the eye merely encounters desolate and almost  uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter torrents, and overshadowed  by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The spring rains, however,  cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which for a few weeks  furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.    We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that  Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal  area, isolated by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is  admirably suited to become the seat of a separate independent state.  In the north, we have the country of the two rivers--the  Naharaim--extending from the Orontes to the Euphrates and the Balikh, or  even as far as the Khabur:* in the centre, between the two ranges of  the Lebanon, lie Coele-Syria and its two unequal neighbours, Aram of  Damascus and Phoenicia; while to the south is the varied collection of  provinces bordering the valley of the Jordan.         * The Naharaim of the Egyptians was first identified with       Mesopotamia; it was located between the Orontes and the       Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero. This opinion is now       adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight       differences in detail. Ed. Meyer has accurately compared the       Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration       of the Seleucidae.    It is impossible at the present day to assert, with any approach to  accuracy, what peoples inhabited these different regions towards the  fourth millennium before our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics  are brought to light of a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we  find stone weapons and implements, besides pottery, often elegant in  contour, but for the most part coarse in texture and execution. These  remains, however, are not accompanied by any monument of definite  characteristics, and they yield no information with regard to the  origin or affinities of the tribes who fashioned them.* The study of the  geographical nomenclature in use about the XVIth century B.C. reveals  the existence, at all events at that period, of several peoples and  several languages. The mountains, rivers, towns, and fortresses in  Palestine and Coele-Syria are designated by words of Semitic origin: it  is easy to detect, even in the hieroglyphic disguise which they bear  on the Egyptian geographical lists, names familiar to us in Hebrew or  Assyrian.         * Researches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of       Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to       any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias,       near Tripoli, and by Botta at Nahr el-Kelb, and at Adlun by       the Duc de Luynes, have been successively explored by       Lartet, Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson. The grottoes of       Palestine proper, at Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at       Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since       their discovery. The Abbe Richard desired to identify the       flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by       Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the       passage of the Jordan (_Josh._ v- 2-9), some of which might       have been buried in that hero's tomb.    But once across the Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal  no affinities to these languages, but are apparently connected with one  or other of the dialects of Asia Minor.* The tenacity with which the  place-names, once given, cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a  certain number at least of those we know in Syria were in use there long  before they were noted down by the Egyptians, and that they must have  been heirlooms from very early peoples. As they take a Semitic or  non-Semitic form according to their geographical position, we may  conclude that the centre and south were colonized by Semites, and the  north by the immigrant tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not  wanting to support this conclusion, and they prove that it is not so  entirely arbitrary as we might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic  visitors who, under a king of the XIIth dynasty, came to offer gifts to  Khnumhotpu, the Lord of Beni-Hasan, are completely Semitic in type,  and closely resemble the Bedouins of the present day. Their  chief--Abisha--bears a Semitic name,** as too does the Sheikh Ammianshi,  with whom Sinuhit took refuge.***         * The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns       in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is       admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the       question.         ** His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew       Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24; xxi. 17) and       with the Chaldaeo-Assyrian Abeshukh.         *** The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana,       Ammiza-dugga, and perhaps Ammurabi, or Khammurabi, of one of       the Babylonian dynasties; it contains, with the element       Ammi, a final _anshi_. Chabas connects it with two Hebrew       words _Am-nesh_, which he does not translate.    Ammianshi himself reigned over the province of Kadima, a word which in  Semitic denotes the East. Finally, the only one of their gods known to  us, Hadad, was a Semite deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and  whom we find later on ruling over the destinies of Damascus. Peoples  of Semitic speech and religion must, indeed, have already occupied the  greater part of that region on the shores of the Mediterranean which we  find still in their possession many centuries later, at the time of the  Egyptian conquest.

When,  however, the \"lords of the sands\" grew too insolent, the Pharaoh sent a  column of light troops against them, and inflicted on them such a severe  punishment, that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for  years. Offenders banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent  kinglets, who were in a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and  the Dead Sea. Egyptian sailors used to set out to traffic along the  seaboard, taking to piracy when hard pressed; Egyptian merchants were  accustomed to penetrate by easy stages into the interior. The accounts  they gave of their journeys were not reassuring. The traveller had first  to face the solitudes which confronted him before reaching the Isthmus,  and then to avoid as best he might the attacks of the pillaging tribes  "]]]
