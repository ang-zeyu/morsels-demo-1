But no; at  that instant he turned from it to him, and Max was half frightened at the  sternness of his look.    \"My son,\" he said, \"I am astonished and deeply grieved that you could read  and enjoy anything like this, for it is full of profanity; and reading or  hearing such expressions is very likely to lead to the use of them. Max,  do you ever say such words?\"    Max trembled and grew red and pale by turns, but did not speak.    \"Answer me,\" was his father's stern command.    \"Not often, papa.\"    The captain barely caught the low breathed words. \"Not often? sometimes,  then?\" he groaned, covering his face with his hand.    \"O papa, don't be so grieved! I'll never do it again,\" Max said in a  broken voice.    The captain sighed deeply. \"Max,\" he said, \"dearly as I love my only son,  I would sooner lay him under the sod, knowing that his soul was in heaven,  than have him live to be a profane swearer. Bring me that Bible from the  table yonder.\"    The boy obeyed.    \"Now turn to the twenty-fourth chapter of Leviticus, and read the  sixteenth verse.\"    Max read in a trembling voice, \"'And he that blasphemeth the name of the  Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall  certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land,  when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.'\"    \"Now the twenty-third,\" said his father.    \"'And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth  him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the  children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.'\"    Max had some difficulty in finishing the verse, and at the end quite broke  down.    \"Papa,\" he sobbed, \"I didn't know that was in the Bible. I never thought  about its being so dreadfully wicked to say bad words.\"    \"What do you now think a boy deserves who has done it again and again? say  as often as Max Raymond has?\" asked his father.    \"I suppose to be stoned to death like that man. But nobody is ever put to  death for swearing nowadays?\" the boy said, half inquiringly, not daring  to look at his father as he spoke.    \"No, Max, fortunately for you and many others. But suppose you were my  father and I a boy of your age, and that I had been swearing, what would  you think you ought to do about it?\"    \"Give you a sound flogging,\" he answered, in a low, reluctant tone.    \"Well, Max, that is just what I shall have to do, if I ever know you to  use a profane word again,\" said his father, in a grave, sad tone. \"I  should do it now, but for the hope that you are sorry enough for the past  to carefully avoid that sin in the future.\"    \"Indeed I will, papa,\" he said, very humbly.    \"And, Max,\" resumed his father, \"you are never to make a companion of, or  go at all with anybody who uses such language, and never to read a book or  story that has in it anything of that kind. And you are not to say by  George or by anything. Our Saviour says, 'Let your communication be Yea,  yea, Nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.' My son,  have you asked God to forgive you for taking His holy name in vain?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then go at once to your room and do it.\"    \"I did, papa,\" Max said, when he came down again to find his father  waiting for him.    \"I trust the petition came from your heart, my son,\" was the grave but  kind rejoinder. \"I must have a little more talk with you on this subject,  but not now, for it is time we followed the others into the next house, if  we would not keep Grandma Rose's tea waiting.\"          CHAPTER III.        \"A kingdom is a nest of families, and a family is a small      kingdom.\"--Tupper.      It was a bright and cheerful scene that greeted the eyes of Captain  Raymond and his son as they entered the parlor of the adjacent cottage.    It was strictly a family gathering, yet the room was quite full. Mr.  Dinsmore was there with his wife, his daughter Elsie and her children,  Edward and Zoe, Elsie Leland with her husband and babe, Violet Raymond  with her husband's two little girls, Lulu and Grace, and lastly Rosie and  Walter.    Everybody had a kindly greeting for the captain, and Violet's bright face  grew still brighter as she made room for him on the sofa by her side.    \"We were beginning to wonder what was keeping you,\" she said.    \"Yes, I'm afraid I am rather behind time,\" he returned. \"I hope you have  not delayed your tea for me, Mrs. Dinsmore.\"    \"No; it is but just ready,\" she said. \"Ah, there's the bell. Please, all  of you walk out.\"    When the meal was over all returned to the parlor, where they spent the  next hour in desultory chat.    Gracie claimed a seat on her father's knee. Lulu took possession of an  ottoman and pushed it up as close to his side as she could; then seating  herself on it leaned up against him.    He smiled and stroked her hair, then glanced about the room in search of  Max.    The boy was sitting silently in a corner, but reading an invitation in his  father's eyes, he rose and came to his other side.    The ladies were talking of the purchases they wished to make in Boston,  New York or Philadelphia, on their homeward route.    \"I must get winter hats for Lulu and Gracie,\" said Violet.    \"I want a bird on mine, Mamma Vi,\" said Lulu; \"a pretty one with gay  feathers.\"    \"Do you know, Lulu, that they skin the poor little birds alive in order to  preserve the brilliancy of their plumage?\" Violet said with a troubled  look. \"I will not wear them on that account, and as you are a kind-hearted  little girl, I think you will not wish to do so either.\"    \"But I do,\" persisted Lulu. \"Of course I wouldn't have a bird killed on  purpose, but after they are killed I might just as well have one.\"    \"But do you not see,\" said Grandma Elsie, \"that if every one would refuse  to buy them, the cruel business of killing them would soon cease? and that  it will go on as long as people continue to buy and wear them?\"    \"I don't care, I want one,\" pouted Lulu. \"Papa, can't I have it?\"    \"No, you cannot,\" he said with grave displeasure. \"I am sorry to see that  you can be so heartless. You can have just whatever Grandma Elsie and  Mamma Vi think best for you, and with that you must be content.\"    Lulu was silenced, but for the rest of the evening her face wore an ugly  scowl.    \"My little girl is growing sleepy,\" the captain said presently to Gracie.  \"Papa will carry you over home and put you to bed. Lulu, you may come  too.\"    \"I don't want to, papa, I----\" she began; but he silenced her with a look.    \"Bid good-night to our friends and come,\" he said. \"You also, Max.\"    Max, though surprised at the order, obeyed with cheerful alacrity in  strong contrast to Lulu's sullen and reluctant compliance, which said as  plainly as words that she would rebel if she dared.    \"I don't see why papa makes us come away so soon,\" she grumbled to her  brother in an undertone, as they passed from one cottage to the other,  their father a little in advance.    \"He must have some good reason,\" said Max, \"and I for one am willing  enough to obey him, seeing it's such a little while I'll have the chance.\"    They had now reached the veranda of their own cottage.    \"Come in quickly out of this cold wind, children,\" their father said; then  as he closed the outer door after them, \"Run into the parlor and get  thoroughly warm before going up to your rooms.\"    He sat down by the stove with Grace on his knee, and bade the other two  draw up close to it and him, one on each side. And when they had done so,  \"My three dear children,\" he said in tender tones, glancing from one to  another, \"no words can tell how much I love you. Will you all think very  often of papa and follow him with your prayers when he is far away on the  sea?\"    \"Oh, yes, yes, papa!\" they all said with tears in their eyes, while Gracie  put her small arms round his neck. Lulu rested her head on his shoulder,  and Max took a hand and pressed it in both of his.    \"Papa, you will think of us, too?\" he said inquiringly.    \"Yes, indeed, my darlings; you will never be long out of my mind, and  nothing will make me happier than to hear that you are well and doing your  duty faithfully.\"    \"I shall try very hard, papa,\" Max said, with affectionate look and tone,  \"if it is only to please you and make your heart glad.\"    \"Thank you, my son,\" his father replied, \"but I hope a still stronger  motive will be that you may please God and honor Him. Never forget, my  children, that though your earthly father may be far away and know nothing  of your conduct, God's all-seeing eye is ever upon you.\"    A half hour had passed very quickly and delightfully to the children, when  at length, seeing Gracie's eyelids begin to droop, their father said it  was time for him to carry her up to bed.    \"Shall we stay here till you come down again, papa?\" asked Max.    \"No; you and Lulu may go to bed now.\"    \"Then good-night, papa.\"    \"No, you need not bid me good-night yet,\" the captain said. \"I shall see  you both in your rooms before you are asleep.\"    \"Well, Lu, are you sorry now that papa made you come home so soon?\" asked  Max, as they went up-stairs together.    \"No, indeed! Haven't we had a nice time, Max? Oh, if only we could keep  papa all the time!\"    \"I wish we could,\" said Max. \"But we won't have so hard a time as we've  had for the last two years whenever he was away.\"    They had reached the door of Lulu's room. \"Max,\" she said, turning to him  as with a sudden thought, \"what do you suppose papa is coming to our rooms  for?\"    \"What do _you_ suppose? have you done anything you ought to be punished  for?\" asked Max, a little mischievously. \"I thought you looked very cross  and rebellious about the hat and about having to come home so soon. I'm  very sure, from what I've heard of Grandpa Dinsmore's strictness, that if  you were his child you'd"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#3)"],[1,"it will vanish from your eyes.\"    Then the wise woman went away. \"Now,\" thought little Two Eyes, \"I will  try if what she says is true, for I am very hungry,\" so she said:      \"Little goat, if you're able,    Pray deck out my table.\"    The words were scarcely spoken, when a beautiful little table stood  really before her; it had a white cloth and plates, and knives and  forks, and silver spoons, and such a delicious dinner, smoking hot as if  it had just come from the kitchen. Then little Two Eyes sat down and  said the shortest grace she knew--\"Pray God be our guest for all time.  Amen\"--before she allowed herself to taste anything. But oh, how she did  enjoy her dinner! and when she had finished, she said, as the wise woman  had taught her:      \"Little goat, when you're able,    Remove my nice table.\"    In a moment, the table and everything upon it had disappeared. \"That is  a pleasant way to keep house,\" said little Two Eyes, and felt quite  contented and happy. In the evening, when she went home with the goat,  she found an earthenware dish with some scraps which her sisters had  left for her, but she did not touch them. The next morning she went away  with the goat, leaving them behind where they had been placed for her.  The first and second times that she did so, the sisters did not notice  it; but when they found it happened every day, they said one to the  other, \"There is something strange about little Two Eyes, she leaves her  supper every day, and all that has been put for her has been wasted; she  must get food somewhere else.\"    So they determined to find out the truth, and they arranged that when  Two Eyes took her goat to the field, One Eye should go with her to take  particular notice of what she did, and discover if anything was brought  for her to eat and drink.    So when Two Eyes started with her goat, One Eye said to her, \"I am going  with you to-day to see if the goat gets her food properly while you are  watching the rest.\"    But Two Eyes knew what she had in her mind. So she drove the goat into  the long grass, and said, \"Come, One Eye, let us sit down here and rest,  and I will sing to you.\"    One Eye seated herself, and, not being accustomed to walk so far, or to  be out in the heat of the sun, she began to feel tired, and as little  Two Eyes kept on singing, she closed her one eye and fell fast asleep.    When Two Eyes saw this, she knew that One Eye could not betray her, so  she said:      \"Little goat, if you are able,    Come and deck my pretty table.\"    She seated herself when it appeared, and ate and drank very quickly, and  when she had finished she said:      \"Little goat, when you are able,    Come and clear away my table.\"    It vanished in the twinkling of an eye; and then Two Eyes woke up One  Eye, and said, \"Little One Eye, you are a clever one to watch goats;  for, while you are asleep, they might be running all over the world.  Come, let us go home!\"    So they went to the house, and little Two Eyes again left the scraps on  the dish untouched, and One Eye could not tell her mother whether little  Two Eyes had eaten anything in the field; for she said to excuse  herself, \"I was asleep.\"    The next day the mother said to Three Eyes, \"You must go to the field  this time, and find out whether there is anyone who brings food to  little Two Eyes; for she must eat and drink secretly.\"    So when little Two Eyes started with her goat, Three Eyes followed, and  said, \"I am going with you to-day, to see if the goats are properly fed  and watched.\"    But Two Eyes knew her thoughts; so she led the goat through the long  grass to tire Three Eyes, and at last she said, \"Let us sit down here  and rest, and I will sing to you, Three Eyes.\"    She was glad to sit down, for the walk and the heat of the sun had  really tired her; and, as her sister continued her song, she was obliged  to close two of her eyes, and they slept, but not the third. In fact,  Three Eyes was wide awake with one eye, and heard and saw all that Two  Eyes did; for poor little Two Eyes, thinking she was asleep, said her  speech to the goat, and the table came with all the good things on it,  and was carried away when Two Eyes had eaten enough; and the cunning  Three Eyes saw it all with her one eye. But she pretended to be asleep  when her sister came to wake her and told her she was going home.    That evening, when little Two Eyes again left the supper they placed  aside for her, Three Eyes said to her mother, \"I know where the proud  thing gets her good eating and drinking;\" and then she described all she  had seen in the field. \"I saw it all with one eye,\" she said; \"for she  had made my other two eyes close with her fine singing, but luckily the  one in my forehead remained open.\"    Then the envious mother cried out to poor little Two Eyes, \"You wish to  have better food than we, do you? You shall lose your wish!\" She took up  a butcher's knife, went out, and stuck the good little goat in the  heart, and it fell dead.    When little Two Eyes saw this, she went out into the field, seated  herself on a mound, and wept most bitter tears.    Presently the wise woman stood again before her, and said, \"Little Two  Eyes, why do you weep?\"    \"Ah!\" she replied, \"I must weep. The goat, who every day spread my table  so beautifully, has been killed by my mother, and I shall have again to  suffer from hunger and sorrow.\"    \"Little Two Eyes,\" said the wise woman, \"I will give you some good  advice. Go home, and ask your sister to give you the inside of the  slaughtered goat, and then go and bury it in the ground in front of the  house-door.\"    On saying this the wise woman vanished.    Little Two Eyes went home quickly, and said to her sister, \"Dear sister,  give me some part of my poor goat. I don't want anything valuable; only  give me the inside.\"    Her sister laughed, and said, \"Of course you can have that, if you don't  want anything else.\"    So little Two Eyes took the inside; and in the evening, when all was  quiet, buried it in the ground outside the house-door, as the wise woman  had told her to do.    The next morning, when they all rose and looked out of the window, there  stood a most wonderful tree, with leaves of silver and apples of gold  hanging between them. Nothing in the wide world could be more beautiful  or more costly. They none of them knew how the tree could come there in  one night, excepting little Two Eyes. She supposed it had grown up from  the inside of the goat; for it stood over where she had buried it in the  earth.    Then said the mother to little One Eye, \"Climb up, my child, and break  off some of the fruit from the tree.\"    One Eye climbed up, but when she tried to catch a branch and pluck one  of the apples, it escaped from her hand, and so it happened every time  she made the attempt, and, do what she would, she could not reach one.    \"Three Eyes,\" said the mother, \"climb up, and try what you can do;  perhaps you will be able to see better with your three eyes than One Eye  can.\"    One Eye slid down from the tree, and Three Eyes climbed up. But Three  Eyes was not more skilful; with all her efforts she could not draw the  branches, nor the fruit, near enough to pluck even a leaf, for they  sprang back as she put out her hand.    At last the mother was impatient, and climbed up herself, but with no  more success, for, as she appeared to grasp a branch, or fruit, her hand  closed upon thin air.    \"May I try?\" said little Two Eyes; \"perhaps I may succeed.\"    \"You, indeed!\" cried her sisters; \"you, with your two eyes, what can you  do?\"    But Two Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not fly back from her  when she touched them, but almost laid themselves on her hand, and she  plucked them one after another, till she carried down her own little  apron full.    The mother took them from her, and gave them to her sisters, as she said  little Two Eyes did not handle them properly; but this was only from  jealousy, because little Two Eyes was the only one who could reach the  fruit, and she went into the house feeling more spiteful to her than  ever.    It happened that while all three sisters were standing under the tree  together a young knight rode by. \"Run away, quick, and hide yourself,  little Two Eyes; hide yourself somewhere, for we shall be quite ashamed  for you to be seen.\" Then they pushed the poor girl, in great haste,  under an empty cask, which stood near the tree, and several of the  golden apples that she had plucked along with her.    As the knight came nearer they saw he was a handsome man; and presently  he halted, and looked with wonder and pleasure at the beautiful tree  with its silver leaves and golden fruit.    At last he spoke to the sisters, and asked: \"To whom does this beautiful  tree belong? If a man possessed only one branch he might obtain all he  wished for in the world.\"    \"This tree belongs to us,\" said the two sisters, \"and we will break off  a branch for you if you like.\" They gave themselves a great deal of  trouble in trying to do as they offered; but all to no purpose, for the  branches and the fruit evaded their efforts, and sprung back at every  touch.    \"This is wonderful,\" exclaimed the knight, \"that the tree should belong  to you, and yet you are not able to gather even a branch.\"    They persisted, however, in declaring that the tree was their own  property. At this moment little Two Eyes, who was angry because her  sisters had not told the truth, caused two of the golden apples to slip  out from under the cask, and they rolled on till they reached the feet  of the knight's horse. When he saw them, he asked in astonishment where  they came from.    The two ugly maidens replied that they had another sister, but they  dared not let him see her, for she had only two eyes, like common  people, and was named little Two Eyes.    But the knight felt very anxious to see her, and called out, \"Little Two  Eyes, come here."]]]
