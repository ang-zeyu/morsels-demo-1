I will that they be written.    OPTATIVE MOOD.    This mood appears to have been anciently used with cáne, would that it  might be! but now in general it is not so understood. The phrase may  be deemed to be in the Optative, although it does not express that  entirely, being formed by the union of the Imperative above with  venesma, even though.      Venésmane hiósguam,                     Venésmane hiósguadauh,    I would that it might be, or,           I would that it might be, or,    Even though I may write.                Even though I may be written.    SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.    This mode of speech, If I should write, I should have written, &c.,  the natives express by adding the particle _ru_ to the future.                                     _Singular._    Nee \\                             Nee \\    Nap  > ghiósuatzeru,              Nap  > hiósquatzidauhru    Id  / If I should write, &c.      Id  /  If I should be written, &c.                                      _Plural._    Tamide\\                           Tamide\\    Emét   > hiósguatzeru,            Emét   > hiósguatzidauru,    Amet  /  If we should write, &c.  Amet  /  If we should be written, &c.[4]    [Footnote 4: Conjunctions, corresponding to _aunque, paraque, cuando_,  and the like which it is common to make use of with the subjunctive in  Spanish do not exist in the language.]    INFINITIVE MOOD.    Although this mode does not exist in the language, still the natives  have ways to express the thought, some of which are these:    One mode is by the verb erám, I wish or think; so that to say, I  wish to write, Nee hiósguavaerám may be used, which is the future  hiósguatze, with the final syllable omitted for the particle va, and  followed by the erám. In the same manner, other verbs may be proceeded  with, they remaining stable through all the mutations that erám  undergoes, as in the following:      ACTIVE VOICE.    INDICATIVE MOOD.      _Present_, Erám, I wish.          _Pluperfect_, Ehritu, I had wished.    _Imperfect_, Eramtu, I wished.    _Future_, Erátze, I shall wish.    _Perfect_, Ehri, I have wished.    SUBJUNCTIVE, (Impt?) Erátzern, I might wish, etc.    In the passive erám is not used, but naquém, which also means, I wish,  and with the preterite particle, in the manner that is stated in the  fourth form of the imperative, the infinitive mood in this voice is  expressed, as, Nee no hiósguarico naquém, I desire to be written.    Another mode that serves for the Infinitive, is that after a verb  of motion, the future of the verb is used, as to express, I come to  you to say, Nee eme queitudetze güerem: here, Nee is I; eme, to you;  güerem, or üerem, I come, and queitudetze the future of the verb  queituden, I say, or make known.    GERUNDS.    The gerund in _di_ is found in the expression: Already arrived the  time of labor; for which, taking the preterite pánauhri, the verb  pánauan signifying labor, add dagua, time, and for arrived use  hassíde, the preterite of hássem, followed by the de, particle,  signifying already, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#3)"],[1," to tell us of the war. Doubtless  you have been well informed of all, or at any rate of much, that has  passed. The man told his story quickly, with an odd quiver of excitement  in his voice, and the audience--perhaps we were 300--listened  breathless. Then for the first time we heard of Elandslaagte, of  Glencoe, of Rietfontein, a tale of stubborn, well-fought fights with  honour for both sides, triumph for neither. 'Tell us about the  losses--who are killed and wounded?' we asked this wonderful man. I  think he was a passage agent or something like that.    So he told us--and among the group of officers gathered above him on the  hurricane deck I saw now one, now another, turn away, and hurry out of  the throng. A gentleman I had met on the voyage--Captain Weldonasked  questions. 'Do you know any names of killed in the Leicesters?' The man  reflected. He could not be sure: he thought there was an officer named  Weldon killed--oh, yes! he remembered there were two Weldons--one  killed, one wounded, but he did not know which was in the Leicesters.  'Tell us about Mafeking,' said someone else. Then we heard about  Mafeking--the armoured trains, the bombardment, the sorties, the  dynamite wagons--all, in fact, that is yet known of what may become an  historic defence. 'And how many Boers are killed?' cried a private  soldier from the back. The man hesitated, but the desire to please was  strong within him. 'More than two thousand,' he said, and a fierce shout  of joy answered him. The crowd of brown uniforms under the electric  clusters broke up into loud-voiced groups; some hastened to search for  newspapers, some to repeat what they had heard to others; only a few  leaned against the bulwarks and looked long and silently towards the  land, where the lights of Cape Town, its streets, its quays, and its  houses gleamed from the night like diamonds on black velvet.    It is along casualty list of officers--of the best officers in the  world. The brave and accomplished General of Glencoe; Colonel Chisholme,  who brought the 9th Lancers out of action in Afghanistan; Sherston, who  managed the Indian Polo Association; Haldane, Sir William Lockhart's  brilliant aide-de-camp; Barnes, adjutant of the 4th Hussars, who played  back of our team and went with me to Cuba; Brooke, who had tempted  fortune more often than anyone else in the last four years--Chitral,  Matabeleland, Samana, Tira, Atbara, and Omdurman--and fifty others who  are only names to me, but are dear and precious to many, all lying under  the stony soil or filling the hospitals at Pietermaritzburg and Durban.  Two thousand Boers killed! I wish I could believe there were.    Next morning Sir Redvers Buller landed in state. Sir F. Forestier-Walker  and his staff came to meet him. The ship was decked out in bunting from  end to end. A guard of honour of the Duke of Edinburgh's Volunteers  lined the quay; a mounted escort attended the carriage; an enormous  crowd gathered outside the docks. At nine o'clock precisely the General  stepped on to the gangway. The crew and stokers of the 'Dunottar Castle'  gave three hearty cheers; the cinematograph buzzed loudly; forty cameras  clicked; the guard presented arms, and the harbour batteries thundered  the salute. Then the carriage drove briskly off into the town through  streets bright with waving flags and black with cheering people. So Sir  Redvers Buller came back again to South Africa, the land where his first  military reputation was made, where he won his Victoria Cross, the land  which--let us pray--he will leave having successfully discharged the  heavy task confided to him by the Imperial Government.    Now, what is the situation which confronts the General and the army? I  will adventure an explanation, though the picture of war moves very  swiftly. In their dealing with the military republics which had become  so formidable a power throughout the Cape, the Ministers who were  responsible for the security of our South African possessions were  compelled to reckon with two volumes of public opinion--British and  colonial. The colonial opinion was at its best (from our point of view)  about three months ago. But the British opinion was still unformed. The  delays and diplomatic disputes which have gradually roused the nation to  a sense of its responsibilities and perils, and which were absolutely  necessary if we were to embark on the struggle united, have had an  opposite effect out here. The attempts to satisfy the conscientious  public by giving the republics every possible opportunity to accept our  terms and the delays in the despatch of troops which were an expensive  tribute to the argument 'Do not seek peace with a sword,' have been  misinterpreted in South Africa. The situation in the Cape Colony has  become much graver. We have always been told of the wonderful loyalty of  the Dutch. It is possible that had war broken out three months ago that  loyalty would have been demonstrated for all time. War after three  months of hesitation--for such it was considered--has proved too severe  a test, and it is no exaggeration to say that a considerable part of the  Colony trembles on the verge of rebellion. On such a state of public  opinion the effect of any important military reverse would be  lamentable.    Nor is the military position such as to exclude anxiety. The swift flame  of war ran in a few days around the whole circle of the republican  frontiers. Far away to the north there was a skirmish at Tuli. On the  west Khama's territories are threatened with invasion. Mafeking is  surrounded, isolated, and manfully defending itself against continual  attack. Vryburg has been treacherously surrendered by its rebel  inhabitants to the enemy. Kimberley offers a serene front to a  hesitating attack, and even retaliates with armoured trains and other  enterprises. The southern frontier is armed, and menaced, and the  expectation of collision is strong. But it is on the eastern side that  the Boers have concentrated their greatest energies. They have gone Nap  on Natal. The configuration of the country favours an invader. The  reader has scarcely to look at the map, with which he is already  familiar, to realise how strategically powerful the Boer position was  and is. The long tongue of plain running up into the mountains could be  entered from both sides. The communications of the advanced garrisons  would be assailed: their retreat imperilled. The Boers seemed bound to  clear northern Natal of the troops. If, on the other hand, they were, or  should now be, suddenly driven back on their own country, they have only  to retire up the tongue of plain, with their exposed front narrowing  every mile between the mountains, and await their pursuers on the almost  inexpugnable position of Laing's Nek. Appreciating all this, their  leaders have wisely resolved to put forth their main strength against  the force in Natal, and by crushing it to rouse their sympathisers  within the Cape Colony. Should they succeed either on this front or on  any other to a serious extent, though the disaffection would not take a  very violent form, for all the bravoes have already joined the enemy,  the general insecurity would demand the employment of an army corps in  addition to that already on the seas.    A democratic Government cannot go to war unless the country is behind  it, and until it has general support must not place itself in a position  whence, without fighting, there is no retreat. The difficulty of  rallying public opinion in the face of the efforts of Mr. Morley, Mr.  Courtney, Sir William Harcourt, and others have caused a most dangerous  delay in the despatch of reinforcements. War has been aggravated by the  Peace Party; and thus these humanitarian gentlemen are personally--for  they occupy no official position--responsible for the great loss of  life. They will find their several consolations: Mr. Morley will rejoice  that he has faithfully pursued Mr. Gladstone's policy in South Africa;  Mr. Courtney that he has been consistent at all costs; Sir William  Harcourt that he has hampered the Government. But for those who lose  their sons and brothers in a quarrel thus unnecessarily extended, there  will only remain vain regrets, and to the eyewitness only a bitter  anger.    For the last three months the Imperial Government has been in the  unpleasant position of watching its adversaries grow continually  stronger without being able to make adequate counter-preparations.    But when once this initial disability has been stated, it must also be  admitted that the course of the military operations has been--apart from  their success or failure--very lucky. The Boers had the advantage of  drawing first blood, and the destruction of the armoured train near  Mafeking was magnified by them, as by the sensational Press in Great  Britain, into a serious disaster. A very bad effect was produced in the  undecided districts--it is perhaps wiser not to specify them at this  moment. But a few days later another armoured train ran out from  Kimberley, and its Maxim guns killed five Boers without any loss to the  troops. The magnifying process was also applied to this incident with  equal though opposite results. Then came the news of the battle of  Glencoe. The first accounts, which were very properly controlled--for we  are at war with the pen as well as the sword--told only of the bravery  of the troops, of the storming of the Boer position, and of the capture  of prisoners. That the troops had suffered the heavier loss, that the  Boers had retired to further positions in rear of the first, drawing  their artillery with them, and that General Yule had retreated by forced  marches to Ladysmith after the victory--for tactical victory it  undoubtedly was--leaked into Cape Colony very gradually; nor was it  until a week later that it was known that the wounded had been left  behind, and that the camp with all stores and"]]]
