To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#3)"],[1," first shone upon its face; but this inquiring  traveller could not make up his mind whether the music came from the  statue, or the base, or the people around it. He ended his tour with  watching the sunshine at the bottom of the astronomical well at Syene,  which, on the longest day, is exactly under the sun's northern edge, and  with admiring the skill of the boatmen who shot down the cataracts in  their wicker boats, for the amusement of the Roman generals.    In the earlier periods of Egyptian history Ethiopia was peopled, or, at  least, governed, by a race of men, whom, as they spoke the same language  and worshipped the same gods as their neighbours of Upper Egypt, we must  call the Kopts. But the Arabs, under the name of Troglodyte, and other  tribes, had made an early settlement on the African side of the Red Sea.  So numerous were they in Upper Egypt that in the time of Strabo half the  population of the city of Koptos were Arabs; they were the camel-drivers  and carriers for the Theban merchants in the trade across the desert.  Some of the conquests of Ramses had been over that nation in southern  Ethiopia, and the Arab power must have further risen after the defeat of  the Ethiopians by Euergetes I. Ethiopia in the time of Augustus was held  by Arabs; a race who thought peace a state of disgraceful idleness,  and war the only employment worthy of men; and who made frequent hasty  inroads into Nubia, and sometimes into Egypt. They fought for plunder,  not for conquest, and usually retreated as quickly as they came,  with such booty as they laid their hands on. To use words which were  proverbial while the Nile swarmed with crocodiles, \"They did as the dogs  do, they drank and ran away;\" and the Romans found it necessary to place  a body of troops near the cataracts of Syene to stop their marching  northward and laying waste the Thebaid. While the larger part of the  Roman legions was withdrawn into Arabia on an unsuccessful quest for  treasure, a body of thirty thousand of these men, whom we may call  either Arabs, from their blood and language, or Ethiopians, from their  country, marched northward into Egypt, and overpowered the three  Roman cohorts at Elephantine, Syene, and Philas. Badly armed and badly  trained, they were led on by the generals of Candace, Queen of Napata,  to the fourth cataract. They were, however, easily driven back when  Gallus led against them an army of ten thousand men, and drove them to  Ethiopian Pselchis, now remaining as the modern village of Dakkeh. There  he defeated them again, and took the city by storm. From Pselchis he  marched across the Nubian desert two hundred and fifty miles to Premnis,  on the northerly bend of the river, and then made himself master of  Napata, the capital. A guard was at the moment left in the country to  check any future inroads; but the Romans made no attempts to hold it.    [Illustration: 016.jpg ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT]    Of the state of the Ethiopie Arabs under Queen Candace we learn but  little from this hasty inroad; but some of the tribes must have been  very far from the barbarians that, from their ignorance of the arts  of war, the Romans judged them to be. Those nearest to the Egyptian  frontiers, the Troglodyte and Blemmyes, were unsettled, wandering, and  plundering; but the inhabitants of Meroe were of a more civilised race.  The Jews had settled in southern Ethiopia in large numbers, and for  a long time; Solomon's trade had made them acquainted with Adule and  Auxum; some of them were employed in the highest offices, and must have  brought with them the arts of civilised life. A few years later (Acts  VIII. 27) we meet with a Jewish eunuch, the treasurer of Queen Candace,  travelling with some pomp from Ethiopia to the religious festivals at  Jerusalem. The Egyptian coins of Augustus and his successors are all  Greek; the conquest of the country by the Romans made no change in its  language. Though the chief part of the population spoke Koptic, it was  still a Greek province of the Roman empire; the decrees of the prefects  of Alexandria and of the upper provinces were written in Greek; and  every Roman traveller, who, like a schoolboy, has scratched his name  upon the foot of the musical statue of Amenhothes, to let the world know  the extent of his travels, has helped to prove that the Roman government  of the country was carried on in the Greek language. The coins often  bear the eagle and thunderbolt on one side, while on the other is the  emperor's head, with his name and titles; and, after a few years, they  are all dated with the year of the emperor's reign. In the earliest he  is styled a Son of God, in imitation of the Egyptian title of Son of the  Sun. After Egypt lost its liberty, we no longer find any gold coinage in  the country; that metal, with everything else that was most costly, was  carried away to pay the Roman tribute. This was chiefly taken in money,  except, indeed, the tax on grain, which the Egyptian kings had always  received in kind, and which was still gathered in the same way, and  each year shipped to Rome, to be distributed among the idle poor of  that great city. At this time it amounted to twenty millions of bushels,  which was four times what was levied in the reign of Philadelphus.  The trade to the east was increasing, but as yet not large. About  one hundred and twenty small vessels sailed every year to India from  MyosHormos, which was now the chief port on the Red Sea.    No change was made in the Egyptian religion by this change of masters;  and, though the means of the priests were lessened, they still carried  forward the buildings which were in progress, and even began new ones.  The small temple of Isis, at Tentyra, behind the great temple of Hathor,  was either built or finished in this reign, and it was dedicated to the  goddess, and to the honour of the emperor as Jupiter Liberator, in a  Greek inscription on the cornice, in the thirty-first year of the reign,  when Publius Octavius was prefect of the province.    [Illustration: 018.jpg A KOPTIC MAIDEN]    The large temple at Talmis, in Nubia, was also then built, though not  wholly finished; and we find the name of Augustus at Philae, on some of  the additions to the temple of Isis, which had been built in the reign  of Philadelphus. In the hieroglyphical inscriptions on these temples,  Augustus is called Autocrator Caesar, and is styled Son of the Sun, King  of Upper and Lower Egypt, with the other titles which had always been  given by the priests to the Ptolemies and their own native sovereigns  for so many centuries. These claims were evidently unknown in Rome,  where the modesty of Augustus was almost proverbial.    The Greeks had at all times been forward in owning the Egyptians as  their teachers in religion; and in the dog Cerberus, the judge Minos,  the boat of Charon, and the river Styx of their mythology, we see a  clear proof that it was in Egypt that the Greeks gained their faint  glimpse of the immortality of the soul, a day of judgment, and a future  state of rewards and punishments; and, now that Rome was in close  intercourse with Egypt, the Romans were equally ready to borrow thence  their religious ceremonies. They brought to Rome the Egyptian opinions  with the statues of the gods. They ran into the new superstition to  avoid the painful uneasiness of believing nothing, and, though the  Romans ridiculed their own gods, they believed in those of Egypt. So  fashionable was the worship of Isis and Serapis becoming in Italy, that  Augustus made a law that no Egyptian ceremonies should enter the city  or even the suburbs of Rome. His subjects might copy the luxuries, the  follies, and the vices of the Alexandrians, but not the gloomy devotion  of the Egyptians. But the spread of opinions was not so checked;  even Virgil taught the doctrine of the Egyptian millennium, or the  resurrection from the dead when the thousand years were ended; and the  cripple asking for alms in the streets of Rome would beg in the name of  the holy Osiris.    Egypt felt no change on the death of Augustus. The province was well  governed during the whole of the reign of Tiberius, and the Alexandrians  completed the beautiful temple to his honour, named the Sebaste, or  Caesar's Temple. It stood by the side of the harbour, and was surrounded  with a sacred grove. It was ornamented with porticoes, and fitted up  with libraries, paintings, and statues, and was the most lofty building  in the city. In front of this temple they set up two ancient obelisks,  which had been made by Thutmosis III. and carved by Ramses II., and  which, like the other monuments of the Theban kings, have outlived  all the temples and palaces of their Greek and Roman successors. These  obelisks are now generally known as \"Cleopatra's Needles.\" One of them,  in 1878, was taken to London and set up on the Thames Embankment; the  other was soon afterward brought to New York, and is now in Central Park  in that city. It is sixty-seven feet high to its sharpened apex, and  seven feet, seven inches in diameter at its base. On its face are  deeply incised inscriptions in hieroglyphic character, giving the names  Thutmosis III., Ramses II., and Seti II.    [Illustration: 022b.jpg FRAGMENTS IN WOOD PAINTED]    The harsh justice with which Tiberius began his reign was at Rome soon  changed into a cruel tyranny; but in the provinces it was only felt as  a check to the injustice of the prefects. On one occasion, when AEmilius  Rectus sent home from Egypt a larger amount of taxes than was usual,  he hoped that his zeal would be praised by Tiberius. But the emperor's  message to the prefect was as stern as it was humane: \"I should wish my  sheep to be sheared, but not to be flayed.\" On the death of one of  the prefects, there was found among his property at Rome a statue of  Menelaus, carved in Ethiopian obsidian, which had been used in the  religious ceremonies in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"his life. Shirkuh  was then appointed vizier by El-Adid, but, dying very shortly, he was  succeeded in that dignity by his nephew Saladin (A.D. 1169).    Saladin inaugurated his reign with a series of brilliant successes.  Egypt once again took an important place among the nations, and by the  wars of Saladin it became the nucleus of a great empire. Military glory  was never the sole aim of Saladin and his successors. They continued  to extend to letters and the arts their willing patronage, and the  beneficial effects of this were felt upon the civilisation of the  country. Though ruler of Egypt, Saladin gained his greatest renown  by his campaigns against the Crusaders in Syria. The inability of Nur  ed-Din's son, El-Malik es-Salih Ismail, to govern the Syrian dominions  became an excuse for Saladin's occupation of Syria as guardian of the  young prince, and, once having assumed this function, he remained in  fact the master of Syria. He continued to consolidate his power in these  parts until the Crusaders, under Philip, Count of Flanders, laid siege  to Antioch. Saladin now went out to meet them with the Egyptian army,  and fought the fierce battle of Ascalon, which proved to be disastrous  to himself, his army being totally defeated and his life endangered.  After this, however, he was fortunate enough to gain certain minor  advantages, and continued to hold his own until a famine broke out in  Palestine which compelled him to come to terms with the Crusaders, and  two years later a truce was concluded with the King of Jerusalem, and  Saladin returned to Egypt.    In the year 576 a.h., he again entered Syria and made war on  Kilidj-Arslan, the Seljukide Sultan of Anatolia, and on Leon, King of  Armenia, both of whom he forced to come to terms. Soon after his return,  Saladin again left Egypt to prosecute a war with the Crusaders, since it  was plain that neither side was desirous of remaining at peace. Through  an incident which had just occurred, the wrath of the Crusaders had been  kindled. A vessel bearing fifteen hundred pilgrims had been wrecked  near Damietta, and its passengers captured. When the King of Jerusalem  remonstrated, Saladin replied by complaining of the constant inroads  made by Renaud de Chatillon. This restless warrior undertook an  expedition against Eyleh, and for this purpose constructed boats at  Kerak and conveyed them on camels to the sea. But this flotilla was  repulsed, and the siege was raised by a fleet sent thither by El-Adil,  the brother of Saladin, and his viceroy. A second expedition against  Eyleh was still more unfortunate to the Franks, who were defeated and  taken prisoners. On this occasion the captives were slain in the valley  of Mina. Saladin then threatened Kerak, encamped at Tiberias, and  ravaged the territory of the Franks. He next made a futile attempt to  take Beirut. He was more successful in a campaign against Mesopotamia,  which he reduced to submission, with the exception of Mosul. While  absent here, the Crusaders did little except undertake several forays,  and Saladin at length returned towards Palestine, winning many victories  and conquering Aleppo on the way. He next ravaged Samaria, and at last  received the fealty of the lord of Mosul, though he did not succeed in  actually conquering the city.    In the year 1186 war broke out again between Saladin and the Christian  hosts. The sultan had respected a truce which he had made with  Baldwin the Leper, King of Jerusalem, but the restless Renaud, who had  previously attacked Eyleh, had broken through its stipulations. His  plunder of a rich caravan enraged Saladin, who forthwith sent out orders  to all his vassals and lieutenants to prepare for a Holy War. In the  year 1187 he marched from Damascus to Kerak, where he laid close siege  to Renaud. At the same time a large body of cavalry was sent on  towards Nazareth under his son El-Afdhal. They were met by 730 Knights  Hospitallers and Templars, aided by a few hundred foot-soldiers.  Inspired by the heroic Jacques de Maille, marshal of the Temple,  they defied the large Saracen army. In the conflict which ensued, the  Crusaders immortalised themselves by fighting until only three of their  number were left alive, who, after the conflict was over, managed to  escape.    Soon after this, Saladin himself approached with a great army of eighty  thousand men, and the Christians with all their forces hastened to meet  him upon the shores of Lake Tiberias. The result of this battle proved  to be the most disastrous defeat which the Christians had yet suffered.  They were weakened by thirst, and on the second day of the conflict a  part of their troops fled. But the knights nevertheless continued to  make a heroic defence until they were overwhelmed by numbers and forced  to flee to the hills of Hittun. A great number of Crusaders fell in  this conflict, and Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, and his brother,  Renaud de Chatillon, were among the prisoners of war. The number of  those taken was very great, and Saladin left an indelible stain upon  a reign otherwise renowned for mercy and humanity by allowing the  prisoners to be massacred. Tiberias, Acre, Nabulus, Jericho, Ramleh,  Caesarea, Arsur, Jaffa, Beirut, and many other places now fell into the  hands of the conqueror.    [Illustration: 019.jpg ARAB DRINKING-VESSELS]    Tyre successfully resisted Saladin's attacks. Ascalon surrendered on  favourable conditions, and, to crown all, Jerusalem itself fell a prey  to his irresistible arms. The great clemency of Saladin is chronicled  on this occasion by Christian historians, but the same was an offence to  many of the Moslems and is but little referred to by their historians.    Tyre was now again besieged and was on the point of capture when the  besieged were relieved by the arrival of Conrad, son of the Marquis  of Monferrat. The defence was now fought with such vigour that Saladin  abandoned it and made an attack upon Tripoli, but with no better  success, although he succeeded in forcing Bohemond, Prince of Antioch,  and ruler of Tripoli, to submit on terms favourable to himself. After  this, Saladin took part in the defence of the ever-memorable siege of  Acre, which called forth deeds of gallantry and heroism on both sides,  and which lasted for two years, during which it roused the interest  of the whole of the Christian world. The invading army were in time  reinforced by the redoubtable Richard Coeur de Lion, King of England,  and Philip II. of France, and, breaking down all opposition, they  captured the city, and floated upon its walls the banners of the cross  in the year 1191 A.D. Unfortunately for the good name of the Christians,  an act of ferocious barbarity marred the lustre of their triumph, for  2,700 Moslems were cut down in cold blood in consequence of the failure  of Saladin to fulfil the terms of the capitulation; and the palliative  plea that the massacre was perpetrated in the heat of the assault can  scarcely be urged in extenuation of this enormity. While many historians  have laid the blame on King Richard, the historian Michaud believes  it rather to have been decided on in a council of the chiefs of the  Crusade.    After a period of rest and debauchery, the army of the Crusaders, led on  by King Richard, began to march towards Jerusalem. Saladin harassed his  advance and rendered the strongholds on the way defenceless and ravaged  the whole country. Richard was nevertheless ever victorious. His great  personal bravery struck terror into the Moslems, and he won an important  victory over them at Arsur. Dissensions now broke out among chiefs of  the Crusaders, and Richard himself proved to be a very uncertain  leader in regard to the strategy of the campaign. So serious were  these drawbacks that the ultimate aim of the enterprise was thereby  frustrated, and the Crusaders never attained to their great object,  which was the re-conquest of Jerusalem. At the time when the Christian  armies were in possession of all the cities along the coast, from Jaffa  to Tyre, and the hosts of Saladin were seriously disorganised, a treaty  was concluded and King Richard sailed back on the return journey to  England. The glory acquired by Saladin, and the famous campaigns of  Richard Cour de Lion, have rendered the Third Crusade the most memorable  in history, and the exploits of the heroes on both sides shed a lustre  on the arms of both Moslems and Christians.    Saladin died about a year after the conclusion of this peace, at  Damascus, A.D. 1193, at the age of fifty-seven. With less rashness and  bravery than Richard, Saladin possessed a firmer character and one far  better calculated to carry on a religious war. He paid more attention to  the results of his enterprises; more master of himself, he was more  fit to command others. When mounting the throne of the Atabegs, Saladin  obeyed rather his destiny than his inclinations; but, when once firmly  seated, he was governed by only two passions,--that of reigning and  that of securing the triumph of the Koran. On all other subjects he  was moderate, and when a kingdom or the glory of the Prophet was not  in question, the son of Ayyub was admired as the most just and mild of  Muhammedans. The stern devotion and ardent fanaticism that made him take  up arms against the Christians only rendered him cruel and barbarous  in one single instance. He displayed the virtues of peace amidst the  horrors of war. \"From the bosom of the camps,\" says an Oriental poet,  \"he covered the nations with the wings of his justice, and poured upon  his cities the plenteous showers of his liberality.\" During his reign  many remarkable public works were executed. The Muhammedans, always  governed by fear, were astonished that a sovereign could inspire them  with so much love, and followed him with joy to battle. His generosity,  his clemency, and particularly his respect for an oath, were often the  subjects "]]]
