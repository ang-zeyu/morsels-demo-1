This boon was all that they now wished to claim; and         \"King Richard spake to an old man,       'Wendes home to your Soudan!

To England will we nought gon,       Till they be eaten every one.'\"            ELLIS'S SPECIMENS OF EARLY ENGLISH METRICEL ROMANCES.    The reader may be curious to know owing to what circumstances so  extraordinary an invention as that which imputed cannibalism to the King  of England should have found its way into his history. Mr. James, to  whom we owe so much that is curious, seems to have traced the origin of  this extraordinary rumour.    \"With the army of the cross also was a multitude of men,\" the same  author declares, \"who made it a profession to be without money. They  walked barefoot, carried no arms, and even preceded the beasts of burden  in their march, living upon roots and herbs, and presenting a spectacle  both disgusting and pitiable.    \"A Norman, who, according to all accounts, was of noble birth, but who,  having lost his horse, continued to follow as a foot soldier, took  the strange resolution of putting himself at the head of this race  of vagabonds, who willingly received him as their king. Amongst the  Saracens these men became well known under the name of THAFURS (which  Guibert translates TRUDENTES), and were beheld with great horror  from the general persuasion that they fed on the dead bodies of their  enemies; a report which was occasionally justified, and which the king  of the Thafurs took care to encourage. This respectable monarch was  frequently in the habit of stopping his followers, one by one, in a  narrow defile, and of causing them to be searched carefully, lest the  possession of the least sum of money should render them unworthy of the  name of his subjects. If even two sous were found upon any one, he  was instantly expelled the society of his tribe, the king bidding him  contemptuously buy arms and fight.    \"This troop, so far from being cumbersome to the army, was infinitely  serviceable, carrying burdens, bringing in forage, provisions, and  tribute; working the machines in the sieges; and, above all, spreading  consternation among the Turks, who feared death from the lances of the  knights less than that further consummation they heard of under the  teeth of the Thafurs.\" [James's \"History of Chivalry.\"]    It is easy to conceive that an ignorant minstrel, finding the taste and  ferocity of the Thafurs commemorated in the historical accounts of the  Holy Wars, has ascribed their practices and propensities to the Monarch  of England, whose ferocity was considered as an object of exaggeration  as legitimate as his valour.    ABBOTSFORD, 1st July, 1832.            TALES OF THE CRUSADERS. TALE II.--THE TALISMAN.          CHAPTER I.         They, too, retired       To the wilderness, but 'twas with arms.           PARADISE REGAINED.    The burning sun of Syria had not yet attained its highest point in  the horizon, when a knight of the Red Cross, who had left his distant  northern home and joined the host of the Crusaders in Palestine, was  pacing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the vicinity of the  Dead Sea, or, as it is called, the Lake Asphaltites, where the waves of  the Jordan pour themselves into an inland sea, from which there is no  discharge of waters.    The warlike pilgrim had toiled among cliffs and precipices during the  earlier part of the morning. More lately, issuing from those rocky  and dangerous defiles, he had entered upon that great plain, where  the accursed cities provoked, in ancient days, the direct and dreadful  vengeance of the Omnipotent.    The toil, the thirst, the dangers of the way, were forgotten, as the  traveller recalled the fearful catastrophe which had converted into an  arid and dismal wilderness the fair and fertile valley of Siddim, once  well watered, even as the Garden of the Lord, now a parched and blighted  waste, condemned to eternal sterility.    Crossing himself, as he viewed the dark mass of rolling waters, in  colour as in duality unlike those of any other lake, the traveller  shuddered as he remembered that beneath these sluggish waves lay the  once proud cities of the plain, whose grave was dug by the thunder of  the heavens, or the eruption of subterraneous fire, and whose remains  were hid, even by that sea which holds no living fish in its bosom,  bears no skiff on its surface, and, as if its own dreadful bed were the  only fit receptacle for its sullen waters, sends not, like other lakes,  a tribute to the ocean. The whole land around, as in the days of Moses,  was \"brimstone and salt; it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass  groweth thereon.\" The land as well as the lake might be termed dead, as  producing nothing having resemblance to vegetation, and even the very  air was entirely devoid of its ordinary winged inhabitants, deterred  probably by the odour of bitumen and sulphur which the burning sun  exhaled from the waters of the lake in steaming clouds, frequently  assuming the appearance of waterspouts. Masses of the slimy and  sulphureous substance called naphtha, which floated idly on the sluggish  and sullen waves, supplied those rolling clouds with new vapours, and  afforded awful testimony to the truth of the Mosaic history.    Upon this scene of desolation the sun shone with almost intolerable  splendour, and all living nature seemed to have hidden itself from the  rays, excepting the solitary figure which moved through the flitting  sand at a foot's pace, and appeared the sole breathing thing on the wide  surface of the plain. The dress of the rider and the accoutrements of  his horse were peculiarly unfit for the traveller in such a country. A  coat of linked mail, with long sleeves, plated gauntlets, and a steel  breastplate, had not been esteemed a sufficient weight of armour; there  were also his triangular shield suspended round his neck, and his barred  helmet of steel, over which he had a hood and collar of mail, which  was drawn around the warrior's shoulders and throat, and filled up the  vacancy between the hauberk and the headpiece. His lower limbs were  sheathed, like his body, in flexible mail, securing the legs and thighs,  while the feet rested in plated shoes, which corresponded with the  gauntlets. A long, broad, straight-shaped, double-edged falchion, with  a handle formed like a cross, corresponded with a stout poniard on the  other side. The knight also bore, secured to his saddle, with one end  resting on his stirrup, the long steel-headed lance, his own proper  weapon, which, as he rode, projected backwards, and displayed its little  pennoncelle, to dally with the faint breeze, or drop in the dead calm.  To this cumbrous equipment must be added a surcoat of embroidered cloth,  much frayed and worn, which was thus far useful that it excluded the  burning rays of the sun from the armour, which they would otherwise have  rendered intolerable to the wearer. The surcoat bore, in several places,  the arms of the owner, although much defaced. These seemed to be a  couchant leopard, with the motto, \"I sleep; wake me not.\" An outline of  the same device might be traced on his shield, though many a blow had  almost effaced the painting. The flat top of his cumbrous cylindrical  helmet was unadorned with any crest. In retaining their own unwieldy  defensive armour, the Northern Crusaders seemed to set at defiance the  nature of the climate and country to which they had come to war.    The accoutrements of the horse were scarcely less massive and unwieldy  than those of the rider. The animal had a heavy saddle plated with  steel, uniting in front with a species of breastplate, and behind with  defensive armour made to cover the loins. Then there was a steel axe,  or hammer, called a mace-of-arms, and which hung to the saddle-bow. The  reins were secured by chain-work, and the front-stall of the bridle was  a steel plate, with apertures for the eyes and nostrils, having in the  midst a short, sharp pike, projecting from the forehead of the horse  like the horn of the fabulous unicorn.    But habit had made the endurance of this load of panoply a second  nature, both to the knight and his gallant charger. Numbers, indeed,  of the Western warriors who hurried to Palestine died ere they became  inured to the burning climate; but there were others to whom that  climate became innocent and even friendly, and among this fortunate  number was the solitary horseman who now traversed the border of the  Dead Sea.    Nature, which cast his limbs in a mould of uncommon strength, fitted  to wear his linked hauberk with as much ease as if the meshes had been  formed of cobwebs, had endowed him with a constitution as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#3)"],[1," for canning should be in all kitchens: four-quart  kettle for blanching; steamer for steaming greens; colander; quart  measure; funnel; good rubber rings; sharp paring knives; jar opener;  wire basket and a piece of cheesecloth one yard square for blanching;  pineapple scissors; one large preserving spoon; one tablespoon; one  teaspoon; one set of measuring spoons; measuring cup; jar lifter;  either a rack for several jars or individual jar holders; and a clock.    The manufacturers, realizing that boys and girls must be kept busy  during the vacation months, have made some wonderful devices for  outdoor canning. Would it not be a good plan to buy one for the young  people of your family and give them something definite and worth while  to do in summer? You know little brains and hands must be kept  busy--if not usefully employed they are often inclined to mischief.  This type of cooker furnishes its own heat; so it can be used in the  back yard, in the orchard or under the trees in the front yard.    Remember that the higher the altitude the lower the degree of heat  required to boil water. Time-tables given in instructions for canning  are usually based upon the requirements of an altitude of 500 feet  above sea level. Generally speaking, for every 4000-foot increase in  altitude it will be well to add twenty per cent to the time required  as given in recipes or time schedules for the canning of all kinds of  fruits, vegetables, greens and meats.          CHAPTER II    SOFT FRUITS AND BERRIES      Having decided on your canning outfit, whether you are going to can in  boiling water, in a condensed steam cooker, or in steam under  pressure; having gathered together the necessary tools, such as  spoons, knives and a funnel; having raided the storeroom and collected  some jars, you are now ready for the actual work of canning.    It is rather unfortunate that strawberries should be one of the very  hardest products to can with good results. The canning itself is  simple--all berries are quickly and easily canned--but strawberries  always shrink, are apt to turn a little brown, and, what distresses us  most of all, they float to the top of the jar.    The berry's tendency to shrink is responsible for loss of color as  well as its floating qualities. However, if you will be exceedingly  careful to remove the berries from the canner the minute the clock  says the sterilizing period is over, you will have a fairly good  product. Two minutes too long will produce a very dark, shrunken  berry. So be careful of the cooking time. Another thing that makes a  good-looking jar is to pack a quart of berries--all kinds of berries,  not merely strawberries--into a pint jar. If you will get that many in  you will have a much better-looking jar, with very little liquid at  the bottom. It does not hurt the berries at all to gently press down  on them with a silver spoon while you are packing them into the jar.    We know we are going to get a quart of berries into every pint jar,  so we know just how many quarts of berries we will need to fill the  necessary jars for the next winter's use.    The first thing to do is to test each jar to see that there are no  cracks, no rough edges to cut the rubber, and to see whether the cover  and clamp fit tightly, if a clamp type of jar is used. The bail that  clamps down the glass tops should go down with a good spring. If it  does not, remove the bail and bend it into shape by taking it in both  hands and pressing down in the middle with both thumbs. Do not bend it  too hard, for if it goes down with too much of a snap it will break  the jar. This testing of the bails should be done every year. The  bails on new jars are sometimes too tight, in which case remove the  bail and spread it out. After the bail has been readjusted, test it  again. The chances are it will be just right. Of course all this  testing takes time, but it pays.    If you are using some old Mason jars put a rubber on each jar, fill  the jar with hot water, and then put the cover on tight and invert.  This is a sure test for leakage. Never use a Mason cap twice unless  the cover and collar are separate so that both can be completely  sterilized. Fortunately the old-fashioned Mason jar metal cover to  which a porcelain cap is fastened is going out of style.    If you still have some of these old covers it will be economy to throw  them away. You will be money ahead in the end. After these tops have  been used once it is impossible to make a fastening between the  porcelain and the metal so tight that it is not possible for the  liquid to seep through and cause the contents to spoil. This accounts  for many failures when old tops are used. For this reason never use  the old-fashioned, zinc-topped covers.    The new and safe Mason jar covers consist of two parts, the metal  collar and the porcelain cap. They are for sale at all grocery or  hardware stores.    If you are using the vacuum-seal jars which have a composition  attached to the lacquered tops, carefully examine this rubber  composition to see that it is perfect. This composition should go  entirely round the top and should not be cut or broken in any place.  If it is the top must be discarded for a perfect one.    Of course with this type of jar no rubber rings are necessary, as the  rubber composition on the lacquered top does the sealing.    It is a wise plan to go round the tops and over the inside of all new  glass jars with a heavy and dull knife to scrape off any slivers of  glass or bursted blisters that may be still clinging to the jars.  Those on the tops cut through the rubber and cause leakage. Those in  the jars may get into the product. I often find these splinters,  particularly on new straight-sided jars.    It matters not what type of jar you use. Use what you have at hand,  but if you are buying new jars consider the following things before  making your selections: No metal, unless it is enameled or lacquered,  should come in contact with the food. The jars should be of smooth,  well-finished glass. The color of the jar does not affect the keeping  qualities of the food. The top or part of the top that comes in  contact with the contents should be all in one piece, so as not to  offer a place for the accumulation of organisms and dirt. The jars  which have nearly straight sides and a wide mouth or opening are  easier to wash and facilitate better, quicker and easier packing of  the product.    Wash the jars in soap and water. Rinse in boiling water. Some people  temper new jars so they will stand the shock of hot water or hot sirup  without breaking. If you wish to take this extra precaution put the  jars in a dishpan or kettle of cold water after they have been washed  in soapy water; bring the water slowly to a boil and let it boil  fifteen minutes. After the jars are ready test the rubber rings. This  may seem a useless precaution, but it is a necessary one, for there is  no one detail in the business of canning that is more important. Even  in the best boxes of rubbers there is occasionally a black sheep, and  one black sheep may cause the loss of a jar.    Test each rubber before you use it by pressing it firmly between the  thumbs and forefingers, stretching it very slightly. If it seems soft  and spongy discard it. All rubbers fit for canning should be firm,  elastic, and should endure a stretching pull without breaking. A good  rubber ring will return promptly to place without changing the inside  diameter.    A great many women are laboring under the wrong impression that color  affects the quality of a ring. Some women insist on red, and others on  white. Color is given to rings by adding coloring matter during the  manufacturing process. The color of the ring is no index to its  usefulness in home canning.    Use only fresh, sound strawberries or other berries. There is a little  knack about preparing the strawberries that few housewives know. Hull  the berries by _twisting the berries off the hull_, instead of pulling  the hull from the berry as most women do. You will have a  better-looking berry if you will be careful about this. Place the  berries in a strainer and pour cold water over them to cleanse them.      HOW TO ADJUST THE COVERS    Never allow the berries or any fruit to stand in water, as the flavor  and color are destroyed by water-soaking. Pack in glass jars, pressing  the berries down tightly, but without crushing them. Put the rubber on  the jar if you are using a jar requiring a rubber. Pour hot sirup over  the berries. Put the top of the jar in place, but only partially  tighten it.    If using the screw-top jars, such as the Mason, screw down with the  thumb and little finger, not using force but stopping when the cover  catches.    If using vacuum-seal jars put the cover on and the spring in place.  The spring will give enough to allow the steam to escape.    In using glass-top jars with the patent wire snap, put the cover in  place, the wire over the top and leave the clamp up.    The cover on a glass jar must not be tight while the product is  cooking, because the air will expand when heated, and if the cover is  not loose enough to allow the steam to escape the pressure may blow  the rubber out or break the jar.    The product is now ready for the canner.      STERILIZING    If you are using the homemade outfit, such as wash-boiler or garbage  pail, all berries and soft fruits are sterilized sixteen minutes; in  all commercial hot-water-bath outfits and in condensed steam, sixteen  minutes; in the water-seal, twelve minutes; in the steam pressure  under five pounds of steam, ten minutes; and in the pressure cooker  under ten pounds of steam, five minutes. Do not allow the pressure to  run above ten pounds for soft fruits; fifteen pounds makes them mushy.    If you use any type of hot-water-bath outfit be sure the water is  boiling when the fruit is lowered into the canner, and _keep it  boiling_ vigorously"]]]
