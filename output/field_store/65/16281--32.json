Mr. Britling looked over his right shoulder and considered problems of  curvature and distance. \"I think,\" he said, \"I will go round outside the  park. It will take us a little longer, but it will be simpler than  backing and manoeuvring here now.... These electric starters are  remarkably convenient things. Otherwise now I should have to get down  and wind up the engine.\"    After that came a corner, the rounding of which seemed to present few  difficulties until suddenly Mr. Britling cried out, \"Eh! _eh_! EH! Oh,  _damn_!\"    Then the two gentlemen were sitting side by side in a rather sloping car  that had ascended the bank and buried its nose in a hedge of dog-rose  and honeysuckle, from which two missel thrushes, a blackbird and a  number of sparrows had made a hurried escape....      Section 5    \"Perhaps,\" said Mr. Britling without assurance, and after a little  peaceful pause, \"I can reverse out of this.\"    He seemed to feel some explanation was due to Mr. Direck. \"You see,  at first--it's perfectly simple--one steers _round_ a corner and then  one doesn't put the wheels straight again, and so one keeps on going  round--more than one meant to. It's the bicycle habit; the bicycle  rights itself. One expects a car to do the same thing. It was my fault.  The book explains all this question clearly, but just at the moment  I forgot.\"    He reflected and experimented in a way that made the engine scold  and fuss....    \"You see, she won't budge for the reverse.... She's--embedded.... Do you  mind getting out and turning the wheel back? Then if I reverse, perhaps  we'll get a move on....\"    Mr. Direck descended, and there were considerable efforts.    \"If you'd just grip the spokes. Yes, so.... One, Two, Three!... No!  Well, let's just sit here until somebody comes along to help us. Oh!  Somebody will come all right. Won't you get up again?\"    And after a reflective moment Mr. Direck resumed his seat beside  Mr. Britling....      Section 6    The two gentlemen smiled at each other to dispel any suspicion of  discontent.    \"My driving leaves something to be desired,\" said Mr. Britling with  an air of frank impartiality. \"But I have only just got this car for  myself--after some years of hired cars--the sort of lazy arrangement  where people supply car, driver, petrol, tyres, insurance and everything  at so much a month. It bored me abominably. I can't imagine now how  I stood it for so long. They sent me down a succession of compact,  scornful boys who used to go fast when I wanted to go slow, and slow  when I wanted to go fast, and who used to take every corner on the  wrong side at top speed, and charge dogs and hens for the sport of it,  and all sorts of things like that. They would not even let me choose my  roads. I should have got myself a car long ago, and driven it, if it  wasn't for that infernal business with a handle one had to do when the  engine stopped. But here, you see, is a reasonably cheap car with an  electric starter--American, I need scarcely say. And here I am--going  at my own pace.\"    Mr. Direck glanced for a moment at the pretty disorder of the hedge in  which they were embedded, and smiled and admitted that it was certainly  much more agreeable.    Before he had finished saying as much Mr. Britling was talking again.    He had a quick and rather jerky way of speaking; he seemed to fire out a  thought directly it came into his mind, and he seemed to have a loaded  magazine of thoughts in his head. He spoke almost exactly twice as fast  as Mr. Direck, clipping his words much more, using much compacter  sentences, and generally cutting his corners, and this put Mr. Direck  off his game.    That rapid attack while the transatlantic interlocutor is deploying is  indeed a not infrequent defect of conversations between Englishmen and  Americans. It is a source of many misunderstandings. The two conceptions  of conversation differ fundamentally. The English are much less disposed  to listen than the American; they have not quite the same sense of  conversational give and take, and at first they are apt to reduce their  visitors to the role of auditors wondering when their turn will begin.  Their turn never does begin. Mr. Direck sat deeply in his slanting seat  with a half face to his celebrated host and said \"Yep\" and \"Sure\" and  \"That _is_ so,\" in the dry grave tones that he believed an Englishman  would naturally expect him to use, realising this only very gradually.    Mr. Britling, from his praise of the enterprise that had at last brought  a car he could drive within his reach, went on to that favourite topic  of all intelligent Englishmen, the adverse criticism of things British.  He pointed out that the central position of the brake and gear levers in  his automobile made it extremely easy for the American manufacturer to  turn it out either as a left-handed or a right-handed car, and so adapt  it either to the Continental or to the British rule of the road. No  English cars were so adaptable. We British suffered much from our  insular rule of the road, just as we suffered much from our insular  weights and measures. But we took a perverse pride in such  disadvantages. The irruption of American cars into England was a recent  phenomenon, it was another triumph for the tremendous organising ability  of the American mind. They were doing with the automobile what they had  done with clocks and watches and rifles, they had standardised and  machined wholesale, while the British were still making the things one  by one. It was an extraordinary thing that England, which was the  originator of the industrial system and the original developer of the  division of labour, should have so fallen away from systematic  manufacturing. He believed this was largely due to the influence of  Oxford and the Established Church....    At this point Mr. Direck was moved by an anecdote. \"It will help to  illustrate what you are saying, Mr. Britling, about systematic  organisation if I tell you a little incident that happened to a friend  of mine in Toledo, where they are setting up a big plant with a view to  capturing the entire American and European market in the class of the  thousand-dollar car--\"    \"There's no end of such little incidents,\" said Mr. Britling, cutting in  without apparent effort. \"You see, we get it on both sides. Our  manufacturer class was, of course, originally an insurgent class. It was  a class of distended craftsmen. It had the craftsman's natural  enterprise and natural radicalism. As soon as it prospered and sent its  boys to Oxford it was lost. Our manufacturing class was assimilated in  no time to the conservative classes, whose education has always had a  mandarin quality--very, very little of it, and very cold and choice. In  America you have so far had no real conservative class at all. Fortunate  continent! You cast out your Tories, and you were left with nothing but  Whigs and Radicals. But our peculiar bad luck has been to get a sort of  revolutionary who is a Tory mandarin too. Ruskin and Morris, for  example, were as reactionary and anti-scientific as the dukes and the  bishops. Machine haters. Science haters. Rule of Thumbites to the bone.  So are our current Socialists. They've filled this country with the idea  that the ideal automobile ought to be made entirely by the hand labour  of traditional craftsmen, quite individually, out of beaten copper,  wrought iron and seasoned oak. All this electric-starter business and  this electric lighting outfit I have here, is perfectly hateful to the  English mind.... It isn't that we are simply backward in these things,  we are antagonistic. The British mind has never really tolerated  electricity; at least, not that sort of electricity that runs through  wires. Too slippery and glib for it. Associates it with Italians and  fluency generally, with Volta, Galvani, Marconi and so on. The proper  British electricity is that high-grade useless long-sparking stuff you  get by turning round a glass machine; stuff we used to call frictional  electricity. Keep it in Leyden jars.... At Claverings here they still  refuse to have electric bells. There was a row when the Solomonsons, who  were tenants here for a time, tried to put them in....\"    Mr. Direck had followed this cascade of remarks with a patient smile and  a slowly nodding head. \"What you say,\" he said, \"forms a very marked  contrast indeed with the sort of thing that goes on in America. This  friend of mine I was speaking of, the one who is connected with an  automobile factory in Toledo--\"    \"Of course,\" Mr. Britling burst out again, \"even conservatism isn't an  ultimate thing. After all, we and your enterprising friend at Toledo,  are very much the same blood. The conservatism, I mean, isn't racial.  And our earlier energy shows it isn't in the air or in the soil. England  has become unenterprising and sluggish because England has been so  prosperous and comfortable....\"    \"Exactly,\" said Mr. Direck. \"My friend of whom I was telling you, was a  man named Robinson, which indicates pretty clearly that he was of  genuine English stock, and, if I may say so, quite of your build and  complexion; racially, I should say, he was, well--very much what you  are....\"      Section 7    This rally of Mr. Direck's mind was suddenly interrupted.    Mr. Britling stood up, and putting both hands to the sides of his mouth,  shouted \"Yi-ah! Aye-ya! Thea!\" at unseen hearers.    After shouting again, several times, it became manifest that he had  attracted the attention of two willing but deliberate labouring men.  They emerged slowly, first as attentive heads, from the landscape."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14064"],[0,"Mohammed, The Prophet of Islam (#3)"],[1,"in the day of trouble; and He       knoweth them that trust in Him.\"    In the light of such lofty teaching, the conceptions of Mohammed  appear gross and degraded. His asceticism and contemplation never  brought him a vision of God that overwhelmed him and purified as by  fire. He knew the Creator only from what he heard from the lips of  sinful, ignorant men, whose ideas of Deity were base and ignoble.  These ideas, and the passions that made up such a large portion of his  life, obscured his vision, warped his judgment, and led him to  postulate a God that inhabited not a Holy Spiritual Realm, but a  grossly carnal and sensuous paradise.    Millions have been brought beneath his sway because his system panders  to the natural inclinations of man. Spiritual insight is blinded by  carnal desire; conduct is influenced by unbridled license; bigotry and  hatred are fostered by his policy of intoleration; and his followers  are enslaved by a tyranny that blights the reason, because it  discountenances inquiry, and places an insurmountable barrier in the  way of all human progress.    In studying the life of Mohammed, the cause of his failure to uplift  humanity will be clearly seen. His early sincerity, if sincerity it  can be named, was absorbed by his consuming ambition. Had it been  otherwise he might have had his name inscribed with the honourable  ones of the earth--those men whose claims are ratified by their happy  effects. As it is, his name is linked with those whose deeds cause a  shudder of horror and repulsion to all who love honesty, purity, and  truth.          I.--EARLY LIFE.      Mohammed was born in Mecca, a town in Arabia, about seventy miles  inland from the Red Sea. His father, who died 570 A.D., a few months  before the child was born, was a member of the Banu Hashim clan. His  family, although well connected, was a humble one, possessing but  little wealth. On the death of his mother some six years later, the  child was taken by his grandfather, 'ABD-EL-MUTTALIB, who took care of  him for two years. Then he was adopted by his uncle, ABU TALIB, who  employed him to look after his flocks and herds.    From his earliest years, Mohammed must have been brought into contact  with the religious life of Mecca, for his grandfather was custodian of  the Kaaba, or temple, and would frequently take the boy with him on  his official visits to the place. The numerous images of the gods set  up in the temple would be familiar objects to the future prophet,  whose iconoclastic zeal was eventually to bring about their  destruction. His lonely shepherd life favoured the cultivation of the  contemplative habits of his manhood, and played no unimportant part in  the development of those characteristics which eminently fitted him  for the life he was to lead. Nature had endowed him with the essential  abilities of a commander of men, and his early environment provided a  training that enabled him to exercise those gifts most advantageously.    The population of Arabia at this time consisted of numerous  independent nomadic tribes, who were often at enmity one with another.  Political unity there was none, while each tribe had its own patron,  or god, which was considered to be responsible for everything  concerning the tribe's welfare. Where tribes were united, or at peace,  there the individual gods were supposed to be friendly. Even in Mecca,  which for many years had been occupied by a settled community, there  was no political or judicial organisation. The existing order was  maintained by a form of patriarchal government, under which system it  was possible for the head of a tribe or clan, to protect the life of  any individual he chose to befriend.    The religious beliefs and customs were evidently gross materialistic  corruptions of what had once been a purely spiritual worship. Mohammed  had been preceded by men who had from time to time, in spite of the  moral and intellectual darkness, been so endowed with spiritual  perception as to recognise and bewail the hollowness and degradation  of the Pagan system. Some, indeed, had been conscientious enough to  utter words of condemnation; others had gone so far as to despise and  ridicule its claims. So that when Mohammed was born the people were in  a condition of religious uncertainty. Many elements contributed to  this unrest. Travellers learned that the more prosperous nations had  rejected the age long sanctions of Paganism; earnest, thoughtful men  could not but recognise its inadequacy to satisfy the religious  aspirations of their fellows; Jews and Christians, who had settled in  the country, had introduced views that appealed to those who were  dissatisfied with the old methods of thought; while the need for  social and political unity called for a force that would unite the  scattered tribes in the pursuit of common ideals. Thus was the land  prepared for the mighty revolution that was to come--a revolution that  made one great nation of the various tribes, and turned their warlike  instincts and characteristic fanaticism, which before had been  dissipated by wasteful internecine strife, into one definite channel,  until it became a menace to the whole world. A change so potent, that,  in the lifetime of one man, it was able to obliterate partly by  absorption, and chiefly by annihilation, the sanctions and beliefs of  centuries, and which fostered a hatred so bitter, and a brotherhood so  strong, between man and man, that by its sanction the dearest,  tenderest, and strongest ties of humanity have been broken, while  those who for years had lived in enmity were united in bonds stronger  than death. Under its malevolent influence, children have ruthlessly  slain their parents, believing that thus would they merit heaven. And  men of different race have fought side by side under one banner,  hurling themselves with fanatical heroism upon their enemies,  believing that to die in such a way meant the winning of an immortal  crown.    During his boyhood, Mohammed had plenty of opportunities for observing  the condition of affairs, and, thanks to his privilege of travelling  with the caravans, was even able to notice the contrast between the  conditions of his own people and those of the more peaceable,  prosperous nations. He frequently attended upon his uncle in the  fighting that often occurred between the tribes, and so gained the  knowledge of military strategy which proved to be so useful at a later  time. Margoliouth suggests that the two most important lessons the  \"prophet\" learned at this time were the necessity of settling affairs  of blood by some expedient less wasteful, and more satisfactory than  that which was illustrated by the war of Fizar, and that war should be  regarded not as a game, but as a mode of obtaining decisive results.    The varied experiences he passed through on his caravan journeys did  much to influence his future policy; indeed, it appears that all  influences brought to bear upon his early life were forces that  moulded and equipped him for the office he was to fill. He was keenly  observant, and wonderfully accurate in his inferences, especially in  his estimate of the characters of men with whom he had to deal. He  seemed to lack initiative, for he was always reluctant to take action  in any important undertaking; but once the initial step was taken, he  pressed forward with indomitable courage. In his business transactions  he proved himself to be shrewd and tactful, and by his fidelity,  patience, and self-confidence, gained the respect and esteem of his  immediate fellows.    Khadijah, a rich widow, having entrusted Mohammed with the control of  an important caravan, and finding how admirably he had performed his  part, wisely concluded that her interests would be furthered if he had  a share in them. Hence their marriage, which happy arrangement proved  to be mutually blessed and successful. It vastly improved Mohammed's  social standing, raising him to a position of equality with the  leading men of the city. For many years he was content to live quietly  as an ordinary citizen, engrossed in the accumulation of wealth by  legitimate trading.          II.--THE \"CALL\" TO THE PROPHETIC OFFICE.      It has not been recorded how first he began to yield to the impulses  that eventually led him to assume the role of reformer, but it is  certain that at the age of forty he was the leader of a secret  society, which had for its object the political and religious unity of  the Arab people. He knew that far-reaching changes were necessary in  every department of national policy before his ideal could be  realised. Unity was the secret of power and prosperity. This he had  learned through contact with other nations. His dealing with Jews and  Christians had given rise to a deep appreciation of the value of a  monotheistic faith in the consolidation of a people, and he was  convinced that political unity would be achieved only where there was  religious unity. With masterly insight he laid his plans accordingly,  and because of the extreme conservatism was obliged to formulate them  in strict secrecy. Unfortunately, owing to his untrustworthy sources  of information, his policy was founded upon false bases. His distorted  conception of truth led him to establish a system of false philosophy  and theology so framed as to allow of no alteration or adaptation. In  his elaboration of the system, he depended much upon his own  meditative habits, and no doubt thought it all out in the loneliness  of the mountains, to which he frequently retired for the observance of  certain ascetic customs of the Pagans. Thus his scheme of reform  crystallised into definite shape, and his call to the prophetic office  became a fixed idea.    He felt certain that success lay in the determined proclamation of one  god as opposed to the many of the Arab pantheon, and the more he  pondered over this Being, of whom he had heard from the Jews "]]]
