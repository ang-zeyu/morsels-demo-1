No one can estimate the     value of the losses entailed by the _absence_ of free intercourse     due to removable linguistic barriers. Potential (but at present     non-realized) extension of goodwill, swifter progress, and wider     knowledge represent one side of their value; while consequent     non-realized increase in volume of actual business represents their     value in money. The negative statement of absence of results from     intercourse that never took place affords no measure of positive     results obtainable under a better system.    The tendency of those engaged in advancing material progress, which  consists in the subjection of nature to man's ends, is to adapt more and  more quickly their methods to changing conditions. Has the world yet  faced in a business-like spirit the problem of wiping out wastage on  words?    Big industrial concerns scrap machinery while it is yet perfectly  capable of running and turning out good work, in order to replace it by  newer machinery, capable of turning out more work in the same time. Time  is money. Can the busy world afford a language difficulty?    (3) The proposition that it is economically sounder to carry on  international intercourse in one easy language than in a large number of  hard ones rests upon the principle that it does not pay to do a thing a  hard way, if the same results can be produced by an easy way.    The whole industrial revolution brought about by the invention of  machinery depended upon this principle. Since an artificial language,  like machinery, is a means invented by man of furthering his ends, there  seems to be no abuse of analogy in comparing them.    When it was found that machinery would turn out a hundred pieces of  cloth while the hand-loom turned out one, the hand-loom was doomed,  except in so far as it may serve other ends, antiquarian, aesthetic, or  artistic, which are not equally well served by machinery. Similarly,  to take another revolution which is going on in our own day through  a further application of machinery, when it is found that corn can  be reaped and threshed by machinery, that hay can be cut, made,  carried, and stacked by machinery, that man can travel the high road  by machinery, sooner or later machinery is bound to get the bulk of  the job, because it produces the same results at greater speed and  less cost. So, in the field of international intercourse, if an easy  artificial language can with equal efficiency and at less cost produce  the same results as a multiplicity of natural ones, in many lines  of human activity, and making all reserves in matters antiquarian,  aesthetic, and artistic, sooner or later the multiplicity will have to  go to the scrap-heap[1] as cumbrous and out of date. It may be a hundred  years; it may be fifty; it may be even twenty. Almost certainly the  irresistible trend of economic pressure will work its will and insist  that what has to be done shall be done in the most economical way.       [1]But only, of course, in those lines in which an international     auxiliary language can produce equally good results. This excludes     home use, national literature, philology, scholarly study of national     languages, etc.    So much, then, for the question of principle. In treating it, certain  large assumptions have been made; e.g. it is said above, \"if an easy  artificial language can with equal efficiency... produce the same  results,\" etc. Here it is assumed that the artificial language is (1)  easy, and (2) that it is possible for it to produce the same results.  Again, however easy and possible, its introduction might cost more than  it saved. These are questions of fact, and are treated in the three  following chapters under the heading of \"The Question of Practice.\"                                        III        THE QUESTION OF PRACTICE--AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE IS POSSIBLE    The man who says a thing is impossible without troubling to find out  whether it has been done is merely \"talking through his hat,\" to use  an Americanism, and we need not waste much time on him. Any one, who  maintains that it is impossible to transact the ordinary business of  life and write lucid treatises on scientific and other subjects in an  artificial language, is simply in the position of the French engineer,  who gave a full scientific demonstration of the fact that an engine  could not possibly travel by steam.    The plain fact is that not only one artificial language, but several,  already exist, which not only can express, but already have expressed  all the ideas current in social intercourse, business, and serious  exposition. It is only necessary to state the facts briefly.    First--_Volapük_.    Three congresses were held in all for the promotion of this language.  The third (Paris, 1889) was the most important. It was attended by  Volapükists from many different nations, who carried on all their  business in Volapük, and found no difficulty in understanding one  another. Besides this, there were a great many newspapers published in  Volapük, which treated of all kinds of subjects.    Secondly--_Idiom Neutral_, the lineal descendant of Volapük.    It is regulated by an international academy, which sends round circulars  and does all its business in Idiom Neutral.    Thirdly--_Esperanto_.    Since the publication of the language in 1887 it has had a gradually  increasing number of adherents, who have used it for all ordinary  purposes of communication. A great number of newspapers and reviews of  all kinds are now published regularly in Esperanto in a great variety  of countries. I take up a chance number of the _Internacia Scienca  Revuo_, which happens to be on my table, and find the following subjects  among the contents of the month: \"_Rôle_ of living beings in the general  physiology of the earth,\" \"The carnivorous animals of Sweden,\" \"The part  played by heredity in the etiology of chronic nephritis,\" \"The migration  of the lemings,\" \"Notices of books,\" \"Notes and correspondence,\" etc.  In fact, the Review has all the appearance of an ordinary scientific  periodical, and the articles are as clearly expressed and as easy to  read as those in any similar review in a national language.    Even more convincing perhaps, for the uninitiated, is the evidence  afforded by the International Congresses of Esperantists. The first was  held at Boulogne in August 1905. It marked an epoch in the lives of  many of the participants, whose doubts as to the practical nature of an  artificial language there, for good and all, yielded to the logic of  facts; and it may well be that it will some day be rather an outstanding  landmark in the history of civilization. A brief description will,  therefore, not be out of place.    In the little seaport town on the north coast of France had come  together men and women of more than twenty different races. Some were  experts, some were beginners; but all save a very few must have been  alike in this, that they had learnt their Esperanto at home, and, as  far as oral use went, had only been able to speak it (if at all) with  members of their own national groups--that is, with compatriots who had  acquired the language under the same conditions as to pronunciation,  etc., as themselves. Experts and beginners, those who from practical  experience knew the great possibilities of the new tongue as a written  medium, no less than the neophytes and tentative experimenters who had  come to see whether the thing was worth taking seriously, they were now  to make the decisive trial--in the one case to test the faith that was  in them, in the other to set all doubt at rest in one sense or the other  for good and all.    The town theatre had been generously placed at the disposal of the  Congress, and the author of the language, Dr. Zamenhof, had left his  eye-patients at Warsaw and come to preside at the coming out of his  _kara lingvo_, now well on in her 'teens, and about to leave the  academic seclusion of scholastic use and emerge into the larger sphere  of social and practical activity.    On Saturday evening, August 5, at eight o'clock, the Boulogne Theatre  was packed with a cosmopolitan audience. The unique assembly was  pervaded by an indefinable feeling of expectancy; as in the lull before  the thunderstorm, there was the hush of excitement, the tense silence  charged with the premonition of some vast force about to be let loose  on the world. After a few preliminaries, there was a really dramatic  moment when Dr. Zamenhof stood up for the first time to address his  world-audience in the world-tongue. Would they understand him? Was their  hope about to be justified? or was it all a chimera, \"such stuff as  dreams are made on\"?    _Gesinjoroj_ (= Ladies and gentlemen)--the great audience  craned forward like one man, straining eyes and ears towards the  speaker,--_Kun granda plezuro mi akceptis la proponon..._ The  crowd drank in the words with an almost pathetic agony of anxiety.  Gradually, as the clear-cut sentences poured forth in a continuous  stream of perfect lucidity, and the audience realized that they were  all listening to and all understanding a really international speech  in a really international tongue--a tongue which secured to them, as  here in Boulogne so throughout the world, full comprehension and a  sense of comradeship and fellow-citizenship on equal terms with all  users of it--the anxiety gave way to a scene of wild enthusiasm. Men  shook hands with perfect strangers, and all cheered and cheered again.

(11)      The subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of  this kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:      1. ARTICULATION.           4. READING VERSE.  2. INFLECTION.             5. THE VOICE.  3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.    6. GESTURE.        I. ARTICULATION. (11)    Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and  of their combinations.    As words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the  student should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with  distinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by  careful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has  acquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.        ELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)    An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of  speech.    The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,  Subvocals, and Aspirates.        VOCALS. (12)    Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most  prominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first  receive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the  word hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a  union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is  usually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.    Each of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct  expression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the  moment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth,  tongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound  from the throat in the same manner that the syllable \"ah!\" is uttered in  endeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus,  a'--a'--a'--.    Let the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table  with all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do  it with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished  until he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the  suddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal  alone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound  other than the one intended.    At first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert;  then separately.        TABLE OF VOCALS. (13)    Long Sounds.    Sound   as in    a       hate  e       err  a       hare  i       pine  a       pass  o       no  a       far  oo      cool  a       fall  u       tube  e       eve  u       burn      Short Sounds.    Sound   as in    a       mat  o       hot  e       met  oo      book  i       it  u       us      Diphthongs.  oi, oy, as in oil, boy.  ou, ow, as in out, now.      REMARK I.--In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same,  in quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in  quality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.    REMARK II.--The vocals are often represented by other letters or  combinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is  represented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.    REMARK III.--As  a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should  be articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a  sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech  follows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from  carelessness with respect to the second.        SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)    Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less  obstructed.    Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.    Words ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the  subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for  practice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly,  several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the  subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and  elements, at first, in concert; then separately.        TABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES. (14)    Subvocals. as in    b          babe  d          bad  g          nag  j          judge  v          move  th         with  z          buzz  z          azure (azh-)  w          wine    Aspirates. as in    p          rap  t          at  k          book  ch         rich  f          life  th         smith  s          hiss  sh         rush  wh         what      REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognates. In  articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position  required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the  breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal  sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice  on these cognates.    The following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:    SUBVOCAL  as in    l         mill  ng        sing  m         rim  r         rule  n         run  y         yet        ASPIRATE.    h, as in hat.        SUBSTITUTES. (14)    Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented  by other characters.    TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

(15)    The most common faults of articulation are dropping an unaccented vowel,  sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel, suppressing final consonants,  omitting or mispronouncing syllables, and blending words.      1.
