In this way, every fault,  every deviation of the old translators must be apparent; the most  striking of them I have remarked on in the notes, but I have more  frequently amended such things silently, as a comparison will show the  reader.\" The translator has not compared his version with any English  version. The translation of North, which has great merit in point of  expression, is a version of Amyot's French version, from which, however,  it differs in some passages, where it is decidedly wrong and Amyot's  version is right. Indeed, it is surprising to find how correct this old  French translation generally is. The translation of 'Plutarch's Lives  from the Greek by several hands,' was published at London in 1683-86. It  was dedicated by Dryden to James Butler, the first Duke of Ormond, in a  fulsome panegyric. It is said that forty-one translators laboured at the  work. Dryden did not translate any of the Lives; but he wrote the Life  of Plutarch which is prefixed to this translation. The advertisement  prefixed to the translation passes under the name and character of the  bookseller (Jacob Tonson), but, as Malone observes, it may from internal  evidence be safely attributed to Dryden. The bookseller says, \"You have  here the first volume of Plutarch's Lives turned from the Greek into  English; and give me leave to say, the first attempt of doing it from  the _originals_.\" This is aimed at North's version, of which Dryden  remarks in his Life of Plutarch: \"As that translation was only from the  French, so it suffered this double disadvantage; first, that it was but  a copy of a copy, and that too but lamely taken from the Greek original;  secondly, that the English language was then unpolished, and far from  the perfection which it has since attained; so that the first version is  not only ungrammatical and ungraceful, but in many places almost  unintelligible.\" There is another English version, by the Langhornes,  which has often been reprinted; there is an edition of it with notes by  Wrangham. I have compared my translation carefully with the German of  Kaltwasser, and sometimes with the French of Amyot, and I have thus  avoided some errors into which I should have fallen. There are errors  both in the versions of Amyot and Kaltwasser which I have avoided; but I  may have fallen into others.    The translation of Kaltwasser contains some useful notes. Those which I  have added to this translation are intended to explain so much as needs  explanation to a person who is not much acquainted with Roman history  and Roman usages; but they will also be useful to others. The notes of  Kaltwasser have often reminded me of the passages where some note would  be useful, and have occasionally furnished materials also. But as I have  always referred to the original authorities, I do not consider it  necessary to make more than this general acknowledgment. The notes added  to this translation are all my own, and contain my own opinions and  observations.    This translation has been made from the edition of C. Sintenis, Leipzig,  1839, and I have compared the text of Sintenis with that of G.H.  Schaefer, Leipzig, 1826, which has been severely criticized: this  edition contains, however, some useful notes. I have very seldom made  any remarks on the Greek text, as such kind of remark would not have  suited the plan and design of this version, which is not intended for  verbal critics.    I shall explain by two brief extracts what is my main design in this  version and in the notes, which must be my apology for not affecting a  learned commentary, and my excuse to those who shall not find here the  kind of remarks that are suitable to a critical edition of an ancient  author. I have had another object than to discuss the niceties of words  and the forms of phrases, a labour which is well in its place, if it be  done well, but is not what needs to be done to such an author as  Plutarch to render him useful. A man who was a great reader of Plutarch,  a just and solid thinker above the measure of his age, and not surpassed  in his way by any writer in our own, Montaigne, observes in his 'Essay  of the Education of Children'--\"Let him enquire into the manners,  revenues, and alliances of princes, things in themselves very pleasant  to learn, and very useful to know. In this conversing with men, I mean,  and principally those who only live in the records of history, he shall  by reading those books, converse with those great and heroic souls of  former and better ages. 'Tis an idle and vain study, I confess, to those  who make it so, by doing it after a negligent manner, but to those who  do it with care and observation, 'tis a study of inestimable fruit and  value; and the only one, as Plato reports, the Lacedaemonians reserved  to themselves. What profit shall he not reap as to the business of men,  by reading the Lives of Plutarch? But withal, let my governor remember  to what end his instructions are principally directed, and that he do  not so much imprint in his pupil's memory the date of the ruin of  Carthage, as the manners of Hannibal and Scipio; not so much where  Marcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his duty that he died there.  That he do not teach him so much the narrative part, as the business of  history. The reading of which, in my opinion, is a thing that of all  others we apply ourselves unto with the most differing and uncertain  measures.\"[A] North, in his address to the Reader, says: \"The profit of  stories, and the praise of the Author, are sufficiently declared by  Amiot, in his Epistle to the Reader: so that I shall not need to make  many words thereof. And indeed if you will supply the defects of this  translation, with your own diligence and good understanding: you shall  not need to trust him, you may prove yourselves, that there is no  prophane study better than Plutarch. All other learning is private,  fitter for Universities than Cities, fuller of contemplation than  experience, more commendable in students themselves, than profitable  unto others. Whereas stories are fit for every place, reach to all  persons, serve for all times, teach the living, revive the dead, so far  excelling all other books, as it is better to see learning in Noblemen's  lives, than to read it in Philosophers' writings.\"    GEORGE LONG.

Plutarch was born probably between A.D. 45 and A.D. 50, at the little  town of Chaeronea in Boeotia. His family appears to have been long  established in this place, the scene of the final destruction of the  liberties of Greece, when Philip defeated the Athenians and Boeotian  forces there in 338 B.C. It was here also that Sulla defeated  Mithridates, and in the great civil wars of Rome we again hear, this  time from Plutarch himself, of the sufferings of the citizens of  Chaeronea. Nikarchus, Plutarch's great-grandfather, was, with all the  other citizens, without any exception, ordered by a lieutenant of Marcus  Antonius to transport a quantity of corn from Chaeronea to the coast  opposite the island of Antikyra. They were compelled to carry the corn  on their shoulders, like slaves, and were threatened with the lash if  they were remiss. After they had performed one journey, and were  preparing their burdens for a second, the welcome news arrived that  Marcus Antonius had lost the battle of Actium, whereupon both the  officers and soldiers of his party stationed in Chaeronea at once fled  for their own safety, and the provisions thus collected were divided  among the inhabitants of the city.    When Plutarch was born, however, no such warlike scenes as these were to  be expected. Nothing more than the traditions of war remained on the  shores of the Mediterranean. Occasionally some faint echo of strife  would make itself heard from the wild tribes on the Danube, or in the  far Syrian deserts, but over nearly all the world known to the ancients  was established the Pax Romana. Battles were indeed fought, and troops  were marched upon Rome, but this was merely to decide who was to be the  nominal head of the vast system of the Empire, and what had once been  independent cities, countries, and nations submitted unhesitatingly to  whoever represented that irresistible power. It might be imagined that a  political system which destroyed all national individuality, and  rendered patriotism in its highest sense scarcely possible, would have  reacted unfavourably on the literary character of the age. Yet nothing  of the kind can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#3)"],[1,"but, to  use the words of the artist himself, \"in these canvases the objects are  the decoration, the touches are the scales, and the light is the tenor.\"  Monticelli has created for himself an entirely personal technique which  can only be compared with that of Turner; he painted with a brush so  full, fat and rich, that some of the details are often truly modelled in  relief, in a substance as precious as enamels, jewels, ceramics--a  substance which is a delight in itself. Every picture by Monticelli  provokes astonishment; constructed upon one colour as upon a musical  theme, it rises to intensities which one would have thought impossible.  His pictures are magnificent bouquets, bursts of joy and colour, where  nothing is ever crude, and where everything is ruled by a supreme sense  of harmony.    [Illustration: MANET    THE READER]    Claude Lorrain, Watteau, Turner and Monticelli constitute really the  descent of a landscapist like Claude Monet. In all matters concerning  technique, they form the direct chain of Impressionism. As regards  design, subject, realism, the study of modern life, the conception of  beauty and the portrait, the Impressionist movement is based upon the  old French masters, principally upon Chardin, Watteau, Latour,  Largilliere, Fragonard, Debucourt, Saint-Aubin, Moreau, and Eisen. It  has resolutely held aloof from mythology, academic allegory, historical  painting, and from the neo-Greek elements of Classicism as well as from  the German and Spanish elements of Romanticism. This reactionary  movement is therefore entirely French, and surely if it deserves  reproach, the one least deserved is that levelled upon it by the  official painters: disobedience to the national spirit. Impressionism is  an art which does not give much scope to intellectuality, an art whose  followers admit scarcely anything but immediate vision, rejecting  philosophy and symbols and occupying themselves only with the  consideration of light, picturesqueness, keen and clever observation,  and antipathy to abstraction, as the innate qualities of French art. We  shall see later on, when considering separately its principal masters,  that each of them has based his art upon some masters of pure French  blood.    Impressionism has, then, hitherto been very badly judged. It is  contained in two chief points: search after a new technique, and  expression of modern reality. Its birth has not been a spontaneous  phenomenon. Manet, who, by his spirit and by the chance of his  friendships, grouped around him the principal members, commenced by  being classed in the ranks of the Realists of the second Romanticism by  the side of Courbet; and during the whole first period of his work he  only endeavoured to describe contemporary scenes, at a time when the  laws of the new technique were already dawning upon Claude Monet.  Gradually the grouping of the Impressionists took place. Claude Monet is  really the first initiator: in a parallel line with his ideas and his  works Manet passed into the second period of his artistic life, and with  him Renoir, Degas and Pissarro. But Manet had already during his first  period been the topic of far-echoing polemics, caused by his realism and  by the marked influence of the Spaniards and of Hals upon his style; his  temperament, too, was that of the head of a school; and for these  reasons legend has attached to his name the title of head of the  Impressionist school, but this legend is incorrect.    To conclude, the very name \"Impressionism\" is due to Claude Monet. There  has been much serious arguing upon this famous word which has given rise  to all sorts of definitions and conclusions. In reality this is its  curious origin which is little known, even in criticism. Ever since  1860 the works of Manet and of his friends caused such a stir, that they  were rejected _en bloc_ by the Salon jury of 1863. The emperor, inspired  by a praiseworthy, liberal thought, demanded that these innovators  should at least have the right to exhibit together in a special room  which was called the _Salon des Refuses_. The public crowded there to  have a good laugh. One of the pictures which caused most derision was a  sunset by Claude Monet, entitled _Impressions_. From this moment the  painters who adopted more or less the same manner were called  _Impressionists_. The word remained in use, and Manet and his friends  thought it a matter of indifference whether this label was attached to  them, or another. At this despised Salon were to be found the names of  Manet, Monet, Whistler, Bracquemont, Jongkind, Fantin-Latour, Renoir,  Legros, and many others who have since risen to fame. Universal ridicule  only fortified the friendships and resolutions of this group of men, and  from that time dates the definite foundation of the Impressionist  school. For thirty years it continued to produce without interruption  an enormous quantity of works under an accidental and inexact  denomination; to obey the creative instinct, without any other dogma  than the passionate observation of nature, without any other assistance  than individual sympathies, in the face of the disciplinary teaching of  the official school.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE DANCER AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S]          II    THE THEORY OF THE IMPRESSIONISTS--THE DIVISION OF TONES, COMPLEMENTARY  COLOURS, THE STUDY OF ATMOSPHERE--THE IDEAS OF THE IMPRESSIONISTS ON  SUBJECT-PICTURES, ON THE BEAUTY OF CHARACTER, ON MODERNITY, AND ON STYLE      It should be stated from the outset that there is nothing dogmatic about  this explanation of the Impressionist theories, and that it is not the  result of a preconceived plan. In art a system is not improvised. A  theory is slowly evolved, nearly always unknown to the author, from the  discoveries of his sincere instinct, and this theory can only be  formulated after years by criticism facing the works. Monet and Manet  have worked for a long time without ever thinking that theories would be  built upon their paintings. Yet a certain number of considerations will  strike the close observer, and I will put these considerations before  the reader, after reminding him that spontaneity and feeling are the  essentials of all art.    [Illustration: DEGAS    CARRIAGES AT THE RACES]    The Impressionist ideas may be summed up in the following manner:--    In nature no colour exists by itself. The colouring of the objects is a  pure illusion: the only creative source of colour is the sunlight which  envelopes all things, and reveals them, according to the hours, with  infinite modifications. The mystery of matter escapes us; we do not know  the exact moment when reality separates itself from unreality. All we  know is, that our vision has formed the habit of discerning in the  universe two notions: form and colour; but these two notions are  inseparable. Only artificially can we distinguish between outline and  colour: in nature the distinction does not exist. Light reveals the  forms, and, playing upon the different states of matter, the substance  of leaves, the grain of stones, the fluidity of air in deep layers,  gives them dissimilar colouring. If the light disappears, forms and  colours vanish together. We only see colours; everything has a colour,  and it is by the perception of the different colour surfaces striking  our eyes, that we conceive the forms, _i.e._ the outlines of these  colours.    The idea of distance, of perspective, of volume is given us by darker or  lighter colours: this idea is what is called in painting the sense of  values. A value is the degree of dark or light intensity, which permits  our eyes to comprehend that one object is further or nearer than  another. And as painting is not and cannot be the _imitation_ of nature,  but merely her artificial interpretation, since it only has at its  disposal two out of three dimensions, the values are the only means that  remain for expressing depth on a flat surface.    Colour is therefore the procreatrix of design. Or, colour being simply  the irradiation of light, it follows that all colour is composed of the  same elements as sunlight, namely the seven tones of the spectrum. It is  known, that these seven tones appear different owing to the unequal  speed of the waves of light. The tones of nature appear to us therefore  different, like those of the spectrum, and for the same reason. The  colours vary with the intensity of light. There is no colour peculiar  to any object, but only more or less rapid vibration of light upon its  surface. The speed depends, as is demonstrated by optics, on the degree  of the inclination of the rays which, according to their vertical or  oblique direction, give different light and colour.    The colours of the spectrum are thus recomposed in everything we see. It  is their relative proportion which makes new tones out of the seven  spectral tones. This leads immediately to some practical conclusions,  the first of which is, that what has formerly been called _local colour_  is an error: a leaf is not green, a tree-trunk is not brown, and,  according to the time of day, _i.e._ according to the greater or smaller  inclination of the rays (scientifically called the angle of incidence),  the green of the leaf and the brown of the tree are modified. What has  to be studied therefore in these objects, if one wishes to recall their  colour to the beholder of a picture, is the composition of the  atmosphere which separates them from the eye. This atmosphere is the  real subject of the picture, and whatever is represented upon it only  exists through its medium.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE GREEK DANCE--PASTEL.]    A second consequence of this analysis of light is, that shadow is not  absence of light, but light of _a different quality_ and of different  value. Shadow is not a part of the landscape, where light ceases, but  where it is subordinated to a light which appears to us more intense. In  the shadow the"]]]
