Let's have a look at the others.\"    He turned to the second window.    The raising of the two remaining seats occupied him until well into the  afternoon. That of the bedroom, like the first, was empty; but from the  second seat of his sitting-room he drew out something yielding and folded  and furred over an inch thick with dust. He carried the object into the  kitchen, and having swept it over a bucket, took a duster to it.    It was some sort of a large bag, of an ancient frieze-like material, and  when unfolded it occupied the greater part of the small kitchen floor. In  shape it was an irregular, a very irregular, triangle, and it had a  couple of wide flaps, with the remains of straps and buckles. The patch  that had been uppermost in the folding was of a faded yellowish brown;  but the rest of it was of shades of crimson that varied according to the  exposure of the parts of it.    \"Now whatever can that have been?\" Oleron mused as he stood surveying  it.... \"I give it up. Whatever it is, it's settled my work for today,  I'm afraid--\"    He folded the object up carelessly and thrust it into a corner of the  kitchen; then, taking pans and brushes and an old knife, he returned to  the sitting-room and began to scrape and to wash and to line with paper  his newly discovered receptacles. When he had finished, he put his spare  boots and books and papers into them; and he closed the lids again,  amused with his little adventure, but also a little anxious for the hour  to come when he should settle fairly down to his work again.      III    It piqued Oleron a little that his friend, Miss Bengough, should dismiss  with a glance the place he himself had found so singularly winning.  Indeed she scarcely lifted her eyes to it. But then she had always been  more or less like that--a little indifferent to the graces of life,  careless of appearances, and perhaps a shade more herself when she ate  biscuits from a paper bag than when she dined with greater observance of  the convenances. She was an unattached journalist of thirty-four, large,  showy, fair as butter, pink as a dog-rose, reminding one of a florist's  picked specimen bloom, and given to sudden and ample movements and moist  and explosive utterances. She \"pulled a better living out of the pool\"  (as she expressed it) than Oleron did; and by cunningly disguised puffs  of drapers and haberdashers she \"pulled\" also the greater part of her  very varied wardrobe. She left small whirlwinds of air behind her when  she moved, in which her veils and scarves fluttered and spun.    Oleron heard the flurry of her skirts on his staircase and her single  loud knock at his door when he had been a month in his new abode. Her  garments brought in the outer air, and she flung a bundle of ladies'  journals down on a chair.    \"Don't knock off for me,\" she said across a mouthful of large-headed  hatpins as she removed her hat and veil. \"I didn't know whether you were  straight yet, so I've brought some sandwiches for lunch. You've got  coffee, I suppose?--No, don't get up--I'll find the kitchen--\"    \"Oh, that's all right, I'll clear these things away. To tell the truth,  I'm rather glad to be interrupted,\" said Oleron.    He gathered his work together and put it away. She was already in the  kitchen; he heard the running of water into the kettle. He joined her,  and ten minutes later followed her back to the sitting-room with the  coffee and sandwiches on a tray. They sat down, with the tray on a small  table between them.    \"Well, what do you think of the new place?\" Oleron asked as she poured  out coffee.    \"Hm!... Anybody'd think you were going to get married, Paul.\"    He laughed.    \"Oh no. But it's an improvement on some of them, isn't it?\"    \"Is it? I suppose it is; I don't know. I liked the last place, in spite  of the black ceiling and no watertap. How's _Romilly_?\"    Oleron thumbed his chin.    \"Hm! I'm rather ashamed to tell you. The fact is, I've not got on very  well with it. But it will be all right on the night, as you used to say.\"    \"Stuck?\"    \"Rather stuck.\"    \"Got any of it you care to read to me?...\"    Oleron had long been in the habit of reading portions of his work to Miss  Bengough occasionally. Her comments were always quick and practical,  sometimes directly useful, sometimes indirectly suggestive. She, in  return for his confidence, always kept all mention of her own work  sedulously from him. His, she said, was \"real work\"; hers merely filled  space, not always even grammatically.    \"I'm afraid there isn't,\" Oleron replied, still meditatively dry-shaving  his chin. Then he added, with a little burst of candour, \"The fact  is, Elsie, I've not written--not actually written--very much more of  it--_any_ more of it, in fact. But, of course, that doesn't mean I  haven't progressed. I've progressed, in one sense, rather alarmingly.  I'm now thinking of reconstructing the whole thing.\"    Miss Bengough gave a gasp. \"Reconstructing!\"    \"Making Romilly herself a different type of woman. Somehow, I've begun to  feel that I'm not getting the most out of her. As she stands, I've  certainly lost interest in her to some extent.\"    \"But--but--\" Miss Bengough protested, \"you had her so real, so _living_,  Paul!\"    Oleron smiled faintly. He had been quite prepared for Miss Bengough's  disapproval. He wasn't surprised that she liked Romilly as she at present  existed; she would. Whether she realised it or not, there was much of  herself in his fictitious creation. Naturally Romilly would seem \"real,\"  \"living,\" to her....    \"But are you really serious, Paul?\" Miss Bengough asked presently, with a  round-eyed stare.    \"Quite serious.\"    \"You're really going to scrap those fifteen chapters?\"    \"I didn't exactly say that.\"    \"That fine, rich love-scene?\"    \"I should only do it reluctantly, and for the sake of something I thought  better.\"    \"And that beautiful, _beau_tiful description of Romilly on the shore?\"    \"It wouldn't necessarily be wasted,\" he said a little uneasily.    But Miss Bengough made a large and windy gesture, and then let him have  it.    \"Really, you are _too_ trying!\" she broke out. \"I do wish sometimes you'd  remember you're human, and live in a world! You know I'd be the _last_ to  wish you to lower your standard one inch, but it wouldn't be lowering it  to bring it within human comprehension. Oh, you're sometimes altogether  too godlike!... Why, it would be a wicked, criminal waste of your powers  to destroy those fifteen chapters! Look at it reasonably, now. You've  been working for nearly twenty years; you've now got what you've been  working for almost within your grasp; your affairs are at a most critical  stage (oh, don't tell me; I know you're about at the end of your money);  and here you are, deliberately proposing to withdraw a thing that will  probably make your name, and to substitute for it something that ten to  one nobody on earth will ever want to read--and small blame to them!  Really, you try my patience!\"    Oleron had shaken his head slowly as she had talked. It was an old story  between them. The noisy, able, practical journalist was an admirable  friend--up to a certain point; beyond that ... well, each of us knows  that point beyond which we stand alone. Elsie Bengough sometimes said  that had she had one-tenth part of Oleron's genius there were few things  she could not have done--thus making that genius a quantitatively  divisible thing, a sort of ingredient, to be added to or subtracted  from in the admixture of his work. That it was a qualitative thing,  essential, indivisible, informing, passed her comprehension. Their  spirits parted company at that point. Oleron knew it. She did not appear  to know it.    \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said a little wearily, by-and-by, \"practically you're  quite right, entirely right, and I haven't a word to say. If I could only  turn _Romilly_ over to you you'd make an enormous success of her. But  that can't be, and I, for my part, am seriously doubting whether she's  worth my while. You know what that means.\"    \"What does it mean?\" she demanded bluntly.    \"Well,\" he said, smiling wanly, \"what _does_ it mean when you're  convinced a thing isn't worth doing? You simply don't do it.\"    Miss Bengough's eyes swept the ceiling for assistance against this  impossible man.    \"What utter rubbish!\" she broke out at last. \"Why, when I saw you last  you were simply oozing _Romilly_; you were turning her off at the rate of  four chapters a week; if you hadn't moved you'd have had her three-parts  done by now. What on earth possessed you to move right in the middle of  your most important work?\"    Oleron tried to put her off with a recital of inconveniences, but she  wouldn't have it. Perhaps in her heart she partly suspected the reason.  He was simply mortally weary of the narrow circumstances of his life. He  had had twenty years of it--twenty years of garrets and roof-chambers  and dingy flats and shabby lodgings, and he was tired of dinginess and  shabbiness. The reward was as far off as ever--or if it was not, he no  longer cared as once he would have cared to put out his hand and take it.  It is all very well to tell a man who is at the point of exhaustion that  only another effort is required of him; if he cannot make it he is as far  off as ever....    \"Anyway,\" Oleron summed up, \"I'm happier here than I've been for a long  time. That's some sort of a justification.\"    \"And doing no work,\" said Miss Bengough pointedly.    At that a trifling petulance that had been gathering in Oleron came to a  head.    \"And why should I do nothing but work?\" he demanded. \"How much happier am  I for it? I don't say I don't love my work--when it's done; but I hate  doing it. Sometimes it's an intolerable burden that I simply long to be  rid of. Once in many weeks it has a moment, one moment, of glow and  thrill for me;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#3)"],[1,"great Mental Laws, instead of  using them in a haphazard manner. With the Master-Key in his possession,  the student may unlock the many doors of the mental and psychic temple  of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This  Principle explains the true nature of \"Energy,\" \"Power,\" and \"Matter,\"  and why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind. One of  the old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: \"He who grasps the truth  of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to  Mastery.\" And these words are as true today as at the time they were  first written. Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the  student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.    2.  The Principle of Correspondence        \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"--The Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence  between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life.  The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as  below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means  of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are  planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of  Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would  otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal  application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material,  mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient  Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental  instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid  from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the  extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just  as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure  distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory,  so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence enables Man to reason  intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he  understands the archangel.    3.  The Principle of Vibration        \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"--The      Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\";  \"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science  endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And  yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by  the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the  differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,  and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From  THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all  is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in  the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of  intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly  moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale,  there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem  at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of  varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and  molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.  This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but  varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose  states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes.  An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas,  enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well  as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the  conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \"He who understands  the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power,\" says one  of the old writers.    4.  The Principle of Polarity        \"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its      pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are      identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;      all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be      reconciled.\"--The Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything  has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which  were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have  perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and  antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites  are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be  reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same  time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\";  \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. It explains that  in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that  \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with  many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold,  although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences  consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer  and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins!  There is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two  terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same  thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\"  is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So \"heat\" and \"cold\"  are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the  phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of  Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and  Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of  varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does  \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between  \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"?  Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and  Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity  explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The  same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us take a radical and  extreme example--that of \"Love and Hate,\" two mental states apparently  totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of  Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms \"Like or Dislike,\"  which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss  to know whether we \"like\" or \"dislike\" or \"neither.\" And all are simply  degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a  moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance  by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to  the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others.  Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the  involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your  own case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the  possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by means  of the Hermetic formulas. \"Good and Evil\" are but the poles of the same  thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into  Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,  the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and  practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding  of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as  that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master  the art.    5.  The Principle of Rhythm        \"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;      all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in      everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the      measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"--The      Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested  a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and  forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide  and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the  Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action  and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This  is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,  energy, and matter.  This law is manifest in the creation and  destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of  all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this  latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most  important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its  universal application, and have also discovered certain means to  overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate  formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They  cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they  have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain  degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned  how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar  methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics  polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then  neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry  him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of  Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously,  but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and  attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of  belief on the part of the masses"]]]
