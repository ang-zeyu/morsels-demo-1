He soon found that, though all  pretended to have seen lights and heard noises, and so forth, the weight  of the evidence lay upon the statement of one of his own mates, an  Irishman and a Catholic, which might increase his tendency to  superstition, but in other respects a veracious, honest, and sensible  person, whom Captain ----had no reason to suspect would wilfully deceive  him. He affirmed to Captain S---- with the deepest obtestations, that  the spectre of the murdered man appeared to him almost nightly, took him  from his place in the vessel, and, according to his own expression,  worried his life out. He made these communications with a degree of  horror which intimated the reality of his distress and apprehensions.  The captain, without any argument at the time, privately resolved to  watch the motions of the ghost-seer in the night; whether alone, or with  a witness, I have forgotten. As the ship bell struck twelve, the sleeper  started up, with a ghastly and disturbed countenance, and lighting a  candle, proceeded to the galley or cook-room of the vessel. He sate down  with his eyes open, staring before him as on some terrible object which  he beheld with horror, yet from which he could not withhold his eyes.  After a short space he arose, took up a tin can or decanter, filled it  with water, muttering to himself all the while--mixed salt in the water,  and sprinkled it about the galley. Finally, he sighed deeply, like one  relieved from a heavy burden, and, returning to his hammock, slept  soundly. In the next morning the haunted man told the usual precise  story of his apparition, with the additional circumstances, that the  ghost had led him to the galley, but that he had fortunately, he knew  not how, obtained possession of some holy water, and succeeded in  getting rid of his unwelcome visitor. The visionary was then informed of  the real transactions of the night, with so many particulars as to  satisfy him he had been the dupe of his imagination; he acquiesced in  his commander's reasoning, and the dream, as often happens in these  cases, returned no more after its imposture had been detected. In this  case, we find the excited imagination acting upon the half-waking  senses, which were intelligent enough for the purpose of making him  sensible where he was, but not sufficiently so to judge truly of the  objects before him.    But it is not only private life alone, or that tenor of thought which  has been depressed into melancholy by gloomy anticipations respecting  the future, which disposes the mind to mid-day fantasies, or to nightly  apparitions--a state of eager anxiety, or excited exertion, is equally  favourable to the indulgence of such supernatural communications. The  anticipation of a dubious battle, with all the doubt and uncertainty of  its event, and the conviction that it must involve his own fate and that  of his country, was powerful enough to conjure up to the anxious eye of  Brutus the spectre of his murdered friend Caesar, respecting whose death  he perhaps thought himself less justified than at the Ides of March,  since, instead of having achieved the freedom of Rome, the event had  only been the renewal of civil wars, and the issue might appear most  likely to conclude in the total subjection of liberty. It is not  miraculous that the masculine spirit of Marcus Brutus, surrounded by  darkness and solitude, distracted probably by recollection of the  kindness and favour of the great individual whom he had put to death to  avenge the wrongs of his country, though by the slaughter of his own  friend, should at length place before his eyes in person the appearance  which termed itself his evil genius, and promised again to meet him at  Philippi. Brutus' own intentions, and his knowledge of the military art,  had probably long since assured him that the decision of the civil war  must take place at or near that place; and, allowing that his own  imagination supplied that part of his dialogue with the spectre, there  is nothing else which might not be fashioned in a vivid dream or a  waking reverie, approaching, in absorbing and engrossing character, the  usual matter of which dreams consist. That Brutus, well acquainted with  the opinions of the Platonists, should be disposed to receive without  doubt the idea that he had seen a real apparition, and was not likely to  scrutinize very minutely the supposed vision, may be naturally  conceived; and it is also natural to think, that although no one saw the  figure but himself, his contemporaries were little disposed to examine  the testimony of a man so eminent, by the strict rules of  cross-examination and conflicting evidence, which they might have  thought applicable to another person, and a less dignified occasion.    Even in the field of death, and amid the mortal tug of combat itself,  strong belief has wrought the same wonder, which we have hitherto  mentioned as occurring in solitude and amid darkness; and those who were  themselves on the verge of the world of spirits, or employed in  dispatching others to these gloomy regions, conceived they beheld the  apparitions of those beings whom their national mythology associated  with such scenes. In such moments of undecided battle, amid the  violence, hurry, and confusion of ideas incident to the situation, the  ancients supposed that they saw their deities, Castor and Pollux,  fighting in the van for their encouragement; the heathen Scandinavian  beheld the Choosers of the slain; and the Catholics were no less easily  led to recognize the warlike Saint George or Saint James in the very  front of the strife, showing them the way to conquest. Such apparitions  being generally visible to a multitude, have in all times been supported  by the greatest strength of testimony. When the common feeling of  danger, and the animating burst of enthusiasm, act on the feelings of  many men at once, their minds hold a natural correspondence with each  other, as it is said is the case with stringed instruments tuned to the  same pitch, of which, when one is played, the chords of the others are  supposed to vibrate in unison with the tones produced. If an artful or  enthusiastic individual exclaims, in the heat of action, that he  perceives an apparition of the romantic kind which has been intimated,  his companions catch at the idea with emulation, and most are willing to  sacrifice the conviction of their own senses, rather than allow that  they did not witness the same favourable emblem, from which all draw  confidence and hope. One warrior catches the idea from another; all are  alike eager to acknowledge the present miracle, and the battle is won  before the mistake is discovered. In such cases, the number of persons  present, which would otherwise lead to detection of the fallacy, becomes  the means of strengthening it.    Of this disposition, to see as much of the supernatural as is seen by  others around, or, in other words, to trust to the eyes of others rather  than to our own, we may take the liberty to quote two remarkable  instances.    The first is from the \"Historia Verdadera\" of Don Bernal Dias del  Castillo, one of the companions of the celebrated Cortez in his Mexican  conquest. After having given an account of a great victory over extreme  odds, he mentions the report inserted in the contemporary Chronicle of  Gomara, that Saint Iago had appeared on a white horse in van of the  combat, and led on his beloved Spaniards to victory. It is very curious  to observe the Castilian cavalier's internal conviction that the rumour  arose out of a mistake, the cause of which he explains from his own  observation; whilst, at the same time, he does not venture to disown the  miracle. The honest Conquestador owns that he himself did not see this  animating vision; nay, that he beheld an individual cavalier, named  Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut horse, and fighting  strenuously in the very place where Saint James is said to have  appeared. But instead of proceeding to draw the necessary inference, the  devout Conquestador exclaims--\"Sinner that I am, what am I that I should  have beheld the blessed apostle!\"    The other instance of the infectious character of superstition occurs in  a Scottish book, and there can be little doubt that it refers, in its  first origin, to some uncommon appearance of the aurora borealis, or the  northern lights, which do not appear to have been seen in Scotland so  frequently as to be accounted a common and familiar atmospherical  phenomenon, until the beginning of the eighteenth century. The passage  is striking and curious, for the narrator, Peter Walker, though an  enthusiast, was a man of credit, and does not even affect to have seen  the wonders, the reality of which he unscrupulously adopts on the  testimony of others, to whose eyes he trusted rather than to his own.  The conversion of the sceptical gentleman of whom he speaks is highly  illustrative of popular credulity carried away into enthusiasm, or into  imposture, by the evidence of those around, and at once shows the  imperfection of such a general testimony, and the ease with which it is  procured, since the general excitement of the moment impels even the  more cold-blooded and judicious persons present to catch up the ideas  and echo the exclamations of the majority, who, from the first, had  considered the heavenly phenomenon as a supernatural weapon-schaw, held  for the purpose of a sign and warning of civil wars to come.    \"In the year 1686, in the months of June and July,\" says the honest  chronicler, \"many yet alive can witness that about the Crossford Boat,  two miles beneath Lanark, especially at the Mains, on the water of  Clyde, many people gathered together for several afternoons, where there  were showers of bonnets, hats, guns, and swords, which covered the trees  and the ground; companies of men in arms marching in order upon the  waterside; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#3)"],[1,"aliquid novi.\"    In the last week of the old year we started on our journey to Kimberley,  then a matter of thirty-six hours. The whole of one day we dawdled over  the Great Karroo in pelting rain and mist, which reminded one of  Scotland. This sandy desert was at that season covered with brown scrub,  for it was yet too early for the rains to have made it green, and the  only signs of life were a few ostriches, wild white goats, and, very  rarely, a waggon piled with wood, drawn along the sandy road by ten or  twelve donkeys. As to vegetation, there were huge clumps of  mimosa-bushes, just shedding their yellow blossoms, through which the  branches showed up with their long white thorns, giving them a weird and  withered appearance. It must indeed have required great courage on  behalf of the old Voor-trekker Boers, when they and their families left  Cape Colony, at the time of the Great Trek, in long lines of  white-tented waggons, to have penetrated through that dreary-waste in  search of the promised land, of green veldt and running streams, which  they had heard of, as lying away to the north, and eventually found in  the Transvaal. I have been told that President Kruger was on this  historical trek, a Voor-looper, or little boy who guides the leading  oxen.    Round Kimberley the country presented a very different appearance, and  here we saw the real veldt covered with short grass, just beginning to  get burnt up by the summer's heat. Our host, Mr. J. B. Currey, a name  well known in Diamond-Field circles, met us at the station. This is a  good old South African custom, and always seems to me to be the acme of  welcoming hospitality, and the climax to the kindness of inviting people  to stay, merely on the recommendation of friends--quite a common  occurrence in the colonies, and one which, I think, is never  sufficiently appreciated, the entertainers themselves thinking it so  natural a proceeding.    Kimberley itself and the diamond industry have both been so often and so  well described that I shall beware of saying much of either, and I will  only note a few things I remarked about this town, once humming with  speculation, business, and movement, but now the essence of a sleepy  respectability and visible prosperity. For the uninitiated it is better  to state that the cause of this change was the gradual amalgamation of  the diamond-mines and conflicting interests, which was absolutely  necessary to limit the output of diamonds. As a result the stranger soon  perceives that the whole community revolves on one axis, and is centred,  so to speak, in one authority. \"De Beers\" is the moving spirit, the  generous employer, and the universal benefactor. At that time there were  7,000 men employed in the mines, white and black, the skilled mechanics  receiving as much as L6 a week. Evidence of the generosity of this  company was seen in the model village built for the white workmen; in  the orchard containing 7,000 fruit-trees, then one of Mr. Rhodes's  favourite hobbies; and in the stud-farm for improving the breed of  horses in South Africa. If I asked the profession of any of the smart  young men who frequented the house where we were staying, for games of  croquet, it amused me always to receive the same answer, \"He is  something in De Beers.\" The town itself boasts of many commodious public  buildings, a great number of churches of all denominations, an excellent  and well-known club; but whatever the edifice, the roofing is always  corrugated iron, imported, I was told, from Wolverhampton. This roofing,  indeed, prevails over the whole of new South Africa; and although it  appears a very unsuitable protection from the burning rays of the  African sun, no doubt its comparative cheapness and the quickness of its  erection are the reasons why this style was introduced, and has been  adhered to. By dint of superhuman efforts, in spite of locust-plagues,  drought, and heavy thunderstorms, the inhabitants have contrived to  surround their little one-storied villas with gardens bright with  flowers, many creepers of vivid hues covering all the trellis-work of  the verandahs.    The interest of Kimberley, however, soon paled and waned as the  all-engrossing events of the Uitlander rebellion in Johannesburg rapidly  succeeded each other. One sultry evening our host brought us news of  tangible trouble on the Rand: some ladies who were about to leave for  that locality had received wires to defer their departure. Instantly, I  recollect, my thoughts flew back to the _Tantallon Castle_ and the dark  words we had heard whispered, so it was not as much of a surprise to me  as to the residents at Kimberley; to them it came as a perfect  bombshell, so well had the secret been kept. The next day the text of  the Manifesto, issued by Mr. Leonard, a lawyer, in the name of the  Uitlanders, to protest against their grievances, appeared in all the  morning papers, and its eloquent language aroused the greatest  enthusiasm in the town. Thus was the gauntlet thrown down with a  vengeance, and an ominous chord was struck by the statement, also in the  papers, that Mr. Leonard had immediately left for Cape Town, \"lest he  should be arrested.\" It must be remembered that any barrister, English  or Afrikander, holding an official position in the Transvaal, had at  that time to take the oath of allegiance to the Boer Government before  being free to practise his calling. The explanation of the exceedingly  acute feeling at Kimberley in those anxious days lay in the fact that  nearly everyone had relations or friends in the Golden City. Our hosts  themselves had two sons pursuing their professions there, and, of  course, in the event of trouble with England, these young men would have  been commandeered to fight for the Boer Government they served. One  possibility, however, I noticed, was never entertained--viz., that, if  fighting occurred, the English community might get the worst of it. Such  a contingency was literally laughed to scorn. \"The Boers were unprepared  and lazy; they took weeks to mobilize; they had given up shooting game,  hence their marksmen had deteriorated; and 200 men ought to be able to  take possession of Johannesburg and Kruger into the bargain.\" This was  what one heard on all sides, and in view of more recent events it is  rather significant; but I remember then the thought flashed across my  mind that these possible foes were the sons of the men who had  annihilated us at Majuba and Laing's Nek, and I wondered whether another  black page were going to be added to the country's history.    The next day, December 29, Kruger was reported in the papers to be  listening to reason; but this hopeful news was short-lived, for on  Monday, the 30th--as usual, a fiercely hot day--we received the  astounding intelligence that Dr. Jameson, administrator of Mashonaland  and Matabeleland, had entered the Transvaal at the head of the Chartered  Company's Police, 600 strong, with several Maxim and Gardner guns. No  upheaval of Nature could have created greater amazement, combined with a  good deal of admiration and some dismay, than this sensational news. The  dismay, indeed, increased as the facts were more fully examined. Nearly  all the officers of the corps held Imperial commissions, and one heard  perfect strangers asking each other how these officers could justify  their action of entering a friendly territory, armed to the teeth; while  the fact of Dr. Jameson himself being at their head heightened the  intense interest. I did not know that gentleman then, but I must say he  occupied in the hearts of the people at Kimberley, and, indeed, of the  whole country, quite a unique position.    It was in the diamond-fields he had worked as a young doctor, usurping  gradually almost the entire medical practice by his great skill as well  as by his charm of manner. Then, as Mr. Rhodes's nominee, he had  dramatically abandoned medicine and surgery, and had gone to the great  unknown Northern Territory almost at a moment's notice. He had obtained  concessions from the black tyrant, Lobengula, when all other emissaries  had failed; backwards and forwards many times across the vast stretch of  country between Bulawayo and Kimberley he had carried on negotiations  which had finally culminated, five years previously, in his leading a  column of 500 hardy pioneers to the promising country of Mashonaland,  which up to that time had lain in darkness under the cruel rule of the  dusky monarch. During three strenuous years Dr. Jameson, with no  military or legal education, had laboured to establish the nucleus of a  civilized government in that remote country; and during the first part  of that period the nearest point of civilization, from whence they could  derive their supplies, was Kimberley, a thousand miles away, across a  practically trackless country. Added to this difficulty, the  administrator found himself confronted with the wants and rights of the  different mining communities into which the pioneers had gradually split  themselves up, and which were being daily augmented by the arrival of  \"wasters\" and others, who had begun to filter in as the country was  written about, and its great mining and agricultural possibilities  enlarged upon. Finally, goaded thereto and justified therein by  Lobengula's continued cruelties, his raids on the defenceless Mashonas,  and his threats to the English, Dr. Jameson had led another expedition  against the King himself in his stronghold of Bulawayo. On that occasion  sharp fighting ensued, but he at length brought peace, and the dawning  of a new era to a vast native population in the country, which, with  Mashonaland, was to be known as Rhodesia. In fact, up to then his luck  had been almost supernatural and his achievements simply colossal. Added  to all this was his capacity for attaching people to himself, and his  absolutely fearless disposition; so it is easy to"]]]
