[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14667"],[0,"A Christmas Garland (#3)"],[1,"approach of autumn.  The yellowing leaves of the lime trees, the creeper that flushed to  so deep a crimson against the old grey walls, the chrysanthemums that  shed so prodigally their petals on the smooth green lawn--all these  things, beautiful and wonderful though they were, were somehow a  little melancholy also, as being signs of the year's decay. Once, when  he was fourteen or fifteen years old, he had overheard a friend of  the family say to his father \"How the days are drawing in!\"--a remark  which set him thinking deeply, with an almost morbid abandonment to  gloom, for quite a long time. He had not then grasped the truth that  in exactly the proportion in which the days draw in they will, in  the fullness of time, draw out. This was a lesson that he mastered in  later years. And, though the waning of summer never failed to touch  him with the sense of an almost personal loss, yet it seemed to him a  right thing, a wise ordination, that there should be these recurring  changes. Those men and women of whom the poet tells us that they lived  in \"a land where it was always afternoon\"--could they, Percy often  wondered, have felt quite that thankfulness which on a fine afternoon  is felt by us dwellers in ordinary climes? Ah, no! Surely it is  because we are made acquainted with the grey sadness of twilight, the  solemn majesty of the night-time, the faint chill of the dawn, that  we set so high a value on the more meridional hours. If there were no  autumn, no winter, then spring and summer would lose, not all indeed,  yet an appreciable part of their sweet savour for us. Thus, as his  mind matured, Percy came to be very glad of the gradual changes of the  year. He found in them a rhythm, as he once described it in his diary;  and this he liked very much indeed. He was aware that in his own  character, with its tendency to waywardness, to caprice, to disorder,  there was an almost grievous lack of this _rhythmic_ quality. In the  sure and seemly progression of the months, was there not for him a  desirable exemplar, a needed corrective? He was so liable to moods in  which he rebelled against the performance of some quite simple duty,  some appointed task--moods in which he said to himself \"H-ng it! I  will not do this,\" or \"Oh, b-th-r! I shall not do that!\" But it was  clear that Nature herself never spoke thus. Even as a passenger in  a frail barque on the troublous ocean will keep his eyes directed  towards some upstanding rock on the far horizon, finding thus inwardly  for himself, or hoping to find, a more stable equilibrium, a deeper  tranquillity, than is his, so did Percy daily devote a certain portion  of his time to quiet communion with the almanac.    There were times when he was sorely tempted to regret a little that  some of the feasts of the Church were \"moveable.\" True, they moved  only within strictly prescribed limits, and in accordance with certain  unalterable, wholly justifiable rules. Yet, in the very fact that  they did move, there seemed--to use an expressive slang phrase of the  day--\"something not quite nice.\" It was therefore the fixed feasts  that pleased Percy best, and on Christmas Day, especially, he  experienced a temperate glow which would have perhaps surprised those  who knew him only slightly.    By reason of the athletic exercises of his earlier years, Percy had  retained in middle life a certain lightness and firmness of tread;  and this on Christmas morning, between his rooms and the Cathedral,  was always so peculiarly elastic that he might almost have seemed to  be rather running than walking. The ancient fane, with its soarings  of grey columns to the dimness of its embowed roof, the delicate  traceries of the organ screen, the swelling notes of the organ, the  mellow shafts of light filtered through the stained-glass windows  whose hues were as those of emeralds and rubies and amethysts, the  stainless purity of the surplices of clergy and choir, the sober  richness of Sunday bonnets in the transept, the faint yet heavy  fragrance exhaled from the hot-water pipes--all these familiar things,  appealing, as he sometimes felt, almost too strongly to that sensuous  side of his nature which made him so susceptible to the paintings of  Mr. Leader, of Sir Luke Fildes, were on Christmas morning more than  usually affecting by reason of that note of quiet joyousness, of peace  and good will, that pervaded the lessons of the day, the collect, the  hymns, the sermon.    It was this spiritual aspect of Christmas that Percy felt to be  hardly sufficiently regarded, or at least dwelt on, nowadays, and he  sometimes wondered whether the modern Christmas had not been in some  degree inspired and informed by Charles Dickens. He had for that  writer a very sincere admiration, though he was inclined to think that  his true excellence lay not so much in faithful portrayal of the life  of his times, or in gift of sustained narration, or in those scenes of  pathos which have moved so many hearts in so many quiet homes, as in  the power of inventing highly fantastic figures, such as Mr. Micawber  or Mr. Pickwick. This view Percy knew to be somewhat heretical, and,  constitutionally averse from the danger of being suspected of \"talking  for effect,\" he kept it to himself; but, had anyone challenged him to  give his opinion, it was thus that he would have expressed himself.  In regard to Christmas, he could not help wishing that Charles Dickens  had laid more stress on its spiritual element. It was right that the  feast should be an occasion for good cheer, for the savoury meats, the  steaming bowl, the blazing log, the traditional games. But was not  the modern world, with its almost avowed bias towards materialism, too  little apt to think of Christmas as also a time for meditation, for  taking stock, as it were, of the things of the soul? Percy had heard  that in London nowadays there was a class of people who sate down  to their Christmas dinners in public hotels. He did not condemn this  practice. He never condemned a thing, but wondered, rather, whether  it were right, and could not help feeling that somehow it was not.  In the course of his rare visits to London he had more than once  been inside of one of the large new hotels that had sprung up--these  \"great caravanseries,\" as he described them in a letter to an  old school-fellow who had been engaged for many years in Chinese  mission work. And it seemed to him that the true spirit of Christmas  could hardly be acclimatised in such places, but found its proper  resting-place in quiet, detached homes, where were gathered together  only those connected with one another by ties of kinship, or of long  and tested friendship.    He sometimes blamed himself for having tended more and more, as the  quiet, peaceful, tranquil years went by, to absent himself from even  those small domestic gatherings. And yet, might it not be that his  instinct for solitude at this season was a right instinct, at least  for him, and that to run counter to it would be in some degree  unacceptable to the Power that fashioned us? Thus he allowed himself  to go, as it were, his own way. After morning service, he sate down  to his Christmas fare alone, and then, when the simple meal was over,  would sit and think in his accustomed chair, falling perhaps into  one of those quiet dozes from which, because they seemed to be so  natural a result, so seemly a consummation, of his thoughts, he  did not regularly abstain. Later, he sallied forth, with a sense  of refreshment, for a brisk walk among the fens, the sedges, the  hedgerows, the reed-fringed pools, the pollard willows that would in  due course be putting forth their tender shoots of palest green. And  then, once more in his rooms, with the curtains drawn and the candles  lit, he would turn to his book-shelves and choose from among them some  old book that he knew and loved, or maybe some quite new book by that  writer whose works were most dear to him because in them he seemed  always to know so precisely what the author would say next, and  because he found in their fine-spun repetitions a singular repose,  a sense of security, an earnest of calm and continuity, as though he  were reading over again one of those wise copy-books that he had so  loved in boyhood, or were listening to the sounds made on a piano by  some modest, very conscientious young girl with a pale red pig-tail,  practising her scales, very gently, hour after hour, next door.          PERKINS AND MANKIND    _By_    H.G. W*LLS      Chapter XX      Sec.1.    It was the Christmas party at Heighton that was one of the  turning-points in Perkins' life. The Duchess had sent him a three-page  wire in the hyperbolical style of her class, conveying a vague  impression that she and the Duke had arranged to commit suicide  together if Perkins didn't \"chuck\" any previous engagement he had  made. And Perkins had felt in a slipshod sort of way--for at this  period he was incapable of ordered thought--he might as well be at  Heighton as anywhere....    The enormous house was almost full. There must have been upwards of  fifty people sitting down to every meal. Many of these were members of  the family. Perkins was able to recognise them by their unconvoluted  ears--the well-known Grifford ear, transmitted from one generation to  another. For the rest there were the usual lot from the Front Benches  and the Embassies. Evesham was there, clutching at the lapels of his  coat; and the Prescotts--he with his massive mask of a face, and she  with her quick, hawk-like ways, talking about two things at a time;  old Tommy Strickland, with his monocle and his dropped g's, telling  you what he had once said to Mr. Disraeli; Boubou Seaforth and his  American wife; John Pirram, ardent and elegant, spouting old French  lyrics; and a score of others.    Perkins had got used to them by now.

[Illustration: Older girls playing with younger girl. Three children  standing in background.]    2. Her grandfather first gave her this name, and it seemed to fit the  little girl so nicely that soon it took the place of her own.    3. Even when a baby, Susie laughed and crowed from morning till night. No  one ever heard her cry unless she was sick or hurt.    4. When she had learned to walk, she loved to go about the house and get  things for her mother, and in this way save her as many steps as she  could.    5. She would sit by her mother's side for an hour at a time, and ask her  ever so many questions, or she would take her new book and read.    6. Susie was always pleasant in her play with other children. She never  used an unkind word, but tried to do whatever would please her playmates  best.    7. One day, a poor little girl with a very ragged dress was going by and  Susie heard some children teasing her and making fun of her.    8. She at once ran out to the gate, and asked the poor little girl to come  in. \"What are you crying for?\" Susie asked.    9. \"Because they all laugh at me,\" she said.    10. Then Susie took the little girl into the house. She cheered her up  with kind words, and gave her a nice dress and a pair of shoes.    11. This brought real joy and gladness to the poor child, and she, too,  thought that Susie was rightly called Sunbeam.

I would steal among them,       Softest light I'd shed,     Until every lily       Raised its drooping head.    2. \"If I were a sunbeam,       I know where I'd go;     Into lowly hovels,       Dark with want and woe:     Till sad hearts looked upward,       I would shine and shine;     Then they'd think of heaven,       Their sweet home and mine.\"    3.

Henry was a kind, good boy. His father was dead, and his mother was  very poor. He had a little sister about two years old.    2. He wanted to help his mother, for she could not always earn enough to  buy food for her little family.    3. One day, a man gave him a dollar for finding a pocketbook which he had  lost.    4. Henry might have kept all the money, for no one saw him when he found  it. But his mother had taught him to be honest, and never to keep what did  not belong, to him.    5. With the dollar he bought a box, three brushes, and some blacking. He  then went to the corner of the street, and said to every one whose boots  did not look nice, \"Black your boots, sir, please?\"    6. He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to let  him black their boots. The first day he brought home fifty cents, which he  gave to his mother to buy food with.    7. When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of joy,  \"You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn enough  to buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along quite well,\"    8. Henry worked all the day, and went to school in the evening. He earned  almost enough to support his mother and his little sister.        LESSON XV.    tread     whis'per     soft'ly     talk     cheer ful'     care'ful      DON'T WAKE THE BABY.

A boy was once sent from home to take a basket of things to his  grandmother.    2. The basket was so full that it was very heavy. So his little brother  went with him, to help carry the load.    3. They put a pole under the handle of the basket, and each then took hold  of an end of the pole. In this way they could carry the basket very  nicely.    4. Now the older boy thought, \"My brother Tom does not know about this  pole.    5. \"If I slip the basket near him, his side will be heavy, and mine light;  but if the basket is in the middle of the pole, it will be as heavy for me  as it is for him.    6. \"Tom does not know this as I do. But I will not do it. It would be  wrong, and I will not do what is wrong.\"    7. Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole. His load  was now heavier than that of his little brother.    8. Yet he was happy; for he felt that he had done right. Had he deceived  his brother, he would not have felt at all happy.

The kingbird is not bigger than a robin.    2. He eats flies, and worms, and bugs, and berries.    3. He builds his nest in a tree, near some house.    4. When there are young ones in the nest, he sits on the top of a tree  near them.    5. He watches to see that no bird comes to hurt them or their mother.    6. If a hawk, a crow, or even an eagle comes near, he makes a dash at it.    7. Though he is so small, he is brave, and he is also very active.    8. He never fails to drive off other birds from his nest.    9. He flies around and around the eagle, and suddenly strikes him with his  sharp bill.    10. He strikes at his eye, and then darts away before the eagle can catch  him.    11. Or he strikes from behind, and is off again before the eagle can turn  round.    12. In a short time, the great eagle is tired of such hard blows, and  flies away. He is very glad to get rid of his foe.    13. Is not the little fellow a brave bird?    14. Because he can drive off all other birds, he is called the KINGBIRD.

Under a great tree in the woods, two boys saw a fine, large nut, and  both ran to get it.    2. James got to it first, and picked it up.    3. \"It is mine,\" said John, \"for I was the first to see it.\"    4. \"No, it is mine\" said James, \"for I was the first to pick it up.\"    [Illustration: Three boys standing by a fence, one older than the others.]    5. Thus, they at once began to quarrel about the nut.    6. As they could not agree whose it should be, they called an older boy,  and asked him.    7. The older boy said, \"I will settle this quarrel.\"    8. He took the nut, and broke the shell. He then took out the kernel, and  divided the shell into two parts, as nearly equal as he could.    9. \"This half of the shell,\" said he, \"belongs to the boy who first saw  the nut.    10. \"And this half belongs to the boy who picked it up.    11. \"The kernel of the nut, I shall keep as my pay for settling the  quarrel.    12. \"This is the way,\" said he, laughing, \"in which quarrels are very apt  to end.\"        LESSON XXI.    crea'tures    drones     in'side    hive     i'dle    de fense'     driv'en    killed     cells    size    work'ers      queen      stings     shape    wax      THE BEE.    1.
