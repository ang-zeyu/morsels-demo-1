In all to the value of near fifty Pounds.    The _Sunday_ following, being the 19th of _July, Sheppard_ and  _Blewskins_ were out upon the _Hampstead_ Road, and there stopt a Coach  with a Ladies Woman in it, from whom they took but Half-a-Crown; all the  Money then about her; the Foot-man behind the Coach came down, and  exerted himself; but _Sheppard_ sent him in hast up to his Post again,  by threat of his Pistol.    The next Night being the 20th of _july_, about Nine, they Robb'd Mr.  _Pargiter_, a Chandler of _Hamstead_, near the Halfway-House;  _Sheppard_ after his being taken at _Finchley_ was particularly  examin'd about this Robbery. The Reverend Mr. _Wagstaff_ having receiv'd  a Letter from an unknown Hand, with two Questions, to be propos'd to  _Sheppard_, _viz._ Whether he did Rob _John Pargiter_, on _Monday_ the  20th of _July_, about Nine at Night, between the _Turnpike_ and  _Hamstead_; How much Money he took from him? Whither _Pargiter_ was  Drunk, or not, and if he had Rings or Watch about him, when robb'd?  which, Request was comply'd with, and _Sheppard_ affirm'd, that Mr.  _Pargiter_ was very much in Liquor, having a great Coat on; neither  Rings on his Fingers or Watch, and only three Shillings in his Pocket,  which they took from him, and that _Blewskins_ knock him down twice with  the Butt-end of his Pistol to make sure Work, (tho' Excess of drink had  done that before) but _Sheppard_ did in kindness raise him up as often.    The next Night, _July_ 21, they stopt a Stage-Coach, and took from a  Passenger in it, Twenty-two Shillings, and were so expeditious in the  Matter, that _not two Words were made about the Bargain_.    Now Mr. _Sheppard's_ long and wicked Course seemingly draws towards a  Period. Mr. _Kneebone_ having apply'd to _Jonathan Wild_, and set forth  Advertisements in the Papers, complaining of his Robbery. On _Tuesday_  the 22d of _July_ at Night _Edgworth Bess_ was taken in a Brandy-shop,  near _Temple-Bar_ by _Jonathan Wild_; she being much terrify'd,  discover'd where _Sheppard_ was: A Warrant was accordingly issued by  Justice _Blackerby_, and the next Day he was Apprehended, at the House  of _Blewskin's_ Mother, in _Rose-Mary-Lane_, by one _Quilt_, a Domestick  of Mr. _Wild's_ though not without great opposition, for, he clapt a  loaded, Pistol to _Quilt's_ Breast, and attempted to shoot him, but the  Pistol miss'd fire; he was brought back to _New Prison_, confin'd in the  Dungeon; and the next Day carried before Justice _Blackerby_. Upon his  Examination he Confess'd the three Robberies on the Highway  aforemention'd, as also the Robbing of Mr. _Bains_, Mr. _Barton_, and  Mr. _Kneebone_, he was committed to Newgate, and at the Sessions of  _Oyer_ and _Terminer_, and Goal delivery, holden at the _Old-Baily_, on  the 12th, 13th and 14th of _August_, he was try'd upon three several  indictments, _viz._ First for breaking the House of _William Philips_.    _John Sheppard_, of the Parish of St. _Martin_ in _the Fields_, was  indicted for breaking the House of _William Philips_, and stealing  divers Goods, the 14th of _February_ last. But there not being  sufficient Evidence against the Prisoner, he was acquitted.    He was also indicted a Second Time, of St. _Clement Danes_, for breaking  the House of _Mary Cook_, the 5th of _February_ last, and stealing  divers Goods: But the Evidence against the Prisoner being defficient as  to this Indictment also, he was acquitted.    He was also indicted the Third Time, of St. _Mary Savoy_, for breaking  the House of _William Kneebone_, in the Night-Time, and stealing, 108  Yards of Woollen Cloth, the 12th of _July_ last. The Prosecutor depos'd,  That the Prisoner had some Time since been his Servant, and when he went  to Bed, the Time mentioned in the Indictment, about 11 a-Clock at Night,  he saw all the Doors and Windows fast; but was call'd up about four in  the Morning, and found his House broke open, the Bars of a Cellar-Window  having been cut, and the Bolts of the Door that comes up Stairs drawn,  and the Padlock wrench'd off, and the Shutter in the Shop broken, and  his Goods gone; whereupon suspecting the Prisoner, he having committed  ill Actions thereabouts before, he acquainted _Jonathan Wild_ with it,  and he procur'd him to be apprehended. That he went to the Prisoners in  New _Prison_, and asking how he could be so ungrateful to rob him, after  he had shown him so much Kindness? The Prisoner own'd he had been  ungrateful in doing so, informing him of several Circumstances as to the  Manner of committing the Fact, but said he had been drawn into it by ill  Company. _Jonathan Wild_, depos'd, The Prosecutor came to him, and  desir'd him to enquire after his Goods that had been stolen, telling him  he suspected the Prisoner to have been concern'd in the Robbery, he  having before committed some Robberies in the Neighbourhood. That  inquiring after him, and having heard of him before, he was inform'd  that he was an Acquaintance of _Joseph Blake_, alias _Blewskins_, and  _William Field_: Whereupon he sent for _William Field_, who came to him;  upon which he told him, if he would make an ingenuous Confession, he  believ'd he could prevail with the Court to make him an Evidence. That  he did make a Discovery of the Prisoner, upon which he was apprehended,  and also of others since convicted, and gave an Account of some Parcels  of the Cloth, which were found accordingly. _William Field_ depos'd,  That the Prisoner told him, and _Joseph Blake_, that he knew a _Ken_  where they might get something of Worth. That they went to take a View  of the Prosecutor's House, but disprov'd of the Attempt, as not thinking  it easy to be perform'd; But the Prisoner perswaded them that it might  easily be done, he knowing the House, he having liv'd with the  Prosecutor. That thereupon he cut the Cellar Bar, went into the Cellar,  got into the Shop, and brought out three Parcels of Cloth, which they  carried away. The Prisoner had also confest the Fact when he was  apprehended, and before the Justice. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the  Jury found him guilty of the Indictment.    Sentence of Death was pronounc'd upon him accordingly. Several other  Prosecutions might have been brought against him, but this was thought  sufficient to rid the World of so Capital an Offender: He beg'd  earnestly for Transportation, to the most extream Foot of his Majesty's  Dominions; and pleaded Youth, and Ignorance as the Motive which had  precipitated him into the Guilt; but the Court deaf to his  Importunities, as knowing him, and his repeated Crimes to be equally  flagrant, gave him no satisfactory Answer: He return'd to his dismal  Abode the Condemn'd Hold, where were Nine more unhappy Wretches in as  dreadful Circumstances as himself. The Court being at _Windsor_, the  Malefactors had a longer Respite than is usual; during that Recess,  _James Harman_, _Lumley_, _Davis_ and _Sheppard_ agreed upon an Escape,  concerted Measures, and provided Instruments to make it effectual; but  put off the Execution of their Design, on Account the two Gentlemen  having their hopes of Life daily renewed by the favourable Answers they  receiv'd from some considerable Persons; but those vanishing the day  before their Execution, and finding their Sentence irreversible, they  two dropt their hopes, together with the Design, they form'd for an  Escape, and so in earnest prepar'd to meet Death on the Morrow, (which  they accordingly did.). 'Twas on this Day Mr _Davis_ gave _Sheppard_ the  Watch Springs, Files, Saws, _&c._ to Effect his own Release; and knowing  that a Warrant was Hourly expected for his Execution with Two others, on  the _Friday_ following; he thought it high time to look about him, for  he had waited his Tryal, saw his Conviction, and heard his Sentence with  some patience; but finding himself irrespitably decreed for Death, he  could sit passive no longer, and on the very Day of the Execution of the  former; whilst they were having their Fetters taken off, in order for  going to the Tree, that Day he began to saw, _Saturday_ made a progress;  but _Sunday_ omitted, by Reason of the Concourse in the _Lodge_:  _Edgworth Bess_ having been set at Liberty, had frequent Access to him,  with others of his Acquaintance. On _Monday_ the Death _Warrant_ came  from _Windsor_, appointing that he, together with _Joseph Ward_ and  _Anthony Upton_ should be Executed on the _Friday_ following, being the  4th of _September_. The Keepers acquainted him therewith, and desired  him to make good use of that short Time. He thank'd them, said _he would  follow their Advice_, and _prepare_. _Edgworth Bess_, and another Woman  had been with him at the Door of the Condemn'd Hold best part of the  Afternoon, between five and six he desir'd the other Prisoners, except  _Stephen Fowles_ to remain above, while he offer'd something in private  to his Friends at the Door; they comply'd, and in this interval he got  the Spike asunder, which made way for the Skeleton to pass with his  Heels foremost, by the Assistance of _Fowles_, whom he most ungenerously  betray'd to the Keepers after his being retaken, and the Fellow was as  severely punish'd for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#3)"],[1,"in Familiar Lectures\" by  using it as a text-book for my classes, I take pleasure in giving this  testimonial of my cordial approbation of the work. Mr. Kirkham has  attempted to improve upon this branch of science, chiefly by unfolding  and explaining the principles of grammar in a manner so clear and  simple, as _to adapt them completely to the understanding_ of the young  learner, and by adopting a new arrangement, which enables the pupil to  commit the principles by a simultaneous application of them to practical  examples. The public may rest assured, that he has been successful in  his attempt _in a pre-eminent degree_. I make this assertion under a  full conviction that it will be corroborated by every candid judge of  the science who becomes acquainted with the practical advantages of this  manual.    The explicit brevity and accuracy of the rules and definitions, the  novel, the striking, the lucid, and critical illustrations accompanying  them, the peculiar and advantageous arrangement of the various parts of  the subject, the facilities proffered by the \"systematic mode of  parsing\" adopted, the convenient and judicious introduction and  adaptation of the exercises introduced, and the deep researches and  critical investigations displayed in the \"Philosophical Notes,\" render  this system of grammar _so decidedly superior to all others extant_,  that, to receive general patronage, it needs but to be known.    My knowledge of this system from experience in teaching it, and  witnessing its effects in the hands of private learners, warrants me in  saying, that a learner will, by studying this book _four months without  a teacher_, obtain a more clear conception of the nature and proper  construction of words and phrases, than is ordinarily obtained in common  schools and academies, _in five times four months_.    It is highly gratifying to know, that wherever this system has been  circulated, it is very rapidly supplanting those works of dulness which  have so long paralyzed the energies of the youth of our country.    I think the specimens of verbal criticism, additional corrections in  orthography and ortheopy, the leading principles of rhetoric, and the  improvements in the illustrations generally, which Mr. K. is about  introducing into his ELEVENTH EDITION, will render it quite _an  improvement on the former editions of this work_. H. WINCHESTER.    From the Rev. S. Center, Principal of a Classical Academy.            I have examined the last edition of Kirkham's Grammar with peculiar  satisfaction. The improvements which appear in it, do, in my estimation,  give it a decided preference to any other system now in use. To point  out the peculiar qualities which secure to it claims of which no other  system can boast, would be, if required, perfectly easy. At present it  is sufficient to remark, that it imbodies all that is essentially  excellent and useful in other systems, while it is entirely free from  that tediousness of method and prolixity of definition which so much  perplex and embarrass the learner.    The peculiar excellence of Mr. Kirkham's grammar is, _the simplicity of  its method_, and _the plainness of its illustrations_. Being conducted  by familiar lectures, the teacher and pupil are necessarily brought into  agreeable contact by each lesson. Both are improved by the same task,  without the slightest suspicion, on the part of the pupil, that there is  anything hard, difficult, or obscure in the subject: a conviction, this,  which must inevitably precede all efforts, or no proficiency will be  made. In a word, the treatise I am recommending, is a _practical_ one;  and for that reason, if there were no others to be urged, it ought to be  introduced into all our schools and academies. From actual experiment I  can attest to the practicability of the plan which the author has  adopted. Of this fact any one may be convinced who will take the pains  to make the experiment. SAMUEL CENTER.    Albany, July 10, 1829.          From a communication addressed to S. Kirkham, by the Rev. J. Stockton,  author of the \"Western Calculator\" and \"Western Spelling-Book.\"    Dear Sir,--I am much pleased with both the _plan_ and _execution_ of  your \"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures.\" In giving a _systematic  mode of parsing_, calculated alike to exercise the _understanding_ and  _memory_ of the pupil, and also free the teacher from the _drudgery_ of  continued interrogation, you have made your grammar what every  _elementary_ school book ought to be--_plain, systematic_, and _easy_ to  be understood.    This, with the copious definitions in every part of the work, and other  improvements so judiciously introduced, gives it _a decisive  superiority_ over the imperfect grammar of Murray, now so generally  used. JOSEPH STOCKTON, A.M.    Allegheny-Town, (near Pittsburgh,) March 18, 1825.          TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION.    The author is free to acknowledge, that since this treatise first  ventured on the wave of public opinion, the gales of patronage which  have waited it along, have been far more favorable than he had reason to  anticipate. Had any one, on its first appearance, predicted, that the  demand for it would call forth _twenty-two thousand_ copies during the  past year, the author would have considered the prediction extravagant  and chimerical. In gratitude, therefore, to that public which has smiled  so propitiously on his humble efforts to advance the cause of learning,  he has endeavored, by unremitting attention to the improvement of his  work, to render it as useful and as unexceptionable as his time and  talents would permit.    It is believed that the _tenth_ and _eleventh_ editions have been  greatly improved; but the author is apprehensive that his work is not  yet as accurate and as much simplified as it may be. If, however, the  disadvantages of lingering under a broken constitution, and of being  able to devote to this subject only a small portion of his time,  snatched from the active pursuits of a business life, (_active_ as far  as his imperfect health permits him to be,) are any apology for its  defects, he hopes that the candid will set down the apology to his  credit. This personal allusion is hazarded with the additional hope,  that it will ward off some of the arrows of criticism which may be aimed  at him, and render less pointed and poisonous those that may fall upon  him. Not that he would beg a truce with the gentlemen critics and  reviewers. Any compromise with them would betray a want of  self-confidence and moral courage which he would, by no means, be  willing to avow. It would, moreover, be prejudicial to his interest; for  he is determined, if his life be preserved, to avail himself of the  advantages of any judicious and candid criticisms on his production,  that may appear, and, two or three years hence, _revise_ his work, and  present to the public another and a better edition.    The improvements in the _tenth_ edition, consisted mainly in the  addition of many important principles; in rendering the illustrations  more critical, extensive, accurate, and lucid; in connecting more  closely with the genius and philosophy of our language, the general  principles adopted; and in adding a brief view of philosophical grammar  interspersed in notes. The introduction into the ELEVENTH EDITION, of  many verbal criticisms, of additional corrections in orthography and  orthoepy, of the leading principles of rhetoric, and of general  additions and improvements in various parts of the work, render _this  edition/,_ it is believed, _far preferable_ to any of the former  editions of the work.    Perhaps some will regard the philosophical notes as a useless exhibition  of pedantry. If so, the author's only apology is, that some  investigations of this nature seemed to be called for by a portion of  the community whose minds, of late, appear to be under the influence of  a kind of _philosophical mania;_ and to such these notes are  respectfully submitted for just what _they_ may deem their real value.  The author's own opinion on this point, is, that they proffer no  _material_ advantages to common learners; but that they may profitably  engage the attention of the curious, and perhaps impart a degree of  interest to the literary connoisseur.
