Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country  who represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not  involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head  of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day  activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief  of state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,  the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.    Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived  by a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each  age remains constant in the future.    Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent  some national claims from being fully extended.    Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All  commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which  excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.         Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory,  possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships  owned in the parent country. Also referred to as an offshore register,  the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive  register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local  variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation  rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive  register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned  abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience  register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.         Flag of convenience register--A national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.         Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which  holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home  or abroad. Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine  how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be  placed on the register.          Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of  a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by  foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state  (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International  Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most  notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental  in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in  attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.         Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight. Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately  restricted to commercial vessels only.         Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as  listed with the maritime authorities of a country. Also, the  compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of  a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws  of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the  nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars  unless otherwise indicated.    Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons  entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons  (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the  country is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000  population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net  emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).    Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census  based on statistics from population censuses, vital registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on  assumptions about future trends.    Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age.    Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless  indicated as fiscal year (FY).    -------------------------------------------------------------------                          THE WORLD FACTBOOK 1990  -------------------------------------------------------------------    Country:  Afghanistan  - Geography  Total area: 647,500 km2; land area: 647,500 km2    Comparative area: slightly smaller than Texas    Land boundaries: 5,826 km total; China 76 km, Iran 936 km,  Pakistan 2,430 km, USSR 2,384 km    Coastline: none--landlocked    Maritime claims: none--landlocked    Disputes: Pashtun question with Pakistan; Baloch question with Iran  and Pakistan; periodic disputes with Iran over Helmand water rights;  insurgency with Iranian and Pakistani involvement; traditional tribal  rivalries    Climate: arid to semiarid; cold winters and hot summers    Terrain: mostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest    Natural resources: natural gas, crude oil, coal, copper, talc, barites,  sulphur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, precious and semiprecious stones    Land use: 12% arable land; NEGL% permanent crops; 46% meadows and  pastures; 3% forest and woodland; 39% other; includes NEGL% irrigated    Environment: damaging earthquakes occur in Hindu Kush mountains;  soil degradation, desertification, overgrazing, deforestation, pollution    Note: landlocked    - People  Population: 15,862,293 (July 1990), growth rate 7.7% (1990)    Birth rate: 44 births/1,000 population (1990)    Death rate: 18 deaths/1,000 population (1990)    Net migration rate: 51 migrants/1,000 population (1990);  note--there are flows across the border in both directions, but data are  fragmentary and unreliable    Infant mortality rate: 154 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)    Life expectancy at birth: 47 years male, 46 years female (1990)    Total fertility rate: 6.4 children born/woman (1990)    Nationality: noun--Afghan(s); adjective--Afghan    Ethnic divisions: 50% Pashtun, 25% Tajik, 9% Uzbek, 12-15% Hazara; minor  ethnic groups include Chahar Aimaks, Turkmen, Baloch, and others    Religion: 74% Sunni Muslim, 15% Shia Muslim, 11% other    Language: 50% Pashtu, 35% Afghan Persian (Dari), 11% Turkic languages  (primarily Uzbek and Turkmen), 4% thirty minor languages (primarily  Balochi and Pashai); much bilingualism    Literacy: 12%    Labor force: 4,980,000; 67.8% agriculture and animal husbandry,  10.2% industry, 6.3% construction, 5.0% commerce, 10.7% services and other  (1980 est.)
