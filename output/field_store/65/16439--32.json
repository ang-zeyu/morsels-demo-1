It is because they have done so that  many ponderous tomes of learning and industry stand neglected on the  shelves of great libraries. Time is too precious now-a-days, whatever  may have been the case of our forefathers, for it to be dissipated by  diving into the muddy waters of voluminous authors in hopes of finding  an occasional pearl of wisdom. And unless some intelligent and  painstaking compiler set himself to the task of separating the gold from  the rubbish in which it is imbedded in those graves of learning, and  present the results of his labour in an attractive form, such works are  virtually lost to the world. For in these high-pressure days, most of  us, \"like the dogs in Egypt for fear of the crocodiles, must drink of  the waters of knowledge as we run, in dread of the old enemy Time.\"    Saadi, however, in his _Gulistan_ sets forth only his well-pondered  thoughts in the most felicitous and expressive language. There is no  need to form an abstract or epitome of a work in which nothing is  superfluous, nothing valueless. But, as in a cabinet of gems some are  more beautiful than others, or as in a garden some flowers are more  attractive from their brilliant hues and fragrant odours, so a selection  may be made of the more striking tales and aphorisms of the illustrious  Persian philosopher.    The preface to the _Gulistan_ is one of the most pleasing portions of  the whole book. Now prefaces are among those parts of books which are  too frequently \"skipped\" by readers--they are \"taken as read.\" Why this  should be so, I confess I cannot understand. For my part, I make a point  of reading a preface at least twice: first, because I would know what  reasons my author had for writing his book, and again, having read his  book, because the preface, if well written, may serve also as a sort of  appendix. Authors are said to bestow particular pains on their prefaces.  Cervantes, for instance, tells us that the preface to the first part of  _Don Quixote_ cost him more thought than the writing of the entire work.  \"It argues a deficiency of taste,\" says Isaac D'Israeli, \"to turn over  an elaborate preface unread; for it is the essence of the author's  roses--every drop distilled at an immense cost.\" And, no doubt, it is a  great slight to an author to skip his preface, though it cannot be  denied that some prefaces are very tedious, because the writer \"spins  out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument,\"  and none but the most _hardy_ readers can persevere to the distant end.  The Italians call a preface _salsa del libro_, the _salt_ of the book. A  preface may also be likened to the porch of a mansion, where it is not  courteous to keep a visitor waiting long before you open the door and  make him free of your house. But the reader who passes over the preface  to the _Gulistan_ unread loses not a little of the spice of that  fascinating and instructive book. He who reads it, however, is rewarded  by the charming account which the author gives of how he came to form  his literary Rose-Garden:    \"It was the season of spring; the air was temperate and the rose in full  bloom. The vestments of the trees resembled the festive garments of the  fortunate. It was mid-spring, when the nightingales were chanting from  their pulpits in the branches. The rose, decked with pearly dew, like  blushes on the cheek of a chiding mistress. It happened once that I was  benighted in a garden, in company with a friend. The spot was  delightful: the trees intertwined; you would have said that the earth  was bedecked with glass spangles, and that the knot of the Pleiades was  suspended from the branch of the vine. A garden with a running stream,  and trees whence birds were warbling melodious strains: that filled with  tulips of various hues; these loaded with fruits of several kinds. Under  the shade of its trees the zephyr had spread the variegated carpet.    \"In the morning, when the desire to return home overcame our inclination  to remain, I saw in my friend's lap a collection of roses, odoriferous  herbs, and hyacinths, which he intended to carry to town. I said: 'You  are not ignorant that the flower of the garden soon fadeth, and that the  enjoyment of the rose-bush is of short continuance; and the sages have  declared that the heart ought not to be set upon anything that is  transitory.' He asked: 'What course is then to be pursued?' I replied:  'I am able to form a book of roses, which will delight the beholders and  gratify those who are present; whose leaves the tyrannic arm of autumnal  blasts can never affect, or injure the blossoms of its spring. What  benefit will you derive from a basket of flowers? Carry a leaf from my  garden: a rose may continue in bloom five or six days, but this  Rose-Garden will flourish for ever.' As soon as I had uttered these  words, he flung the flowers from his lap, and, laying hold of the skirt  of my garment, exclaimed: 'When the beneficent promise, they faithfully  discharge their engagements.' In the course of a few days two chapters  were written in my note-book, in a style that may be useful to orators  and improve the skill of letter-writers. In short, while the rose was  still in bloom, the book called the Rose-Garden was finished.\"    Dr. Johnson has remarked that \"there is scarcely any poet of eminence  who has not left some testimony of his fondness for the flowers, the  zephyrs, and the warblers of the spring.\" This is pre-eminently the case  of Oriental poets, from Solomon downwards: \"Rise up, my love, my fair  one, and come away,\" exclaims the Hebrew poet in his Book of Canticles:  \"for lo! the winter is past, the rain is over and gone: the flowers  appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds has come, and the  voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The fig-tree putteth forth her  green fruits, and the vines with the tender grapes give forth a good  smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.\"    In a Persian poem written in the 14th century the delights of the vernal  season are thus described: \"On every bush roses were blowing; on every  branch the nightingale was plaintively warbling. The tall cypress was  dancing in the garden; and the poplar never ceased clapping its hands  with joy. With a loud voice from the top of every bough the turtle-dove  was proclaiming the glad advent of spring. The diadem of the narcissus  shone with such splendour that you would have said it was the crown of  the Emperor of China. On this side the north wind, on that, the west  wind, were, in token of affection, scattering dirhams at the feet of the  rose.[3] The earth was musk-scented, the air musk-laden.\"        [3] Referring to the custom of throwing small coins among          crowds in the street on the occasion of a wedding. A          dirham is a coin nearly equal in value to sixpence of          our money.    But it would be difficult to adduce from the writings of any poet,  European or Asiatic, anything to excel the charming ode on spring, by  the Turkish poet Mesihi, who flourished in the 15th century, which has  been rendered into graceful English verse, and in the measure of the  original, by my friend Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, in his dainty volume of  _Ottoman Poems_, published in London a few years ago. These are some of  the verses from that fine ode:      Hark! the bulbul's[4] lay so joyous: \"Now have come the days of spring!\"    Merry shows and crowds on every mead they spread, a maze of spring;    There the almond-tree its silvery blossoms scatters, sprays of spring:    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, biding not, the days of spring!_[5]      Once again, with flow'rets decked themselves have mead and plain;    Tents for pleasure have the blossoms raised in every rosy lane;    Who can tell, when spring hath ended, who and what may whole remain?    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, biding not, the days of spring!_           *       *       *       *       *      Sparkling dew-drops stud the lily's leaf like sabre broad and keen;    Bent on merry gipsy party, crowd they all the flow'ry green!    List to me, if thou desirest, these beholding, joy to glean:    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, biding not, the days of spring!_      Rose and tulip, like to maidens' cheeks, all beauteous show,    Whilst the dew-drops, like the jewels in their ears, resplendent glow;    Do not think, thyself beguiling, things will aye continue so:    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, biding not, the days of spring!_           *       *       *       *       *      Whilst each dawn the clouds are shedding jewels o'er the rosy land,    And the breath of morning zephyr, fraught with Tatar musk, is bland;    Whilst the world's fair time is present, do not thou unheeding stand:    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, biding not, the days of spring!_      With the fragrance of the garden, so imbued the musky air,    Every dew-drop, ere it reaches earth, is turned to attar rare;    O'er the parterre spread the incense-clouds a canopy right fair:    _Gaily live! for soon will vanish, Biding not, the days of spring!_        [4] The nightingale.

There shall be for you on earth a habitation and  provision for a time.    S: But the Shaitan made them both fall from it, and caused them to  depart from that (state) in which they were; and We said: Get forth,  some of you being the enemies of others, and there is for you in the  earth an abode and a provision for a time.    002.037  Y: Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord  Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.    P: Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He  relented toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful.    S: Then Adam received (some) words from his Lord, so He turned to him  mercifully; surely He is Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.    002.038  Y: We said: \"Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes  to you Guidance from me,\" whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall  be no fear, nor shall they grieve.    P: We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh  unto you from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there  shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.    S: We said: Go forth from this (state) all; so surely there will come to  you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, no fear shall  come upon them, nor shall they grieve.    002.039  Y: \"But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be  companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein.\"    P: But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful  Peoples of the Fire. They will abide therein.    S: And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My communications,  they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.    002.040  Y: O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I  bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My  Covenant with you, and fear none but Me.    P: O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you,  and fulfil your (part of the) covenant, I shall fulfil My (part of the)  covenant, and fear Me.    S: O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you  and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, I will fulfill (My)  covenant with you; and of Me, Me alone, should you be afraid.    002.041  Y: And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with  you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs  for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone.    P: And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess  already (of the Scripture), and be not first to disbelieve therein, and  part not with My revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty  unto Me.    S: And believe in what I have revealed, verifying that which is with  you, and be not the first to deny it, neither take a mean price in  exchange for My communications; and Me, Me alone should you fear.    002.042  Y: And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye  know (what it is).    P: Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth.    S: And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood, nor hide the truth  while you know (it).    002.043  Y: And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down  your heads with those who bow down (in worship).    P: Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those  who bow (in worship).    S: And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who  bow down.    002.044  Y: Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (To practise it)  yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?    P: Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget (to  practise it)? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no  sense?    S: What! do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while  you read the Book; have you then no sense?    002.045  Y: Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is  indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,-    P: Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the  humble-minded,    S: And seek assistance through patience and prayer, and most surely it  is a hard thing except for the humble ones,    002.046  Y: Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and  that they are to return to Him.    P: Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him  they are returning.

P: And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail  another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will  compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped.    S: And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail  another in the least, neither shall intercession on its behalf be  accepted, nor shall any compensation be taken from it, nor shall they  be helped.    002.049  Y: And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set  you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your  women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.    P: And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were  afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing  your women: that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.    S: And when We delivered you from Firon's people, who subjected you to  severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this  there was a great trial from your Lord.    002.050  Y: And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned  Pharaoh's people within your very sight.    P: And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned  the folk of Pharaoh in your sight.    S: And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned the  followers of Firon and you watched by.    002.051  Y: And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence  ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.    P: And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights (of solitude), and  then ye chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were  wrong-doers.    S: And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa, then you took  the calf (for a god) after him and you were unjust.    002.052  Y: Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be  grateful.    P: Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give  thanks.    S: Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks.    002.053  Y: And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between  right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.    P: And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion (of right  and wrong), that ye might be led aright.    S: And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you might  walk aright.    002.054  Y: And remember Moses said to his people: \"O my people! Ye have indeed  wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance)  to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be  better for you in the sight of your Maker.\" Then He turned towards you  (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.    P: And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged  yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in  penitence to your Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will  be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo! He  is the Relenting, the Merciful.    S: And when Musa said to his people: O my people! you have surely been  unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god), therefore turn to  your Creator (penitently), so kill your people, that is best for you  with your Creator: so He turned to you (mercifully), for surely He is  the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.    002.055  Y: And remember ye said: \"O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until  we see Allah manifestly,\" but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting  even as ye looked on.    P: And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see  Allah plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you.    S: And when you said: O Musa! we will not believe in you until we see  Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while you looked on.    002.056  Y: Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be  grateful.    P: Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks.    S: Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks.    002.057  Y: And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and  quails, saying: \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you:\" (But  they rebelled); to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own  souls.    P: And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you  the manna and the quails, (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We  have provided you- they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves.    S: And We made the clouds to give shade"]]]
