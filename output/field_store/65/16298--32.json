He liked to be upon the side of her  successes. He constantly helped us to believe in, and to will towards  the existence of such a world here on earth, as we have set our heart  upon. He is not an idealist in the vague sense, for he imports no beauty  merely from dreamland. Like the Greeks, he makes _the possible_ his  single ideal. In insisting upon the possibility of beauty and  suppressing every reference to the monstrous story of failure which the  existence of hideousness implies, once more he puts the world in debt to  art after the fashion of the old masters. For after all it seems to have  been left for modern artists to grow wealthy and live comfortably upon  the proceeds of their own relation of the world's despair; if they are  playwrights, to live most snugly upon the box-receipts of an entrapped  audience unnerved for the struggle of life by their ghastly picture of  life's gloom.    However splendid the art in such a case we put it well down below that  art which exerts the same amount of effort in trying to sustain the will  to believe in, and so to bring about the reign of things we really want.    Du Maurier's art was nearer to reality, and not farther away, in the  charming side of it. Realism does not necessarily imply only the  representation of the mean and the defaulting. It is perhaps because  humanity so passionately desires the reign of beauty that it is inclined  to doubt that art which witnesses to the dream of it as already partly  true.    Although du Maurier's art in its tenderness is romantic, in its belief  in the ideal and in its insistence upon type rather than individuality  it is Classic. In the fact that it is so it fails in intimacy of  mood--just the intimacy that is the soul of Keene's art, which descends  from Rembrandt's. But this point will come up for consideration farther  on. Here it only concerns us in its connection with the psychology of  the people it interprets in satire. There is the psychology of  individuals and the psychology of a whole society--the latter was du  Maurier's theme. It is generally an obsession, a \"fad,\" a \"craze,\" or  \"fashion\" that his pencil exploits. He does not with Keene laugh with an  individual at another individual. His art is well-bred in its style  partly through the fact of its limitations. Moreover, in \"Society\"  individuality tends to be less evident than amongst the poorer classes,  with whom eccentricity is respected. In \"Society\" the force of  individuality now runs beneath the surface of observable varieties of  costume, taking a subterranean course with an impulse to avoid  everything that would give rise to comment. But the conformity of  \"Society\" in small things is only a mask. Du Maurier's real weakness in  satire was that he did not quite perceive this. He was inclined to  accept appearances for realities, with the consequence that the record  he transmits of late Victorian Society obscures the quite feverish  genius of that age.      Section 4    It has often been remarked that the comparative failure of du Maurier's  successors seems the result of a difficulty in drawing \"a lady\"  unmistakably. We can forgive much to the artist who brought the English  lady, by many accounted the finest in the world, into real existence in  modern comic art. We shall have to forgive him for turning into a lady  every woman who was not middle-aged. Du Maurier's picture of Society was  largely falsified by his inability to appreciate variety in feminine  genius. But we are quite prepared to believe that his treatment of the  dainty parlour-maid, for instance, helped to confirm that tradition of  refinement in table service which is the pleasant feature of English  home life. All the servants shown in his pictures are ladies, and this  before the fashion had made any headway of engaging ladies as servants.  And we cannot help feeling such delightful child-life as he represents  could only have retained its characteristics under the wing of the  beautiful women who nurse it in his pictures.    [Illustration: \"The Cilician Pirates\"    _The Cornhill_, April 1863.]    Both du Maurier and Keene knew the _genus_ artist in all its varieties;  and it is very interesting to contrast, and note the difference between,  the \"Artist\" whom du Maurier brings into his society scenes and the one  of Keene's drawings. In Keene's case the \"artist\" is generally a  slouching Bohemian creature who belongs to a world of his own, and bears  the stamp of \"stranger\" upon him in any other. But the \"artist\" of du  Maurier, putting aside the aesthete coterie, with whom we shall deal  presently, wears upon him every outward symbol of peace with the  world--_The_ world, Mayfair. He is always an \"R.A.\"--symbol of  respectability--whether du Maurier mentions it or not. With this type  Art is one of the great recognised professions like The Army or The Bar.  We have no curiosity as to what sort of pictures they paint. We know  that their art was suitable for the Academy, therefore for the Victorian  Drawing-room. We are merely amused at the solemnity of manner with which  they assumed that their large-sized Christmas cards had anything to do  with art at all--cards which lost the purchasers of them such enormous  sums when sold again at Christie's that the shaken confidence of the  public as to the worth of modern pictures has not recovered to this day.    All through this state of things, too, the really vital work of the time  was left to the encouragement of those whom \"Society\" would then have  called \"outsiders,\" and it was just this failure on the part of the  aristocracy to enlist the genius of the period on its own side that  betrayed its decrepitude.      Section 5    The enduring feature of du Maurier's art, that which survives in it  better than its sometimes scathing commentary upon a passing \"craze,\" is  his close representation of the air with which people seek to foil each  other in conversation and conceal their own trepidations. His \"Social  Agonies\" are among the best of this series. If he does not lay stress  upon individual character, he still remains the master draughtsman of a  state of mind. He succeeds thus in the very field where probably all  that is most important in modern art, whether of the novel or of  illustration, will be found.    Behind the economy of word and gesture in the conversational method of  to-day there lies the history of the long struggle of the race through  volubility to refinement of expression. Du Maurier's _Punch_ pictures  take their place in the field of psychology in which the modern novel  has secured its greatest results, and the best appreciation of his  _Punch_ work was written in the eighties by Mr. Henry James, the supreme  master in this field; the master of suspenses that are greater than the  conversations in which they happen; the explorer of twilights of  consciousness in which little passions contend.    The Society du Maurier depicted held its position upon more comfortable  terms than any preceding it in history. It did not have, on the one  hand, to trim to a court party, or, on the other, to concede anything to  the people to keep itself in power. Yet it was as swollen with pride in  its position as any society has ever been. The industrial phenomena of  the age had suddenly filled its pockets; and it had nothing else in the  world to do but to blow itself out with pride. But a Society holding its  position without an effort of some kind of its own is bound to lose in  character, and the confession of all the best literature of this time  was of the baffled search for the soul of the prosperous class.      Section 6    For the appreciation of the artist's management of dialogue we must move  for a page or two in Mrs. de Tomkyns' circle with Miss Lyon Hunter, Sir  Gorgius Midas the Plutocrat, Sir Pompey Bedel (of Bedel, Flunke & Co.)  the successful professional man, and the rest of the whole set, who  understand each other in the freemasonry of a common ambition to get  into another set.         _Mamma_. \"Enfin, my love! We're well out of this! _What_ a gang!!!       Where shall we go next?\"         _Daughter_. \"To Lady Oscar Talbot's, Mamma.\"         _Mamma_. \"She _snubs_ one so I really can't _bear_ it! Let us go to       Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns. It's just as select (except the Host and       Hostess) and quite as amusing.\"         _Daughter_. \"But Mrs. Tomkyns snubs one worse than Lady Oscar,       Mamma!\"         _Mamma_. \"Pooh, my love! who cares for the snubs of a Mrs. Ponsonby       de Tomkyns I should like to know, so long as she's clever enough to       get the right people.\"    This is the conversation in the hall between two ladies leaving a party  in one of du Maurier's most characteristic drawings. On every side there  are footmen and a crowd of guests cloaking and departing. Of Mrs.  Ponsonby de Tomkyns Mr. Henry James has said: \"This lady is a real  creation.... She is not one of the heroines of the aesthetic movement,  though we may be sure she dabbles in that movement so far as it pays to  do so. Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns is a little of everything, in so far as  anything pays. She is always on the look-out; she never misses an  opportunity. She is not a specialist, for that cuts off too many  opportunities, and the aesthetic people have the _tort_ as the French  say, to be specialists. No, Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns is--what shall we  call her?--well, she is the modern social spirit. She is prepared for  everything; she is ready to take advantage of everything; she would  invite Mr. Bradlaugh to dinner if she thought the Duchess would come to  meet him. The Duchess is her great achievement--she never lets go of her  Duchess. She is young, very nice-looking, slim, graceful, indefatigable.  She tires poor Ponsonby completely out; she can keep going for hours  after poor Ponsonby is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#3)"],[1,"\"Sheikh el Beled,\" Ancient Empire    192.

Archaeologists, when visiting Egypt, have so concentrated their attention  upon temples and tombs, that not one has devoted himself to a careful  examination of the existing remains of private dwellings and military  buildings. Few countries, nevertheless, have preserved so many relics of  their ancient civil architecture. Setting aside towns of Roman or Byzantine  date, such as are found almost intact at Koft (Coptos), at Kom Ombo, and at  El Agandiyeh, one-half at least of ancient Thebes still exists on the east  and south of Karnak. The site of Memphis is covered with mounds, some of  which are from fifty to sixty feet in height, each containing a core of  houses in good preservation. At Kahun, the ruins and remains of a whole  provincial Twelfth Dynasty town have been laid bare; at Tell el Mask-hutah,  the granaries of Pithom are yet standing; at San (Tanis) and Tell Basta  (Bubastis), the Ptolemaic and Saitic cities contain quarters of which plans  might be made (Note 1), and in many localities which escape the traveller's  notice, there may be seen ruins of private dwellings which date back to the  age of the Ramessides, or to a still earlier period. As regards  fortresses, there are two in the town of Abydos alone, one of which is at  least contemporary with the Sixth Dynasty; while the ramparts of El Kab, of  Kom el Ahmar, of El Hibeh, and of Dakkeh, as well as part of the  fortifications of Thebes, are still standing, and await the architect who  shall deign to make them an object of serious study.           *       *       *       *       *          1.--PRIVATE DWELLINGS.      The soil of Egypt, periodically washed by the inundation, is a black,  compact, homogeneous clay, which becomes of stony hardness when dry. From  immemorial time, the fellahin have used it for the construction of their  houses. The hut of the poorest peasant is a mere rudely-shaped mass of this  clay. A rectangular space, some eight or ten feet in width, by perhaps  sixteen or eighteen feet in length, is enclosed in a wickerwork of palm-  branches, coated on both sides with a layer of mud. As this coating cracks  in the drying the fissures are filled in, and more coats of mud are daubed  on until the walls attain a thickness of from four inches to a foot.  Finally, the whole is roofed over with palm-branches and straw, the top  being covered in with a thin layer of beaten earth. The height varies. In  most huts, the ceiling is so low that to rise suddenly is dangerous both to  one's head and to the structure, while in others the roof is six or seven  feet from the floor. Windows, of course, there are none. Sometimes a hole  is left in the middle of the roof to let the smoke out; but this is a  refinement undreamed of by many.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Brickmaking, from Eighteenth Dynasty tomb-painting,  Tomb of Rekhmara.]    At the first glance, it is not always easy to distinguish between these  huts of wattle and daub and those built with crude bricks. The ordinary  Egyptian brick is a mere oblong block of mud mixed with chopped straw and a  little sand, and dried in the sun. At a spot where they are about to build,  one man is told off to break up the ground; others carry the clods, and  pile them in a heap, while others again mix them with water, knead the clay  with their feet, and reduce it to a homogeneous paste. This paste, when  sufficiently worked (Note 2), is pressed by the head workman in moulds made  of hard wood, while an assistant carries away the bricks as fast as they  are shaped, and lays them out in rows at a little distance apart, to dry in  the sun (fig. I). A careful brickmaker will leave them thus for half a day,  or even for a whole day, after which the bricks are piled in stacks in such  wise that the air can circulate freely among them; and so they remain for a  week or two before they are used. More frequently, however, they are  exposed for only a few hours to the heat of the sun, and the building is  begun while they are yet damp. The mud, however, is so tenacious that,  notwithstanding this carelessness, they are not readily put out of shape.  The outer faces of the bricks become disintegrated by the action of the  weather, but those in the inner part of the wall remain intact, and are  still separable. A good modern workman will easily mould a thousand bricks  a day, and after a week's practice he may turn out 1,200, 1,500, or even  1,800. The ancient workmen, whose appliances in no wise differed from those  of the present day, produced equally satisfactory results. The dimensions  they generally adopted were 8.7 x 4.3 x 5.5 inches for ordinary bricks, or  15.0 x 7.1 x 5.5 for a larger size (Note 3), though both larger and smaller  are often met with in the ruins. Bricks issued from the royal workshops  were sometimes stamped with the cartouches of the reigning monarch; while  those made in private factories bore on the side a trade mark in red ochre,  a squeeze of the moulder's fingers, or the stamp of the maker. By far the  greater number have, however, no distinctive mark. Burnt bricks were not  often used before the Roman period (Note 4), nor tiles, either flat or  curved. Glazed bricks appear to have been the fashion in the Delta. The  finest specimen that I have seen, namely, one in the Gizeh Museum, is  inscribed in black ink with the cartouches of Rameses III. The glaze of  this brick is green, but other fragments are coloured blue, red, yellow, or  white.    The nature of the soil does not allow of deep foundations. It consists of a  thin bed of made earth, which, except in large towns, never reaches any  degree of thickness; below this comes a very dense humus, permeated by  slender veins of sand; and below this again--at the level of infiltration--  comes a bed of mud, more or less soft, according to the season. The native  builders of the present day are content to remove only the made earth, and  lay their foundations on the primeval soil; or, if that lies too deep, they  stop at a yard or so below the surface. The old Egyptians did likewise; and  I have never seen any ancient house of which the foundations were more than  four feet deep. Even this is exceptional, the depth in most cases being not  more than two feet. They very often did not"]]]
