Lord Brougham is thoroughly individualized as regards his talents and all  that constitutes idiosyncratic difference, even while he is identified  with the political and moral advancement of the people. During all the  agitations of a period almost unparalleled, he has remained untainted by  the influence of party spirit. That he has entered, and hotly too, into  almost every question of any moment that has come before the Legislature  during many years is true; but he has never appeared in the character of  a partisan; he has always been the consistent supporter of liberal  measures _per se_, and not because they were the means adopted by a party  to gain political power. With his political steadfastness he has  preserved his intellectual integrity from profanation. For although, had  he early devoted his powers to the study of abstract or practical  science, as a leading and not a subsidiary pursuit, the acuteness of his  mind was such, that he must have risen to eminence upon the basis of  discovery, yet it is no slight proof how little the struggles of the  world affect superior intellects, that he has all along turned aside,  with a never cloying  avidity, to the pursuits of mind--to science, to  literature, and to philosophy.           *       *       *       *       *      THE WHITE LADY.    The readers of _The International_ may have seen some account of an  apparition said to have been seen recently in the royal palace at Berlin,  and known under the name of the \"White Lady.\" M. Minutoli, lately chief  of the Police at Berlin, has been amusing himself by looking up the  history of this visitant from the unknown world, and has published a  variety of curious particulars respecting her, drawn in a measure from  documents preserved in the royal archives, as well as from old-time  chronicles and dissertations, Latin and German middle age doggerel, and  the records of jurists, historians and theologists. Several persons are  designated in the early history of the family of Hohenzollern as that  unquiet soul who for some three hundred years has performed the functions  of palace-ghost. Many writers agree that she was a Countess named  Orlamuende, Beatrice, or Cunigunde, and that she was desperately in love  with Count Albert of Nuremberg, and was led by her passion to a crime  which is the cause of her subsequent ghostly disquiet. Mr. Minutoli  proves that this lady cannot be the same that alarms the palace with her  untimely visitations. The accounts of the White Lady ascend to 1486, and  she was first seen at Baireuth. Subsequently two ghosts were heard of,  one white and one black. They were several times boldly interrogated and  interesting discoveries arrived at. In 1540, Count Albert the Warrior  laid in wait for the apparition, seized it with his powerful arm and  flung it head over heels down into the castle court-yard. The next  morning the chancellor, Christopher Hass, was found there with his neck  broken, and upon his person a dagger and a letter proving him to have had  treasonable designs. Notwithstanding the spirit has several times been  thus compromised, it has maintained itself to the present day. It was  first seen in Berlin January 1, 1598, eight days before the death of the  Prince Royal John George. When the French invasion took place, it  returned to Baireuth and was patriotic enough to take up its abode in the  new chateau which had never been occupied before the arrival of the  French officer. Even Napoleon called the place _ce maudit chateau_, on  account of its mysterious inhabitant, and had to give up his lodgings  to the ghost. He stopped in the chateau on his way to Russia but when he  returned next year he avoided passing the night there. With regard to the  last appearance at the palace at Berlin just before the late attempt on  the life of the king, and which has been described as \"a fearful  apparition of a White Lady dressed in thin and flowing garments, moving  slowly and silently around and around the fountain to the terror of a  corporal standing near the entrance to the silver chamber,\" M. Minutoli  proves it to have been an old woman once a cook at the chateau who has  since lived there and is known, by the nickname of Black Minna.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: MRS. FANNY KEMBLE READING SHAKSPEARE AT THE ST. JAMES'  THEATER.]      MRS. FANNY KEMBLE'S \"READINGS\" IN LONDON.    MRS. KEMBLE has been giving a series of dramatic readings in London, and  her success in the scene of her early triumphs appears to have been as  decided as it was in New York. She was never in a situation more  agreeable to her temper and ambition than that represented in the above  engraving, which we have copied from one in _The Illustrated News_. She  is triumphant, and \"alone in her glory.\"    Mrs. Kemble is now about forty years of age. Gentleness is acquired in  three generations; she is removed but two from the most vulgar condition;  and by the mother's side but one. The Kembles of the last age were  extraordinary persons. John Philip Kemble and Mrs. Siddons had both  remarkable genius, and Charles Kemble has been an actor of consummate  talent. Whatever intellect remains in the family is in his children; one  of whom is a man of learning and refinement, another a woman of some  cleverness in musical art, and Frances Anne, of whom we write more  particularly.    The first appearance of Miss Kemble on the stage was on the evening of  the 5th October, 1829, at Covent Garden, and was hazarded with the view  of redeeming the fortunes of the theater. The play was \"Romeo and  Juliet,\" and the heroine was sustained by the debutante with unexpected  power. Her Siddonian countenance and expressive eyes were the general  theme of admiration; while the tenderness and ardor of her action went to  the soul of the spectator, and her well-instructed elocution satisfied  the most critical ear. It was then, also, that her father took the part  of \"Mercutio,\" for the first time. It is recorded that he earned by it  thirteen rounds of applause. Nor was its merit overrated. It was then,  and continued to be, a wonderful impersonation of the poetic-comic ideal.  On the 21st of the same month of October, the performers of Covent Garden  presented to Miss Kemble a gold bracelet as a testimony of the services  which she had rendered to the company by her performance of \"Juliet.\" It  was not until the 9th of December that she had to change her _role_. She  then performed Belvidera in \"Venice Preserved,\" and achieved another  triumph. For some time the part was alternated with that of \"Juliet.\" The  latter, during the season, was performed thirty-six times; the former,  twenty-three. The \"Grecian Daughter,\" and Mrs. Beverley, Portia in \"The  Merchant of Venice,\" Isabella, and Lady Townley, followed, and in all  she was eminently successful. Her season finished on the twenty-eighth  of May, and in it she performed altogether, one hundred and two times.  Her reputation, however, proved to be greater in the metropolis than in  the provinces. Nevertheless, on her return to London, she was greeted  with an enthusiastic reception. The next season was celebrated by the  failure of the \"Jew of Aragon,\" and the affair with Mr. Westmacott;  however, Miss Kemble added to her _repertoire_ the characters of Mrs.  Haller, Beatrice, Lady Constance, and Bianca in \"Fazio.\"    In 1832 she came with her father to the United States, where she played  with unprecedented success in the principal cities, confirming the  reputation she had acquired, of being the greatest British actress of the  age. While here she published her dramas, \"The Star of Seville\" and  \"Francis the First,\" and at this period she was a frequent contributor  to the literary journals,--many of her best fugitive poems having  appeared in the old \"New York Mirror.\"    In 1834 she retired from the stage, and was married to Mr. Pierce Butler  of Philadelphia, a gentleman of fortune, accomplishments, and an  honorable character. The history of this union is sufficiently notorious.  On both sides there was ambition: it was a distinction to be accepted by  a woman of so much genius; it was a great happiness to change the  dominion of a spendthrift and sometimes tyrannical father for that of a  rich and indulgent husband. But a woman accustomed to the applause of the  theater never yet was content with the repose of domestic life, and she  was of all her sex the most ill-fitted by nature for such an existence.  Her second resort to the stage in 1847, her fortunes at Manchester and in  London, her return to America, her public readings of Shakspeare here,  her divorce, and the very curious and unexplained circumstance of her  translation of a profligate French play, and disposal of it as a piece of  her own original composition, are all matters of too late occurrence to  need recapitulation.    She is a woman of masculine abilities, tastes, and energies; fitted  better for the camp than for the drawing-room, and often evincing a  degree of discontent that she is not a man. She always _acts_, and has  seldom, except when on the stage, the tact or ability even to seem  natural. Her equestrian exhibitions in Boston and New York, during her  more recent visits, illustrated the quality of her aspirations. Every  day, at a particular hour, so that a crowd might assemble to look upon  the performance, her horse was brought to the front of her hotel, and  when mounted, with affected difficulty, made to rear and pitch as if he  never before had felt the saddle or bit, and then to dash off as if upon  a race-course or to escape an avalanche.

You remember, I told you this flow, which we call the menstrual flow,  was the sign of the possibility of motherhood, so every girl should  be glad of the fact that she menstruates and should take good care of  herself at that time. She should pay especial attention to cleanliness  during this period. She should be provided with a circular girdle of  some strong material cut upon the bias, so it may be elastic, and  provided with tabs to which to pin the folded cloth. She also should  have a supply of sanitary cloths made of absorbent cotton fabric,  or pads made of absorbent-cotton enclosed in gauze. The latter are  especially convenient for the girl who is obliged to room away from  home, for they may be burned, and the cost of new ones is no greater  than the laundry of cloths. These pads or cloths should be changed  at least twice a day. It also is necessary that one should bathe the  parts in warm water with each change, as unpleasant odors can thereby  be avoided. At the close of each period she should take a bath and  change all clothing. One cannot be too careful about these matters,  so essential to cleanliness and health.    During this period, girls naturally have a feeling of lassitude or  disinclination to do any great mental or physical work, accompanied,  perhaps, by a slight feeling of uneasiness in the pelvic region (the  part of the body that contains the womb and ovaries). Because so many  do suffer at this time, it often is considered \"natural\" and allowed  to continue, but now that you know so much about the body you will  understand that it is not necessary to have any pains at this period.  If there is pain, it shows that we are not taking proper care of  ourselves. Even our stomach will give us severe pain if we do not  take proper care of it or if we overload it.    The monthly discharge varies in quantity with the individual. Usually  fleshy girls flow more than thin ones, and dark complexioned girls than  light ones. The discharge lasts about four days, and is the only symptom  that many girls experience in menstruation. This usually is the case  with those who are well and whose lives are happily employed.    I wanted you to know all these things, Violet, for sometimes when little  girls do not understand what this flow means they are frightened when  they see the blood. Some women even dread motherhood because they do not  know what to expect at that time nor how to care for themselves. All  women naturally love babies and if taught correctly would want to have  them. If they do not, it usually is because they have known of other  women suffering through ignorance and are afraid. If they would learn  more about these wonderful bodies of ours and more about the care of  little babies, they would understand how to care for themselves so as  to have healthy, happy babies. Not only that but they would see it was  the natural and the best thing for them to have children. In any work  we undertake, in everything we do, there is a possibility of an accident.  So it is in motherhood. A woman in normal health whose home life is  congenial, who loves children and who desires to have one, never should  have any serious trouble nor great pain. Painless childbirth is a  possibility if women only understood the care of themselves.    The modern athletic girl glories in her strength. She feels it a  disgrace to be a frail flower that cannot enter into the best enjoyment  of life. She glories in her strong, well-trained body. She walks with  free yet graceful step, holding her head high, for she knows she is  queen of her kingdom--her body. Her lungs are well developed and her  body well cared for, so she has no fear of disease. But the modern girl  does not stop there. She wants to have healthy sexual organs with room  for development of the babe, and strong muscles to perform their work in  expelling the babe. So she discards clothing that restricts her organs.  She wears comfortable, well-fitting clothes. The old-fashioned corsets  pushed the organs out of place, but the modern ones, made to conform to  nature's lines, serve only as a support. As nature did not make a waist  line, the one-piece dresses are especially desirable. Besides developing  every organ and muscle of her body and training her mind, the modern  girl goes to a training school to prepare for the mother calling.  Recently, in a few schools, a course of study has been provided for  the girls in the care of children, hygiene and nursing. Even women who  never become mothers themselves in this way learn general principles of  psychology, hygiene and the care of the sick that they might make use of  in every station of life. I hope, Violet, that after a while you will be  able to learn many of these things, so that when you are a grown woman  and the time comes for you to marry and have a baby you will know just  how to care for it.                 *       *       *       *       *      Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body. As by the one,    health is preserved, strengthened, and invigorated; by the other,    virtue (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cherished,    and confirmed.      Addison.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VI    BUILDING THE NEST      Now that I have told you so many things about the mother-nest,  especially about how it is growing all the time, I must tell you more  about the many helpers you have who assist in its growth. This they do  by providing it with food and by carrying away the waste material. We  found the body was composed of many parts or organs, each one of which  had its own especial work to do. If any one organ could not perform its  work, some other one would have to assist it, but, although the organs  are willing to help each other, it would not be fair to make one do  more than its share of work, except for a short time.    You remember, the stomach had a great deal of work to do in digesting  the food or preparing it so it could be taken up by the blood and  carried to the womb and all parts of the body. But the stomach does not  have to do this all alone. It has several helpers. One set of helpers is  the teeth, which cut and grind the food into small particles. In order  to do this, they must be kept in very good condition; otherwise, they  could not do their work. You know if your mother would let the kitchen  knives get dull or rusty, she would be unable to cut the bread, meat and  other food materials with them. The same is true of the teeth. We can  keep them in good condition by brushing them. It is as important to do  this as to wash the dishes. Then, too, we must be careful not to break  the teeth by biting nuts and other hard things. Nothing so detracts from  a girl's appearance and nothing is more conducive to indigestion than  poorly cared for teeth. They should be brushed at least twice daily and  the mouth afterwards rinsed with a mild antiseptic solution. The teeth  should be thoroughly examined by a good dentist at least every six  months.    Another assistant that the stomach has is the intestines or bowels,  which not only help to digest the food but also carry off the waste  material. The bowels are very good, and will tell us when they have  waste material to be disposed of, but sometimes people are too busy and  do not pay attention. If we neglect them many times the bowels get tired  of telling us, and then their work is not done. We think they are lazy  and so we try to whip them up by taking a laxative. This seems to help  at first, but we soon find we have to do the same thing every day.  All this time the fault was our own, for we did not understand. The  best way is to have a regular time of going to the toilet, say, right  after breakfast. If we always go at the same time the bowels will  remember it. Then we need have no trouble with constipation nor take any  horrid medicine to whip the bowels. A regular daily action of the bowels  is necessary to health. Constipation often may be relieved by drinking  a glass of cold water upon rising, at intervals during the day, and  upon retiring. Fruit at breakfast or figs taken after meals often will  relieve a tendency to constipation. Regularity in going to the toilet is  one of the most important measures in treating constipation. Laxatives  or cathartics should not be taken except for an occasional dose or  during illness, upon the advice of a physician. So common is the  practice of taking daily laxatives that it has become a \"national  curse.\" People do not realize that they are slaves to this habit. So  cleverly worded are the advertisements of many of the laxatives that  people are led to believe that if they drink certain \"waters\" or \"teas\"  they are avoiding medicine, while often these same teas and waters  contain drugs more powerful and harmful than any pill.    The bowels have some one to assist them, too, for the kidneys carry off  much of the waste material of the body. Indeed, they carry off so much  that they sometimes are called the sewers. It often is necessary to  flush the sewers of the city, that is, to send quantities of water  through them to clean the system. In the same way it is necessary to  flush the kidneys. We do this by drinking plenty of water. Every one  should drink about two quarts of water a day.    There is another worker that helps both the kidneys and the bowels.  This is the skin, which sends off waste material through the tiny pores  or openings. If dirt accumulates on the skin, it clogs the pores so the  skin cannot use them. So you see how necessary it is to take frequent  baths to keep the pores open.    Other helpers that carry some of the waste material from the body are  the lungs, which send out the impure air. The lungs also take in the  pure air, which, you remember, helps to make the red coloring"]]]
