She did not know that  this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she  did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people  were, but she did not know that she was so herself.    She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen,  with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When  the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked  through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying  to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to  seem to belong to her. It would have made her very angry to think people  imagined she was her little girl.    But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts.  She was the kind of woman who would \"stand no nonsense from young ones.\"  At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. She  had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter was  going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as  housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could  keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. She  never dared even to ask a question.    \"Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,\" Mr. Craven had said  in his short, cold way. \"Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I am  their daughter's guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must go  to London and bring her yourself.\"    So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.    Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and  fretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her  thin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her look  yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her  black crepe hat.    \"A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,\" Mrs. Medlock  thought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) She  had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at  last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard  voice.    \"I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going  to,\" she said. \"Do you know anything about your uncle?\"    \"No,\" said Mary.    \"Never heard your father and mother talk about him?\"    \"No,\" said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that her  father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.  Certainly they had never told her things.    \"Humph,\" muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive  little face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then she  began again.    \"I suppose you might as well be told something--to prepare you. You are  going to a queer place.\"    Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by  her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.    \"Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven's  proud of it in his way--and that's gloomy enough, too. The house is six  hundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near a  hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked. And  there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for  ages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees with  branches trailing to the ground--some of them.\" She paused and took  another breath. \"But there's nothing else,\" she ended suddenly.    Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlike  India, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend to  look as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy,  disagreeable ways. So she sat still.    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"What do you think of it?\"    \"Nothing,\" she answered. \"I know nothing about such places.\"    That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.    \"Eh!\" she said, \"but you are like an old woman. Don't you care?\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said Mary, \"whether I care or not.\"    \"You are right enough there,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"It doesn't. What  you're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unless  because it's the easiest way. _He's_ not going to trouble himself about  you, that's sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.\"    She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.    \"He's got a crooked back,\" she said. \"That set him wrong. He was a sour  young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was  married.\"    Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to  care. She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she was  a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative  woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing some  of the time, at any rate.    \"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over to  get her a blade o' grass she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, but  she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she  didn't--she didn't,\" positively. \"When she died--\"    Mary gave a little involuntary jump.    \"Oh! did she die!\" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had just  remembered a French fairy story she had once read called \"Riquet a la  Houppe.\" It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and  it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.    \"Yes, she died,\" Mrs. Medlock answered. \"And it made him queerer than  ever. He cares about nobody. He won't see people. Most of the time he  goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the  West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him. Pitcher's an old  fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his  ways.\"    It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel  cheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with  their doors locked--a house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever a moor  was--sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!  She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it  seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in  gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the  pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being  something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to  parties as she had done in frocks \"full of lace.\" But she was not there  any more.    \"You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't,\" said Mrs.  Medlock. \"And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk to  you. You'll have to play about and look after yourself. You'll be told  what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There's  gardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering and  poking about. Mr. Craven won't have it.\"    \"I shall not want to go poking about,\" said sour little Mary; and just  as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven  she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to  deserve all that had happened to him.    And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the  railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if  it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily  that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell  asleep.          CHAPTER III    ACROSS THE MOOR      She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a  lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold  beef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be  streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore  wet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the  carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken  and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and  Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side  until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage,  lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quite  dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and  Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.    \"You have had a sleep!\" she said. \"It's time to open your eyes! We're at  Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.\"    Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock  collected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her,  because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and  it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.    The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be  getting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a  rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion  which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.    \"I see tha's got back,\" he said. \"An' tha's browt th' young 'un with  thee.\"    \"Aye, that's her,\" answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire  accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.  \"How's thy Missus?\"    \"Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.\"    A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary  saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who  helped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of  his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly  station-master included.    When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove  off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned  corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and  looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over  which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#3)"],[1,"account. I follow  up the best prospects and visit them in person. I've talked to fifty  horny-handed he-men in the past month.\"    \"Then I don't see what you need of anyone to bring up the drag,\" Andy  told her admiringly. \"If you talk to 'em, there oughtn't be any drag!\"    \"Thank you for the implied compliment. But there IS a 'drag,' as you  call it. There's going to be a big one, too, I'm afraid--when they get  out and see this tract we're going to work off this spring.\" She stopped  and studied him as a chess player studies the board.    \"I'm very much tempted to tell you something I shouldn't tell,\" she said  at length, lowering her voice a little. \"Remember, Andy Green was a very  good looking man, and his eyes were remarkable for their clear, candid  gaze straight into your own eyes. Even as keen a business woman as  Florence Grace Hallman must be forgiven for being deceived by them. I'm  tempted to tell you where this tract is. You may know it.\"    \"You better not, unless you're willing to take a chance,\" he told her  soberly. \"If it looks too good, I'm liable to jump it myself.\"    Miss Hallman laughed and twisted her red lips at him in what might be  construed as a flirtatious manner. She was really quite taken with Andy  Green. \"I'll take a chance. I don't think you'll jump it. Do you know  anything about Dry Lake, up above Havre, toward Great Falls--and the  country out east of there, towards the mountains?\"    The fingers of Andy Green closed into his palms. His eyes, however,  continued to look into hers with his most guileless expression.    \"Y-es--that is, I've ridden over it,\" he acknowledged simply.    \"Well--now this is a secret; at least we don't want those mossback  ranchers in there to get hold of it too soon, though they couldn't  really do anything, since it's all government land and the lease has  only just run out. There's a high tract lying between the Bear Paws  and--do you know where the Flying U ranch is?\"    \"About where it is--yes.\"    \"Well, it's right up there on that plateau--bench, you call it out here.  There are several thousand acres along in there that we're locating  settlers on this spring. We're just waiting for the grass to get nice  and green, and the prairie to get all covered with those blue, blue wind  flowers, and the meadow larks to get busy with their nests, and then  we're going to bring them out and--\" She spread her hands again. It  seemed a favorite gesture grown into a habit, and it surely was more  eloquent than words. \"These prairies will be a dream of beauty, in a  little while,\" she said. \"I'm to watch for the psychological time to  bring out the seekers. And if I could just interest you, Mr. Green, to  the extent of being somewhere around Dry Lake, with a good team that  you will drive for hire and some samples of oats and dry-land spuds and  stuff that you raised on your claim--\" She eyed him sharply for one so  endearingly feminine. \"Would you do it? There'd be a salary, and besides  that a commission on each doubter you landed. And I'd just love to have  you for one of my assistants.\"    \"It sure sounds good,\" Andy flirted with the proposition, and let his  eyes soften appreciably to meet her last sentence and the tone in which  she spoke it. \"Do you think I could get by with the right line of talk  with the doubters?\"    \"I think you could,\" she said, and in her voice there was a cooing  note. \"Study up a little on the right dope, and I think you could  convince--even me.\"    \"Could I?\" Andy Green knew that cooing note, himself, and one a shade  more provocative. \"I wonder!\"    A man came down the aisle at that moment, gave Andy a keen glance and  went on with a cigar between his fingers. Andy scowled frankly, sighed  and straightened his shoulders.    \"That's what I call hard luck,\" he grumbled, \"got to see that man before  he gets off the train--and the h--worst of it is, I don't know just what  station he'll get off at.\" He sighed again. \"I've got a deal on,\" he  told her confidentially, \"that's sure going to keep me humping if I pull  loose so as to go in with you. How long did you say?\"    \"Probably two weeks, the way spring is opening out here. I'd want you  to get perfectly familiar with our policy and the details of our scheme  before they land. I'd want you to be familiar with that tract and be  able to show up its best points when you take seekers out there. You'd  be so much better than one of our own men, who have the word 'agent'  written all over them. You'll come back and--talk it over won't you?\"  For Andy was showing unmistakable symptoms of leaving her to follow the  man.    \"You KNOW it,\" he declared in a tone of \"I won't sleep nights till this  thing is settled--and settled right.\" He gave her a smile that rather  dazzled the lady, got up with much reluctance and with a glance that had  in it a certain element of longing went swaying down the aisle after the  man who had preceded him.    Andy's business with the man consisted solely in mixing cigarette smoke  with cigar smoke and of helping to stare moodily out of the window.  Words there were none, save when Andy was proffered a match and muttered  his thanks. The silent session lasted for half an hour. Then the man got  up and went out, and the breath of Andy Green paused behind his nostrils  until he saw that the man went only to the first section in the car and  settled there behind a spread newspaper, invisible to Florence Grace  Hallman unless she searched the car and peered over the top of the paper  to see who was behind.    After that Andy Green continued to stare out of the window, seeing  nothing of the scenery but the flicker of telegraph posts before his  eyes that were visioning the future.    The Flying U ranch hemmed in by homesteaders from the East, he saw;  homesteaders who were being urged to bring all the stock they could, and  turn it loose upon the shrinking range. Homesteaders who would fence  the country into squares, and tear up the grass and sow grain that might  never bear a harvest. Homesteaders who would inevitably grow poorer upon  the land that would suck their strength and all their little savings  and turn them loose finally to forage a living where they might.  Homesteaders who would ruin the land that ruined them.... It was not a  pleasing picture, but it was more pleasing than the picture he saw of  the Flying U after these human grass hoppers had settled there.    The range that fed the Flying U stock would feed no more and hide their  ribs at shipping time. That he knew too well. Old J. G. Whitmore and  Chip would have to sell out. And that was like death; indeed, it IS  death of a sort, when one of the old outfits is wiped out of existence.  It had happened before--happened too often to make pleasant memories for  Andy Green, who could name outfit after outfit that had been forced out  of business by the settling of the range land; who could name dozens  of cattle brands once seen upon the range, and never glimpsed now from  spring roundup until fall.    Must the Flying U brand disappear also? The good old Flying U, for whose  existence the Old Man had fought and schemed since first was raised the  cry that the old range was passing? The Flying U that had become a part  of his life? Andy let his cigarette grow cold; he roused only to swear  at the porter who entered with dust cloth and a deprecating grin.    After that, Andy thought of Florence Grace Hallman--and his eyes were  not particularly sentimental. There was a hard line about his mouth  also; though Florence Grace Hallman was but a pawn in the game, after  all, and not personally guilty of half the deliberate crimes Andy laid  upon her dimpled shoulders. With her it was pure, cold-blooded business,  this luring of the land-hungry to a land whose fertility was at best  problematical; who would, for a price, turn loose the victims of her  greed to devastate what little grazing ground was left.    The train neared Havre. Andy roused himself, rang for the porter and  sent him after his suitcase and coat. Then he sauntered down the aisle,  stopped beside Florence Grace Hallman and smiled down at her with a  gleam behind the clear candor of his eyes.    \"Hard luck, lady,\" he murmured, leaning toward her. \"I'm just simply  loaded to the guards with responsibilities, and here's where I get off.  But I'm sure glad I met yuh, and I'll certainly think day and night  about you and--all you told me about. I'd like to get in on this land  deal. Fact is, I'm going to make it my business to get in on it. Maybe  my way of working won't suit you--but I'll sure work hard for any boss  and do the best I know how.\"    \"I think that will suit me,\" Miss Hallman assured him, and smiled  unsuspectingly up into his eyes, which she thought she could read so  easily. \"When shall I see you again? Could you come to Great Falls in  the next ten days? I shall be stopping at the Park. Or if you will leave  me your address--\"    \"No use. I'll be on the move and a letter wouldn't get me. I'll see yuh  later, anyway. I'm bound to. And when I do, we'll get down to cases.  Good bye.\"    He was turning away when Miss Hallman put out a soft, jewelled hand.  She thought it was diffidence that made Andy Green hesitate perceptibly  before he took it. She thought it was simply a masculine shyness and  confusion that made him clasp her fingers loosely and let them go on the  instant. She did not see him rub his palm down the leg of his dark gray  trousers as he walked down the aisle, and if she had she would not have  seen any significance in the movement.    Andy Green did that again before he stepped off the train. For he felt  that he had shaken hands with a traitor to himself and his outfit, and  it went against the grain. That the traitor was a woman, and a charming  woman at that, only intensified his resentment against her. A man can  fight a man and keep his self respect; but a man does mortally dread  being "]]]
