The plan which had been proposed, and which had been accepted by the  majority, had been evolved from the wisdom of past eternities. It had  exalted worlds before. It had been proved wise and just. It was founded  on correct principles. By it only could the spiritual creation go on in  its evolution to greater and to higher things. It was the will of the  Father, to whom they all owed their existence as progressive, spiritual  organizations. To bow to Him was no humiliation. To honor and obey Him  was their duty. To follow the First Born, Him whom the Father had chosen  as mediator, was no more than a Father should request. Any other plan  would lead to confusion. Thus reasoned the followers of Christ.    Then there were others, not valiant in either cause, who stood on  neutral ground. Without strength of character to come out boldly, they  aided neither the right nor the wrong. Weak-minded as they were, they  could not be trusted, nor could Lucifer win them over.    Meanwhile, the earth, rolling in space, evolved from its chaotic state,  and in time became a fit abode for the higher creations of God.    Then the crisis came. The edict went forth that for many of the sons and  daughters of God the first estate was about to end, and that the second  would be ushered in. Lucifer had now won over many of the hosts of  heaven. These had failed to keep their first estate. Now there would be  a separation.    A council was convened, and the leading spirits were summoned. All  waited for the outcome in silent awe.    Then came the decision, spoken with heavenly authority:    \"Ye valiant and loyal sons and daughters of God, blessed are ye for your  righteousness and your faithfulness to God and His cause. Your reward is  that ye shall be permitted to dwell on the new earth, and in tabernacles  of flesh continue in the eternal course of progress, as has been marked  out and explained to you.\"    Then, to the still defiant forms of Lucifer and his adherents this was  said:    \"Lucifer, son of the morning, thou hast withdrawn from the Father many  of the children of heaven. They have their agency, and have chosen to  believe thy lies. They have fallen with thee from before the face of  God. Thus hast thou used the power given thee. Thou hast said in thy  heart, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.... I will be like  the Most High! Thou hast sought to usurp power, to take a kingdom that  does not belong to thee. God holds you all as in the hollow of His hand;  yet He has not restrained thine agency. He has been patient and  longsuffering with you. Rebellious children of heaven, the Father's  bosom heaves with sorrow for you; but justice claims its own--your  punishment is that you be cast out of heaven. Bodies of flesh and bones  ye shall not have; but ye shall wander without tabernacles over the face  of the earth. Ye shall be 'reserved in everlasting chains under darkness  unto the judgment of the great day.'\"    Thus went forth the decree of the Almighty, and with it the force of His  power. Lucifer and many of the hosts of heaven were cast down. The whole  realm was thrilled with the power of God. The celestial elements were  stirred to their depths. Heaven wept over the fallen spirits, and the  cry went out, \"Lo, lo, he is fallen, even the Son of the Morning.\"          III.      \"For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\"--_John    17:24._      There was a calm in heaven like unto that of a summer morning after a  night of storm.    Throughout the whole strife, the dark clouds of evil had been gathering.  In the fierce struggle, the spirits of heaven had been storm-tossed as  on two contending waves; but when Lucifer and his forces were cast out,  the atmosphere became purged of its uncleanness, and a sweet peace  brooded over all. Save for sorrow for the lost ones, nothing marred the  perfect joy of heaven. All now looked forward to the consummation of  that plan whereby they would become inhabitants of another world, fitted  for their school of experience in the flesh. All prepared themselves  with this end in view.    None was more grateful to his Father than Homan. In the midst of the  strife, he had done what he could for what he thought was right. All his  influence had been used with the wavering ones, and many were those who  owed him a debt of gratitude. But his greatest reward was in the peace  which dwelt within him and the joy with which he was greeted by all who  knew him.    Through it all, Homan's thoughts had often been with the fair sister  Delsa; and often he had sought her and talked with her. It pleased him  greatly to see the earnestness and energy with which she defended the  cause of the Father. He was drawn to her more than to the many others  who were equally valiant. As he thought of it, its strangeness occurred  to him. Why should it be so? He did not know. Delsa was fair; so were  all the daughters of God. She had attained to great intelligence; so had  thousands of others. Then wherein lay the secret of the power which drew  him to her?    The vastness of the spiritual world held enough for study, research, and  for occupation. None needed to be idle, for there were duties to be  performed, as much here as in any other sphere of action. In the  Father's house are many mansions.    In the one where Delsa lived, she and Homan sat in earnest conversation.  Through the opening leading to the garden appeared the stately form of  Sardus. Homan sprang to meet him and greeted him joyously:    \"Welcome, Brother Sardus, welcome!\"    Delsa arose.    \"This is Brother Sardus,\" said Homan, \"and this is Sister Delsa.\"    \"Welcome, brother,\" said she. \"Come and sit with us.\"    \"Sardus,\" continued Homan, \"I thought you lost. I have not met you for a  long time. You remember our last conversation? Sardus, what joy to know  that you are on the safe side, that you did not fall with Lucifer--\"    \"S--h, that name. Dear brother, he tempted me sorely, but I overcame  him.\"    \"But we are shortly to meet him on new ground,\" continued Homan. \"As  seducing spirits, he and his followers will still fight against the  anointed Son. They will not yield. Not obtaining bodies themselves, they  will seek to operate through those of others.\"    \"Now we know how temptation and sin will come into the world,\" said  Delsa. \"God grant that we may overcome these dangers again, as we once  have done.\"    They conversed for some time; then Sardus departed to perform some duty.    \"I, too, must go,\" said Delsa. \"A company of sisters is soon to leave  for earth, and I am going to say farewell to them.\"    \"Delsa, you do not go with them? You are not leaving me?\"    \"No, Homan, my time is not yet.\"    \"May we not go together?--but there--that is as Father wills. He will  ordain for the best. There are nations yet to go to the earth, and we  shall have our allotted time and place.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A group of persons was engaged in earnest conversation, when a messenger  approached. He raised his hand for silence, and then announced:    \"I come from the Father on an errand to you.\"    The company gave him close attention, and he continued: \"It is  pertaining to some of our brothers and sisters who have gone before us  into earth-life. I shall have to tell you about them so that you may  understand. A certain family of earth-children has fallen into evil  ways. Not being very strong for the truth before they left us, their  experiences in the other world have not made them stronger. This family,  it seems, has become rooted in false doctrine and wrong living, so that  those who come to them from us partake also of their error and unbelief  of the truth. As you know, kinship and environment are powerful agencies  in forming character, and it appears that none of the Father's children  have so far been able to withstand the tendency to wrong which is  exerted on all who come to this family.\"    The messenger paused and looked around on the listening group. Then he  continued: \"The Father bids me ask if any of you are willing to go in  earth-life to this family, become kin to those weak-hearted ones--for  their salvation.\"    There was a long pause as if all were considering the proposition. The  messenger waited.    \"Brother,\" asked one, \"is there not danger that he who goes on this  mission might himself come under the influence you speak of to such an  extent that he also would be lost to the good, and thus make a failure  of his mission?\"    \"In the earth-life, as here,\" replied the messenger, \"all have their  agency. It is, therefore, possible that those who take upon themselves  this mission--for there must be two, male and female--to give way to the  power of evil, and thus fail in their errand. But, consider this: the  Father has sent me to you. He knows you, your hearts, your faithfulness,  your strength. He knows whom He is asking to go into danger for the sake  of saving souls. Yes, friends, the Father knows, and this ought to be  enough for you.\"    The listeners bowed their heads as if ashamed of the doubting, fearful  thought. Then in the stillness, one spoke as if to herself: \"To be a  savior,--to share in the work of our Elder Brother! O, think of it!\"  Then the speaker raised her head quickly. \"May I go, may I?\" she  questioned eagerly.    \"And I,\" \"and I,\" came from others.    \"Sister, you will do for one,\" said the messenger to her who had first  spoken. \"And now, we need a brother--yes, you, brother, will do.\" This  to one who was pressing forward, asking to be chosen.    \"Yes, yes,\" continued the messenger, as he smiled his pleasure on the  company, \"I see that the Father knows you all.\"    \"But,\" faltered the sister who had been chosen, \"what are we to do? May  we not know?\"    \"Not wholly,\" was the reply. \"Do you not remember what you have been  taught, that a veil is drawn over the eyes of all who enter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#3)"],[1,"boiling point, and one week later, having been commissioned  as lieutenant and assigned to the sloop of war _Mississippi_, he hurried  thither to help in defence of the Union.    The _Mississippi_ was a sidewheel steamer, carrying seventeen guns, and  was destined to a thrilling career in the stirring operations of the  West Gulf squadron, under the command of Captain David Glasgow Farragut,  the greatest naval hero produced by the Civil War, and without a  superior in all history.          CHAPTER II.    DEWEY IN THE WAR FOR THE UNION.      No one needs to be reminded that the War for the Union was the greatest  struggle of modern times. The task of bringing back to their allegiance  those who had risen against the authority of the National Government was  a gigantic one, and taxed the courage and resources of the country to  the utmost. In order to make the war effective, it was necessary to  enforce a rigorous blockade over three thousand miles of seacoast, open  the Mississippi river, and overcome the large and well-officered armies  in the field. The last was committed to the land forces, and it proved  an exhausting and wearying struggle.    Among the most important steps was the second--that of opening the  Mississippi, which being accomplished, the Southwest, from which the  Confederacy drew its immense supplies of cattle, would be cut off and a  serious blow struck against the armed rebellion.    The river was sealed from Vicksburg to the Gulf of Mexico. At the former  place extensive batteries had been erected and were defended by an army,  while the river below bristled with batteries and guns in charge of  brave men and skilful officers.    While General Grant undertook the task of reducing Vicksburg, Captain  Farragut assumed the herculean work of forcing his way up the  Mississippi and capturing New Orleans, the greatest commercial city in  the South. Knowing that such an attack was certain to be made, the  Confederates had neglected no precaution in the way of defence. Ninety  miles below the city, and twenty miles above its mouth, at the  Plaquemine Bend, were the forts of St. Philip and Jackson. The former,  on the left bank, had forty-two heavy guns, including two mortars and a  battery of four seacoast mortars, placed below the water battery. Fort  Jackson, besides its water battery, mounted sixty-two guns, while above  the forts were fourteen vessels, including the ironclad ram _Manassas_,  and a partially completed floating battery, armored with railroad iron  and called the _Louisiana_. New Orleans was defended by three thousand  volunteers, most of the troops formerly there having been sent to the  Confederate army in Tennessee.    The expedition against New Orleans was prepared with great care, and so  many months were occupied that the enemy had all the notice they could  ask in which to complete their preparations for its defence. The Union  expedition consisted of six sloops of war, sixteen gunboats, twenty  mortar schooners and five other vessels. The _Mississippi_, upon which  young Dewey was serving as a lieutenant, was under the command of  Melanethon Smith. The land troops numbered 15,000, and were in charge of  General Benjamin F. Butler, of Massachusetts.    Farragut arrived in February, 1862, nearly two months after the  beginning of preparations to force the river. When everything was in  readiness the fleet moved cautiously up stream, on April 18, and a  bombardment of Forts St. Philip and Jackson was opened, which lasted for  three days, without accomplishing anything decisive. Farragut had  carefully studied the situation, and, confident that the passage could  be made, determined it should be done, no matter at what cost. On the  night of the 23d his vessels were stripped of every rope and spar that  could be spared, the masts and rigging of the gunboats and mortar  vessels being trimmed with the limbs of trees, to conceal their identity  from the Confederate watchers.    At two o'clock in the morning the signal was hoisted on the _Hartford_,  Captain Farragut's flagship, and the fleet started in single line to run  the fearful gauntlet. The _Cayuga_ led, the _Pensacola_ followed, and  the _Mississippi_ was third. The rebels had huge bonfires burning on  both shores, and as the _Pensacola_ came opposite the forts they opened  their furious fire upon her.    A good deal of uneasiness prevailed in the Union fleet regarding the  rebel rams. It was known they were formidable monsters, which the  Confederates believed could smash and sink the whole Union squadron.  While it was known that much was to be feared from the forts, it was the  ironclads that formed the uncertain factor and magnified the real danger  in many men's minds.    The _Mississippi_ was hardly abreast of Fort St. Philip when the dreaded  _Manassas_ came plunging down the river out of the gloom at full speed,  and headed directly for the _Mississippi._ She was not seen until so  close that it was impossible to dodge her, and the ironclad struck the  steamer on the port side, close to the mizzenmast, firing a gun at the  same time. Fortunately the blow was a glancing one, though it opened a  rent seven feet long and four inches deep in the steamer, which, being  caught by the swift current on her starboard bow, was swept across to  the Fort Jackson side of the river, so close indeed that her gunners and  those in the fort exchanged curses and imprecations.    [Illustration: SHELLING FORTS PHILIP AND JACKSON.]    The passage of the forts by the Union vessels forms one of the most  thrilling pictures in the history of the Civil War. The _Hartford_, like  all the vessels, was subjected to a terrible fire, was assailed by the  Confederate ironclads, and more than once was in imminent danger of  being sent to the bottom. Following with the second division, Captain  Farragut did not reply to the fire of the forts for a quarter of an  hour. He hurled a broadside into St. Philip and was pushing through the  dense smoke when a fire-raft, with a tug pushing her along, plunged out  of the gloom toward the _Hartford's_ port quarter. She swerved to elude  this peril and ran aground close to St. Philip, which, recognizing her  three ensigns and flag officer's flag, opened a savage fire, but luckily  most of the shot passed too high.    There was no getting out of the way of the fire-raft, which, being  jammed against the flagship, sent the flames through the portholes and  up the oiled masts. The perfect discipline of the crew enabled them to  extinguish the fire before it could do much damage, and the _Hartford_  succeeded in backing into deep water and kept pounding Fort St. Philip  so long as she was in range.    Without attempting to describe the battle in detail, we will give our  attention to the _Mississippi_. Within an hour and a quarter of the  time the leading vessel passed the forts, all had reached a safe point  above, where they engaged in a furious fight with the Confederate  flotilla, the smaller members of which were soon disabled or sunk.    [Illustration: THE \"HARTFORD\"--FARRAGUT'S FLAGSHIP.]    Meanwhile the ironclad _Manassas_ had been prowling at the heels of the  Union squadron, but being discovered by the _Mississippi_, the steamer  opened on her with so destructive a fire that the ram ran ashore and the  crew scrambled over the bows and escaped. The _Mississippi_ continued  pounding her until she was completely wrecked. The loss of the Union  fleet was thirty-seven killed and one hundred and forty-seven wounded,  while the Confederate land forces had twelve killed and forty wounded.  The Confederate flotilla must have lost as many men as the Unionists.  Having safely passed all obstructions, Captain Farragut steamed up to  the river to New Orleans, and the city surrendered April 25, formal  possession being taken on May 1.    It will be admitted that Lieutenant Dewey had received his \"baptism of  fire.\"    It is the testimony of every one who saw him during the turmoil of  battle that he conducted himself with the coolness and courage of a  veteran. At no time during the passage of the forts and the desperate  fighting with the Confederate flotilla above did he display the first  evidence of nervousness or lack of self-possession.    [Illustration: IRONCLADS ON THE MISSISSIPPI.]    The next engagement in which Lieutenant Dewey took part was the attempt  by Farragut to pass the battery of nineteen guns, mounted on the  hundred-foot high bluff of Port Hudson, on a bend of the Mississippi,  below Vicksburg. The position was the most difficult conceivable to  carry from the river, because of the plunging shots from the enormous  guns on the bluff above.    Captain Farragut had no thought of reducing these batteries, which would  have been impossible with a fleet double the strength of his, but he  wished to get his vessels past in order to blockade the river above the  bend. The attempt was made on the night of March 14, 1863, with the  _Hartford_ in the lead, and followed by the _Richmond_, _Monongahela_  and _Mississippi_, with the smaller boats. The first three boats had as  consorts the _Albatross_, _Kineo_ and _Genessee_. Captain Mahan, in \"The  Gulf and Inland Waters,\" gives the following vivid description of this  historical incident:    \"As they drew near the batteries, the lowest of which the _Hartford_ had  already passed, the enemy threw up rockets and opened their fire.  Prudence, and the fact of the best water being on the starboard hand,  led the ships to hug the east shore of the river, passing so close under  the Confederate guns that the speech of the gunners and troops could be  distinguished. Along the shore, at the foot of the bluffs, powerful  reflecting lamps, like those used on locomotives, had been placed to  show the ships to the enemy as they passed, and for the same purpose  large fires, already stacked on the opposite point, were lit. The fire  of the fleet and from the "]]]
