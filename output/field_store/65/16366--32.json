He arrived at the cantonment of Dinapore, near  Patna, on the 20th December, and on Christmas Day began his military  career as a cadet. He at once applied himself with exemplary  diligence to the study of the Arabic and Persian languages, and of  the religions and customs of India. Passing in due course through the  ordinary early stages of military life, he was promoted to the rank  of ensign on the 23rd September, 1810, and to that of lieutenant on  the 16th December, 1814.    Lieutenant Sleeman served in the war with Nepal, which began in 1814  and terminated in 1816. During the campaign he narrowly escaped death  from a violent epidemic fever, which nearly destroyed his regiment.  'Three hundred of my own regiment,' he observes, 'consisting of about  seven hundred, were obliged to be sent to their homes on sick leave.  The greater number of those who remained continued to suffer, and a  great many died. Of about ten European officers present with my  regiment, seven had the fever and five died of it, almost all in a  state of delirium. I was myself one of the two who survived, and I  was for many days delirious.[1]    The services of Lieutenant Sleeman during the war attracted  attention, and accordingly, in 1816, he was selected to report on  certain claims to prize-money. The report submitted by him in  February, 1817, was accepted as 'able, impartial, and satisfactory'.  After the termination of the war he served with his regiment at  Allahabad, and in the neighbouring district of Partabgarh, where he  laid the foundation of the intimate knowledge of Oudh affairs  displayed in his later writings.    In 1820 he was selected for civil employ, and was appointed Junior  Assistant to the Agent of the Governor-General, administering the  Sagar and Nerbudda territories. Those territories, which had been  annexed from the Marathas two years previously, are now included in  the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces.  In such a recently-conquered country, where the sale of all widows by  auction for the benefit of the Treasury, and other strange customs  still prevailed, the abilities of an able and zealous young officer  had ample scope. Sleeman, after a brief apprenticeship, received, in  1822, the independent civil charge of the District of Narsinghpur, in  the Nerbudda valley, and there, for more than two years, 'by far the  most laborious of his life', his whole attention was engrossed in  preventing and remedying the disorders of his District.    Sleeman, during the time that he was in charge of the Narsinghpur  District, had no suspicion that it was a favourite resort of Thugs. A  few years later, in or about 1830, he was astounded to learn that a  gang of Thugs resided in the village of Kandeli, not four hundred  yards from his court-house, and that the extensive groves of Mandesar  on the Sagar road, only one stage distant from his head-quarters,  concealed one of the greatest _bhils_, or places of murder, in all  India. The arrest of Feringheea, one of the most influential Thug  leaders, having given the key to the secret, his disclosures were  followed up by Sleeman with consummate skill and untiring assiduity.  In the years 1831 and 1832 the reports submitted by him and other  officers at last opened the eyes of the superior authorities and  forced them to recognize the fact that the murderous organization  extended over every part of India. Adequate measures were then taken  for the systematic suppression of the evil. 'Thuggee Sleeman' made it  the main business of his life to hunt down the criminals and to  extirpate their secret society. He recorded his experiences in the  series of valuable publications described in the Bibliography. In  this brief memoir it is impossible to narrate in detail the thrilling  story of the suppression of Thuggee, and I must be content to pass on  and give in bare outline the main facts of Sleeman's honourable  career.[2]    While at Narsinghpur, Sleeman received on the 24th April, 1824,  brevet rank as Captain. In 1825, he was transferred, and on the 23rd  September of the following year, was gazetted Captain. In 1826,  failure of health compelled him to take leave on medical certificate.  In March, 1828, Captain Sleeman assumed civil and executive charge of  the Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, from which he was transferred to  Sagar in January, 1831. While stationed at Jabalpur, he married, on  the 21st June, 1829, Amelie Josephine, the daughter of Count Blondin  de Fontenne, a French nobleman, who, at the sacrifice of a  considerable property, had managed to escape from the Revolution. A  lady informs the editor that she remembers Sleeman's fine house at  Jabalpur. It stood in a large walled park, stocked with spotted deer.  Both house and park were destroyed when the railway was carried  through the site.    Mr. C. Eraser, on return from leave in January, 1832, resumed charge  of the revenue and civil duties of the Sagar district, leaving the  magisterial duties to Captain Sleeman, who continued to discharge  them till January, 1835. By the Resolution of Government dated 10th  January, 1835, Captain Sleeman was directed to fix his head-quarters  at Jabalpur, and was appointed General Superintendent of the  operations for the Suppression of Thuggee, being relieved from every  other charge. In 1835 his health again broke down, and he was obliged  to take leave on medical certificate. Accompanied by his wife and  little son, he went into camp in November, 1835, and marched through  the Jabalpur, Damoh, and Sagar districts of the Agency, and then  through the Native States of Orchha, Datiya, and Gwalior, arriving at  Agra on the 1st January, 1836. After a brief halt at Agra, he  proceeded through the Bharatpur State to Delhi and Meerut, and thence  on leave to Simla. During his march from Jabalpur to Meerut he amused  himself by keeping the journal which forms the basis of the _Rambles  and Recollections of an Indian Official_. The manuscript of this work  (except the two supplementary chapters) was completed in 1839, though  not given to the world till 1844. On the 1st of February, 1837, in  the twenty-eighth year of his service, Sleeman was gazetted Major.  During the same year he made a tour in the interior of the Himalayas,  which he described at length in an unpublished journal. Later in the  year he went down to Calcutta to see his boy started on the voyage  home.    In February, 1839, he assumed charge of the office of Commissioner  for the Suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity. Up to that date the  office of Commissioner for the Suppression of Dacoity had been  separate from that of General Superintendent of the measures for the  Suppression of Thuggee, and had been filled by another officer, Mr.  Hugh Eraser, of the Civil Service. During the next two years Sleeman  passed much of his time in the North-Western Provinces, now the Agra  Province in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, making Muradabad  his head-quarters, and thoroughly investigating the secret criminal  organizations of Upper India.    In 1841 he was offered the coveted and lucrative post of Resident at  Lucknow, vacant by the resignation of Colonel Low; but that officer,  immediately after his resignation, lost all his savings through the  failure of his bankers, and Sleeman, moved by a generous impulse,  wrote to Colonel Low, begging him to retain the appointment.    Sleeman was then deputed on special duty to Bundelkhand to  investigate the grave disorders in that province. While at Jhansi in  December, 1842, he narrowly escaped assassination by a dismissed  Afghan sepoy, who poured the contents of a blunderbuss into a native  officer in attendance.[3]    During the troubles with Sindhia which culminated in the battle of  Maharajpur, fought on the 29th December, 1843, Sleeman, who had  become a Lieut.-Colonel, was Resident at Gwalior, and was actually in  Sindhia's camp when the battle unexpectedly began. In 1848 the  Residency at Lucknow again fell vacant, and Lord Dalhousie, by a  letter dated 16th September, offered Sleeman the appointment in the  following terms:     The high reputation you have earned, your experience of civil  administration, your knowledge of the people, and the qualifications  you possess as a public man, have led me to submit your name to the  Council of India as an officer to whom I could commit this important  charge with entire confidence that its duties would be well  performed. I do myself, therefore, the honour of proposing to you to  accept the office of Resident at Lucknow, with especial reference to  the great changes which, in all probability, will take place.  Retaining your superintendency of Thuggee affairs, it will be  manifestly necessary that you should be relieved from the duty of the  trials of Thugs usually condemned at Lucknow.   In the hope that you will not withhold from the Government your  services in the capacity I have named, and in the further hope of  finding an opportunity of personally making your acquaintance,   I have the honour to be,     Dear Colonel Sleeman,       Very faithfully yours,         DALHOUSIE.[4]    The remainder of Sleeman's official life, from January, 1849, was  spent in Oudh, and was chiefly devoted to ceaseless and hopeless  endeavours to reform the King's administration and relieve the  sufferings of his grievously oppressed subjects. On the 1st of  December, 1849, the Resident began his memorable three months' tour  through Oudh, so vividly described in the special work devoted to the  purpose. The awful revelations of the _Journey through the Kingdom of  Oude_ largely influenced the Court of Directors and the Imperial  Government in forming their decision to annex the kingdom, although  that decision was directly opposed to the advice of Sleeman, who  consistently advocated reform of the administration, while  deprecating annexation.

In such an age we can but expect bold adventures. The discovery and  exploration of the New World and the defeat of the Spanish Armada had  now made England monarch of sea and land. The imagination of the people  was aroused, and tales of a wealth like that of Croesus came from  mariners who had sailed the seven seas, and were willingly believed by  an excited audience. Indeed the nations stood ready with open-mouthed  wonder to accept all stories, no matter how marvelous or preposterous.  America suddenly appeared to all people as the land that offered wealth,  religious and political freedom, a home for the poor, a refuge for the  persecuted, in truth, a paradise for all who would begin life anew.  With such a vision and with such a spirit many came. The same energy  that created a Lear and a Hamlet created a Jamestown and a Plymouth.  Shakespeare was at the height of his career when Jamestown was settled,  and had been dead less than five years when the Puritans landed at  Plymouth. Impelled by the soul of such a day Puritan and Cavalier sought  the new land, hoping to find there that which they had been unable to  attain in the Old World.    While from the standpoint of years the Cavalier colony at Jamestown  might be entitled to the first discussion, it is with the Puritans that  we shall begin this investigation. For, with the Puritan Fathers came  the Puritan Mothers, and while the influence of those fathers on  American civilization has been too vast ever to be adequately described,  the influence of those brave pioneer women, while less ostentatious, is  none the less powerful.    What perils, what distress, what positive torture, not only physical but  mental, those first mothers of America experienced! Sickness and famine  were their daily portion in life. Their children, pushing ever westward,  also underwent untold toil and distress, but not to the degree known by  those founders of New England; for when the settlements of the later  seventeenth century were established some part of the rawness and  newness had worn away, friends were not far distant, supplies were not  wanting for long periods, and if the privations were intense, there were  always the original settlements to fall back upon. Hear what Thomas  Prince in his _Annals of New England_, published in 1726, has to say of  those first days in the Plymouth Colony:    \"March 24. (1621) N.B. This month Thirteen of our number die. And in  three months past die Half our Company. The greatest part in the depth  of winter, wanting houses and other comforts; being infected with the  scurvy and other diseases, which their long voyage and unaccommodate  conditions bring upon them. So as there die, sometimes, two or three a  day. Of one hundred persons, scarce fifty remain. The living scarce able  to bury the dead; the well not sufficient to tend the sick: there being,  in their time of greatest distress, but six or seven; who spare no pains  to help them.... But the spring advancing, it pleases GOD, the mortality  begins to cease; and the sick and lame to recover: which puts new life  into the people; though they had borne their sad affliction with as much  patience as any could do.\"[1]    Indeed, as we read of that struggle with famine, sickness, and death  during the first few years of the Plymouth Colony we can but marvel that  human flesh and human soul could withstand the onslaught. The brave old  colonist Bradford, confirms in his _History of Plymouth Plantation_ the  stories told by others: \"But that which was most sad and lamentable, was  that in two or three months' time half of their company died, especially  in January and February, being the depth of winter ... that of one  hundred and odd persons scarce fifty remained: and of these in the time  of most distress there was but six or seven sound persons; who to their  great commendations, be it spoken, spared no pains, night nor day, but  with abundance of toil and hazard of their own health, fetched them  wood, made them fires, ... in a word did all the homely, and necessary  offices for them.\"    The conditions were the same whether in the Plymouth or in the  Massachusetts Bay Colony. And yet how brave--how pathetically brave--was  the colonial woman under every affliction. In hours when a less valiant  womanhood would have sunk in despair these wives and mothers  strengthened one another and praised God for the humble sustenance He  allowed them. The sturdy colonist, Edward Johnson, in his _Wonder  Working Providence of Zions Saviour in New England_, writing of the  privations of 1631, the year after his colony had been founded, pays  this tribute to the help-meets of the men:    \"The women once a day, as the tide gave way, resorted to the mussels,  and clambanks, which are a fish as big as horse-mussels, where they  daily gathered their families' food with much heavenly discourse of the  provisions Christ had formerly made for many thousands of his followers  in the wilderness. Quoth one, 'My husband hath travelled as far as  Plymouth (which is near forty miles), and hath with great toil brought a  little corn home with him, and before that is spent the Lord will  assuredly provide.' Quoth the other, 'Our last peck of meal is now in  the oven at home a-baking, and many of our godly neighbors have quite  spent all, and we owe one loaf of that little we have.' Then spake a  third, 'My husband hath ventured himself among the Indians for corn, and  can get none, as also our honored Governor hath distributed his so far,  that a day or two more will put an end to his store, and all the rest,  and yet methinks our children are as cheerful, fat and lusty with  feeding upon these mussels, clambanks, and other fish, as they were in  England with their fill of bread, which makes me cheerful in the Lord's  providing for us, being further confirmed by the exhortation of our  pastor to trust the Lord with providing for us; whose is the earth and  the fulness thereof.'\"    It is a genuine pleasure to us of little faith to note that such trust  was indeed justified; for, continued Johnson: \"As they were encouraging  one another in Christ's careful providing for them, they lift up their  eyes and saw two ships coming in, and presently this news came to their  ears, that they were come--full of victuals.... After this manner did  Christ many times graciously provide for this His people, even at the  last cast.\"    If we will stop to consider the fact that many of these women of the  Massachusetts Bay Colony were accustomed to the comfortable living of  the middle-class country people of England, with considerable material  wealth and even some of the luxuries of modern civilization, we may  imagine, at least in part, the terrifying contrast met with in the New  World. For conditions along the stormy coast of New England were indeed  primitive. Picture the founding, for instance, of a town that later was  destined to become the home of philosopher and seer--Concord,  Massachusetts. Says Johnson in his _Wonder Working Providence_:    \"After they had thus found out a place of abode they burrow themselves  in the earth for their first shelter, under some hillside, casting the  earth aloft upon timber; they make a smoke fire against the earth at the  highest side and thus these poor servants of Christ provide shelter for  themselves, their wives and little ones, keeping off the short showers  from their lodgings, but the long rains penetrate through to their great  disturbance in the night season. Yet in these poor wigwams they sing  psalms, pray and praise their God till they can provide them houses,  which ordinarily was not wont to be with many till the earth by the  Lord's blessing brought forth bread to feed them, their wives and little  ones.... Thus this poor people populate this howling desert, marching  manfully on, the Lord assisting, through the greatest difficulties and  sorest labors that ever any with such weak means have done.\"    And Margaret Winthrop writes thus to her step-son in England: \"When I  think of the troublesome times and manyfolde destractions that are in  our native Countrye, I thinke we doe not pryse oure happinesse heare as  we have cause, that we should be in peace when so many troubles are in  most places of the world.\"    Many another quotation could be presented to emphasize the impressions  given above. Reading these after the lapse of nearly three centuries, we  marvel at the strength, the patience, the perseverance, the imperishable  hope, trust, and faith of the Puritan woman. Such hardships and  privations as have been described above might seem sufficient; but these  were by no means all or even the greatest of the trials of womanhood in  the days of the nation's childhood. To understand in any measure at all  the life of a child or a wife or a mother of the Puritan colonies with  its strain and suffering, we must know and comprehend her religion. Let  us examine this--the dominating influence of her life.      _II. Woman and Her Religion_    Paradoxical as it may seem, religion was to the colonial woman both a  blessing and a curse. Though it gave courage and some comfort it was as  hard and unyielding as steel. We of this later hour may well shudder  when we read the sermons of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards; but if  the mere reading causes astonishment after the lapse of these hundreds  of years, what terror the messages must have inspired in those who lived  under their terrific indictments, prophecies, and warnings. Here was a  religion based on Judaism and the Mosaic code, \"an eye "]]]
