An Egg Samuel Butler, for  the notebook of housewives, may be summarized as a pyramid, based upon  toast, whereof the chief masonries are a flake of bacon, an egg poached  to firmness, a wreath of mushrooms, a cap-sheaf of red peppers; the  whole dribbled with a warm pink sauce of which the inventor retains the  secret.  To this the bookseller chef added fried potatoes from another  dish, and poured for his guest a glass of wine.    \"This is California catawba,\" said Mifflin, \"in which the grape and the  sunshine very pleasantly (and cheaply) fulfil their allotted destiny.  I pledge you prosperity to the black art of Advertising!\"    The psychology of the art and mystery of Advertising rests upon tact,  an instinctive perception of the tone and accent which will be en  rapport with the mood of the hearer.  Mr. Gilbert was aware of this,  and felt that quite possibly his host was prouder of his whimsical  avocation as gourmet than of his sacred profession as a bookman.    \"Is it possible, sir,\" he began, in lucid Johnsonian, \"that you can  concoct so delicious an entree in so few minutes?  You are not hoaxing  me?  There is no secret passage between Gissing Street and the  laboratories of the Ritz?\"    \"Ah, you should taste Mrs. Mifflin's cooking!\" said the bookseller.  \"I  am only an amateur, who dabbles in the craft during her absence.  She  is on a visit to her cousin in Boston.  She becomes, quite justifiably,  weary of the tobacco of this establishment, and once or twice a year it  does her good to breathe the pure serene of Beacon Hill.  During her  absence it is my privilege to inquire into the ritual of housekeeping.  I find it very sedative after the incessant excitement and speculation  of the shop.\"    \"I should have thought,\" said Gilbert, \"that life in a bookshop would  be delightfully tranquil.\"    \"Far from it.  Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse of  explosives.  Those shelves are ranked with the most furious  combustibles in the world--the brains of men.  I can spend a rainy  afternoon reading, and my mind works itself up to such a passion and  anxiety over mortal problems as almost unmans me.  It is terribly  nerve-racking.  Surround a man with Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau,  Chesterton, Shaw, Nietzsche, and George Ade--would you wonder at his  getting excited?  What would happen to a cat if she had to live in a  room tapestried with catnip?  She would go crazy!\"    \"Truly, I had never thought of that phase of bookselling,\" said the  young man.  \"How is it, though, that libraries are shrines of such  austere calm?  If books are as provocative as you suggest, one would  expect every librarian to utter the shrill screams of a hierophant, to  clash ecstatic castanets in his silent alcoves!\"    \"Ah, my boy, you forget the card index!  Librarians invented that  soothing device for the febrifuge of their souls, just as I fall back  upon the rites of the kitchen.  Librarians would all go mad, those  capable of concentrated thought, if they did not have the cool and  healing card index as medicament!  Some more of the eggs?\"    \"Thank you,\" said Gilbert.  \"Who was the butler whose name was  associated with the dish?\"    \"What?\" cried Mifflin, in agitation, \"you have not heard of Samuel  Butler, the author of The Way of All Flesh?  My dear young man, whoever  permits himself to die before he has read that book, and also Erewhon,  has deliberately forfeited his chances of paradise.  For paradise in  the world to come is uncertain, but there is indeed a heaven on this  earth, a heaven which we inhabit when we read a good book.  Pour  yourself another glass of wine, and permit me----\"    (Here followed an enthusiastic development of the perverse philosophy  of Samuel Butler, which, in deference to my readers, I omit.  Mr.  Gilbert took notes of the conversation in his pocketbook, and I am  pleased to say that his heart was moved to a realization of his  iniquity, for he was observed at the Public Library a few days later  asking for a copy of The Way of All Flesh.  After inquiring at four  libraries, and finding all copies of the book in circulation, he was  compelled to buy one.  He never regretted doing so.)    \"But I am forgetting my duties as host,\" said Mifflin.  \"Our dessert  consists of apple sauce, gingerbread, and coffee.\" He rapidly cleared  the empty dishes from the table and brought on the second course.    \"I have been noticing the warning over the sideboard,\" said Gilbert.  \"I hope you will let me help you this evening?\"  He pointed to a card  hanging near the kitchen door.  It read:           ALWAYS WASH DISHES       IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEALS       IT SAVES TROUBLE      \"I'm afraid I don't always obey that precept,\" said the bookseller as  he poured the coffee.  \"Mrs. Mifflin hangs it there whenever she goes  away, to remind me.  But, as our friend Samuel Butler says, he that is  stupid in little will also be stupid in much.  I have a different  theory about dish-washing, and I please myself by indulging it.    \"I used to regard dish-washing merely as an ignoble chore, a kind of  hateful discipline which had to be undergone with knitted brow and  brazen fortitude.  When my wife went away the first time, I erected a  reading stand and an electric light over the sink, and used to read  while my hands went automatically through base gestures of  purification.  I made the great spirits of literature partners of my  sorrow, and learned by heart a good deal of Paradise Lost and of Walt  Mason, while I soused and wallowed among pots and pans.  I used to  comfort myself with two lines of Keats:           'The moving waters at their priest-like task       Of pure ablution round earth's human shores----'      Then a new conception of the matter struck me.  It is intolerable for a  human being to go on doing any task as a penance, under duress.  No  matter what the work is, one must spiritualize it in some way, shatter  the old idea of it into bits and rebuild it nearer to the heart's  desire.  How was I to do this with dish-washing?    \"I broke a good many plates while I was pondering over the matter.  Then it occurred to me that here was just the relaxation I needed.  I  had been worrying over the mental strain of being surrounded all day  long by vociferous books, crying out at me their conflicting views as  to the glories and agonies of life.  Why not make dish-washing my balm  and poultice?    \"When one views a stubborn fact from a new angle, it is amazing how all  its contours and edges change shape!  Immediately my dishpan began to  glow with a kind of philosophic halo!  The warm, soapy water became a  sovereign medicine to retract hot blood from the head; the homely act  of washing and drying cups and saucers became a symbol of the order and  cleanliness that man imposes on the unruly world about him.  I tore  down my book rack and reading lamp from over the sink.    \"Mr. Gilbert,\" he went on, \"do not laugh at me when I tell you that I  have evolved a whole kitchen philosophy of my own.  I find the kitchen  the shrine of our civilization, the focus of all that is comely in  life.  The ruddy shine of the stove is as beautiful as any sunset.  A  well-polished jug or spoon is as fair, as complete and beautiful, as  any sonnet.  The dish mop, properly rinsed and wrung and hung outside  the back door to dry, is a whole sermon in itself.  The stars never  look so bright as they do from the kitchen door after the ice-box pan  is emptied and the whole place is 'redd up,' as the Scotch say.\"    \"A very delightful philosophy indeed,\" said Gilbert.  \"And now that we  have finished our meal, I insist upon your letting me give you a hand  with the washing up.  I am eager to test this dish-pantheism of yours!\"    \"My dear fellow,\" said Mifflin, laying a restraining hand on his  impetuous guest, \"it is a poor philosophy that will not abide denial  now and then.  No, no--I did not ask you to spend the evening with me  to wash dishes.\"  And he led the way back to his sitting room.    \"When I saw you come in,\" said Mifflin, \"I was afraid you might be a  newspaper man, looking for an interview.  A young journalist came to  see us once, with very unhappy results.  He wheedled himself into Mrs.  Mifflin's good graces, and ended by putting us both into a book, called  Parnassus on Wheels, which has been rather a trial to me.  In that book  he attributes to me a number of shallow and sugary observations upon  bookselling that have been an annoyance to the trade.  I am happy to  say, though, that his book had only a trifling sale.\"    \"I have never heard of it,\" said Gilbert.    \"If you are really interested in bookselling you should come here some  evening to a meeting of the Corn Cob Club.  Once a month a number of  booksellers gather here and we discuss matters of bookish concern over  corn-cobs and cider.  We have all sorts and conditions of booksellers:  one is a fanatic on the subject of libraries.  He thinks that every  public library should be dynamited.  Another thinks that moving  pictures will destroy the book trade.  What rot!  Surely everything  that arouses people's minds, that makes them alert and questioning,  increases their appetite for books.\"    \"The life of a bookseller is very demoralizing to the intellect,\" he  went on after a pause.  \"He is surrounded by innumerable books; he  cannot possibly read them all; he dips into one and picks up a scrap  from another.  His mind gradually fills itself with miscellaneous  flotsam, with superficial opinions, with a thousand half-knowledges.  Almost unconsciously he begins to rate literature according to what  people ask for.  He begins to wonder whether Ralph Waldo Trine isn't  really greater than Ralph Waldo Emerson, whether J. M. Chapple isn't as  big a man as J. M. Barrie.

The pricking of witches was at one time a  lucrative profession both in England and Scotland, one of the most  noted prickers being a wretched imposter named Matthew Hopkins who was  sent for to all parts of the country to exercise his vile art. Ralph  Gardner, in his _England's Grievance Discovered_ (1655), speaks also  of two prickers, Thomas Shovel and Cuthbert Nicholson, who, in 1649  and 1650, were sent by the magistrates of Newcastle-on-Tyne, into  Scotland, there to confer with another very able man in that line and  bring him back to Newcastle. They were to have twenty shillings, but  the Scotchman three pounds, per head _of all they could convict_, and  a free passage there and back. When these wretches got to any  town--for they tried all the chief market-towns in the district--the  crier used to go round with his bell, desiring \"all people that would  bring in any complaint against any woman for a witch, they should be  sent for and tried by the person appointed.\" As many as thirty women  were brought at once into the Newcastle town-hall, stripped and  pricked, and twenty-seven set aside as guilty. Gardner continues:--         The said witch-finder acquainted Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson       that he knew women whether they were witches or no by their       looks; and when the said person was searching of a       personable and good-like woman, the said colonel replied and       said, 'Surely this woman is none, and need not be tried;'       but the Scotchman said she was, for the town said she was,       and therefore he would try her; and presently, in sight of       all the people, laid her body naked to the waist, with her       clothes over her head, by which fright and shame all her       blood contracted into one part of her body, and then he ran       a pin into her thigh, and then suddenly let her coats fall,       and then demanded whether she had nothing of his in her       body, but did not bleed? But she, being amazed, replied       little. Then he put his hands up her coats and pulled out       the pin, and set her aside as a guilty person and child of       the devil, and fell to try others, whom he made guilty.       Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson, perceiving the alteration of the       aforesaid woman by her blood settling in her right parts,       caused that woman to be brought again, and her clothes       pulled up to her thigh, and required the Scot to run the pin       into the same place, and then it gushed out of blood, and       the said Scot cleared her, and said she was not a child of       the devil.    If this precious wretch had not been stopped he would have declared  half the women in the north country to be witches. But the magistrates  and the people got tired of him at last, and his imposture being  discovered, he was hanged in Scotland. At the gallows he confessed  that he had been the death of 220 men and women in England and  Scotland, simply for the sake of the twenty shillings which he  generally received as blood-money.           *       *       *       *       *    The belief in _Sorcerots_, or witches' spells of a peculiar kind,  mentioned in the _Depositions_ (pages 22, 23, &c.) receives curious  modern confirmation by a kindred superstition still current among the  emancipated negroes of the United States. It was described in a letter  on \"Voudouism in Virginia\" which appeared in the _New York Tribune_,  dated Richmond, September 17, 1875. Mr. Moncure D. Conway, in quoting  this and commenting on it in his _Demonology and Devil-Lore_ (Vol. I.  pages 68-69), says that it belongs to a class of superstitions  generally kept close from the whites, as he believes, because of their  purely African origin. Mr. Conway is, however, probably mistaken about  the origin, seeing that the same belief prevailed in Guernsey three  centuries ago. The extract from the letter is as follows:--         If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he       cannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of       witchcraft, and having no faith in \"white folks' physic\" for       such ailments, must apply to one of these quacks. A       physician residing near the city [Richmond] was invited by       such a one to witness his mode of procedure with a dropsical       patient for whom the physician in question had occasionally       charitably prescribed. Curiosity led him to attend the       seance, having previously informed the quack that since the       case was in such hands he relinquished all connection with       it. On the coverlet of the bed on which the sick man lay,       was spread a quantity of bones, feathers, and other trash.       The charlatan went through with a series of so-called       conjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of       wood in a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the       physician's comprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the       pillows and bolsters, and took from them some queer       conglomerations of feathers. These he said had caused all       the trouble. Sprinkling a whitish powder over them, he burnt       them in his furnace. A black offensive smoke was produced,       and he announced triumphantly that the evil influence was       destroyed, and that the patient would surely get well. He       died not many days later, believing, in common with his       friends and relatives, that the conjurations of the \"trick       doctor\" had failed to save him only because resorted to too       late.    From the above it is evident that the natural tendency of wool and  feathers to felt and clog together, has been distorted, by widely  different peoples, into an outward and visible sign that occult and  malignant influences were at work.           *       *       *       *       *    As to the manner in which wizards and witches were put to the question  in Guernsey--that is tortured until they confessed whatever was  required of them--Mr. Warburton, a herald and celebrated antiquary who  wrote in the reign of Charles II., has given a circumstancial account,  the correctness of which may be relied on. His _Treatise on the  History, Laws and Customs of the Island of Guernsey_, bears the date  of 1682, and at page 126 he says:--         By the law approved (_Terrien_, Lib. xii. cap. 37), torture       is to be used, though not upon slight presumption, yet where       the presumptive proof is strong, and much more when the       proof is positive, and there wants only the confession of       the party accused. Yet this practice of torturing does not       appear to have been used in the island for some ages, except       in the case of witches, when it was too frequently applied,       near a century since. The custom then was, when any person       was supposed guilty of sorcery or witchcraft, they carried       them to a place in the town called _La Tour Beauregard_, and       there, tying their hands behind them by the two thumbs, drew       them to a certain height with an engine made for that       purpose, by which means sometimes their shoulders were       turned round; and sometimes their thumbs torn off; but this       fancy of witches has for some years been laid aside.    It will be noticed in the subsequent _Confessions_ of witches (page  11, &c.), that a number of colons (:) are inserted in the text where  they would not be required as ordinary marks of punctuation. These  correspond, however, to similar pauses in the original records, and  evidently indicate the successive stages by which the story was wrung  from the wretched victims. They are thus endowed with a sad and  ghastly significance, which must be borne in mind when the confessions  are read. It must also be remembered that these confessions were not  usually made in the connected form in which they stand recorded, but  were rather the result of leading questions put by the inquisitors,  such as: How old were you when the Devil first appeared to you? What  form did he assume? What parish were you in? What were you doing? &c.,  &c.    Melancholy and revolting as all this is, yet the tortures made use of  in Guernsey were far from possessing those refinements of cruelty and  that intensity of brutality which characterised the methods practiced  in some other countries. Let us take as a proof of this, the notable  case of Dr. Fian and his associates, who were tried at Edinburgh, in  the year 1591. The evidence was of the usual ridiculous kind, and a  confession--afterwards withdrawn--was extorted by the following  blood-curdling barbarities, as is quoted by Mr. C.K. Sharpe, in his  _Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland_:--         The said Doctor was taken and imprisoned, and used with the       accustomed paine provided for those offences inflicted upon       the rest, as is aforesaid. First, by thrawing of his head       with a rope, whereat he would confesse nothing. Secondly, he       was perswaded by faire meanes to confesse his follies; but       that would prevaile as little. Lastly, hee was put to the       most severe and cruell paine in the world, called the       bootes, who, after he had received three strokes, being       inquired if he would confesse his damnable actes and wicked       life, his toong would not serve him to speak; in respect       whereof, the rest of the witches willed to search his toong,       under which was founde two pinnes thrust up into the heade,       whereupon the witches did say, now is the charme stinted,       and shewed that these charmed pins were the cause he could       not confesse any thing; then was he immediately released of       the bootes, brought before the King, his confession was"]]]
