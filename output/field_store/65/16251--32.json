Its existence is of interest to us now  because it shows the objective validity of the basis on which erotic  symbolism, as we have here to understand it, develops. But from first to  last it is a distinct phenomenon, having a more or less reasoned and  intellectual basis, and it scarcely serves in any degree to feed the  sexual impulse. Erotic symbolism is not intellectual but emotional in its  origin; it starts into being, obscurely, with but a dim consciousness or  for the most part none at all, either suddenly from the shock of some  usually youthful experience, or more gradually through an instinctive  brooding on those things which are most intimately associated with a  sexually desirable person.        The kind of soil on which the germs of erotic symbolism may      develop is well seen in cases of sexual hyperaesthesia. In such      cases all the emotionally sexual analogies and resemblances,      which in erotic symbolism are fixed and organized, may be traced      in vague and passing forms, a single hyperaesthetic individual      perhaps presenting a great variety of germinal symbolisms.        Thus it has been recorded of an Italian nun (whose sister became      a prostitute) that from the age of 8 she had desire for coitus,      from the age of 10 masturbated, and later had homosexual      feelings, that the same feelings and practices continued after      she had taken the veil, though from time to time they assumed      religious equivalents. The mere contact, indeed, of a priest's      hand, the news of the presentation of an ecclesiastic she had      known to a bishopric, the sight of an ape, the contemplation of      the crucified Christ, the figure of a toy, the picture of a      demon, the act of defecation in the children entrusted to her      care (whom, on this account, and against the regulations, she      would accompany to the closets), especially the sight and the      mere recollection of flies in sexual connection--all these things      sufficed to produce in her a powerful orgasm. (_Archivio di      Psichiatria_, 1902, fasc. II-III, p. 338.)        A boy of 15 (given to masturbation), studied by Macdonald in      America, was similarly hyperaesthetic to the symbols of sexual      emotion. \"I like amusing myself with my comrades,\" he told      Macdonald, \"rolling ourselves into a ball, which gives one a      funny kind of warmth. I have a special pleasure in talking about      some things. It is the same when the governess kisses me on      saying good night or when I lean against her breast. I have that      sensation, too, when I see some of the pictures in the comic      papers, but only in those representing a woman, as when a young      man skating trips up a girl so that her clothes are raised a      little. When I read how a man saved a young girl from drowning,      so that they swam together, I had the same sensation. Looking at      the statues of women in the museum produces the same effect, or      when I see naked babies, or when a mother suckles a child. I      have often had that sensation when reading novels I ought not to      read, or when looking at a new-born calf, or seeing dogs and cows      and horses mounting on each other. When I see a girl flirting      with a boy, or leaning on his shoulder or with his arm round her      waist, I have an erection. It is the same when I see women and      little girls in bathing costume, or when boys talk of what their      fathers and mothers do together. In the Natural History Museum I      often see things which give me that sensation. One day when I      read how a man killed a young girl and carried her into a wood      and undressed her I had a feeling of enjoyment. When I read of      men who were bastards the idea of a woman having a child in that      way gives me this sensation. Some dances, and seeing young girls      astride a horse, excited me, too, and so in a circus when a woman      was shot out of a cannon and her skirts flew in the air. It has      no effect on me when I see men naked. Sometimes I enjoy seeing      women's underclothes in a shop, or when I see a lady or a girl      buying them, especially if they are drawers. When I saw a lady in      a dress which buttoned from top to bottom it had more effect on      me than seeing underclothes. Seeing dogs coupling gives me more      pleasure than looking at pretty women, but less than looking at      pretty little girls.\" In order of increasing intensity he placed      the phenomena that affected him thus: The coupling of flies, then      of horses, then the sight of women's undergarments, then a boy      and a girl flirting, then cows mounting on each other, the      statues of women with naked breasts, then contact with the      governess's body and breasts, finally coitus. (Arthur Macdonald,      _Le Criminel-Type_, pp. 126 et seq.)        It is worthy of remark that the instinct of nutrition, when      restrained, may exhibit something of an analogous symbolism,      though in a minor degree, to that of sex. The ways in which a      hyperaesthetic hunger may seek its symbols are illustrated in the      case of a young woman called Nadia, who during several years was      carefully studied by Janet. It is a case of obsession (\"maladie      du scrupule\"), simulating hysterical anorexia, in which the      patient, for fear of getting fat, reduced her nourishment to the      smallest possible amount. \"Nadia is generally hungry, even very      hungry. One can tell this by her actions; from time to time she      forgets herself to such an extent as to devour greedily anything      she can put her hands on. At other times, when she cannot resist      the desire to eat, she secretly takes a biscuit. She feels      horrible remorse for the action, but, all the same, she does it      again. Her confidences are very curious. She recognizes that a      great effort is needed to avoid eating, and considers she is a      heroine to resist so long. 'Sometimes I spent whole hours in      thinking about food, I was so hungry; I swallowed my saliva, I      bit my handkerchief, I rolled on the floor, I wanted to eat so      badly. I would look in books for descriptions of meals and      feasts, and tried to deceive my hunger by imagining that I was      sharing all these good things,'\" (P. Janet, \"La Maladie du      Scrupule,\" _Revue Philosophique_, May, 1901, p. 502.) The      deviations of the instinct of nutrition are, however, confined      within narrow limits, and, in the nature of things, hunger,      unlike sexual desire, cannot easily accept a fetich.    \"There is almost no feature, article of dress, attitude, act,\" Stanley  Hall declares, \"or even animal or perhaps object in nature, that may not  have to some morbid soul specialized erogenic and erethic power.\"[6] Even  a mere shadow may become a fetich. Goron tells of a merchant in Paris--a  man with a reputation for ability, happily married and the father of a  family, altogether irreproachable in his private life--who was returning  home one evening after a game of billiards with a friend, when, on  chancing to raise his eyes, he saw against a lighted window the shadow of  a woman changing her chemise. He fell in love with that shadow and  returned to the spot every evening for many months to gaze at the window.  Yet--and herein lies the fetichism--he made no attempt to see the woman or  to find out who she was; the shadow sufficed; he had no need of the  realty.[7] It is even possible to have a negative fetich, the absence of  some character being alone demanded, and the case has been recorded in  Chicago of an American gentleman of average intelligence, education, and  good habits who, having as a boy cherished a pure affection for a girl  whose leg had been amputated, throughout life was relatively impotent with  normal women, but experienced passion and affection for women who had lost  a leg; he was found by his wife to be in extensive correspondence with  one-legged women all over the country, expending no little money on the  purchase of artificial legs for his various protegees.[8]    It is important to remember, however, that while erotic symbolism becomes  fantastic and abnormal in its extreme manifestations, it is in its  essence absolutely normal. It is only in the very grossest forms of sexual  desire that it is altogether absent. Stendhal described the mental side of  the process of tumescence as a crystallization, a process whereby certain  features of the beloved person present points around which the emotions  held in solution in the lover's mind may concentrate and deposit  themselves in dazzling brilliance. This process inevitably tends to take  place around all those features and objects associated with the beloved  person which have most deeply impressed the lover's mind, and the more  sensitive and imaginative and emotional he is the more certainly will such  features and objects crystallize into erotic symbols. \"Devotion and love,\"  wrote Mary Wollstonecraft, \"may be allowed to hallow the garments as well  as the person, for the lover must want fancy who has not a sort of sacred  respect for the glove or slipper of his mistress. He would not confound  them with vulgar things of the same kind.\" And nearly two centuries  earlier Burton, who had gathered together so much of the ancient lore of  love, clearly asserted the entirely normal character of erotic symbolism.  \"Not one of a thousand falls in love,\" he declares, \"but there is some  peculiar part or other which pleaseth most, and inflames him above the  rest.... If he gets any remnant of hers, a busk-point, a feather of her  fan, a shoe-tie, a lace, a ring, a bracelet of hair, he wears it for a  favor on his arm, in his hat, finger, or next his heart; as Laodamia did  by Protesilaus, when he went to war, sit at home with his picture before  her: a garter or a bracelet of hers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#3)"],[1,"on a Reasonable  and Humane Basis--Summary and Conclusion.

A man's sexual nature, like all else that is most essential in him, is  rooted in a soil that was formed very long before his birth. In this, as  in every other respect, he draws the elements of his life from his  ancestors, however new the recombination may be and however greatly it may  be modified by subsequent conditions. A man's destiny stands not in the  future but in the past. That, rightly considered, is the most vital of all  vital facts. Every child thus has a right to choose his own ancestors.  Naturally he can only do this vicariously, through his parents. It is the  most serious and sacred duty of the future father to choose one half of  the ancestral and hereditary character of his future child; it is the most  serious and sacred duty of the future mother to make a similar choice.[1]  In choosing each other they have between them chosen the whole ancestry of  their child. They have determined the stars that will rule his fate.    In the past that fateful determination has usually been made helplessly,  ignorantly, almost unconsciously. It has either been guided by an  instinct which, on the whole, has worked out fairly well, or controlled by  economic interests of the results of which so much cannot be said, or left  to the risks of lower than bestial chances which can produce nothing but  evil. In the future we cannot but have faith--for all the hope of humanity  must rest on that faith--that a new guiding impulse, reinforcing natural  instinct and becoming in time an inseparable accompaniment of it, will  lead civilized man on his racial course. Just as in the past the race has,  on the whole, been moulded by a natural, and in part sexual, selection,  that was unconscious of itself and ignorant of the ends it made towards,  so in the future the race will be moulded by deliberate selection, the  creative energy of Nature becoming self-conscious in the civilized brain  of man. This is not a faith which has its source in a vague hope. The  problems of the individual life are linked on to the fate of the racial  life, and again and again we shall find as we ponder the individual  questions we are here concerned with, that at all points they ultimately  converge towards this same racial end.    Since we have here, therefore, to follow out the sexual relationships of  the individual as they bear on society, it will be convenient at this  point to put aside the questions of ancestry and to accept the individual  as, with hereditary constitution already determined, he lies in his  mother's womb.    It is the mother who is the child's supreme parent. At various points in  zooelogical evolution it has seemed possible that the functions that we now  know as those of maternity would be largely and even equally shared by the  male parent. Nature has tried various experiments in this direction, among  the fishes, for instance, and even among birds. But reasonable and  excellent as these experiments were, and though they were sufficiently  sound to secure their perpetuation unto this day, it remains true that it  was not along these lines that Man was destined to emerge. Among all the  mammal predecessors of Man, the male is an imposing and important figure  in the early days of courtship, but after conception has once been secured  the mother plays the chief part in the racial life. The male must be  content to forage abroad and stand on guard when at home in the  ante-chamber of the family. When she has once been impregnated the female  animal angrily rejects the caresses she had welcomed so coquettishly  before, and even in Man the place of the father at the birth of his child  is not a notably dignified or comfortable one. Nature accords the male but  a secondary and comparatively humble place in the home, the breeding-place  of the race; he may compensate himself if he will, by seeking adventure  and renown in the world outside. The mother is the child's supreme parent,  and during the period from conception to birth the hygiene of the future  man can only be affected by influences which work through her.    Fundamental and elementary as is the fact of the predominant position of  the mother in relation to the life of the race, incontestable as it must  seem to all those who have traversed the volumes of these _Studies_ up to  the present point, it must be admitted that it has sometimes been  forgotten or ignored. In the great ages of humanity it has indeed been  accepted as a central and sacred fact. In classic Rome at one period the  house of the pregnant woman was adorned with garlands, and in Athens it  was an inviolable sanctuary where even the criminal might find shelter.  Even amid the mixed influences of the exuberantly vital times which  preceded the outburst of the Renaissance, the ideally beautiful woman, as  pictures still show, was the pregnant woman. But it has not always been  so. At the present time, for instance, there can be no doubt that we are  but beginning to emerge from a period during which this fact was often  disputed and denied, both in theory and in practice, even by women  themselves. This was notably the case both in England and America, and it  is probably owing in large part to the unfortunate infatuation which led  women in these lands to follow after masculine ideals that at the present  moment the inspirations of progress in women's"]]]
