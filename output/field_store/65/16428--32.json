[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16726"],[0,"Four Weird Tales (#3)"],[1,", the strain had nevertheless  told severely upon him, and he reached home wondering for the first time  in his life whether there was perhaps a point beyond which he would be  unable to restrain himself any longer.    For something out of the usual had happened. At the close of a passage  of great stress between the two, every nerve in the secretary's body  tingling from undeserved abuse, the Manager had suddenly turned full  upon him, in the corner of the private room where the safes stood, in  such a way that the glare of his red eyes, magnified by the glasses,  looked straight into his own. And at this very second that other  personality in Jones--the one that was ever _watching_--rose up swiftly  from the deeps within and held a mirror to his face.    A moment of flame and vision rushed over him, and for one single  second--one merciless second of clear sight--he saw the Manager as the  tall dark man of his evil dreams, and the knowledge that he had suffered  at his hands some awful injury in the past crashed through his mind like  the report of a cannon.    It all flashed upon him and was gone, changing him from fire to ice,  and then back again to fire; and he left the office with the certain  conviction in his heart that the time for his final settlement with the  man, the time for the inevitable retribution, was at last drawing very  near.    According to his invariable custom, however, he succeeded in putting  the memory of all this unpleasantness out of his mind with the changing  of his office coat, and after dozing a little in his leather chair  before the fire, he started out as usual for dinner in the Soho French  restaurant, and began to dream himself away into the region of flowers  and singing, and to commune with the Invisibles that were the very  sources of his real life and being.    For it was in this way that his mind worked, and the habits of years had  crystallised into rigid lines along which it was now necessary and  inevitable for him to act.    At the door of the little restaurant he stopped short, a half-remembered  appointment in his mind. He had made an engagement with some one, but  where, or with whom, had entirely slipped his memory. He thought it was  for dinner, or else to meet just after dinner, and for a second it came  back to him that it had something to do with the office, but, whatever  it was, he was quite unable to recall it, and a reference to his pocket  engagement book showed only a blank page. Evidently he had even omitted  to enter it; and after standing a moment vainly trying to recall either  the time, place, or person, he went in and sat down.    But though the details had escaped him, his subconscious memory seemed  to know all about it, for he experienced a sudden sinking of the heart,  accompanied by a sense of foreboding anticipation, and felt that  beneath his exhaustion there lay a centre of tremendous excitement. The  emotion caused by the engagement was at work, and would presently cause  the actual details of the appointment to reappear.    Inside the restaurant the feeling increased, instead of passing: some  one was waiting for him somewhere--some one whom he had definitely  arranged to meet. He was expected by a person that very night and just  about that very time. But by whom? Where? A curious inner trembling came  over him, and he made a strong effort to hold himself in hand and to be  ready for anything that might come.    And then suddenly came the knowledge that the place of appointment was  this very restaurant, and, further, that the person he had promised to  meet was already here, waiting somewhere quite close beside him.    He looked up nervously and began to examine the faces round him. The  majority of the diners were Frenchmen, chattering loudly with much  gesticulation and laughter; and there was a fair sprinkling of clerks  like himself who came because the prices were low and the food good, but  there was no single face that he recognised until his glance fell upon  the occupant of the corner seat opposite, generally filled by himself.    \"There's the man who's waiting for me!\" thought Jones instantly.    He knew it at once. The man, he saw, was sitting well back into the  corner, with a thick overcoat buttoned tightly up to the chin. His skin  was very white, and a heavy black beard grew far up over his cheeks. At  first the secretary took him for a stranger, but when he looked up and  their eyes met, a sense of familiarity flashed across him, and for a  second or two Jones imagined he was staring at a man he had known years  before. For, barring the beard, it was the face of an elderly clerk who  had occupied the next desk to his own when he first entered the service  of the insurance company, and had shown him the most painstaking  kindness and sympathy in the early difficulties of his work. But a  moment later the illusion passed, for he remembered that Thorpe had been  dead at least five years. The similarity of the eyes was obviously a  mere suggestive trick of memory.    The two men stared at one another for several seconds, and then Jones  began to act _instinctively_, and because he had to. He crossed over and  took the vacant seat at the other's table, facing him; for he felt it  was somehow imperative to explain why he was late, and how it was he had  almost forgotten the engagement altogether.    No honest excuse, however, came to his assistance, though his mind had  begun to work furiously.    \"Yes, you _are_ late,\" said the man quietly, before he could find a  single word to utter. \"But it doesn't matter. Also, you had forgotten  the appointment, but that makes no difference either.\"    \"I knew--that there was an engagement,\" Jones stammered, passing his  hand over his forehead; \"but somehow--\"    \"You will recall it presently,\" continued the other in a gentle voice,  and smiling a little. \"It was in deep sleep last night we arranged this,  and the unpleasant occurrences of to-day have for the moment obliterated  it.\"    A faint memory stirred within him as the man spoke, and a grove of trees  with moving forms hovered before his eyes and then vanished again, while  for an instant the stranger seemed to be capable of self-distortion and  to have assumed vast proportions, with wonderful flaming eyes.    \"Oh!\" he gasped. \"It was there--in the other region?\"    \"Of course,\" said the other, with a smile that illumined his whole face.  \"You will remember presently, all in good time, and meanwhile you have  no cause to feel afraid.\"    There was a wonderful soothing quality in the man's voice, like the  whispering of a great wind, and the clerk felt calmer at once. They sat  a little while longer, but he could not remember that they talked much  or ate anything. He only recalled afterwards that the head waiter came  up and whispered something in his ear, and that he glanced round and saw  the other people were looking at him curiously, some of them laughing,  and that his companion then got up and led the way out of the  restaurant.    They walked hurriedly through the streets, neither of them speaking; and  Jones was so intent upon getting back the whole history of the affair  from the region of deep sleep, that he barely noticed the way they took.  Yet it was clear he knew where they were bound for just as well as his  companion, for he crossed the streets often ahead of him, diving down  alleys without hesitation, and the other followed always without  correction.    The pavements were very full, and the usual night crowds of London were  surging to and fro in the glare of the shop lights, but somehow no one  impeded their rapid movements, and they seemed to pass through the  people as if they were smoke. And, as they went, the pedestrians and  traffic grew less and less, and they soon passed the Mansion House and  the deserted space in front of the Royal Exchange, and so on down  Fenchurch Street and within sight of the Tower of London, rising dim and  shadowy in the smoky air.    Jones remembered all this perfectly well, and thought it was his intense  preoccupation that made the distance seem so short. But it was when the  Tower was left behind and they turned northwards that he began to notice  how altered everything was, and saw that they were in a neighbourhood  where houses were suddenly scarce, and lanes and fields beginning,  and that their only light was the stars overhead. And, as the deeper  consciousness more and more asserted itself to the exclusion of the  surface happenings of his mere body during the day, the sense of  exhaustion vanished, and he realised that he was moving somewhere in the  region of causes behind the veil, beyond the gross deceptions of the  senses, and released from the clumsy spell of space and time.    Without great surprise, therefore, he turned and saw that his companion  had altered, had shed his overcoat and black hat, and was moving beside  him absolutely _without sound_. For a brief second he saw him, tall as a  tree, extending through space like a great shadow, misty and wavering of  outline, followed by a sound like wings in the darkness; but, when he  stopped, fear clutching at his heart, the other resumed his former  proportions, and Jones could plainly see his normal outline against the  green field behind.    Then the secretary saw him fumbling at his neck, and at the same moment  the black beard came away from the face in his hand.    \"Then you _are_ Thorpe!\" he gasped, yet somehow without overwhelming  surprise.    They stood facing one another in the lonely lane, trees meeting overhead  and hiding the stars, and a sound of mournful sighing among the  branches.    \"I am Thorpe,\" was the answer in a voice that almost seemed part of the  wind. \"And I have come out of our far past to help you, for my debt to  you is large, and in this life I had but small opportunity to repay.\"    Jones thought quickly of the man's kindness to him in the office, and a  great wave of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#3)"],[1," the conductor, illustrates electrical repulsion, by the  hairs standing on end.    If the hand is held to the knob, sparks will pass from it in rapid  succession, causing in the hand a sensation of pain. This is called an  _electric shock_, and is caused by the electric fluid occasioning a  sudden motion by the contraction of the muscles through which it  passes. The force of the shock is in proportion to the power of the  machine.      What are the Muscles?    Bundles of thin fleshy fibres, or threads, fastened to the bones of  animals, the contraction and expansion of which move the bones or  perform the organic functions of life.         _Organic_, relating to organs or natural instruments by       which some process is carried on.         _Functions_, employments or offices of any part of the body.         _Contraction_, drawing in or shortening.         _Expansion_, extending or spreading out.      What is Twilight?    The light from the first dawning of day to the rising of the sun; and  again between its setting and the last remains of day. Without  twilight, the sun's light would appear at its rising, and disappear at  its setting, instantaneously; and we should experience a sudden  transition from the brightest sunshine to the profoundest obscurity.  The duration of twilight is different in different climates; and in  the same places it varies at different periods of the year.         _Instantaneously_, done in an instant, in a moment's time.         _Obscurity_, darkness, want of light.      How is it produced?    By the sun's refraction--that is, the variation of the rays of light  from their direct course, occasioned by the difference of density in  the atmosphere.         _Variation_, change.         _Density_, closeness of parts, compactness.      What is the poetical name for the morning Twilight?    Aurora, the goddess of the morning, and harbinger of the rising sun:  whom poets and artists represent as drawn by white horses in a  rose-colored chariot, unfolding with her rosy fingers the portals of  the East, pouring reviving dew upon the earth, and re-animating plants  and flowers.         _Harbinger_, a forerunner.         _Portals_, gates, doors of entrance.         _Reanimating_, invigorating with new life.      What remarkable phenomenon is afforded to the inhabitants of the polar  regions?    The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, a luminous appearance in the  northern parts of the heavens, seen mostly during winter, or in frosty  weather, and clear evenings; it assumes a variety of forms and hues,  especially in the polar regions, where it appears in its perfection,  and proves a great solace to the inhabitants amidst the gloom of their  long winter's night, which lasts from one to six months, while the  summer's day which succeeds it lasts in like manner for the same  period of time.      Of what nature is the Aurora Borealis?    It is decidedly an electrical phenomenon which takes place in the  higher regions of the atmosphere. It is somehow connected with the  magnetic poles of the earth; and generally appears in form of a  luminous arch, from east to west, but never from north to south.         _Phenomenon_, an extraordinary appearance. The word is from       a Greek one, signifying, to show or appear.         _Magnetic_, belonging to the magnet, or loadstone.         _Luminous_, bright, shining.      In what country is it seen constantly from October to Christmas?    In Siberia, where it is remarkably bright. On the western coast of  Hudson's Bay, the sun no sooner disappears, than the Aurora Borealis  diffuses a thousand different lights and colors with such dazzling  beauty, that even the full moon cannot eclipse it.          CHAPTER II.    CORN, BARLEY, PEARL BARLEY, OATS, RYE, POTATOES, TEA, COFFEE, AND  CHOCOLATE.      What is Corn?    Corn signifies a race of plants which produce grain in an ear or head,  fit for bread, the food of man; or the grain or seed of the plant,  separated from the ear.      What is generally meant by Corn?    In this country, maize, or Indian corn, is generally meant; but, in a  more comprehensive sense, the term is applied to several other kinds  of grain, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, &c.      Where was Corn first used?    It is uncertain. The Athenians pretend that it was amongst them it was  first used; the Cretans, Sicilians, and Egyptians also lay claim to  the same. From the accounts in the Bible, we find that its culture  engaged a large share of the attention of the ancient Hebrews.         _Culture_, growth, cultivation. _Hebrews_, the children of       Israel, the Jews      Who were the Athenians?    Inhabitants of Athens, the capital city of Greece.      Who were the Cretans?    The inhabitants of Crete, an island of the Archipelago.      Who were the Sicilians?    Inhabitants of Sicily, the largest island of the Mediterranean Sea,  now a part of Italy, and separated from the mainland by the Strait of  Messina.      Where do the Egyptians dwell?    In Egypt, a country of Africa. It is extremely fertile, producing  great quantities of corn. In ancient times it was called the dry nurse  of Rome and Italy, from its furnishing with corn a considerable part  of the Roman Empire; and we are informed, both from sacred and  profane history, that it was anciently the most fertile in corn of all  countries of the world. The corn of Syria has always been very  superior, and by many classed above that of Egypt.      For what is Barley generally used?    It is very extensively used for making malt, from which are prepared  beer, ale, porter, &c.; in Scotland it is a common ingredient in  broths, for which reason its consumption is very considerable, barley  broth being a dish very frequent there.         _Ingredient_, a separate part of a body consisting of       different materials.      What is Pearl Barley?    Barley freed from the husk by a mill.      What are Oats?    A valuable grain, serving as food for horses. Oats are also eaten by  the inhabitants of many countries, after being ground into meal and  made into oat cakes. Oatmeal also forms a wholesome drink for  invalids, by steeping it in boiling water.      What are the uses of Rye?    In this and some other countries it is much used for bread, either  alone or mixed with wheat; in England principally as food for cattle,  especially for sheep and lambs, when other food is scarce in winter.  Rye yields a strong spirit when distilled.         _Distilled_, subjected to distillation--the operation of       extracting spirit from a substance by evaporation and       condensation.      Of what country is the Potato a native?    Potatoes grew wild in Peru, a country of South America; whence they  were transplanted to other parts of the American continent, and  afterwards to Europe. The honor of introducing this useful vegetable  into England is divided between Sir Francis Drake, in 1580, and Sir  Walter Raleigh, in 1586, some ascribing it to the former, and others  to the latter. It is certain they were obtained from Virginia in the  time of Raleigh; they were cultivated only in the gardens of the  nobility, and were reckoned a great delicacy. They now constitute a  principal article of food in most of the countries of Europe and  America; in Ireland, they have long furnished nearly four-fifths of  the entire food of the people.      What part of the plant is eaten?    The root, which, when roasted or boiled, affords a wholesome and  agreeable meal.      What is Tea?    The leaves of an evergreen shrub, a native of China and Japan, in  which countries alone it is extensively cultivated for use. The  tea-plant was at one time introduced into South Carolina, where its  culture appears to have been attended with but little success. It may  yet become a staple production of some portions of the United States.         _Evergreen_, retaining its leaves fresh and green through       all seasons.      How is it prepared for use?    By carefully gathering the leaves, one by one, while they are yet  small, young, and juicy. They are then spread on large flat iron pans,  and placed over small furnaces, when they are constantly shifted by  the hand till they become too hot to be borne.      What is next done?    They are then removed with a kind of shovel resembling a fan, and  poured on mats, whence they are taken in small quantities, and rolled  in the palm of the hand always in one direction, until they cool and  retain the curl.      How often is this operation repeated?    Two or three times, the furnace each time being made less hot. The tea  is then placed in the store-houses, or packed in chests, and sent to  most of the countries in Europe and America.      Describe the appearance of the Tea-tree.    The Tea-tree when arrived at its full growth, which it does in about  seven years, is about a man's height; the green leaves are narrow, and  jagged all round; the flower resembles that of the wild rose, but is  smaller. The shrub loves to grow in valleys, at the foot of mountains,  and on the banks of rivers where it enjoys a southern exposure to the  sun; though it endures considerable variation of heat and cold, as it  flourishes in the northern clime of Pekin, where the winter is often  severe; and also about Canton, where the heat is sometimes very great.  The best tea, however, grows in a temperate climate, the country about  Nankin producing better tea than either Pekin or Canton, between which  two places it is situated.      What produces the difference between Green and Bohea, or Black?    There are varieties of the plant, and the difference of the tea arises  from the mode of preparation.      What nation first introduced it into Europe?    The Dutch in 1610; it was introduced into England in 1650      What is Coffee?    The berry of the coffee-tree, a native of Arabia. The coffee-tree is  an evergreen, and makes a beautiful appearance at all times of the  year, but especially when in "]]]
