For a flag; beneath and within its folds his welcome has  been measured and parsimonious;--a country; the construing and  application of its laws and remedies as applied to him, has inflicted  intolerable INJUSTICE: Has persecuted more often than blessed. And so  and thus, its perusal finished, its pages closed and laid aside, you are  shaken and swayed in your feelings, even as a tree, bent and riven  before the march and sweep of a mighty hurricane.           *       *       *       *       *    LOOKING BACKWARDS--    The spell of the book strong upon you, you see in your mind's eye,  thousands of plantations covering a fourth of a continent of a new and  virgin land. The toilers \"Black Folk\"; men, women and children--SLAVES!           *       *       *       *       *    YOU HEAR--    The crack of the \"driver's\" lash; the sullen bay of pursuing hounds.           *       *       *       *       *    JUST OVER YONDER--    Is the \"Auction Block\". You hear the moans and screams of mothers torn  from their offspring. You see them driven away, herded like cattle,  chained like convicts, sold to \"master's\" in the \"low lands\", to toil--    \"Midst the cotton and the cane.\"      YOU LISTEN--    Sounding far off, faint at first, growing louder each second, you hear  the beat of drums; the bugle's blast, sounding to arms; You see great  armies, moving hitherward and thitherward. Over one flies the Stars and  Stripes, over the other the Stars and Bars; a nation in arms! Brother  against brother!           *       *       *       *       *    YOU LOOK--    And lo, swinging past are many Black men; garbed in \"Blue\", keeping step  to the music of the Union. You see them fall and die, at Fort Pillow,  Fort Wagner, Petersburg, the Wilderness, Honey Hill--SLAUGHTERED! Above  the din; the boom of cannon, the rattle of small arms, the groans of the  wounded and dying, you hear the shout of one, as shattered and maimed he  is being borne from the field; \"BOYS, THE OLD FLAG NEVER TOUCHED THE  GROUND!\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE SCENE SHIFTS--    Fifty years have passed. You hear the clamor, the murmur and shouts of  gathering mobs. You see Black men and women hanging by their necks to  lamp posts, from the limbs of trees; in lonely spots--DEAD! You see  smoke curling upwards from BURNING HOMES! There are piles of cinders  and--DEAD MENS BONES!           *       *       *       *       *    NEARING ITS END--    The procession sweeps on. Staring you in the face; hailing from East,  West, North and South are banners; held aloft by unseen hands, bearing  on them--the quintessence of AMERICA'S INGRATITUDE,--these devices:         \"For American Negroes:       JIM CROW steam and trolley cars;       JIM CROW resident districts;       JIM CROW amen corners;       JIM CROW seats in theatres;       JIM CROW corners in cemeteries.\"    YOU MUTTER--    \"Are these indignities to CONTINUE? Is God DEAD?\"           *       *       *       *       *    COMES--    A voice. You listen!         \"WHEREFORE hear the word of the lord--       \"THE days of thy mourning shall be ended--       \"VIOLENCE shall no more be heard in the land--       \"NEITHER sorrow nor crying--       \"FOR the former things have passed away--       \"BEHOLD I make all things new--       \"ARISE, shine; for thy light has come.           *       *       *       *       *    HEREIN--    Lies the strength and worth of this unusual book, well and deservingly  named: A History of the American Negro in the Great World War. Beyond  merely recounting that story; than which there has been nothing finer or  more inspiring since the long away centuries when the chivalry of the  Middle Ages, in nodding plume and lance in rest, battled for the Holy  Sepulchre, it brings to the Negro of America a message of cheer and  reassurance. A sign, couched in flaming characters for all men to see,  appealing to the spiritualized divination of the age, proclaiming that  God is NOT DEAD! That a NEW day is dawning; HAS dawned for the Negro in  America. A NEW liberty; broader and BETTER. A NEW Justice, unshaded by  the spectre of: \"Previous condition!\" That the unpaid toil of thirty  decades of African slavery in America is at last to be liquidated. That  the dead of our people, upon behalf of this land that it might have a  BIRTH, and having it might not PERISH FROM THE EARTH, did not die in  vain. That, in their passage from earth, heroes--MARTYRS--in a  superlative sense they were seen and marked of the Father; were accorded  a place of record in the pages of the great WHITE BOOK with golden  seals, in the up worlds; above the stars and beyond the flaming suns.    IT IS A HISTORY--    That will be read with instruction and benefit by thousands of whites,  but, and mark well this suggestion, it is one that should be OWNED AND  READ BY EVERY NEGRO IN THE LAND.           *       *       *       *       *    TYPOGRAPHICALLY--    Mechanically; that is to say, in those features that reflect the  finished artistic achievement of the Print, Picture and Binding art; as  seen in the bold clear type of its text, its striking and beautiful  illustrations, its illuminating title heads of division and chapter;  indicating at a glance the information to follow; the whole appealing to  the aesthetic; the sticklers for the rare and beautiful; not overlooking  its superb binding, it is most pleasing to the sight, and worthy of the  title it bears.    [Illustration: signature]    HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO IN THE GREAT WORLD WAR        CHAPTER I.    SPIRITUAL EMANCIPATION OF NATIONS.      THE MARCH OF CIVILIZATION--WORLD SHOCKS TO STIR THE WORLD HEART--FALSE  DOCTRINES OF THE HUN--THE IRON HAND CONCEALED--THE WOBLD BEGINS TO  AWAKEN--GERMAN DESIGNS REVEALED--RUMBLINGS IN ADVANCE OF THE  STORM--TRAGEDY THAT HASTENED THE DAY--TOLSTOY'S PROPHECY--VINDICATION OF  NEGRO FAITH IN PROMISES OF THE LORD--DAWN OF FREEDOM FOR ALL RACES.      The march of civilization is attended by strange influences. Providence  which directs the advancement of mankind, moves in such mysterious ways  that none can sense its design or reason out its import. Frequently the  forces of evil are turned to account in defeating their own objects.  Great tragedies, cruel wars, cataclysms of woe, have acted as  enlightening and refining agents. Out of the famines of the past came  experiences which inculcated the thrift and fore-handedness of today.    Out of man's sufferings have come knowledge and fortitude. Out of pain  and tribulation, the attribute of sympathy--the first spiritual  manifestation instrumental in elevating the human above the beast.  Things worth while are never obtained without payment of some kind.    Individual shocks stir the individual heart and conscience. Great world  shocks are necessary to stir the world conscience and heart; to start  those movements to right the wrongs in the world. So long as peace  reigned commerce was uninterrupted, and the acquisition of wealth was  not obstructed, men cared little for the intrigues and ambitions of  royalty. If they sensed them at all, they lulled themselves into a  feeling of security through the belief that progress had attained too  far, civilization had secured too strong a hold, and democracy was too  firmly rooted for any ordinary menace to be considered.    So insidious and far reaching had become the inculcation of false  philosophies summed up in the general term Kultur, that the subjects of  the autocratic-ridden empires believed they were being guided by benign  influences. Many enlightened men; at least it seems they must have been  enlightened, in Germany and Austria--men who possessed liberated  intellects and were not in the pay of the Kulturists--professed to  believe that despotism in the modern world could not be other than  benevolent.    The satanic hand was concealed in the soft glove; the cloven hoof  artistically fitted into the military boot; the tail carefully tucked  inside the uniform or dress suit; fiendish eyes were taught to smile and  gleam in sympathy and humor, or were masked behind the heavy lenses of  professorial dignity; the serpent's hiss was trained to song, or drowned  in crashing chords and given to the world as a sublime harmony.    Suddenly the world awoke! The wooing harmony had changed to a blast of  war; the conductor's baton had become a bayonet; the soft wind  instrument barked the rifle's tone; its notes were bullets that hissed  and screamed; tinkling cymbals sounded the wild blare of carnage, and  sweet-throated horns of silver and brass bellowed the cannon's deadly  roar.    Civilization was so shocked that for long the exact sequence of events  was not comprehended. It required time and reflection to clear away the  brain benumbing vapors of the dream; to reach a realization that liberty  actually was tottering on her throne. German propagandists had been so  well organized, and so effectively did they spread their poison;  especially in the western world that great men; national leaders were  deceived, while men in general were slow to get the true perspective;  much later than those at the seat of government.    A few far-seeing men had been alive to the German menace. Some English  statesmen felt it in a vague way, while in France where the experience  of 1870-71, had produced a wariness of all things German, a limited  number of men with penetrating, broadened vision, had beheld the fair  exterior of Kaiserism, even while they recognized in the background, the  slimy abode of the serpent. For years they had sounded the warning until  at last their feeble voices attracted attention.

The  US Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data  codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.    Dates of information: The information cutoff date was 1 January 1997,  although a few important changes after that date have been included.  Most demographic statistics are estimates for 1997.    Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of deaths  during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude  death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the  mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current  mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly  affected by the age distribution, and most countries will eventually  show a rise in the rate, in spite of continued declines in mortality  at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt--external: This entry gives the total amount of public foreign  financial obligations.    Dependency status: This entry describes the formal relationship  between a nonindependent entity and a sovereign nation.    Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all  nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular  sovereign nation.    Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations  with 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN  members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,  and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with  6 nations that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,  Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Diplomatic representation from the US:  This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations. Diplomatic  representation in the US: This entry includes the chief of mission,  chancery address, telephone number, FAX number, consulate general  locations, consulate locations, honorary consulate general locations,  and honorary consulate locations.    Disputes--international: This entry includes a wide variety of  situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to  unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding  disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has  been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other  situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such  as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues,  however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.    Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official  development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is  defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,  has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of  LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions  are also official government assistance, but with a main objective  other than economic development and with a grant element less than  25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im  Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt  reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional  terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are  initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration  of intent. The entry is separated into two components--donor and  recipient.    Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the size,  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,  labor, and capital.    Economy--overview: This entry briefly describes the type of economy,  including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic  development, the most important natural resources, and the unique  areas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events  and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a  statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity--capacity: This entry gives the maximum designed potential  for electricity production expressed in kilowatts.    Electricity--consumption per capita: This entry gives the figure for  annual electricity generation plus net imports or minus net exports,  divided by total population for the same year expressed in kilowatt  hours.    Electricity--production: This entry gives the annual amount of  electricity actually generated expressed in kilowatt hours.    Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest point and the  lowest point.    Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. \"Nation\" refers to a people politically organized into a  sovereign state with a definite territory. \"Dependent area\" refers to  a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way  with a nation. \"Country\" names used in the table of contents or for  page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names and may include nations, dependencies, or  other geographic entities. There are a total of 266 separate  geographic entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as  follows:    NATIONS    184 nations that are UN members (excluding the former Yugoslavia,  which is still counted by the UN)  7 nations that are not members of the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,  Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu    OTHER    1 Taiwan    DEPENDENT AREAS    6 Australian dependencies--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas  Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and  McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island  2 Danish dependencies--Faroe Islands, Greenland  2 Dutch dependencies--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles  16 French dependencies--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa  Island, French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic  Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island, Martinique,  Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Tromelin  Island, Wallis and Futuna  3 New Zealand dependencies--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau  3 Norwegian dependencies--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard  1 Portuguese dependency--Macau  16 UK dependencies--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory,  British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar,  Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, Pitcairn  Islands, Saint Helena, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,  Turks and Caicos Islands  14 US dependencies--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland  Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands,  Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll, Puerto Rico,  Virgin Islands, Wake Island    MISCELLANEOUS      6 Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West  Bank, Western Sahara    OTHER ENTITIES      4 oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean    1 World  __________    266 Total    Environment--current issues: This entry lists the most pressing and  important environmental problems.    Environment--international agreements: This entry separates country  participation in international environmental agreements into two  levels--party to and signed but not ratified. Agreements are listed in  alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

In the US, the President is both the chief of state and  the head of government.    Exports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total  US dollar amount of exports on an f.o.b. basis. Commodities is a rank  ordering of exported products starting with the most important and  sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners is a rank  ordering of trading partners starting with the most important and  sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.
