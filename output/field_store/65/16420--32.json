His soldiers became  entangled in bogs and morasses; they fell into ambuscades; they  suffered every degree of privation and hardship for want of water and  of food, and were continually entrapped by their enemies in situations  where they had to fight in small numbers and at a great disadvantage.  Then, too, the aged and feeble general was kept in a continual fever  of anxiety and trouble by Bassianus, the son whom he had brought with  him to the north. The dissoluteness and violence of his character were  not changed by the change of scene. He formed plots and conspiracies  against his father's authority; he raised mutinies in the army; he  headed riots; and he was finally detected in a plan for actually  assassinating his father. Severus, when he discovered this last  enormity of wickedness, sent for his son to come to his imperial tent.  He laid a naked sword before him, and then, after bitterly reproaching  him with his undutiful and ungrateful conduct, he said, \"If you wish  to kill me, do it now. Here I stand, old, infirm, and helpless. You  are young and strong, and can do it easily. I am ready. Strike the  blow.\"    Of course Bassianus shrunk from his father's reproaches, and went  away without committing the crime to which he was thus reproachfully  invited; but his character remained unchanged; and this constant  trouble, added to all the other difficulties which Severus  encountered, prevented his accomplishing his object of thoroughly  conquering his northern foes. He made a sort of peace with them,  and retiring south to the line of fortified posts which had been  previously established, he determined to make it a fixed and certain  boundary by building upon it a permanent wall. He put the whole force  of his army upon the work, and in one or two years, as is said,  he completed the structure. It is known in history as the Wall of  Severus; and so solid, substantial, and permanent was the work, that  the traces of it have not entirely disappeared to the present day.    The wall extended across the island, from the mouth of the Tyne, on  the German Ocean, to the Solway Frith--nearly seventy miles. It was  twelve feet high, and eight feet wide. It was faced with substantial  masonry on both sides, the intermediate space being likewise filled  in with stone. When it crossed bays or morasses, piles were driven  to serve as a foundation. Of course, such a wall as this, by itself,  would be no defense. It was to be garrisoned by soldiers, being  intended, in fact, only as a means to enable a smaller number of  troops than would otherwise be necessary to guard the line. For these  soldiers there were built great fortresses at intervals along the  wall, wherever a situation was found favorable for such structures.  These were called _stations_. The stations were occupied by garrisons  of troops, and small towns of artificers and laborers soon sprung up  around them. Between the stations, at smaller intervals, were other  smaller fortresses called castles, intended as places of defense, and  rallying points in case of an attack, but not for garrisons of any  considerable number of men. Then, between the castles, at smaller  intervals still, were turrets, used as watch-towers and posts for  sentinels. Thus the whole line of the wall was every where defended  by armed men. The whole number thus employed in the defense of this  extraordinary rampart was said to be ten thousand. There was a broad,  deep, and continuous ditch on the northern side of the wall, to  make the impediment still greater for the enemy, and a spacious and  well-constructed military road on the southern side, on which troops,  stores, wagons, and baggage of every kind could be readily transported  along the line, from one end to the other.      [Illustration: WALL OF SEVERUS]    The wall was a good defense as long as Roman soldiers remained to  guard it. But in process of time--about two centuries after Severus's  day--the Roman empire itself began to decline, even in the very seat  and center of its power; and then, to preserve their own capital from  destruction, the government were obliged to call their distant armies  home. The wall was left to the Britons; but they could not defend it.  The Picts and Scots, finding out the change, renewed their assaults.  They battered down the castles; they made breaches here and there in  the wall; they built vessels, and, passing round by sea across the  mouth of the Solway Frith and of the River Tyne, they renewed their  old incursions for plunder and destruction. The Britons, in extreme  distress, sent again and again to recall the Romans to their aid, and  they did, in fact, receive from them some occasional and temporary  succor. At length, however, all hope of help from this quarter failed,  and the Britons, finding their condition desperate, were compelled to  resort to a desperate remedy, the nature of which will be explained in  the next chapter.    [Footnote 1: For some account of the circumstances connected with this  war see our history of Alexander, chapter vi.]          CHAPTER II.    THE ANGLO-SAXONS      Any one who will look around upon the families of his acquaintance  will observe that family characteristics and resemblances prevail not  only in respect to stature, form, expression of countenance, and other  outward and bodily tokens, but also in regard to the constitutional  temperaments and capacities of the soul. Sometimes we find a group in  which high intellectual powers and great energy of action prevail for  many successive generations, and in all the branches into which the  original stock divides; in other cases, the hereditary tendency is to  gentleness and harmlessness of character, with a full development of  all the feelings and sensibilities of the soul. Others, again, exhibit  congenital tendencies to great physical strength and hardihood, and  to powers of muscular exertion and endurance. These differences,  notwithstanding all the exceptions and irregularities connected with  them, are obviously, where they exist, deeply seated and permanent.  They depend very slightly upon any mere external causes. They have,  on the contrary, their foundation in some hidden principles connected  with the origin of life, and with the mode of its transmission from  parent to offspring, which the researches of philosophers have never  yet been able to explore.    These same constitutional and congenital peculiarities which we see  developing themselves all around us in families, mark, on a greater  scale, the characteristics of the different nations of the earth, and  in a degree much higher still, the several great and distinct races  into which the whole human family seems to be divided. Physiologists  consider that there are five of these great races, whose  characteristics, mental as well as bodily, are distinctly, strongly,  and permanently marked. These characteristics descend by hereditary  succession from father to son, and though education and outward  influences may modify them, they can not essentially change them.  Compare, for example, the Indian and the African races, each of which  has occupied for a thousand years a continent of its own, where they  have been exposed to the same variety of climates, and as far as  possible to the same general outward influences. How entirely diverse  from each other they are, not only in form, color, and other physical  marks, but in all the tendencies and characteristics of the soul! One  can no more be changed into the other, than a wolf, by being tamed and  domesticated, can be made a dog, or a dog, by being driven into the  forests, be transformed into a tiger. The difference is still greater  between either of these races and the Caucasian race. This race might  probably be called the European race, were it not that some Asiatic  and some African nations have sprung from it, as the Persians, the  Ph[oe]nicians, the Egyptians, the Carthaginians, and, in modern times,  the Turks. All the nations of this race, whether European or African,  have been distinguished by the same physical marks in the conformation  of the head and the color of the skin, and still more by those traits  of character--the intellect, the energy, the spirit of determination  and pride--which, far from owing their existence to outward  circumstances, have always, in all ages, made all outward  circumstances bend to them. That there have been some great and noble  specimens of humanity among the African race, for example, no one  can deny; but that there is a marked, and fixed, and permanent  constitutional difference between them and the Caucasian race seems  evident from this fact, that for two thousand years each has held its  own continent, undisturbed, in a great degree, by the rest of mankind;  and while, during all this time, no nation of the one race has risen,  so far as is known, above the very lowest stage of civilization,  there have been more than fifty entirely distinct and independent  civilizations originated and fully developed in the other. For  three thousand years the Caucasian race have continued, under all  circumstances, and in every variety of situation, to exhibit the  same traits and the same indomitable prowess. No calamities, however  great--no desolating wars, no destructive pestilence, no wasting  famine, no night of darkness, however universal and gloomy--has ever  been able to keep them long in degradation or barbarism. There is not  now a barbarous people to be found in the whole race, and there has  not been one for a thousand years.    Nearly all the great exploits, and achievements too, which have  signalized the history of the world, have been performed by this  branch of the human family. They have given celebrity to every age  in which they have lived, and to every country that they have ever  possessed, by some great deed, or discovery, or achievement, which  their intellectual energies have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#3)"],[1,"of good family\" who wish to  become Bodhisattvas.[10] The chief difference is that the  Bodhicaryavatara portrays a more spiritual life, it speaks more of  devotion, less of the million shapes that compose the heavenly host:  more of love and wisdom, less of the merits of reading particular  sutras. While rendering to it and the faith that produced it all  honour, we must remember that it is typical of the Mahayana only in  the sense that the De Imitatione Christi is typical of Roman  Catholicism, for both faiths have other sides.    Santideva's Bodhisattva, when conceiving the thought of Bodhi or  eventual supreme enlightenment to be obtained, it may be, only after  numberless births, feels first a sympathetic joy in the good actions  of all living beings. He addresses to the Buddhas a prayer which is  not a mere act of commemoration, but a request to preach the law and  to defer their entrance into Nirvana. He then makes over to others  whatever merit he may possess or acquire and offers himself and all  his possessions, moral and material, as a sacrifice for the salvation  of all beings. This on the one hand does not much exceed the limits of  _danam_ or the virtue of giving as practised by Sakyamuni in previous  births according to the Pali scriptures, but on the other it contains  in embryo the doctrine of vicarious merit and salvation through a  saviour. The older tradition admits that the future Buddha (_e.g._ in  the Vessantara birth-story) gives all that is asked from him including  life, wife and children. To consider the surrender and transfer of  merit (pattidana in Pali) as parallel is a natural though perhaps  false analogy. But the transfer of Karma is not altogether foreign to  Brahmanic thought, for it is held that a wife may share in her  husband's Karma nor is it wholly unknown to Sinhalese Buddhism.[11]  After thus deliberately rejecting all personal success and selfish  aims, the neophyte makes a vow (pranidhana) to acquire enlightenment  for the good of all beings and not to swerve from the rules of life  and faith requisite for this end. He is then a \"son of Buddha,\" a  phrase which is merely a natural metaphor for saying that he is one of  the household of faith[12] but still paves the way to later ideas  which make the celestial Bodhisattva an emanation or spiritual son of  a celestial Buddha.    Asanga gives[13] a more technical and scholastic description of the  ten _bhumis_ or stages which mark the Bodhisattva's progress towards  complete enlightenment and culminate in a phase bearing the remarkable  but ancient name of Dharmamegha known also to the Yoga philosophy. The  other stages are called: _mudita_ (joyful): _vimala_ (immaculate):  _prabhakari_ (light giving): _arcismati_ (radiant): _durjaya_ (hard to  gain): _abhimukhi_ (facing, because it faces both transmigration and  Nirvana): _duramgama_ (far-going): _acala_ (immovable): _sadhumati_  (good minded).    The incarnate Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Tibet are a travesty of the  Mahayana which on Indian soil adhered to the sound doctrine that  saints are known by their achievements as men and cannot be selected  among infant prodigies.[14] It was the general though not universal  opinion that one who had entered on the career of a Bodhisattva could  not fall so low as to be reborn in any state of punishment, but the  spirit of humility and self-effacement which has always marked the  Buddhist ideal tended to represent his triumph as incalculably  distant. Meanwhile, although in the whirl of births he was on the  upward grade, he yet had his ups and downs and there is no evidence  that Indian or Far Eastern Buddhists arrogated to themselves special  claims and powers on the ground that they were well advanced in the  career of Buddhahood. The vow to suppress self and follow the light  not only in this life but in all future births contains an element of  faith or fantasy, but has any religion formed a nobler or even  equivalent picture of the soul's destiny or built a better staircase  from the world of men to the immeasurable spheres of the superhuman?    One aspect of the story of Sakyamuni and his antecedent births thus  led to the idea that all may become Buddhas. An equally natural  development in another direction created celestial and superhuman  Bodhisattvas. The Hinayana held that Gotama, before his last birth,  dwelt in the Tushita heaven enjoying the power and splendour of an  Indian god and it looked forward to the advent of Maitreya. But it  admitted no other Bodhisattvas, a consequence apparently of the  doctrine that there can only be one Buddha at a time. But the  luxuriant fancy of India, which loves to multiply divinities, soon  broke through this restriction and fashioned for itself beautiful  images of benevolent beings who refuse the bliss of Nirvana that they  may alleviate the sufferings of others.[15] So far as we can judge,  the figures of these Bodhisattvas took shape just about the same time  that the personalities of Vishnu and Siva were acquiring consistency.  The impulse in both cases is the same, namely the desire to express in  a form accessible to human prayer and sympathetic to human emotion the  forces which rule the universe. But in this work of portraiture the  Buddhists laid more emphasis on moral and spiritual law than did the  Brahmans: they isolated in personification qualities not found  isolated in nature. Siva is the law of change, of death and rebirth,  with all the riot of slaughter and priapism which it entails: Vishnu  is the protector and preserver, the type of good energy warring  against evil, but the unity of the figure is smothered by mythology  and broken up into various incarnations. But Avalokita and Manjusri,  though they had not such strong roots in Indian humanity as Siva and  Vishnu, are genii of purer and brighter presence. They are the  personifications of kindness and knowledge. Though manifold in shape,  they have little to do with mythology, and are analogous to the  archangels of Christian and Jewish tradition and to the Amesha Spentas  of Zoroastrianism. With these latter they may have some historical  connection, for Persian ideas may well have influenced Buddhism about  the time of the Christian era. However difficult it may be to prove  the foreign origin of Bodhisattvas, few of them have a clear origin in  India and all of them are much better known in Central Asia and China.  But they are represented with the appearance and attributes of Indian  Devas, as is natural, since even in the Pali Canon Devas form the  Buddha's retinue. The early Buddhists considered that these spirits,  whether called Bodhisattvas or Devas, had attained their high position  in the same way as Sakyamuni himself, that is by the practice of moral  and intellectual virtues through countless existences, but  subsequently they came to be regarded as emanations or sons of  superhuman Buddhas. Thus the Karanda-vyuha relates how the original  Adi-Buddha produced Avalokita by meditation and how he in his turn  produced the universe with its gods.    Millions of unnamed Bodhisattvas are freely mentioned and even in the  older books copious lists of names are found,[16] but two, Avalokita  and Manjusri, tower above the rest, among whom only few have a  definite personality. The tantric school counts eight of the first  rank. Maitreya (who does not stand on the same footing as the others),  Samantabhadra, Mahasthana-prapta and above all Kshitigarbha, have some  importance, especially in China and Japan.    Avalokita[17] in many forms and in many ages has been one of the  principal deities of Asia but his origin is obscure. His main  attributes are plain. He is the personification of divine mercy and  pity but even the meaning of his name is doubtful. In its full form it  is Avalokitesvara, often rendered the Lord who looks down (from  heaven). This is an appropriate title for the God of Mercy, but the  obvious meaning of the participle _avalokita_ in Sanskrit is passive,  the Lord who is looked at. Kern[18] thinks it may mean the Lord who is  everywhere visible as a very present help in trouble, or else the Lord  of View, like the epithet Drishtiguru applied to Siva. Another form  of the name is Lokesvara or Lord of the world and this suggests that  _avalokita_ may be a synonym of _loka_, meaning the visible universe.  It has also been suggested that the name may refer to the small image  of Amitabha which is set in his diadem and thus looks down on him. But  such small images set in the head of a larger figure are not  distinctive of Avalokita: they are found in other Buddhist statues and  paintings and also outside India, for instance at Palmyra. The Tibetan  translation of the name[19] means he who sees with bright eyes. Hsuean  Chuang's rendering Kwan-tzu-tsai[20] expresses the same idea, but the  more usual Chinese translation Kuan-yin or Kuan-shih-yin, the deity  who looks upon voices or the region of voices, seems to imply a verbal  misunderstanding. For the use of Yin or voice makes us suspect that  the translator identified the last part of _Avalokitesvara_ not with  _Isvara_ lord but with _svara_ sound.[21]    Avalokitesvara is unknown to the Pali Canon and the Milinda Panha. So  far as I can discover he is not mentioned in the Divyavadana,  Jatakamala or any work attributed to Asvaghosha. His name does not  occur in the Lalita-vistara but a list of Bodhisattvas in its  introductory chapter includes Mahakarunacandin, suggesting  Mahakaruna, the Great Compassionate, which is one of his epithets. In  the Lotus[22] he is placed second in the introductory list of  Bodhisattvas after Manjusri. But Chapter XXIV, which is probably a  later addition, is dedicated to his praises as Samantamukha, he who  looks every way or the omnipresent. In this section his character as  the all-merciful saviour is fully developed. He saves those who call  on him from shipwreck, and execution, from"]]]
