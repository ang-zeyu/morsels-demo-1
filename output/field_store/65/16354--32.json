They approach the proteids in composition, but  unlike them they cannot form flesh or fulfil the same purpose in  nutrition. Some food chemists wish to call the osseids, albuminoids; what  were formerly termed albuminoids to be always spoken of as proteids only.    Jellies are of little use as food; not only is this because of the low  nutritive value of gelatin, but also on account of the small quantity  which is mixed with a large proportion of water.    The Vegetable Kingdom is the prime source of all organic food; water,  and to a slight extent salts, form the only food that animals can derive  directly from the inorganic kingdom. When man consumes animal food--a  sheep for example--he is only consuming a portion of the food which that  sheep obtained from grass, clover, turnips, &c. All the proteids of the  flesh once existed as proteids in the vegetables; some in exactly the same  chemical form.    Flesh contains no starch or sugar, but a small quantity of glycogen. The  fat in an animal is derived from the carbohydrates, the fats and the  proteids of the vegetables consumed. The soil that produced the herbage,  grain and roots consumed by cattle, in most cases could have produced food  capable of direct utilisation by man. By passing the product of the soil  through animals there is an enormous economic loss, as the greater part of  that food is dissipated in maintaining the life and growth; little remains  as flesh when the animal is delivered into the hands of the butcher. Some  imagine that flesh food is more easily converted into flesh and blood in  our bodies and is consequently more valuable than similar constituents in  vegetables, but such is not the case. Fat, whether from flesh or from  vegetables is digested in the same manner. The proteids of flesh, like  those of vegetables, are converted into peptone by the digestive  juices--taking the form of a perfectly diffusible liquid--otherwise they  could not be absorbed and utilised by the body. Thus the products of  digestion of both animal and vegetable proteids and fats are the same.  Formerly, proteid matter was looked upon as the most valuable part of the  food, and a large proportion was thought necessary for hard work. It was  thought to be required, not only for the construction of the muscle  substance, but to be utilised in proportion to muscular exertion. These  views are now known to be wrong. A comparatively small quantity of proteid  matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for the  general needs of the body. Increased muscular exertion requires but a  slight increase of this food constituent. It is the carbohydrates, or  carbohydrates and fats that should be eaten in larger quantity, as these  are the main source of muscular energy. The fact that animals, capable of  the most prolonged and powerful exertion, thrive on vegetables of  comparatively low proteid value, and that millions of the strongest races  have subsisted on what most Englishmen would consider a meagre vegetarian  diet, should have been sufficient evidence against the earlier view.    A comparison of flesh and vegetable food, shows in flesh an excessive  quantity of proteid matter, a very small quantity of glycogen (the animal  equivalent of starch and sugar) and a variable quantity of fat. Vegetable  food differs much, but as a rule it contains a much smaller quantity of  proteid matter, a large proportion of starch and sugar and a small  quantity of fat. Some vegetable foods, particularly nuts, contain much  fat.    Investigation of the digestive processes has shown that the carbohydrates  and fats entail little strain on the system; their ultimate products are  water and carbon dioxide, which are easily disposed of. The changes which  the proteids undergo in the body are very complicated. There is ample  provision in the body for their digestion, metabolism, and final  rejection, when taken in moderate quantity, as is the case in a dietary of  vegetables. The proteids in the human body, after fulfilling their  purpose, are in part expelled in the same way as the carbohydrates; but  the principal part, including all the nitrogen, is expelled by the kidneys  in the form of urea (a very soluble substance), and a small quantity of  uric acid in the form of quadurates.    There is reciprocity between the teeth and digestive organs of animals and  their natural food. The grasses, leaves, &c., which are consumed by the  herbivora, contain a large proportion of cellulose and woody tissue.  Consequently, the food is bulky; it is but slowly disintegrated and the  nutritious matter liberated and digested. The cellulose appears but  slightly acted upon by the digestive juices. The herbivora possess  capacious stomachs and the intestines are very long. The carnivora have  simpler digestive organs and short intestines. Even they consume  substances which leave much indigestible residue, such as skin, ligaments  and bones, but civilised man, when living on a flesh dietary removes as  much of such things as possible. The monkeys, apes, and man (comprised in  the order _Primates_) have a digestive canal intermediate in complexity  and in length to the herbivora and carnivora. A certain quantity of  indigestible matter is necessary for exciting peristaltic action of the  bowels. The carnivora with their short intestinal canal need the least,  the frugivora more, and the herbivora a much larger quantity. The  consumption by man of what is commonly called concentrated food is the  cause of the constipation to which flesh-eating nations are subject. Most  of the pills and other nostrums which are used in enormous quantities  contain aloes or other drugs which stimulate the action of the intestines.    Highly manufactured foods, from which as much as possible of the  non-nutritious matter has been removed is often advocated, generally by  those interested in its sale. Such food would be advantageous only if it  were possible to remove or modify a great part of our digestive canal (we  are omitting from consideration certain diseased conditions, when such  foods may be useful). The eminent physiologist and bacteriologist, Elie  Metchnikoff, has given it as his opinion that much of man's digestive  organs is not only useless but often productive of derangement and  disease. In several cases where it has been necessary, in consequence of  serious disease, to remove the entire stomach or a large part of the  intestines, the digestive functions have been perfectly performed. It is  not that our organs are at fault, but our habits of life differ from that  of our progenitors. In past times, when a simple dietary in which flesh  food formed little or no part, and to-day, in those countries where one  wholly or nearly all derived from vegetable sources and simply prepared is  the rule, diseases of the digestive organs are rare. The Englishman going  to a tropical country and partaking largely of flesh and alcohol, suffers  from disease of the liver and other organs, to which the natives and the  few of his own countrymen, living in accordance with natural laws are  strangers.    Indigestible Matter--Food is never entirely digested. As a reason  against confining ourselves solely to vegetable food, it has been stated  that such is less perfectly digested than animal food and that it  therefore throws more work on the digestive organs. It is also urged that  on this account a greater quantity of vegetable food is required. We have  shown elsewhere that, on the contrary, vegetarians are satisfied with a  smaller amount of food. Man requires a small quantity of woody fibre or  cellulose in his food to stimulate intestinal action and prevent  constipation.    It is difficult to determine how much of a food is unassimilated in the  body. This is for the reason of the intestinal refuse consisting not only  of undigested food, but also of residues of the digestive juices, mucus  and epithelial debris. These latter have been shown to amount to from  one-third to one-half of the whole of the faeces, which is much more than  had previously been supposed.    John Goodfellow has shown that of very coarse wholemeal bread quite 14 per  cent. was undigested, whilst bread made from ordinary grade wholemeal  showed 12.5 per cent. Such a method of analysis was adopted as it was  believed would exclude other than the food waste. The experiments were  made on a person who was eating nothing but the bread. It seems probable  that a smaller proportion would have remained unassimilated had the bread  not formed the sole food. It is advisable that wheatmeal he ground as  finely as possible, the coarse is not only to a less extent assimilated  but apt to irritate the bowels. Notwithstanding that fine white bread gave  only 4.2 per cent. and a coarse white bread 4.9 per cent. of waste, a fine  wheatmeal bread is more economical as the same quantity of wheat produces  a greater weight of flour richer in proteid and mineral matter. From a  large number of experiments with man, it has been calculated that of  proteids there is digested when animal food is eaten 98 per cent., from  cereals and sugars 8 per cent., from vegetables and fruits 80 per cent.  The difference between the proportions digested of the other food  constituents was much less. Although there is here a theoretical advantage  in favour of animal food, there are other considerations of far more  importance than a little undigestible waste. The main question is one of  health. In some dietary experiments of a girl aged 7, living upon a fruit  diet, of whom we have given some particulars elsewhere, Professor Jaffa  gives the following particulars. During the ten days trial the percentages  absorbed were proteids 82.5, fat 86.9, nitrogen free extract 96, crude  fibre 80, ash 5.7, heat of combustion in calories 86.7. He says,  \"generally speaking, the food was quite thoroughly assimilated, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#3)"],[1,"of mutual goodwill  the conditions most favourable for the development of civilisation and  commerce, a Conference was arranged at Berlin by Prince Bismarck. All  the Powers of Europe and the United States of America sent  plenipotentiaries who sat from November 15th 1884 to February 26th 1885  and agreed to the General Act of Berlin of the latter date. In this it  is decreed that all nations should enjoy complete liberty of commerce in  all the territories constituting the basin of the Congo and its  tributaries, and also in other parts of Central Africa mentioned, that  slavery should be abolished and that the Congo river should be open to  general navigation.    We shall have to refer to this Treaty later, but it is important to note  here that the United States of America and all the great Powers of  Europe had recognised the International Association as an Independent  State before it was signed. Furthermore, before this date, Conventions  had been signed with France and Portugal to arrange the frontiers  between the territories of those Powers and the International  Association. The General Act of Berlin had however nothing to do with  frontiers at all, but stated the general principles which it seemed were  best suited to the needs of the people and territories in Central  Africa, to which all the African Powers, and among them the  International Association, voluntarily agreed. It is therefore clear  that the clauses of the Act apply to all the Powers in the territories  defined, and that the Act itself was not concerned with founding or  regulating the system of Government of the International Association,  which six months later took the name of the _Etat Independant du Congo_  with His Majesty Ring Leopold II. as sovereign.    While engaged in studying these treaties, we arrived at Free Town,  Sierra Leone on July 5th. Here again the place forms a beautiful picture  from the sea. A reef runs far out and is marked by a lighthouse, while  the town itself, protected by a fort with grass ramparts, lies on the  south side of a kind of bay, which, however, has more the appearance of  the mouth of a large river. Palms and other tropical plants grow to the  water's edge and among them are yellow and red houses while higher up  the hills behind, are isolated bungalows and the barracks, at this time  occupied by the West African regiment. In the distance, bleak and bare  mountains passively regard the scene. On landing, one meets faces  showing every shade from ivory white to jet black and clothes of every  known colour. The roads are not paved in any way, as there are neither  horses nor wheeled vehicles here. Indeed, the houses are built in rows  facing each other, a gutter is cut in front and the space between forms  a street. The Custom House is an imposing structure near the beach and  the Cathedral is a handsome Gothic church, but as one end was covered  with scaffolding, it was not looking its best. A light railway runs up  the hill to the barracks of the native regiment and a special train was  arranged for the passengers of the _Leopoldville_.    Hotel accommodation in Sierra Leone is, like the demand for it, limited.  It is, however, possible to obtain a meal at the _Victoria_. Altogether  Free Town leaves the impression that it could be developed into a most  attractive watering place if it were nearer Europe and had a better  climate.    It is now getting rather hot and tropical, while the sea is as smooth as  a mirror and equally reflects the glare.    I continue to read up the Congo controversy. The report of Mr. Casement,  at one time British Consul at Boma, created quite a sensation when it  appeared. He stated that the Congo Free State had granted concessions to  Trading Companies, which is a fact, and that the agents of these  companies compelled the natives by force to collect rubber, which  however, he does not attempt to prove by his own experience, but relies  entirely upon reports of natives and hearsay evidence. He quoted one  case which illustrates the extreme difficulty of discovering the truth  from natives. He examined a boy named Epondo who stated that his left  hand had been cut off by a native sentry. Not knowing the native  dialect, Mr. Casement employed an interpreter, but he was convinced by  the manner and gestures of the villagers that the boy's story was true.  When the report appeared, the boy was again examined by some officials  of the State, when he at once contradicted the first statement and said  that his arm and hand had been severely bitten by a wild boar when he  was a child and that the hand afterwards fell off. Now one of these  tales is obviously false and there is evidence to show which, for the  scar of a clean cut wound is different from that following gangrene.  However, at this time I had not seen the boy, so of course could give no  opinion. This is the only case of reputed mutilation which could be  discovered for the benefit of Mr. Casement and was a very unfortunate  example of an atrocity, for in the first place it was the _left_ hand  that was missing and the soldiers were supposed always to cut off the  _right_, and in the second, there was great doubt whether it was the  result of an accident or not.    We were now coasting off Liberia and Captain Sparrow who was in command  of the _Leopoldville_ cheered us up with the statement that the charts  of this part had not been revised for eighty years, that there were many  rocks and that ships frequently went ashore here. Wreckers then went out  and looted everything on board. It is not therefore, a pleasant place in  which to make an enforced landing.    Liberia itself however, must be interesting to visit, for it is an  independent republic of negroes with an elected President, Senate and  House of Representatives. It sells palm oil to other countries and buys  alcohol, arms and ammunition, thus exchanging a peaceful luminant and  lubricant for the elements of moral and physical strife. Fortunately no  rocks appear through the bottom of the ship and Commandant Sillye  relieves the monotony of the voyage by describing the Constitution of  the Congo State, which however, like other constitutions, is  occasionally revised. At its head is the Sovereign of the State aided by  Ministers at Brussels, next in rank comes the Governor-General and  Vice-Governor-Generals, one of whom is always at Boma. There are also  Royal Commissioners and Inspectors of the State who are very high  officials, but whose duties are not easily defined. The whole country is  divided into Districts which are governed by District Commissioners. The  Districts are divided into zones ruled by zone chiefs under the control  of the District Commissioners. Finally the Posts and Stations are  commanded by Post-Commanders. All these may be described as civil  administrative officials who, subject to the general system and laws  have practical control over more or less limited areas. The officers of  the Force Publique rank as Commandant, Captain, Lieutenant and  Under-Lieutenant, and there are also several white non-commissioned  officers. The natives rank as sergeants, corporals and privates.    On July 8th we arrive at Sekondi, Gold Coast Colony. The town from the  sea seems to consist of white houses and huts with the usual red roofs.  On a hillock near the shore is an old Dutch fort now used as a  signalling station, and on the left, half way up a hill, an hotel has  been built. The place is not very pretty or attractive-looking for there  is not much colour and no mountains are visible. We anchor some distance  from the beach and several open boats at once put off. These are each  propelled by ten or twelve natives, who sit on the sides of the boat and  ply their paddles, lustily singing as they work together and with a  will. The paddles are shaped somewhat like those of a Canadian canoe,  except that the blade is star shaped. All the cargo is swung overboard  into these boats or canoes as they are called, and the passengers are  lowered in a kind of chair. As there is a heavy ground swell running,  the canoes are bobbing up and down like corks alongside. The chair is  suspended in mid air and lowered rapidly as the canoe washes up, while  all hope that it and its occupant will descend at the right moment.    One of the passengers was an English officer, Captain Wheeler, with whom  we had played many games of deck cricket on the voyage. First his  regulation seventy cubic feet of baggage was lowered--an extraordinary  amount, for no one without the aid of a slide rule and logarithms could  possibly calculate it--and then he himself made the perilous  descent--without a ducking. He would next have 240 miles of train  journey to Coomassie and then a walk--or rather a journey in a  hammock--for another 300 miles to his station.    We now travel parallel to the Gold Coast which looks hot and uninviting,  for there are but few patches of green or trees until Cape Coast Castle  is reached. Here is a fort which must have impressed natives and slave  dealers greatly in the past, a few houses and an imposing looking  church dotted in the red sand. The whole line of the Coast here,  somewhat recalls the Atlantic sea board of Georgia, U.S.A. and the towns  look as though they would be as hot as Aden at its best or rather worst.    After leaving the Gold Coast, our course is shaped across the Bight of  Benin straight for the Congo. There is plenty of time therefore, to  study the system of justice in the Congo. This, like everything else in  the country, is essentially simple and practical. There is a Court of  Premiere Instance at Boma and others called Territorial Courts at  Matadi, Stanley Pool, East Kwango, The Equator, Bangalas, Aruwimi,  Stanley Falls and Kassai[1]. In each Court is a Judge, an Officer of the  Public Ministry and a Registrar, but in the Territorial Courts, the  judge may assume the functions of all. These courts hear"]]]
