Mrs. Marshall's social position was unquestioned, and  wealth showered every dainty on this child which was idolized with its  brothers and sisters by its white papa. In course of time another child  appeared on the scene, but it was unmistakably dark. All were alarmed, and  \"rush of blood, strangulation\" were the conjectures, but the doctor, when  asked the cause, grimly told them it was a Negro child. There was a family  conclave, the coachman heard of it and leaving his own family went West,  and has never returned. As soon as Mrs. Marshall was able to travel she  was sent away in deep disgrace. Her husband died within the year of a  broken heart.    Ebenzer Fowler, the wealthiest colored man in Issaquena County, Miss., was  shot down on the street in Mayersville, January 30, 1885, just before dark  by an armed body of white men who filled his body with bullets. They  charged him with writing a note to a white woman of the place, which they  intercepted and which proved there was an intimacy existing between them.    Hundreds of such cases might be cited, but enough have been given to prove  the assertion that there are white women in the South who love the  Afro-American's company even as there are white men notorious for their  preference for Afro-American women.    There is hardly a town in the South which has not an instance of the kind  which is well known, and hence the assertion is reiterated that \"nobody in  the South believes the old thread bare lie that negro men rape white  women.\" Hence there is a growing demand among Afro-Americans that the  guilt or innocence of parties accused of rape be fully established. They  know the men of the section of the country who refuse this are not so  desirous of punishing rapists as they pretend. The utterances of the  leading white men show that with them it is not the crime but the _class_.  Bishop Fitzgerald has become apologist for lynchers of the rapists of  _white_ women only. Governor Tillman, of South Carolina, in the month of  June, standing under the tree in Barnwell, S.C., on which eight  Afro-Americans were hung last year, declared that he would lead a mob to  lynch a _negro_ who raped a _white_ woman. So say the pulpits, officials  and newspapers of the South. But when the victim is a colored woman it is  different.    Last winter in Baltimore, Md., three white ruffians assaulted a Miss  Camphor, a young Afro-American girl, while out walking with a young man of  her own race. They held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed  dastardly enough to arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape  as excuse for lawlessness, but she was an Afro-American. The case went to  the courts, an Afro-American lawyer defended the men and they were  acquitted.    In Nashville, Tenn., there is a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged a  little Afro-American girl, and, from the physical injuries received, she  has been ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is  now a detective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man  outraged an Afro-American girl in a drug store. He was arrested, and  released on bail at the trial. It was rumored that five hundred  Afro-Americans had organized to lynch him. Two hundred and fifty white  citizens armed themselves with Winchesters and guarded him. A cannon was  placed in front of his home, and the Buchanan Rifles (State Militia)  ordered to the scene for his protection. The Afro-American mob did not  materialize. Only two weeks before Eph. Grizzard, who had only been  _charged_ with rape upon a white woman, had been taken from the jail, with  Governor Buchanan and the police and militia standing by, dragged through  the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged into him at every step, and  with every fiendish cruelty a frenzied mob could devise, he was at last  swung out on the bridge with hands cut to pieces as he tried to climb up  the stanchions. A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the  nineteenth-century civilization of the Athens of the South! No cannon or  military was called out in his defense. He dared to visit a white woman.    At the very moment these civilized whites were announcing their  determination \"to protect their wives and daughters,\" by murdering  Grizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old  Maggie Reese, an Afro-American girl. He was not harmed. The \"honor\" of  grown women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and  Ed Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were  white. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this  case; she was black.    A white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months ago inflicted such  injuries upon another Afro-American child that she died. He was not  punished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to  lynch an Afro-American who visited a white woman.    In Memphis, Tenn., in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the  husband of Russell Hancock's widow, was arrested for attempted rape on  Mattie Cole, a neighbors cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing  his purpose, by the appearance of Mattie's employer. Dorr's friends say he  was drunk and not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to  indict him and he was discharged.          3 _The_ NEW CRY      The appeal of Southern whites to Northern sympathy and sanction, the  adroit, insiduous plea made by Bishop Fitzgerald for suspension of  judgment because those \"who condemn lynching express no sympathy for the  _white_ woman in the case,\" falls to the ground in the light of the  foregoing.    From this exposition of the race issue in lynch law, the whole matter is  explained by the well-known opposition growing out of slavery to the  progress of the race. This is crystalized in the oft-repeated slogan:  \"This is a white man's country and the white man must rule.\" The South  resented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the  Civil Rights Law. The raids of the Ku-Klux and White Liners to subvert  reconstruction government, the Hamburg and Ellerton, S.C., the Copiah  County, Miss., and the Layfayette Parish, La., massacres were excused as  the natural resentment of intelligence against government by ignorance.    Honest white men practically conceded the necessity of intelligence  murdering ignorance to correct the mistake of the general government, and  the race was left to the tender mercies of the solid South. Thoughtful  Afro-Americans with the strong arm of the government withdrawn and with  the hope to stop such wholesale massacres urged the race to sacrifice its  political rights for sake of peace. They honestly believed the race should  fit itself for government, and when that should be done, the objection to  race participation in politics would be removed.    But the sacrifice did not remove the trouble, nor move the South to  justice. One by one the Southern States have legally(?) disfranchised the  Afro-American, and since the repeal of the Civil Rights Bill nearly every  Southern State has passed separate car laws with a penalty against their  infringement. The race regardless of advancement is penned into filthy,  stifling partitions cut off from smoking cars. All this while, although  the political cause has been removed, the butcheries of black men at  Barnwell, S.C., Carrolton, Miss., Waycross, Ga., and Memphis, Tenn., have  gone on; also the flaying alive of a man in Kentucky, the burning of one  in Arkansas, the hanging of a fifteen-year-old girl in Louisiana, a woman  in Jackson, Tenn., and one in Hollendale, Miss., until the dark and bloody  record of the South shows 728 Afro-Americans lynched during the past eight  years. Not fifty of these were for political causes; the rest were for all  manner of accusations from that of rape of white women, to the case of the  boy Will Lewis who was hanged at Tullahoma, Tenn., last year for being  drunk and \"sassy\" to white folks.    These statistics compiled by the _Chicago Tribune_ were given the first of  this year (1892). Since then, not less than one hundred and fifty have  been known to have met violent death at the hands of cruel bloodthirsty  mobs during the past nine months.    To palliate this record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes  intelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained  the history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the  plausible screen of defending the honor of its women. This, too, in the  face of the fact that only _one-third_ of the 728 victims to mobs have  been _charged_ with rape, to say nothing of those of that one-third who  were innocent of the charge. A white correspondent of the _Baltimore Sun_  declares that the Afro-American who was lynched in Chestertown, Md., in  May for assault on a white girl was innocent; that the deed was done by a  white man who had since disappeared. The girl herself maintained that her  assailant was a white man. When that poor Afro-American was murdered, the  whites excused their refusal of a trial on the ground that they wished to  spare the white girl the mortification of having to testify in court.    This cry has had its effect. It has closed the heart, stifled the  conscience, warped the judgment and hushed the voice of press and pulpit  on the subject of lynch law throughout this \"land of liberty.\" Men who  stand high in the esteem of the public for Christian character, for moral  and physical courage, for devotion to the principles of equal and exact  justice to all, and for great sagacity, stand as cowards who fear to open  their mouths before this great outrage.

It was nearly 2  o'clock in the morning when a large detail of police surrounded the block  with the intent to kill Charles on sight. Capt. Day had charge of the  squad of police. Charles, the wounded man, was in his house when the  police arrived, fully prepared, as results afterward showed, to die in his  own home. Capt. Day started for Charles's room. As soon as Charles got  sight of him there was a flash, a report, and Day fell dead in his tracks.  In another instant Charles was standing in the door, and seeing Patrolman  Peter J. Lamb, he drew his gun, and Lamb fell dead. Two other officers,  Sergeant Aucoin and Officer Trenchard, who were in the squad, seeing their  comrades, Day and Lamb, fall dead, concluded to raise the siege, and both  disappeared into an adjoining house, where they blew out their lights so  that their cowardly carcasses could be safe from Charles's deadly aim. The  calibre of their courage is well shown by the fact that they concluded to  save themselves from any harm by remaining prisoners in that dark room  until daybreak, out of reach of Charles's deadly rifle. Sergeant Aucoin,  who had been so brave a few hours before when seeing the two colored men  sitting on the steps, talking together on Dryades Street, and supposing  that neither was armed, now showed his true calibre. Now he knew that  Charles had a gun and was brave enough to use it, so he hid himself in a  room two hours while Charles deliberately walked out of his room and into  the street after killing both Lamb and Day. It is also shown, as further  evidence of the bravery of some of New Orleans' \"finest,\" that one of  them, seeing Capt. Day fall, ran seven blocks before he stopped,  afterwards giving the excuse that he was hunting for a patrol box.    At daybreak the officers felt safe to renew the attack upon Charles, so  they broke into his room, only to find that--what they probably very well  knew--he had gone. It appears that he made his escape by crawling through  a hole in the ceiling to a little attic in his house. Here he found that  he could not escape except by a window which led into an alley, which had  no opening on 4th Street. He scaled the fence and was soon out of reach.    It was now 5 o'clock Tuesday morning, and a general alarm was given.  Sergeant Aucoin and Corporal Trenchard, having received a new supply of  courage by returning daylight, renewed their effort to capture the man  that they had allowed to escape in the darkness. Citizens were called upon  to participate in the man hunt and New Orleans was soon the scene of  terrible excitement. Officers were present everywhere, and colored men  were arrested on all sides upon the pretext that they were impertinent and  \"game niggers.\" An instance is mentioned in the _Times-Democrat_ of the  twenty-fifth and shows the treatment which unoffending colored men  received at the hands of some of the officers. This instance shows  Corporal Trenchard, who displayed such remarkable bravery on Monday night  in dodging Charles's revolver, in his true light. It shows how brave a  white man is when he has a gun attacking a Negro who is a helpless  prisoner. The account is as follows:      The police made some arrests in the neighborhood of the killing of the    two officers. Mobs of young darkies gathered everywhere. These Negroes    talked and joked about the affair, and many of them were for starting a    race war on the spot. It was not until several of these little gangs    amalgamated and started demonstrations that the police commenced to    act. Nearly a dozen arrests were made within an hour, and everybody in    the vicinity was in a tremor of excitement.      It was about 1 o'clock that the Negroes on Fourth Street became very    noisy, and George Meyers, who lives on Sixth Street, near Rampart,    appeared to be one of the prime movers in a little riot that was rapidly    developing. Policeman Exnicios and Sheridan placed him under arrest, and    owing to the fact that the patrol wagon had just left with a number of    prisoners, they walked him toward St. Charles Avenue in order to get a    conveyance to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.      A huge crowd of Negroes followed the officers and their prisoners.    Between Dryades and Baronne, on Sixth, Corporal Trenchard met the trio.    He had his pistol in his hand and he came on them running. The Negroes    in the wake of the officers, and prisoner took to flight immediately.    Some disappeared through gates and some over fences and into yards, for    Trenchard, visibly excited, was waving his revolver in the air and was    threatening to shoot. He joined the officers in their walk toward St.    Charles Street, and the way he acted led the white people who were    witnessing the affair to believe that his prisoner was the wanted Negro.    At every step he would punch him or hit him with the barrel of his    pistol, and the onlookers cried, \"Lynch him!\" \"Kill him!\" and other    expressions until the spectators were thoroughly wrought up. At St.    Charles Street Trenchard desisted, and, calling an empty ice wagon,    threw the Negro into the body of the vehicle and ordered Officer    Exnicios to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.      The ride to the station was a wild one. Exnicios had all he could do to    watch his prisoner. A gang climbed into the wagon and administered a    terrible thrashing to the black en route. It took a half hour to reach    the police station, for the mule that was drawing the wagon was not    overly fast. When the station was reached a mob of nearly 200 howling    white youths was awaiting it. The noise they made was something    terrible. Meyers was howling for mercy before he reached the ground. The    mob dragged him from the wagon, the officer with him. Then began a    torrent of abuse for the unfortunate prisoner.      The station door was but thirty feet away, but it took Exnicios nearly    five minutes to fight his way through the mob to the door. There were no    other officers present, and the station seemed to be deserted. Neither    the doorman nor the clerk paid any attention to the noise on the    outside. As the result, the maddened crowd wrought their vengeance on    the Negro. He was punched, kicked, bruised and torn. The clothes were    ripped from his back, while his face after that few minutes was    unrecognizable.    This was the treatment accorded and permitted to a helpless prisoner  because he was black. All day Wednesday the man hunt continued. The  excitement caused by the deaths of Day and Lamb became intense. The  officers of the law knew they were trailing a man whose aim was deadly and  whose courage they had never seen surpassed. Commenting upon the  marksmanship of the man which the paper styled a fiend, the  _Times-Democrat_ of Wednesday said:      One of the extraordinary features of the tragedy was the marksmanship    displayed by the Negro desperado. His aim was deadly and his coolness    must have been something phenomenal. The two shots that killed Captain    Day and Patrolman Lamb struck their victims in the head, a circumstance    remarkable enough in itself, considering the suddenness and fury of the    onslaught and the darkness that reigned in the alley way.      Later on Charles fired at Corporal Perrier, who was standing at least    seventy-five yards away. The murderer appeared at the gate, took    lightning aim along the side of the house, and sent a bullet whizzing    past the officer's ear. It was a close shave, and a few inches'    deflection would no doubt have added a fourth victim to the list.      At the time of the affray there is good reason to believe that Charles    was seriously wounded, and at any event he had lost quantities of blood.    His situation was as critical as it is possible to imagine, yet he shot    like an expert in a target range. The circumstance shows the desperate    character of the fiend, and his terrible dexterity with weapons makes    him one of the most formidable monsters that has ever been loose upon    the community.    Wednesday New Orleans was in the hands of a mob. Charles, still sought for  and still defending himself, had killed four policemen, and everybody knew  that he intended to die fighting. Unable to vent its vindictiveness and  bloodthirsty vengeance upon Charles, the mob turned its attention to other  colored men who happened to get in the path of its fury. Even colored  women, as has happened many times before, were assaulted and beaten and  killed by the brutal hoodlums who thronged the streets. The reign of  absolute lawlessness began about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. The mob  gathered near the Lee statue and was soon making its way to the place  where the officers had been shot by Charles. Describing the mob, the  _Times-Democrat_ of Thursday morning says:      The gathering in the square, which numbered about 700, eventually became    in a measure quiet, and a large, lean individual, in poor attire and    with unshaven face, leaped upon a box that had been brought for the    purpose, and in a voice that under no circumstances could be heard at a    very great distance, shouted: \"Gentlemen, I am the Mayor of Kenner.\" He    did not get a chance for some minutes to further declare himself, for    the voice of the rabble swung over his like a huge wave over a sinking    craft. He stood there, however, wildly waving his arms and demanded a    hearing, which was given him when the uneasiness of the mob was quieted    for a moment or so.      \"I am from Kenner, gentlemen, and I have come down to New Orleans    tonight to assist you in teaching the blacks a lesson. I have killed a    Negro before, and in revenge of the wrong wrought upon you and yours, I    am willing to kill again. The only way that you can teach these Niggers    a lesson and put them in their place is to go out and lynch a few of    them as an object lesson. String up a few of them,"]]]
