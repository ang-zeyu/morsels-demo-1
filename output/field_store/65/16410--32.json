Beneath its  floors lie buried eight Governors of the Colony, the last one being Ryk  Tulbagh, who was buried in 1771.    No account of Cape Town would be complete without a reference to the  important Harbour Works, and Breakwater, which at once attract the  attention of the visitor, and which have been in course of erection for  several years past, from the designs of Sir John Coode. These works  have been of the greatest importance in extending, and developing the  commercial advantages of the port. The Graving Dock now named the  Robinson, after the late Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, was formally  opened during the year 1882, and it so happened that the first vessel to  enter it was the _Athenian_, in which I returned to England, at the  termination of my tour. The whole of the works connected with the  building of the Docks and Breakwater reflect credit upon all who have in  any way been engaged upon their construction. The amount expended on  them up to the end of 1887 was L1,298,103.    Before leaving Cape Town, at the invitation of the Naval  Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Wells, I paid a visit to Simon's Town, the  chief naval station of the colony. The railway runs at present as far  as Kalk Bay, which takes about an hour to get to from Cape Town. Kalk  Bay is a pleasant seaside resort for the inhabitants of the colony, the  air being regarded as particularly invigorating. The remaining distance  of six miles to Simon's Town is performed in a Cape cart, which is a  most comfortable vehicle on two wheels, drawn by two horses with a pole  between them, and covered with a hood, as a protection from the weather.  The scenery from the Kalk Bay station to Simon's Town is very  picturesque. A bold sea stretches out on one side of the road, and the  mountain on the other. Amongst other things which attracted my attention  at Simon's Town was the Dockyard, which embraces about a mile of the  foreshore, and contains appliances for repairing modern war vessels, a  repairing and victualling depot, and a patent slip, capable of lifting  vessels of about 900 tons displacement. I went with the Admiral, and a  party of ladies to have luncheon on board the Steam Corvette _Archer_.    Simon's Bay is very sheltered, excepting from the south-east, with good  holding anchorage ground. It seems a quiet, secluded spot, well-adapted  for a naval station in this part of the world, although I have heard  that an opinion prevails that the fleet should be at Cape Town instead  of Simon's Bay. The _Raleigh_ is the flag-ship; I saw also some other  vessels of the Royal Navy at anchor in the bay. The fortifications which  are now in progress for the protection of this important point in our  chain of defences will, when completed, render the place practically  impregnable from sea attack.    Some of the most beautiful coast scenery I have ever seen is to be found  in that very lovely drive by Sea Point to Hout's Bay, and thence back to  Cape Town by Constantia and Wynberg. This is a celebrated excursion,  and well deserves the praises bestowed upon it. The road has been  admirably constructed by convict labour.    A very convenient short line of railway also brings within easy reach of  the inhabitants of Cape Town the pretty villages of Mowbray, Rondebosch,  Rosebank, Newlands, Wynberg, Constantia, &c., where, in charming villas  and other residences, so many of the wealthier classes reside. At  Constantia the principal wine farms are situated, the most noted being  the Groot Constantia (the Government farm) and High Constantia.  Constantia wine can only be produced on these farms. Another farm in  this neighbourhood is Witteboomen, which is particularly noted for its  peaches, there being over one thousand trees on the farm, in addition to  many other kinds of fruit. Another one, and probably the largest in the  district, is named \"Sillery.\" Here not many years ago the ground was a  wilderness, but it has now attained a high state of perfection, there  being at least 140,000 vines and hundreds of fruit trees of all kinds,  under cultivation.    At Cape Town I received the first proofs of the kind and lavish  attentions which everywhere in South Africa were subsequently bestowed  upon me. From everyone, without exception--from His Excellency the  Administrator and Mrs. Smyth, and the members of his staff--from all the  public men and high officials--from members of the Cape Government, and  from the leaders of the Opposition, besides from innumerable private  friends, Dutch and English alike, I received such cordial tokens of  goodwill, that I can only express my deep sense of appreciation of their  most genial and friendly hospitality. I bid adieu to Cape Town (which I  was visiting for the first time in my life) with the conviction that I  was truly in a land, not of strangers, but of real friends, who desired  to do everything in their power to make my visit to South Africa  pleasant and agreeable to me; and this impression I carried with me ever  afterwards at every place I visited during the whole of my tour.    On Wednesday, May 29, I left Cape Town at 6.30 p.m. for Kimberley,  passing Beaufort West, the centre of an extensive pastoral district, and  De Aar, the railway junction from Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. This  journey is a long one, of between 600 and 700 miles, and of some  forty-two hours by railway. I travelled all through that night, and the  whole of the next day, through the most remarkable kind of country I  ever saw. Flat, and apparently as level, as a bowling-green (although we  were continually rising from our starting-point at Cape Town to a  height at Kimberley of about 3,800 feet above the sea), a sandy and  dreary desert, with occasionally low, and barren hills in the far  distance--not a tree to be seen, and scarcely any vestige of vegetation,  excepting now and then, a few of the indigenous Mimosa shrubs, which,  for hundreds of miles, grow fitfully on this desolate soil. This is the  wonderful tract of country called the Great Karoo. Not a sign of animal  life is to be detected, at this period of the year. During the summer  months it affords pasturage for large flocks of sheep. It is a vast  interminable _sea of lone land_, over which the eye wanders unceasingly  during the whole of the daylight hours.    [Illustration: Decorative]    [Footnote A: The First Series was published in 1887.]          [Illustration: Decorative]    KIMBERLEY.      After another long night in the railway train, at noon on the second  day, after leaving Cape Town, I reached the celebrated diamond town of  Kimberley, the population of which consists of about 6,000 Europeans,  with a native population estimated at about 10,000, chiefly concentrated  in the mining area.    On my arrival at the railway station, I was met by the Mayor, and a  deputation of the residents of the town. At a conversazione held later,  and which was attended by over four hundred ladies and gentlemen, the  following address was presented to me by the Fellows of the Royal  Colonial Institute resident at Kimberley and Beaconsfield:--         \"Kimberley, _June 1st_, 1889.         \"To SIR FREDERICK YOUNG, K.C.M.G.         \"A Vice-President of the Royal Colonial Institute.         \"DEAR SIR,--We, the Fellows of the Royal Colonial Institute,       resident in the towns and mining centres of Kimberley, and       Beaconsfield, South Africa, cordially welcome your arrival amongst       us.         \"We are persuaded that your visit to this distant part of Her       Majesty's Dominions has been undertaken, not merely for personal       pleasure, but also on behalf of the great and growing need for the       consolidation and expansion of colonial interests throughout the       Empire.         \"We feel that your own career has been an important factor in the       formation of a sound public opinion on this subject, and that it       is largely through your patient and far-seeing efforts, that the       Royal Colonial Institute has attained its present proud position       amongst the various, influences, moulding, organising, and guiding       the life and destinies of Her Majesty's Colonial Empire.         \"We believe the present time to be vitally important in the history       of Her Majesty's Dominions in South Africa. The tide of       confederation, and corporate union is manifestly rising, the wave       of extended British influence is flowing northwards, the various       nationalities and states of this vast country are educating       themselves by experience to see the folly and sterile weakness of       isolation, and are learning to realise the inherent strength, and       vitality of mutual co-operation, based on a self respecting, yet       unselfish responsibility to South Africa as a whole.         \"We venture to suggest that this growing feeling for co-operation       will prove a valuable element in the growth, and formation in the       near future, of one Grand Confederation of all countries and       peoples, owing allegiance to, or claiming corporate alliance with,       Her Britannic Majesty's Empire.         \"We rejoice, as members of the Royal Colonial Institute, that your       personal merits and public career have been recognised by Her       Majesty in the honour conferred upon you, which we trust you will       enjoy for many years.         \"Coming amongst us as a Vice-President of our own Institute, your       presence symbolises to us the aspiration, radiant in hope, and       prophetic in promise, which animates all true and loyal subjects of       Her Majesty, and which is alone worthy of our past history, and       present responsibilities--the aspirations of a strong and united       people for a vigorous, and progressive '"]]]
