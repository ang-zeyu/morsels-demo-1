These latter are timid,  unless accompanied by a calf, and are rarely known to turn upon their  pursuers. But the white are fierce at all times; they will not, indeed,  attack man, but will scarcely run from him, and it is not always safe to  cross their haunts.    The bulls are savage beyond measure at certain seasons of the year. If  they see men at a distance, they retire; if they come unexpectedly face  to face, they attack. This characteristic enables those who travel  through districts known to be haunted by white cattle to provide against  an encounter, for, by occasionally blowing a horn, the herd that may be  in the vicinity is dispersed. There are not often more than twenty in a  herd. The hides of the dun are highly prized, both for their intrinsic  value, and as proofs of skill and courage, so much so that you shall  hardly buy a skin for all the money you may offer; and the horns are  likewise trophies. The white or dun bull is the monarch of our forests.    Four kinds of wild pigs are found. The most numerous, or at least the  most often seen, as it lies about our enclosures, is the common  thorn-hog. It is the largest of the wild pigs, long-bodied and  flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows. To  the agriculturist it is the greatest pest, destroying or damaging all  kinds of crops, and routing up the gardens. It is with difficulty kept  out by palisading, for if there be a weak place in the wooden framework,  the strong snout of the animal is sure to undermine and work a passage  through.    As there are always so many of these pigs round about inhabited places  and cultivated fields, constant care is required, for they instantly  discover an opening. From their habit of haunting the thickets and bush  which come up to the verge of the enclosures, they have obtained the  name of thorn-hogs. Some reach an immense size, and they are very  prolific, so that it is impossible to destroy them. The boars are fierce  at a particular season, but never attack unless provoked to do so. But  when driven to bay they are the most dangerous of the boars, on account  of their vast size and weight. They are of a sluggish disposition, and  will not rise from their lairs unless forced to do so.    The next kind is the white hog, which has much the same habits as the  former, except that it is usually found in moist places, near lakes and  rivers, and is often called the marsh-pig. The third kind is perfectly  black, much smaller in size, and very active, affording by far the best  sport, and also the best food when killed. As they are found on the  hills where the ground is somewhat more open, horses can follow freely,  and the chase becomes exciting. By some it is called the hill-hog, from  the locality it frequents. The small tusks of the black boar are used  for many ornamental purposes.    These three species are considered to be the descendants of the various  domestic pigs of the ancients, but the fourth, or grey, is thought to be  the true wild boar. It is seldom seen, but is most common in the  south-western forests, where, from the quantity of fern, it is called  the fern-pig. This kind is believed to represent the true wild boar,  which was extinct, or merged in the domestic hog among the ancients,  except in that neighbourhood where the strain remained.    With wild times, the wild habits have returned, and the grey boar is at  once the most difficult of access, and the most ready to encounter  either dogs or men. Although the first, or thorn-hog, does the most  damage to the agriculturist because of its numbers, and its habit of  haunting the neighbourhood of enclosures, the others are equally  injurious if they chance to enter the cultivated fields.    The three principal kinds of wild sheep are the horned, the thyme, and  the meadow. The thyme sheep are the smallest, and haunt the highest  hills in the south, where, feeding on the sweet herbage of the ridges,  their flesh is said to acquire a flavour of wild thyme. They move in  small flocks of not more than thirty, and are the most difficult to  approach, being far more wary than deer, so continuously are they hunted  by the wood-dogs. The horned are larger, and move in greater numbers; as  many as two hundred are sometimes seen together.    They are found on the lower slopes and plains, and in the woods. The  meadow sheep have long shaggy wool, which is made into various articles  of clothing, but they are not numerous. They haunt river sides, and the  shores of lakes and ponds. None of these are easily got at, on account  of the wood-dogs; but the rams of the horned kind are reputed to  sometimes turn upon the pursuing pack, and butt them to death. In the  extremity of their terror whole flocks of wild sheep have been driven  over precipices and into quagmires and torrents.    Besides these, there are several other species whose haunt is local. On  the islands, especially, different kinds are found. The wood-dogs will  occasionally, in calm weather, swim out to an island and kill every  sheep upon it.    From the horses that were in use among the ancients the two wild species  now found are known to have descended, a fact confirmed by their evident  resemblance to the horses we still retain. The largest wild horse is  almost black, or inclined to a dark colour, somewhat less in size than  our present waggon horses, but of the same heavy make. It is, however,  much swifter, on account of having enjoyed liberty for so long. It is  called the bush-horse, being generally distributed among thickets and  meadow-like lands adjoining water.    The other species is called the hill-pony, from its habitat, the hills,  and is rather less in size than our riding-horse. This latter is short  and thick-set, so much so as not to be easily ridden by short persons  without high stirrups. Neither of these wild horses are numerous, but  neither are they uncommon. They keep entirely separate from each other.  As many as thirty mares are sometimes seen together, but there are  districts where the traveller will not observe one for weeks.    Tradition says that in the olden times there were horses of a slender  build whose speed outstripped the wind, but of the breed of these famous  racers not one is left. Whether they were too delicate to withstand  exposure, or whether the wild dogs hunted them down is uncertain, but  they are quite gone. Did but one exist, how eagerly it would be sought  out, for in these days it would be worth its weight in gold, unless,  indeed, as some affirm, such speed only endured for a mile or two.    It is not necessary, having written thus far of the animals, that  anything be said of the birds of the woods, which every one knows were  not always wild, and which can, indeed, be compared with such poultry as  are kept in our enclosures. Such are the bush-hens, the wood-turkeys,  the galenae, the peacocks, the white duck and the white goose, all of  which, though now wild as the hawk, are well known to have been once  tame.    There were deer, red and fallow, in numerous parks and chases of very  old time, and these, having got loose, and having such immense tracts to  roam over unmolested, went on increasing till now they are beyond  computation, and I have myself seen a thousand head together. Within  these forty years, as I learn, the roe-deer, too, have come down from  the extreme north, so that there are now three sorts in the woods.  Before them the pine-marten came from the same direction, and, though  they are not yet common, it is believed they are increasing. For the  first few years after the change took place there seemed a danger lest  the foreign wild beasts that had been confined as curiosities in  menageries should multiply and remain in the woods. But this did not  happen.    Some few lions, tigers, bears, and other animals did indeed escape,  together with many less furious creatures, and it is related that they  roamed about the fields for a long time. They were seldom met with,  having such an extent of country to wander over, and after a while  entirely disappeared. If any progeny were born, the winter frosts must  have destroyed it, and the same fate awaited the monstrous serpents  which had been collected for exhibition. Only one such animal now exists  which is known to owe its origin to those which escaped from the dens of  the ancients. It is the beaver, whose dams are now occasionally found  upon the streams by those who traverse the woods. Some of the aquatic  birds, too, which frequent the lakes, are thought to have been  originally derived from those which were formerly kept as curiosities.    In the castle yard at Longtover may still be seen the bones of an  elephant which was found dying in the woods near that spot.          CHAPTER III    MEN OF THE WOODS      So far as this, all that I have stated has been clear, and there can be  no doubt that what has been thus handed down from mouth to mouth is for  the most part correct. When I pass from trees and animals to men,  however, the thing is different, for nothing is certain and everything  confused. None of the accounts agree, nor can they be altogether  reconciled with present facts or with reasonable supposition; yet it is  not so long since but a few memories, added one to the other, can bridge  the time, and, though not many, there are some written notes still to be  found. I must attribute the discrepancy to the wars and hatreds which  sprang up and divided the people, so that one would not listen to what  the others wished to say, and the truth was lost.    Besides which, in the conflagration which consumed the towns, most of  the records were destroyed, and are no longer to be referred to. And it  may be that even when they were proceeding, the causes of the change  were not understood. Therefore, what I am now about to describe is not  to be regarded as the ultimate truth, but as the nearest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13962"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 455, September 20, 1884 (#3)"],[1,"of these methods before describing the one that was,  and probably is still, in use; and I will afterward describe a method  which I invented, and which is practically superior to any other, both in  the rapidity with which the color can be formed, and for producing it at a  less cost.    It is stated in Watts' \"Dictionary of Chemistry\" that it is \"prepared on a  large scale by mixing arsenious acid with cupric acetate and water. Five  parts of verdigris are made up to a thin paste, and added to a boiling  solution of 4 parts or rather more of arsenious acid in 50 parts of water.  The boiling must be well kept up, otherwise the precipitate assumes a  yellow-green color, from the formation of copper arsenite; in that case  acetic acid must be added, and the boiling continued a few minutes longer.  The precipitate then becomes crystalline, and acquires the fine green  color peculiar to the aceto-arsenite.\" I do not know from personal  knowledge, but I have always understood that the copper salt employed in  its manufacture in France is the acetate. This would account, in my  opinion, for the larger crystalline flakes in which it is obtained in  France than can be produced by the English method of manufacturing it.  Cupric acetate is never employed, I believe, in England--the much cheaper  copper salt, the sulphate, being always employed.    In \"Miller's Chemistry\" it is stated it \"may be obtained by _boiling_  solutions of arsenious anhydride and cupric acetate, and adding to the  mixture an equal bulk of _cold_ water.\" Why it should be recommended to  add _cold water_, I am at a loss to understand.    In Drs. Roscoe and Schorlemmer's large work on \"Chemistry,\" and in the  English edition of \"Wagner's Handbook of Chemical Technology,\" edited by  Mr. Crookes, the process as described by Dr. Ehrmann in the \"Ann. Pharm.,\"  xii., 92, is given. It is thus stated in Wagner's work: \"This pigment is  prepared by first separately dissolving equal parts by weight of arsenious  acid and neutral acetate of copper in boiling water, and next mixing these  solutions while boiling. There is immediately formed a flocculent  olive-green colored precipitate of arsenite of copper, while the  supernatant liquid contains free acetic acid. After a while the  precipitate becomes gradually crystalline, at the same time forming a  beautiful green pigment, which is separated from the liquid by filtration,  and after washing and carefully drying is ready for use. The mode of  preparing this pigment on a large scale was originally devised by M.  Braconnot, as follows: 15 kilos. of sulphate of copper are dissolved in  the smallest quantity of boiling water, and mixed with a boiling and  concentrated solution of arsenite of soda or potassa, so prepared as to  contain 20 kilos. of arsenious acid. There is immediately formed a dirty  greenish-colored precipitate which is converted into Schweinfurt green by  the addition of some 15 liters of concentrated wood-vinegar. This having  been done, the precipitate is immediately filtered off and washed.\"    As I have already stated, the copper salt used in the manufacture of this  pigment in England is the sulphate, and it is carried out pretty much  according to Braconnot's method as described by Dr Ehrmann; but any one  would infer, from reading his description of the manufacturing process,  that the compound, aceto-arsenite of copper, was formed almost immediately  after the addition of the acetic acid, a higher or lower atmospheric  temperature having no effect in hastening or retarding the formation.  Furthermore, it is not stated whether the compound forms more readily in  an acid or neutral solution, or whether it can or cannot be formed in a  neutral one; now both these points are important to notice in describing  its manufacture. As regards the former I shall notice it presently, and,  as far as my knowledge extends, the pigment will not form when the  solution is neutral.    The operation is conducted in the following manner in the factory: The  requisite quantity of sulphate of copper is placed in a large wooden vat,  and hot water added to dissolve it; the requisite quantity of arsenic  (arsenious anhydride) and carbonate of soda, the latter not in quantity  quite sufficient to neutralize the whole of the sulphuric acid set free  from the sulphate of copper on the precipitation of the copper as  arsenite, are placed in another wooden vessel; water is then added, and  the formation of the arsenite of soda and its solution are aided by the  introduction of steam into the liquid. When complete solution has been  effected the arsenic solution is run off into the vat containing the  solution of the sulphate of copper, arsenite of copper being at once  precipitated. The necessary quantity of acetic acid is afterward added. In  _warm_ weather the formation of the aceto-arsenite soon commences after  the addition of the vinegar; but, even in that case, it takes a week or  more to have the whole of a big batch of arsenite converted into the  aceto-arsenite; and perfect conversion is necessary, as the presence of a  very minute quantity of unchanged arsenite lowers very much the price of  the emerald pigment, and a by no means large quantity renders the pigment  unsalable, owing to its dirty yellowish-green color. In cold weather a  much longer time is required for its complete conversion; even at the end  of a fortnight or three weeks there frequently remains sufficient  unconverted arsenite to affect seriously the selling price of the color;  when this occurs the manufacturer generally removes these last traces by a  most wasteful method viz, by adding a quantity of free sulphuric acid. The  acid of course dissolves the arsenite, but it dissolves in very much  larger quantities the aceto-arsenite; and this costly solution is not  utilized, but is run into the factory sewer.    By my method of manufacturing it, it can be produced in winter as well as  in summer in one or two hours, and the quantity of free acid required for  its formation is reduced to the lowest amount. I proceed as follows: After  having dissolved in hot water the requisite quantity of cupric sulphate, I  decompose one-fourth of this salt by adding just sufficient of a solution  of carbonate of soda to precipitate the copper, in that quantity of the  sulphate, as carbonate. I then add just sufficient acetic acid to convert  the carbonate into acetate. I have now got in solution--        3CuSO_{4} + Cu(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2},    and I have to transform it into--        3CuAs_{2}O_{4} + Cu(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}.    It is at once seen that I have got the requisite quantity of acetate  formed. I next dissolve the requisite quantity of arsenious anhydride in  an amount of carbonate of soda _rather less_ than is sufficient to  neutralize the acid in the remaining cupric sulphate, and I then bring the  solution to or near the boiling-point by introducing steam into it; the  arsenic is dissolved not in the same vessel as the copper salt, but in a  separate one. When the arsenic solution is fully heated, a small current  of it is allowed to flow into the vat containing the copper salts, and  brisk stirring is kept up in the vat. The emerald green is at once formed;  but if there should be the slightest formation of any arsenite, the flow  of the arsenic solution is at once stopped until every trace of the  arsenite has been converted; the arsenic solution is then allowed to flow  in again, with the same precautions as before; in this way a large batch  of emerald-green can he formed in one or two hours, without containing the  slightest trace of the arsenite. I keep the arsenic solution near the  boiling-point during the whole of the time it is flowing into the other  vessel. By varying the proportions of water I could either make it coarse  or fine, as I wished, which is an important matter to have complete  control over in its manufacture.    Two points of interest occurred to me during the time I was occupied with  the research, which I had not time to complete; one was whether the  aceto-arsenite can be formed, adopting the old method for its formation,  if there is more than a certain quantity of water; from some experiments I  made in this direction I was inclined to the opinion it could not. I have  already stated that emerald-green is soluble to a certain extent in acids,  and that it is formed in a more or less acid solution; consequently a  varying amount of the pigment is always lost by being dissolved in the  supernatant liquid. To prevent to a certain extent this loss I  precipitated the copper from it as arsenite; but I was not successful in  the few experiments I had time to make on this part of the subject of  reconverting the copper arsenite thus obtained into the aceto-arsenite by  the addition of acetic acid.--_Jour. of Science._           *       *       *       *       *          ANALYSIS OF ZINC ASH AND CALCINED PYRITES BY MEANS OF AMMONIUM CARBONATE.      In a recent issue of the _Chemiker Zeitung_ Dr. Kosmann has reported an  analytical method for the examination of zinciferous products; according  to this report, the ash and flue dust produced by the extraction of zinc  from its ore comprise:    1. Zinc dust, from the distillation of zinc,    2. Flue dust, condensed in chambers of zinc furnaces with Kleemann's  receivers,    3. Zinc ash, of various assortments, from iron blast furnaces.    Of these, zinc dust is the only ready product which is, as color or  reducing agent, employed in analytical and technical processes. Its value,  when serving the latter purpose, is determined by the percentage of finely  divided metallic zinc and cadmium contained therein; of equal reducing  power is cadmium, generally associating zinc; injurious, and therefore  uneffective, are zinc oxide and oxides of other metals, also metallic  lead.
