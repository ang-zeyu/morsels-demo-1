Why didn't we think of him before?\" exclaimed the others.    \"I'll beat you to the Smiling Pool!\" shouted Peter.    Of course he did, for his legs are long and made for running, but  Striped Chipmunk was not far behind. Johnny Chuck took his time, for  he knew that he could not keep up with the others. Besides he was so  fat that to run made him puff and blow. Grandfather Frog sat just as  usual on his big green lily-pad, and he grinned when he saw who his  visitors were, for he guessed right away what they had come for.    \"Chug-a-rum! What is it you want to know now?\" he demanded, before  Peter could fairly get his breath.    \"If you please, Grandfather Frog, we want to know why it is that Unc'  Billy Possum plays dead,\" replied Peter as politely as he knew how.    Grandfather Frog chuckled. \"Just to fool people, stupid!\" said he.    \"Of course we know that,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, \"but what we want  to know is how he ever found out that he could fool people that way,  and how he knows that he will fool them.\"    \"I suspect that his mammy taught him,\" said Grandfather Frog, with  another chuckle way down deep in his throat.    \"But who taught his mammy?\" persisted Striped Chipmunk.    Grandfather Frog snapped at a foolish green fly, and when it was  safely tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat, he turned  once more to his three little visitors, and there was a twinkle in his  big, goggly eyes.    \"I see,\" said he, \"that you _will_ have a story, and I suppose that  the sooner I tell it to you, the sooner you will leave me in peace.  Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand times removed was--\"    \"Was this way back in the days when the world was young?\" interrupted  Peter.    Grandfather Frog scowled at Peter. \"If I have any more interruptions,  there will be no story to-day\" said he severely.    Peter looked ashamed and promised that he would hold his tongue right  between his teeth until Grandfather Frog was through. Grandfather Frog  cleared his throat and began again.    \"Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand times removed was very  much as Unc' Billy is now, only he was a little more spry and knew  better than to stuff himself so full that he couldn't run. He was  always very sly, and he played a great many tricks on his neighbors,  and sometimes he got them into trouble. But when he did, he always  managed to keep out of their way until they had forgotten all about  their anger.    \"One morning the very imp of mischief seemed to get into old Mr.  Possum's head. Yes, Sir, it certainly did seem that way. And when you  see Mischief trotting along the Lone Little Path, if you look sharp  enough, you'll see Trouble following at his heels like a shadow. I  never knew it to fail. It's just as sure as a stomach-ache is to  follow overeating.\"    Just here Grandfather Frog paused and looked very hard at Peter  Rabbit. But Peter pretended not to notice, and after slowly winking  one of his big, goggly eyes at Johnny Chuck, Grandfather Frog  continued:    \"Anyway, as I said before, the imp of mischief seemed to be in old Mr.  Possum's head that morning, for he began to play tricks on his  neighbors as soon as they were out of bed. He hid Old King Bear's  breakfast, while the latter had his head turned, and then pretended  that he had just come along. He was very polite and offered to help  Old King Bear hunt for his lost breakfast. Then, whenever Old King  Bear came near the place where it was hidden, old Mr. Possum would  hide it somewhere else. Old King Bear was hungry, and he worked  himself up into a terrible rage, for he was in a hurry for his  breakfast. Old Mr. Possum was very sympathetic and seemed to be doing  his very best to find the lost meal. At last Old King Bear turned his  head suddenly and caught sight of old Mr. Possum hiding that  breakfast in a new place. My, my, but his temper did boil over! It  certainly did. And if he could have laid hands on old Mr. Possum that  minute, it surely would have been the end of him.    \"But old Mr. Possum was mighty spry, and he went off through the Green  Forest laughing fit to kill himself. Pretty soon he met Mr. Panther.  He was very polite to Mr. Panther. He told him that he had just come  from a call on Old King Bear, and hinted that Old King Bear was then  enjoying a feast and that there might be enough for Mr. Panther, if he  hurried up there at once.    \"Now, Mr. Panther was hungry, for he had found nothing for his  breakfast that morning. So he thanked old Mr. Possum and hurried away  to find Old King Bear and share in the good things old Mr. Possum had  told about.    \"Old Mr. Possum himself hurried on, chuckling as he thought of the way  Mr. Panther was likely to be received, with Old King Bear in such a  temper. Pretty soon along came Mr. Lynx. Old Mr. Possum told him the  same story he had told Mr. Panther, and Mr. Lynx went bounding off in  a terrible hurry, for fear that he would not be in time to share in  that good breakfast. It was such a good joke that old Mr. Possum tried  it on Mr. Wolf and Mr. Fisher and Mr. Fox. In fact, he hunted up every  one he could think of and sent them to call on Old King Bear, and  without really telling them so, he made each one think that he would  get a share in that breakfast.\"    \"Now, there wasn't any more breakfast than Old King Bear wanted  himself, and by the time Mr. Panther arrived, there wasn't so much as  a crumb left. Then, one after another, the others came dropping in,  each licking his chops, and all very polite to Old King Bear. At first  he didn't know what to make of it, but pretty soon Mr. Fox delicately  hinted that they had come in response to the invitation sent by Mr.  Possum, and that as they were all very hungry, they would like to know  when the feast would be ready. Right away Old King Bear knew that old  Mr. Possum had been up to some of his tricks, and he told his visitors  that they were the victims of a practical joke.    [Illustration: \"As they were all very hungry, they would like to know  when the feast would be ready.\"]    \"My, my, my, how angry everybody grew! With Old King Bear at their  head, they started out to hunt for old Mr. Possum. When he saw them  coming, he realized that what he had thought was a joke had become no  longer a laughing matter for him. He was too frightened to run, so  he scrambled up a tree. He quite forgot that Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx  could climb just as fast as he. Up the tree after him they scrambled,  and he crept as far out as he could get on one of the branches. Mr.  Panther didn't dare go out there, so he just shook the branch. He  shook and shook and shook and shook, and the first thing old Mr.  Possum knew, he was flying through the air down to where the others  were all ready to pounce on him.    \"Old Mr. Possum was frightened almost to death. He shut his eyes, and  then he landed with a thump that knocked all the wind from his body.  When he got his breath again, he still kept his eyes closed, for he  couldn't bear the thought of looking at the cruel teeth and claws of  Old King Bear and the others. Presently, while he was wondering why  they didn't jump on him and tear him to pieces, Old King Bear spoke:    \"'I guess Mr. Possum won't play any more jokes, Mr. Panther,' said he.  'You just knocked the life out of him when you shook him off that  branch.'    \"Mr. Panther came over and sniffed at Mr. Possum and turned him over  with one paw. All the time Mr. Possum lay just as if he were dead,  because he was too frightened to move. 'I didn't mean to kill him,'  said Mr. Panther. 'We certainly will miss him. What will we do with  him?'    \"'Leave him here as a warning to others,' growled Old King Bear.    \"Each in turn came up and sniffed of Mr. Possum, and then they all  went about their business. He waited long enough to make sure that  they were out of sight, and then took the shortest way home. When he  got there and thought it all over, he thought that the best joke of  all was the way he had made everybody think that he was dead. And then  a bright idea struck him: he would try the same trick whenever he was  caught. So the next time he got in trouble, instead of running away,  he tried playing dead. It was such a success that he taught his  children how to do it, and they taught their children, and so on down  to Unc' Billy, whom you know. Unc' Billy says it is a lot easier than  running away, and safer, too. Besides, it is always such a joke. Now,  don't bother me any more, for I want to take a nap,\" concluded  Grandfather Frog.    \"Thank you!\" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk,  and started off to hunt up Unc' Billy Possum.          IV    WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED      Peter Rabbit sat in the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch making  faces and laughing at Reddy Fox. Of course that wasn't a nice thing to  do, not a bit nice. But Peter had just had a narrow escape, a very  narrow escape, for Reddy Fox had sprung out from behind a bush as  Peter came down the Lone Little Path, and had so nearly caught Peter  that he had actually pulled some fur out of Peter's coat. Now Peter  was safe in the dear Old Briar-patch. He was a little out of breath,  because he had had to use his long legs as fast as he knew how, but he  was safe. You see, Reddy Fox wouldn't run the risk of tearing his  handsome red coat on the brambles. Besides, they scratched terribly.    \"Never mind, Peter Rabbit, I'll get you yet!\" snarled Reddy, as he  gave up and started back for the Green Forest.        \"Reddy Fox is very sly!

HYMN BEFORE MEAT        Blest Cross-bearer, Source of good,      Light-creating, Word-begot,    Gracious child of maidenhood,      Bosomed in the Fatherhood,    When earth, sea and stars were not.      With Thy cloudless, healing gaze      Shine upon me from above:    Let Thine all-enlightening rays      Bless this meal and quicken praise,    Praise unto Thy name of Love.      Lord, without Thee nought is sweet,      Nought my life can satisfy,    If Thy favour make not meet      What I drink and what I eat;    Let faith all things sanctify!      O'er this bread God's grace be poured,      Christ's sweet fragrance fill the bowl!    Rule my converse, Triune Lord,      Sober thought and sportive word,    All my acts and all my soul.      Spoils of rose-trees are not spent,      Nor rich unguents on my board:    But ambrosial sweets are sent,      Of faith's nectar redolent,    From the bosom of my Lord.      Scorn, my Muse, light ivy-leaves      Wherewith custom wreathed thy brow:    Love a mystic crown conceives      And a rhythmic garland weaves:    Bind on thee God's praises now.      What more worthy gift can I,      Child of light and aether, bring    Than for boons the Maker high      From His bounty doth supply    Lovingly my thanks to sing?      He hath set 'neath our command      All that ever rose to be,    All that sky and sea and land      Breed in air, in glebe and sand,    Made my slaves, His own made me.      Fowler's craft with gin and net      Feathered tribes of heaven ensnares:    Osier twigs with lime o'erset      That their airy flight may let    His relentless guile prepares.      Lo! with woven mesh the seine      Swimming shoals draws from the wave:    Nor do fish the bait disdain      Till they feel the barb's swift pain,    Captives of the food they crave.      Native wealth that knows no fail,      Golden wheat springs from the field:    Tendrils lush o'er vineyards trail,      Nursed of Peace the olives pale    Berries green unbidden yield.      Christ's grace fills His people's need      With these mercies ever fresh:    Far from us be that foul greed,      Gluttony that loves to feed    On slain oxen's bloodstained flesh.      Leave to the barbarian brood      Banquet of the slaughtered beast:    Ours the homely, garden food,      Greenstuff manifold and good    And the lentils' harmless feast.      Foaming milkpails bubble o'er      With the udders' snowy stream,    Which in thickening churns we pour      Or in wicker baskets store,    As the cheese is pressed from cream.      Honey's nectar for our use      From the new-made comb is shed:    Which the skilful bee imbues      With thyme's scent and airy dews,    Plying lonely toils unwed.      Orchard-groves now mellowed o'er      Bounteously their fruitage shed:    See! like rain on forest floor      Shaken trees their riches pour,    High-heaped apples, ripe and red.      What great trumpet voice or lyre      Famed of yore could fitly praise    Gifts of the Almighty Sire,  "]]]
