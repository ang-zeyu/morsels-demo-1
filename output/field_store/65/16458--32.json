I will take them as  nearly as possible in the order in which they stand, grouping them,  however, for further convenience sake under their various sectarian  heads, for it must be remembered that Islam, which in its institution  was intended to be one community, political and religious, is now  divided not only into many nations, but into many sects. All, however,  hold certain fundamental beliefs, and all perform the pilgrimage to  Mecca, where they meet on common ground, and it is to this latter fact  that the importance attached to the Haj is mainly owing.    The main beliefs common to all Mussulmans are--    1. A belief in one true God, the creator and ordainer of all things.    2. A belief in a future life of reward or punishment.    3. A belief in a divine revelation imparted first to Adam and renewed at  intervals to Noah, to Abraham, to Moses, and to Jesus Christ, and last  of all in its perfect form to Mohammed. This revelation is not only one  of dogma, but of practice. It claims to have taught an universal rule  of life for all mankind in politics and legislation as well as in  doctrine and in morals. This is called Islam.    4. A belief in the Koran as the literal word of God, and of its inspired  interpretation by the Prophet and his companions, preserved through  tradition (Hadith).[1]    These summed up in the well-known \"Kelemat\" or act of faith, \"There is  no God but God, and Mohammed is the apostle of God,\" form a common  doctrinal basis for every sect of Islam--and also common to all are the  four religious acts, prayer, fasting, almsgiving and pilgrimage,  ordained by the Koran itself. On other points, however, both of belief  and practice, they differ widely; so widely that the sects must be  considered as not only distinct from, but hostile to, each other. They  are nevertheless, it must be admitted, less absolutely irreconcileable  than are the corresponding sects of Christianity, for all allow the rest  to be distinctly within the pale of Islam, and they pray on occasion in  each other's mosques and kneel at the same shrines on pilgrimage.  Neither do they condemn each other's errors as altogether  damnable--except, I believe, in the case of the Wahhabites, who accuse  other Moslems of polytheism and idolatry. The census of the four great  sects may be thus roughly given--         1.  The Sunites or Orthodox Mohammedans    145,000,000       2.  The Shiites or Sect of Ali              15,000,000       3.  The Abadites (Abadhiyeh)                 7,000,000       4.  The Wahhabites                           8,000,000    The _Sunites_, or People of the Path, are of course by far the most  important of these. They stand in that relation to the other sects in  which the Catholic Church stands to the various Christian heresies, and  claim alone to represent that continuous body of tradition political and  religious, which is the sign of a living church. In addition to the  dogmas already mentioned, they hold that, after the Prophet and his  companions, other authorised channels of tradition exist of hardly less  authority with these. The sayings of the four first Caliphs, as  collected in the first century of the Mohammedan era, they hold to be  inspired and unimpeachable, as are to a certain extent the theological  treatises of the four great doctors of Islam, the Imams Abu Hanifeh,  Malek, Esh Shafy, and Hanbal, and after them, though with less and less  authority, the \"fetwas,\" or decisions of distinguished Ulema, down to  the present day. The collected body of teaching acquired from these  sources is called the Sheriat (in Turkey the Sheriati Sherifeh) and is  the canon law of Islam. Nor is it lawful that this should be gainsaid;  while the Imams themselves may not inaptly be compared to the fathers of  our Christian Church. It is a dogma, too, with the Sunites that they are  not only an ecclesiastical but a political body, and that among them is  the living representative of the temporal power of the Prophet, in the  person of his Khalifeh or successor, though there is much division of  opinion as to the precise line of succession in the past and the  legitimate ownership of the title in the present. But this is too  intricate and important a matter to be entered on at present.    The Sunites are then the body of authority and tradition, and being more  numerous than the other three sects put together in a proportion of four  and a half to one, have a good right to treat these as heretics. It must  not, however, be supposed that even the Sunites profess absolutely  homogeneous opinions. The path of Orthodox Islam is no macadamised road  such as the Catholic Church of Christendom has become, but like one of  its own Haj routes goes winding on, a labyrinth of separate tracks, some  near, some far apart, some clean out of sight of the rest. All lead, it  is true, in the same main direction, and here and there in difficult  ground where there is a mountain range to cross or where some defile  narrows they are brought together, but otherwise they follow their own  ways as the idiosyncrasy of race and disposition may dictate. There is  no common authority in the world acknowledged as superior to the rest,  neither is there any office corresponding even remotely with the  infallible Papacy.    The Mohammedan nations have for the most part each its separate school,  composed of its own Ulema and presided over by its own Grand Mufti or  Sheykh el Islam, and these are independent of all external influence. If  they meet at all it is at Mecca, but even at Mecca there is no college  of cardinals, no central authority; and though occasionally cases are  referred thither or to Constantinople or Cairo, the fetwas given are not  of absolute binding power over the faithful in other lands. Moreover,  besides these national distinctions, there are three recognized schools  of theology which divide between them the allegiance of the orthodox,  and which, while not in theory opposed, do in fact represent as many  distinct lines of religious thought. These it has been the fashion with  European writers to describe as sects, but the name sect is certainly  inaccurate, for the distinctions recognisable in their respective  teachings are not more clearly marked than in those of our own Church  parties, the high, the low, and the broad. Indeed a rather striking  analogy may be traced between these three phases of English church  teaching and the three so-called \"orthodox sects\" of Islam. The three  Mohammedan schools are the Hanefite, the Malekite, and the Shafite,  while a fourth, the Hanbalite, is usually added, but it numbers at the  present day so few followers that we need not notice it.[2] A few words  will describe each of these.    The _Hanefite_ school of theology may be described as the school of the  upper classes. It is the high and dry party of Church and State, if such  expressions can be used about Islam. To it belongs the Osmanli race, I  believe without exception, the ruling race of the north, and their  kinsmen who founded Empires in Central and Southern Asia. The official  classes, too, in most parts of the world are Hanefite, including the  Viceregal courts of Egypt, Tripoli, and Tunis, and it would seem the  courts of most of the Indian princes. It is probably rather as a  consequence of this than as its reason that it is the most conservative  of schools, conservative in the true sense of leaving things exactly as  they are. The Turkish Ulema have always insisted strongly on the dogma  that the _ijtahad_, that is to say the elaboration of new doctrine, is  absolutely closed; that nothing can be added to or taken away from the  already existing body of religious law, and that no new _mujtahed_, or  doctor of Islam, can be expected who shall adapt that law to the life of  the modern world. At the same time, while obstinate in matters of  opinion, Hanefism has become extremely lax as to practice. Its moral  teaching is held, and I believe justly, to be adapted only too closely  to the taste of its chief supporters. It is accused by its enemies of  having given the sanction of its toleration to the moral"]]]
