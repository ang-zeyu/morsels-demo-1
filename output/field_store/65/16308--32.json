The opinion of such a man  ought to carry weight when native affairs are being discussed.  We have fallen into the habit of discussing and legislating  for the Native without ever stopping for one moment to consider  what the Native himself thinks.  No one but a fool will deny  the importance of knowing what the Native thinks before we legislate for him.  It is in the hope of enlightening an otherwise barren controversy  that we shall publish from time to time Mr. Plaatje's letters,  commending them always to the more thoughtful and practical of our readers.  -- `Pretoria News', September, 1910.  ==    (The writer of this appreciation, the Editor of the Pretoria evening paper,  was Reuter's war correspondent in the siege of Mafeking.)                  (B)     Prologue        We have often read books, written by well-known scholars,  who disavow, on behalf of their works, any claim to literary perfection.  How much more necessary, then, that a South African native workingman,  who has never received any secondary training, should in attempting authorship  disclaim, on behalf of his work, any title to literary merit.  Mine is but a sincere narrative of a melancholy situation,  in which, with all its shortcomings, I have endeavoured to describe  the difficulties of the South African Natives under a very strange law,  so as most readily to be understood by the sympathetic reader.    The information contained in the following chapters is the result  of personal observations made by the author in certain districts of  the Transvaal, Orange \"Free\" State and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope.  In pursuance of this private inquiry, I reached Lady Brand  early in September, 1913, when, my financial resources being exhausted,  I decided to drop the inquiry and return home.  But my friend,  Mr. W. Z. Fenyang, of the farm Rietfontein, in the \"Free\" State,  offered to convey me to the South of Moroka district,  where I saw much of the trouble, and further, he paid my railway fare  from Thaba Ncho back to Kimberley.    In the following November, it was felt that as Mr. Saul Msane,  the organizer for the South African Native National Congress,  was touring the eastern districts of the Transvaal,  and Mr. Dube, the President, was touring the northern districts and Natal,  and as the finances of the Congress did not permit an additional traveller,  no information would be forthcoming in regard to the operation  of the mischievous Act in the Cape Province.  So Mr. J. M. Nyokong,  of the farm Maseru, offered to bear part of the expenses if I would undertake  a visit to the Cape.  I must add that beyond spending six weeks  on the tour to the Cape, the visit did not cost me much,  for Mr. W. D. Soga, of King Williamstown, very generously  supplemented Mr. Nyokong's offer and accompanied me on a part of the journey.    Besides the information received and the hospitality enjoyed  from these and other friends, the author is indebted, for further information,  to Mr. Attorney Msimang, of Johannesburg.  Mr. Msimang toured  some of the Districts, compiled a list of some of the sufferers  from the Natives' Land Act, and learnt the circumstances of their eviction.  His list, however, is not full, its compilation having been undertaken  in May, 1914, when the main exodus of the evicted tenants  to the cities and Protectorates had already taken place,  and when eyewitnesses of the evils of the Act had already fled the country.  But it is useful in showing that the persecution is still continuing,  for, according to this list, a good many families were evicted  a year after the Act was enforced, and many more were at that time  under notice to quit.  Mr. Msimang, modestly states in an explanatory note,  that his pamphlet contains \"comparatively few instances  of actual cases of hardship under the Natives' Land Act, 1913,  to vindicate the leaders of the South African Native National Congress  from the gross imputation, by the Native Affairs Department,  that they make general allegations of hardships without producing  any specific cases that can bear examination.\"  Mr. Msimang,  who took a number of sworn statements from the sufferers,  adds that \"in Natal, for example, all of these instances  have been reported to the Magistrates and the Chief Native Commissioner.  Every time they are told to find themselves other places,  or remain where they are under labour conditions.  At Peters and Colworth,  seventy-nine and a hundred families respectively are being ejected  by the Government itself without providing land for them.\"    Some readers may perhaps think that I have taken the Colonial Parliament  rather severely to task.  But to any reader who holds  with Bacon, that \"the pencil hath laboured more in describing  the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon,\" I would say:  \"Do, if we dare make the request, and place yourself in our shoes.\"  If, after a proper declaration of war, you found your kinsmen  driven from pillar to post in the manner that the South African Natives  have been harried and scurried by Act No. 27 of 1913, you would,  though aware that it is part of the fortunes of war, find it difficult  to suppress your hatred of the enemy.  Similarly, if you see  your countrymen and countrywomen driven from home, their homes broken up,  with no hopes of redress, on the mandate of a Government  to which they had loyally paid taxation without representation --  driven from their homes, because they do not want to become servants;  and when you know that half of these homeless ones have perforce  submitted to the conditions and accepted service on terms  that are unprofitable to themselves; if you remember  that more would have submitted but for the fact that no master has any use  for a servant with forty head of cattle, or a hundred or more sheep;  and if you further bear in mind that many landowners are anxious  to live at peace with, and to keep your people as tenants,  but that they are debarred from doing so by your Government  which threatens them with a fine of 100 Pounds or six months' imprisonment,  you would, I think, likewise find it very difficult to maintain a level head  or wield a temperate pen.    For instance, let us say, the London County Council decrees  that no man shall rent a room, or hire a house, in the City of London  unless he be a servant in the employ of the landlord, adding that  there shall be a fine of one hundred pounds on any one who attempts  to sell a house to a non-householder; imagine such a thing and its effects,  then you have some approach to an accurate picture of the operation  of the South African Natives' Land Act of 1913.  In conclusion,  let me ask the reader's support in our campaign for the repeal of such a law,  and in making this request I pray that none of my readers may live  to find themselves in a position so intolerable.    When the narrative of this book up to Chapter XVIII was completed,  it was felt that an account of life in South Africa,  without a reference to the war or the rebellion would be  but a story half told, and so Chapters XIX-XXV were added.  It will be observed that Chapters XX-XXIV, unlike the rest of the book,  are not the result of the writer's own observations.  The writer is indebted for much of the information in these five chapters  to the Native Press and some Dutch newspapers which his devoted wife  posted to him with every mail.  These papers have been  a source of useful information.  Of the Dutch newspapers  special thanks are due to `Het Westen' of Potchefstroom,  which has since March 1915 changed its name to `Het Volksblad'.  Most of the Dutch journals, especially in the northern Provinces, take up  the views of English-speaking Dutch townsmen (solicitors and Bank clerks),  and publish them as the opinion of the South African Dutch.  `Het Westen' (now `Het Volksblad'), on the other hand,  interprets the Dutch view, sound, bad or indifferent, exactly as we ourselves  have heard it expressed by Dutchmen at their own farms.    Translations of the Tipperary Chorus into some of the languages  which are spoken by the white and black inhabitants of South Africa  have been used here and there as mottoes; and as this book is a plea  in the main for help against the \"South African war of extermination\",  it is hoped that admirers of Tommy Atkins will sympathize with  the coloured sufferers, who also sing Tommy Atkins' war songs.    This appeal is not on behalf of the naked hordes of cannibals  who are represented in fantastic pictures displayed  in the shop-windows in Europe, most of them imaginary;  but it is on behalf of five million loyal British subjects who shoulder  \"the black man's burden\" every day, doing so without looking forward  to any decoration or thanks.  \"The black man's burden\" includes  the faithful performance of all the unskilled and least paying labour  in South Africa, the payment of direct taxation to the various Municipalities,  at the rate of from 1s. to 5s. per mensum per capita (to develop and beautify  the white quarters of the towns while the black quarters remain unattended)  besides taxes to the Provincial and Central Government, varying from  12s. to 3 Pounds 12s. per annum, for the maintenance of Government Schools  from which native children are excluded.  In addition to these  native duties and taxes, it is also part of \"the black man's burden\" to pay  all duties levied from the favoured race.  With the increasing difficulty  of finding openings to earn the money for paying these multifarious taxes,  the dumb pack-ox, being inarticulate in the Councils of State,  has no means of making known to its \"keeper\" that the burden  is straining its back to breaking point.    When Sir John"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#3)"],[1,"man passes man in silence here below.    An old sage says: \"I saw the fragments of a wrecked boat floating on  the sea.  Only a few meet and hold together a long time.  Then comes a  storm and drives them east and west, and here below they will never  meet again.  So it is with mankind.  Yet no one has seen the great  shipwreck.\"          THIRD MEMORY.    The clouds in the sky of childhood do not last long, and disappear  after a short, warm tear-rain.  I was shortly again at the castle, and  the Princess gave me her hand to kiss and then brought her children,  the young princes and princesses, and we played together, as if we had  known each other for years.  Those were happy days when, after  school--for I was now attending school--I could go to the castle and  play.  We had everything the heart could wish.  I found playthings  there which my mother had shown me in the shop-windows, and which were  so dear, she told me, that poor people could live a whole week on what  they cost.  When I begged the Princess' permission to take them home  and show them to my mother, she was perfectly willing.  I could turn  over and over and look for hours at a time at beautiful picture books,  which I had seen in the book stores with my father, but which were made  only for very good children.  Everything which belonged to the young  princes belonged also to me--so I thought, at least.  Furthermore, I  was not only allowed to carry away what I wished, but I often gave away  the playthings to other children.  In short, I was a young Communist,  in the full sense of the term.  I remember at one time the Princess had  a golden snake which coiled itself around her arm as if it were alive,  and she gave it to us for a plaything.  As I was going home I put the  snake on my arm and thought I would give my mother a real fright with  it.  On the way, however, I met a woman who noticed the snake and  begged me to show it to her; and then she said if she could only keep  the golden snake, she could release her husband from prison with it.  Naturally I did not stop to think for a minute, but ran away and left  the woman alone with the golden serpent-bracelet.  The next day there  was much excitement.  The poor woman was brought to the castle and the  people said she had stolen it.  Thereupon I grew very angry and  explained with holy zeal that I had given her the bracelet and that I  would not take it back again.  What further occurred I know not, but I  remember that after that time, I showed the Princess everything I took  home with me.    It was a long time before my conceptions of Meum and Tuum were fully  settled, and at a very late period they were at times confused, just as  it was a long time before I could distinguish between the blue and red  colors.  The last time I remember my friends laughing at me on this  account was when my mother gave me some money to buy apples.  She gave  me a groschen.  The apples cost only a sechser, and when I gave the  woman the groschen, she said, very sadly as it seemed to me, that she  had sold nothing the whole livelong day and could not give me back a  sechser.  She wished I would buy a groschen's worth.  Then it occurred  to me that I also had a sechser in my pocket, and thoroughly delighted  that I had solved the difficult problem, I gave it to the woman and  said: \"Now you can give me back a sechser.\"  She understood me so  little however that she gave me back the groschen and kept the sechser.    At this time, while I was making almost daily visits to the young  princes at the castle, both to play as well as to study French with  them, another image comes up in my memory.  It was the daughter of the  Princess, the Countess Marie.  The mother died shortly after the birth  of the child and the Prince subsequently married a second time.  I know  not when I saw her for the first time.  She emerges from the darkness  of memory slowly and gradually--at first like an airy shadow which  grows more and more distinct as it approaches nearer and nearer, at  last standing before my soul like the moon, which on some stormy night  throws back the cloud-veils from across its face.  She was always sick  and suffering and silent, and I never saw her except reclining upon her  couch, upon which two servants brought her into the room and carried  her out again, when she was tired.  There she lay in her flowing white  drapery, with her hands generally folded.  Her face was so pale and yet  so mild, and her eyes so deep and unfathomable, that I often stood  before her lost in thought and looked upon her and asked myself if she  was not one of the \"strange people\" also.  Many a time she placed her  hand upon my head and then it seemed to me that a thrill ran through  all my limbs and that I could not move or speak, but must forever gaze  into her deep, unfathomable eyes.  She conversed very little with us,  but watched our sports, and when at times we grew very noisy and  quarrelsome, she did not complain but held her white hands over her  brow and closed her eyes as if sleeping.  But there were days when she  said she felt better, and on such days she sat up on her couch,  conversed with us and told us curious stories.  I do not know how old  she was at that time.  She was so helpless that she seemed like a  child, and yet was so serious and silent that she could not have been  one.  When people alluded to her they involuntarily spoke gently and  softly.  They called her \"the angel,\" and I never heard anything said  of her that was not good and lovely.  Often when I saw her lying so  silent and helpless, and thought that she would never walk again in  life, that there was for her neither work nor joy, that they would  carry her here and there upon her couch until they laid her upon her  eternal bed of rest, I asked myself why she had been sent into this  world, when she could have rested so gently on the bosom of the angels  and they could have borne her through the air on their white wings, as  I had seen in some sacred pictures.  Again I felt as if I must take a  part of her burden, so that she need not carry it alone, but we with  her.  I could not tell her all this for I knew it was not proper.  I  had an indefinable feeling.  It was not a desire to embrace her.  No  one could have done that, for it would have wronged her.  It seemed to  me as if I could pray from the very bottom of my heart that she might  be released from her burden.    One warm spring day she was brought into our room.  She looked  exceedingly pale; but her eyes were deeper and brighter than ever, and  she sat upon her couch and called us to her.  \"It is my birth-day,\"  said she, \"and I was confirmed early this morning.  Now, it is  possible,\" she continued as she looked upon her father with a smile,  \"that God may soon call me to him, although I would gladly remain with  you much longer.  But if I am to leave you, I desire that you should  not wholly forget me; and, therefore, I have brought a ring for each of  you, which you must now place upon the fore-finger.  As you grow older  you can continue to change it until it fits the little finger; but you  must wear it for your lifetime.\"    With these words she took the five rings she wore upon her fingers,  which she drew off, one after the other, with a look so sad and yet so  affectionate, that I pressed my eyes closely to keep from weeping.  She  gave the first ring to her eldest brother and kissed him, the second  and third to the two princesses, and the fourth to the youngest prince,  and kissed them all as she gave them the rings.  I stood near by, and,  looking fixedly at her white hand, saw that she still had a ring upon  her finger; but she leaned back and appeared wearied.  My eyes met  hers, and as the eyes of a child speak so loudly, she must have easily  known my thoughts, I would rather not have had the last ring, for I  felt that I was a stranger; that I did not belong to her, and that she  was not as affectionate to me as to her brothers and sisters.  Then  came a sharp pain in my breast as if a vein had burst or a nerve had  been severed, and I knew not which way to turn to conceal my anguish.    She soon raised herself again, placed her hand upon my forehead and  looked down into my heart so deeply that I felt I had not a thought  invisible to her.  She slowly drew the last ring from her finger, gave  it to me and said; \"I intended to have taken this with me, when I went  from you, but it is better you should wear it and think of me when I am  no longer with you.  Read the words engraved upon the ring: 'As God  wills.'  You have a passionate heart, easily moved.  May life subdue  but not harden it.\"  Then she kissed me as she had her brothers and  gave me the ring.    All my feelings I do not truly know.  I had then grown up to boyhood,  and the mild beauty of the suffering angel could not linger in my young  heart without alluring it.  I loved her as only a boy can love, and  boys love with an intensity and truth and purity which few preserve in  their youth and manhood; but I believed she belonged to the \"strange  people\" to whom you are not allowed to speak of love.  I scarcely  understood the earnest words she spoke to me.  I only felt that her  soul was as near to mine as one human soul can be to another.  All  bitterness was gone from my heart.  I felt myself no longer alone, no  longer a stranger, no longer shut out.  I was by her, with her and in  her.  I thought it might be a sacrifice for her to give me the ring,  and that she might have preferred to take it to the grave with her, and  a feeling arose in my soul which overshadowed all other feelings, and I  said with quivering voice: \"Thou must keep the ring if thou dost not  wish to give it to me; for what is thine is mine.\"  She looked at me a  moment surprised and thoughtfully.  Then she took the ring, placed it  on her finger, kissed me once more on the forehead, and said gently to  me: \"Thou knowest"]]]
