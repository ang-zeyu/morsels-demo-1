And, practically, that horrid 'People's     Charter' actually became the political programme of the very     manufacturers who had opposed it to the last.  'The Abolition of the     Property Qualification' and 'Vote by Ballot' are now the law of the     land.  The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 make a near approach to     'universal suffrage,' at least such as it now exists in Germany; the     Redistribution Bill now before Parliament creates 'equal electoral     districts'--on the whole not more unequal than those of Germany;     'payment of members,' and shorter, if not actually 'annual     Parliaments,' are visibly looming in the distance--and yet there are     people who say that Chartism is dead.       \"The Revolution of 1848, not less than many of its predecessors, has     had strange bedfellows and successors.  The very people who put it     down have become, as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary     executors.  Louis Napoleon had to create an independent and united     Italy, Bismarck had to revolutionise Germany and to restore Hungarian     independence, and the English manufacturers had to enact the People's     Charter.       \"For England, the effects of this domination of the manufacturing     capitalists were at first startling.  Trade revived and extended to a     degree unheard of even in this cradle of modern industry; the previous     astounding creations of steam and machinery dwindled into nothing     compared with the immense mass of productions of the twenty years from     1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figures of exports and imports, of     wealth accumulated in the hands of capitalists and of human working     power concentrated in the large towns.  The progress was indeed     interrupted, as before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well     as in 1866; but these revulsions were now considered as natural,     inevitable events, which must be fatalistically submitted to, and     which always set themselves right in the end.       \"And the condition of the working-class during this period?  There was     temporary improvement even for the great mass.  But this improvement     always was reduced to the old level by the influx of the great body of     the unemployed reserve, by the constant superseding of bands by new     machinery, by the immigration of the agricultural population, now,     too, more and more superseded by machines.       \"A permanent improvement can be recognised for two 'protected'     sections only of the working-class.  Firstly, the factory hands.  The     fixing by Act of Parliament of their working-day within relatively     rational limits has restored their physical constitution and endowed     them with a moral superiority, enhanced by their local concentration.     They are undoubtedly better off than before 1848.  The best proof is     that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoked by the     manufacturers in their own interests, as the only means of securing a     reduced production.  You can never get the masters to agree to work     'short time,' let manufactured goods be ever so unsaleable; but get     the workpeople to strike, and the masters shut their factories to a     man.       \"Secondly, the great Trades' Unions.  They are the organisations of     those trades in which the labour of _grown-up men_ predominates, or is     alone applicable.  Here the competition neither of women and children     nor of machinery has so far weakened their organised strength.  The     engineers, the carpenters, and joiners, the bricklayers, are each of     them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayers     and bricklayers' labourers, they can even successfully resist the     introduction of machinery.  That their condition has remarkably     improved since 1848 there can be no doubt, and the best proof of this     is in the fact, that for more than fifteen years not only have their     employers been with them, but they with their employers, upon     exceedingly good terms.  They form an aristocracy among the working-     class; they have succeeded in enforcing for themselves a relatively     comfortable position, and they accept it as final.  They are the model     working-men of Messrs. Leone Levi & Giffen, and they are very nice     people indeed nowadays to deal with, for any sensible capitalist in     particular and for the whole capitalist class in general.       \"But as to the great mass of working-people, the state of misery and     insecurity in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.  The     East End of London is an everspreading pool of stagnant misery and     desolation, of starvation when out of work, and degradation, physical     and moral, when in work.  And so in all other large towns--abstraction     made of the privileged minority of the workers; and so in the smaller     towns and in the agricultural districts.  The law which reduces the     _value_ of labour-power to the value of the necessary means of     subsistence, and the other law which reduces its _average price_, as a     rule, to the minimum of those means of subsistence, these laws act     upon them with the irresistible force of an automatic engine, which     crushes them between its wheels.       \"This, then, was the position created by the Free Trade policy of     1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturing     capitalists.  But, then, a change came.  The crash of 1866 was,     indeed, followed by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that     did not last.  We did not, indeed, pass through the full crisis at the     time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a     chronic state of stagnation in all dominant branches of industry.     Neither will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for     prosperity to which we used to be entitled before and after it.  A     dull depression, a chronic glut of all markets for all trades, that is     what we have been living in for nearly ten years.  How is this?       \"The Free Trade theory was based upon one assumption: that England was     to be the one great manufacturing centre of an agricultural world.  And     the actual fact is that this assumption has turned out to be a pure     delusion.  The conditions of modern industry, steam-power and     machinery, can be established wherever there is fuel, especially     coals.  And other countries beside England,--France, Belgium, Germany,     America, even Russia,--have coals.  And the people over there did not     see the advantage of being turned into Irish pauper farmers merely for     the greater wealth and glory of English capitalists.  They set     resolutely about manufacturing, not only for themselves, but for the     rest of the world; and the consequence is, that the manufacturing     monopoly enjoyed by England for nearly a century is irretrievably     broken up.       \"But the manufacturing monopoly of England is the pivot of the present     social system of England.  Even while that monopoly lasted, the     markets could not keep pace with the increasing productivity of     English manufacturers; the decennial crises were the consequence.  And     new markets are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the     negroes of the Congo are now to be forced into the civilisation     attendant upon Manchester calicos, Staffordshire pottery, and     Birmingham hardware.  How will it be when Continental, and especially     American, goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities--when the     predominating share, still held by British manufacturers, will become     reduced from year to year?  Answer, Free Trade, thou universal     panacea.       \"I am not the first to point this out.  Already, in 1883, at the     Southport meeting of the British Association, Mr. Inglis Palgrave, the     President of the Economic section, stated plainly that 'the days of     great trade profits in England were over, and there was a pause in the     progress of several great branches of industrial labour.  _The country     might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state_.'       \"But what is to be the consequence?  Capitalist production _cannot_     stop.  It must go on increasing and expanding, or it must die.  Even     now, the mere reduction of England's lion's share in the supply of the     world's markets means stagnation, distress, excess of capital here,     excess of unemployed workpeople there.  What will it be when the     increase of yearly production is brought to a complete stop?       \"Here is the vulnerable place, the heel of Achilles, for capitalistic     production.  Its very basis is the necessity of constant expansion,     and this constant expansion now becomes impossible.  It ends in a     deadlock.  Every year England is brought nearer face to face with the     question: either the country must go to pieces, or capitalist     production must.  Which is it to be?       \"And the working-class?  If even under the unparalleled commercial and     industrial expansion, from 1848 to 1866, they have had to undergo such     misery; if even then the great bulk of them experienced at best but a     temporary improvement of their condition, while only a small,     privileged, 'protected' minority was permanently benefited, what will     it be when this dazzling period is brought finally to a close; when     the present dreary stagnation shall not only become intensified, but     this, its intensified condition, shall become the permanent and normal     state of English trade?       \"The truth is this: during the period of England's industrial monopoly     the English working-class have, to a certain extent, shared in the     benefits of the monopoly.  These benefits were very unequally     parcelled out amongst them; the privileged minority pocketed most, but     even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#3)"],[1,"turned towards Him Who is the Object of  the adoration of the entire creation, and by them the hearts of the  righteous have found rest and composure, could ye but know it! Through  them the earth hath been established, the clouds have rained down their  bounty, and the bread of knowledge hath descended from the heaven of  grace, could ye but perceive it!    16 These souls are the protectors of the Cause of God on earth, who shall  preserve its beauty from the obscuring dust of idle fancies and vain  imaginings. In the path of their Lord they shall not fear for their lives;  rather will they sacrifice their all in their eagerness to behold the face  of their Well-Beloved when once He hath appeared in this Name, the  Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Most Holy.    17 O Living Temple! Arise by the power of Thy Self in such wise that all  created things will be moved to arise with Thee. Aid, then, Thy Lord  through such ascendancy and might as We have bestowed upon Thee. Take heed  lest Thou falter on that Day when all created things are filled with  dismay; rather be Thou the revealer of My name, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. Assist Thy Lord to the utmost of Thine ability, and pay  no heed to the peoples of the world, for that which their mouths utter is  like unto the droning of a gnat in an endless valley. Quaff the water of  life in My name, the All-Merciful, and proffer unto the near ones amongst  the inmates of this lofty station that which shall cause them to become  detached from all names and enter beneath this blessed and  all-encompassing shadow.    18 O Living Temple! Through Thee have We gathered together all created  things, whether in the heavens or on the earth, and called them to account  for that which We had covenanted with them before the foundation of the  world. And lo, but for a few radiant faces and eloquent tongues, We found  most of the people dumbfounded, their eyes staring up in fear. From the  former We brought forth the creation of all that hath been and all that  shall be. These are they whose countenances God hath graciously turned  away from the face of the unbelievers, and whom He hath sheltered beneath  the shadow of the Tree of His own Being; they upon whose hearts He hath  bestowed the gift of peace and tranquillity, and whom He hath strengthened  and assisted through the hosts of the seen and the unseen.    19 O Eyes of this Temple! Look not upon the heavens and that which they  contain, nor upon the earth and them that dwell thereon, for We have  created you to behold Our own Beauty: See it now before you! Withhold not  your gaze therefrom, and deprive not yourselves of the Beauty of your  Lord, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Erelong shall We bring into  being through you keen and penetrating eyes that will contemplate the  manifold signs of their Creator and turn away from all that is perceived  by the people of the world. Through you shall We bestow the power of  vision upon whomsoever We desire, and lay hold upon those who have  deprived themselves of this gracious bounty. These, verily, have drunk  from the cup of delusion, though they perceive it not.    20 O Ears of this Temple! Purge yourselves from all idle clamour and  hearken unto the voice of your Lord. He, verily, revealeth unto you, from  the Throne of glory, that there is none other God save Me, the  All-Glorious, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  Erelong shall We bring into being through you pure and undefiled ears  which will heed the Word of God and that which hath appeared from the  Dayspring of the Utterance of your Lord, the All-Merciful. They shall  assuredly perceive the sweet accents of Divine Revelation that proceed  from these most blessed and hallowed precincts.    21 O Tongue of this Temple! We, verily, have created thee through Our  name, the All-Merciful, have taught thee whatsoever had remained concealed  in the Bayan, and have bestowed upon thee the power of utterance, that  thou mayest make mention of Mine exalted Self amidst My creatures.  Proclaim, then, this wondrous and mighty Remembrance, and fear not the  manifestations of the Evil One. Thou wert called into being for this very  purpose by virtue of My transcendent and all-compelling command. Through  thee have We unloosed the Tongue of Utterance to expound all that hath  been, and We shall again, by My sovereign power, unloose it to speak of  that which is yet to come. Erelong shall We bring into being through thee  eloquent tongues that will praise and extol Me amongst the Concourse on  high and amidst the peoples of the world. Thus have the verses of God been  revealed, and thus hath it been decreed by the Lord of all names and  attributes. Thy Lord, verily, is the True One, the Knower of things  unseen. Nothing whatsoever shall prevent these tongues from magnifying  their Creator. Through them, all created things shall arise to glorify the  Lord of names and to bear witness that there is none other God save Me,  the All-Powerful, the Most-Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Nor shall those who  make mention of Me speak aught unless they be inspired by this Tongue from  its lofty station. Few, however, are they who understand! No tongue is  there that speaketh not the praises of its Lord and maketh not mention of  His Name. Amongst the people, however, are those who understand and utter  praises, and those who utter praises, yet understand not.    22 O Maid of inner meanings! Step out of the chamber of utterance by the  leave of God, the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Reveal, then, thyself  adorned with the raiment of the celestial Realm, and proffer with thy ruby  fingers the wine of the heavenly Dominion, that haply the denizens of this  world may perceive the light that shone forth from the Kingdom of God when  the Daystar of eternity appeared above the horizon of glory. Perchance  they may arise before the dwellers of earth and heaven to extol and  magnify this Youth Who hath established Himself in the midmost heart of  Paradise upon the throne of His name, the All-Sufficing Helper--He upon  Whose countenance shineth the brightness of the All-Merciful, from Whose  gaze appear the glances of the All-Glorious, and in Whose ways are  revealed the tokens and evidences of God, the omnipotent Protector, the  Almighty, the All-Loving.    23 Grieve not if none be found to accept the crimson wine proffered by Thy  snow-white hand and to seize it in the name of Thy Lord, the Most Exalted,  the Most High--He Who hath appeared again in His name, the Most Glorious.  Leave this people unto themselves, and repair unto the Tabernacle of  majesty and glory, wherein Thou shalt encounter a people whose faces shine  as brightly as the sun in its noontide splendour, and who praise and extol  their Lord in this Name that hath arisen, in the plenitude of might and  power, to assume the throne of independent sovereignty. From their lips  Thou shalt hear naught but the strains of My glorification and praise;  unto this Thy Lord beareth Me witness. The existence of these people,  however, hath remained concealed from the eyes of all who, from  everlasting, have been created through the Word of God. Thus have We made  plain Our meaning and set forth Our verses, that perchance men may reflect  upon the signs and tokens of their Lord.    24 These are they who, in truth, were not enjoined to prostrate themselves  before Adam.(1) They have never turned away from the countenance of Thy  Lord, and partake at every moment of the gifts and delights of holiness.  Thus hath the Pen of the All-Merciful set forth the secrets of all things,  be they of the past or of the future. Would that the world might  understand! Erelong shall God make manifest this people upon the earth,  and through them shall exalt His name, diffuse His signs, uphold His  words, and proclaim His verses, in spite of those that have repudiated His  truth, gainsaid His sovereignty, and cavilled at His signs.    25 O Beauty of the All-Glorious! Shouldst Thou chance upon this people and  enter their presence, recount unto them that which this Youth hath related  unto Thee concerning Himself and the things that have befallen Him, that  they may come to know what hath been inscribed upon the Preserved Tablet.  Acquaint them with the tidings of this Youth, and with the trials and  tribulations He hath suffered, that they may become mindful of Mine  afflictions, and be of them that understand. Recount, then, unto them how  We singled out for Our favour one of Our brothers,(2) how We imparted unto  him a dewdrop from the fathomless ocean of knowledge, clothed him with the  garment of one of Our Names, and exalted him to such a station that all  were moved to extol him, and how We so protected him from the harm of the  malevolent as to disarm even the mightiest amongst them.    26 We arose before the peoples of earth and heaven at a time when all had  determined to slay us. While dwelling in their midst, We continually made  mention of the Lord, celebrated His praise, and stood firm in His Cause,  until at last the Word of God was vindicated amongst His creatures, His  signs were spread abroad, His power exalted, and His sovereignty revealed  in its full splendour. To this bear witness all His honoured servants. Yet  when My brother beheld the rising fame of the Cause, he became filled with  arrogance and pride. Thereupon he emerged from behind the veil of  concealment, rose up against Me, disputed My verses, denied My testimony,  and repudiated My signs. Nor would his hunger be appeased unless he were  to devour My flesh and drink My blood. To this testify such of God's  servants as have accompanied Him in His exile, and they that enjoy near  access unto Him.    27 To this end he conferred with one of My servants(3) and sought to win  him over to his own designs; whereupon the Lord despatched unto Mine  assistance the hosts of the seen and the unseen,"]]]
