Most of all, it fructifies our  independence, and it reanimates our interest, to see our subject at two  different angles,--to get a stereoscopic view, so to speak, of the  youthful organism who is our enemy, and, while handling him with all our  concrete tact and divination, to be able, at the same time, to represent  to ourselves the curious inner elements of his mental machine. Such a  complete knowledge as this of the pupil, at once intuitive and analytic,  is surely the knowledge at which every teacher ought to aim.    Fortunately for you teachers, the elements of the mental machine can be  clearly apprehended, and their workings easily grasped. And, as the most  general elements and workings are just those parts of psychology which  the teacher finds most directly useful, it follows that the amount of  this science which is necessary to all teachers need not be very great.  Those who find themselves loving the subject may go as far as they  please, and become possibly none the worse teachers for the fact, even  though in some of them one might apprehend a little loss of balance from  the tendency observable in all of us to overemphasize certain special  parts of a subject when we are studying it intensely and abstractly. But  for the great majority of you a general view is enough, provided it be a  true one; and such a general view, one may say, might almost be written  on the palm of one's hand.    Least of all need you, merely _as teachers_, deem it part of your duty  to become contributors to psychological science or to make psychological  observations in a methodical or responsible manner. I fear that some of  the enthusiasts for child-study have thrown a certain burden on you in  this way. By all means let child-study go on,--it is refreshing all our  sense of the child's life. There are teachers who take a spontaneous  delight in filling syllabuses, inscribing observations, compiling  statistics, and computing the per cent. Child-study will certainly  enrich their lives. And, if its results, as treated statistically, would  seem on the whole to have but trifling value, yet the anecdotes and  observations of which it in part consist do certainly acquaint us more  intimately with our pupils. Our eyes and ears grow quickened to discern  in the child before us processes similar to those we have read of as  noted in the children,--processes of which we might otherwise have  remained inobservant. But, for Heaven's sake, let the rank and file of  teachers be passive readers if they so prefer, and feel free not to  contribute to the accumulation. Let not the prosecution of it be  preached as an imperative duty or imposed by regulation on those to whom  it proves an exterminating bore, or who in any way whatever miss in  themselves the appropriate vocation for it. I cannot too strongly agree  with my colleague, Professor Muensterberg, when he says that the  teacher's attitude toward the child, being concrete and ethical, is  positively opposed to the psychological observer's, which is abstract  and analytic. Although some of us may conjoin the attitudes  successfully, in most of us they must conflict.    The worst thing that can happen to a good teacher is to get a bad  conscience about her profession because she feels herself hopeless as a  psychologist. Our teachers are overworked already. Every one who adds a  jot or tittle of unnecessary weight to their burden is a foe of  education. A bad conscience increases the weight of every other burden;  yet I know that child-study, and other pieces of psychology as well,  have been productive of bad conscience in many a really innocent  pedagogic breast. I should indeed be glad if this passing word from me  might tend to dispel such a bad conscience, if any of you have it; for  it is certainly one of those fruits of more or less systematic  mystification of which I have already complained. The best teacher may  be the poorest contributor of child-study material, and the best  contributor may be the poorest teacher. No fact is more palpable than  this.    So much for what seems the most reasonable general attitude of the  teacher toward the subject which is to occupy our attention.          II. THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS      I said a few minutes ago that the most general elements and workings of  the mind are all that the teacher absolutely needs to be acquainted with  for his purposes.    Now the _immediate_ fact which psychology, the science of mind, has to  study is also the most general fact. It is the fact that in each of us,  when awake (and often when asleep), _some kind of consciousness is  always going on_. There is a stream, a succession of states, or waves,  or fields (or of whatever you please to call them), of knowledge, of  feeling, of desire, of deliberation, etc., that constantly pass and  repass, and that constitute our inner life. The existence of this stream  is the primal fact, the nature and origin of it form the essential  problem, of our science. So far as we class the states or fields of  consciousness, write down their several natures, analyze their contents  into elements, or trace their habits of succession, we are on the  descriptive or analytic level. So far as we ask where they come from or  why they are just what they are, we are on the explanatory level.    In these talks with you, I shall entirely neglect the questions that  come up on the explanatory level. It must be frankly confessed that in  no fundamental sense do we know where our successive fields of  consciousness come from, or why they have the precise inner constitution  which they do have. They certainly follow or accompany our brain states,  and of course their special forms are determined by our past experiences  and education. But, if we ask just _how_ the brain conditions them, we  have not the remotest inkling of an answer to give; and, if we ask just  how the education moulds the brain, we can speak but in the most  abstract, general, and conjectural terms. On the other hand, if we  should say that they are due to a spiritual being called our Soul, which  reacts on our brain states by these peculiar forms of spiritual energy,  our words would be familiar enough, it is true; but I think you will  agree that they would offer little genuine explanatory meaning. The  truth is that we really _do not know_ the answers to the problems on the  explanatory level, even though in some directions of inquiry there may  be promising speculations to be found. For our present purposes I shall  therefore dismiss them entirely, and turn to mere description. This  state of things was what I had in mind when, a moment ago, I said there  was no 'new psychology' worthy of the name.    _We have thus fields of consciousness_,--that is the first general fact;  and the second general fact is that the concrete fields are always  complex. They contain sensations of our bodies and of the objects around  us, memories of past experiences and thoughts of distant things,  feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, desires and aversions, and  other emotional conditions, together with determinations of the will, in  every variety of permutation and combination.    In most of our concrete states of consciousness all these different  classes of ingredients are found simultaneously present to some degree,  though the relative proportion they bear to one another is very  shifting. One state will seem to be composed of hardly anything but  sensations, another of hardly anything but memories, etc. But around the  sensation, if one consider carefully, there will always be some fringe  of thought or will, and around the memory some margin or penumbra of  emotion or sensation.    In most of our fields of consciousness there is a core of sensation that  is very pronounced. You, for example, now, although you are also  thinking and feeling, are getting through your eyes sensations of my  face and figure, and through your ears sensations of my voice. The  sensations are the _centre_ or _focus_, the thoughts and feelings the  _margin_, of your actually present conscious field.    On the other hand, some object of thought, some distant image, may have  become the focus of your mental attention even while I am  speaking,--your mind, in short, may have wandered from the lecture; and,  in that case, the sensations of my face and voice, although not  absolutely vanishing from your conscious field, may have taken up there  a very faint and marginal place.    Again, to take another sort of variation, some feeling connected with  your own body may have passed from a marginal to a focal place, even  while I speak.    The expressions 'focal object' and 'marginal object,' which we owe to  Mr. Lloyd Morgan, require, I think, no further explanation. The  distinction they embody is a very important one, and they are the first  technical terms which I shall ask you to remember.           *       *       *       *       *    In the successive mutations of our fields of consciousness, the process  by which one dissolves into another is often very gradual, and all sorts  of inner rearrangements of contents occur. Sometimes the focus remains  but little changed, while the margin alters rapidly. Sometimes the focus  alters, and the margin stays. Sometimes focus and margin change places.  Sometimes, again, abrupt alterations of the whole field occur. There can  seldom be a sharp description. All we know is that, for the most part,  each field has a sort of practical unity for its possessor, and that  from this practical point of view we can class a field with other fields  similar to it, by calling it a state of emotion, of perplexity, of  sensation, of abstract thought, of volition, and the like.    Vague and hazy as such an account of our stream of consciousness may be,  it is at least secure from positive error and free from admixture of  conjecture or hypothesis. An influential school of psychology, seeking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#3)"],[1,"case would be to accept /S/a@nkara's  interpretations as they stand, or at the utmost to attempt to make out,  if at all possible, by a careful comparison of /S/a@nkara's bhashya with  the text of the Sutras, whether the former in all cases faithfully  represents the purport of the latter.    In the most recent book of note which at all enters into the question as  to how far we have to accept /S/a@nkara as a guide to the right  understanding of the Sutras (Mr. A. Gough's Philosophy of the  Upanishads) the view is maintained (pp. 239 ff.) that /S/a@nkara is the  generally recognised expositor of true Vedanta doctrine, that that  doctrine was handed down by an unbroken series of teachers intervening  between him and the Sutrakara, and that there existed from the beginning  only one Vedanta doctrine, agreeing in all essential points with the  doctrine known to us from /S/a@nkara's writings. Mr. Gough undertakes to  prove this view, firstly, by a comparison of /S/a@nkara's system with  the teaching of the Upanishads themselves; and, secondly, by a  comparison of the purport of the Sutras--as far as that can be made out  independently of the commentaries--with the interpretations given of  them by /S/a@nkara. To both these points we shall revert later on.  Meanwhile, I only wish to remark concerning the former point that, even  if we could show with certainty that all the Upanishads propound one and  the same doctrine, there yet remains the undeniable fact of our being  confronted by a considerable number of essentially differing theories,  all of which claim to be founded on the Upanishads. And with regard to  the latter point I have to say for the present that, as long as we have  only /S/a@nkara's bhashya before us, we are naturally inclined to find  in the Sutras--which, taken by themselves, are for the greater part  unintelligible--the meaning which /S/a@nkara ascribes to them; while a  reference to other bhashyas may not impossibly change our views at  once.--Meanwhile, we will consider the question as to the unbroken  uniformity of Vedantic tradition from another point or view, viz. by  enquiring whether or not the Sutras themselves, and the  /S/a@nkara-bhashya, furnish any indications of there having existed  already at an early time essentially different Vedantic systems or lines  of Vedantic speculation.    Beginning with the Sutras, we find that they supply ample evidence to  the effect that already at a very early time, viz. the period antecedent  to the final composition of the Vedanta-sutras in their present shape,  there had arisen among the chief doctors of the Vedanta differences of  opinion, bearing not only upon minor points of doctrine, but affecting  the most essential parts of the system. In addition to Badaraya/n/a  himself, the reputed author of the Sutras, the latter quote opinions  ascribed to the following teachers: Atreya, A/s/marathya, Au/d/ulomi,  Karsh/n/agini, Ka/s/ak/ri/tsna, Jaimini, Badari. Among the passages  where diverging views of those teachers are recorded and contrasted  three are of particular importance. Firstly, a passage in the fourth  pada of the fourth adhyaya (Sutras 5-7), where the opinions of various  teachers concerning the characteristics of the released soul are given,  and where the important discrepancy is noted that, according to  Au/d/ulomi, its only characteristic is thought (/k/aitanya), while  Jaimini maintains that it possesses a number of exalted qualities, and  Badaraya/n/a declares himself in favour of a combination of those two  views.--The second passage occurs in the third pada of the fourth  adhyaya (Sutras 7-14), where Jaimini maintains that the soul of him who  possesses the lower knowledge of Brahman goes after death to the highest  Brahman, while Badari--whose opinion is endorsed by /S/a@nkara--teaches  that it repairs to the lower Brahman only--Finally, the third and most  important passage is met with in the fourth pada of the first adhyaya  (Sutras 20-22), where the question is discussed why in a certain passage  of the Brhadara/n/yaka Brahman is referred to in terms which are  strictly applicable to the individual soul only. In connexion therewith  the Sutras quote the views of three ancient teachers about the relation  in which the individual soul stands to Brahman. According to  A/s/marathya (if we accept the interpretation of his view given by  /S/a@nkara and /S/a@nkara's commentators) the soul stands to Brahman in  the bhedabheda relation, i.e. it is neither absolutely different nor  absolutely non-different from it, as sparks are from fire. Audulomi, on  the other hand, teaches that the soul is altogether different from  Brahman up to the time when obtaining final release it is merged in it,  and Ka/s/ak/ri/tsna finally upholds the doctrine that the soul is  absolutely non-different from Brahman; which, in, some way or other  presents itself as the individual soul.    That the ancient teachers, the ripest outcome of whose speculations and  discussions is embodied in the Vedanta-sutras, disagreed among  themselves on points of vital importance is sufficiently proved by the  three passages quoted. The one quoted last is specially significant as  showing that recognised authorities--deemed worthy of being quoted in  the Sutras--denied that doctrine on which the whole system of /S/a@nkara  hinges, viz. the doctrine of the absolute identity of the individual  soul with Brahman.    Turning next to the /S/a@nkara-bhashya itself, we there also meet with  indications that the Vedantins were divided among themselves on  important points of dogma. These indications are indeed not numerous:  /S/a@nkara, does not on the whole impress one as an author particularly  anxious to strengthen his own case by appeals to ancient authorities, a  peculiarity of his which later writers of hostile tendencies have not  failed to remark and criticise. But yet more than once /S/a@nkara also  refers to the opinion of 'another,' viz., commentator of the Sutras, and  in several places /S/a@nkara's commentators explain that the 'other'  meant is the V/ri/ttikara (about whom more will be said shortly). Those  references as a rule concern minor points of exegesis, and hence throw  little or no light on important differences of dogma; but there are two  remarks of /S/a@nkara's at any rate which are of interest in this  connexion. The one is made with reference to Sutras 7-14 of the third  pada of the fourth adhyaya; 'some,' he says there, 'declare those  Sutras, which I look upon as setting forth the siddhanta view, to state  merely the purvapaksha;' a difference of opinion which, as we have seen  above, affects the important question as to the ultimate fate of those  who have not reached the knowledge of the highest Brahman.--And under I,  3, 19 /S/a@nkara, after having explained at length that the individual  soul as such cannot claim any reality, but is real only in so far as it  is identical with Brahman, adds the following words, 'apare tu vadina/h/  paramarthikam eva jaiva/m/ rupam iti manyante asmadiya/s/ /k/a ke/k/it,'  i.e. other theorisers again, and among them some of ours, are of opinion  that the individual soul as such is real.' The term 'ours,' here made  use of, can denote only the Aupanishadas or Vedantins, and it thus  appears that /S/a@nkara himself was willing to class under the same  category himself and philosophers who--as in later times the Ramanujas  and others--looked upon the individual soul as not due to the fictitious  limitations of Maya, but as real in itself; whatever may be the relation  in which they considered it to stand to the highest Self.    From what precedes it follows that the Vedantins of the school to which  /S/a@nkara himself belonged acknowledged the existence of Vedantic  teaching of a type essentially different from their own. We must now  proceed to enquire whether the Ramanuja system, which likewise claims to  be Vedanta, and to be founded on the Vedanta-sutras, has any title to be  considered an ancient system and the heir of a respectable tradition.    It appears that Ramanuja claims--and by Hindu writers is generally  admitted--to follow in his bhashya the authority of Bodhayana, who had  composed a v/ri/tti on the Sutras. Thus we read in the beginning of the  /S/ri-bhashya (Pandit, New Series, VII, p. 163),  'Bhagavad-bodhayanak/ri/ta/m/ vistirna/m/ brahmasutra-v/ri/tti/m/  purva/k/arya/h/ sa/m/kikshipus tanmatanusare/n/a sutrakshara/n/i  vyakhyasyante.' Whether the Bodhayana to whom that v/ri/tti is ascribed  is to be identified with the author of the Kalpa-sutra, and other works,  cannot at present be decided. But that an ancient v/ri/tti on the Sutras  connected with Bodhayana's name actually existed, there is not any  reason to doubt. Short quotations from it are met with in a few places  of the /S/ri-bhashya, and, as we have seen above, /S/a@nkara's  commentators state that their author's polemical remarks are directed  against the V/ri/ttikara. In addition to Bodhayana, Ramanuja appeals to  quite a series of ancient teachers--purva/k/aryas--who carried on the  true tradition as to the teaching of the Vedanta and the meaning of the  Sutras. In the Vedarthasa@ngraha--a work composed by Ramanuja  himself--we meet in one place with the enumeration of the following  authorities: Bodhayana, /T/a@nka, Drami/d/a, Guhadeva, Kapardin,  Bharu/k/i, and quotations from the writings of some of these are not  unfrequent in the Vedarthasa@ngraha, as well as the /S/ri-bhashya. The  author most frequently quoted is Drami/d/a, who composed the  Drami/d/a-bhashya; he is sometimes referred to as the bhashyakara.  Another writer repeatedly quoted as the vakyakara is, I am told, to be  identified with the /T/a@nka mentioned above. I refrain from inserting  in this place the information concerning the relative age of these  writers which may be derived from the oral tradition of the Ramanuja  sect.
