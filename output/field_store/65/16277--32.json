They  cannot govern a word, and they cannot _express_ action, but are merely  _names_ of actions. They are only the husks of verbs, and are to be  rigidly distinguished from _gerunds_ (Secs. 272, 273).    To avoid difficulty, study carefully these examples:    The best thoughts and _sayings_ of the Greeks; the moon caused fearful  _forebodings_; in the _beginning_ of his life; he spread his  _blessings_ over the land; the great Puritan _awakening_; our birth is  but a sleep and a _forgetting_; a _wedding_ or a festival; the rude  _drawings_ of the book; masterpieces of the Socratic _reasoning_; the  _teachings_ of the High Spirit; those opinions and _feelings_; there  is time for such _reasonings_; the _well-being_ of her subjects; her  _longing_ for their favor; _feelings_ which their original _meaning_  will by no means justify; the main _bearings_ of this matter.      [Sidenote: _Underived abstract nouns._]    12. Some abstract nouns were not derived from any other part of  speech, but were framed directly for the expression of certain ideas  or phenomena. Such are _beauty_, _joy_, _hope_, _ease_, _energy_;  _day_, _night_, _summer_, _winter_; _shadow_, _lightning_, _thunder_,  etc.    The adjectives or verbs corresponding to these are either themselves  derived from the nouns or are totally different words; as  _glad_--_joy_, _hopeful_--_hope_, etc.        Exercises.    1. From your reading bring up sentences containing ten common nouns,  five proper, five abstract.    --NOTE.--Remember that all sentences are to be _selected_ from  standard literature.    2. Under what class of nouns would you place (_a_) the names of  diseases, as _pneumonia_, _pleurisy_, _catarrh_, _typhus_,  _diphtheria_; (_b_) branches of knowledge, as _physics_, _algebra_,  _geology_, _mathematics_?    3. Mention collective nouns that will embrace groups of each of the  following individual nouns:--      man    horse    bird    fish    partridge    pupil    bee    soldier    book    sailor    child    sheep    ship    ruffian    4. Using a dictionary, tell from what word each of these abstract  nouns is derived:--      sight    speech    motion    pleasure    patience    friendship    deceit    bravery    height    width    wisdom    regularity    advice    seizure    nobility    relief    death    raid    honesty    judgment    belief    occupation    justice    service    trail    feeling    choice    simplicity      SPECIAL USES OF NOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Nouns change by use._]    13. By being used so as to vary their usual meaning, nouns of one  class may be made to approach another class, or to go over to it  entirely. Since words alter their meaning so rapidly by a widening or  narrowing of their application, we shall find numerous examples of  this shifting from class to class; but most of them are in the  following groups. For further discussion see the remarks on articles  (p. 119).      [Sidenote: _Proper names transferred to common use._]    14. Proper nouns are used as common in either of two ways:--    (1) _The origin of a thing is used for the thing itself_: that is, the  name of the inventor may be applied to the thing invented, as a  _davy_, meaning the miner's lamp invented by Sir Humphry Davy; the  _guillotine_, from the name of Dr. Guillotin, who was its inventor. Or  the name of the country or city from which an article is derived is  used for the article: as _china_, from China; _arras_, from a town in  France; _port_ (wine), from Oporto, in Portugal; _levant_ and  _morocco_ (leather).    Some of this class have become worn by use so that at present we can  scarcely discover the derivation from the form of the word; for  example, the word _port_, above. Others of similar character are  _calico_, from Calicut; _damask_, from Damascus; _currants_, from  Corinth; etc.    (2) _The name of a person or place noted for certain qualities is  transferred to any person or place possessing those qualities_;  thus,--         Hercules and Samson were noted for their strength, and we call a       very strong man _a Hercules_ or _a Samson_. Sodom was famous for       wickedness, and a similar place is called _a Sodom_ of sin.         _A Daniel_ come to judgment!--SHAKESPEARE.         If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, _a Locke_, _a       Lavoisier_, _a Hutton_, _a Bentham_, _a Fourier_, it imposes its       classification on other men, and lo! a new system.--EMERSON.      [Sidenote: _Names for things in bulk altered for separate portions._]    15. Material nouns may be used as class names. Instead of  considering the whole body of material of which certain uses are made,  one can speak of particular uses or phases of the substance; as--    (1) _Of individual objects_ made from metals or other substances  capable of being wrought into various shapes. We know a number of  objects made of iron. The material _iron_ embraces the metal contained  in them all; but we may say, \"The cook made the _irons_ hot,\"  referring to flat-irons; or, \"The sailor was put in _irons_\" meaning  chains of iron. So also we may speak of _a glass_ to drink from or to  look into; _a steel_ to whet a knife on; _a rubber_ for erasing marks;  and so on.    (2) _Of classes_ or _kinds_ of the same substance. These are the same  in material, but differ in strength, purity, etc. Hence it shortens  speech to make the nouns plural, and say _teas_, _tobaccos_, _paints_,  _oils_, _candies_, _clays_, _coals_.    (3) _By poetical use_, of certain words necessarily singular in idea,  which are made plural, or used as class nouns, as in the following:--         The lone and level _sands_ stretch far away.--SHELLEY.                              From all around--       Earth and her _waters_, and the depths of air--       Comes a still voice.--BRYANT.                              Their airy ears       _The winds_ have stationed on the mountain peaks.       --PERCIVAL.    (4) _Of detached portions_ of matter used as class names; as _stones_,  _slates_, _papers_, _tins_, _clouds_, _mists_, etc.      [Sidenote: _Personification of abstract ideas._]    16. Abstract nouns are frequently used as proper names by being  personified; that is, the ideas are spoken of as residing in living  beings. This is a poetic usage, though not confined to verse.         Next _Anger_ rushed; his eyes, on fire,        In lightnings owned his secret stings.--COLLINS.         _Freedom's_ fame finds wings on every wind.--BYRON.         _Death_, his mask melting like a nightmare dream, smiled.--HAYNE.         _Traffic_ has lain down to rest; and only _Vice_ and _Misery_, to       prowl or to moan like night birds, are abroad.--CARLYLE.      [Sidenote: _A halfway class of words. Class nouns in use, abstract in  meaning._]    17. Abstract nouns are made half abstract by being spoken of in  the plural.    They are not then pure abstract nouns, nor are they common class  nouns. For example, examine this:--         The _arts_ differ from the _sciences_ in this, that their power       is founded not merely on _facts_ which can be communicated, but       on _dispositions_ which require to be created.--RUSKIN.    When it is said that _art_ differs from _science_, that the power of  art is founded on _fact_, that _disposition_ is the thing to be  created, the words italicized are pure abstract nouns; but in case _an  art_ or _a science_, or _the arts_ and _sciences_, be spoken of, the  abstract idea is partly lost. The words preceded by the article _a_,  or made plural, are still names of abstract ideas, not material  things; but they widen the application to separate kinds of _art_ or  different branches of _science_. They are neither class nouns nor pure  abstract nouns: they are more properly called _half abstract_.    Test this in the following sentences:--         Let us, if we must have great _actions_, make our own       so.--EMERSON.         And still, as each repeated _pleasure_ tired, Succeeding _sports_       the mirthful band inspired.--GOLDSMITH.         But ah! those _pleasures_, _loves_, and _joys_          Which I too keenly taste,       The Solitary can despise.--BURNS.         All these, however, were mere _terrors_ of the night.--IRVING.      [Sidenote: _By ellipses, nouns used to modify._]    18. Nouns used as descriptive terms. Sometimes a noun is attached  to another noun to add to its meaning, or describe it; for example, \"a  _family_ quarrel,\" \"a _New York_ bank,\" \"the _State Bank Tax_ bill,\"  \"a _morning_ walk.\"    It is evident that these approach very near to the function of  adjectives. But it is better to consider them as nouns, for these  reasons: they do not give up their identity as nouns; they do not  express quality; they cannot be compared, as descriptive adjectives  are.    They are more like the possessive noun, which belongs to another word,  but is still a noun. They may be regarded as elliptical expressions,  meaning a walk _in the morning_, a bank _in New York_, a bill _as to  tax on the banks_, etc.    NOTE.--If the descriptive word be a _material_ noun, it may be  regarded as changed to an adjective. The term \"_gold_ pen\" conveys the  same idea as \"_golden_ pen,\" which contains a pure adjective.      WORDS AND WORD GROUPS USED AS NOUNS.    [Sidenote: _The noun may borrow from any part of speech, or from any  expression._]    19. Owing to the scarcity of distinctive forms, and to the  consequent flexibility of English speech, words which are usually  other parts of speech are often used as nouns; and various word groups  may take the place of nouns by being used as nouns.    [Sidenote: _Adjectives, Conjunctions, Adverbs._]    (1) _Other parts of speech_ used as nouns:--         _The great_, _the wealthy_, fear thy blow.--BURNS.         Every _why_ hath a _wherefore_.--SHAKESPEARE.         When I was young? Ah, woeful _When_!       Ah! for the change 'twixt _Now_ and _Then_!       --COLERIDGE.    (2) _Certain word"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#3)"],[1,"beasts, he moved with majestic deliberation when no  emergency prompted him to swift action.    Having dedicated his life to vengeance, vengeance became his natural  state and, therefore, no emergency, so he took his time in pursuit.  That he had not rested earlier was due to the fact that he had  felt no fatigue, his mind being occupied by thoughts of sorrow and  revenge; but now he realized that he was tired, and so he sought  a jungle giant that had harbored him upon more than a single other  jungle night.    Dark clouds moving swiftly across the heavens now and again eclipsed  the bright face of Goro, the moon, and forewarned the ape-man  of impending storm. In the depth of the jungle the cloud shadows  produced a thick blackness that might almost be felt--a blackness  that to you and me might have proven terrifying with its accompaniment  of rustling leaves and cracking twigs, and its even more suggestive  intervals of utter silence in which the crudest of imaginations  might have conjured crouching beasts of prey tensed for the fatal  charge; but through it Tarzan passed unconcerned, yet always alert.  Now he swung lightly to the lower terraces of the overarching  trees when some subtle sense warned him that Numa lay upon a kill  directly in his path, or again he sprang lightly to one side as  Buto, the rhinoceros, lumbered toward him along the narrow, deep-worn  trail, for the ape-man, ready to fight upon necessity's slightest  pretext, avoided unnecessary quarrels.    When he swung himself at last into the tree he sought, the moon was  obscured by a heavy cloud, and the tree tops were waving wildly in  a steadily increasing wind whose soughing drowned the lesser noises  of the jungle. Upward went Tarzan toward a sturdy crotch across which  he long since had laid and secured a little platform of branches.  It was very dark now, darker even than it had been before, for  almost the entire sky was overcast by thick, black clouds.    Presently the man-beast paused, his sensitive nostrils dilating as  he sniffed the air about him. Then, with the swiftness and agility of  a cat, he leaped far outward upon a swaying branch, sprang upward  through the darkness, caught another, swung himself upon it and  then to one still higher. What could have so suddenly transformed  his matter-of-fact ascent of the giant bole to the swift and wary  action of his detour among the branches? You or I could have seen  nothing--not even the little platform that an instant before had  been just above him and which now was immediately below--but as he  swung above it we should have heard an ominous growl; and then as  the moon was momentarily uncovered, we should have seen both the  platform, dimly, and a dark mass that lay stretched upon it--a dark  mass that presently, as our eyes became accustomed to the lesser  darkness, would take the form of Sheeta, the panther.    In answer to the cat's growl, a low and equally ferocious growl  rumbled upward from the ape-man's deep chest--a growl of warning  that told the panther he was trespassing upon the other's lair; but  Sheeta was in no mood to be dispossessed. With upturned, snarling  face he glared at the brown-skinned Tarmangani above him. Very slowly  the ape-man moved inward along the branch until he was directly  above the panther. In the man's hand was the hunting knife of his  long-dead father--the weapon that had first given him his real  ascendancy over the beasts of the jungle; but he hoped not to be  forced to use it, knowing as he did that more jungle battles were  settled by hideous growling than by actual combat, the law of bluff  holding quite as good in the jungle as elsewhere--only in matters  of love and food did the great beasts ordinarily close with fangs  and talons.    Tarzan braced himself against the bole of the tree and leaned closer  toward Sheeta.    \"Stealer of balus!\" he cried. The panther rose to a sitting position,  his bared fangs but a few feet from the ape-man's taunting face.  Tarzan growled hideously and struck at the cat's face with his  knife.  \"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" he roared.  \"This is Tarzan's  lair.  Go, or I will kill you.\"    Though he spoke in the language of the great apes of the jungle,  it is doubtful that Sheeta understood the words, though he knew  well enough that the hairless ape wished to frighten him from his  well-chosen station past which edible creatures might be expected  to wander sometime during the watches of the night.    Like lightning the cat reared and struck a vicious blow at his  tormentor with great, bared talons that might well have torn away  the ape-man's face had the blow landed; but it did not land--Tarzan  was even quicker than Sheeta.  As the panther came to all fours  again upon the little platform, Tarzan un-slung his heavy spear and  prodded at the snarling face, and as Sheeta warded off the blows,  the two continued their horrid duet of blood-curdling roars and  growls.    Goaded to frenzy the cat presently determined to come up after this  disturber of his peace; but when he essayed to leap to the branch  that held Tarzan he found the sharp spear point always in his  face, and each time as he dropped back he was prodded viciously in  some tender part; but at length, rage having conquered his better  judgment, he leaped up the rough bole to the very branch upon which  Tarzan stood.  Now the two faced each other upon even footing and  Sheeta saw a quick revenge and a supper all in one.  The hairless  ape-thing with the tiny fangs and the puny talons would be helpless  before him.    The heavy limb bent beneath the weight of the two beasts as Sheeta  crept cautiously out upon it and Tarzan backed slowly away, growling.  The wind had risen to the proportions of a gale so that even the  greatest giants of the forest swayed, groaning, to its force and  the branch upon which the two faced each other rose and fell like  the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  Goro was now entirely obscured,  but vivid flashes of lightning lit up the jungle at brief intervals,  revealing the grim tableau of primitive passion upon the swaying  limb.    Tarzan backed away, drawing Sheeta farther from the stem of the  tree and out upon the tapering branch, where his footing became  ever more precarious.  The cat, infuriated by the pain of spear  wounds, was overstepping the bounds of caution.  Already he had  reached a point where he could do little more than maintain a secure  footing, and it was this moment that Tarzan chose to charge.  With  a roar that mingled with the booming thunder from above he leaped  toward the panther, who could only claw futilely with one huge paw  while he clung to the branch with the other; but the ape-man did  not come within that parabola of destruction.  Instead he leaped  above menacing claws and snapping fangs, turning in mid-air  and  alighting upon Sheeta's back, and at the instant of impact  his knife  struck deep into the tawny side. Then Sheeta, impelled by pain and  hate and rage and the first law of Nature,  went mad. Screaming  and clawing he attempted to turn upon the ape-thing clinging to  his back. For an instant he toppled upon the now wildly gyrating  limb, clutched frantically to save himself, and then plunged downward  into the darkness with Tarzan still clinging to him. Crashing  through splintering branches the two fell. Not for an instant did  the ape-man consider relinquishing his death-hold upon his adversary.  He had entered the lists in mortal combat and true to the primitive  instincts of the wild--the unwritten law of the jungle--one or both  must die before the battle ended.    Sheeta, catlike, alighted upon four out-sprawled feet, the  weight  of the ape-man crushing him to earth, the long knife  again imbedded  in his side. Once the panther struggled to rise; but only to sink  to earth again. Tarzan felt the giant muscles relax beneath him.  Sheeta was dead. Rising, the ape-man placed a foot upon the body of  his vanquished foe, raised his face toward the thundering heavens,  and as the lightning flashed and the torrential rain broke upon  him, screamed forth the wild victory cry of the bull ape.    Having accomplished his aim and driven the enemy from his lair,  Tarzan gathered an armful of large fronds and climbed to his dripping  couch. Laying a few of the fronds upon the poles he lay down and  covered himself against the rain with the others, and despite the  wailing of the wind and the crashing of the thunder, immediately  fell asleep.          Chapter II    The Lion's Cave      The rain lasted for twenty-four hours and much of the time it fell  in torrents so that when it ceased, the trail he had been following  was entirely obliterated. Cold and uncomfortable--it was a savage  Tarzan who threaded the mazes of the soggy jungle. Manu, the  monkey, shivering and chattering in the dank trees, scolded and fled  at his approach. Even the panthers and the lions let the growling  Tarmangani pass unmolested.    When the sun shone again upon the second day and a wide, open plain  let the full heat of Kudu flood the chilled, brown body, Tarzan's  spirits rose; but it was still a sullen, surly brute that moved  steadily onward into the south where he hoped again to pick up the  trail of the Germans. He was now in German East Africa and it was  his intention to skirt the mountains west of Kilimanjaro, whose  rugged peaks he was quite willing to give a wide berth, and then  swing eastward along the south side of the range to the railway that  led to Tanga, for his experience among men suggested that it was  toward this railroad that German troops would be likely to converge.    Two days later, from the southern slopes of Kilimanjaro, he heard  the boom of cannon far away to the east. The afternoon had been  dull and cloudy and now as he was passing through a narrow gorge a  few great drops of rain began to splatter upon his naked shoulders.  Tarzan shook his head and growled"]]]
