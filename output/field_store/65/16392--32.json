William Rufus then took and  fortified Carlisle, seized part of Malcolm's lands in Cumberland, and  summoned him to Gloucester, where the two Kings, after all, quarrelled  and did not meet.  No sooner had Malcolm returned home than he led an  army into Northumberland, where he was defeated and slain, near Alnwick  (Nov. 13, 1093).  His son Edward fell with him, and his wife, St  Margaret, died in Edinburgh Castle: her body, under cloud of night, was  carried through the host of rebel Celts and buried at Dunfermline.    Margaret, a beautiful and saintly Englishwoman, had been the ruling  spirit of the reign in domestic and ecclesiastical affairs.  She had  civilised the Court, in matters of costume at least; she had read books  to the devoted Malcolm, who could not read; and he had been her  interpreter in her discussions with the Celtic-speaking clergy, whose  ideas of ritual differed from her own.  The famous Culdees, originally  ascetic hermits, had before this day united in groups living under  canonical rules, and, according to English observers, had ceased to be  bachelors.  Masses are said to have been celebrated by them in some  \"barbarous rite\"; Saturday was Sabbath; on Sunday men worked.  Lent  began, not on Ash Wednesday, but on the Monday following.  We have no  clearer account of the Culdee peculiarities that St Margaret reformed.  The hereditary tenure of benefices by lay protectors she did not reform,  but she restored the ruined cells of Iona, and established _hospitia_ for  pilgrims.  She was decidedly unpopular with her Celtic subjects, who now  made a struggle against English influences.    In the year of her death died Fothadh, the last Celtic bishop of St  Andrews, and the Celtic clergy were gradually superseded and replaced by  monks of English name, English speech, and English ideas--or rather the  ideas of western Europe.  Scotland, under Margaret's influence, became  more Catholic; the celibacy of the clergy was more strictly enforced (it  had almost lapsed), but it will be observed throughout that, of all  western Europe, Scotland was least overawed by Rome.  Yet for centuries  the Scottish Church was, in a peculiar degree, \"the daughter of Rome,\"  for not till about 1470 had she a Metropolitan, the Archbishop of St  Andrews.    On the deaths, in one year, of Malcolm, Margaret, and Fothadh, the last  Celtic bishop of St Andrews, the see for many years was vacant or merely  filled by transient bishops.  York and Canterbury were at feud for their  superiority over the Scottish Church; and the other sees were not  constituted and provided with bishops till the years 1115 (Glasgow),  1150,--Argyll not having a bishop till 1200.  In the absence of a  Metropolitan, episcopal elections had to be confirmed at Rome, which  would grant no Metropolitan, but forbade the Archbishop of York to claim  a superiority which would have implied, or prepared the way for, English  superiority over Scotland.  Meanwhile the expenses and delays of appeals  from bishops direct to Rome did not stimulate the affection of the  Scottish \"daughter of Rome.\"  The rights of the chapters of the  Cathedrals to elect their bishops, and other appointments to  ecclesiastical offices, in course of time were transferred to the Pope,  who negotiated with the king, and thus all manner of jobbery increased,  the nobles influencing the king in favour of their own needy younger  sons, and the Pope being amenable to various secular persuasions, so that  in every way the relations of Scotland with the Holy Father were  anomalous and irksome.    Scotland was, indeed, a country predestined to much ill fortune, to  tribulations against which human foresight could erect no defence.  But  the marriage of the Celtic Malcolm with the English Margaret, and the  friendly arrival of great nobles from the south, enabled Scotland to  receive the new ideas of feudal law in pacific fashion.  They were not  violently forced upon the English-speaking people of Lothian.        DYNASTY OF MALCOLM.      On the death of Malcolm the contest for the Crown lay between his  brother, Donald Ban, supported by the Celts; his son Duncan by his first  wife, a Norse woman (Duncan being then a hostage at the English Court,  who was backed by William Rufus); and thirdly, Malcolm's eldest son by  Margaret, Eadmund, the favourite with the anglicised south of the  country.  Donald Ban, after a brief period of power, was driven out by  Duncan (1094); Duncan was then slain by the Celts (1094).  Donald was  next restored, north of Forth, Eadmund ruling in the south, but was  dispossessed and blinded by Malcolm's son Eadgar, who reigned for ten  years (1097-1107), while Eadmund died in an English cloister.  Eadgar had  trouble enough on all sides, but the process of anglicising continued,  under himself, and later, under his brother, Alexander I., who ruled  north of Forth and Clyde; while the youngest brother, David, held Lothian  and Cumberland, with the title of Earl.  The sister of those sons of  Malcolm, Eadgyth (Matilda), married Henry I. of England in 1100.  There  seemed a chance that, north of Clyde and Forth, there would be a Celtic  kingdom; while Lothian and Cumbria would be merged in England.  Alexander  was mainly engaged in fighting the Moray claimants of his crown in the  north and in planting his religious houses, notably St Andrews, with  English Augustinian canons from York.  Canterbury and York contended for  ecclesiastical superiority over Scotland; after various adventures,  Robert, the prior of the Augustinians at Scone, was made Bishop of St  Andrews, being consecrated by Canterbury, in 1124; while York consecrated  David's bishop in Glasgow.  Thanks to the quarrels of the sees of York  and Canterbury, the Scottish clergy managed to secure their  ecclesiastical independence from either English see; and became, finally,  the most useful combatants in the long struggle for the independence of  the nation.  Rome, on the whole, backed that cause.  The Scottish  Catholic churchmen, in fact, pursued the old patriotic policy of  resistance to England till the years just preceding the Reformation, when  the people leaned to the reformed doctrines, and when Scottish national  freedom was endangered more by France than by England.          CHAPTER V.  DAVID I. AND HIS TIMES.      With the death of Alexander I. (April 25, 1124) and the accession of his  brother, David I., the deliberate Royal policy of introducing into  Scotland English law and English institutions, as modified by the Norman  rulers, was fulfilled.  David, before Alexander's death, was Earl of the  most English part of Lothian, the country held by Scottish kings, and  Cumbria; and resided much at the court of his brother-in-law, Henry I.  He  associated, when Earl, with nobles of Anglo-Norman race and language,  such as Moreville, Umfraville, Somerville, Gospatric, Bruce, Balliol, and  others; men with a stake in both countries, England and Scotland.  On  coming to the throne, David endowed these men with charters of lands in  Scotland.  With him came a cadet of the great Anglo-Breton House of  FitzAlan, who obtained the hereditary office of Seneschal or _Steward_ of  Scotland.  His patronymic, FitzAlan, merged in Stewart (later Stuart),  and the family cognizance, the _fesse chequy_ in azure and argent,  represents the Board of Exchequer.  The earliest Stewart holdings of land  were mainly in Renfrewshire; those of the Bruces were in Annandale.  These  two Anglo-Norman houses between them were to found the Stewart dynasty.    The wife of David, Matilda, widow of Simon de St Liz, was heiress of  Waltheof, sometime the Conqueror's Earl in Northumberland; and to gain,  through that connection, Northumberland for himself was the chief aim of  David's foreign policy,--an aim fertile in contentions.    We have not space to disentangle the intricacies of David's first great  domestic struggles; briefly, there was eternal dispeace caused by the  Celts, headed by claimants to the throne, the MacHeths, representing the  rights of Lulach, the ward of Macbeth. {20}  In 1130 the Celts were  defeated, and their leader, Angus, Earl of Moray, fell in fight near the  North Esk in Forfarshire.  His brother, Malcolm, by aid of David's Anglo-  Norman friends, was taken and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle.  The result  of this rising was that David declared the great and ancient Celtic  Earldom of Moray--the home of his dynastic Celtic rivals--forfeit to the  Crown.  He planted the region with English, Anglo-Norman, and Lowland  landholders, a great step in the anglicisation of his kingdom.  Thereafter, for several centuries, the strength of the Celts lay in the  west in Moidart, Knoydart, Morar, Mamore, Lochaber, and Kintyre, and in  the western islands, which fell into the hands of \"the sons of Somerled,\"  the Macdonalds.    In 1135-1136, on the death of Henry I., David, backing his own niece,  Matilda, as Queen of England in opposition to Stephen, crossed the Border  in arms, but was bought off.  His son Henry received the Honour of  Huntingdom, with the Castle of Carlisle, and a vague promise of  consideration of his claim to Northumberland.  In 1138, after a disturbed  interval, David led the whole force of his realm, from Orkney to  Galloway, into Yorkshire.  His Anglo-Norman friends, the Balliols and  Bruces, with the Archbishop of York, now opposed him and his son Prince  Henry.  On August 22, 1138, at Cowton Moor, near Northallerton, was  fought the great battle, named from the huge English sacred banner, \"The  Battle of the Standard.\"    In a military sense, the fact that here the men-at-arms and knights of  England fought as dismounted infantry, their horses being held apart in  reserve, is notable as preluding to the similar English tactics in their  French wars of the fourteenth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1,"cast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his  wife.    One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the  rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as  pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and  the old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.    It was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain  and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from  her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real  Princess.    \"Ah! we shall soon see that!\" thought the old Queen-mother; however, she  said not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the  bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas  on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over  the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.    Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.    The next morning she was asked how she had slept. \"Oh, very badly  indeed!\" she replied. \"I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night  through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard  under me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!\"    Now it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had  been able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses  and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a  delicate sense of feeling.    The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he  had found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the  cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they  are not lost.    Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?          THE SHOES OF FORTUNE    I. A Beginning    Every author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style  of writing. Those who do not like him, magnify it, shrug up their  shoulders, and exclaim--there he is again! I, for my part, know very  well how I can bring about this movement and this exclamation. It would  happen immediately if I were to begin here, as I intended to do, with:  \"Rome has its Corso, Naples its Toledo\"--\"Ah! that Andersen; there he is  again!\" they would cry; yet I must, to please my fancy, continue quite  quietly, and add: \"But Copenhagen has its East Street.\"    Here, then, we will stay for the present. In one of the houses not far  from the new market a party was invited--a very large party, in order,  as is often the case, to get a return invitation from the others. One  half of the company was already seated at the card-table, the other half  awaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady  of the house:    \"Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.\"    They had got just so far, and the conversation began to crystallise,  as it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world  supplied. Amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some  praised that period as far more interesting, far more poetical than our  own too sober present; indeed Councillor Knap defended this opinion  so warmly, that the hostess declared immediately on his side, and both  exerted themselves with unwearied eloquence. The Councillor boldly  declared the time of King Hans to be the noblest and the most happy  period.*    * A.D. 1482-1513      While the conversation turned on this subject, and was only for a moment  interrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth  reading, we will just step out into the antechamber, where cloaks,  mackintoshes, sticks, umbrellas, and shoes, were deposited. Here sat two  female figures, a young and an old one. One might have thought at first  they were servants come to accompany their mistresses home; but on  looking nearer, one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants; their  forms were too noble for that, their skin too fine, the cut of their  dress too striking. Two fairies were they; the younger, it is true,  was not Dame Fortune herself, but one of the waiting-maids of her  handmaidens who carry about the lesser good things that she distributes;  the other looked extremely gloomy--it was Care. She always attends to  her own serious business herself, as then she is sure of having it done  properly.    They were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas,  where they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only  executed a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from  a shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something  quite unusual.    \"I must tell you,\" said she, \"that to-day is my birthday; and in honor  of it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me,  which I am to carry to mankind. These shoes possess the property of  instantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period  in which he most wishes to be; every wish, as regards time or place, or  state of being, will be immediately fulfilled, and so at last man will  be happy, here below.\"    \"Do you seriously believe it?\" replied Care, in a severe tone of  reproach. \"No; he will be very unhappy, and will assuredly bless the  moment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes.\"    \"Stupid nonsense!\" said the other angrily. \"I will put them here by  the door. Some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong  ones--he will be a happy man.\"    Such was their conversation.      II. What Happened to the Councillor    It was late; Councillor Knap, deeply occupied with the times of King  Hans, intended to go home, and malicious Fate managed matters so that  his feet, instead of finding their way to his own galoshes, slipped  into those of Fortune. Thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the  well-lighted rooms into East Street. By the magic power of the shoes he  was carried back to the times of King Hans; on which account his foot  very naturally sank in the mud and puddles of the street, there having  been in those days no pavement in Copenhagen.    \"Well! This is too bad! How dirty it is here!\" sighed the Councillor.  \"As to a pavement, I can find no traces of one, and all the lamps, it  seems, have gone to sleep.\"    The moon was not yet very high; it was besides rather foggy, so that  in the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion. At the  next corner hung a votive lamp before a Madonna, but the light it gave  was little better than none at all; indeed, he did not observe it before  he was exactly under it, and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the  pictures which represented the well-known group of the Virgin and the  infant Jesus.    \"That is probably a wax-work show,\" thought he; \"and the people delay  taking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two.\"    A few persons in the costume of the time of King Hans passed quickly by  him.    \"How strange they look! The good folks come probably from a masquerade!\"    Suddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes; the bright blaze of a  fire shot up from time to time, and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend  with the bluish light of the torches. The Councillor stood still, and  watched a most strange procession pass by. First came a dozen drummers,  who understood pretty well how to handle their instruments; then came  halberdiers, and some armed with cross-bows. The principal person in the  procession was a priest. Astonished at what he saw, the Councillor asked  what was the meaning of all this mummery, and who that man was.    \"That's the Bishop of Zealand,\" was the answer.    \"Good Heavens! What has taken possession of the Bishop?\" sighed the  Councillor, shaking his head. It certainly could not be the Bishop; even  though he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom, and  people told the drollest anecdotes about him. Reflecting on the matter,  and without looking right or left, the Councillor went through East  Street and across the Habro-Platz. The bridge leading to Palace Square  was not to be found; scarcely trusting his senses, the nocturnal  wanderer discovered a shallow piece of water, and here fell in with two  men who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat.    \"Does your honor want to cross the ferry to the Holme?\" asked they.    \"Across to the Holme!\" said the Councillor, who knew nothing of the age  in which he at that moment was. \"No, I am going to Christianshafen, to  Little Market Street.\"    Both men stared at him in astonishment.    \"Only just tell me where the bridge is,\" said he. \"It is really  unpardonable that there are no lamps here; and it is as dirty as if one  had to wade through a morass.\"    The longer he spoke with the boatmen, the more unintelligible did their  language become to him.    \"I don't understand your Bornholmish dialect,\" said he at last, angrily,  and turning his back upon them. He was unable to find the bridge: there  was no railway either. \"It is really disgraceful what a state this place  is in,\" muttered he to himself. Never had his age, with which, however,  he was always grumbling, seemed so miserable as on this evening. \"I'll  take a hackney-coach!\" thought he. But where were the hackney-coaches?  Not one was to be seen.    \"I must go back to the New Market; there, it is to be hoped, I  shall find some coaches; for if I don't, I shall never get safe to  Christianshafen.\"    So off he went in the direction of East Street, and had nearly got to  the end of it when the moon shone forth.    \"God bless me! What wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up  there?\" cried he involuntarily, as he looked at East Gate, which, in  those days, was at the end of East Street.    He found, however, a little side-door open, and through this he went,  and stepped into our New Market of the present time. It was a huge  desolate plain; some wild bushes stood up here and there, while across  the"]]]
