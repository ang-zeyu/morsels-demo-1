[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#3)"],[1,"d. It is calm, sagacious, and, according to  the fashion of the age, slightly Machiavellian. But the first subject on  which Bacon exhibited his characteristic qualities, his appreciation of  facts, his balance of thought, and his power, when not personally  committed, of standing aloof from the ordinary prejudices and  assumptions of men round him, was the religious condition and prospects  of the English Church. Bacon had been brought up in a Puritan household  of the straitest sect. His mother was an earnest, severe, and intolerant  Calvinist, deep in the interests and cause of her party, bitterly  resenting all attempts to keep in order its pretensions. She was a  masterful woman, claiming to meddle with her brother-in-law's policy,  and though a most affectionate mother she was a woman of violent and  ungovernable temper. Her letters to her son Antony, whom she loved  passionately, but whom she suspected of keeping dangerous and papistical  company, show us the imperious spirit in which she claimed to interfere  with her sons; and they show also that in Francis she did not find all  the deference which she looked for. Recommending Antony to frequent \"the  religious exercises of the sincerer sort,\" she warns him not to follow  his brother's advice or example. Antony was advised to use prayer twice  a day with his servants. \"Your brother,\" she adds, \"is too negligent  therein.\" She is anxious about Antony's health, and warns him not to  fall into his brother's ill-ordered habits: \"I verily think your  brother's weak stomach to digest hath been much caused and confirmed by  untimely going to bed, and then musing _nescio quid_ when he should  sleep, and then in consequent by late rising and long lying in bed,  whereby his men are made slothful and himself continueth sickly. But my  sons haste not to hearken to their mother's good counsel in time to  prevent.\" It seems clear that Francis Bacon had shown his mother that  not only in the care of his health, but in his judgment on religious  matters, he meant to go his own way. Mr. Spedding thinks that she must  have had much influence on him; it seems more likely that he resented  her interference, and that the hard and narrow arrogance which she read  into the Gospel produced in him a strong reaction. Bacon was obsequious  to the tyranny of power, but he was never inclined to bow to the tyranny  of opinion; and the tyranny of Puritan infallibility was the last thing  to which he was likely to submit. His mother would have wished him to  sit under Cartwright and Travers. The friend of his choice was the  Anglican preacher, Dr. Andrewes, to whom he submitted all his works, and  whom he called his \"inquisitor general;\" and he was proud to sign  himself the pupil of Whitgift, and to write for him--the archbishop of  whom Lady Bacon wrote to her son Antony, veiling the dangerous sentiment  in Greek, \"that he was the ruin of the Church, for he loved his own  glory more than Christ's.\"    Certainly, in the remarkable paper on _Controversies in the Church_  (1589), Bacon had ceased to feel or to speak as a Puritan. The paper is  an attempt to compose the controversy by pointing out the mistakes in  judgment, in temper, and in method on both sides. It is entirely unlike  what a Puritan would have written: it is too moderate, too tolerant, too  neutral, though like most essays of conciliation it is open to the  rejoinder from both sides--certainly from the Puritan--that it begs the  question by assuming the unimportance of the matters about which each  contended with so much zeal. It is the confirmation, but also the  complement, and in some ways the correction of Hooker's contemporary  view of the quarrel which was threatening the life of the English  Church, and not even Hooker could be so comprehensive and so fair. For  Hooker had to defend much that was indefensible: he had to defend a  great traditional system, just convulsed by a most tremendous shock--a  shock and alteration, as Bacon says, \"the greatest and most dangerous  that can be in a State,\" in which old clews and habits and rules were  confused and all but lost; in which a frightful amount of personal  incapacity and worthlessness had, from sheer want of men, risen to the  high places of the Church; and in which force and violence, sometimes of  the most hateful kind, had come to be accepted as ordinary instruments  in the government of souls. Hooker felt too strongly the unfairness, the  folly, the intolerant aggressiveness, the malignity of his opponents--he  was too much alive to the wrongs inflicted by them on his own side, and  to the incredible absurdity of their arguments--to do justice to what  was only too real in the charges and complaints of those opponents. But  Bacon came from the very heart of the Puritan camp. He had seen the  inside of Puritanism--its best as well as its worst side. He witnesses  to the humility, the conscientiousness, the labour, the learning, the  hatred of sin and wrong, of many of its preachers. He had heard, and  heard with sympathy, all that could be urged against the bishops'  administration, and against a system of legal oppression in the name of  the Church. Where religious elements were so confusedly mixed, and where  each side had apparently so much to urge on behalf of its claims, he saw  the deep mistake of loftily ignoring facts, and of want of patience and  forbearance with those who were scandalised at abuses, while the abuses,  in some cases monstrous, were tolerated and turned to profit. Towards  the bishops and their policy, though his language is very respectful,  for the government was implicated, he is very severe. They punish and  restrain, but they do not themselves mend their ways or supply what was  wanting; and theirs are \"_injuriae potentiorum_\"--\"injuries come from  them that have the upperhand.\" But Hooker himself did not put his finger  more truly and more surely on the real mischief of the Puritan movement:  on the immense outbreak in it of unreasonable party spirit and visible  personal ambition--\"these are the true successors of Diotrephes and not  my lord bishops\"--on the gradual development of the Puritan theory till  it came at last to claim a supremacy as unquestionable and intolerant as  that of the Papacy; on the servile affectation of the fashions of Geneva  and Strasburg; on the poverty and foolishness of much of the Puritan  teaching--its inability to satisfy the great questions which it raised  in the soul, its unworthy dealing with Scripture--\"naked examples,  conceited inferences, and forced allusions, which mine into all  certainty of religion\"--\"the word, the bread of life, they toss up and  down, they break it not;\" on their undervaluing of moral worth, if it  did not speak in their phraseology--\"as they censure virtuous men by the  names of _civil_ and _moral_, so do they censure men truly and godly  wise, who see into the vanity of their assertions, by the name of  _politiques_, saying that their wisdom is but carnal and savouring of  man's brain.\" Bacon saw that the Puritans were aiming at a tyranny  which, if they established it, would be more comprehensive, more  searching, and more cruel than that of the older systems; but he thought  it a remote and improbable danger, and that they might safely be  tolerated for the work they did in education and preaching, \"because the  work of exhortation doth chiefly rest upon these men, and they have a  zeal and hate of sin.\" But he ends by warning them lest \"that be true  which one of their adversaries said, _that they have but two small  wants--knowledge and love_.\" One complaint that he makes of them is a  curious instance of the changes of feeling, or at least of language, on  moral subjects. He accuses them of \"having pronounced generally, and  without difference, all untruths unlawful,\" forgetful of the Egyptian  midwives, and Rahab, and Solomon, and even of Him \"who, the more to  touch the hearts of the disciples with a holy dalliance, made as though  he would have passed Emmaus.\" He is thinking of their failure to apply a  principle which was characteristic of his mode of thought, that even a  statement about a virtue like veracity \"hath limit as all things else  have;\" but it is odd to find Bacon bringing against the Puritans the  converse of the charge which his age, and Pascal afterwards, brought  against the Jesuits. The essay, besides being a picture of the times as  regards religion, is an example of what was to be Bacon's characteristic  strength and weakness: his strength in lifting up a subject which had  been degraded by mean and wrangling disputations, into a higher and  larger light, and bringing to bear on it great principles and the  results of the best human wisdom and experience, expressed in weighty  and pregnant maxims; his weakness in forgetting, as, in spite of his  philosophy, he so often did, that the grandest major premises need  well-proved and ascertained minors, and that the enunciation of a  principle is not the same thing as the application of it. Doubtless  there is truth in his closing words; but each party would have made the  comment that what he had to prove, and had not proved, was that by  following his counsel they would \"love the whole world better than a  part.\"         \"Let them not fear ... the fond calumny of _neutrality_; but let       them know that is true which is said by a wise man, _that neuters       in contentions are either better or worse than either side_. These       things have I in all sincerity and simplicity set down touching the       controversies which now trouble the Church of England; and that       without all art and insinuation, and therefore not like to be       grateful to either part. Notwithstanding, I trust what has been       said shall find a correspondence in their minds which are not       embarked in partiality, and which _love the whole letter than a       part_\"    Up to this time, though Bacon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#3)"],[1,"rest for justification. It is to be  seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond  dispute the attributes of statehood, which alone can demand the  recognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession, in short, of  the essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgents and the  conduct of the war by them according to the received code of war are  no less important factors toward the determination of the problem of  belligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle  upon the internal polity of the recognizing state.    The wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of  December 7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in  Cuba, and it may be wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous  conflict had for seven years wasted the neighboring island. During all  those years an utter disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and  of the just demands of humanity, which called forth expressions of  condemnation from the nations of Christendom, continued unabated.  Desolation and ruin pervaded that productive region, enormously  affecting the commerce of all commercial nations, but that of the United  States more than any other by reason of proximity and larger trade and  intercourse. At that juncture General Grant uttered these words, which  now, as then, sum up the elements of the problem:      A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,    impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself    is that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the    contest.      In a former message to Congress[3] I had occasion to consider this    question, and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba,    dreadful and devastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the    fearful dignity of war. * * * It is possible that the acts of foreign    powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of this very nature, might be    pointed to in defense of such recognition. But now, as in its past    history, the United States should carefully avoid the false lights    which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of questionable    propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule, which has been    its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and of good    report. The question of according or of withholding rights of    belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particular    attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and    justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration    of moral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is    required, when the interests and rights of another government or of    its people are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to    require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto. But    this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of    international law as war. Belligerence, too, is a fact. The mere    existence of contending armed bodies and their occasional conflicts do    not constitute war in the sense referred to. Applying to the existing    condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publicists and    writers on international law, and which have been observed by nations    of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive or selfish and    unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of    such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and    manifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary    functions of government toward its own people and to other states,    with courts for the administration of justice, with a local    habitation, possessing such organization of force, such material, such    occupation of territory, as to take the contest out of the category of    a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it    on the terrible footing of war, to which a recognition of belligerency    would aim to elevate it. The contest, moreover, is solely on land; the    insurrection has not possessed itself of a single seaport whence it    may send forth its flag, nor has it any means of communication with    foreign powers except through the military lines of its adversaries.    No apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complications    which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels,    both commercial and national, and upon the consular officers of other    powers calls for the definition of their relations to the parties to    the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard the    accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature    as I regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right.    Such recognition entails upon the country according the rights which    flow from it difficult and complicated duties, and requires the    exaction from the contending parties of the strict observance of their    rights and obligations. It confers the right of search upon the high    seas by vessels of both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms    and munitions of war, which now may be transported freely and without    interruption in the vessels of the United States, to detention and to    possible seizure; it would give rise to countless vexatious questions,    would release the parent Government from responsibility for acts done    by the insurgents, and would invest Spain with the right to exercise    the supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on    the high seas, a very large part of which, in its traffic between the    Atlantic and the Gulf States and between all of them and the States on    the Pacific, passes through the waters which wash the shores of Cuba.    The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead, if not to    abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful relations    of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such    supervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy    of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by    measures of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection.      Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency  and reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further  pertinent considerations appear. In the code of nations there is no  such thing as a naked recognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the  assumption of international neutrality. Such recognition, without more,  will not confer upon either party to a domestic conflict a status not  theretofore actually possessed or affect the relation of either party to  other states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemn  proclamation of neutrality, which recites the _de facto_ condition  of belligerency as its motive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality  in the declaring state. It assumes the international obligations of a  neutral in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens  and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate  those rigorous obligations at their own peril and can not expect to be  shielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on the  seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good  prize under admiralty law must under international law be admitted  as a legitimate consequence of a proclamation of belligerency. While  according the equal belligerent rights defined by public law to each  party in our ports disfavors would be imposed on both, which, while  nominally equal, would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain herself.  Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba, her maritime rights  could be asserted not only for the military investment of the island,  but up to the margin of our own territorial waters, and a condition of  things would exist for which the Cubans within their own domain could  not hope to create a parallel, while its creation through aid or  sympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now,  with the additional obligations of international neutrality we would  perforce assume.    The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would  only be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and  applicable by our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United  States no jurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give  the United States no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the  strife within the paramount authority of Spain according to the  international code of war.    For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the  Cuban insurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that  step hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the  Executive will take it.    Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and  has not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration.  But should such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful  change has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new  government has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged in  advance to the declaration that all the effort in the world can not  suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of  reform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that  with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system  of warfare for one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer  aim to drive the Cubans to the \"horrible alternative of taking to the  thicket or succumbing in misery;\" that reforms must be instituted in  accordance with the needs and circumstances of the time, and that these  reforms, while designed to give full autonomy to the colony and to  create a virtual entity and self-controlle"]]]
