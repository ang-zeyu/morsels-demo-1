If the performance be indifferent it is no  consolation for the audience to hear that the player acted well last  night, or to be told that he will act better to-morrow night; it is  this night that the public has to deal with, and the impression the  actor has made, good or bad, remains as such upon the mind of that  particular audience.    The author, painter, or musician, if he be dissatisfied with his work,  may alter and perfect it before giving it publicity, but an actor  cannot rub out; he ought, therefore, in justice to his audience, to be  sure of what he is going to place before it.  Should a picture in an  art gallery be carelessly painted we can pass on to another, or if a  book fails to please us we can put it down.  An escape from this kind  of dulness is easily made, but in a theatre the auditor is imprisoned.  If the acting be indifferent, he must endure it, at least for a time.  He cannot withdraw without making himself conspicuous; so he remains,  hoping that there may be some improvement as the play proceeds, or  perhaps from consideration for the company he is in.  It is this  helpless condition that renders careless acting so offensive.        PREPARATION AND INSPIRATION    I have seen impulsive actors who were so confident of their power that  they left all to chance.  This is a dangerous course, especially when  acting a new character.  I will admit that there are many instances  where great effects have been produced that were entirely spontaneous,  and were as much a surprise to the actors who made them as they were  to the audience who witnessed them; but just as individuals who have  exuberant spirits are at times dreadfully depressed, so when an  impulsive actor fails to receive his inspiration he is dull indeed,  and is the more disappointing because of his former brilliant  achievements.    In the stage management of a play, or in the acting of a part, nothing  should be left to chance, and for the reason that spontaneity,  inspiration, or whatever the strange and delightful quality may be  called, is not to be commanded, or we should give it some other name.  It is, therefore, better that a clear and unmistakable outline of a  character should be drawn before an actor undertakes a new part.  If  he has a well-ordered and an artistic mind it is likely that he will  give at least a symmetrical and effective performance; but should he  make no definite arrangement, and depend upon our ghostly friends  Spontaneity and Inspiration to pay him a visit, and should they  decline to call, the actor will be in a maze and his audience in a  muddle.    Besides, why not prepare to receive our mysterious friends whether  they come or not?  If they fail on such an invitation, we can at least  entertain our other guests without them, and if they do appear, our  preconceived arrangements will give them a better welcome and put them  more at ease.    Acting under these purely artificial conditions will necessarily be  cold, but the care with which the part is given will at least render  it inoffensive; they are, therefore, primary considerations, and not  to be despised.  The exhibition, however, of artistic care does not  alone constitute great acting.  The inspired warmth of passion in  tragedy and the sudden glow of humour in comedy cover the artificial  framework with an impenetrable veil: this is the very climax of great  art, for which there seems to be no other name but genius.  It is  then, and then only, that an audience feels that it is in the presence  of a reality rather than a fiction.  To an audience an ounce of genius  has more weight than a ton of talent; for though it respects the  latter, it reverences the former.  But the creative power, divine as  it may be, should in common gratitude pay due regard to the  reflective; for Art is the handmaid of Genius, and only asks the  modest wages of respectful consideration in payment for her valuable  services.  A splendid torrent of genius ought never to be checked, but  it should be wisely guided into the deep channel of the stream, from  whose surface it will then reflect Nature without a ripple.  Genius  dyes the hues that resemble those of the rainbow; Art fixes the  colours that they may stand.  In the race for fame purely artificial  actors cannot hope to win against those whose genius is guided by  their art; and, on the other hand, Intuition must not complain if,  unbridled or with too loose a rein, it stumbles on the course, and so  allows a well-ridden hack to distance it.        SHOULD AN ACTOR \"FEEL\" HIS PART    Much has been written upon the question as to whether an actor ought  to feel the character he acts, or be dead to any sensations in this  direction.  Excellent artists differ in their opinions on this  important point.  In discussing it I must refer to some words I wrote  in one of my early chapters:    \"The methods by which actors arrive at great effects vary according to  their own natures; this renders the teaching of the art by any  strictly defined lines a difficult matter.\"    There has lately been a discussion on the subject, in which many have  taken part, and one quite notable debate between two distinguished  actors, one of the English and the other of the French stage [Henry  Irving and Mons. Coquelin].  These gentlemen, though they differ  entirely in their ideas, are, nevertheless, equally right.  The method  of one, I have no doubt, is the best he could possibly devise for  himself; and the same may be said of the rules of the other as applied  to himself.  But they must work with their own tools; if they had to  adopt each other's they would be as much confused as if compelled to  exchange languages.  One believes that he must feel the character he  plays, even to the shedding of real tears, while the other prefers  never to lose himself for an instant, and there is no doubt that they  both act with more effect by adhering to their own dogmas.    For myself, I know that I act best when the heart is warm and the head  is cool.  In observing the works of great painters I find that they  have no conventionalities except their own; hence they are masters,  and each is at the head of his own school.  They are original, and  could not imitate even if they would.    So with acting, no master-hand can prescribe rules for the head of  another school.  If, then, I appear bold in putting forth my  suggestions, I desire it to be clearly understood that I do not  present them to original or experienced artists who have formed their  school, but to the student who may have a temperament akin to my own,  and who could, therefore, blend my methods with his preconceived  ideas.    Many instructors in the dramatic art fall into the error of teaching  too much.  The pupil should first be allowed to exhibit his quality,  and so teach the teacher what to teach.  This course would answer the  double purpose of first revealing how much the pupil is capable of  learning, and, what is still more important, of permitting him to  display his powers untrammeled.  Whereas, if the master begins by  pounding his dogmas into the student, the latter becomes environed by  a foreign influence which, if repugnant to his nature, may smother his  ability.    It is necessary to be cautious in studying elocution and  gesticulation, lest they become our masters instead of our servants.  These necessary but dangerous ingredients must be administered and  taken in homeopathic doses, or the patient may die by being  over-stimulated.  But, even at the risk of being artificial, it is  better to have studied these arbitrary rules than to enter a  profession with no knowledge whatever of its mechanism.  Dramatic  instinct is so implanted in humanity that it sometimes misleads us,  fostering the idea that because we have the natural talent within we  are equally endowed with the power of bringing it out.  This is the  common error, the rock on which the histrionic aspirant is oftenest  wrecked.  Very few actors succeed who crawl into the service through  the \"cabin windows\"; and if they do it is a lifelong regret with them  that they did not exert their courage and sail at first \"before the  mast.\"    Many of the shining lights who now occupy the highest positions on the  stage, and whom the public voice delights to praise, have often  appeared in the dreaded character of omnes, marched in processions,  sung out of tune in choruses, and shouted themselves hoarse for Brutus  and Mark Antony.    If necessity is the mother of invention, she is the foster-mother of  art, for the greatest actors that ever lived have drawn their early  nourishment from her breast.  We learn our profession by the  mortifications we are compelled to go through in order to get a  living.    The sons and daughters of wealthy parents who have money at their  command, and can settle their weekly expenses without the assistance  of the box office, indignantly refuse to lower themselves by assuming  some subordinate character for which they are cast, and march home  because their fathers and mothers will take care of them.  Well, they  had better stay there!    But whether you are rich or poor, if you would be an actor begin at  the beginning.  This is the old conventional advice, and is as good  now in its old age as it was in its youth.  All actors will agree in  this, and as Puff says, in the _Critic_, \"When they do agree on the  stage the unanimity is wonderful.\"  Enroll yourself as a \"super\" in  some first-class theatre, where there is a stock Company and likely to  be a periodical change of programme, so that even in your low degree  the practice will be varied.  After having posed a month as an  innocent English rustic, you may, in the next play, have an  opportunity of being a noble Roman.

From Kibize islet to Kabogo River on east side of Lake ten hours; sleep  there. Syde slipped past us at night, but we made up to him in four  hours next morning.    _13th March, 1869._--At Rombole; we sleep, then on.    [At last he reached the great Arab settlement at Ujiji, on the eastern  shore of Tanganyika. It was his first visit, but he had arranged that  supplies should be forwarded thither by caravans bound inland from  Zanzibar. Most unfortunately his goods were made away with in all  directions--not only on this, but on several other occasions. The  disappointment to a man shattered in health, and craving for letters and  stores, must have been severe indeed.]    _14th March, 1869._--Go past Malagarasi River, and reach Ujiji in 3-1/2  hours. Found Haji Thani's agent in charge of my remaining goods.  Medicines, wine, and cheese had been left at Unyanyembe, thirteen days  east of this. Milk not to be had, as the cows had not calved, but a  present of Assam tea from Mr. Black, the Inspector of the Peninsular and  Oriental Company's affairs, had come from Calcutta, besides my own  coffee and a little sugar. I bought butter; two large pots are sold for  two fathoms of blue calico, and four-year-old flour, with which we made  bread. I found great benefit from the tea and coffee, and still more  from flannel to the skin.    _15th March, 1869._--Took account of all the goods left by the  plunderer; sixty-two out of eighty pieces of cloth (each of twenty-four  yards) were stolen, and most of my best beads. The road to Unyembe[3] is  blocked up by a Mazitu or Watuta war, so I must wait till the Governor  there gets an opportunity to send them. The Musa sent with the buffaloes  is a genuine specimen of the ill-conditioned, English-hating Arab. I was  accosted on arriving by, \"You must give me five dollars a month for all  my time;\" this though he had brought nothing--the buffaloes all  died--and did nothing but receive stolen goods. I tried to make use of  him to go a mile every second day for milk, but he shammed sickness so  often on that day I had to get another to go; then he made a regular  practice of coming into my house, watching what my two attendants were  doing, and going about the village with distorted statements against  them.    I clothed him, but he tried to make bad blood between the respectable  Arab who supplied me with milk and myself, telling him that I abused  him, and then he would come back, saying that he abused me! I can  account for his conduct only by attributing it to that which we call  ill-conditioned: I had to expel him from the house.    I repaired a house to keep out the rain, and on the _23rd_ moved into  it. I gave our Kasanga host a cloth and blanket; he is ill of pneumonia  of both lungs.    _28th March, 1869._--Flannel to the skin and tea very beneficial in the  cure of my disease; my cough has ceased, and I walk half a mile. I am  writing letters for home.    _8th April, 1869._--Visited Moene Mokaia, who sent me two fowls and  rice; gave him two cloths. He added a sheep.    _13th April, 1869._--Employed Suleyman to write notes to Governor of  Unyembe, Syde bin Salem Burashid, to make inquiries about the theft of  my goods, as I meant to apply to Syed Majid, and wished to speak truly  about his man Musa bin Salum, the chief depredator.    Wrote also to Thani for boat and crew to go down Tanganyika.    Syde bin Habib refused to allow his men to carry my letters to the  coast; as he suspected that I would write about his doings in Rua.    _27th April, 1869._--Syde had three canoes smashed in coming up past  Thembwe; the wind and waves drove them on the rocks, and two were  totally destroyed: they are heavy unmanageable craft, and at the mercy  of any storm if they cannot get into a shut bay, behind the reeds and  aquatic vegetation. One of the wrecks is said to have been worth 200  dollars (40_l._).    The season called Masika commenced this month with the usual rolling  thunder, and more rain than in the month preceding.    I have been busy writing letters home, and finished forty-two, which in  some measure will make up for my long silence. The Ujijians are  unwilling to carry my letters, because, they say, Seyed Majid will order  the bearer to return with others: he may say, \"You know where he is, go  back to him,\" but I suspect they fear my exposure of their ways more  than anything else.[4]    _16th May, 1869._--Thani bin Suellim sent me a note yesterday to say  that he would be here in two days, or say three; he seems the most  active of the Ujijians, and I trust will help me to get a canoe and men.    The malachite at Katanga is loosened by fire, then dug out of four  hills: four manehs of the ore yield one maneh of copper, but those who  cultivate the soil get more wealth than those who mine the copper.    [No change of purpose was allowed to grow out of sickness and  disappointment. Here and there, as in the words written on the next day,  we find Livingstone again with his back turned to the coast and gazing  towards the land of the Manyuema and the great rivers reported there.]  _17th May, 1869._--Syde bin Habib arrived to-day with his cargo of  copper and slaves. I have to change house again, and wish I were away,  now that I am getting stronger. Attendants arrive from Parra or Mparra.    [The old slave-dealer, whom he met at Casembe's, and who seems to have  been set at liberty through Livingstone's instrumentality, arrives at  Ujiji at last.]    _18th May, 1869._--Mohamad bin Saleh arrived to-day. He left this when  comparatively young, and is now well advanced in years.    The Bakatala at Lualaba West killed Salem bin Habib. _Mem._--Keep clear  of them. Makwamba is one of the chiefs of the rock-dwellers, Ngulu is  another, and Masika-Kitobwe on to Baluba. Sef attached Kilolo N'tambwe.    _19th May, 1869._--The emancipation of our West-Indian slaves was the  work of but a small number of the people of England--the philanthropists  and all the more advanced thinkers of the age. Numerically they were a  very small minority of the population, and powerful only from the  superior abilities of the leading men, and from having the right, the  true, and just on their side. Of the rest of the population an immense  number were the indifferent, who had no sympathies to spare for any  beyond their own fireside circles. In the course of time sensation  writers came up on the surface of society, and by way of originality  they condemned almost every measure and person of the past.  \"Emancipation was a mistake;\" and these fast writers drew along with  them a large body, who would fain be slaveholders themselves. We must  never lose sight of the fact that though the majority perhaps are on the  side of freedom, large numbers of Englishmen are not slaveholders only  because the law forbids the practice. In this proclivity we see a great  part of the reason of the frantic sympathy of thousands with the rebels  in the great Black war in America. It is true that we do sympathize  with brave men, though we may not approve of the objects for which they  fight. We admired Stonewall Jackson as a modern type of Cromwell's  Ironsides; and we praised Lee for his generalship, which, after all, was  chiefly conspicuous by the absence of commanding abilities in his  opponents, but, unquestionably, there existed besides an eager desire  that slaveocracy might prosper, and the Negro go to the wall. The  would-be slaveholders showed their leanings unmistakably in reference to  the Jamaica outbreak; and many a would-be Colonel Hobbs, in lack of  revolvers, dipped his pen in gall and railed against all Niggers who  could not be made slaves. We wonder what they thought of their hero,  when informed that, for very shame at what he had done and written, he  had rushed unbidden out of the world.    _26th May, 1869._--Thani bin Suellim came from Unyanyembe on the 20th.  He is a slave who has risen to freedom and influence; he has a  disagreeable outward squint of the right eye, teeth protruding from the  averted lips, is light-coloured, and of the nervous type of African. He  brought two light boxes from Unyembe, and charged six fathoms for one  and eight fathoms for the other, though the carriage of both had been  paid for at Zanzibar. When I paid him he tried to steal, and succeeded  with one cloth by slipping it into the hands of a slave. I gave him two  cloths and a double blanket as a present. He discovered afterwards what  he knew before, that all had been injured by the wet on the way here,  and sent two back openly, which all saw to be an insult. He asked a  little coffee, and I gave a plateful; and he even sent again for more  coffee after I had seen reason to resent his sending back my present. I  replied, \"He won't send coffee back, for I shall give him none.\" In  revenge he sends round to warn all the Ujijians against taking my  letters to the coast; this is in accordance with their previous conduct,  for, like the Kilwa people on the road to Nyassa, they have refused to  carry my correspondence.    This is a den of the worst kind of slave-traders; those whom I met in  Urungu and Itawa were gentlemen slavers: the Ujiji slavers, like the  Kilwa and Portuguese, are the vilest of the vile. It is not a trade, but  a system of consecutive murders; they go to plunder and kidnap, and  every trading trip is nothing but a foray. Moene Mokaia, the headman of  this place, sent canoes through to Nzige, and his people, feeling their  prowess among men ignorant of guns, made a regular assault but were  repulsed, and the whole, twenty in number, were"]]]
