A big washhand basin of  very brown fruit-salad, buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of  something the lady-help called \"Limonadear.\" And you went away in the  evening with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled all  down the front of your open-work pinafore, leaving the Samuel Josephs  leaping like savages on their lawn. No! They were too awful.    On the other side of the beach, close down to the water, two little  boys, their knickers rolled up, twinkled like spiders. One was digging,  the other pattered in and out of the water, filling a small bucket. They  were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags. But Pip was so busy digging and Rags  was so busy helping that they didn't see their little cousins until they  were quite close.    \"Look!\" said Pip. \"Look what I've discovered.\" And he showed them an old  wet, squashed-looking boot. The three little girls stared.    \"Whatever are you going to do with it?\" asked Kezia.    \"Keep it, of course!\" Pip was very scornful. \"It's a find--see?\"    Yes, Kezia saw that. All the same....    \"There's lots of things buried in the sand,\" explained Pip. \"They get  chucked up from wrecks. Treasure. Why--you might find--\"    \"But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in?\" asked Lottie.    \"Oh, that's to moisten it,\" said Pip, \"to make the work a bit easier.  Keep it up, Rags.\"    And good little Rags ran up and down, pouring in the water that turned  brown like cocoa.    \"Here, shall I show you what I found yesterday?\" said Pip mysteriously,  and he stuck his spade into the sand. \"Promise not to tell.\"    They promised.    \"Say, cross my heart straight dinkum.\"    The little girls said it.    Pip took something out of his pocket, rubbed it a long time on the front  of his jersey, then breathed on it and rubbed it again.    \"Now turn round!\" he ordered.    They turned round.    \"All look the same way! Keep still! Now!\"    And his hand opened; he held up to the light something that flashed,  that winked, that was a most lovely green.    \"It's a nemeral,\" said Pip solemnly.    \"Is it really, Pip?\" Even Isabel was impressed.    The lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pip's fingers. Aunt Beryl had  a nemeral in a ring, but it was a very small one. This one was as big as  a star and far more beautiful.      Chapter 1.V.    As the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sand-hills  and came down on the beach to bathe. It was understood that at eleven  o'clock the women and children of the summer colony had the sea to  themselves. First the women undressed, pulled on their bathing dresses  and covered their heads in hideous caps like sponge bags; then the  children were unbuttoned. The beach was strewn with little heaps of  clothes and shoes; the big summer hats, with stones on them to keep them  from blowing away, looked like immense shells. It was strange that even  the sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping, laughing  figures ran into the waves. Old Mrs. Fairfield, in a lilac cotton dress  and a black hat tied under the chin, gathered her little brood and got  them ready. The little Trout boys whipped their shirts over their heads,  and away the five sped, while their grandma sat with one hand in her  knitting-bag ready to draw out the ball of wool when she was satisfied  they were safely in.    The firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender,  delicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering, crouching down,  slapping the water, never hesitated. But Isabel, who could swim twelve  strokes, and Kezia, who could nearly swim eight, only followed on the  strict understanding they were not to be splashed. As for Lottie, she  didn't follow at all. She liked to be left to go in her own way,  please. And that way was to sit down at the edge of the water, her legs  straight, her knees pressed together, and to make vague motions with her  arms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea. But when a bigger wave  than usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in her direction,  she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up the beach  again.    \"Here, mother, keep those for me, will you?\"    Two rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfield's lap.    \"Yes, dear. But aren't you going to bathe here?\"    \"No-o,\" Beryl drawled. She sounded vague. \"I'm undressing farther along.  I'm going to bathe with Mrs. Harry Kember.\"    \"Very well.\" But Mrs. Fairfield's lips set. She disapproved of Mrs Harry  Kember. Beryl knew it.    Poor old mother, she smiled, as she skimmed over the stones. Poor old  mother! Old! Oh, what joy, what bliss it was to be young....    \"You look very pleased,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. She sat hunched up on  the stones, her arms round her knees, smoking.    \"It's such a lovely day,\" said Beryl, smiling down at her.    \"Oh my dear!\" Mrs. Harry Kember's voice sounded as though she knew  better than that. But then her voice always sounded as though she  knew something better about you than you did yourself. She was a long,  strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. Her face, too, was  long and narrow and exhausted-looking; even her fair curled fringe  looked burnt out and withered. She was the only woman at the Bay who  smoked, and she smoked incessantly, keeping the cigarette between her  lips while she talked, and only taking it out when the ash was so long  you could not understand why it did not fall. When she was not playing  bridge--she played bridge every day of her life--she spent her time  lying in the full glare of the sun. She could stand any amount of  it; she never had enough. All the same, it did not seem to warm her.  Parched, withered, cold, she lay stretched on the stones like a piece  of tossed-up driftwood. The women at the Bay thought she was very, very  fast. Her lack of vanity, her slang, the way she treated men as though  she was one of them, and the fact that she didn't care twopence about  her house and called the servant Gladys \"Glad-eyes,\" was disgraceful.  Standing on the veranda steps Mrs. Kember would call in her indifferent,  tired voice, \"I say, Glad-eyes, you might heave me a handkerchief if  I've got one, will you?\" And Glad-eyes, a red bow in her hair instead of  a cap, and white shoes, came running with an impudent smile. It was an  absolute scandal! True, she had no children, and her husband... Here the  voices were always raised; they became fervent. How can he have married  her? How can he, how can he? It must have been money, of course, but  even then!    Mrs. Kember's husband was at least ten years younger than she was, and  so incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect  illustration in an American novel rather than a man. Black hair, dark  blue eyes, red lips, a slow sleepy smile, a fine tennis player, a  perfect dancer, and with it all a mystery. Harry Kember was like a man  walking in his sleep. Men couldn't stand him, they couldn't get a word  out of the chap; he ignored his wife just as she ignored him. How did  he live? Of course there were stories, but such stories! They simply  couldn't be told. The women he'd been seen with, the places he'd been  seen in... but nothing was ever certain, nothing definite. Some of the  women at the Bay privately thought he'd commit a murder one day. Yes,  even while they talked to Mrs. Kember and took in the awful concoction  she was wearing, they saw her, stretched as she lay on the beach; but  cold, bloody, and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her  mouth.    Mrs. Kember rose, yawned, unsnapped her belt buckle, and tugged at the  tape of her blouse. And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her  jersey, and stood up in her short white petticoat, and her camisole with  ribbon bows on the shoulders.    \"Mercy on us,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember, \"what a little beauty you are!\"    \"Don't!\" said Beryl softly; but, drawing off one stocking and then the  other, she felt a little beauty.    \"My dear--why not?\" said Mrs. Harry Kember, stamping on her own  petticoat. Really--her underclothes! A pair of blue cotton knickers and  a linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillow-case... \"And you  don't wear stays, do you?\" She touched Beryl's waist, and Beryl sprang  away with a small affected cry. Then \"Never!\" she said firmly.    \"Lucky little creature,\" sighed Mrs. Kember, unfastening her own.    Beryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one  who is trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathing-dress  all at one and the same time.    \"Oh, my dear--don't mind me,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. \"Why be shy? I  shan't eat you. I shan't be shocked like those other ninnies.\" And she  gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.    But Beryl was shy. She never undressed in front of anybody. Was that  silly? Mrs. Harry Kember made her feel it was silly, even something  to be ashamed of. Why be shy indeed! She glanced quickly at her friend  standing so boldly in her torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette;  and a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast. Laughing  recklessly, she drew on the limp, sandy-feeling bathing-dress that was  not quite dry and fastened the twisted buttons.    \"That's better,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. They began to go down the  beach together. \"Really, it's a sin for you to wear clothes, my dear.  Somebody's got to tell you some day.\"    The water was quite warm. It was that marvellous transparent blue,  flecked with silver, but the sand at the bottom looked gold; when you  kicked with your toes there rose a little puff of gold-dust. Now the  waves just reached her breast. Beryl stood, her arms outstretched,  gazing out, and as each wave came she gave the slightest little jump, so  that it seemed it was the wave which lifted her so gently.    \"I believe in pretty girls having a good time,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#3)"],[1," first great  expansion of Greek knowledge about the world began, through the  extensive colonisation which was carried on by the Greeks around  the Eastern Mediterranean. Even to this day the natives of the  southern part of Italy speak a Greek dialect, owing to the wide  extent of Greek colonies in that country, which used to be called  \"Magna Grecia,\" or \"Great Greece.\" Marseilles also one of the Greek  colonies (600 B.C.), which, in its turn, sent out other colonies  along the Gulf of Lyons. In the East, too, Greek cities were dotted  along the coast of the Black Sea, one of which, Byzantium, was  destined to be of world-historic importance. So, too, in North  Africa, and among the islands of the AEgean Sea, the Greeks colonised  throughout the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and in almost every  case communication was kept up between the colonies and the  mother-country.    Now, the one quality which has made the Greeks so distinguished  in the world's history was their curiosity; and it was natural  that they should desire to know, and to put on record, the large  amount of information brought to the mainland of Greece from the  innumerable Greek colonies. But to record geographical knowledge,  the first thing that is necessary is a map, and accordingly it is  a Greek philosopher named ANAXIMANDER of Miletus, of the sixth  century B.C., to whom we owe the invention of map-drawing. Now,  in order to make a map of one's own country, little astronomical  knowledge is required. As we have seen, savages are able to draw  such maps; but when it comes to describing the relative positions  of countries divided from one another by seas, the problem is not  so easy. An Athenian would know roughly that Byzantium (now called  Constantinople) was somewhat to the east and to the north of him,  because in sailing thither he would have to sail towards the rising  sun, and would find the climate getting colder as he approached  Byzantium. So, too, he might roughly guess that Marseilles was  somewhere to the west and north of him; but how was he to fix the  relative position of Marseilles and Byzantium to one another? Was  Marseilles more northerly than Byzantium? Was it very far away  from that city? For though it took longer to get to Marseilles,  the voyage was winding, and might possibly bring the vessel  comparatively near to Byzantium, though there might be no direct  road between the two cities. There was one rough way of determining  how far north a place stood: the very slightest observation of the  starry heavens would show a traveller that as he moved towards  the north, the pole-star rose higher up in the heavens. How much  higher, could be determined by the angle formed by a stick pointing  to the pole-star, in relation to one held horizontally. If, instead  of two sticks, we cut out a piece of metal or wood to fill up the  enclosed angle, we get the earliest form of the sun-dial, known as  the _gnomon_, and according to the shape of the gnomon the latitude  of a place is determined. Accordingly, it is not surprising to find  that the invention of the gnomon is also attributed to Anaximander,  for without some such instrument it would have been impossible for  him to have made any map worthy of the name. But it is probable  that Anaximander did not so much invent as introduce the gnomon,  and, indeed, Herodotus, expressly states that this instrument was  derived from the Babylonians, who were the earliest astronomers, so  far as we know. A curious point confirms this, for the measurement  of angles is by degrees, and degrees are divided into sixty seconds,  just as minutes are. Now this division into sixty is certainly  derived from Babylonia in the case of time measurement, and is  therefore of the same origin as regards the measurement of angles.    We have no longer any copy of this first map of the world drawn  up by Anaximander, but there is little doubt that it formed the  foundation of a similar map drawn by a fellow-townsman of Anaximander,  HECATAEUS of Miletus, who seems to have written the first formal  geography. Only fragments of this are extant, but from them we are  able to see that it was of the nature of a _periplus_, or seaman's  guide, telling how many days' sail it was from one point to another,  and in what direction. We know also that he arranged his whole  subject into two books, dealing respectively with Europe and Asia,  under which latter term he included part of what we now know as  Africa. From the fragments scholars have been able to reproduce  the rough outlines of the map of the world as it presented itself  to Hecataeus. From this it can be seen that the Homeric conception of  the surrounding ocean formed a chief determining feature in Hecataeus's  map. For the rest, he was acquainted with the Mediterranean, Red,  and Black Seas, and with the great rivers Danube, Nile, Euphrates,  Tigris, and Indus.    The next great name in the history of Greek geography is that of  HERODOTUS of Halicarnassus, who might indeed be equally well called  the Father of Geography as the Father of History. He travelled  much in Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, and on the shores of the Black  Sea, while he was acquainted with Greece, and passed the latter  years of his life in South Italy. On all these countries he gave  his fellow-citizens accurate and tolerably full information, and  he had diligently collected knowledge about countries in their  neighbourhood. In particular he gives full details of Scythia (or  Southern Russia), and of the satrapies and royal roads of Persia.  As a rule, his information is as accurate as could be expected at  such an early date, and he rarely tells marvellous stories, or if  he does, he points out himself their untrustworthiness. Almost the  only traveller's yarn which Herodotus reports without due scepticism  is that of the ants of India that were bigger than foxes and burrowed  out gold dust for their ant-hills.    One of the stories he relates is of interest, as seeming to show  an anticipation of one of Mr. Stanley's journeys. Five young men  of the Nasamonians started from Southern Libya, W. of the Soudan,  and journeyed for many days west till they came to a grove of trees,  when they were seized by a number of men of very small stature, and  conducted through marshes to a great city of black men of the same  size, through which a large river flowed. This Herodotus identifies  with the Nile, but, from the indication of the journey given by  him, it would seem more probable that it was the Niger, and that  the Nasamonians had visited Timbuctoo! Owing to this statement  of Herodotus, it was for long thought that the Upper Nile flowed  east and west.    After Herodotus, the date of whose history may be fixed at the  easily remembered number of 444 B.C., a large increase of knowledge  was obtained of the western part of Asia by the two expeditions of  Xenophon and of Alexander, which brought the familiar knowledge of  the Greeks as far as India. But besides these military expeditions  we have still extant several log-books of mariners, which might  have added considerably to Greek geography. One of these tells  the tale of an expedition of the Carthaginian admiral named Hanno,  down the western coast of Africa, as far as Sierra Leone, a voyage  which was not afterwards undertaken for sixteen hundred years.  Hanno brought back from this voyage hairy skins, which, he stated,  belonged to men and women whom he had captured, and who were known  to the natives by the name of Gorillas. Another log-book is that  of a Greek named Scylax, who gives the sailing distances between  nearly all ports on the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and the number  of days required to pass from one to another. From this it would seem  that a Greek merchant vessel could manage on the average fifty miles  a day. Besides this, one of Alexander's admirals, named Nearchus,  learned to carry his ships from the mouth of the Indus to the Arabian  Gulf. Later on, a Greek sailor, Hippalus, found out that by using  the monsoons at the appropriate times, he could sail direct from  Arabia to India without laboriously coasting along the shores of  Persia and Beluchistan, and in consequence the Greeks gave his  name to the monsoon. For information about India itself, the Greeks  were, for a long time, dependent upon the account of Megasthenes,  an ambassador sent by Seleucus, one of Alexander's generals, to  the Indian king of the Punjab.    While knowledge was thus gained of the East, additional information  was obtained about the north of Europe by the travels of one PYTHEAS,  a native of Marseilles, who flourished about the time of Alexander  the Great (333 B.C.), and he is especially interesting to us as  having been the first civilised person who can be identified as  having visited Britain. He seems to have coasted along the Bay  of Biscay, to have spent some time in England,--which he reckoned  as 40,000 stadia (4000 miles) in circumference,--and he appears  also to have coasted along Belgium and Holland, as far as the mouth  of the Elbe. Pytheas is, however, chiefly known in the history  of geography as having referred to the island of Thule, which he  described as the most northerly point of the inhabited earth, beyond  which the sea became thickened, and of a jelly-like consistency. He  does not profess to have visited Thule, and his account probably  refers to the existence of drift ice near the Shetlands.    All this new information was gathered together, and made accessible  to the Greek reading world, by ERATOSTHENES, librarian of Alexandria  (240-196 B.C.), who was practically the founder of scientific geography.  He was the first to attempt any accurate measurement of the size of  the earth, and of its inhabited portion. By his time the scientific  men of Greece had become quite aware of the fact that the earth  was a globe, though they considered that it was fixed in space  at the centre of"]]]
