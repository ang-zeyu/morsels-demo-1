[Illustration]        There was an old man in a tree,      Whose whiskers were lovely to see;      But the birds of the air pluck'd them perfectly bare,      To make themselves nests in that tree.

[Illustration]        There was an old man of Boulak,      Who sate on a Crocodile's back;      But they said, \"Towr'ds the night he may probably bite,      Which might vex you, old man of Boulak!\"    [Illustration]        There was an old person of Skye,      Who waltz'd with a Bluebottle fly:      They buzz'd a sweet tune, to the light of the moon,      And entranced all the people of Skye.

Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'      So the Ducky and the leetle      Browny-Mousy, and the Beetle      Dined, and danced upon their heads,      Till they toddled to their beds.\"    \"The Story of the Four little Children who went Round the World\" follows  next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while  on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate  persons who have not perused the original: \"During the day-time Violet  chiefly occupied herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while her  three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter,  which it seldom if ever did.\" After journeying for a time, they saw some  land at a distance, \"and when they came to it they found it was an island  made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that it was bordered by  evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-Stream running about all over it, so  that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five  hundred and three feet high.\" In a later passage, we read how \"by-and-by  the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an  incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a  dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. Each of these blue bottles  contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live  continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in  many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found.\"  Our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the  description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object  which \"on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection,  seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of  sponge-cake and oyster-shells.\" This turned out to be the \"Co-operative  Cauliflower,\" who, \"while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him  with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly arose, and in a somewhat  plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps  supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers ... till he finally  disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific  sand. So remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very  deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of  undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.\"    In his third book, Mr. Lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to  repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of  \"Nonsense pure and absolute\" in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a  delightful anecdote illustrative of the \"persistently absurd report\" that  the Earl of Derby was the author of the first book of \"Nonsense.\" In this  volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original  efforts, and with little falling off. It is to be remarked that the third  division is styled \"Twenty-Six Nonsense Rhymes and Pictures,\" although  there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. Our favorite  illustrations are those of the \"Scroobious Snake who always wore a Hat on  his Head, for fear he should bite anybody,\" and the \"Visibly Vicious  Vulture who wrote some Verses to a Veal-cutlet in a Volume bound in  Vellum.\" In the fourth and last of Mr. Lear's books, we meet not only with  familiar words, but personages and places,--old friends like the Jumblies,  the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo, the Quangle Wangle, the hills of the Chankly Bore,  and the great Gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the Dong  with a luminous Nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love  of Nausicaa for Ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. In these verses,  graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile  us into feeling a real interest in Mr. Lear's absurd creations. So again in  the Pelican chorus there are some charming lines:--        \"By day we fish, and at eve we stand      On long bare islands of yellow sand.      And when the sun sinks slowly down,      And the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,      When the purple river rolls fast and dim,      And the ivory Ibis starlike skim,      Wing to wing we dance around,\" etc.    The other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further  quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following  set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in Mr.  Lear's books has drawn up for us:--      1. What do you gather from a study of Mr. Lear's works to       have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of       Gretna, Prague, Thermopylae, Wick, and Hong Kong?      2. State briefly what historical events are connected with       Ischia, Chertsey, Whitehaven, Boulak, and Jellibolee.      3. Comment, with illustrations, upon Mr. Lear's use of the       following words: Runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,       fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.      4. Enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the       Quangle Wangle's Hat, and explain how the Quangle Wangle       was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions       as to the true nature of the Co-operative Cauliflower.      5. What were the names of the five daughters of the Old       Person of China, and what was the purpose for which the       Old Man of the Dargle purchased six barrels of Gargle?      6. Collect notices of King Xerxes in Mr. Lear's works, and       state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and       appearance of Nupiter Piffkin.      7. Draw pictures of the Plum-pudding flea, and the Moppsikon       Floppsikon Bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs       were first used.      8.         \"There was an old man at a station                 Who made a promiscuous oration.\"         What bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have       upon Mr. Lear's political views?                                     --_The London Spectator_.                 *        *        *        *        *      A BOOK OF NONSENSE    by    EDWARD LEAR.

[Illustration]        There was an Old Man in a tree,      Who was horribly bored by a Bee;      When they said, \"Does it buzz?\" he replied, \"Yes, it does!      It's a regular brute of a Bee.\"        [Illustration]        There was an Old Lady of Chertsey,      Who made a remarkable curtsey;      She twirled round and round, till she sank underground,      Which distressed all the people of Chertsey.        [Illustration]        There was a Young Lady whose chin      Resembled the point of a pin;      So she had it made sharp, and purchased a harp,      And played several tunes with her chin.        [Illustration]        There was an Old Man with a flute,--      A \"sarpint\" ran into his boot!      But he played day and night, till the \"sarpint\" took flight,      And avoided that Man with a flute.        [Illustration]        There was a Young Lady of Portugal,      Whose ideas were excessively nautical;      She climbed up a tree to examine the sea,      But declared she would never leave Portugal.
