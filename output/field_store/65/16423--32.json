Mr. Stewart is going to put up my house for me in pay for my extra  work.    I am ashamed of my long letters to you, but I am such a murderer of  language that I have to use it all to tell anything.    Please don't entirely forget me. Your letters mean so much to me and I  will try to answer more promptly.          IV    A CHARMING ADVENTURE AND ZEBULON PIKE           _September 28, 1909._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    Your second card just reached me and I am plumb glad because, although  I answered your other, I was wishing I could write you, for I have had  the most charming adventure.    It is the custom here for as many women as care to to go in a party  over into Utah to Ashland (which is over a hundred miles away) after  fruit. They usually go in September, and it takes a week to make the  trip. They take wagons and camp out and of course have a good time,  but, the greater part of the way, there isn't even the semblance of a  road and it is merely a semblance anywhere. They came over to invite me  to join them. I was of two minds--I wanted to go, but it seemed a  little risky and a big chance for discomfort, since we would have to  cross the Uinta Mountains, and a snowstorm likely any time. But I  didn't like to refuse outright, so we left it to Mr. Stewart. His  \"Ye're nae gang\" sounded powerful final, so the ladies departed in awed  silence and I assumed a martyr-like air and acted like a very much  abused woman, although he did only what I wanted him to do. At last, in  sheer desperation he told me the \"bairn canna stand the treep,\" and  that was why he was so determined. I knew why, of course, but I  continued to look abused lest he gets it into his head that he can boss  me. After he had been reduced to the proper plane of humility and had  explained and begged my pardon and had told me to consult only my own  pleasure about going and coming and using his horses, only not to  \"expoose\" the bairn, why, I forgave him and we were friends once more.    Next day all the men left for the roundup, to be gone a week. I knew I  never could stand myself a whole week. In a little while the ladies  came past on their way to Ashland. They were all laughing and were so  happy that I really began to wish I was one of the number, but they  went their way and I kept wanting to go _somewhere_. I got reckless and  determined to do something real bad. So I went down to the barn and  saddled Robin Adair, placed a pack on \"Jeems McGregor,\" then Jerrine  and I left for a camping-out expedition.    It was nine o'clock when we started and we rode hard until about four,  when I turned Robin loose, saddle and all, for I knew he would go home  and some one would see him and put him into the pasture. We had gotten  to where we couldn't ride anyway, so I put Jerrine on the pack and led  \"Jeems\" for about two hours longer; then, as I had come to a good place  to camp, we stopped.    While we had at least two good hours of daylight, it gets so cold here  in the evening that fire is very necessary. We had been climbing higher  into the mountains all day and had reached a level tableland where the  grass was luxuriant and there was plenty of wood and water. I unpacked  \"Jeems\" and staked him out, built a roaring fire, and made our bed in  an angle of a sheer wall of rock where we would be protected against  the wind. Then I put some potatoes into the embers, as Baby and I are  both fond of roasted potatoes. I started to a little spring to get  water for my coffee when I saw a couple of jack rabbits playing, so I  went back for my little shotgun. I shot one of the rabbits, so I felt  very like Leather-stocking because I had killed but one when I might  have gotten two. It was fat and young, and it was but the work of a  moment to dress it and hang it up on a tree. Then I fried some slices  of bacon, made myself a cup of coffee, and Jerrine and I sat on the  ground and ate. Everything smelled and tasted so good! This air is so  tonic that one gets delightfully hungry. Afterward we watered and  restaked \"Jeems,\" I rolled some logs on to the fire, and then we sat  and enjoyed the prospect.    The moon was so new that its light was very dim, but the stars were  bright. Presently a long, quivering wail arose and was answered from a  dozen hills. It seemed just the sound one ought to hear in such a  place. When the howls ceased for a moment we could hear the subdued  roar of the creek and the crooning of the wind in the pines. So we  rather enjoyed the coyote chorus and were not afraid, because they  don't attack people. Presently we crept under our Navajos and, being  tired, were soon asleep.    I was awakened by a pebble striking my cheek. Something prowling on the  bluff above us had dislodged it and it struck me. By my Waterbury it  was four o'clock, so I arose and spitted my rabbit. The logs had left a  big bed of coals, but some ends were still burning and had burned in  such a manner that the heat would go both under and over my rabbit. So  I put plenty of bacon grease over him and hung him up to roast. Then I  went back to bed. I didn't want to start early because the air is too  keen for comfort early in the morning.    The sun was just gilding the hilltops when we arose. Everything, even  the barrenness, was beautiful. We have had frosts, and the quaking  aspens were a trembling field of gold as far up the stream as we could  see. We were 'way up above them and could look far across the valley.  We could see the silvery gold of the willows, the russet and bronze of  the currants, and patches of cheerful green showed where the pines  were. The splendor was relieved by a background of sober gray-green  hills, but even on them gay streaks and patches of yellow showed where  rabbit-brush grew. We washed our faces at the spring,--the grasses that  grew around the edge and dipped into the water were loaded with  ice,--our rabbit was done to a turn, so I made some delicious coffee,  Jerrine got herself a can of water, and we breakfasted. Shortly  afterwards we started again. We didn't know where we were going, but we  were on our way.    That day was more toilsome than the last, but a very happy one. The  meadowlarks kept singing like they were glad to see us. But we were  still climbing and soon got beyond the larks and sage chickens and up  into the timber, where there are lots of grouse. We stopped to noon by  a little lake, where I got two small squirrels and a string of trout.  We had some trout for dinner and salted the rest with the squirrels in  an empty can for future use. I was anxious to get a grouse and kept  close watch, but was never quick enough. Our progress was now slower  and more difficult, because in places we could scarcely get through the  forest. Fallen trees were everywhere and we had to avoid the branches,  which was powerful hard to do. Besides, it was quite dusky among the  trees long before night, but it was all so grand and awe-inspiring.  Occasionally there was an opening through which we could see the snowy  peaks, seemingly just beyond us, toward which we were headed. But when  you get among such grandeur you get to feel how little you are and how  foolish is human endeavor, except that which reunites us with the  mighty force called God. I was plumb uncomfortable, because all my own  efforts have always been just to make the best of everything and to  take things as they come.    At last we came to an open side of the mountain where the trees were  scattered. We were facing south and east, and the mountain we were on  sheered away in a dangerous slant. Beyond us still greater wooded  mountains blocked the way, and in the canon between night had already  fallen. I began to get scary. I could only think of bears and  catamounts, so, as it was five o'clock, we decided to camp. The trees  were immense. The lower branches came clear to the ground and grew so  dense that any tree afforded a splendid shelter from the weather, but I  was nervous and wanted one that would protect us against any possible  attack. At last we found one growing in a crevice of what seemed to be  a sheer wall of rock. Nothing could reach us on two sides, and in front  two large trees had fallen so that I could make a log heap which would  give us warmth and make us safe. So with rising spirits I unpacked and  prepared for the night. I soon had a roaring fire up against the logs  and, cutting away a few branches, let the heat into as snug a bedroom  as any one could wish. The pine needles made as soft a carpet as the  wealthiest could afford. Springs abound in the mountains, so water was  plenty. I staked \"Jeems\" quite near so that the firelight would  frighten away any wild thing that tried to harm him. Grass was very  plentiful, so when he was made \"comfy\" I made our bed and fried our  trout. The branches had torn off the bag in which I had my bread, so it  was lost in the forest, but who needs bread when they have good, mealy  potatoes? In a short time we were eating like Lent was just over. We  lost all the glory of the sunset except what we got by reflection,  being on the side of the mountain we were, with the dense woods  between. Big sullen clouds kept drifting over and a wind got lost in  the trees that kept them rocking and groaning in a horrid way. But we  were just as cozy as we could be and rest was as good as anything.    I wish you could once sleep on the kind of bed we enjoyed that night.  It was both soft and firm, with the clean, spicy smell of the pine. The  heat from our big fire came in and we were warm as toast. It was so  good to stretch out and rest. I kept thinking how superior I was since  I dared to take such an outing when so many poor women down in Denver  were bent on making their twenty cents per hour in order that they  could spare a quarter to go to the \"show.\" I went to sleep with a  powerfully self-satisfied feeling, but I awoke to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#3)"],[1," ours. Ach Gott! It is frightful to  live among echoes. The few that read the book, I imagine, will get  benefit of it. To America, I sometimes say that Emerson, such as he  is, seems to me like a kind of New Era.\"    John Morley, the acute English critic, has made an analytic study of  Emerson's style, which may reconcile the reader to some of its  exasperating peculiarities.    \"One of the traits that every critic notes in Emerson's writing is  that it is so abrupt, so sudden in its transitions, so discontinuous,  so inconsecutive. Dislike of a sentence that drags made him  unconscious of the quality that French critics name _coulant_.  Everything is thrown in just as it comes, and sometimes the pell-mell  is enough to persuade us that Pope did not exaggerate when he said  that no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the  power of rejecting his own thoughts.... Apart from his difficult  staccato, Emerson is not free from secondary faults. He uses words  that are not only odd, but vicious in construction; he is sometimes  oblique and he is often clumsy; and there is a visible feeling after  epigrams that do not always come. When people say that Emerson's style  must be good and admirable because it fits his thought, they forget  that though it is well that a robe should fit, there is still  something to be said about its cut and fashion.... Yet, as happens to  all fine minds, there came to Emerson ways of expression deeply marked  with character. On every page there is set the strong stamp of  sincerity, and the attraction of a certain artlessness; the most  awkward sentence rings true; and there is often a pure and simple note  that touches us more than if it were the perfection of elaborated  melody. The uncouth procession of the periods discloses the travail of  the thought, and that, too, is a kind of eloquence. An honest reader  easily forgives the rude jolt or unexpected start when it shows a  thinker faithfully working his way along arduous and unworn tracks.  Even at the roughest, Emerson often interjects a delightful cadence.  As he says of Landor, his sentences are cubes which will stand firm,  place them how or where you will. He criticised Swedenborg for being  superfluously explanatory, and having an exaggerated feeling of the  ignorance of men. 'Men take truths of this nature,' said Emerson,  'very fast;' and his own style does no doubt very boldly take this  capacity for granted in us. In 'choice and pith of diction,' again, of  which Mr. Lowell speaks, he hits the mark with a felicity that is  almost his own in this generation. He is terse, concentrated, and free  from the important blunder of mistaking intellectual dawdling for  meditation. Nor in fine does his abruptness ever impede a true  urbanity. The accent is homely and the apparel plain, but his bearing  has a friendliness, a courtesy, a hospitable humanity, which goes  nearer to our hearts than either literary decoration or rhetorical  unction. That modest and lenient fellow-feeling which gave such charm  to his companionship breathes in his gravest writing, and prevents us  from finding any page of it cold or hard or dry.\"    E.P. Whipple, the well-known American critic, wrote soon after Emerson's  death:    \"But 'sweetness and light' are precious and inspiring only so far as  they express the essential sweetness of the disposition of the  thinker, and the essential illuminating power of his intelligence.  Emerson's greatness came from his character. Sweetness and light  streamed from him because they were _in_ him. In everything he  thought, wrote, and did, we feel the presence of a personality as  vigorous and brave as it was sweet, and the particular radical thought  he at any time expressed derived its power to animate and illuminate  other minds from the might of the manhood, which was felt to be within  and behind it. To 'sweetness and light' he therefore added the prime  quality of fearless manliness.    \"If the force of Emerson's character was thus inextricably blended  with the force of all his faculties of intellect and imagination, and  the refinement of all his sentiments, we have still to account for the  peculiarities of his genius, and to answer the question, why do we  instinctively apply the epithet 'Emersonian' to every characteristic  passage in his writings? We are told that he was the last in a long  line of clergymen, his ancestors, and that the modern doctrine of  heredity accounts for the impressive emphasis he laid on the moral  sentiment; but that does not solve the puzzle why he unmistakably  differed in his nature and genius from all other Emersons. An  imaginary genealogical chart of descent connecting him with Confucius  or Gautama would be more satisfactory.    \"What distinguishes _the_ Emerson was his exceptional genius and  character, that something in him which separated him from all other  Emersons, as it separated him from all other eminent men of letters,  and impressed every intelligent reader with the feeling that he was  not only 'original but aboriginal.' Some traits of his mind and  character may be traced back to his ancestors, but what doctrine of  heredity can give us the genesis of his genius? Indeed, the safest  course to pursue is to quote his own words, and despairingly confess  that it is the nature of genius 'to spring, like the rainbow daughter  of Wonder, from the invisible, to abolish the past, and refuse all  history.'\"          CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF EMERSON'S PRINCIPAL WORKS.

This address was delivered at Cambridge in 1837, before the       Harvard Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, a college       fraternity composed of the first twenty-five men in each       graduating class. The society has annual meetings, which       have been the occasion for addresses from the most       distinguished scholars and thinkers of the day.      MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,    I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our  anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do  not meet for games of strength[1] or skill, for the recitation of  histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for  parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours;[2] nor for the  advancement of science, like our co-temporaries in the British and  European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly  sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy  to give to letters any more. As such it is precious as the sign of an  indestructible instinct. Perhaps the time is already come when it  ought to be, and will be, something else; when the sluggard intellect  of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the  postponed expectation of the world with something better than the  exertions of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long  apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The  millions that around us are rushing into life cannot always be fed on  the sere remains of foreign harvests.[3] Events, actions arise that  must be sung, that will sing themselves. Who can doubt that poetry  will revive and lead in a new age, as the star in the constellation  Harp, which now flames in our zenith, astronomers announce, shall one  day be the pole-star[4] for a thousand years?    In the light of this hope I accept the topic which not only usage but  the nature of our association seem to prescribe to this day,--the  AMERICAN SCHOLAR. Year by year we come up hither to read one  more chapter of his biography. Let us inquire what new lights, new  events, and more days have thrown on his character, his duties, and  his hopes.    It is one of those fables which out of an unknown antiquity convey an  unlooked-for wisdom, that the gods, in the beginning, divided Man into  men, that he might be more helpful to himself; just as the hand was  divided into fingers, the better to answer its end.[5]    The old fable covers a doctrine ever new and sublime; that there is  One Man,--present to all particular men only partially, or through one  faculty; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole  man. Man is not a farmer, or a professor, or an engineer, but he is  all. Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and producer, and  soldier. In the _divided_ or social state these functions are parceled  out to individuals, each of whom aims to do his stint[6] of the joint  work, whilst each other performs his. The fable implies that the  individual, to possess himself, must sometimes return from his own  labor to embrace all the other laborers. But, unfortunately, this  original unit, this fountain of power, has been so distributed to  multitudes, has been so minutely subdivided and peddled out, that it  is spilled into drops, and cannot be gathered. The state of society is  one in which the members have suffered amputation from the trunk and  strut about so many walking monsters,--a good finger, a neck, a  stomach, an elbow, but never a man.    Man is thus metamorphosed into a thing, into many things. The planter,  who is Man sent out into the field to gather food, is seldom cheered  by any idea of the true dignity of his ministry. He sees his bushel  and his cart, and nothing beyond, and sinks into the farmer, instead  of Man on the farm. The tradesman scarcely ever gives an ideal worth  to his work, but is ridden[7] by the routine of his craft, and the  soul is subject to dollars. The priest becomes a form; the attorney a  statute-book; the mechanic a machine;"]]]
