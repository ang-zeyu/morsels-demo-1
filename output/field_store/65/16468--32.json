[*Petrie, Nagada and Ballas, p. 49.] Were this so, it  is patent that the Palaeolithic flints could not have been found on the  desert surface as they are. Mr. H. J. L. Beadnell, of the Geological  Survey of Egypt, to whom we are indebted for the promulgation of the  more modern and probable view, says: \"Is it certain that the high  plateau was then clothed with forests? What evidence is there to show  that it differed in any important respect from its present aspect? And  if, as I suggest, desert conditions obtained then as now, and man merely  worked his flints along the edges of the plateaus overlooking the  Nile valley, I see no reason why flint implements, dating even from  Palaeolithic times should not in favourable cases still be found in  the spots where they were left, surrounded by the flakes struck off in  manufacture. On the flat plateaus the occasional rains which fall--once  in three or four years--can effect but little transport of material, and  merely lower the general level by dissolving the underlying limestone,  so that the plateau surface is left with a coating of nodules and blocks  of insoluble flint and chert. Flint implements might thus be expected  to remain in many localities for indefinite periods, but they would  certainly become more or less 'patinated,' pitted on the surface, and  rounded at the angles after long exposure to heat, cold, and blown  sand.\" This is exactly the case of the Palaeolithic flint tools from the  desert plateau.    [Illustration: 012.jpg UPPER DESERT PLATEAU, WHERE PALEOLITHIC  IMPLEMENTS ARE FOUND, Thebes: 1,400 leet above the Nile.]    We do not know whether Palaeolithic man in Egypt was contemporary with  the cave-man of Europe. We have no means of gauging the age of the  Palaeolithic Egyptian weapons, as we have for the Neolithic period.  The historical (dynastic) period of Egyptian annals began with the  unification of the kingdom under one head somewhere about 4500 B.C. At  that time copper as well as stone weapons were used, so that we may say  that at the beginning of the historical age the Egyptians were living  in the \"Chalcolithic\" period. We can trace the use of copper back for  a considerable period anterior to the beginning of the Ist Dynasty,  so that we shall probably not be far wrong if we do not bring down the  close of the purely Neolithic Age in Egypt--the close of the Age of  Stone, properly so called--later than +5000 B.C. How far back in the  remote ages the transition period between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic  Ages should be placed, it is utterly impossible to say. The use of stone  for weapons and implements continued in Egypt as late as the time of  the XIIth Dynasty, about 2500-2000 B.C. But these XIIth Dynasty stone  implements show by their forms how late they are in the history of the  Stone Age. The axe heads, for instance, are in form imitations of  the copper and bronze axe heads usual at that period; they are stone  imitations of metal, instead of the originals on whose model the metal  weapons were formed. The flint implements of the XIIth Dynasty were  a curious survival from long past ages. After the time of the XIIth  Dynasty stone was no longer used for tools or weapons, except for the  sacred rite of making the first incision in the dead bodies before  beginning the operations of embalming; for this purpose, as Herodotus  tells us, an \"Ethiopian stone\" was used. This was no doubt a knife of  flint or chert, like those of the Neolithic ancestors of the Egyptians,  and the continued use of a stone knife for this one purpose only is a  very interesting instance of a ceremonial survival. We may compare the  wigs of British judges.    [Illustration: 014.jpg FLINT KNIFE]    We have no specimen of a flint knife which can definitely be asserted to  have belonged to an embalmer, but of the archaistic flint weapons of the  XIIth Dynasty we have several specimens. They were found by Prof. Petrie  at the place named by him \"Kahun,\" the site of a XIIth Dynasty town  built near the pyramid of King Usertsen (or Senusret) II at Illahun,  at the mouth of the canal leading from the Nile valley into the  oasis-province of the Payyum. These Kahun flints, and others of probably  the same period found by Mr. Seton-Karr at the very ancient flint  works in the Wadi esh-Shekh, are of very coarse and poor workmanship  as compared with the stone-knapping triumphs of the late Neolithic and  early Chalcolithic periods. The delicacy of the art had all been lost.  But the best flint knives of the early period--dating to just a little  before the time of the Ist Dynasty, when flint-working had attained its  apogee, and copper had just begun to be used--are undoubtedly the most  remarkable stone weapons ever made in the world. The grace and utility  of the form, the delicacy of the fluted chipping on the side, and  the minute care with which the tiny serrations of the cutting edge,  serrations so small that often they can hardly be seen with the naked  eye, are made, can certainly not be parallelled elsewhere. The art  of flint-knapping reached its zenith in Ancient Egypt. The specimen  illustrated has a handle covered with gold decorated with incised  designs representing animals.    The prehistoric Egyptians may also fairly be said to have attained  greater perfection than other peoples in the Neolithic stage of culture,  in other arts besides the making of stone tools and weapons. Their  pottery is of remarkable perfection. Now that the sites of the Egyptian  prehistoric settlements have been so thoroughly explored by competent  archaeologists (and, unhappily, as thoroughly pillaged by incompetent  natives), this prehistoric Egyptian pottery has become extremely well  known. In fact, it is so common that good specimens may be bought  anywhere in Egypt for a few piastres. Most museums possess sets of this  pottery, of which great quantities have been brought back from Egypt  by Prof. Petrie and other explorers. It is of very great interest,  artistically as well as historically. The potter's wheel was not yet  invented, and all the vases, even those of the most perfect shape, were  built up by hand. The perfection of form attained without the aid of the  wheel is truly marvellous.    The commonest type of this pottery is a red polished ware vase with  black top, due to its having been baked mouth downward in a fire, the  ashes of which, according to Prof. Petrie, deoxidized the haematite  burnishing, and so turned the red colour to black. \"In good examples  the haematite has not only been reduced to black magnetic oxide, but  the black has the highest polish, as seen on fine Greek vases. This is  probably due to the formation of carbonyl gas in the smothered fire.  This gas acts as a solvent of magnetic oxide, and hence allows it to  assume a new surface, like the glassy surface of some marbles subjected  to solution in water.\" This black and red ware appears to be the most  ancient prehistoric Egyptian pottery known. Later in date are a red  ware and a black ware with rude geometrical incised designs, imitating  basketwork, and with the incised lines filled in with white. Later again  is a buff ware, either plain or decorated with wavy lines, concentric  circles, and elaborate drawings of boats sailing on the Nile, ostriches,  fish, men and women, and so on.    [Illustration: 017.jpg (right) BUFF WARE VASE, Predynastic period,  before 4000 B.C.]    These designs are in deep red. With this elaborate pottery the Neolithic  ceramic art of Egypt reached its highest point; in the succeeding period  (the beginning of the historic age) there was a decline in workmanship,  exhibiting clumsy forms and bad colour, and it is not until the time of  the IVth Dynasty that good pottery (a fine polished red) is once more  found. Meanwhile the invention of glazed pottery, which was unknown to  the prehistoric Egyptians, had been made (before the beginning of the  Ist Dynasty). The unglazed ware of the first three dynasties was bad,  but the new invention of light blue glazed faience (not porcelain  properly so called) seems to have made great progress, and we possess  fine specimens at the beginning of the Ist Dynasty. The prehistoric  Egyptians were also proficient in other arts. They carved ivory and they  worked gold, which is known to have been almost the first metal worked  by man; certainly in Egypt it was utilized for ornament even before  copper was used for work. We may refer to the illustration of a flint  knife with gold handle, already given. [* See illustration.]    The date of the actual introduction of copper for tools and weapons into  Egypt is uncertain, but it seems probable that copper was occasionally  used at a very early period. Copper weapons have been found in  pre-dynastic graves beside the finest buff pottery with elaborate red  designs, so that we may say that when the flint-working and pottery of  the Neolithic Egyptians had reached its zenith, the use of copper was  already known, and copper weapons were occasionally employed. We can  thus speak of the \"Chalcolithic\" period in Egypt as having already begun  at that time, no doubt several centuries before the beginning of the  historical or dynastic age. Strictly speaking, the Egyptians remained  in the \"Chalcolithic\" period till the end of the XIIth Dynasty, but in  practice it is best to speak of this period, when the word is used, as  extending from the time of the finest flint weapons and pottery of the  prehistoric age (when the \"Neolithic\" period may be said to close) till  about the IId or IIId Dynasty. By that time the \"Bronze,\" or, rather,  \"Copper,\" Age of Egypt had well begun, and already stone was not in  common use.    The prehistoric pottery is of the greatest value to the archaeologist,  for with its help some idea may be obtained of the succession of periods  within the late Neolithic-Chalcolithic Age. The enormous number of  prehistoric graves which have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"that which best suited the _shade_  of guest or of master.    Even to-day, when we enter one of these decorated chapels, the idea of  death scarcely presents itself: we have rather the impression of being  in some old-world house, to which the master may at any moment return.  We see him portrayed everywhere upon the walls, followed by his  servants, and surrounded by everything which made his earthly life  enjoyable. One or two statues of him stand at the end of the room, in  constant readiness to undergo the \"Opening of the Mouth\" and to receive  offerings. Should these be accidentally removed, others, secreted in  a little chamber hidden in the thickness of the masonry, are there to  replace them. These inner chambers have rarely any external outlet,  though occasionally they are connected with the chapel by a small  opening, so narrow that it will hardly admit of a hand being passed  through it. Those who came to repeat prayers and burn incense at this  aperture were received by the dead in person. The statues were not mere  images, devoid of consciousness. Just as the double of a god could be  linked to an idol in the temple sanctuary in order to transform it into  a prophetic being, capable of speech and movement, so when the double of  a man was attached to the effigy of his earthly body, whether in stone,  metal, or wood, a real living person was created and was introduced into  the tomb. So strong was this conviction that the belief has lived on  through two changes of religion until the present day. The double still  haunts the statues with which he was associated in the past. As in  former times, he yet strikes with madness or death any who dare to  disturb is repose; and one can only be protected from him by breaking,  at the moment of discovery, the perfect statues which the vault  contains. The double is weakened or killed by the mutilation of these  his sustainers.*         * The legends still current about the pyramids of Gizeh       furnish some good examples of this kind of superstition.       \"The guardian of the Eastern pyramid was an idol... who had       both eyes open, and was seated on a throne, having a sort of       halberd near it, on which, if any one fixed his eye, he       heard a fearful noise, which struck terror to his heart, and       caused the death of the hearer. There was a spirit appointed       to wait on each guardian, who departed not from before       him.\" The keeping of the other two pyramids was in like       manner entrusted to a statue, assisted by a spirit. I have       collected a certain number of tales resembling that of       Mourtadi in the _Etudes de Mythologie et Archeologie       Egyptiennes,_ vol. i. p. 77, et seq.    The statues furnish in their modelling a more correct idea of the  deceased than his mummy, disfigured as it was by the work of the  embalmers; they were also less easily destroyed, and any number could  be made at will. Hence arose the really incredible number of statues  sometimes hidden away in the same tomb. These sustainers or imperishable  bodies of the double were multiplied so as to insure for him a practical  immortality; and the care with which they were shut into a secure  hiding-place, increased their chances of preservation. All the same, no  precaution was neglected that could save a mummy from destruction. The  shaft leading to it descended to a mean depth of forty to fifty feet,  but sometimes it reached, and even exceeded, a hundred feet. Running  horizontally from it is a passage so low as to prevent a man standing  upright in it, which leads to the sepulchral chamber properly so called,  hewn out of the solid rock and devoid of all ornament; the sarcophagus,  whether of fine limestone, rose-granite, or black basalt, does not  always bear the name and titles of the deceased. The servants who  deposited the body in it placed beside it on the dusty floor the  quarters of the ox, previously slaughtered in the chapel, as well as  phials of perfume, and large vases of red pottery containing muddy  water; after which they walled up the entrance to the passage and filled  the shaft with chips of stone intermingled with earth and gravel. The  whole, being well watered, soon hardened into a compact mass, which  protected the vault and its master from desecration.    During the course of centuries, the ever-increasing number of tombs at  length formed an almost uninterrupted chain of burying-places on the  table-land. At Gizeh they follow a symmetrical plan, and line the sides  of regular roads; at Saqqara they are scattered about on the surface  of the ground, in some places sparsely, in others huddled confusedly  together. Everywhere the tombs are rich in inscriptions, statues, and  painted or sculptured scenes, each revealing some characteristic custom,  or some detail of contemporary civilization. From the womb, as it were,  of these cemeteries, the Egypt of the Memphite dynasties gradually takes  new life, and reappears in the full daylight of history. Nobles and  fellahs, soldiers and priests, scribes and craftsmen,--the whole nation  lives anew before us; each with his manners, his dress, his daily round  of occupation and pleasures. It is a perfect picture, and although in  places the drawing is defaced and the colour dimmed, yet these may be  restored with no great difficulty, and with almost absolute certainty.  The king stands out boldly in the foreground, and his tall figure towers  over all else. He so completely transcends his surroundings, that at  first sight one may well ask if he does not represent a god rather than  a man; and, as a matter of fact, he is a god to his subjects. They call  him \"the good god,\" \"the great god,\" and connect him with Ra through the  intervening kings, the successors of the gods who ruled the two worlds.  His father before him was \"Son of Ra,\" as was also his grandfather, and  his great-grandfather, and so through all his ancestors, until from  \"son of Ra\" to \"son of Ra\" they at last reached Ra himself. Sometimes  an adventurer of unknown antecedents is abruptly inserted in the series,  and we might imagine that he would interrupt the succession of the solar  line; but on closer examination we always find that either the intruder  is connected with the god by a genealogy hitherto unsuspected, or that  he is even more closely related to him than his predecessors, inasmuch  as Ra, having secretly descended upon the earth, had begotten him by a  mortal mother in order to rejuvenate the race.*         * A legend, preserved for us in the Westcar Papyrus (Erman's       edition, pl. ix. 11. 5-11, pl. x. 1. 5, et seq.), maintains       that the first three kings of the Vth dynasty, Usirkaf,       Sahuri, and Kakiu, were children born to Ra, lord of       Sakhibu, by Ruditdidit, wife of a priest attached to the       temple of that town.    If things came to the worst, a marriage with some princess would soon  legitimise, if not the usurper himself, at least his descendants, and  thus firmly re-establish the succession.    [Illustration: 021.jpg THE BIRTH OF A KING AND HIS DOUBLE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Gay et. The       king is Amenothes III., whose conception and birth are       represented in the temple of Luxor, with the same wealth of       details that we should have expected, had he been a son of       the god Amon and the goddess Mut.    The Pharaohs, therefore, are blood-relations of the Sun-god, some  through their father, others through their mother, directly begotten  by the God, and their souls as well as their bodies have a supernatural  origin; each soul being a double detached from Horus, the successor of  Osiris, and the first to reign alone over Egypt. This divine double  is infused into the royal infant at birth, in the same manner as the  ordinary double is incarnate in common mortals. It always remained  concealed, and seemed to lie dormant in those princes whom destiny did  not call upon to reign, but it awoke to full self-consciousness in those  who ascended the throne at the moment of their accession. From that time  to the hour of their death, and beyond it, all that they possessed of  ordinary humanity was completely effaced; they were from henceforth  only \"the sons of Ra,\" the Horus, dwelling upon earth, who, during his  sojourn here below, renews the blessings of Horus, son of Isis. Their  complex nature was revealed at the outset in the form and arrangement of  their names. Among the Egyptians the choice of a name was not a matter  of indifference; not only did men and beasts, but even inanimate  objects, require one or more names, and it may be said that no person or  thing in the world could attain to complete existence until the name  had been conferred. The most ancient names were often only a short word,  which denoted some moral or physical quality, as Titi the Runner, Mini  the Lasting, Qonqeni the Crusher, Sondi the Formidable, Uznasit the  Flowery-tongued. They consisted also of short sentences, by which  the royal child confessed his faith in the power of the gods, and his  participation in the acts of the Sun's life--\"Khafri,\" his rising is  Ra; \"Men-kauhoru,\" the doubles of Horus last for ever; \"Usirkeri,\" the  double of Ra is omnipotent. Sometimes the sentence is shortened, and the  name of the god is understood: as for instance, \"Usirkaf,\" his double is  omnipotent; \"Snofmi,\" he has made me good; \"Khufiii,\" he has protected  me, are put for the names \"Usirkeri,\" \"Ptahsnofrui,\" \"Khnumkhufui,\" with  the suppression of Ra, Phtah, and Khnurnu.    [Illustration: 023.jpg PAGE IMAGE]    The name having once, as it were, taken possession of a man on his  entrance into life, never leaves him either in this world or the next;  the prince who had been called Unas or Assi at the moment of his birth,  retained this name even after death, so long as his mummy existed, and  his double was not annihilated.         {Hieroglyphics"]]]
