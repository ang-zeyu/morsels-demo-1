Many people have come to visit  us, to see the new arrivals!    \"The evening of the day on which we arrived was Friday; there was a  clear moonlight such as you would not often see in England, and it was  very warm, too; so we and our visitors sat in the courtyard. All eagerly  asked us many questions, till quite late; and thus the evening passed  very quickly and pleasantly.    \"After prayers on Sabbath some people sent a bottle of wine and a most  delicious pudding, which is made nowhere but in Jerusalem. It tastes  like milk and honey, with other tasty things mixed up in it. Others sent  a lovely sponge cake, coated with different-coloured sugar-icing: many  other good things were also given to us; and they lasted us for nearly a  month.    \"Later in the day the people who sent the eatables paid us visits, and  ate some of the good things. It is rather a nice custom, I think, for  new arrivals to have no bother to prepare food for their visitors, as it  gives them time to enjoy their company. What a lot of talking there was!  The men discussed several things with Father, while the women wanted to  know many things about England which Mother could tell them. The boys  and girls could not take their eyes off our clothes, so much did they  admire them! It was quite amusing, the funny questions they asked us  about them. They all promised to help us look for a dwelling; and they  kept their promise. I can tell you it was a great help and comfort to us  that they did, for I don't know what would have become of us out here,  away from our old friends, where the ways of living are so different  from what we have been used to. Whether it will always be so or not, of  course I can't say--time alone will show.    \"Very soon afterwards they found us a vacant dwelling, which Father was  very thankful to get, and in my next letter I will tell you something of  our life after we had moved in; but I must tell you more of what  happened when we were staying with our kind host. The first afternoon,  one of our visitors insisted on our I going to her home; so, when I and  our youngsters arrived, we were taken to a room, and in it was a table  covered with lovely apricots, and delicious-looking pastries and jams;  also wine which only cost 3d. a bottle, so it is very nearly as cheap as  buying water. When they handed us some of the good things we naturally  took them and ate them.    \"Suddenly I saw our host's children move away from us saying: 'She is a  Shiksa,' and 'He is a Shakitz,' and they kept on whispering and pointing  to us. I could not think what we had done to make them act in such a  way, and so asked their mother. She answered: 'They are surprised to see  you eating without making a Brocha (a blessing), for our children unless  they first make a Brocha never taste anything.'    \"You know, dear Milly, that, though we too were taught to do as they  here, yet the hurry and scurry of going to school and the busy life in  London have made us forget to practise these religious laws. We,  however, felt very uncomfortable and ashamed of ourselves, and made up  our minds to get into the habit of doing it--that is to remember to  thank our Creator for every blessing we receive, including food--so that  it should become a matter-of-course.    \"Now I must tell you about our water-supply, for the scarcity of water  struck us, very much, coming from London; for here every drop is  precious and is used for several things, as every drop has to be  bought, and money amongst our Jerusalem brethren is very scarce. In  fact, it often costs more than the wine of the country.    \"A water-carrier brings us up every morning a skin bag of water (it is  made of skins sewn together, with a small outlet at the top); for it we  pay twopence, which is equal to more than a shilling in London. The  water that he brings he pours into a large earthern jar, which keeps it  cool, and to it is attached over the mouth of the jar a sieve which is  made of thick unbleached calico: if this were not done, hundreds of  little red worms would get into the jar, because the water in Palestine  is full of them. A law was made by the Jews that to drink water that had  not been passed through a sieve was a sin; and, as little children are  taught not to commit any sin, they do not drink any water that has not  been passed through a sieve; owing to this, many illnesses are prevented  among the Jews that are rampant among the Arabs and others.    \"The Jews are also very careful about their water for ordinary use, yet  they really employ it more plentifully than we do in London when used in  connection with laws of health as laid down in the Shulchan Aruch (a  book of laws). For example, as soon as you step out of your bed, you  pour water over your hands, wash your face, gargle your throat, and rub  your teeth with a clean finger and rinse your mouth. No one would think  of moving out of the room without doing this. I know among the very  orthodox Jews in London they do the same thing, but the average Jew does  not do it, and here it is done by everyone--even a baby is taught to do  it the same way.    \"Later in the day, or when the men go to Synagogue, and we have finished  with our household duties, we have the regular soap-and-water wash. Then  again, everytime we have a meal we have to wash our hands and repeat a  blessing; and, as this is done at various other times in a large family,  it takes a good deal of water, but as it is used for cleaning purposes  we need not stint ourselves. This law is especially valuable here, for  it is very hot, and, if we were not very clean and especially careful  about cleansing our eyes and mouths and throat, we should run the risk  of catching a great many diseases which are quite common in the Holy  Land at present.    \"I remarked to some women that it surprised me how much water was used  for personal washing considering how scarce it was, but they told me  that they were as careful with every drop of water as they were with  food; none was wasted. Where the religious laws commanded the use of  water for personal washing and cleansing they did not grudge it; for  was not the body of man the temple where the Holy Spirit of God dwelt?  God's spirit is in each one of us, and, therefore, we must do our best  to keep our bodies clean for the presence of our Heavenly King, just as  carefully as we should keep a house or palace clean in which our earthly  king dwelt--more carefully indeed. What would courtiers around an  earthly king say if they saw us take our food in the presence of the  king, and praise him, with dirty hands?    \"They save water in many ways that are rather amusing to a stranger  until he gets to know the reason for it. For instance, they do not, at  meals, use different plates on the Sabbath, when they have a few  courses: they eat the fish on one side of the plate, and then they wipe  it and turn the plate over, and have soup and meat on the deeper  side--thus saving the washing of many plates.    \"In my next letter I will write you all my tribulations and struggles in  getting used to the new life when we moved into our own house. My great  comfort is that we have got to know an American family, and they have  been so kind to us and so cheery that it has made us feel a bit  brighter, and Mother says that in time we shall get used to our new  life. But I doubt it after living in London.\"    When Mr Jacob had finished reading the letter the young folks began  talking, the older ones listening and giving a smile now and then.    One said: \"I should not like to be there.\"    \"Neither should I,\" said another girl; \"it must be awful after London.\"    \"The only thing that I like about the life,\" said the former, \"is the  hospitality and the friendliness that they show to one another, and the  jolly good time they give to people who are utter strangers to them. We  don't do that here--we seem cold and unfriendly.\"          THE CELEBRATION OF PURIM      As had now become a custom, the young friends of the Jacobs had all  collected on the next Friday evening in the bright and warm  kitchen-sitting room. After a short friendly chat with them Mr Jacobs  said:    \"As Purim will begin in two days, perhaps you would like to hear how our  cousins saw it celebrated when they went to Palestine, so I have chosen  this letter to read to you this evening:    \"In Jerusalem a week is none too long to prepare for Purim. As you know,  when we lived in London we always were strict about keeping our holy  days; but while there I never realized the pleasure and excitement  during Purim that one sees in Jerusalem.    \"Old and young are equally full of fun and joy, and there is plenty of  rushing about with sleeves tucked up. At other times the women here  gossip a great deal, and the girls naturally copy their elders and  gossip too; but, when preparing for Purim, they are all too busy to talk  or even to ask questions. The boys, too, up to the age of twelve, are  allowed to help. Some break up the big pieces of loaf-sugar, and beat up  the eggs, and take the cakes, when ready, to the public ovens, for here  there are no proper ovens as there are in London houses, so a public  oven is built not far from the Synagogue. It is very large, and each  family sends its cakes in its own tins to be baked in it. Generally  about half a dozen tins are carried by each boy. Nothing I have seen  before can be compared with the many kinds of delicious cakes and  stuffed monkeys that are seen here. My mouth waters even when I think of  the delicious strudels filled with sesames and plenty of raisins and  shiros! These things are very cheap here.    \"As there are not many boys free to help, you see quite young children,  as well as young women and even grandmothers, going to and from the  public oven, carrying tins of all the Purim delicacies. As they wait  while the cakes are being baked, or waiting their turn to have their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15193"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 841, February 13, 1892 (#3)"],[1,"due to the same cause as in the preceding  night--the presence and attacks of the wolf. I could not have realized  their meaning if I had not been a witness of the scene--that is, I  could not have correlated the cries and the acts.    A shot at the animal behind the bushes was followed by a hoarse cry.  He was hit, and ran; but, in spite of our urgings, the dogs stayed at  the gate and only stopped howling. Under any other conditions, upon  the signal of the shot they would all have started in pursuit of the  wounded animal.    A wolf came to the farm during the last winter (1890-91) and attacked  the same bitch. He would have carried her off, for he had seized her  by the throat, if we could judge from the stifled cries she uttered;  but this time he found with her a new watch dog--a mountain bitch from  the Pyrenees--of a breed that attacks the wolf and the bear. The wolf  would have been caught if he had not run away. He did not return, for  he had been attacked, and learned what he had to deal with.    The Pyrenean breed furnishes excellent watch dogs. I knew one of  remarkable traits. At evening he would go round the house, giving two  or three growls at each door. With his head raised he seemed to listen  to his fine voice, then he would start again and go to another door.  He seemed desirous to show those who were observing him that he was  attending to his post as guardian. He then went away in silence along  the walk, through a dark, rising hedgerow, leaping the slight hillock,  yelping toward the wood. He listened, yelped again, and went in. There  was never any failure in this performance, but every evening as night  was coming on he began his round, which no one had taught him. It was  all done in his function as a guard. It would be hard to determine  what his yelps meant, but there were in them an inflection, a  sonorousness, and a continuance quite different from those he uttered  when pursuing a passer-by or when going to meet a person coming toward  the house. Every one who has a watch dog is able to tell by the sound  of his barking when a person is coming up, and usually what sort of a  visitor it is.    The peasants' dogs of the southwest of France dislike the country  millers, because of the long whips which they are always carrying and  snapping, and with which the dogs, running after them, are often  struck. From as far off as the snapping of the whip can be heard, the  dogs come to wait for the millers and pursue them; and it is easy to  recognize when the millers are passing, by the behavior of the dogs.  There is in this also a significance, at once aggressive and  defensive, in the cries which one can, by giving a little attention,  soon learn to distinguish.    Another example of the reality of the various meanings of the cries of  the dog under different circumstances is afforded by the companies  that collect around a female in heat.    I have a very intelligent and experienced brach hound, the same which  with the bitch had to face the attack of the wolf. He amuses me much  at my country lunches. Hunting dogs which have been much with their  masters at lunch do not like to have the drinking glass offered them.  This dog was much afraid of the glass, and I had only to present it to  him at lunch time to make him keep his distance. I used to keep my  door open at lunch, for the amusement of observing how I could make  him stop exactly at the threshold without stepping over it. If he had  passed over it I could always send him back by casting toward him a  few drops of water from the bottom of the glass after drinking.  Sitting, as was his habit, on the sill of the door, with the tip of  his muzzle never extending beyond the plane of the panels, he would  follow my motions with the closest attention, reminding me, if I  failed to give him a sign of attention, by a discreet, plaintive cry,  that he was there. But if I touched my glass, he would spring up at  once; if I filled it, he would put himself on guard, utter a kind of  sigh, sneeze, lick his lips, yawn, and, shaking his ears briskly, make  little stifled cries. Then he would grow impatient, and more and more  watchful and nervous. When I lifted my glass to my lips he would draw  back, working gradually nearer to the farther door, and at last  disappear and hide. One who was looking at him without seeing me could  tell by his wails and his attitude the level and position of my glass.  When the glass was horizontal, I could see only about half of his  head, with one eye regarding me fixedly, for that was usually the  critical moment--the one, also, when the wails and restraints were  most demonstrative of the anxious fear of my poor animal.    When we dine in the kitchen, which is on the ground floor, the dogs  are usually all put out. There are four of them, three young and not  experienced, and this old, sagacious brach hound. He insists on coming  in, and, to gain his purpose, tries to have the door opened. Although  no person may be coming up the walk, he dashes down it barking, all  the others going along too and yelping with him; then he stops,  remains a little behind after having got the others out of the way,  and, turning his head from moment to moment, looks to see if the door  has been opened, for we generally go to it to see who has come. In  that case the feigned attack is successful, and the dog, who has  evidently meant to give the alarm so as to have the door opened, comes  in at once and claims a place at the table. He has accomplished his  end, for the door is usually shut without paying attention to his  having got in. I have frequently witnessed this stratagem, and when,  during my kitchen dinner, I suddenly hear the dogs yelping after the  brach hound has begun, I am pretty sure that nobody is in sight.    I have forgotten where I found the next story of an old dog who was  also very sagacious. Hunting dogs, when they grow old, become  rheumatic, or are at least debilitated with pains. We know, too, that  they crave heat, and get as near the fire as possible--a craving which  increases as they grow older. One such dog, older than the others, and  slower in getting into the lodge on returning from the hunt, was often  crowded away from the fire by the other livelier dogs getting all the  best places before him. Finding himself thus turned out in the cold,  he would dash toward the door barking, when the others, supposing it  was an alarm, would rush away too, while the old rheumatic went to the  fire and selected a place to suit him.    It is not necessary to dwell upon the intelligence shown by such acts.  But it is hardly contestable that the old animal, who knows how to  play such tricks upon his less experienced companions, deceives them  by his intonations, while he is well aware that no enemy is  approaching the house; but he does it scientifically, by the  inflections of his voice, as a man speaking to other men would do in  announcing the arrival of an imaginary enemy.    Inarticulate cries are all pretty much the same to us; their  inflections, duration, pitch, abruptness, and prolongation alone can  inform us of their purpose. But experience and close attention have  shown us the connection of these variations with the acts that  accompany or precede them. Animals evidently understand these  inflections at once. We cannot better compare the language of animals  than with what takes place in a pleasant sport, a kind of pantomime of  the voice or language which many youth doubtless understand, and which  I venture to refer to here to aid in more easily conceiving of the  communication of thought among animals by sounds which seem to us all  alike. When I was engaged in hospitals, the evenings in the guard room  were sometimes enlivened by the presence of a companion who excelled  in humorous mimicry. He would represent a man in liquor who had  stopped at a fountain that flowed with a gentle sound, somewhat like  that of his own hiccough. A single oath, pronounced in different  tones, was sufficient to enable us to comprehend all the impressions,  all the states of mind through which this devotee of Bacchus passed.  The oath, at first pronounced slowly and with an accent expressing  relief, represented a feeling of satisfaction, with shadings of  prolonged exclamation which it would be hard for one to imagine  without suggestion. The continued flowing of the fountain made our  drunken man impatient, and he wanted it to stop. This state of mind  was translated by a new modulation of the same word. In a little while  the gurgling of the fountain produced astonishment. Was it possible  that he, with all the liquid he had imbibed, could vomit so much and  for so long a time? This mental condition was expressed by a new  modulation of the same oath. The first movement of surprise over,  resignation follows, and our man decides to wait patiently for the  end. A period of half lethargy was easily represented by the slowness  and weakness of the man's voice while living up to this decision; but  when he comes out of this sleepy condition and hears the fountain  again, he is possessed with fear; he cannot understand the flood he is  pouring out--he dares not move--he believes he is lost. Gradually the  fumes of the liquor pass away, and, his mistake being recognized, the  drunkard is taken with a laughing and a gayety which are indicated by  the same oath repeated in tones corresponding with the satisfaction he  is then enjoying. This making the series of impressions a man passes  through comprehensible by a single word, varied in pronunciation and  utterance, is very like the language of animals, which is always the  same, and the significance of which is given by variety of intonations  corresponding with sensational conditions.    The mewing of the cat is always the same; but what a number of mental  conditions it expresses! I had a kitten whose gambols and liveliness  entertained me greatly. I "]]]
