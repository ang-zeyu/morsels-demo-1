Then they seem to have made their history backwards, and  worked up their old stories and songs to explain the names and customs  they found among them, and the tales they told were formed into a great  history by one Titus Livius. It is needful to know these stories which  every one used to believe to be really history; so we will tell them  first, beginning, however, with a story told by the poet Virgil.          CHAPTER II.    THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS.      You remember in the Greek history the burning of Troy, and how Priam and  all his family were cut off. Among the Trojans there was a prince called  AEneas, whose father was Anchises, a cousin of Priam, and his mother was  said to be the goddess Venus. When he saw that the city was lost, he  rushed back to his house, and took his old father Anchises on his back,  giving him his Penates, or little images of household gods, to take care  of, and led by the hand his little son Iulus, or Ascanius, while his  wife Creusa followed close behind, and all the Trojans who could get  their arms together joined him, so that they escaped in a body to Mount  Ida; but just as they were outside the city he missed poor Creusa, and  though he rushed back and searched for her everywhere, he never could  find her. For the sake of his care for his gods, and for his old father,  he is always known as the pious AEneas.    In the forests of Mount Ida he built ships enough to set forth with all  his followers in quest of the new home which his mother, the goddess  Venus, gave him hopes of. He had adventures rather like those of Ulysses  as he sailed about the Mediterranean. Once in the Strophades, some  clusters belonging to the Ionian Islands, when he and his troops had  landed to get food, and were eating the flesh of the numerous goats  which they found climbing about the rocks, down on them came the  harpies, horrible birds with women's faces and hooked hands, with which  they snatched away the food and spoiled what they could not eat. The  Trojans shot at them, but the arrows glanced off their feathers and did  not hurt them. However, they all flew off except one, who sat on a high  rock, and croaked out that the Trojans would be punished for thus  molesting the harpies by being tossed about till they should reach  Italy, but there they should not build their city till they should have  been so hungry as to eat their very trenchers.    [Illustration: THE COAST.]    They sailed away from this dismal prophetess, and touched on the coast  of Epirus, where AEneas found his cousin Helenus, son to old Priam,  reigning over a little new Troy, and married to Andromache, Hector's  wife, whom he had gained after Pyrrhus had been killed. Helenus was a  prophet, and gave AEneas much advice. In especial he said that when the  Trojans should come to Italy, they would find, under the holly-trees by  the river side, a large white old sow lying on the ground, with a litter  of thirty little pigs round her, and this should be a sign to them  where they were to build their city.    By his advice the Trojans coasted round the south of Sicily, instead of  trying to pass the strait between the dreadful Scylla and Charybdis, and  just below Mount Etna an unfortunate man came running down to the beach  begging to be taken in. He was a Greek, who had been left behind when  Ulysses escaped from Polyphemus' cave, and had made his way to the  forests, where he had lived ever since. They had just taken him in when  they saw Cyclops coming down, with a pine tree for a staff, to wash the  burning hollow of his lost eye in the sea, and they rowed off in great  terror.    [Illustration: MOUNT ETNA.]    Poor old Anchises died shortly after, and while his son was still  sorrowing for him, Juno, who hated every Trojan, stirred up a terrible  tempest, which drove the ships to the south, until, just as the sea  began to calm down, they came into a beautiful bay, enclosed by tall  cliffs with woods overhanging them. Here the tired wanderers landed,  and, lighting a fire, AEneas went in quest of food. Coming out of the  forest, they looked down from a hill, and beheld a multitude of people  building a city, raising walls, houses, towers, and temples. Into one of  these temples AEneas entered, and to his amazement he found the walls  sculptured with all the story of the siege of Troy, and all his friends  so perfectly represented, that he burst into tears at the sight.    Just then a beautiful queen, attended by a whole troop of nymphs, came  into the temple. This lady was Dido; her husband, Sichaeus, had been king  of Tyre, till he was murdered by his brother Pygmalion, who meant to  have married her, but she fled from him with a band of faithful Tyrians  and all her husband's treasure, and had landed on the north coast of  Africa. There she begged of the chief of the country as much land as  could be enclosed by a bullock's hide. He granted this readily; and  Dido, cutting the hide into the finest possible strips, managed to  measure off with it ground enough to build the splendid city which she  had named Carthage. She received AEneas most kindly, and took all his men  into her city, hoping to keep them there for ever, and make him her  husband. AEneas himself was so happy there, that he forgot all his plans  and the prophecies he had heard, until Jupiter sent Mercury to rouse him  to fulfil his destiny. He obeyed the call; and Dido was so wretched at  his departure that she caused a great funeral pile to be built, laid  herself on the top, and stabbed herself with AEneas' sword; the pile was  burnt, and the Trojans saw the flame from their ships without knowing  the cause.    [Illustration: CARTHAGE.]    By-and-by AEneas landed at a place in Italy named Cumae. There dwelt one  of the Sybils. These were wondrous virgins whom Apollo had endowed with  deep wisdom; and when AEneas went to consult the Cumaean Sybil, she told  him that he must visit the under-world of Pluto to learn his fate.  First, however, he had to go into a forest, and find there and gather a  golden bough, which he was to bear in his hand to keep him safe. Long  he sought it, until two doves, his mother's birds, came flying before  him to show him the tree where gold gleamed through the boughs, and he  found the branch growing on the tree as mistletoe grows on the thorn.    Guarded with this, and guided by the Sybil, after a great sacrifice,  AEneas passed into a gloomy cave, where he came to the river Styx, round  which flitted all the shades who had never received funeral rites, and  whom the ferryman, Charon, would not carry over. The Sybil, however,  made him take AEneas across, his boat groaning under the weight of a  human body. On the other side stood Cerberus, but the Sybil threw him a  cake of honey and of some opiate, and he lay asleep, while AEneas passed  on and found in myrtle groves all who had died for love, among them, to  his surprise, poor forsaken Dido. A little further on he found the home  of the warriors, and held converse with his old Trojan friends. He  passed by the place of doom for the wicked, Tartarus; and in the Elysian  fields, full of laurel groves and meads of asphodel, he found the spirit  of his father Anchises, and with him was allowed to see the souls of all  their descendants, as yet unborn, who should raise the glory of their  name. They are described on to the very time when the poet wrote to  whom we owe all the tale of the wanderings of AEneas, namely, Virgil, who  wrote the _AEneid_, whence all these stories are taken. He further tells  us that AEneas landed in Italy just as his old nurse Caieta died, at the  place which is still called Gaeta. After they had buried her, they found  a grove, where they sat down on the grass to eat, using large round  cakes or biscuits to put their meat on. Presently they came to eating up  the cakes. Little Ascanius cried out, \"We are eating our very tables;\"  and AEneas, remembering the harpy's words, knew that his wanderings were  over.    [Illustration: ROMAN SOLDIER.]          CHAPTER III.    THE FOUNDING OF ROME.    B.C. 753--713.      Virgil goes on to tell at much length how the king of the country,  Latinus, at first made friends with AEneas, and promised him his daughter  Lavinia in marriage; but Turnus, an Italian chief who had before been a  suitor to Lavinia, stirred up a great war, and was only captured and  killed after much hard fighting. However, the white sow was found in the  right place with all her little pigs, and on the spot was founded the  city of Alba Longa, where AEneas and Lavinia reigned until he died, and  his descendants, through his two sons, Ascanius or Iulus, and AEneas  Silvius, reigned after him for fifteen generations.    The last of these fifteen was Amulius, who took the throne from his  brother Numitor, who had a daughter named Rhea Silvia, a Vestal virgin.  In Greece, the sacred fire of the goddess Vesta was tended by good men,  but in Italy it was the charge of maidens, who were treated with great  honor, but were never allowed to marry under pain of death. So there was  great anger when Rhea Silvia became the mother of twin boys, and,  moreover, said that her husband was the god Mars. But Mars did not save  her from being buried alive, while the two babes were put in a trough on  the waters of the river Tiber, there to perish. The river had overflowed  its banks, and left the children on dry ground, where, however, they  were found by a she-wolf, who fondled and fed them like her own  offspring, until a shepherd met with them and took them home to his  wife. She called them Romulus and Remus, and bred them up as shepherds.    When the twin brothers were growing into manhood, there was a fight  between the shepherds of Numitor and Amulius, in which Romulus and Remus  did such brave feats that they were led before Numitor.

ZANZIBAR, _28th January, 1866._--After a passage of twenty-three days  from Bombay we arrived at this island in the _Thule_, which was one of  Captain Sherard Osborne's late Chinese fleet, and now a present from  the Bombay Government to the Sultan of Zanzibar. I was honoured with  the commission to make the formal presentation, and this was intended  by H.E. the Governor-in-Council to show in how much estimation I was  held, and thereby induce the Sultan to forward my enterprise. The  letter to his Highness was a commendatory epistle in my favour, for  which consideration on the part of Sir Bartle Frere I feel deeply  grateful. It runs as follows:--        TO HIS HIGHNESS SEJUEL MAJID, SULTAN OF ZANZIBAR.        (_Copy._)        \"YOUR HIGHNESS,--I trust that this will find you in the      enjoyment of health and happiness.        \"I have requested my friend, Dr. David Livingstone, who is      already personally well and favourably known to your Highness,      to convey to you the assurance of the continual friendship and      goodwill of Her Majesty's Government in India.        \"Your Highness is already aware of the benevolent objects of Dr.      Livingstone's life and labours, and I feel assured that your      Highness will continue to him the favour and protection which      you have already shown to him on former occasions, and that your      Highness will direct every aid to be given him within your      Highness's dominions which may tend to further the philanthropic      designs to which he has devoted himself, and which, as your      Highness is aware, are viewed with the warmest interest by Her      Majesty's Government both in India and England.        \"I trust your Highness will favour me with continued accounts of      your good health and welfare.        \"I remain, your Highness's sincere friend,        (Signed) \"H.B.E. FRERE.        \"BOMBAY CASTLE, _2nd January, 1866._\"    When we arrived Dr. Seward, the Acting Consul, was absent at the  Seychelles on account of serious failure of health: Mr. Schultz,  however, was representing him, but he too was at the time away. Dr.  Seward was expected back daily, and he did arrive on the 31st. I  requested a private interview with the Sultan, and on the following  day (29th) called and told him the nature of my commission to his  Highness. He was very gracious, and seemed pleased with the gift, as  well he might, for the _Thule_ is fitted up in the most gorgeous  manner. We asked a few days to put her in perfect order, and this  being the Ramadan, or fasting month, he was all the more willing to  defer a visit to the vessel.    Dr. Seward arranged to have an audience with the Sultan, to carry out  his instructions, which were to present me in a formal manner; Captain  Bradshaw of the _Wasp_, with Captain Leatham of the _Vigilant_, and  Bishop Tozer, were to accompany us in full dress, but the Sultan had a  toothache and gumboil, and could not receive us; he, however, placed  one of his houses at my disposal, and appointed a man who speaks  English to furnish board for my men and me, and also for Captain  Brebner, of the _Thule_, and his men.    [Illustration: Livingstone's House, Zanzibar.]    _6th February, 1866._--The Sultan being still unable to come, partly  on account of toothache and partly on account of Ramadan, he sent his  commodore, Captain Abdullah, to receive the _Thule_. When the English  flag was hauled down in the _Thule_, it went up to the mainmast of the  _Iskander Shah_, and was saluted by twenty-one guns; then the _Wasp_  saluted the Arab flag with an equal number, which honour being duly  acknowledged by a second royal salute from the _Iskander Shah_,  Captain Abdullah's frigate, the ceremony ended.    Next day, the 7th, we were received by the Sultan, and through his  interpreter, I told him that his friend, the Governor of Bombay, had  lately visited the South Mahratta Princes, and had pressed on them the  necessity of education; the world was moving on, and those who  neglected to acquire knowledge would soon find that power slipped  through their fingers, and that the Bombay Government, in presenting  his Highness with a portion of steam power, showed its desire to  impart one of the greatest improvements of modern times, not desiring  to monopolize power, but hoping to"]]]
