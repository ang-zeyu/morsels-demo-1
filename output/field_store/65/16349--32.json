Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50;  tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 10.--Insertion worked in Tatting.]    This strip of insertion is worked with two cottons. Work with the cotton  in the left hand over that in the right hand. Both ends of cotton are  fastened together at the beginning by a knot. First work one half of the  insertion the long way in the following manner:--1 plain, 1 purl, 1  plain (the purl must be very short); turn the purl downwards, 6 double,  1 purl, * 6 double, 1 purl, 1 plain, which must all be turned upwards;  then turn the work so that the upper edge is turned downwards; work 6  double, fastened on to the last purl turned downwards (the fastening of  the stitches is made with the thread in the right hand); a loop turned  upwards is thus formed; turn the work downwards, draw the cotton in  right hand underneath that in left hand, and work 6 double, 1 purl, 6  double, all turned upwards; fasten these stitches on 1st purl turned  downwards. In this pattern 1st of border pattern is thus completed;  turn it downwards, 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double, 1 purl, 1 plain, turn  work downwards, 6 double, fastened on last purl of last pattern, turned  up. Repeat from *. When the insertion is of sufficient length, work the  other half in same manner, and fasten it on the 1st half by means of  purl stitches between the 8 double stitches twice repeated.           *       *       *       *       *    11.--_Tatted Insertion for Trimming Lingeries_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40, or  crochet cotton No. 20; tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 11.--Tatted Insertion.]    This insertion consists of 2 rows of three-branched patterns which lie  opposite each other, and are joined by slanting rows of knots. A  coloured silk ribbon is drawn through these rows which join the  patterns. Each of the 3 branches of 1 pattern consists of 9 double, 1  purl, 9 double, and must be worked close to another. When the 3rd branch  is completed, fasten another piece of cotton on to the middle branch.  Work 12 double over this 2nd piece of cotton, and then work without the  2nd piece of cotton a 2nd three-branched pattern like the 1st.* Fasten  the 2nd piece of cotton on to the middle branch of the just-finished  pattern, work 12 double over it, then again a three-branched pattern;  in this pattern as well as in the following ones, instead of working the  purl of the 1st branch, fasten it on to the purl of the 3rd branch of  the preceding three-branched pattern of the _same_ row, as can be seen  in illustration. Repeat till the strip of insertion is sufficiently  long.           *       *       *       *       *    12.--_Circle in Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 80;  tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 12.--Circle in Tatting.]    Work first 8 ovals, each composed of 5 double stitches, 3 purl divided  one from the other by 4 double stitches, 5 double stitches; these ovals  are joined together by the purl at the sides, then the circle is  tightened as much as possible, and the cotton with which you are working  is twisted round the ends of cotton that have been cut: the cotton is  then fastened off nearly underneath.    Begin a fresh small oval, composed of 12 double stitches, which should  be fastened to the preceding oval after 3 double stitches (to the purl  in the centre of the first oval), then fasten it again to the purl which  joins together the first and the second oval; leave a space of about  one-fourth of an inch, and work an oval composed of 4 double stitches, 5  purl, followed each by 2 double stitches, 4 double stitches. A very  little farther off make a very small oval, composed of 8 double  stitches, which after the four first double stitches is joined to the  centre purl of the second oval, leaving the same space between as  before, make another oval of 4 double stitches, 5 purl, each followed by  2 double stitches, 4 double stitches; but the first purl is _missed_,  because at this place the oval is joined to the fifth purl of the  corresponding oval; once more leave a space of one-fourth of an inch,  and repeat. At the end of the round the two ends of cotton are tied  tightly together.           *       *       *       *       *    13.--_Tatted Border with Beads_.    Materials: Black purse silk, or, for white trimming, Messrs. Walter  Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 2; tatting-pin No. 3; 3 hanks of  beads No. 4 to the yard of border.    [Illustration: 13.--Tatted Border with Beads.]    This border, edged with beads No. 4, is worked in middling-size purse  silk over fine silk cord of the same colour as the silk. Before  beginning to work this pattern, thread the beads which take the place of  purl stitches, and which are slipped in between two double stitches.  When the row of stitches is of the length required, form the trefoil  leaves, and sew a few beads over the places where they are joined. These  trefoil leaves are made separately, and then sewn together.           *       *       *       *       *    14.--_Insertion in Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton No. 10;  tatting-pin No. 3; any sized shuttle; for a finer insertion No. 18 or  20.    [Illustration: 14.--Insertion in Tatting.]    1st oval: Fill the shuttle, but do not cut it off from the reel, as a  double thread is used, and commence by working 10 double stitches, 1  purl, 10 double, draw up.    Double thread: Putting the thread attached to  the reel round the left hand, work 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double.    2nd oval: 10 double, join to purl of 1st oval, 10 double, draw up.  Repeat till the length required is worked, then cut off.    For the fresh length, which will make the other half of the insertion,  the shuttle must still be attached to the reel. Commence by working--    1st oval: 10 double, join to the purl which connects the first and  second ovals of the piece already worked, 10 double, draw up. Double  thread: 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double.    2nd oval: 10 double, join to the same purl as last--namely, the one  connecting the first and second ovals of the piece already worked, 10  double, draw up. Repeat, joining the two next ovals to the purl which  connects the two next in the piece already worked, and so on.    Crochet a heading each side, working 7 chain, 1 double into the purl of  double thread, repeat. With a heading on one side only, this makes a  pretty wide edging.           *       *       *       *       *    15.--_Border in Tatting and Crochet_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40, and  crochet cotton No. 80; tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 15.--Border in Tatting and Crochet.]    This lace is rendered stronger by the crochet rows of scallops and  treble stitch round the edge. Begin with the tatting as follows: Make a  circle of 8 double, 7 purl divided by 2 double, 8 double. This circle is  repeated at a distance of about three-fourths of an inch, only instead  of the 1st purl each following circle must be fastened on to the last  purl of the preceding circle. Then take some crochet cotton, which must  be finer than the cotton used for tatting, and work a row of double  stitches over the thread which joins the circles. The number of stitches  depends on the length and size of the cotton; work double stitches round  the circles at the place where both ends meet. The outer row consists of  treble "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15154"],[0,"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (#3)"],[1,"settle whether the end in  itself is desirable. Often the end may be a matter of course for every  reasonable being. The extreme case is presented by the applied science  of medicine, where the physician subordinates all his technique to the  end of curing the patient. Yet if we are consistent we must  acknowledge that all his medical knowledge can prescribe to him only  that he proceed in a certain way if the long life of the patient is  acknowledged as a desirable end. The application of anatomy,  physiology, and pathology may just as well be used for the opposite  end of killing a man. Whether it is wise to work toward long life, or  whether it is better to kill people, is again a problem which lies  outside the sphere of the applied sciences. Ethics or social  philosophy or religion have to solve these preliminary' questions. The  physician as such has only to deal with the means which lead toward  that goal.    We must make the same discrimination in the psychotechnical field. The  psychologist may point out the methods by which an involuntary  confession can be secured from a defendant, but whether it is  justifiable to extort involuntary confessions is a problem which does  not concern the psychologist. The lawyers or the legislators must  decide as to the right or wrong, the legality or illegality, of  forcing a man to show his bidden ideas. If such an end is desirable,  the psychotechnical student can determine the right means, and that is  the limit of his office. We ought to keep in mind that the same holds  true for the application of psychology in economic life. Economic  psychotechnics may serve certain ends of commerce and industry, but  whether these ends are the best ones is not a care with which the  psychologist has to be burdened. For instance, the end may be the  selection of the most efficient laborers for particular industries.  The psychologist may develop methods in his laboratory by which this  purpose can be fulfilled. But if some mills prefer another goal,--for  instance, to have not the most efficient but the cheapest possible  laborers,--entirely different means for the selection are necessary.  The psychologist is, therefore, not entangled in the economic  discussions of the day; it is not his concern to decide whether the  policy of the trusts or the policy of the trade-unions or any other  policy for the selection of laborers is the ideal one. He is confined  to the statement; if you wish this end, then you must proceed in this  way; but it is left to you to express your preference among the ends.  Applied psychology can, therefore, speak the language of an exact  science in its own field, independent of economic opinions and  debatable partisan interests. This is necessary limitation, but in  this limitation lies the strength of the new science. The psychologist  may show how a special commodity can be advertised; but whether from a  social point of view it is desirable to reinforce the sale of these  goods is no problem for psychotechnics. If a sociologist insists that  it would be better if not so many useless goods were bought, and that  the aim ought rather to be to protect the buyer than to help the  seller, the psychologist would not object. His interest would only be  to find the right psychological means to lead to this other social  end. He is partisan neither of the salesman nor of the customer,  neither of the capitalist nor of the laborer, he is neither Socialist  nor anti-Socialist, neither high-tariff man nor free-trader. Here,  too, of course, there are certain goals which are acknowledged on all  sides, and which therefore hardly need any discussion, just as in the  case of the physician, where the prolongation of life is practically  acknowledged as a desirable end by every one. But everywhere where the  aim is not perfectly a matter of course, the psychotechnical  specialist fulfills his task only when he is satisfied with  demonstrating that certain psychical means serve a certain end, and  that they ought to be applied as soon as that end is accepted.    The whole system of psychotechnical knowledge might be subdivided  under either of the two aspects. Either we might start from the  various mental processes and ask for what end each mental factor can  be practically useful and important, or we can begin with studying  what significant ends are acknowledged in our society and then we can  seek the various psychological facts which are needed as means for the  realization of these ends. The first way offers many conveniences.  There we should begin with the mental states of attention, memory,  feeling, and so on, and should study how the psychological knowledge  of every one of these mental states can render service in many  different practical fields. The attention, for instance, is important  in the classroom when the teacher tries to secure the attention of the  pupils, but the judge expects the same attention from the jurymen in  the courtroom, the artist seeks to stir up the attention of the  spectator, the advertiser demands the attention of the newspaper  readers. Whoever studies the characteristics of the mental process of  attention may then be able to indicate how in every one of these  unlike cases the attention can be stimulated and retained.  Nevertheless the opposite way which starts from the tasks to be  fulfilled seems more helpful and more fundamentally significant. The  question, then, is what mental processes become important for the  tasks of education, what for the purposes of the courtroom, what for  the hospital, what for the church, what for politics, and so on.    As this whole essay is to be devoted exclusively to the economic  problems, we are obliged to choose the second way; that is, to arrange  applied psychology with reference to its chief ends and not with  reference to the various means. But the same question comes up in the  further subdivision of the material. In the field of economic  psychology, too, we might ask how far the study of attention, or of  perception, or of feeling, or of will, or of memory, and so on, can be  useful for the purposes of the business man. Or here, too, we might  begin with the consideration of the various ends and purposes. The  ends of commerce are different from those of industry, those of  publishing different from those of transportation, those of  agriculture different from those of mining; or, in the field of  commerce, the purposes of the retailer are different from those of the  wholesale merchant. There can be no limit to such subdivisions; each  particular industry has its own aims, and in the same industry a large  variety of tasks are united. We should accordingly be led to an ample  classification of special economic ends with pigeonholes for every  possible kind of business and of labor. The psychologist would have to  find for every one of these ends the right mental means. This would be  the ideal system of economic psychology.    But we are still endlessly far from such a perfect system. Modern  educational psychology and medical psychology have reached a stage at  which an effort for such a complete system might be realized, but  economic psychology is still at too early a stage of development. It  would be entirely artificial to-day to aim at such ideal completeness.  If we were to construct such a complete system of questions, we should  have no answers. In the present stage nothing can be seriously  proposed but the selection of a few central purposes which occur in  every department of business life, and a study of the means to reach  these special ends by the discussion of some typical cases which may  clearly illustrate the methods involved.    From this point of view we select three chief purposes of business  life, purposes which are important in commerce and industry and every  economic endeavor. We ask how we can find the men whose mental  qualities make them best fitted for the work which they have to do;  secondly, under what psychological conditions we can secure the  greatest and most satisfactory output of work from every man; and  finally, how we can produce most completely the influences on human  minds which are desired in the interest of business. In other words,  we ask how to find the best possible man, how to produce the best  possible work, and how to secure the best possible effects.          PART I    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN          IV    VOCATION AND FITNESS      Instead of lingering over theoretical discussions, we will move  straight on toward our first practical problem. The economic task,  with reference to which we want to demonstrate the new psychotechnic  method, is the selection of those personalities which by their mental  qualities are especially fit for a particular kind of economic work.  This problem is especially useful to show what the new method can do  and what it cannot do. Whether the method is sufficiently developed to  secure full results to-day, or whether they will come to-morrow, is  unimportant. It is clear that the success of to-morrow is to be hoped  for, only if understanding and interest in the problem is already  alive to-day.    When we inquire into the qualities of men, we use the word here in its  widest meaning. It covers, on the one side, the mental dispositions  which may still be quite undeveloped and which may unfold only under  the influence of special conditions in the surroundings; but, on the  other side, it covers the habitual traits of the personality, the  features of the individual temperament and character, of the  intelligence and of the ability, of the collected knowledge and of the  acquired experience. All variations of will and feeling, of perception  and thought, of attention and emotion, of memory and imagination, are  included here. From a purely psychological standpoint, quite  incomparable contents and functions and dispositions of the  personality are thus thrown together, but in practical"]]]
