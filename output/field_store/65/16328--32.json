I wonder at your choice.\"    \"But you don't object, papa?\"    \"No, if I must give you away--and I've always known that would come some  time--I would rather it should be to him than any one else, for I can  never doubt that he will be tender and true to my precious one, when she  leaves her father's home for his.\"    \"Papa, papa, don't speak of it,\" she cried, winding her arms about his  neck, \"I can't bear to think of it; that our home will no longer be the  same, that I can't come to you every night and be folded to your heart as  I have been ever since I was a little girl.\"    \"Well, dearest,\" he said, after a moment, in which he held her very close  and caressed her with exceeding tenderness, \"we shall not be far apart or  miss passing some time together many days of the year. And you are not in  haste to leave me?\"    \"Oh, no, no! why should I be? Please keep me a little while yet.\"    \"I intend to: it will take at least a year to get used to the thought of  doing without you, and so long Travilla must be content to wait. Nor can  we give you up wholly even then; your suite of rooms shall still be yours,  and you must come now and then and occupy them for days or weeks at a  time.    \"Now, daughter, good-night. Come to me to-morrow morning in my study, soon  after breakfast, I have something more of importance to say to you.\"    \"I shall obey, and without fear,\" she answered gayly, \"though I remember  once being quite frightened at a similar order; but that was when I was a  silly little girl and didn't know how dearly my own papa loved me.\"    \"And when he was strangely stern to his own little child,\" he answered,  with another tender caress.          CHAPTER THIRD.        \"So fair that had you beauty's picture took,       It must like her, or not like beauty look.\"                            --ALLEYN'S HENRY VII.      Elsie paused at the half-open door of her father's private room.    Mr. Dinsmore, like most men, was fond of light and air; through the wide  open windows the morning breeze stole softly in, laden with sweets from  garden and lawn, and the rich carpet of oak and green was flecked with  gold where the sunbeams came shimmering down between the fluttering leaves  of a beautiful vine that had festooned itself about the one looking to the  east.    Mr. Dinsmore was seated at his desk with a pile of papers before  him--legal documents in appearance; he would open one, glance over its  contents, lay it aside, and take up another only to treat it in like  manner.    Elsie stood but a moment watching him with loving, admiring eyes, then  gliding noiselessly across the floor, dropped gracefully at his feet and  laying her folded hands upon his knee looked up into his face with an  arch, sweet smile.    \"Mon pere, I have come for my lecture, or whatever you have laid up in  store for me,\" she announced with mock gravity and a slight tremble of  pretended fear in her voice.    Dropping the paper he held, and passing one hand caressingly over her  shining hair, \"My darling, how very, very lovely you are!\" he said, the  words bursting spontaneously from his lips; \"there is no flaw in your  beauty, and your face beams with happiness.\"    \"Papa turned flatterer!\" she cried, springing up and allowing him to draw  her to his knee.    \"I'm waiting for the lecture,\" she said presently, \"you know I always like  to have disagreeable things over as soon as possible.\"    \"Who told you there was to be a lecture?\"    \"Nobody, sir.\"    \"What have you been doing that you feel entitles you to one?\"    \"I don't remember.\"    \"Nor I either. So let us to business. Here, take this chair beside me. Do  you know how much you are worth?\"    \"Not precisely, sir,\" she answered demurely, taking the chair and folding  her hands pensively in her lap; \"but very little, I presume, since you  have given me away for nothing.\"    \"By no means,\" he said, with a slight smile of amusement at her unwonted  mood. \"It was for your own happiness, which is no trifle in my esteem. But  you belong to me still.\"    She looked at him with glistening eyes. \"Thank you, dearest papa; yes, I  do belong to you and always shall. Please excuse my wilful  misunderstanding of your query. I do not know how much money and other  property I own, but have an idea it is a million more or less.\"    \"My dear child!--it is fully three times that.\"    \"Papa! is it indeed?\"    \"Yes, it was about a million at the time of your Grandfather Grayson's  death, and has increased very much during your mamma's minority and yours;  which you know has been a very long one. You own several stores and a  dwelling house in New Orleans, a fine plantation with between two and  three hundred negroes, and I have invested largely for you in stocks of  various kinds both in your own country and in England. I wish you to  examine all the papers, certificates of stock, bonds, deeds, mortgages,  and so forth.\"    \"Oh, papa!\" she cried, lifting her hands in dismay, \"what a task. Please  excuse me. You know all about it, and is not that sufficient?\"    \"No, the property is yours; I have been only your steward, and must now  render up an account to you for the way in which I have handled your  property.\"    \"You render an account to _me_, my own dear father,\" she said low and  tremulously, while her face flushed crimson; \"I cannot bear to hear you  speak so. I am fully satisfied, and very, _very_ thankful for all your  kind care of it and of me.\"    He regarded her with a smile of mingled tenderness and amusement, while  softly patting and stroking the small white hand laid lovingly upon his.    \"Could I--could any father--do less for his own beloved child?\" he asked.    \"Not you, I know, papa. But may I ask you a question?\"    \"As many as you like.\"    \"How much are you worth? Ah! you needn't look so quizzical. I mean how  much do you own in money, land, etc.?\"    \"Something less than a million; I cannot tell you the exact number of  dollars and cents.\"    \"Hardly a third as much as I! It doesn't seem right. Papa, take half of  mine.\"    \"That wouldn't balance the scales either,\" he said laughingly; \"and  besides, Mr. Travilla has now some right to be consulted.\"    \"Papa, I could never love him again, if he should object to my giving you  all but a few hundred thousands.\"    \"He would not. He says he will never touch a cent of your property; it  must be settled entirely upon yourself, and subject to your control. And  that is quite right; for he, too, is wealthy.\"    \"Papa, I don't think I deserve so much; I don't want the care of so much.  I do wish you would be so good as to take half for your own, and continue  to manage the other half for me as you think best.\"    \"What you deserve is not the question just now. This is one of the talents  which God has given you, and I think you ought, at least for the present,  to keep the principal and decide for yourself what shall be done with the  interest. You are old enough now to do so, and I hope do not wish to shirk  the responsibility, since God, in His good providence, has laid it upon  you.\"    He spoke very gravely and Elsie's face reflected the expression of his.    \"No, I do not wish it now, papa,\" she said, in a low, sweet voice. \"I  will undertake it, asking Him for wisdom and grace to do it aright.\"    They were busy for the next hour or two over the papers.    \"There!\" cried Elsie, at length, \"we have examined the last one, and I  think I understand it all pretty thoroughly.\"    \"I think you do. And now another thing; ought you not to go and see for  yourself your property in Louisiana?\"    Elsie assented, on condition that he would take her.    \"Certainly, my dear child, can you suppose I would ever think of  permitting you to go alone?\"    \"Thank you, papa. And if poor mammy objects this time, she may take her  choice of going or staying; but go I must, and see how my poor people are  faring at Viamede. I have dim, dreamy recollections of it as a kind of  earthly paradise. Papa, do you know why mammy has always been so  distressed whenever I talked of going there?\"    \"Painful associations, no doubt. Poor creature! it was there her  husband--an unruly negro belonging to a neighboring planter--was sold away  from her, and there she lost her children, one by accidental drowning, the  others by some epidemic disease. Your own mother, too, died there, and  Chloe I think never loved one of her own children better.\"    \"No, I'm sure not. But she never told me of her husband and children, and  I thought she had never had any. And now, papa, that we are done with  business for the present, I have a request to make.\"    \"Well, daughter, what is it?\"    \"That you will permit me to renew my old intimacy with Lucy Carrington; or  at least to call on her. You remember she was not well enough to be at the  wedding; she is here at Ashlands with her baby. Mr. and Mrs. Carrington  called here yesterday while you were out, and both urged me not to be  ceremonious with Lucy, as she is hardly well enough to make calls and is  longing to see me.\"    \"And what answer did you give them?\" he asked with some curiosity.    \"That I should do so if possible; that meant if I could obtain your  permission, papa.\"    \"You have it. Lucy is in some sort taken into the family now, and you are  safely engaged; to say nothing of your mature years,\" he added laughingly,  as she seated herself on his knee again and thanked him with a hug and  kiss.    \"You dear good papa!\"    \"Some girls of your age, heiresses in their own right, would merely have  said, 'I'm going,' never asking permission.\"    \"Ah, but I like to be ruled by you. So please don't give it up. Now about  Enna?\"    \"If I had any authority in the matter, I should say, you shall not give  her a cent. She doesn't deserve it from you or any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#3)"],[1," haste. She gained the landing, caught her  heel in the carpet on the first step of the next flight, and a wild shriek  rang through the house, accompanied by the sound of a heavy body tumbling  and rolling down the stairs.    Echoing the scream, Enna rushed out into the upper hall.    Calhoun at the foot of the stairs, was picking Molly up.    \"Is she hurt? Is she killed?\" asked the mother, \"Molly, Molly, how did you  come to be so awkward?\"    \"I wasn't! it was those heels; I knew they'd throw me down some day!\"  cried the child in tones of mingled anger, fright and pain.    \"H'm! you're not killed; haven't even had the temper knocked out of you,\"  remarked Enna, going back to her dressing.    \"Poor child, you must be hurt,\" said Calhoun, laying her gently on a sofa,  \"but no bones broken, I hope?\"    \"I--I don't know,\" sobbed Molly, \"it's my back. Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"    \"Oh, Molly, are you much hurt? shall I go for the doctor?\" asked Dick,  coming to her side pale with fright. \"Mac's right here at the door, ready  saddled and bridled, and----\"    \"Go for the doctor?\" interrupted Molly. \"No, indeed! It's very good in  you, Dick, but I don't want him; I am going to Ion with the rest of you.  I'm ready now.\"    \"You don't look much like it; you're as pale as a ghost,\" he said, Calhoun  adding, \"You'd better lie still for a while, Molly; Dick or I will take  you over this evening, if you find yourself able to go then.\"    \"Thank you, but I'm going now,\" she answered with decision, getting up and  taking Dick's arm.    He helped her to the carriage, where Isadore, Virginia, and some of the  younger ones sat waiting, and placed her in it.    She wiped away her tears and tried to smile, while answering the questions  and condolences of the others, and the party moved on.    By the time Ion was reached, most of them had nearly forgotten Molly's  accident, till Elsie remarked that she was looking pale, and asked if she  were quite well.    That brought out the story of her fall.    Elsie heard it with grave concern but asked few questions as Molly seemed  annoyed that the subject had been introduced. It was a habit of her  mother's to scold her for awkwardness, and the child was sensitive on that  point.    When the young people had left and the older members of the Roselands  family called, Elsie seized a favorable opportunity to speak of Molly's  pale looks and urge the importance of calling in a physician that if there  were any reason to apprehend serious results from the fall, measures might  be promptly taken to avert the danger.    \"She can't have been seriously hurt,\" returned Enna coldly, \"or she  wouldn't have been ready to get into the carriage the next minute and ride  over here.\"    \"By the way,\" said her father, \"I haven't heard what caused her fall.\"    \"She's an awkward child, always tumbling about,\" returned Enna reddening.    \"Especially since she wears those fashionable boots with the high narrow  heels,\" he remarked. \"Had she them on when she fell?\"    Enna reluctantly admitted that such was the fact.    \"I'll send them into town to-day, with orders that full half the heel  shall be taken off,\" he said with angry decision.          CHAPTER THIRD.                          \"'Tis a goodly scene--      Yon river, like a silvery snake, lays out      His coil i' the sunshine lovingly.\"                                  --HUNT.      The family at Ion presently fell into the old routine of study, work and  play, Elsie resuming the duties of governess; but as the heated term drew  on, she and the little ones, especially the babe, began to droop.    \"You must go north for the summer,\" said Dr. Barton, \"start as soon as  possible and don't return till October.\"    \"Would you recommend the seashore?\" asked Mr. Travilla.    \"H'm! that might answer very well, but mountain air would, I think, be  better.\"    \"Oh then, mamma!\" cried Vi, who was present and had been an eager but  hitherto silent listener, \"won't you accept Aunt Lucy's invitation?\"    \"Perhaps, daughter,\" Elsie said smiling indulgently into the bright little  face, \"but we will take time to consider what will be best.\"    \"Where is that?\" asked the doctor, \"Lucy Ross, I suppose, but I've  forgotten where they live.\"    \"On the banks of the Hudson a few miles south of Newburgh. The Crags they  call their place, and a beautiful one it is. 'Twas only yesterday I  received a letter from Lucy, urging us to come and spend the summer with  her.\"    \"I should say go by all means,\" said the doctor, taking leave.    There were reasons for hesitation on the part of the careful parents of  which the physician knew nothing. The young Rosses, all unused to control,  were a willful set not likely to exert a beneficial influence over other  children; that was the demur.    However the final decision was in favor of the visit, and a few days later  they set out upon their journey; Mr. Horace Dinsmore taking charge of  them, as business made it inconvenient for Mr. Travilla to leave just at  that time.    From New York they passed up the Hudson in a steamboat; the carriage from  the Crags was found in waiting at the landing, and a short drive brought  them to the house, which stood high up above the river, in the midst of  magnificent mountain scenery.    The Ion children, taught from early infancy to notice the beauties of  nature, were in ecstasies of delight, exclaiming anew at every turn in the  road, calling each other's, mamma's or grandpa's attention to the  sparkling river, the changing shadows on the mountainsides, here a  beetling crag, there a waterfall or secluded glen. Having rested the  previous night, sleeping soundly at a hotel, they were not wearied with  travel but seemed fresher now than when they left their home.    Lucy and her little flock, gathered on the front porch to receive their  guests, gave them a warm welcome. The two ladies had lost none of the  affection for each other which had been one of the happinesses of their  childhood and early youth, and each loved the children of the other for  the mother's sake if not for their own. They numbered the same, but  Sophie, Lucy's youngest, was now in her fifth year, and Baby Lily was  greeted with many expressions and demonstrations of delight.    Lucy excused her husband's absence: he was away on business, she said, but  would be at home before night.    \"Where's Phil?\" asked Eddie, turning to Gertrude.    \"Oh, he's at boarding-school, don't you know?\" she answered. \"He'll be  home in vacation; but that doesn't begin for two weeks yet.\"    Mr. Dinsmore tarried for a few days, then returned to the neighborhood of  Philadelphia, where he had left his wife and Rosie, who were visiting  their northern relatives.    Miss Fisk was still governess at the Crags, and when the children had had  a week of play together, it was thought best by the mammas, that two hours  of each morning should be devoted to lessons.    Knowing Miss Fisk to be not only well educated and refined, but also a  conscientious and good woman, Elsie was willing to entrust her children to  her care; the more so, because Lily in her feeble state, required much of  her own time and attention.    In the midst of a beautiful grove of oaks and maples, on the side of a  hill, scarce more than a stone's throw from the mansion, and within full  view of its windows, stood a small brick building owned by Mr. Ross, and  used as a summer schoolroom for the children.    It was a cool shady spot, enlivened by the songs of the wild birds who  built their nests in the trees, and the musical tinkle of a little  waterfall that came tumbling down from the heights above not half-a-dozen  yards from the door.    Mr. Ross had furnished the room with comfortable and convenient chairs and  desks, and Lucy had made it pretty and tasteful with white muslin curtains  and neatly papered walls of a soft neutral tint, enlivened by a few gayly  colored pictures. Woodwork and floor were stained a rich dark brown,  bright soft rugs were scattered here and there; and altogether the place  was as inviting as a lady's parlor.    The Ion children were well content to spend here two or three hours of  that part of the day when the sun was too hot for them to be exposed to  his rays with safety and comfort: the others found lessons made much more  agreeable by the companionship of their young guests, and Miss Fisk was  glad to take them under her charge, because by their intelligence they  added greatly to the interest of her work, while their respectful obedient  behavior exerted an excellent influence upon her other pupils.    Before leaving home, Elsie, after careful and prayerful consideration,  thought it best to have a plain talk with her older children about the  temptations that were likely to assail them during their visit to the  Crags.    They had had some past experience of the ways of Lucy's children, and she  knew they had not forgotten it; and reminding them of the Bible  declaration, that \"evil communications corrupt good manners,\" she bade  them, while refraining as far as possible from judging their little  friends, at the same time to carefully avoid following their example in  anything they knew to be wrong.    \"Mamma,\" said Vi, \"perhaps sometimes we mightn't know if it was wrong!\"    \"I think you will, daughter, if you take a moment to think; and if you are  doubtful, you may be pretty sure it is wrong.\"    \"Mamma, we mustn't tell tales to you?\"    \"No, dear; but perhaps you can consult me without that; and do not forget  that you can always lift up your heart to God for help to know and do the  right.\"    \"Yes, mamma,\" returned the little girl thoughtfully, \"and I do believe  Elsie will 'most always be there and know what's right.\"    \"I'm not sure,\" said her sister, with a grave shake of the head, \"I wish  we could always have mamma by to tell us.\"    \"But mamma cannot be with you always, darlings,\" Elsie said, regarding  them with yearning"]]]
