The Ringed seal is locally called  \"floe rat\" and \"gum seal.\" It is the smallest and least valuable of  all, and fairly common all round. The Harp seal is \"seal,\" in the same  way as cod is \"fish.\" It has various local names, five among the  French-Canadians alone, but is specifically known as the Greenland  seal. The young, immediately after birth, have a fine white coat,  which makes them valuable. The herds are followed on a large scale at  the end of the winter season, which is also the whelping season, and  hundreds of thousands are killed, females and young preponderating.  They are still common along the east and south, but diminishing  steadily, especially in the St. Lawrence. The Bearded, or  \"Square-flipper,\" seal is rare in the St. Lawrence and on the  Atlantic, but commoner in Hudsonian waters. It is a large seal, eight  feet long, and bulky in proportion. The Grey, or Horse-head, seal  runs up to about the same size occasionally and is one of the gamest  animals that swims. It is rare on the Atlantic and not common anywhere  on the St. Lawrence. The \"Hoods\" are the largest of all and the lions  of the lot. They run up to 1,000 pounds and over, and sometimes  fourteen feet long. They are rare on the Atlantic and decreasing along  the St. Lawrence, owing to the Newfoundland hunters. The Walrus,  formerly abundant all round, is now rarely seen except in the far  north, where he is fast decreasing.    Moose may feel their way in by the southwest to an increasing extent,  and might possibly be reinforced by the Alaskan variety. Red deer  might possibly be induced to enter by the same way in fair numbers  over a limited area. The woodland caribou is almost exterminated, but  might be resuscitated. The barren-ground caribou is still plentiful in  the north, where most of the herds appear to migrate in an immense  ellipse, crossing from west to east, over the barrens, in the fall, to  the Atlantic, and then turning south and west through the woods in  winter, till they reach their original starting-point near Hudson bay  in the spring. But this is not to be counted on. The herds divide,  change direction, and linger in different places. Their tame brother,  the reindeer, is being introduced as the chief domestic animal of  Eastern Labrador, with apparently every prospect of success. Beaver  are fairly common and widely distributed in forested areas. Other  rodents are frequent--squirrels, musk-rats, mice, voles, lemmings,  hares and porcupines. There are two bats. Black bears are general;  polars, in the north. Grizzlies have been traded at Fort Chimo in  Ungava, but they are probably all killed out. The lynx is common  wherever there are woods. There are two wolves, arctic and timber, the  latter now rare in the south. The Labrador red fox is very common in  the woods, and the \"white,\" or arctic fox, in the barrens and further  south on both coasts. The \"cross,\" \"silver\" and \"black\" variations of  course occur, as they naturally increase towards the northern limits  of range. The \"blue\" is a seasonal change of the \"white.\" The  wolverine and otter are common. The skunk is only known in the  southwest. The mink ranges through the southern third of the  peninsula. The Labrador marten, or \"sable,\" is a sub-species,  generally distributed in the forested parts, like the weasel. The  \"fisher,\" or Pennant's marten, is much more local, ranging only  between the \"North Shore\" and Mistassini.    From the St. Lawrence to the Barren Grounds three-fourths of the land  has been burnt over since the white man came. The resultant loss of  all forms of life may be imagined, especially when we remember that  the fire often burns up the very soil itself, leaving nothing but  rocks and black desolation. Still, there is plenty of fur and feather  worth preserving. But nothing can save it unless conservation replaces  the present reckless destruction.      DESTRUCTION    When rich virgin soil is first farmed it yields a maximum harvest for  a minimum of human care. But presently it begins to fail, and will  fail altogether unless man returns to it in one form some of the  richness he expects to get from it in another. Now, exploited wild  life fails even faster under wasteful treatment; but, on the other  hand, with hardly any of the trouble required for continuous farming,  quickly recovers itself by being simply let alone. So when we consider  how easily it can be preserved in Labrador, and how beneficial its  preservation is to all concerned, we can understand how the wanton  destruction going on there is quite as idiotic as it is wrong.    Take \"egging\" as an example. The Indians, Eskimos and other beasts of  prey merely preserved the balance of nature by the toll they used to  take. No beast of prey, not even the white man, will destroy his own  stock supply of food. But with the nineteenth century came the  white-man market \"eggers\", systematically taking or destroying every  egg in every place they visited. Halifax, Quebec and other towns were  centres of the trade. The \"eggers\" increased in numbers and  thoroughness till the eggs decreased in the more accessible spots  below paying quantities. But other egging still goes on unchecked. The  game laws of the province of Quebec distinctly state: \"It is forbidden  to take nests or eggs of wild birds at any time\". But the swarms of  fishermen who come up the north shore of the St. Lawrence egg wherever  they go. If they are only to stay in the same spot for a day or two,  they gather all the eggs they can, put them into water, and throw away  every one that floats. Sometimes three, four, five or even ten times  as many are thrown away as are kept, and all those bird lives lost for  nothing. Worse still, if the men are going to stay long enough they  will often go round the nests and make sure of smashing every single  egg. Then they come back in a few days and gather every single egg,  because they know it has been laid in the mean time and must be  fresh. When we remember how many thousands of men visit the shore, and  that the resident population eggs on its own account, at least as high  up as the Pilgrims, only 100 miles from Quebec, we need not be  prophets to foresee the inevitable end of all bird life when subjected  to such a drain. And this is on the St. Lawrence, where there are laws  and wardens and fewer fishermen. What about the Atlantic Labrador,  where there are no laws, no wardens, many more fishermen, and ruthless  competitive egging between the residents and visitors? Of course,  where people must egg or starve there is nothing more to be said. But  this sort of egging is very limited, not enough to destroy the birds,  and the necessity for it will become less frequent as other sources of  supply become available. It is the utterly wanton destruction that is  the real trouble.    And it is just as bad with the birds as with the eggs. A schooner  captain says, \"Now, boys, here's your butcher shop: help yourselves!\"  and this, remember, is in the brooding season. Not long ago the men  from a vessel in Cross harbour landed on an islet full of eiders and  killed every single brooding mother. Such men have grown up to this,  and there is that amount of excuse for them. Besides, they ate the  birds, though they destroyed the broods. Yet, as they always say, \"We  don't know no law here,\" it may be suspected that they do know there  really is one. These men do a partly excusable wrong. But what about  those who ought to know better? In the summer of 1907 an American  millionaire's yacht landed a party who shot as many brooding birds on  St. Mary island as they chose, and then left the bodies to rot and  the broods to perish. That was, presumably, for sport. For the same  kind of sport, motor boats cut circles round diving birds, drown them,  and let the bodies float away. The North Shore people have drowned  myriads of moulting scoters in August; but they use the meat. Bestial  forms of sport are many and vile. \"C'est un plaisir superbe\" was the  description given by some voyageurs on exploring work, who had spent  the afternoon chasing young birds about the rocks and stamping them to  death. Deer were literally hacked to pieces by construction gangs on  new lines last summer. Dynamiting a stream is quite a common trick  wherever it is safe to play it. Harbour seals are wantonly shot in  deep fresh water where they cannot be recovered, much as seagulls are  shot by blackguards from an ocean liner.    And the worst of it is that all this wanton destruction is not by any  means confined to the ignorant or those who have been brought up to  it. The men from the American yacht must have known better. So do  those educated men from our own cities, who shoot out of season down  the St. Lawrence and plead, quite falsely, that there is no game law  below the Brandy Pots. It is, of course, well understood that a man  can always shoot for necessary food. But this provision is shamelessly  misused. Last summer, when a great employer of labour down the Gulf  was telling where birds could be shot to the greatest advantage out of  season, and I was objecting that it was not clean sport, he said, \"Oh,  but Indians can shoot for food at any time--_and we're all Indians  here!\"_ And what are we to think of a rich man who used caribou simply  as targets for his new rifle, and a scientific man who killed 72 in  one morning, only to make a record? We need the true ideal of sport  and an altogether new ideal of conservation, and we need them very  badly and very soon.    We have had our warnings. The great auk and the Labrador duck have  both become utterly extinct within living memory. The Eskimo curlew is  decreasing to the danger point, and the Yellowlegs is following. The  lobster fishing is being wastefully conducted along the St. Lawrence;  so, indeed, are the other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#3)"],[1," and why does he not resolve it correctly? How dare he indulge  in those scandalous and illicit transitions into a key that has not  one note in common with the key he has just left? Listen to those false  relations! What does he want with six drums and eight horns when Mozart  worked miracles with two of each? The man is no musician.\" The layman  neither knows nor cares about any of these things. If Wagner were to  turn aside from his straightforward dramatic purpose to propitiate the  professors with correct exercises in sonata form, his music would at  once become unintelligible to the unsophisticated spectator, upon whom  the familiar and dreaded \"classical\" sensation would descend like the  influenza. Nothing of the kind need be dreaded. The unskilled, untaught  musician may approach Wagner boldly; for there is no possibility of a  misunderstanding between them: The Ring music is perfectly single and  simple. It is the adept musician of the old school who has everything to  unlearn: and him I leave, unpitied, to his fate.          THE RING OF THE NIBLUNGS    The Ring consists of four plays, intended to be performed on four  successive evenings, entitled The Rhine Gold (a prologue to the other  three), The Valkyries, Siegfried, and Night Falls On The Gods; or, in  the original German, Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, and Die  Gotterdammerung.          THE RHINE GOLD    Let me assume for a moment that you are a young and good-looking woman.  Try to imagine yourself in that character at Klondyke five years ago.  The place is teeming with gold. If you are content to leave the gold  alone, as the wise leave flowers without plucking them, enjoying with  perfect naivete its color and glitter and preciousness, no human being  will ever be the worse for your knowledge of it; and whilst you remain  in that frame of mind the golden age will endure.    Now suppose a man comes along: a man who has no sense of the golden  age, nor any power of living in the present: a man with common desires,  cupidities, ambitions, just like most of the men you know. Suppose you  reveal to that man the fact that if he will only pluck this gold up,  and turn it into money, millions of men, driven by the invisible whip  of hunger, will toil underground and overground night and day to pile  up more and more gold for him until he is master of the world! You will  find that the prospect will not tempt him so much as you might imagine,  because it involves some distasteful trouble to himself to start with,  and because there is something else within his reach involving no  distasteful toil, which he desires more passionately; and that is  yourself. So long as he is preoccupied with love of you, the gold, and  all that it implies, will escape him: the golden age will endure. Not  until he forswears love will he stretch out his hand to the gold, and  found the Plutonic empire for himself. But the choice between love and  gold may not rest altogether with him. He may be an ugly, ungracious,  unamiable person, whose affections may seem merely ludicrous and  despicable to you. In that case, you may repulse him, and most bitterly  humiliate and disappoint him. What is left to him then but to curse the  love he can never win, and turn remorselessly to the gold? With that,  he will make short work of your golden age, and leave you lamenting its  lost thoughtlessness and sweetness.    In due time the gold of Klondyke will find its way to the great cities  of the world. But the old dilemma will keep continually reproducing  itself. The man who will turn his back on love, and upon all the  fruitful it, and will set himself single-heartedly to gather gold in an  exultant dream of wielding its Plutonic powers, will find the treasure  yielding quickly to his touch. But few men will make this sacrifice  voluntarily. Not until the Plutonic power is so strongly set up that the  higher human impulses are suppressed as rebellious, and even the mere  appetites are denied, starved, and insulted when they cannot purchase  their satisfaction with gold, are the energetic spirits driven to build  their lives upon riches. How inevitable that course has become to us is  plain enough to those who have the power of understanding what they see  as they look at the plutocratic societies of our modern capitals.    First Scene    Here, then, is the subject of the first scene of The Rhine Gold. As  you sit waiting for the curtain to rise, you suddenly catch the booming  ground-tone of a mighty river. It becomes plainer, clearer: you get  nearer to the surface, and catch the green light and the flights of  bubbles. Then the curtain goes up and you see what you heard--the depths  of the Rhine, with three strange fairy fishes, half water-maidens,  singing and enjoying themselves exuberantly. They are not singing  barcarolles or ballads about the Lorely and her fated lovers, but simply  trolling any nonsense that comes into their heads in time to the dancing  of the water and the rhythm of their swimming. It is the golden age; and  the attraction of this spot for the Rhine maidens is a lump of the Rhine  gold, which they value, in an entirely uncommercial way, for its bodily  beauty and splendor. Just at present it is eclipsed, because the sun is  not striking down through the water.    Presently there comes a poor devil of a dwarf stealing along the  slippery rocks of the river bed, a creature with energy enough to make  him strong of body and fierce of passion, but with a brutish narrowness  of intelligence and selfishness of imagination: too stupid to see that  his own welfare can only be compassed as part of the welfare of the  world, too full of brute force not to grab vigorously at his own gain.  Such dwarfs are quite common in London. He comes now with a fruitful  impulse in him, in search of what he lacks in himself, beauty, lightness  of heart, imagination, music. The Rhine maidens, representing all these  to him, fill him with hope and longing; and he never considers that he  has nothing to offer that they could possibly desire, being by natural  limitation incapable of seeing anything from anyone else's point of  view. With perfect simplicity, he offers himself as a sweetheart to  them. But they are thoughtless, elemental, only half real things, much  like modern young ladies. That the poor dwarf is repulsive to their  sense of physical beauty and their romantic conception of heroism, that  he is ugly and awkward, greedy and ridiculous, disposes for them of his  claim to live and love. They mock him atrociously, pretending to fall in  love with him at first sight, and then slipping away and making game of  him, heaping ridicule and disgust on the poor wretch until he is beside  himself with mortification and rage. They forget him when the water  begins to glitter in the sun, and the gold to reflect its glory. They  break into ecstatic worship of their treasure; and though they know the  parable of Klondyke quite well, they have no fear that the gold will be  wrenched away by the dwarf, since it will yield to no one who has not  forsworn love for it, and it is in pursuit of love that he has come to  them. They forget that they have poisoned that desire in him by their  mockery and denial of it, and that he now knows that life will give him  nothing that he cannot wrest from it by the Plutonic power. It is just  as if some poor, rough, vulgar, coarse fellow were to offer to take his  part in aristocratic society, and be snubbed into the knowledge that  only as a millionaire could he ever hope to bring that society to his  feet and buy himself a beautiful and refined wife. His choice is forced  on him. He forswears love as thousands of us forswear it every day; and  in a moment the gold is in his grasp, and he disappears in the depths,  leaving the water-fairies vainly screaming \"Stop thief!\" whilst the  river seems to plunge into darkness and sink from us as we rise to the  cloud regions above.    And now, what forces are there in the world to resist Alberic, our  dwarf, in his new character of sworn plutocrat? He is soon at  work wielding the power of the gold. For his gain, hordes of his  fellow-creatures are thenceforth condemned to slave miserably,  overground and underground, lashed to their work by the invisible whip  of starvation. They never see him, any more than the victims of our  \"dangerous trades\" ever see the shareholders whose power is nevertheless  everywhere, driving them to destruction. The very wealth they create  with their labor becomes an additional force to impoverish them; for as  fast as they make it it slips from their hands into the hands of their  master, and makes him mightier than ever. You can see the process for  yourself in every civilized country today, where millions of people toil  in want and disease to heap up more wealth for our Alberics, laying up  nothing for themselves, except sometimes horrible and agonizing disease  and the certainty of premature death. All this part of the story is  frightfully real, frightfully present, frightfully modern; and its  effects on our social life are so ghastly and ruinous that we no longer  know enough of happiness to be discomposed by it. It is only the  poet, with his vision of what life might be, to whom these things are  unendurable. If we were a race of poets we would make an end of them  before the end of this miserable century. Being a race of moral dwarfs  instead, we think them highly respectable, comfortable and proper, and  allow them to breed and multiply their evil in all directions. If there  were no higher power in the world to work against Alberic, the end of it  would be utter destruction.    Such a force there is, however; and it is called Godhead. The mysterious  thing we call life organizes itself into all living shapes, bird, beast,  beetle and fish, rising to the human marvel in cunning dwarfs and  in laborious muscular giants, capable, these last, of enduring"]]]
