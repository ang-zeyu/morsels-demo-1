Concerning all the other provinces of the Western Empire we have  continuous information. It is only in Britain that an age of fable  completely separates two ages of truth. Odoacer and Totila, Euric and  Thrasimund, Clovis, Fredegunda, and Brunechild, are historical men and  women. But Hengist and Horsa, Vortigern and Rowena, Arthur and Mordred  are mythical persons, whose very existence may be questioned, and whose  adventures must be classed with those of Hercules and Romulus.    At length the darkness begins to break; and the country which had been  lost to view as Britain reappears as England. The conversion of the  Saxon colonists to Christianity was the first of a long series of  salutary revolutions. It is true that the Church had been deeply  corrupted both by that superstition and by that philosophy against which  she had long contended, and over which she had at last triumphed. She  had given a too easy admission to doctrines borrowed from the ancient  schools, and to rites borrowed from the ancient temples. Roman policy  and Gothic ignorance, Grecian ingenuity and Syrian asceticism, had  contributed to deprave her. Yet she retained enough of the sublime  theology and benevolent morality of her earlier days to elevate many  intellects, and to purify many hearts. Some things also which at a later  period were justly regarded as among her chief blemishes were, in the  seventh century, and long afterwards, among her chief merits. That  the sacerdotal order should encroach on the functions of the civil  magistrate would, in our time, be a great evil. But that which in an age  of good government is an evil may, in an ago of grossly bad government,  be a blessing. It is better that mankind should be governed by wise  laws well administered, and by an enlightened public opinion, than by  priestcraft: but it is better that men should be governed by priestcraft  than by brute violence, by such a prelate as Dunstan than by such  a warrior as Penda. A society sunk in ignorance, and ruled by mere  physical force, has great reason to rejoice when a class, of which the  influence is intellectual and moral, rises to ascendancy. Such a class  will doubtless abuse its power: but mental power, even when abused,  is still a nobler and better power than that which consists merely in  corporeal strength. We read in our Saxon chronicles of tyrants, who,  when at the height of greatness, were smitten with remorse, who abhorred  the pleasures and dignities which they had purchased by guilt, who  abdicated their crowns, and who sought to atone for their offences by  cruel penances and incessant prayers. These stories have drawn forth  bitter expressions of contempt from some writers who, while they boasted  of liberality, were in truth as narrow-minded as any monk of the dark  ages, and whose habit was to apply to all events in the history of the  world the standard received in the Parisian society of the eighteenth  century. Yet surely a system which, however deformed by superstition,  introduced strong moral restraints into communities previously governed  only by vigour of muscle and by audacity of spirit, a system which  taught the fiercest and mightiest ruler that he was, like his meanest  bondman, a responsible being, might have seemed to deserve a more  respectful mention from philosophers and philanthropists.    The same observations will apply to the contempt with which, in the  last century, it was fashionable to speak of the pilgrimages, the  sanctuaries, the crusades, and the monastic institutions of the middle  ages. In times when men were scarcely ever induced to travel by liberal  curiosity, or by the pursuit of gain, it was better that the rude  inhabitant of the North should visit Italy and the East as a pilgrim,  than that he should never see anything but those squalid cabins and  uncleared woods amidst which he was born. In times when life and when  female honour were exposed to daily risk from tyrants and marauders,  it was better that the precinct of a shrine should be regarded with  an irrational awe, than that there should be no refuge inaccessible to  cruelty and licentiousness. In times when statesmen were incapable  of forming extensive political combinations, it was better that the  Christian nations should be roused and united for the recovery of the  Holy Sepulchre, than that they should, one by one, be overwhelmed by  the Mahometan power. Whatever reproach may, at a later period, have been  justly thrown on the indolence and luxury of religious orders, it was  surely good that, in an age of ignorance and violence, there should be  quiet cloisters and gardens, in which the arts of peace could be safely  cultivated, in which gentle and contemplative natures could find an  asylum, in which one brother could employ himself in transcribing the  AEneid of Virgil, and another in meditating the Analytics of Aristotle,  in which he who had a genius for art might illuminate a martyrology or  carve a crucifix, and in which he who had a turn for natural philosophy  might make experiments on the properties of plants and minerals. Had  not such retreats been scattered here and there, among the huts of  a miserable peasantry, and the castles of a ferocious aristocracy,  European society would have consisted merely of beasts of burden and  beasts of prey. The Church has many times been compared by divines  to the ark of which we read in the Book of Genesis: but never was the  resemblance more perfect than during that evil time when she alone rode,  amidst darkness and tempest, on the deluge beneath which all the great  works of ancient power and wisdom lay entombed, bearing within her that  feeble germ from which a Second and more glorious civilisation was to  spring.    Even the spiritual supremacy arrogated by the Pope was, in the dark  ages, productive of far more good than evil. Its effect was to unite the  nations of Western Europe in one great commonwealth. What the Olympian  chariot course and the Pythian oracle were to all the Greek cities, from  Trebizond to Marseilles, Rome and her Bishop were to all Christians  of the Latin communion, from Calabria to the Hebrides. Thus grew up  sentiments of enlarged benevolence. Races separated from each other by  seas and mountains acknowledged a fraternal tie and a common code of  public law. Even in war, the cruelty of the conqueror was not seldom  mitigated by the recollection that he and his vanquished enemies were  all members of one great federation.    Into this federation our Saxon ancestors were now admitted. A regular  communication was opened between our shores and that part of Europe in  which the traces of ancient power and policy were yet discernible.  Many noble monuments which have since been destroyed or defaced still  retained their pristine magnificence; and travellers, to whom Livy and  Sallust were unintelligible, might gain from the Roman aqueducts and  temples some faint notion of Roman history. The dome of Agrippa, still  glittering with bronze, the mausoleum of Adrian, not yet deprived of its  columns and statues, the Flavian amphitheatre, not yet degraded into a  quarry, told to the rude English pilgrims some part of the story of that  great civilised world which had passed away. The islanders returned,  with awe deeply impressed on their half opened minds, and told the  wondering inhabitants of the hovels of London and York that, near the  grave of Saint Peter, a mighty race, now extinct, had piled up buildings  which would never be dissolved till the judgment day. Learning followed  in the train of Christianity. The poetry and eloquence of the Augustan  age was assiduously studied in Mercian and Northumbrian monasteries. The  names of Bede and Alcuin were justly celebrated throughout Europe. Such  was the state of our country when, in the ninth century, began the last  great migration of the northern barbarians.    During many years Denmark and Scandinavia continued to pour forth  innumerable pirates, distinguished by strength, by valour, by merciless  ferocity, and by hatred of the Christian name. No country suffered so  much from these invaders as England. Her coast lay near to the ports  whence they sailed; nor was any shire so far distant from the sea as  to be secure from attack. The same atrocities which had attended the  victory of the Saxon over the Celt were now, after the lapse of ages,  suffered by the Saxon at the hand of the Dane. Civilization,--just as  it began to rise, was met by this blow, and sank down once more. Large  colonies of adventurers from the Baltic established themselves on the  eastern shores of our island, spread gradually westward, and, supported  by constant reinforcements from beyond the sea, aspired to the dominion  of the whole realm. The struggle between the two fierce Teutonic breeds  lasted through six generations. Each was alternately paramount. Cruel  massacres followed by cruel retribution, provinces wasted, convents  plundered, and cities rased to the ground, make up the greater part of  the history of those evil days. At length the North ceased to send forth  a constant stream of fresh depredators; and from that time the mutual  aversion of the races began to subside. Intermarriage became frequent.  The Danes learned the religion of the Saxons; and thus one cause  of deadly animosity was removed. The Danish and Saxon tongues, both  dialects of one widespread language, were blended together. But the  distinction between the two nations was by no means effaced, when  an event took place which prostrated both, in common slavery and  degradation, at the feet of a third people.    The Normans were then the foremost race of Christendom. Their valour and  ferocity had made them conspicuous among the rovers whom Scandinavia had  sent forth to ravage Western Europe."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#3)"],[1,"cherished their Sanskrit and Hindi for their own  purposes of business or worship, while the Emperor and his Moghul  courtiers kept up their Turkish speech as a means of free  intercourse in private life. The Chaghtai dialect resembled the  Turkish still spoken in Kashgar.    Out of such elements was the rich and still growing language of  Hindustan formed, and it is yearly becoming more widely spread  over the most remote parts of the country, being largely taught  in Government schools, and used as a medium of translation from  European literature, both by the English and by the natives. For  this purpose it is peculiarly suited, from still possessing the  power of assimilating foreign roots, instead of simply inserting  them cut and dried, as is the case with languages that have  reached maturity. Its own words are also liable to a kind of  chemical change when encountering foreign matter (e.g., jau,  barley: when oats were introduced some years ago, they were at  once called jaui  \"little barley\").    The peninsula of India is to Asia what Italy is to Europe, and  Hindustan may be roughly likened to Italy without the two  Sicilies, only on a far larger scale. In this comparison the  Himalayas represent the Alps, and the Tartars to the north are  the Tedeschi of India; Persia is to her as France, Piedmont is  represented by Kabul, and Lombardy by the Panjab. A recollection  of this analogy may not be without use in familiarizing the  narrative which is to follow.    Such was the country into which successive waves of invaders,  some of them, perhaps, akin to the actual ancestors of the Goths,  Huns, and Saxons of Europe, poured down from the plains of  Central Asia. At the time of which our history treats, the  aboriginal Indians had long been pushed out from Hindustan into  the mountainous forests that border the Deccan; which country has  been largely peopled, in its more accessible regions, by the  Sudras, who were probably the first of the Scythian invaders.  After them had come the Sanskrit-speaking race, a congener of the  ancient Persians, who brought a form of fire-worshipping, perhaps  once monotheistic, of which traces are still extant in the Vedas,  their early Scriptures. This form of faith becoming weak and  eclectic, was succeeded by a reaction, which, under the auspices  of Gautama, obtained general currency, until in its turn  displaced by the gross mythology of the Puranas, which has since  been the popular creed of the Hindus.    This people in modern times has divided into three main  denominations: the Sarawagis or Jains (who represent some sect  allied to the Buddhists or followers of Gautama); the sect of  Shiva, and the sect of Vishnu.    In addition to the Hindus, later waves of immigration have  deposited a Musalman population  somewhat increased by the  conversions that occurred under Aurangzeb. The Mohamadans are now  about one-seventh of the total population of Hindustan; and there  is no reason to suppose that this ratio has greatly varied since  the fall of the Moghuls.    The Mohamadans in India preserved their religion, though not  without some taint from the circumjacent idolatry. Their  celebration of the Moharram, with tasteless and extravagant  ceremonies, and their forty days' fast in Ramzan, were alike  misplaced in a country where, from the movable nature of their  dates, they sometimes fell in seasons when the rigour of the  climate was such as could never have been contemplated by the  Arabian Prophet. They continued the bewildering lunar year of the  Hijra, with its thirteenth month every third year; but, to  increase the confusion, the Moghul Emperors also reckoned by  Turkish cycles while the Hindus tenaciously maintained in matters  of business their national Sambat, or era of Raja Bikram Ajit.    The Emperor Akbar, in the course of his endeavours to fuse the  peoples of India into a whole, endeavoured amongst other things  to form a new religion. This, it was his intention, should be at  once a vindication of his Tartar and Persian forefathers against  Arab proselytism, and a bid for the suffrages of his Hindu  subjects. Like most eclectic systems it failed. In and after his  time also Christianity in its various forms has been feebly  endeavouring to maintain a footing. This is a candid report, from  a source that cannot but be trusted, of the result of three  centuries of Missionary labour.    \"There is nothing which can at all warrant the opinion that the  heart of the people has been largely touched, or that the  conscience of the people has been affected seriously. There is no  advance in the direction of faith in Christ, like that which  Pliny describes, or Tertullian proclaims as characteristic of  former eras. In fact, looking at the work of Missions on the  broadest scale, and especially upon that of our own Missions, we  must confess that, in many cases, the condition is one rather of  stagnation than of advance. There seems to be a want in them of  the power to edify, and a consequent paralysis of the power to  convert. The converts, too often, make such poor progress in the  Christian life, that they fail to act as leaven in the lump of  their countrymen. In particular, the Missions do not attract to  Christ many men of education; not even among those who have been  trained within their own schools. Educated natives, as a general  rule, will stand apart from the truth; maintaining, at the best,  a state of mental vacuity which hangs suspended, for a time,  between an atheism, from which they shrink, and a Christianity,  which fails to overcome their fears and constrain their  allegiance.\"  Extract from Letter of the Anglican Bishops of  India, addressed to the English Clergy, in May, 1874.    The capital cities of Northern India have always been Dehli and  Agra; the first-named having been the seat of the earlier  Musalman Empires, while the Moghuls, for more than a full  century, preferred to hold their Court at Agra. This dynasty,  however, re-transferred the metropolis to the older situation;  but, instead of attempting to revive any of the pristine  localities, fixed their palace and its environs upon a new--and a  preferablepiece of ground.    If India be the Italy of Asia, still more properly may it be said  that Dehli is its Rome. This ancient site stretches ruined for  many miles round the present inhabited area, and its original  foundation is lost in a mythical antiquity. A Hindu city called  Indraprastha was certainly there on the bank of the Jamna near  the site of the present city before the Christian era, and  various Mohamadan conquerors occupied sites in the neighbourhood,  of which numerous remains are still extant. There was also a city  near the present Kutb Minar, built by a Hindu rajah, about 57  B.C. according to General Cunningham. This was the original (or  old) Dilli or Dehli, a name of unascertained origin. It appears  to have been deserted during the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni,  but afterwards rebuilt about 1060 A.D. The last built of all the  ancient towns was the Din Panah of Humayun, nearly on the site of  the old Hindu town; but it had gone greatly to decay during the  long absence of his son and grandson at Agra and elsewhere.    At length New Dehlithe present citywas founded by Shahjahan,  the great-grandson of Humayun, and received the name, by which it  is still known to Mohamudans, of Shahjahanabad. The city is seven  miles round, with seven gates, the palace or citadel one-tenth of  the area. Both are a sort of irregular semicircle on the right  bank of the Jamna, which river forms their eastern arc. The plain  is about 800 feet above the level of the sea, and is bordered at  some distance by a low range of hills, and receiving the drainage  of the Mewat Highlands. The greatest heat is in June, when the  mean temperature in the shade is 92¡ F.; but it falls as low as  53¡ in January. The situationas will be seen by the mapis  extremely well chosen as the administrative centre of Hindustan;  it must always be a place of commercial importance, and the  climate has no peculiar defect. The only local disorder is a very  malignant sore, which may perhaps be due to the brackishness of  the water. This would account for the numerous and expensive  canals and aqueducts which have been constructed at different  periods to bring water from remote and pure sources. Here  Shahjahan founded, in 1645 A.D., a splendid fortified palace,  which continued to be occupied by his descendants down to the  Great Revolt of 1857.    The entrance to the palace was, and still is, defended by a lofty  barbican, passing which the visitor finds himself in an immense  arcaded vestibule, wide and lofty, formerly appropriated to the  men and officers of the guard, but in later days tenanted by  small shopkeepers. This opened into a courtyard, at the back of  which was a gate surmounted by a gallery, where one used to hear  the barbarous performances of the royal band. Passing under this,  the visitor entered the 'Am-Khas or courtyard, much fallen from  its state, when the rare animals and the splendid military  pageants of the earlier Emperors used to throng its area.  Fronting you was the Diwan-i-Am (since converted into a canteen),  and at the back (towards the east or river) the Diwan-i-Khas,  since adequately restored. This latter pavilion is in echelon  with the former, and was made to communicate on both sides with  the private apartments.    On the east of the palace, and connected with it by a bridge  crossing an arm of the river, is the ancient Pathan fort of  Salimgarh, a rough and dismal structure, which the later Emperors  used as a state prison. It is a remarkable contrast to the rest  of the fortress, which is surrounded by crenellated walls of high  finish. These walls being built of the red sandstone of the  neighbourhood, and seventy feet in height, give to the exterior  of the buildings a solemn air of passive and"]]]
