The  manuscripts were left in an imperfect state, Sydney Smith probably  supposing that no call would ever be made for their publication.  They were written merely for popular effect, to be spoken before  a miscellaneous audience, in which any abstract topics of moral  philosophy would be the last to awaken an interest. The title of  the book is accordingly a misnomer. It would lead no one to suspect  the rich and diversified character of its contents. They present no  ambitious attempts at metaphysical disquisition. They are free from  dry technicalities of ethical speculation. They have no specimens of  logical hair-splitting, no pedantic array of barren definitions, no  subtle distinctions proceeding from an ingenious fancy, and without  any foundation in nature. On the contrary, we find in this volume a  series of lively, off-hand, dashing comments on men and manners, often  running into broad humor, and always marked with the pungent common  sense that never forsook the facetious divine. His remarks on the  conduct of the understanding, on literary habits, on the use and value  of books, and other themes of a similar character, are for the most  part instructive and practical as well as piquant, and on the whole,  the admirers of Sydney Smith will have no reason to regret the  publication of the volume.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE LONDON TIMES.]    BIOGRAPHY OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.    In the following brief narrative of the principal facts in the life of  the great statesman who has just been snatched from among us, we must  disclaim all intention of dealing with his biography in any searching  or ambitious spirit. The national loss is so great, the bereavement  is so sudden, that we cannot sit down calmly either to eulogize or  arraign the memory of the deceased. We cannot forget that it was not  a week ago we were occupied in recording and commenting upon his last  eloquent address to that assembly which had so often listened with  breathless attention to his statesmanlike expositions of policy. We  could do little else when the mournful intelligence reached us that  Sir Robert Peel was no more, than pen a few expressions of sorrow  and respect. Even now the following imperfect record of facts must  be accepted as a poor substitute for the biography of that great  Englishman whose loss will be felt almost as a private bereavement by  every family throughout the British Empire:--    Sir Robert Peel was in the 63d year of his age, having been born near  Bury, in Lancashire, on the 5th of February, 1788. His father was a  manufacturer on a grand scale, and a man of much natural ability, and  of almost unequaled opulence. Full of a desire to render his son and  probable successor worthy of the influence and the vast wealth which  he had to bestow, the first Sir Robert Peel took the utmost pains  personally with the early training of the future prime minister. He  retained his son under his own immediate superintendence until he  arrived at a sufficient age to be sent to Harrow. Lord Byron, his  contemporary at Harrow, was a better declaimer and a more amusing  actor, but in sound learning and laborious application to school  duties young Peel had no equal. He had scarcely completed his 16th  year when he left Harrow and became a gentleman commoner of Christ  Church, Oxford, where he took the degree of A.B., in 1808, with  unprecedented distinction.    The year 1809 saw him attain his majority, and take his seat in the  House of Commons as a member for Cashel, in Tipperary.    The first Sir Robert Peel had long been a member of the House of  Commons, and the early efforts of his son in that assembly were  regarded with considerable interest, not only on account of his  University reputation, but also because he was the son of such a  father. He did not, however, begin public life by staking his fame on  the results of one elaborate oration; on the contrary, he rose now and  then on comparatively unimportant occasions; made a few brief modest  remarks, stated a fact or two, explained a difficulty when he happened  to understand the matter in hand better than others, and then sat down  without taxing too severely the patience or good nature of an auditory  accustomed to great performances. Still in the second year of his  parliamentary course he ventured to make a set speech, when, at the  commencement of the session of 1810, he seconded the address in  reply to the King's speech. Thenceforward for nineteen years a more  highflying Tory than Mr. Peel was not to be found within the walls of  parliament. Lord Eldon applauded him as a young and valiant champion  of those abuses in the state which were then fondly called \"the  institutions of the country.\" Lord Sidmouth regarded him as the  rightful political heir, and even the Duke of Cumberland patronized  Mr. Peel. He further became the favorite _eleve_ of Mr. Perceval, the  first lord of the treasury, and entered office as under-secretary  for the home department. He continued in the home department for two  years, not often speaking in parliament, but rather qualifying himself  for those prodigious labors in debate, in council, and in office,  which it has since been his lot to encounter and perform.    In May, 1812, Mr. Perceval fell by the hand of an assassin, and the  composition of the ministry necessarily underwent a great change. The  result, so far as Mr. Peel was concerned, was, that he was appointed  Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Mr. Peel had only  reached his 26th year when, in the month of September, 1812, the  duties of that anxious and laborious position were entrusted to his  hands. The legislative union was then but lately consummated, and the  demand for Catholic emancipation had given rise to an agitation of  only very recent date. But, in proportion to its novelty, so was its  vigor. Mr. Peel was, therefore, as the representative of the old tory  Protestant school, called upon to encounter a storm of unpopularity,  such as not even an Irish secretary has ever been exposed to. The  late Mr. O'Connell in various forms poured upon Mr. Peel a torrent  of invective which went beyond even his extraordinary performances  in the science of scolding. At length he received from Mr. Peel a  hostile message. Negotiations went on for three or four days, when  Mr. O'Connell was taken into custody and bound over to keep the peace  toward all his fellow-subjects in Ireland. Mr. Peel and his friend  immediately went to England, and subsequently proceeded to the  continent. Mr. O'Connell followed them to London, but the police were  active enough to bring him before the chief justice, when he entered  into recognizances to keep the peace toward all his majesty's  subjects; and so ended one of the few personal squabbles in which Mr.  Peel had ever been engaged. For six years he held the office of chief  secretary to the lord-lieutenant, at a time when the government was  conducted upon what might be called \"anti-conciliation principles.\"  The opposite course was commenced by Mr. Peel's immediate successor,  Mr. Charles Grant, now Lord Glenelg.    That a chief secretary so circumstanced, struggling to sustain extreme  Orangeism in its dying agonies, should have been called upon to  encounter great toil and anxiety is a truth too obvious to need  illustration. That in these straits Mr. Peel acquitted himself with  infinite address was as readily acknowledged at that time as it has  ever been even in the zenith of his fame. He held office in that  country under three successive viceroys, the Duke of Richmond, Earl  Whitworth, and Earl Talbot, all of whom have long since passed away  from this life, their names and their deeds long forgotten. But the  history of their chief secretary happens not to have been composed  of such perishable materials, and we now approach one of the most  memorable passages of his eventful career. He was chairman of the  great bullion committee; but before he engaged in that stupendous task  he had resigned the chief secretaryship of Ireland. As a consequence  of the report of that committee, he took charge of and introduced the  bill for authorizing a return to cash payments which bears his name,  and which measure received the sanction of parliament in the year  1819. That measure brought upon Mr. Peel no slight or temporary odium.  The first Sir Robert Peel was then alive, and altogether differed from  his son as to the tendency of his measure. It was roundly asserted at  the time, and very faintly denied, that it rendered that gentleman a  more wealthy man, by something like half a million sterling, than he  had previously been. The deceased statesman, however, must, in common  justice, be acquitted of any sinister purpose.    This narrative now reaches the year 1820, when we have to relate the  only domestic event in the history of Sir Robert Peel which requires  notice. On the 8th of June, being then in the 33d year of his age,  he married Julia, daughter of General Sir John Floyd, who had then  attained the age of 25.    Two years afterward there was a lull in public affairs, which gave  somewhat the appearance of tranquillity. Lord Sidmouth was growing  old, he thought that his system was successful, and that at length he  might find repose. He considered it then consistent with his public  duty to consign to younger and stronger hands the seals of the home  department. He accepted a seat in the cabinet without office, and  continued to give his support to Lord Liverpool, his ancient political  chief. In permitting his mantle to fall upon Mr. Peel, he thought he  was assisting to invest with authority one whose views and policy were  as narrow as his own, and whose practise in carrying them out would  be not less rigid and uncompromising. But, like many others, he lived  long enough to be grievously disappointed by the subsequent career of  him whom the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13722"],[0,"Youth and Sex: Dangers and Safeguards for Girls and Boys (#3)"],[1,"illuminated by the throes of conversion. From a period of great  anxiety and doubt she emerges to a time of intense love and devotion,  to an eager desire to prove herself worthy, and to offer a sacrifice  of the best powers she possesses. Unfortunately for peace of mind, the  happy epoch succeeding conversion not unfrequently ends in a dismal  time of intellectual doubt and spiritual darkness. Just as the  embryonic love of the youthful adolescent leads to a time when the  opposite sex is rather an object of dislike than of attraction, so the  fervour of early conversion is apt to lead to a time of desolation;  but just as the incomplete sex love of early adolescence finds its  antitype and fine flower in the later fully developed love of  honourable man and woman, so does the too rapturous and uncalculating  religious devotion of these early years revive after the period of  doubt, transfigured and glorified into the religious conviction and  devotion which makes the strength, the joy, and the guiding principle  of adult life.    Much depends on the circumstances and people surrounding the  adolescent. Her unbounded capacity for hero-worship leads in many  instances to a conscious or unconscious copying of parent, guardian,  or teacher; and although the ideals of the young are apt to far  outpace those of the adult whose days of illusion are over, yet they  are probably formed on the same type. One sees this illustrated by  generations in the same family holding much the same religious or  political opinions and showing the same aptitude for certain  professions, games, and pursuits. Much there is in heredity, but  probably there is still more in environment.          CHAPTER II.    OUR DUTIES TOWARDS ADOLESCENT GIRLS.      These may be briefly summed up by saying that we have to provide  adolescent girls with all things that are necessary for their souls  and their bodies, but any such bald and wholesale enunciation of our  duty helps but little in clearing one's ideas and in pointing out the  actual manner in which we are to perform it.    First, with regard to the bodies of adolescent girls; Their primary  needs, just like the primary needs of all living beings, are food,  warmth, shelter, exercise and rest, with special care in sickness.    Food.--In spite of the great advance of knowledge in the present day,  it is doubtful whether much practical advance has been made in the  dietetics of children and adolescents, and it is to be feared that our  great schools are especially deficient in this most important respect.  Even when the age of childhood is past, young people require a much  larger amount of milk than is usually included in their diet sheet. It  would be well for them to begin the day with porridge and milk or some  such cereal preparation. Coffee or cocoa made with milk should  certainly have the preference over tea for breakfast, and in addition  to the porridge or other such dish, fish, egg, or bacon, with plenty  of bread and butter, should form the morning repast. The midday meal  should consist of fresh meat, fish, or poultry, with an abundance of  green vegetables and a liberal helping of sweet pudding. The articles  of diet which are most deficient in our lists are milk, butter, and  sugar. There is an old prejudice against sugar which is quite  unfounded so far as the healthy individual is concerned. Cane sugar  has recently been proved to be a most valuable muscle food, and when  taken in the proper way for sweetening beverages, fruit, and puddings,  it is entirely good. The afternoon meal should consist chiefly of  bread and butter and milk or cocoa, with a fair proportion of simple,  well-made cake, and in the case where animal food has been taken both  at breakfast and dinner, the evening meal might well be bread and  butter, bread and milk, or milk pudding with stewed or fresh fruit.  But it is different in the case of those adolescents whose midday meal  is necessarily slight, and who ought to have a thoroughly good dinner  or supper early in the evening;    One would have thought it unnecessary to mention alcohol in speaking  of the dietary of young people were it not that, strange to say, beer  is still given at some of our public schools. It is extraordinary that  wise and intelligent people should still give beer to young boys and  girls at the very time when what they want is strength and not  stimulus, food for the growing frame and nothing to stimulate the  already exuberant passions.    An invariable rule with regard to the food of children should be that  their meals should be regular, that they should consist of good,  varied, nourishing food taken at regular hours, and that nothing  should be eaten between meals. The practice of eating biscuits, fruit,  and sweets between meals during childhood and adolescence not only  spoils the digestion and impairs the nutrition at the time, but it is  apt to lay the foundation of a constant craving for something which is  only too likely to take the form of alcoholic craving in later years.  It is impossible for the stomach to perform its duty satisfactorily if  it is never allowed rest, and the introduction of stray morsels of  food at irregular times prevents this, and introduces confusion into  the digestive work, because there will be in the stomach at the same  time food in various stages of digestion.    Warmth.--Warmth is one of the influences essential to health and to  sound development, and although artificial warmth is more urgently  required by little children and by old people than it is by young  adults, still, if their bodies are to come to their utmost possible  perfection, they require suitable conditions of temperature. This is  provided in the winter partly by artificial heating of houses and  partly by the wearing of suitable clothing. Ideal clothing is loose of  texture and woven of wool, although a fairly good substitute can be  obtained in materials that are made from cotton treated specially.    This is not the time or place in which to insist on the very grave  dangers that accompany the use of ordinary flannelette, but a caution  must be addressed in passing to those who provide clothing for others.  In providing clothes it is necessary to remember the two reasons for  their existence: (1) to cover the body, and (2) as far as possible to  protect a large area of its surface against undue damp and cold.    Adolescents, as a rule, begin early to take a great interest in their  clothes. From the time that the appreciation of the opposite sex  commences, the child who has hitherto been indifferent or even  slovenly in the matter of clothing takes a very living interest in it;  indeed the adornment of person and the minute care devoted to details  of the toilet by young people of both sexes remind one irresistibly of  the preening of the feathers, the strutting and other antics of birds  before their mates.    Girls especially are apt to forget the primary object of clothing, and  to think of it too much as a means of adornment. This leads to  excesses and follies such as tight waists, high-heeled shoes, to the  ungainly crinoline or to indecent scantiness of skirts. Direct  interference in these matters is badly tolerated, but much may be  accomplished both by example and by cultivating a refined and artistic  taste in sumptuary matters.    Sleep.--Amongst the most important of the factors that conduce to  well-being both of body and mind must be reckoned an adequate amount  of sleep. This has been made the subject of careful inquiry by Dr.  Dukes of Rugby and Miss Alice Ravenhill. Both these trained and  careful observers agree that the majority of young people get far too  little rest and sleep. We have to remember that although fully-grown  adults will take rest when they can get it in the daytime, young  people are too active, and sometimes too restless, to give any repose  to brain or muscle except during sleep. In the early years of  adolescence ten hours sleep is none too much; even an adult in full  work ought to have eight hours, and still more is necessary for the  rapidly-growing, continually-developing, and never-resting adolescent.  It is unfortunately a fact that even in the boarding schools of the  well-to-do the provision of sleep is too limited, and for the children  of the poor, whose homes are far from comfortable and who are  accustomed to doing pretty nearly as their elders do, the night seldom  begins before eleven or even twelve o'clock. It is one of the saddest  sights of London to see small children dancing on the pavement in  front of the public-houses up to a very late hour, while groups of  loafing boys and hoydenish girls stand about at the street corners  half the night. There is little wonder that the morning finds them  heavy and unrefreshed, and that schoolwork suffers severely from want  of the alert and vigorous attention that might be secured by a proper  night's sleep.    Great harm is done by allowing children to take work home with them  from school; if possible, the day's work should finish with school  hours, and the scanty leisure should be spent in healthy exercise or  in sleep.    Overcrowding.--In considering the question of adequate sleep it  would be well to think of the conditions of healthy sleep.    For sleep to be refreshing and health-giving, the sleeper ought to  have a comfortable bed and an abundant supply of fresh air.  Unfortunately the great majority of our people both in town and  country do not enjoy these advantages. In both town and country there  is a great deficiency of suitable dwellings at rents that can be paid  with the usual rate of wages. In consequence families are crowded into  one, two, or three rooms, and even in the case of people far above the  status of day labourers and artisans it is the exception and not the  rule for each individual to have a separate bed. The question of  ventilation is certainly better understood than it "]]]
