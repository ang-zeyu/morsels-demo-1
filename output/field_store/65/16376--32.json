I should never have thought  it.  You dissemble well.'    'I am not far gone enough for that,' returned Glaucus, smiling, 'or  rather I say with Tibullus--    He whom love rules, where'er his path may be, Walks safe and sacred.    In fact, I am not in love; but I could be if there were but occasion to  see the object.  Eros would light his torch, but the priests have given  him no oil.'    'Shall I guess the object?--Is it not Diomed's daughter?  She adores  you, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say again  and again, she is both handsome and rich.  She will bind the door-posts  of her husband with golden fillets.'    'No, I do not desire to sell myself.  Diomed's daughter is handsome, I  grant: and at one time, had she not been the grandchild of a freedman, I  might have...  Yet no--she carries all her beauty in her face; her  manners are not maiden-like, and her mind knows no culture save that of  pleasure.'    'You are ungrateful.  Tell me, then, who is the fortunate virgin?'    'You shall hear, my Clodius.  Several months ago I was sojourning at  Neapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains the  manners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name of  Parthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores. One day I  entered the temple of Minerva, to offer up my prayers, not for myself  more than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer. The temple was  empty and deserted. The recollections of Athens crowded fast and  meltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, and  absorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from my  heart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed. I was startled in the midst of  my devotions, however, by a deep sigh; I turned suddenly round, and just  behind me was a female.  She had raised her veil also in prayer: and  when our eyes met, methought a celestial ray shot from those dark and  smiling orbs at once into my soul.  Never, my Clodius, have I seen  mortal face more exquisitely molded: a certain melancholy softened and  yet elevated its expression: that unutterable something, which springs  from the soul, and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect of  Psyche, gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble; tears were  rolling down her eyes.  I guessed at once that she was also of Athenian  lineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded to  mine. I spoke to her, though with a faltering voice--\"Art thou not, too,  Athenian?\" said I, \"O beautiful virgin!\" At the sound of my voice she  blushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--\"My forefathers'  ashes,\" said she, \"repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is of  Neapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.\"--\"Let us, then,\"  said I, \"make our offerings together\": and, as the priest now appeared,  we stood side by side, while we followed the priest in his ceremonial  prayer; together we touched the knees of the goddess--together we laid  our olive garlands on the altar. I felt a strange emotion of almost  sacred tenderness at this companionship. We, strangers from a far and  fallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country's  deity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman,  for so I might surely call her?  I felt as if I had known her for years;  and that simple rite seemed, as by a miracle, to operate on the  sympathies and ties of time.  Silently we left the temple, and I was  about to ask her where she dwelt, and if I might be permitted to visit  her, when a youth, in whose features there was some kindred resemblance  to her own, and who stood upon the steps of the fane, took her by the  hand.  She turned round and bade me farewell.  The crowd separated us: I  saw her no more.  On reaching my home I found letters, which obliged me  to set out for Athens, for my relations threatened me with litigation  concerning my inheritance. When that suit was happily over, I repaired  once more to Neapolis; I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city,  I could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman, and, hoping to lose in  gaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition, I hastened to  plunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii.  This is all my history.  I do not love; but I remember and regret.'    As Clodius was about to reply, a slow and stately step approached them,  and at the sound it made amongst the pebbles, each turned, and each  recognized the new-comer.    It was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year, of tall  stature, and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame.  His skin, dark and  bronzed, betrayed his Eastern origin; and his features had something  Greek in their outline (especially in the chin, the lip, and the brow),  save that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline; and the bones, hard  and visible, forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecian  physiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves of  youth.  His eyes, large and black as the deepest night, shone with no  varying and uncertain lustre. A deep, thoughtful, and half-melancholy  calm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze.  His step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty, and something  foreign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments added  to the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form.  Each of the young men, in saluting the new-comer, made mechanically, and  with care to conceal it from him, a slight gesture or sign with their  fingers; for Arbaces, the Egyptian, was supposed to possess the fatal  gift of the evil eye.    'The scene must, indeed, be beautiful,' said Arbaces, with a cold though  courteous smile, 'which draws the gay Clodius, and Glaucus the all  admired, from the crowded thoroughfares of the city.'    'Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive?' asked the Greek.    'To the dissipated--yes.'    'An austere reply, but scarcely a wise one.  Pleasure delights in  contrasts; it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude, and  from solitude dissipation.'    'So think the young philosophers of the Garden,' replied the Egyptian;  'they mistake lassitude for meditation, and imagine that, because they  are sated with others, they know the delight of loneliness.  But not in  such jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws  from her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands from  you, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which you  only seek, in adoring her, a release.  When, young Athenian, the moon  revealed herself in visions of light to Endymion, it was after a day  passed, not amongst the feverish haunts of men, but on the still  mountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter.'    'Beautiful simile!' cried Glaucus; 'most unjust application! Exhaustion!  that word is for age, not youth.  By me, at least, one moment of satiety  has never been known!'    Again the Egyptian smiled, but his smile was cold and blighting, and  even the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light.  He did not,  however, reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus; but, after a  pause, he said, in a soft and melancholy voice:    'After all, you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you; the  rose soon withers, the perfume soon exhales.  And we, O Glaucus!  strangers in the land and far from our fathers' ashes, what is there  left for us but pleasure or regret!--for you the first, perhaps for me  the last.'    The bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears. 'Ah,  speak not, Arbaces,' he cried--'speak not of our ancestors.  Let us  forget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome!  And  Glory!--oh, vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathon  and Thermopylae!'    'Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,' said the Egyptian; 'and in  thy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than of  Lais. Vale!'    Thus saying, he gathered his robe around him, and slowly swept away.    'I breathe more freely,' said Clodius.  'Imitating the Egyptians, we  sometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts.  In truth, the presence of  such an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour the  richest grape of the Falernian.'    'Strange man! said Glaucus, musingly; 'yet dead though he seem to  pleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, or  his house and his heart could tell a different tale.'    'Ah! there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in his  gloomy mansion.  He is rich, too, they say.  Can we not get him amongst  us, and teach him the charms of dice?  Pleasure of pleasures! hot fever  of hope and fear! inexpressible unjaded passion! how fiercely beautiful  thou art, O Gaming!'    'Inspired--inspired!' cried Glaucus, laughing; 'the oracle speaks poetry  in Clodius.  What miracle next!'        Chapter III    PARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII. CLASSIC  REVEL.    HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given him  beauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, a  mind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom. He was  born in Athens, the subject of Rome.  Succeeding early to an ample  inheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural to  the young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasure  amidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.    He was an Alcibiades without ambition.  He was what a man of  imagination, youth, fortune, and talents, readily becomes when you  deprive him of the inspiration of glory.  His house at Rome was the  theme of the debauchees, but also of the lovers of art; and the  sculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning the  porticoes and exedrae of an Athenian."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#3)"],[1,"to bed, but he did not die.

ALICE CARY          [Illustration]    CINDERELLA--I      Once upon a time there lived a maiden named Cinderella.    Her mother was dead, and she had to work very, very hard in the kitchen.    She had two older sisters, but they were cross to little Cinderella.    They made her stay among the pots and the kettles and do all the hard  work about the house.    Sometimes, to keep warm, she crept in among the cinders.    That is why she was called Cinderella.    One day the sisters came dancing into the house. \"We have been invited  to the king's ball,\" they cried.    At length the day of the great ball came, and the two sisters rode away  in their fine silk dresses.    Poor Cinderella, who had to stay behind, looked at her old ragged  clothes, and burst into tears.    \"Alas,\" she cried, \"why should I always have to stay in the kitchen  while my sisters dress in silks and satins?\"    Hardly had she spoken when there stood before her a dear little old lady  with a golden wand in her hand.    \"My child,\" she cried, \"I am your fairy godmother, and you shall go to  the ball, too.    First go into the garden, Cinderella, and bring to me the largest  pumpkin you can find.\"    When Cinderella had done this, the fairy waved her golden wand over the  yellow pumpkin.    In a flash, it was not a pumpkin at all, but a beautiful yellow coach.    \"Now bring me four white mice, two large ones and two small ones.\"    In a moment Cinderella brought a trap full of mice into the room.    The fairy waved her golden wand, and the two largest mice were turned  into two snow-white horses.    Two small mice became two men, one a coachman, the other a footman.    \"But how am I to go in these clothes?\" said Cinderella.    \"Ah, let me see,\" said the fairy, and she slowly waved her wand over the  maiden's head.    [Illustration]    Oh, what a change!    The rags tumbled to the floor.    And, what do you think! in their place was a beautiful pink silk dress.    The ugly shoes fell off.    And, lo! a tiny pair of glass slippers were on Cinderella's little feet.    \"Now listen to what I say,\" said the fairy godmother. \"You must not stay  after the clock strikes twelve.    At that time your coach will again be a pumpkin, the men will be mice,  and you will have on your old ragged dress.\"    Cinderella said she would not forget.    Then she jumped into the coach, and away she drove to the king's ball.      CINDERELLA--II    The king's son was charmed with Cinderella.    She was so very beautiful that he would dance with her and with no one  else.    Cinderella had such a good time that she forgot about the clock.    It began to strike twelve--one, two, three.    Cinderella ran from the room.    Down the steps of the palace she flew.    She ran so fast that she lost one of her little glass slippers.    The clock finished striking.    Lo! the coach turned into a pumpkin.    The horses and men turned into mice.    Poor Cinderella had to walk home in her ragged clothes.    The next morning the prince found Cinderella's little glass slipper on  the stairs.    \"There is only one maiden in all the world who can wear so tiny a  slipper,\" said the prince. \"I will marry her and no other.\"    The prince hunted far and wide for a maiden who could put it on. Many  tried, but none could do it.    At last he came to the house where Cinderella lived. The two older  sisters tried and tried to put the slipper on their large feet.    While the prince was waiting, Cinderella came into the room.    \"Let me try it,\" she said.    \"You!\" cried the older sisters. \"You could never put it on.\"    \"Let her try it,\" said the prince.    At once the little glass slipper was fitted to the tiny foot.    [Illustration]    Then Cinderella stood up; her ragged clothes turned into a beautiful  silk dress, and there were two little slippers on her two little feet.    Then the prince knew that Cinderella was the one he had danced with at  the ball, and taking her hand, he led her out to his coach.    Soon they were married and lived happily ever after.    _English Fairy Tale_              RAINDROPS        Oh, where do you come from,        You little drops of rain,      Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,        Down the windowpane?        Tell me, little raindrops,        Is that the way you play?      Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,        All the rainy day?        I sit here at the window;        I've nothing else to do;      Oh, I wish that I could play,        This rainy day, with you!        The little raindrops cannot speak,        But \"pitter-patter-pat\"      Means, \"We can play on this side,        Why can't you play on that?\"        ANN HAWKSHAWE          [Illustration]    THE FOUR FRIENDS--I    comb  music  giants  chief      Once upon a time a man had a donkey.    His donkey had worked for him many years.    At last the donkey grew so old that he was no longer of any use for  work, and his master wished to get rid of him.    The donkey, fearing he might be killed, ran away.    He took the road to Bremen, where he had often heard the street band  playing.    He liked music, so he thought he might join the band.    He had not gone far when he came upon an old dog.    The dog was panting, as if he had been running a long way.    \"Why are you panting, my friend?\" asked the donkey.    \"Ah,\" said the dog, \"I am too old for the hunt. My master wished to have  me killed. So I ran away. But how I am to find bread and meat, I do not  know.\"    \"Well,\" said the donkey, \"come with me. I am going to play in the band  at Bremen. I think you and I can easily earn a living by music. I can  play the lute, and you can play the kettledrum.\"    The dog was quite willing, and so they be walked on.    They had not gone far when they saw a cat sitting in a yard.    He looked as sad as three days of rainy weather.    \"What's the matter with you, old Tom?\" asked the donkey.    \"You would be sad, too,\" said the cat, \"if you were in my place; for now  that I am getting old and cannot catch mice, they wish to drown me. I  have run away, but how I am going to live, I do not know.\"    \"Come with us to Bremen,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to play in the  band.    I know you love music, as you sing so well at night. You too can join  the band.\"    \"That is just what I should like to do,\" said the cat.    So the donkey, the dog, and the cat all walked on together.    [Illustration]    After a time the three came to a farmyard.    There on the gate sat a cock, crying \"Cock-a-doodle-doo\" with all his  might.    \"Why are you making so much noise?\" asked the donkey.    \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"I find I must have my head cut off so that I may  serve as a dinner for Monday. I'm crowing as hard as I can while my head  is still on.\"    \"Come with us, old Red Comb,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to Bremen  to join the band. You have a fine voice. You can join, too.\"    \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"that is just what I should like to do.\"    And they all went on their way to Bremen.      THE FOUR FRIENDS--II    At evening the four friends came to a wood, where they stopped for the  night.    The donkey and the dog lay down under a large tree.    The cat climbed up on one of the branches.    The cock flew to the very top of the tree, where he felt quite safe.    From his perch on the top of the tree the cock saw a light.    Calling to his friends, he said, \"We are not far from a house. I can see  a light.\"    \"Let us go on,\" said the donkey, \"for it may be just the house for us.\"    As they drew near, the light grew larger and brighter.    At last they could see that it came from the window of a robber's house.    The donkey, who was the tallest, went up and looked in.    \"What do you see, old Long Ears?\" asked the cock.    \"What do I see?\" answered the donkey. \"Why, a table spread with plenty  to eat and drink, and the robbers having their supper.\"    \"We should be there, too, if we had our rights,\" said the cock.    \"Ah, yes,\" said the donkey; \"if we could only get inside.\"    Then the four friends talked over what they had better do in order to  drive the robbers out of the house.    At last they hit upon a plan.    The donkey stood upon his hind legs and placed his front feet on the  window sill.    [Illustration]    The dog then stood on the donkey's back    The cat climbed upon the dog, while the cock perched upon the cat's  head.    The donkey gave a signal, and they began all at the same time, to make  their loudest music.    The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed,  all with such force that the windowpane shook and was almost broken.    The robbers had never heard such a noise.    They thought it must come from witches, or giants, or goblins, and they  all ran as fast as they could to the wood behind the house.    Then our four friends rushed in and ate what the robbers had left upon  the table.    It did"]]]
