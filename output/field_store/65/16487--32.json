We had better all go down to the  foyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we will come up again  together.\"    And the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring which she  wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the  tip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew's cross on the  wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand.  She said  to the little ballet-girls:    \"Come, children, pull yourselves together!  I dare say no one has ever  seen the ghost.\"    \"Yes, yes, we saw him--we saw him just now!\" cried the girls.  \"He had  his death's head and his dress-coat, just as when he appeared to Joseph  Buquet!\"    \"And Gabriel saw him too!\" said Jammes.  \"Only yesterday!  Yesterday  afternoon--in broad day-light----\"    \"Gabriel, the chorus-master?\"    \"Why, yes, didn't you know?\"    \"And he was wearing his dress-clothes, in broad daylight?\"    \"Who?  Gabriel?\"    \"Why, no, the ghost!\"    \"Certainly!  Gabriel told me so himself.  That's what he knew him by.  Gabriel was in the stage-manager's office.  Suddenly the door opened  and the Persian entered.  You know the Persian has the evil eye----\"    \"Oh, yes!\" answered the little ballet-girls in chorus, warding off  ill-luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at the absent  Persian, while their second and third fingers were bent on the palm and  held down by the thumb.    \"And you know how superstitious Gabriel is,\" continued Jammes.  \"However, he is always polite.  When he meets the Persian, he just puts  his hand in his pocket and touches his keys.  Well, the moment the  Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump from his chair  to the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch iron!  In doing so, he tore  a whole skirt of his overcoat on a nail.  Hurrying to get out of the  room, he banged his forehead against a hat-peg and gave himself a huge  bump; then, suddenly stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen,  near the piano; he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his  hands and crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a  madman, slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first  flight on his back.  I was just passing with mother.  We picked him up.  He was covered with bruises and his face was all over blood.  We were  frightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank  Providence that he had got off so cheaply.  Then he told us what had  frightened him.  He had seen the ghost behind the Persian, THE GHOST  WITH THE DEATH'S HEAD just like Joseph Buquet's description!\"    Jammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost were at  her heels, and was quite out of breath at the finish.  A silence  followed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great excitement.  It was  broken by little Giry, who said:    \"Joseph Buquet would do better to hold his tongue.\"    \"Why should he hold his tongue?\" asked somebody.    \"That's mother's opinion,\" replied Meg, lowering her voice and looking  all about her as though fearing lest other ears than those present  might overhear.    \"And why is it your mother's opinion?\"    \"Hush!  Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked about.\"    \"And why does your mother say so?\"    \"Because--because--nothing--\"    This reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies, who  crowded round little Giry, begging her to explain herself.  They were  there, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously in one movement of  entreaty and fear, communicating their terror to one another, taking a  keen pleasure in feeling their blood freeze in their veins.    \"I swore not to tell!\" gasped Meg.    But they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret, until Meg,  burning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes fixed on the door:    \"Well, it's because of the private box.\"    \"What private box?\"    \"The ghost's box!\"    \"Has the ghost a box?  Oh, do tell us, do tell us!\"    \"Not so loud!\" said Meg.  \"It's Box Five, you know, the box on the  grand tier, next to the stage-box, on the left.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!\"    \"I tell you it is.  Mother has charge of it.  But you swear you won't  say a word?\"    \"Of course, of course.\"    \"Well, that's the ghost's box.  No one has had it for over a month,  except the ghost, and orders have been given at the box-office that it  must never be sold.\"    \"And does the ghost really come there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then somebody does come?\"    \"Why, no!  The ghost comes, but there is nobody there.\"    The little ballet-girls exchanged glances.  If the ghost came to the  box, he must be seen, because he wore a dress-coat and a death's head.  This was what they tried to make Meg understand, but she replied:    \"That's just it!  The ghost is not seen.  And he has no dress-coat and  no head!  All that talk about his death's head and his head of fire is  nonsense!  There's nothing in it.  You only hear him when he is in the  box.  Mother has never seen him, but she has heard him.  Mother knows,  because she gives him his program.\"    Sorelli interfered.    \"Giry, child, you're getting at us!\"    Thereupon little Giry began to cry.    \"I ought to have held my tongue--if mother ever came to know!  But I  was quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to talk of things that  don't concern him--it will bring him bad luck--mother was saying so  last night----\"    There was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the passage and a  breathless voice cried:    \"Cecile!  Cecile!  Are you there?\"    \"It's mother's voice,\" said Jammes.  \"What's the matter?\"    She opened the door.  A respectable lady, built on the lines of a  Pomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing-room and dropped groaning  into a vacant arm-chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her brick-dust  colored face.    \"How awful!\" she said.  \"How awful!\"    \"What?  What?\"    \"Joseph Buquet!\"    \"What about him?\"    \"Joseph Buquet is dead!\"    The room became filled with exclamations, with astonished outcries,  with scared requests for explanations.    \"Yes, he was found hanging in the third-floor cellar!\"    \"It's the ghost!\" little Giry blurted, as though in spite of herself;  but she at once corrected herself, with her hands pressed to her mouth:  \"No, no!--I, didn't say it!--I didn't say it!----\"    All around her, her panic-stricken companions repeated under their  breaths:    \"Yes--it must be the ghost!\"    Sorelli was very pale.    \"I shall never be able to recite my speech,\" she said.    Ma Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of liqueur that  happened to be standing on a table; the ghost must have something to do  with it.    The truth is that no one ever knew how Joseph Buquet met his death.  The verdict at the inquest was \"natural suicide.\"  In his Memoirs of  Manager, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint managers who succeeded MM.  Debienne and Poligny, describes the incident as follows:    \"A grievous accident spoiled the little party which MM.  Debienne and  Poligny gave to celebrate their retirement.  I was in the manager's  office, when Mercier, the acting-manager, suddenly came darting in.  He  seemed half mad and told me that the body of a scene-shifter had been  found hanging in the third cellar under the stage, between a farm-house  and a scene from the Roi de Lahore.  I shouted:    \"'Come and cut him down!'    \"By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's ladder,  the man was no longer hanging from his rope!\"    So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural.  A man hangs at  the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared.  Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation!  Listen to him:    \"It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls lost no  time in taking their precautions against the evil eye.\"    There you are!  Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob's  ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves in less time  than it takes to write!  When, on the other hand, I think of the exact  spot where the body was discovered--the third cellar underneath the  stage!--imagine that SOMEBODY must have been interested in seeing that  the rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and time will  show if I am wrong.    The horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph Buquet was  very popular.  The dressing-rooms emptied and the ballet-girls,  crowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around their shepherdess, made  for the foyer through the ill-lit passages and staircases, trotting as  fast as their little pink legs could carry them.      [1] I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro  Gailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera.          Chapter II  The New Margarita      On the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny, who was  coming up-stairs. The count, who was generally so calm, seemed greatly  excited.    \"I was just going to you,\" he said, taking off his hat.  \"Oh, Sorelli,  what an evening!  And Christine Daae:  what a triumph!\"    \"Impossible!\" said Meg Giry.  \"Six months ago, she used to sing like a  CROCK!  But do let us get by, my dear count,\" continues the brat, with  a saucy curtsey.  \"We are going to inquire after a poor man who was  found hanging by the neck.\"    Just then the acting-manager came fussing past and stopped when he  heard this remark.    \"What!\" he exclaimed roughly.  \"Have you girls heard already?  Well,  please forget about it for tonight--and above all don't let M. Debienne  and M. Poligny hear; it would upset them too much on their last day.\"    They all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already full of  people.  The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala performance ever  equalled this one.  All the great composers of the day had conducted  their own works in turns.  Faure and Krauss had sung; and, on that  evening, Christine Daae had revealed her true self, for the first time,  to the astonished"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#3)"],[1,"take it for granted that you're her son's child.    \"Or I can pretend I'm poor Granny's lost daughter's little girl,\"  Maida suggested.    \"If you wish. Billy Potter's going to stay here in Boston and help  you. You're to call on him, Posie, if you get into any snarl. But I  hope you'll try to settle all your own difficulties before turning  to anybody else. Do you understand?\"    \"Yes, father. Father, dear, I'm so happy. Does Granny know?\"    \"Yes.\"    Maida heaved an ecstatic sigh. \"I'm afraid I shan't get to sleep  to-night--just thinking of it.\"    But she did sleep and very hard--the best sleep she had known since  her operation. And she dreamed that she opened a shop--a big shop  this was--on the top of a huge white cloud. She dreamed that her  customers were all little boy and girl angels with floating, golden  curls and shining rainbow-colored wings. She dreamed that she sold  nothing but cake. She used to cut generous slices from an angel-cake  as big as the golden dome of the Boston state house. It was very  delicious--all honey and jelly and ice cream on the inside, and all  frosting, stuck with candies and nuts and fruits, on the outside.                            ----------------------    The people on Warrington Street were surprised to learn in the  course of a few days that old Mrs. Murdock had sold out her business  in the little corner store. For over a week, the little place was  shut up. The school children, pouring into the street twice a day,  had to go to Main Street for their candy and lead pencils. For a  long time all the curtains were kept down. Something was going on  inside, but what, could not be guessed from the outside. Wagons  deposited all kinds of things at the door, rolls of paper, tins of  paint, furniture, big wooden boxes whose contents nobody could  guess. Every day brought more and more workmen and the more there  were, the harder they worked. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, all  the work stopped.    The next morning when the neighborhood waked up, a freshly-painted  sign had taken the place over the door of the dingy old black and  white one. The lettering was gilt, the background a skyey blue. It  read:                             MAIDA'S LITTLE SHOP                                   CHAPTER II: CLEANING UP      The next two weeks were the busiest Maida ever knew.    In the first place she must see Mrs. Murdock and talk things over.  In the second place, she must examine all the stock that Mrs.  Murdock left. In the third place, she must order new stock from the  wholesale places. And in the fourth place, the rooms must be made  ready for her and Granny to live in. It was hard work, but it was  great fun.    First, Mrs. Murdock called, at Billy's request, at his rooms on  Mount Vernon Street. Granny and Maida were there to meet her.    Mrs. Murdock was a tall, thin, erect old lady. Her bright black eyes  were piercing enough, but it seemed to Maida that the round-glassed  spectacles, through which she examined them all, were even more so.    \"I've made out a list of things for the shop that I'm all out of,\"  she began briskly. \"You'll know what the rest is from what's left on  the shelves. Now about buying--there's a wagon comes round once a  month and I've told them to keep right on a-coming even though I  ain't there. They'll sell you your candy, pickles, pickled limes and  all sich stuff. You'll have to buy your toys in Boston--your paper,  pens, pencils, rubbers and the like also, but not at the same places  where you git the toys. I've put all the addresses down on the list.  I don't see how you can make any mistakes.\"    \"How long will it take you to get out of the shop?\" Billy asked.    Maida knew that Billy enjoyed Mrs. Murdock, for often, when he  looked at that lady, his eyes \"skrinkled up,\" although there was not  a smile on his face.    \"A week is all I need,\" Mrs. Murdock declared. \"If it worn't for  other folks who are keeping me waiting, I'd have that hull place  fixed as clean as a whistle in two shakes of a lamb's tail. Now I'll  put a price on everything, so's you won't be bothered what to  charge. There's some things I don't ever git, because folks buy too  many of them and it's sich an everlasting bother keeping them in  stock. But you're young and spry, and maybe you won't mind jumping  about for every Tom, Dick and Harry. But, remember,\" she added in  parting, \"don't git expensive things. Folks in that neighborhood  ain't got no money to fool away. Git as many things as you can for a  cent a-piece. Git some for five and less for ten and nothing for  over a quarter. But you must allus callulate to buy some things to  lose money on. I mean the truck you put in the window jess to make  folks look in. It gits dusty and fly-specked before you know it and  there's an end on it. I allus send them to the Home for Little  Wanderers at Christmas time.\"    Early one morning, a week later, a party of three--Granny Flynn,  Billy and Maida--walked up Beacon Street and across the common to the  subway. Maida had never walked so far in her life. But her father  had told her that if she wanted to keep the shop, she must give up  her carriage and her automobile. That was not hard. She was willing  to give up anything that she owned for the little shop.    They left the car at City Square in Charlestown and walked the rest  of the way. It was Saturday, a brilliant morning in a beautiful  autumn. All the children in the neighborhood were out playing. Maida  looked at each one of them as she passed. They seemed as wonderful  as fairy beings to her--for would they not all be her customers soon?  And yet, such was her excitement, she could not remember one face  after she had passed it. A single picture remained in her mind--a  picture of a little girl standing alone in the middle of the court.  Black-haired, black-eyed, a vivid spot of color in a scarlet cape  and a scarlet hat, the child was scattering bread-crumbs to a flock  of pigeons. The pigeons did not seem afraid of her. They flew close  to her feet. One even alighted on her shoulder.    \"It makes me think of St. Mark's in Venice,\" Maida said to Billy.    But, little girl--scarlet cape--flocks of doves--St. Mark's, all went  out of her head entirely when she unlocked the door of the little  shop.    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" she cried, \"how nice and clean it looks!\"    The shop seemed even larger than she remembered it. The confused,  dusty, cluttery look had gone. But with its dull paint and its  blackened ceiling, it still seemed dark and dingy.    Maida ran behind the counter, peeped into the show cases, poked her  head into the window, drew out the drawers that lined the wall,  pulled covers from the boxes on the shelves. There is no knowing  where her investigations would have ended if Billy had not said:    \"See here, Miss Curiosity, we can't put in the whole morning on the  shop. This is a preliminary tour of investigation. Come and see the  rest of it. This way to the living-room!\"    The living-room led from the shop--a big square room, empty now, of  course. Maida limped over to the window. \"Oh, oh, oh!\" she cried;  \"did you ever see such a darling little yard?\"    \"It surely is little,\" Billy agreed, \"not much bigger than a pocket  handkerchief, is it?\"    And yet, scrap of a place as the yard was, it had an air of  completeness, a pretty quaintness. Two tiny brick walks curved from  the door to the gate. On either side of these spread out microscopic  flower-beds, crowded tight with plants. Late-blooming dahlias and  asters made spots of starry color in the green. A vine, running over  the door to the second story, waved like a crimson banner dropped  from the window.    \"The old lady must have been fond of flowers,\" Billy Potter said. He  squinted his near-sighted blue eyes and studied the bunches of  green. \"Syringa bush in one corner. Lilac bush in the other.  Nasturtiums at the edges. Morning-glories running up the fence.  Sunflowers in between. My, won't it be fun to see them all racing up  in the spring!\"    Maida jumped up and down at the thought. She could not jump like  other children. Indeed, this was the first time that she had ever  tried. It was as if her feet were like flat-irons. Granny Flynn  turned quickly away and Billy bit his lips.    \"I know just how I'm going to fix this room up for you, Petronilla,\"  Billy said, nodding his head mysteriously. \"Now let's go into the  kitchen.\"    The kitchen led from the living-room. Billy exclaimed when he saw it  and Maida shook her hands, but it was Granny who actually screamed  with delight.    Much bigger than the living-room, it had four windows with sunshine  pouring in through every one of them. But it was not the four  windows nor yet the sunshine that made the sensation--it was the  stone floor.    \"We'll put a carpet on it if you think it's too cold, Granny,\" Billy  suggested immediately.    \"Oh, lave it be, Misther Billy,\" Granny begged. \"'Tis loike me ould  home in Oireland. Sure 'tis homesick Oi am this very minut looking  at ut.\"    \"All right,\" Billy agreed cheerfully. \"What you say goes, Granny.  Now upstairs to the sleeping-rooms.\"    To get to the second floor they climbed a little stairway not more  than three feet wide, with steps very high, most of them triangular  in shape because the stairway had to turn so often. And  upstairs--after they got there--consisted of three rooms, two big and  square and light, and one smaller and darker.    \"The small room is to be made into a bathroom,\" Billy explained,  \"and these two big ones are to be your bedrooms. Which one will you  have, Maida?\"    Maida examined both rooms carefully. \"Well, I don't care for myself  which I have,\" she said. \"But it does seem as if there were a  teeny-weeny more sun in this one. I think Granny ought to have it, for  she loves the sunshine on her old bones. You know, Billy, Granny and I  have the greatest fun about our bones. Hers are all wrong because "]]]
