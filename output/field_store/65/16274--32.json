She was woman enough to realize that there  might well be facts which would only make her situation harder.    \"Wilson,\" she began, hurriedly, \"I owe all I am to dad. He has cared for  me--sent me to school. He has been so good to me. I've loved him always.  It would be a shabby return for all his protection and love if--if I  refused--\"    \"Old Bill is the best man ever,\" interrupted Moore, as if to repudiate  any hint of disloyalty to his employer. \"Everybody in Middle Park and  all over owes Bill something. He's sure good. There never was anything  wrong with him except his crazy blindness about his son. Buster  Jack--the--the--\"    Columbine put a hand over Moore's lips.    \"The man I must marry,\" she said, solemnly.    \"You must--you will?\" he demanded.    \"Of course. What else could I do? I never thought of refusing.\"    \"Columbine!\" Wilson's cry was so poignant, his gesture so violent, his  dark eyes so piercing that Columbine sustained a shock that held her  trembling and mute. \"How can you love Jack Belllounds? You were twelve  years old when you saw him last. How can you love him?\"    \"I don't\" replied Columbine.    \"Then how could you marry him?\"    \"I owe dad obedience. It's his hope that I can steady Jack.\"    \"_Steady Jack!_\" exclaimed Moore, passionately. \"Why, you girl--you  white-faced flower! _You_ with your innocence and sweetness steady that  damned pup! My Heavens! He was a gambler and a drunkard. He--\"    \"Hush!\" implored Columbine.    \"He cheated at cards,\" declared the cowboy, with a scorn that placed  that vice as utterly base.    \"But Jack was only a wild boy,\" replied Columbine, trying with brave  words to champion the son of the man she loved as her father. \"He has  been sent away to work. He'll have outgrown that wildness. He'll come  home a man.\"    \"Bah!\" cried Moore, harshly.    Columbine felt a sinking within her. Where was her strength? She, who  could walk and ride so many miles, to become sick with an inward  quaking! It was childish. She struggled to hide her weakness from him.    \"It's not like you to be this way,\" she said. \"You used to be generous.  Am I to blame? Did I choose my life?\"    Moore looked quickly away from her, and, standing with a hand on his  horse, he was silent for a moment. The squaring of his shoulders bore  testimony to his thought. Presently he swung up into the saddle. The  mustang snorted and champed the bit and tossed his head, ready to bolt.    \"Forget my temper,\" begged the cowboy, looking down upon Columbine. \"I  take it all back. I'm sorry. Don't let a word of mine worry you. I was  only jealous.\"    \"Jealous!\" exclaimed Columbine, wonderingly.    \"Yes. That makes a fellow see red and green. Bad medicine! You never  felt it.\"    \"What were you jealous of?\" asked Columbine.    The cowboy had himself in hand now and he regarded her with a grim  amusement.    \"Well, Columbine, it's like a story,\" he replied. \"I'm the fellow  disowned by his family--a wanderer of the wilds--no good--and no  prospects.... Now our friend Jack, he's handsome and rich. He has a  doting old dad. Cattle, horses--ranches! He wins the girl. See!\"    Spurring his mustang, the cowboy rode away. At the edge of the slope he  turned in the saddle. \"I've got to drive in this bunch of cattle. It's  late. You hurry home.\" Then he was gone. The stones cracked and rolled  down under the side of the bluff.    Columbine stood where he had left her: dubious, yet with the blood still  hot in her cheeks.    \"Jealous?... He wins the girl?\" she murmured in repetition to herself.  \"What ever could he have meant? He didn't mean--he didn't--\"    The simple, logical interpretation of Wilson's words opened Columbine's  mind to a disturbing possibility of which she had never dreamed. That  he might love her! If he did, why had he not said so? Jealous, maybe,  but he did not love her! The next throb of thought was like a knock at a  door of her heart--a door never yet opened, inside which seemed a  mystery of feeling, of hope, despair, unknown longing, and clamorous  voices. The woman just born in her, instinctive and self-preservative,  shut that door before she had more than a glimpse inside. But then she  felt her heart swell with its nameless burdens.    Pronto was grazing near at hand. She caught him and mounted. It struck  her then that her hands were numb with cold. The wind had ceased  fluttering the aspens, but the yellow leaves were falling, rustling. Out  on the brow of the slope she faced home and the west.    A glorious Colorado sunset had just reached the wonderful height of its  color and transformation. The sage slopes below her seemed rosy velvet;  the golden aspens on the farther reaches were on fire at the tips; the  foothills rolled clear and mellow and rich in the light; the gulf of  distance on to the great black range was veiled in mountain purple; and  the dim peaks beyond the range stood up, sunset-flushed and grand. The  narrow belt of blue sky between crags and clouds was like a river full  of fleecy sails and wisps of silver. Above towered a pall of dark cloud,  full of the shades of approaching night.    \"Oh, beautiful!\" breathed the girl, with all her worship of nature. That  wild world of sunset grandeur and loneliness and beauty was hers. Over  there, under a peak of the black range, was the place where she had been  found, a baby, lost in the forest. She belonged to that, and so it  belonged to her. Strength came to her from the glory of light on  the hills.    Pronto shot up his ears and checked his trot.    \"What is it, boy?\" called Columbine. The trail was getting dark.  Shadows were creeping up the slope as she rode down to meet them. The  mustang had keen sight and scent. She reined him to a halt.    All was silent. The valley had begun to shade on the far side and the  rose and gold seemed fading from the nearer. Below, on the level floor  of the valley, lay the rambling old ranch-house, with the cabins  nestling around, and the corrals leading out to the soft hay-fields,  misty and gray in the twilight. A single light gleamed. It was like  a beacon.    The air was cold with a nip of frost. From far on the other side of the  ridge she had descended came the bawls of the last straggling cattle of  the round-up. But surely Pronto had not shot up his ears for them. As if  in answer a wild sound pealed down the slope, making the mustang jump.  Columbine had heard it before.    \"Pronto, it's only a wolf,\" she soothed him.    The peal was loud, rather harsh at first, then softened to a mourn,  wild, lonely, haunting. A pack of coyotes barked in angry answer, a  sharp, staccato, yelping chorus, the more piercing notes biting on the  cold night air. These mountain mourns and yelps were music to Columbine.  She rode on down the trail in the gathering darkness, less afraid of the  night and its wild denizens than of what awaited her at White  Slides Ranch.        CHAPTER II    Darkness settled down like a black mantle over the valley. Columbine  rather hoped to find Wilson waiting to take care of her horse, as used  to be his habit, but she was disappointed. No light showed from the  cabin in which the cowboys lived; he had not yet come in from the  round-up. She unsaddled, and turned Pronto loose in the pasture.    The windows of the long, low ranch-house were bright squares in the  blackness, sending cheerful rays afar. Columbine wondered in trepidation  if Jack Belllounds had come home. It required effort of will to approach  the house. Yet since she must meet him, the sooner the ordeal was over  the better. Nevertheless she tiptoed past the bright windows, and went  all the length of the long porch, and turned around and went back, and  then hesitated, fighting a slow drag of her spirit, an oppression upon  her heart. The door was crude and heavy. It opened hard.    Columbine entered a big room lighted by a lamp on the upper table and by  blazing logs in a huge stone fireplace. This was the living-room, rather  gloomy in the corners, and bare, but comfortable, for all simple needs.  The logs were new and the chinks between them filled with clay, still  white, showing that the house was of recent build.    The rancher, Belllounds, sat in his easy-chair before the fire, his big,  horny hands extended to the warmth. He was in his shirt-sleeves, a  gray, bold-faced man, of over sixty years, still muscular and rugged.    At Columbine's entrance he raised his drooping head, and so removed the  suggestion of sadness in his posture.    \"Wal, lass, hyar you are,\" was his greeting. \"Jake has been hollerin'  thet chuck was ready. Now we can eat.\"    \"Dad--did--did your son come?\" asked Columbine.    \"No. I got word jest at sundown. One of Baker's cowpunchers from up the  valley. He rode up from Kremmlin' an' stopped to say Jack was  celebratin' his arrival by too much red liquor. Reckon he won't be home  to-night. Mebbe to-morrow.\"    Belllounds spoke in an even, heavy tone, without any apparent feeling.  Always he was mercilessly frank and never spared the truth. But  Columbine, who knew him well, felt how this news flayed him. Resentment  stirred in her toward the wayward son, but she knew better than to  voice it.    \"Natural like, I reckon, fer Jack to feel gay on gettin' home. I ain't  holdin' thet ag'in' him. These last three years must have been gallin'  to thet boy.\"    Columbine stretched her hands to the blaze.    \"It's cold, dad,\" she averred. \"I didn't dress warmly, so I nearly  froze. Autumn is here and there's frost in the air. Oh, the hills were  all gold and red--the aspen leaves were falling. I love autumn, but it  means winter is so near.\"    \"Wal, wal, time flies,\" sighed the old man. \"Where'd you ride?\"    \"Up the west slope to the bluff. It's far. I don't go there often.\"    \"Meet any of the boys? I sent the outfit to drive stock down from the  mountain.

The imputation itself, which is unjust and groundless;  II. The pretended ground hereof, which is false or frivolous.    I. The imputation itself is, that the presbyterial government is likely  to be an arbitrary and tyrannical government. _Ans_. How unjust this  aspersion! I. What likelihood of arbitrary conduct in this government,  that is, that it should be managed and carried on according to men's  mere will and pleasure? For, 1. The presbyterial government (truly so  called) is not in the nature of it any invention of man, but an  ordinance of Christ; nor in the execution of it to be stated by the will  of man, but only by the sure word of prophecy, the sacred Scriptures.  This government allows not of one church officer at all; nor of one  ruling assembly made up of those officers; nor of one censure or act of  power to be done by any officer or assembly; nor of one ordinance to be  managed in the Church of God, but what are grounded upon, and warranted  by the word of God. This government allows no execution of any part  thereof, neither in substantials, nor circumstantials, but according to  the particular, or at least, the general rules of Scripture  respectively. And can that be arbitrary, which is not at all according  to man's will, but only according to Christ's rule, limiting and  ordering man's will? Or is not the Scripture a better and safer  provision against all arbitrary government in the Church, than all the  ordinances, decrees, statutes, or whatsoever municipal laws in the world  of man's devising, can be against all arbitrary government in the  commonwealth? Let not men put out their own eyes, though others would  cast a mist before them. 2. Who can justly challenge the reformed  presbyterial churches for arbitrary proceedings in matters of church  government, practised in some of them for above these fourscore years?  Or where are their accusers? 3. Why should the presbyterial  government, to be erected in England, be prejudged as arbitrary, before  the government be put in execution? When arbitrary conduct appears, let  the adversaries complain. 4. If any arbitrary conduct hath been  discovered in any reformed church, or shall fall out in ours, it is or  shall be more justly reputed the infirmity and fault of the governors,  than of the government itself.    II. What probability or possibility of tyranny in the presbyterial  government? For, 1. Who should tyrannize, what persons, what ruling  assemblies? Not the ministers; for, hitherto they have given no just  cause of any suspicion, since this government was in hand: and they are  counterpoised in all assemblies with a plurality of ruling elders, it  being already studiously[3] provided that there be always two ruling  elders to one minister: if there be still two to one, how should they  tyrannize if they would? Neither ministers nor ruling elders are likely  to tyrannize, if due care be taken by them, whom it doth concern, to  elect, place, and appoint, conscientious, prudent, and gracious  ministers and ruling elders over all congregations. Nor yet the ruling  assemblies, lesser or greater; for in the presbyterial government all  lesser ruling assemblies (though now at first, perhaps, some of them  consisting of more weak and less experienced members) are subordinate to  the greater authoritatively; and persons aggrieved by any  mal-administrations have liberty to appeal from inferior to superior:  and the very national assembly itself, though not properly subordinate,  yet is it to be responsible to the supreme political magistracy in all  their proceedings so far as subjects and members of the commonwealth.    III. How can they tyrannize over any? Or in what respects? Not over  their estates: for they claim no secular power at all over men's  estates, by fines, penalties, forfeitures, or confiscations. Not over  their bodies, for they inflict no corporal punishment, by banishment,  imprisonment, branding, slitting, cropping, striking, whipping,  dismembering, or killing. Not over their souls; for, them they desire by  this government to gain, Matth. xviii. 15; to edify, 2 Cor. x. 8, and  xiii. 10; and to save, 1 Cor. v. 5. Only this government ought to be  impartial and severe against sin, that the flesh may be destroyed, 1  Cor. v. 5. It is only destructive to corruption, which is deadly and  destructive to the soul. Thus the imputation itself of arbitrary conduct  and tyranny to the presbyterial government is unjust and groundless.    II. The pretended ground of this aspersion is false and frivolous. The  presbyters of the Assembly of Divines, and others (_Diotrephes_-like,  affecting pre-eminence) have desired an unlimited power, according to  their own prudence and judgment, in keeping men from the ordinances in  cases of scandal not enumerated. _Ans_. 1. The presbyters of the  Assembly and others, are so far from the domineering humor of  Diotrephes, that they could gladly and heartily have quitted all  intermeddling in church government, if Jesus Christ had not by office  engaged them thereto; only to have dispensed the word and sacraments  would have procured them less hatred, and more case. 2. They desired  liberty to keep from the ordinances, not only persons guilty of the  scandals enumerated, but of all such like scandals, (and to judge which  are those scandals, not according to their minds unlimitedly, but  according to the mind of Christ in his word, more sure than all  ordinances or acts of Parliament in the world.) And was this so hideous  a desire? This liberty was desired, not for themselves, but for  well-constituted elderships. As great power was granted by the very  service-book to every single curate; (see the Rubric before the  communion.) A perfect enumeration and description of scandals can be  made in no book but in the Scriptures; and when all is done, must we not  refer thither? All scandals are punishable, as well as any, and to  inflict penalties on some, and not on others as bad or worse, is  inexcusable partiality. Why should not presbyteries duly constituted,  especially the greater, be accounted, at least, as faithful,  intelligent, prudent, and every way as competent judges of what is  scandal, and what not, according to the Scriptures, and that without  arbitrary conduct and tyranny, as any civil court, committees, or  commissioners whatsoever? Ruling church assemblies are intrusted with  the whole government in the church, consequently with this, and every  part. The best reformed churches allow to their presbyteries power to  keep from the ordinances scandalous persons, not only for scandals  enumerated, but for scandals of like nature not enumerated, with some  general clause or other, as may appear in eight several churches,  according to the allegations here in the foot-note;[4] and, therefore,  no new thing is desired, but what is commonly practised in the reformed  churches, whom we should imitate so far as they lead us on towards  purity and perfection.    _Doubt_ 3. But the independent government seems to be a far more  excellent way, and it is embraced by many godly and precious people and  ministers.    _Ans_. 1. What true excellency is there at all in the whole independent  government, save only in those particulars wherein it agrees with the  presbyterial government; and only so far as it is presbyterial?  Therefore, the presbyterial government is equally, yea, primarily and  principally excellent. Wherein is the excellency of the independent way  of government? 1st. Have they only those officers which Christ himself  hath appointed, pastors and teachers, ruling elders and deacons? So the  Presbyterians. 2d. Have they those spiritual censures, of admonishing,  excommunicating, and receiving again into communion, which Christ  ordained in his Church, for guarding his ordinances, and well guiding of  the flock? So the Presbyterians. 3d. Have they congregational  presbyteries duly elected, and constituted for the exercise of all acts  of government, proper and necessary for their respective congregations?  So the Presbyterians. 4th. Have they liberty of electing their own[5]  officers, pastors, elders, and deacons? So the Presbyterians. 5th. Have  they power to keep the whole lump of the Church from being leavened, and  purely to preserve the ordinances of Christ, from pollution and  profanation, &c.? So the Presbyterians, &c. So that whereinsoever the  independent government is truly excellent, the presbyterial government  stands in a full equipage and equality of excellence.    II. What one true excellence is there in the whole independent  government in any one point, wherein it really differs from the  presbyterial government? Take for instance a few points of difference.    _In the independent government._        No other visible Church of Christ is acknowledged, but only a single      congregational meeting in one place to partake of all ordinances.        The matter of their visible Church must be to their utmost judgment      of discerning such as have true grace, real saints.        Their churches are gathered out of other true visible churches of      Christ, without any leave or consent of pastor or flock; yea,      against their wills, receiving such as tender themselves, yea, too      often by themselves or others, directly or indirectly seducing      disciples after them.        Preaching elders are only elected, not ordained.        Ruling elders also preach.        The subject of church government is the community of the faithful.        The church officers act immediately as the servants of the church,      and deputed thereby.        All censures and acts of government are dispensed in single      congregations ultimately, independently, without all liberty of      appeal from them to any superior church assembly; so the parties      grieved are left without remedy.
