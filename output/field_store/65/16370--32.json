[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15561"],[0,"The Boer in Peace and War (#3)"],[1,". The Boer's  diplomacy is weak, and he falls into the trap. He has fifty cattle to  dispose of; the merchant buys them, and the overdue account, with  interest, is paid.    The Boers are very superstitious in a great many things. For instance,  they regard locusts as a direct visitation from the Almighty. When the  pest settles down upon ground occupied by Kaffirs, all the available  tin cans and empty paraffin tins are requisitioned, and there is a  mighty noise, that ought to frighten off any respectable locust swarm;  but the Boer, when he sees them coming, goes into his house and lays  hold of his Bible, and reads and prays until he thinks there ought to  be some good result. The Boer is gifted with great and abiding  patience (in such cases only), and, no matter if the locusts stop long  enough to eat up every green blade on his farm, he will continue to  study his Bible and pray. But, as I have remarked parenthetically, it  is only in cases of emergency where he evinces such a display of  patience and exercises such a pious disposition. When he is not  praying, he is putting ten-pound stones in his bales of wool to be  ready for the merchant's scales, and transacting other little matters  of business of a like nature.    The Boer is not particular in the matter of cleanliness. It suits him  just as well to be dirty as to be clean. It is no exaggeration to say  that numbers of Boers do not wash themselves from one week's end to  another; and they wear their clothes until they drop off. It is always  a matter for speculation what the womenfolks do. It is certain that  they do not exert themselves too much, if at all, in their own homes.  They generally do all the cooking and eating in one room, and in the  other end of the house you will probably find a litter of pigs, a  score of hens, etc. And the one room is about as clean as the  other--most people would prefer to sleep alongside the pigs and the  fowls.    The most painful proceeding is to dine in such a place. Unless you are  blessed with a cast-iron constitution and a stomach of the same  pattern, you are not likely to survive. Usually they put down boiled  meat first, after which comes the soup. The chief regret in your case  is that the soup had not come first, so that you could have disposed  of it right away and had something on top of it. Coffee, of course, is  never forgotten, and it would be a direct insult to refuse it. Coffee  is a great thing with the Boer. He would as soon be without house and  home, as his bag of coffee. Before selling his wool to the merchant,  almost the first thing he asks is: 'What is your price for coffee?' If  a satisfactory quotation is forthcoming, he does not hesitate long in  disposing of his staple, although, of course, at the highest price  obtainable.    The story goes that once upon a time a Boer, whose conscience had  remained dormant from his birth, came to a certain town to purchase  goods in exchange for produce. One of the articles he bought was,  naturally, coffee, and of that he took half a bag. While the clerk was  engaged in attending to some other matters, the Boer quietly and, as  he thought, unobserved, undid the cord which secured the mouth of the  coffee bag, and slipped in a quarter of a hundred-weight of lead which  was lying in the vicinity and which he evidently calculated on finding  useful. The clerk observed this movement without betraying the fact,  and when the order was completed his eye fell upon the coffee bag  casually.    'Oh! wait a moment,' he remarked. 'I fancy I have forgotten to weigh  that coffee.'    He weighed it over again and carefully noted down the figures in his  little book, no doubt much to the chagrin of the silent Boer, who  probably had not reckoned on paying for his lead in the same  proportion as the cost of his coffee per pound.    On another occasion, a Boer, the extent of whose wealth was probably  unknown to himself, found it necessary to dispute certain items in his  account with his storekeeper. This sort of thing, by the way, is the  rule and by no means the exception. It seems natural also when it is  noted that the majority of Boers run twelve-monthly accounts, and by  the time they come to square up, they find a difficulty in recognising  some of the articles purchased eleven or twelve months previously.  This particular gentleman's argument had reference to a pair of spurs,  which he deposed had been given to him as a present by the manager,  and his hitherto good opinion of the clerk who had charged the spurs  in his account was permanently damaged. He said he wasn't a man of  that sort. If he wanted to buy spurs, he could pay cash down for about  fifteen thousand pairs and, in short, he could buy up all the spurs in  the country! He would pay for those spurs now: he wouldn't take a pair  of anything, gratis or otherwise, from that merchant as long as he  lived. He would go home and put eight horses into his wagonette and  drive round the country and tell all his friends about that pair of  spurs, and he wouldn't rest until he had completed the task to his own  satisfaction.    The book-keeper tried in vain to calm him down by presenting him with  a bunch of grapes, but he only regarded the peace-offering with  extreme contempt. He wanted to know what else he had been charged  with, and the clerk, in conciliatory tones, proceeded to read over the  several items. He came to 'one pound of tea.' That was the last straw.    'What! a pound of tea--a pound! Almachtig! Ik koop thee bij de zak (I  buy tea by the bag).'    The suspicious nature of the Boer is always in evidence, although the  Englishman must perforce humour it. It would be interesting to learn,  for instance, how many thousands of pounds are sewn up in mattresses  all over the country because the owners are chary concerning the  integrity of bank-managers. They have no doubt whatever but that a  bank is a paying concern (one Boer entered a bank recently and  wanted to see the place where they made the money), but they would  much rather keep their own money out of it, in case it should get  mixed up with the earnings and savings of other people and be lost.  The story runs that one old vrouw journeyed to town in her waggon one  day for the express purpose of depositing L300 with the local bank,  but when she found that they wanted to give her so much for keeping it  (interest) instead of asking her to pay a small amount by way of  compensation for taking charge of her money, she became suspicious and  took her L300 back to the farm and the double grass mattress once  more. It is unnecessary to state that this particular lady never  trusted another banking institution.    [Illustration: WAGGONS CROSSING RIVER]    And so it is with other things. When once you have aroused suspicion  in the Boer--and it sleeps lightly--you can safely say good-bye to him  for ever. He knows within his heart that the English are bent upon  taking advantage of him, and when a man makes up his mind like that  he is seldom disappointed.    There is one characteristic of the Boer which the most casual observer  cannot fail to notice. It is his entire indifference to personal  appearance. He likes to see his vrouw gorgeous in all the colours of  the rainbow (pink and green being the favourites), and he doesn't mind  if the material costs a little over ninepence a yard; but he evinces  no desire to discard the suit he has himself worn for three or four  years without a change. So long as it holds together, he is content to  wear it, and he does not in the least mind what other people may say  about it. It may be supposed that this applies exclusively to the  poorer classes, but I can assure my readers that I have known it to be  the case with scores of men who could well afford to wear a brand-new  suit every day of the week and every month of the year. And what does  this characteristic indicate? It indicates the man. He has no desire  to advance beyond what he is--what his forefathers were. The latter  manufactured their own clothing; they made their own shoes, and, had  they been presented with a cast-off suit belonging to the Prince of  Wales, they could not possibly have appreciated it, and they certainly  would never have thought of wearing it. The Boer does not care to  dress respectably; he prefers to finger the coin and sit down and  watch the increase in his stock. He would have everything converted  into stock, because that is his great ambition.    Another thing--he lacks taste. His clothes never by any chance fit him  (in the eyes of more refined people), and his boots are always three  sizes too large; but then he thinks he is getting more for his money.  If he must needs buy boots, he takes care that he invests his money in  quantity, not quality, or style.          CHAPTER III      The Boer would like to lay hands on the man who invented ploughs. Not  that he has any aversion to ploughs as ploughs; he merely objects to  the labour involved by the introduction of these implements into the  market. He sees some sense in an ox, a sheep, a goat, and a horse. Put  these animals on a bit of green veldt, and they do the rest  themselves; they thrive and multiply, and enhance the position of  their owner. But a plough! It means that he requires to take off his  coat and stop doing nothing. The Boer would like to argue that if God  had meant the soil to be disturbed by ploughs and such like, He would  not have left the solution of this problem in the hands of mere  inventors: He would have ordained a means whereby the soil would have  of itself turned over once a year at springtime.    The Boers are a pastoral people--one can hardly say an agricultural  people. They have been that sort of people from the start, and they  will never change. They are used to waggons and oxen and sheep, and  the waggons and oxen and sheep have got quite used to them.

For this know, Myles, a man cannot do in the world without  money. Thy father hath it ready for thee in the chest, and will give it  thee to-morrow ere thou goest.\"    Lord Falworth had the grim strength of manhood's hard sense to upbear  him in sending his son into the world, but the poor lady mother had  nothing of that to uphold her. No doubt it was as hard then as it is  now for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift for  itself. What tears were shed, what words of love were spoken to the only  man-child, none but the mother and the son ever knew.    The next morning Myles and the old bowman rode away, and no doubt to  the boy himself the dark shadows of leave-taking were lost in the golden  light of hope as he rode out into the great world to seek his fortune.        CHAPTER 3    WHAT MYLES remembered of Falworth loomed great and grand and big, as  things do in the memory of childhood, but even memory could not make  Falworth the equal of Devlen Castle, when, as he and Diccon Bowman rode  out of Devlentown across the great, rude stone bridge that spanned the  river, he first saw, rising above the crowns of the trees, those  huge hoary walls, and the steep roofs and chimneys clustered thickly  together, like the roofs and chimneys of a town.    The castle was built upon a plateau-like rise of ground, which was  enclosed by the outer wall. It was surrounded on three sides by a  loop-like bend of the river, and on the fourth was protected by a deep,  broad, artificial moat, almost as wide as the stream from which it was  fed. The road from the town wound for a little distance along by the  edge of this moat. As Myles and the old bowman galloped by, with the  answering echo of their horses' hoof-beats rattling back from the smooth  stone face of the walls, the lad looked up, wondering at the height and  strength of the great ancient fortress. In his air-castle building Myles  had pictured the Earl receiving him as the son of his one-time comrade  in arms--receiving him, perhaps, with somewhat of the rustic warmth that  he knew at Crosbey-Dale; but now, as he stared at those massive walls  from below, and realized his own insignificance and the greatness of  this great Earl, he felt the first keen, helpless ache of homesickness  shoot through his breast, and his heart yearned for Crosbey-Holt again.    Then they thundered across the bridge that spanned the moat, and through  the dark shadows of the great gaping gate-way, and Diccon, bidding him  stay for a moment, rode forward to bespeak the gate-keeper.    The gate-keeper gave the two in charge of one of the men-at-arms who  were lounging upon a bench in the archway, who in turn gave them into  the care of one of the house-servants in the outer court-yard. So,  having been passed from one to another, and having answered many  questions, Myles in due time found himself in the outer waiting-room  sitting beside Diccon Bowman upon a wooden bench that stood along the  wall under the great arch of a glazed window.    For a while the poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered. He was aware  of people coming and going; he was aware of talk and laughter sounding  around him; but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness and  the oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this great  castle.    Meantime old Diccon Bowman was staring about him with huge interest,  every now and then nudging his young master, calling his attention now  to this and now to that, until at last the lad began to awaken somewhat  from his despondency to the things around. Besides those servants and  others who came and went, and a knot of six or eight men-at-arms with  bills and pole-axes, who stood at the farther door-way talking together  in low tones, now and then broken by a stifled laugh, was a group of  four young squires, who lounged upon a bench beside a door-way hidden by  an arras, and upon them Myles's eyes lit with a sudden interest. Three  of the four were about his own age, one was a year or two older, and  all four were dressed in the black-and-yellow uniform of the house of  Beaumont.    Myles plucked the bowman by the sleeve. \"Be they squires, Diccon?\" said  he, nodding towards the door.    \"Eh?\" said Diccon. \"Aye; they be squires.\"    \"And will my station be with them?\" asked the boy.    \"Aye; an the Earl take thee to service, thou'lt haply be taken as  squire.\"    Myles stared at them, and then of a sudden was aware that the young men  were talking of him. He knew it by the way they eyed him askance, and  spoke now and then in one another's ears. One of the four, a gay young  fellow, with long riding-boots laced with green laces, said a few words,  the others gave a laugh, and poor Myles, knowing how ungainly he must  seem to them, felt the blood rush to his cheeks, and shyly turned his  head.    Suddenly, as though stirred by an impulse, the same lad who had just  created the laugh arose from the bench, and came directly across the  room to where Myles and the bowman sat.    \"Give thee good-den,\" said he. \"What be'st thy name and whence comest  thou, an I may make bold so to ask?\"    \"My name is Myles Falworth,\" said Myles; \"and I come from Crosbey-Dale  bearing a letter to my Lord.\"    \"Never did I hear of Crosbey-Dale,\" said the squire. \"But what seekest  here, if so be I may ask that much?\"    \"I come seeking service,\" said Myles, \"and would enter as an esquire  such as ye be in my Lord's household.\"    Myles's new acquaintance grinned. \"Thou'lt make a droll squire to wait  in a Lord's household,\" said he. \"Hast ever been in such service?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I have only been at school, and learned Latin and  French and what not. But Diccon Bowman here hath taught me use of arms.\"    The young squire laughed outright. \"By'r Lady, thy talk doth tickle  me, friend Myles,\" said he. \"Think'st thou such matters will gain thee  footing here? But stay! Thou didst say anon that thou hadst a letter to  my Lord. From whom is it?\"    \"It is from my father,\" said Myles. \"He is of noble blood, but fallen in  estate. He is a kinsman of my Lord's, and one time his comrade in arms.\"    \"Sayst so?\" said the other. \"Then mayhap thy chances are not so  ill, after all.\" Then, after a moment, he added: \"My name is Francis  Gascoyne, and I will stand thy friend in this matter. Get thy letter  ready, for my Lord and his Grace of York are within and come forth anon.  The Archbishop is on his way to Dalworth, and my Lord escorts him so far  as Uppingham. I and those others are to go along. Dost thou know my Lord  by sight?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I know him not.\"    \"Then I will tell thee when he cometh. Listen!\" said he, as a confused  clattering sounded in the court-yard without. \"Yonder are the horses  now. They come presently. Busk thee with thy letter, friend Myles.\"    The attendants who passed through the anteroom now came and went more  hurriedly, and Myles knew that the Earl must be about to come forth.  He had hardly time to untie his pouch, take out the letter, and tie the  strings again when the arras at the door-way was thrust suddenly aside,  and a tall thin squire of about twenty came forth, said some words to  the young men upon the bench, and then withdrew again. Instantly the  squires arose and took their station beside the door-way. A sudden hush  fell upon all in the room, and the men-at-arms stood in a line against  the wall, stiff and erect as though all at once transformed to figures  of iron. Once more the arras was drawn back, and in the hush Myles heard  voices in the other room.    \"My Lord cometh,\" whispered Gascoyne in his ear, and Myles felt his  heart leap in answer.    The next moment two noblemen came into the anteroom followed by a crowd  of gentlemen, squires, and pages. One of the two was a dignitary of the  Church; the other Myles instantly singled out as the Earl of Mackworth.        CHAPTER 4    He was a tall man, taller even than Myles's father. He had a thin  face, deep-set bushy eyebrows, and a hawk nose. His upper lip was clean  shaven, but from his chin a flowing beard of iron-gray hung nearly to  his waist. He was clad in a riding-gown of black velvet that hung a  little lower than the knee, trimmed with otter fur and embroidered with  silver goshawks--the crest of the family of Beaumont.    A light shirt of link mail showed beneath the gown as he walked, and a  pair of soft undressed leather riding-boots were laced as high as the  knee, protecting his scarlet hose from mud and dirt. Over his shoulders  he wore a collar of enamelled gold, from which hung a magnificent  jewelled pendant, and upon his fist he carried a beautiful Iceland  falcon.    As Myles stood staring, he suddenly heard Gascoyne's voice whisper in  his ear, \"Yon is my Lord; go forward and give him thy letter.\"    Scarcely knowing what he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine,  his heart pounding within him and a great humming in his ears. As he  drew near, the nobleman stopped for a moment and stared at him, and  Myles, as in a dream, kneeled, and presented the letter. The Earl took  it in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer,  then at the packet, and then at the bearer again.    \"Who art thou?\" said he; \"and what is the matter thou wouldst have of  me?\"    \"I am Myles Falworth,\" said the lad, in a low voice; \"and I come seeking  service with you.\"    The Earl drew his thick eyebrows quickly together, and shot a keen  look at the lad. \"Falworth?\" said he, sharply--\"Falworth? I know no  Falworth!\"    \"The letter will tell you,\" said Myles. \"It is from one once dear to  you.\"    The Earl took the letter, and handing it to a gentleman who stood near,  bade him break the seal. \"Thou mayst stand,\" said he to Myles; \"needst  not kneel there forever.\" Then, taking the opened parchment again, he  glanced first at the face and then at the back,"]]]
