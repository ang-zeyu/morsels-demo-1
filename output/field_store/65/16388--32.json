But it  was always thought too hard that he should never meet the rest of us,  except to touch hats, and we finally sank into one system. He was not  permitted to talk with the men, unless an officer was by. With officers  he had unrestrained intercourse, as far as they and he chose. But he  grew shy, though he had favorites: I was one. Then the captain always  asked him to dinner on Monday. Every mess in succession took up the  invitation in its turn. According to the size of the ship, you had him  at your mess more or less often at dinner. His breakfast he ate in his  own state-room,--he always had a state-room,--which was where a sentinel  or somebody on the watch could see the door. And whatever else he ate or  drank, he ate or drank alone. Sometimes, when the marines or sailors had  any special jollification, they were permitted to invite  \"Plain-Buttons,\" as they called him. Then Nolan was sent with some  officer, and the men were forbidden to speak of home while he was  there. I believe the theory that the sight of his punishment did them  good. They called him \"Plain-Buttons,\" because, while he always chose to  wear a regulation army-uniform, he was not permitted to wear the  army-button, for the reason that it bore either the initials or the  insignia of the country he had disowned.    I remember, soon after I joined the navy, I was on shore with some of  the older officers from our ship and from the Brandywine, which we had  met at Alexandria. We had leave to make a party and go up to Cairo and  the Pyramids. As we jogged along (you went on donkeys then), some of the  gentlemen (we boys called them \"Dons,\" but the phrase was long since  changed) fell to talking about Nolan, and some one told the system which  was adopted from the first about his books and other reading. As he was  almost never permitted to go on shore, even though the vessel lay in  port for months, his time at the best hung heavy; and everybody was  permitted to lend him books, if they were not published in America and  made no allusion to it. These were common enough in the old days, when  people in the other hemisphere talked of the United States as little as  we do of Paraguay. He had almost all the foreign papers that came into  the ship, sooner or later; only somebody must go over them first, and  cut out any advertisement or stray paragraph that alluded to America.  This was a little cruel sometimes, when the back of what was cut out  might be as innocent as Hesiod. Right in the midst of one of Napoleon's  battles, or one of Canning's speeches, poor Nolan would find a great  hole, because on the back of the page of that paper there had been an  advertisement of a packet for New York, or a scrap from the President's  message. I say this was the first time I ever heard of this plan, which  afterwards I had enough and more than enough to do with. I remember it,  because poor Phillips, who was of the party, as soon as the allusion to  reading was made, told a story of something which happened at the Cape  of Good Hope on Nolan's first voyage; and it is the only thing I ever  knew of that voyage. They had touched at the Cape, and had done the  civil thing with the English Admiral and the fleet, and then, leaving  for a long cruise up the Indian Ocean, Phillips had borrowed a lot of  English books from an officer, which, in those days, as indeed in these,  was quite a windfall. Among them, as the Devil would order, was the \"Lay  of the Last Minstrel,\" which they had all of them heard of, but which  most of them had never seen. I think it could not have been published  long. Well, nobody thought there could be any risk of anything national  in that, though Phillips swore old Shaw had cut out the \"Tempest\" from  Shakespeare before he let Nolan have it, because he said \"the Bermudas  ought to be ours, and, by Jove, should be one day.\" So Nolan was  permitted to join the circle one afternoon when a lot of them sat on  deck smoking and reading aloud. People do not do such things so often  now, but when I was young we got rid of a great deal of time so. Well,  so it happened that in his turn Nolan took the book and read to the  others; and he read very well, as I know. Nobody in the circle knew a  line of the poem, only it was all magic and Border chivalry, and was ten  thousand years ago. Poor Nolan read steadily through the fifth canto,  stopped a minute and drank something, and then began, without a thought  of what was coming,--        \"Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,      Who never to himself hath said,\"--    It seems impossible to us that anybody ever heard this for the first  time; but all these fellows did then, and poor Nolan himself went on,  still unconsciously or mechanically,--        \"This is my own, my native land!\"    Then they all saw something was to pay; but he expected to get through,  I suppose, turned a little pale, but plunged on,--        \"Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,      As home his footsteps he hath turned        From wandering on a foreign strand?--      If such there breathe, go, mark him well,\"--    By this time the men were all beside themselves, wishing there was any  way to make him turn over two pages; but he had not quite presence of  mind for that; he gagged a little, colored crimson, and staggered on,--        \"For him no minstrel raptures swell;      High though his titles, proud his name,      Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,      Despite these titles, power, and pelf,      The wretch, concentred all in self,\"--    and here the poor fellow choked, could not go on, but started up, swung  the book into the sea, vanished into his state-room, \"And by Jove,\" said  Phillips, \"we did not see him for two months again. And I had to make up  some beggarly story to that English surgeon why I did not return his  Walter Scott to him.\"    That story shows about the time when Nolan's braggadocio must have  broken down. At first, they said, he took a very high tone, considered  his imprisonment a mere farce, affected to enjoy the voyage, and all  that; but Phillips said that after he came out of his state-room he  never was the same man again. He never read aloud again, unless it was  the Bible or Shakespeare, or something else he was sure of. But it was  not that merely. He never entered in with the other young men exactly as  a companion again. He was always shy afterwards, when I knew him,--very  seldom spoke, unless he was spoken to, except to a very few friends. He  lighted up occasionally,--I remember late in his life hearing him fairly  eloquent on something which had been suggested to him by one of  Flechier's sermons,--but generally he had the nervous, tired look of a  heart-wounded man.    When Captain Shaw was coming home,--if, as I say, it was Shaw,--rather  to the surprise of every body they made one of the Windward Islands,  and lay off and on for nearly a week. The boys said the officers were  sick of salt-junk, and meant to have turtle-soup before they came home.  But after several days the Warren came to the same rendezvous; they  exchanged signals; she sent to Phillips and these homeward-bound men  letters and papers, and told them she was outward-bound, perhaps to the  Mediterranean, and took poor Nolan and his traps on the boat back to try  his second cruise. He looked very blank when he was told to get ready to  join her. He had known enough of the signs of the sky to know that till  that moment he was going \"home.\" But this was a distinct evidence of  something he had not thought of, perhaps,--that there was no going home  for him, even to a prison. And this was the first of some twenty such  transfers, which brought him sooner or later into half our best vessels,  but which kept him all his life at least some hundred miles from the  country he had hoped he might never hear of again.    It may have been on that second cruise,--it was once when he was up the  Mediterranean,--that Mrs. Graff, the celebrated Southern beauty of those  days, danced with him. They had been lying a long time in the Bay of  Naples, and the officers were very intimate in the English fleet, and  there had been great festivities, and our men thought they must give a  great ball on board the ship. How they ever did it on board the \"Warren\"  I am sure I do not know. Perhaps it was not the \"Warren,\" or perhaps  ladies did not take up so much room as they do now. They wanted to use  Nolan's state-room for something, and they hated to do it without asking  him to the ball; so the captain said they might ask him, if they would  be responsible that he did not talk with the wrong people, \"who would  give him intelligence.\" So the dance went on, the finest party that had  ever been known, I dare say; for I never heard of a man-of-war ball that  was not. For ladies they had the family of the American consul, one or  two travellers who had adventured so far, and a nice bevy of English  girls and matrons, perhaps Lady Hamilton herself.    Well, different officers relieved each other in standing and talking  with Nolan in a friendly way, so as to be sure that nobody else spoke to  him. The dancing went on with spirit, and after a while even the fellows  who took this honorary guard of Nolan ceased to fear any _contretemps_.  Only when some English lady--Lady Hamilton, as I said, perhaps--called  for a set of \"American dances,\" an odd thing happened. Everybody then  danced contra-dances. The black band, nothing loath, conferred as to  what \"American dances\" were, and started off with a \"Virginia Reel,\"  which they followed with \"Money-Musk,\" which, in its turn in those days,  should have been followed by \"The Old Thirteen.\" But just as Dick, the  leader, tapped for his fiddles to begin, and bent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"with Mr Gilbert to look for fresh  water. We landed in the cove above-mentioned, and were received with great  courtesy by the natives. After I had distributed some presents amongst  them, I asked for water, and was conducted to a pond of it that was  brackish, about three-fourths of a mile from the landing-place, which I  supposed to be the same that Tasman watered at. In the mean time, the  people in the boat had laden her with fruit and roots, which the natives  had brought down, and exchanged for nails and beads. On our return to the  ship, I found the same sort of traffic carrying on there. After breakfast,  I went ashore with two boats to trade with the people, accompanied by  several of the gentlemen, and ordered the launch to follow with casks to be  filled with water. The natives assisted us to roll them to and from the  pond; and a nail or a bead was the expence of their labour. Fruits and  roots, especially shaddocks and yams, were brought down in such plenty,  that the two boats were laden, sent off, cleared, and laden a second time,  before noon; by which time also the launch had got a full supply of water,  and the botanical and shooting parties had all come in, except the surgeon,  for whom we could not wait, as the tide was ebbing fast out of the cove;  consequently he was left behind. As there is no getting into the cove with  a boat, from between half-ebb to half-flood, we could get off no water in  the afternoon. However, there is a very good landing-place, without it,  near the southern point, where boats can get ashore at all times of the  tide. Here some of the officers landed after dinner, where they found the  surgeon, who had been robbed of his gun. Having come down to the shore some  time after the boats had put off, he got a canoe to bring him on board;  but, as he was getting into her, a fellow snatched hold of the gun, and ran  off with it. After that no one would carry him to the ship, and they would  have stripped him, as he imagined, had he not presented a tooth-pick case,  which they, no doubt, thought was a little gun. As soon as I heard of this,  I landed at the place above-mentioned, and the few natives who were there  fled at my approach. After landing I went in search of the officers, whom I  found in the cove, where we had been in the morning, with a good many of  the natives about them. No step had been taken to recover the gun, nor did  I think proper to take any; but in this I was wrong. The easy manner of  obtaining this gun, which they now, no doubt, thought secure in their  possession, encouraged them to proceed in these tricks, as will soon  appear. The alarm the natives had caught being soon over, they carried  fruit, etc. to the boats, which got pretty well laden before night, when we  all returned on board.    Early in the morning of the 28th, Lieutenant Clerke, with the master and  fourteen or fifteen men, went on shore in the launch for water. I did  intend to have followed in another boat myself, but rather unluckily  deferred it till after breakfast. The launch was no sooner landed than the  natives gathered about her, behaving in so rude a manner, that the officers  were in some doubt if they should land their casks; but, as they expected  me on shore soon, they ventured, and with difficulty got them filled, and  into the boat again. In the doing of this Mr Clerke's gun was snatched from  him, and carried off; as were also some of the cooper's tools; and several  of the people were stripped of one thing or another. All this was done, as  it were, by stealth; for they laid hold of nothing by main force. I landed  just as the launch was ready to put off; and the natives, who were pretty  numerous on the beach, as soon as they saw me, fled; so that I suspected  something had happened. However, I prevailed on many to stay, and Mr Clerke  came, and informed me of all the preceding circumstances. I quickly came to  a resolution to oblige them to make restitution; and, for this purpose,  ordered all the marines to be armed and sent on shore. Mr Forster and his  party being gone into the country, I ordered two or three guns to be fired  from the ship, in order to alarm him; not knowing how the natives might act  on this occasion. These orders being given, I sent all the boats off but  one, with which I staid, having a good many of the natives about me, who  behaved with their usual courtesy. I made them so sensible of my intention,  that long before the marines came, Mr Clerke's musket was brought; but they  used many excuses to divert me from insisting on the other. At length Mr  Edgcumbe arriving with the marines, this alarmed them so much, that some  fled. The first step I took was to seize on two large double sailing  canoes, which were in the cove. One fellow making resistance, I fired some  small shot at him, and sent him limping off. The natives being now  convinced that I was in earnest, all fled; but on my calling to them, many  returned; and, presently after, the other musket was brought, and laid down  at my feet. That moment, I ordered the canoes to be restored, to shew them  on what account they were detained. The other things we had lost being of  less value, I was the more indifferent about them. By this time the launch  was ashore for another turn of water, and we were permitted to fill the  casks without any one daring to come near us; except one man, who had  befriended us during the whole affair, and seemed to disapprove of the  conduct of his countrymen.    On my returning from the pond to the cove, I found a good many people  collected together, from whom we understood that the man I had fired at was  dead. This story I treated as improbable, and addressed a man, who seemed  of some consequence, for the restitution of a cooper's adze we had lost in  the morning. He immediately sent away two men, as I thought, for it; but I  soon found that we had greatly mistaken each other; for instead of the  adze, they brought the wounded man, stretched out on a board, and laid him  down by me, to all appearance dead. I was much moved at the sight; but soon  saw my mistake, and that he was only wounded in the hand and thigh. I,  therefore, desired he might be carried out of the sun, and sent for the  surgeon to dress his wounds. In the mean time, I addressed several people  for the adze; for as I had now nothing else to do, I determined to have it.  The one I applied the most to, was an elderly woman, who had always a great  deal to say to me, from my first landing; but, on this occasion, she gave  her tongue full scope. I understood but little of her eloquence; and all I  could gather from her arguments was, that it was mean in me to insist on  the return of so trifling a thing. But when she found I was determined, she  and three or four more women went away; and soon after the adze was brought  me, but I saw her no more. This I was sorry for, as I wanted to make her a  present, in return for the part she had taken in all our transactions,  private as well as public. For I was no sooner returned from the pond, the  first time I landed, than this old lady presented to me a girl, giving me  to understand she was at my service. Miss, who probably had received her  instructions, wanted, as a preliminary article, a spike-nail or a shirt,  neither of which I had to give her, and soon made them sensible of my  poverty. I thought, by that means, to have come off with flying colours;  but I was mistaken; for they gave me to understand I might retire with her  on credit. On my declining this proposal, the old lady began to argue with  me; and then abuse me. Though I comprehended little of what she said, her  actions were expressive enough, and shewed that her words were to this  effect, sneering in my face, saying, What sort of a man are you, thus to  refuse the embraces of so fine a young woman? For the girl certainly did  not want beauty; which, however, I could better withstand, than the abuses  of this worthy matron, and therefore hastened into the boat. They wanted me  to take the young lady aboard; but this could not be done, as I had given  strict orders, before I went ashore, to suffer no woman, on any pretence  whatever, to come into the ship, for reasons which I shall mention in  another place.    As soon as the surgeon got ashore, he dressed the man's wounds, and bled  him; and was of opinion that he was in no sort of danger, as the shot had  done little more than penetrate the skin. In the operation, some poultice  being wanting, the surgeon asked for ripe plantains; but they brought  sugar-cane, and having chewed it to a pulp, gave it him to apply to the  wound. This being of a more balsamic nature than the other; proves that  these people have some knowledge of simples. As soon as the man's wounds  were dressed, I made him a present, which his master, or at least the man  who owned the canoe, took, most probably to himself. Matters being thus  settled apparently to the satisfaction of all parties, we repaired on board  to dinner, where I found a good supply of fruit and roots, and, therefore,  gave orders to get every thing in readiness to sail.    I now was informed of a circumstance which was observed on board; several  canoes being at the ship, when the great guns were fired in the morning,  they all retired, but one man, who was bailing the water out of his canoe,  which lay alongside directly under the guns. When the first was fired, he  just looked up, and then, quite unconcerned, continued his work. Nor had  the second gun any other effect upon him. He did not stir till the water  was all out of his canoe, when he paddled leisurely off. This man had,  several times, been observed to take fruit and roots out of other canoes,  and sell them to us. If the owners did not willingly part with them, he  took them by force; by which he obtained the appellation of custom-house  officer. One time, after he had been collecting tribute, he happened"]]]
