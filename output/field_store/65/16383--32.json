See also above,  p. 13, n. 2.]    [Footnote 3: He was the imperial Russian Commissary in Warsaw, and was  practically in control of the affairs in Poland. See below, p. 92 et  seq.]    Novosiltzev was evidently well informed about the state of mind of the  Jewish masses. No sooner had the rumor of the proposed ukase reached the  Pale of Settlement than the Jews were seized by a tremendous excitement.  It must be borne in mind that the Jewish population of Western Russia  had but recently been incorporated into the Russian Empire. Clinging  with patriarchal devotion to their religion, estranged from the Russian  people, and kept, moreover, in a state of civil rightlessness, the Jews  of that region could not be reasonably expected to gloat over the  prospect of a military service of twenty-five years' duration, which was  bound to alienate their sons from their ancestral faith, detach them  from their native tongue, their habits and customs of life, and throw  them into a strange, and often hostile, environment. The ultimate aim of  the project, which, imbedded in the mind of its originators, seemed  safely hidden from the eye of publicity, was quickly sensed by the  delicate national instinct, and the soul of the people was stirred to  its depths. Public-minded Jews strained every nerve to avert the  calamity. Jewish representatives journeyed to St. Petersburg and Warsaw  to plead the cause of their brethren. Negotiations were entered into  with dignitaries of high rank and with men of influence in the world of  officialdom. Rumor had it that immense bribes had been offered to  Novosiltzev and several high officials in St. Petersburg for the purpose  of receiving their co-operation. But even the intercession of leading  dignitaries was powerless to change the will of the Tzar. He chafed  under the red-tape formalities which obstructed the realization of his  favorite scheme. Without waiting for the transmission of Novosiltzev's  memorandum, the Tzar directed the Minister of the Interior and the Chief  of the General Staff to submit to him for signature an ukase imposing  military service upon the Jews. The fatal enactment was signed on August  26, 1827.      2. The Recruiting Ukase of 1827 and Juvenile Conscription    The ukase announces the desire of the Government \"to equalize military  duty for all estates,\" without, be it noted, equalizing them in their  rights. It further expresses the conviction that \"the training and  accomplishments, acquired by the Jews during their military service,  will, on their return home after the completion of the number of years  fixed by law (fully a quarter of a century!), be communicated to their  families and make for greater usefulness and higher efficiency in their  economic life and in the management of their affairs.\"    However, the \"Statute of Conscription and Military Service,\" subjoined  to the ukase, was a lurid illustration of a tendency utterly at variance  with the desire \"to equalize military duty.\" Had the Russian Government  been genuinely desirous of rendering military duty uniform for all  estates, there would have been no need of issuing separately for the  Jews a huge enactment of ninety-five clauses, with supplementary  \"instructions,\" consisting of sixty-two clauses, for the guidance of the  civil and military authorities. All that was necessary was to declare  that the general military statute applied also to the Jews. Instead, the  reverse stipulation is made: \"The general laws and institutions are not  valid in the case of the Jews\" when at variance with the special statute  (Clause 3).    The discriminating character of Jewish conscription looms particularly  large in the central portion of the statute. Jewish families were  stricken with terror on reading the eighth clause of the statute  prescribing that \"the Jewish conscripts presented by the [Jewish]  communes shall be between the ages of twelve and twenty-five.\" This  provision was supplemented by Clause 74: \"Jewish minors, i.e., below the  age of eighteen, shall be placed in preparatory establishments for  military training.\"    True, the institution of minor recruits, called _cantonists_, [1] existed  also for Christians. But in their case it was confined to the children  of soldiers in active service, by virtue of the principle laid down by  Arakcheyev [2] that children born of soldiers were the property of the  Military Department, whereas the conscription of Jewish minors was to be  absolute and to apply to all Jewish families without discrimination. To  make things worse, the law demanded that the years of preparatory  training should not be included in the term of active service, the  latter to start only with the age of eighteen (Clause 90); in other  words, the Jewish cantonists were compelled to serve an additional term  of six years over and above the obligatory twenty-five years. Moreover,  at the examination of Jewish conscripts, all that was demanded for their  enlistment was \"that they be free from any disease or defect  incompatible with military service, but the other qualifications  required by the general rules shall be left out of consideration\"  (Clause 10).    [Footnote 1: From _Canton_, a word applied in Prussia in the eighteenth  century to a recruiting district. In Russia, beginning with 1805, the term  \"cantonists\" is applied to children born of soldiers and therefore liable  to conscription.]    [Footnote 2: See Vol. I, p. 395, n. 1.]    The duty of enlisting the recruits was imposed upon the Jewish communes,  or Kahals, which were to elect for that purpose between three and six  executive officers, or \"trustees,\" in every city. The community as such  was held responsible for the supply of a given number of recruits from  its own midst. It was authorized to draft into military service any Jew  guilty \"of irregularity in the payment of taxes, of vagrancy, and other  misdemeanors.\" In case the required number of recruits was not  forthcoming within a given term, the authorities were empowered to  obtain them from the derelict community \"by way of execution.\" [1] Any  irregularity on the part of the recruiting \"trustees\" was to be punished  by the imposition of fines or even by sending them into the army.    [Footnote 1: The term \"execution\" (_ekzekutzia_) is used in Russian to  designate a writ empowering an officer to carry a judgment into effect,  in other words, to resort to forcible seizure.]    The following categories of Jews were exempted from military duty:  merchants holding membership in guilds, artisans affiliated with  trade-unions, mechanics in factories, agricultural colonists, rabbis,  and the Jews, few and far between at that time, who had graduated from a  Russian educational institution. Those exempted from military service in  kind were required to pay \"recruiting money,\" one thousand rubles for  each recruit. The general law providing that a regular recruit could  offer as his substitute a \"volunteer\" was extended to the Jews, with the  proviso that the volunteer must also be a Jew.    The \"Instructions\" to the civil authorities, appended to the statute,  specify the formalities to be followed both at the recruiting stations  and in administering the oath of allegiance to the conscripts in the  synagogues. The latter ceremony was to be marked by gloomy solemnity.  The recruit was to be arrayed in his prayer-shawl (Tallith) and shroud  (Kittel). With his philacteries wound around his arm, he should be  placed before the Ark and, amidst burning candles and to the  accompaniment of shofar blasts, made to recite a lengthy awe-inspiring  oath. The \"Instructions\" to the military authorities accompanying the  statute prescribe that every batch of Jewish conscripts \"shall be  entrusted to a special officer to be watched over, prior to their  departure for their places of destination, and shall be kept apart from  the other recruits.\" Both in the places of conscription and on the  journey the Jewish recruits were to be quartered exclusively in the  homes of Christian residents.    The promulgated \"military constitution\" surpassed the very worst  apprehension of the Jews. All were staggered by this sudden blow, which  descended crushingly upon the mode of life, the time-honored traditions,  and the religious ideals of the Jewish people. The Jewish family nests  became astir, trembling for their fledglings. Barely a month after the  publication of the military statute, the central Government in St.  Petersburg was startled by the report that the Volhynian town of  Old-Constantine had been the scene of \"mutiny and disorders among the  Jews\" on the occasion of the promulgation of the ukase. Benckendorff,  the Chief of the Gendarmerie, [1] conveyed this information to the Tzar,  who thereupon gave orders that \"in all similar cases the culprits be  court-martialed\". Evidently, the St. Petersburg authorities apprehended a  whole series of Jewish mutinies, as a result of the dreadful ukase, and  they were ready with extraordinary measures for the emergency.    [Footnote 1: Since 1827 the Gendarmerie served as the executive organ of  the political police, or of the so-called Third Section, dreaded  throughout Russia on account of its relentless cruelty in suppressing  the slightest manifestation of liberal thought. The Third Section was  nominally abolished in 1880.]    However, their apprehensions were unfounded. Apart from the incident  referred to, there were no cases of open rebellion against the  authorities. As a matter of fact, even in Old-Constantine, the \"mutiny\"  was of a nature little calculated to be dealt with by a court-martial.  According to the local tradition, the Jewish residents, Hasidim almost  to a man, were so profoundly stirred by the imperial ukase that they  assembled in the synagogues, fasting and praying, and finally resolved  to adopt \"energetic\" measures.

What did you do in the storm, Ned?\"    \"I found shelter in a thick grove, managed to light a fire, and slept  there in my blankets.\"    \"We did about the same.\"    \"But I saw something before I reached my shelter.\"    \"What was that?\" exclaimed the two, noting the significance in Ned's  tone.    \"While I was waiting in a dip I saw ten Mexican horsemen ride by. They  were heavily armed, and I've no doubt they were scouts belonging to some  strong force.\"    \"And so they are back on this side of the Rio Grande,\" said Obed White  thoughtfully. \"I'm not surprised. Our Texans have rejoiced too early.  The full storm has not burst yet.\"    The Panther began to bristle. A giant in size, he seemed to grow larger,  and his gorgeous hunting suit strained at the seams.    \"Let 'em come on,\" he said menacingly. \"Let Santa Anna himself lead 'em.  We Texans can take care of 'em all.\"    But Obed White shook his head sadly.    \"We could if we were united,\" he said, \"but our leaders have taken to  squabbling. You're a Cheerful Talker, Panther, and you deserve both your  names, but to tell you the honest truth I'm afraid of the Mexican  advance.\"    \"I think the Mexicans probably belonged to Urrea's band,\" said Ned.    \"Very likely,\" said Obed. \"He's about the most energetic of their  partisan leaders, and it may be that we'll run against him pretty soon.\"    They had heard in their scouting along the Rio Grande that young  Francisco Urrea, after the discovery that he was a spy and his  withdrawal from San Antonio with the captured army of Cos, had organized  a strong force of horsemen and was foremost among those who were urging  a new Mexican advance into Texas.    \"It's pretty far west for the Mexicans,\" said the Panther. \"We're on the  edge of the Indian country here.\"    But Obed considered it all the more likely that Urrea, if he meditated a  raid, would come from the west, since his approach at that point would  be suspected the least. The three held a brief discussion and soon came  to an agreement. They would continue their own ride west and look for  Urrea. Having decided so, they went into the task heart and soul,  despite its dangers.    The three rode side by side and three pairs of skilled eyes examined the  plain. The snow was left only in sheltered places or among the trees.  But the further they went the scarcer became the trees, and before night  they disappeared entirely.    \"We are comin' upon the buffalo range,\" said the Panther. \"A hundred  miles further west we'd be likely to strike big herds. When we're  through fightin' the Mexicans I'm goin' out there again. It's the life  fur me.\"    The night came, dark and cold, but fortunately without wind. They camped  in a dip and did not light any fire, lying as Ned had done the night  before on their horse blankets and wrapping themselves in their own. The  three horses seemed to be contented with one another and made no noise.    They deemed it wise now to keep a watch, as they might be near Urrea's  band or Lipans might pass, and the Panther, who said he was not sleepy  at all, became sentinel. Ned, although he had not risen until noon, was  sleepy again from the long ride, and his eyes closed soon. The last  object that he saw was the Panther standing on the crest of the swell  just beyond them, rifle on shoulder, watching the moonlit plains. Obed  White was asleep already.    The Panther walked back and forth a few times and then looked down at  his comrades in the dip. His trained eyes saw their chests rising and  falling, and he knew that they were far away in the land of Nowhere.  Then he extended his walk back and forth a little further, scanning  carefully the dusky plain.    A light wind sprang up after a while, and it brought a low but heavy and  measured tread to his ears. The Panther's first impulse was to awaken  his friends, because this might be the band of Urrea, but he hesitated a  moment, and then lay down with his ear to the earth. When he rose his  uneasiness had departed and he resumed his walk back and forth. He had  heard that tread before many times and, now that it was coming nearer,  he could not mistake it, but, as the measured beat indicated that it  would pass to one side, it bore no threat for his comrades or himself.    The Panther did not stop his walk as from a distance of a few hundred  yards he watched the great buffalo herd go by. The sound was so steady  and regular that Ned and Obed were not awakened nor were the horses  disturbed. The buffaloes showed a great black mass across the plain,  extending for fully a mile, and they were moving north at an even gait.  The Panther watched until the last had passed, and he judged that there  were fully a hundred thousand animals in the herd. He saw also the big  timber wolves hanging on the rear and flanks, ready to cut out stray  calves or those weak from old age. So busy were the wolves seeking a  chance that they did not notice the gigantic figure of the man, rifle on  shoulder, who stood on the crest of the swell looking at them as they  passed.    The Panther's eyes followed the black line of the herd until it  disappeared under the northern rim of darkness. He was wondering why the  buffaloes were traveling so steadily after daylight and he came to the  conclusion that the impelling motive was not a search for new pastures.  He listened a long time until the last rumble of the hundred thousand  died away in a faint echo, and then he awakened his comrades.    \"I'm thinkin',\" he said, \"that the presence of Urrea's band made the  buffaloes move. Now I'm not a Ring Tailed Panther an' a Cheerful Talker  for nothin', an' we want to hunt that band. Like as not they've been  doin' some mischief, which we may be able partly to undo. I'm in favor  of ridin' south, back on the herd track an' lookin' for 'em.\"    \"So am I,\" said Obed White. \"My watch says it's one o'clock in the  morning, and my watch is always right, because I made it myself. We've  had a pretty good rest, enough to go on, and what we find may be worth  finding. A needle in a haystack may be well hid, but you'll find it if  you look long enough.\"    They rode almost due south in the great path made by the buffalo herd,  not stopping for a full two hours when a halt was made at a signal from  the Panther. They were in a wide plain, where buffalo grass yet grew  despite the winter, and the Panther said with authority that the herd  had been grazing here before it was started on its night journey into  the north.    \"An' if we ride about this place long enough,\" he said, \"we'll find the  reason why the buffaloes left it.\"    He turned his horse in a circuit of the plain and Ned and Obed followed  the matchless tracker, who was able, even in the moonlight, to note any  disturbance of the soil. Presently he uttered a little cry and pointed  ahead. Both saw the skeleton of a buffalo which evidently had been  killed not long and stripped of its meat. A little further on they saw  another and then two more.    \"That tells it,\" said the Panther succinctly. \"These buffaloes were  killed for food an' most likely by Mexicans. It was the shots that set  the herd to runnin'. The men who killed 'em are not far away, an' I'm  not a Ring Tailed Panther an' a Cheerful Talker if they don't belong to  Urrea's band.\"    \"Isn't that a light?\" said Ned, pointing to the west, \"or is it a  firefly or something of the kind?\"    A glowing spark was just visible over the plain, but as it neither moved  nor went out the three concluded that it was made by a distant fire.    \"I think it's in chaparral or among trees,\" said Obed, \"or we would see  it more plainly. It's a poor camp fire that hides its light under a  bushel.\"    \"I think you're right an' it must be chaparral,\" said the Panther. \"But  we'll ride toward it an' soon answer our own questions.\"    The light was more than a mile away and, as they advanced slowly, they  saw it grow in size and intensity. It was surely a campfire, but no  sound that they could yet hear came from it. They did not expect to hear  any. If it was indeed Urrea and his men they would probably be sleeping  soundly, not expecting any foe to be near. The Panther now dismounted,  and the other two did likewise.    \"No need to show too high above the plain,\" he said, \"an' if we have to  run it won't take a second to jump back on our horses.\"    Ned did not take the bridle of his horse as the others did. He knew that  Old Jack would follow as faithful as any dog to his master, and he was  right. As they advanced slowly the velvet nose more than once pressed  trustfully against his elbow.    They saw now that an extensive growth of chaparral rose before them,  from the center of which the light seemed to be shining. The Panther lay  down on the prairie, put his ear to the ground, and listened a long  time.    \"I think I hear the feet of horses movin' now an' then,\" he said, \"an'  if so, one of us had better stay behin' with ours. A horse of theirs  might neigh an' a horse of ours might answer. Yon can't tell. Obed, I  guess it'll be for you to stay. You've got a most soothin' disposition  with animals.\"    \"All right,\" said Obed philosophically, \"I'd rather go on, but, if it's  better for me to stay, I'll stay. They also serve who stand and hold the  reins. If you find you've got to leave in a hurry I'll be here waiting.\"    He gathered up the reins of the three horses and remained quietly on the  plain, while Ned and the Panther went forward, making straight for the  light.    When they came to the edge of the chaparral they knelt among the bushes  and listened. Now both distinctly heard the occasional movement of  horses, and they saw the dusky outlines of several figures before the  fire, which was about three hundred yards away.    \"They are bound to be Mexicans,\" whispered the Panther, \"'cause there  are no Texans in this part of the country, an' you an' me, Ned, must  find out just who"]]]
