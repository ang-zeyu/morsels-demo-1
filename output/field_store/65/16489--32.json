Notice, there is  a portion of the length of each string between the bridge and the  hitchpin.        [B] There are two sections of the lower bridge, one for the treble      and one for the overstrung bass.    [Illustration]    At the upper end of the strings, a \"bearing-bar,\" situated between the  tuning pins and upper bridge, is attached to the pin-block by screws  which draw it inward; its function is to hold the strings firmly in  position. You will notice that the lengths of the strings, above the  bearing-bar, vary considerably, even in the three strings comprising  the unison. (We will speak of the effect of this in tuning, farther  on.)    After that portion of the case is completed which forms the key-bed or  action frame, we are ready to set in the      ACTION.    By this is meant the keys and all those intricate parts which convey  the motion of the key to the hammers which strike the strings, and the  dampers which mute them.    The requisites of the action are as follows:    The keys must descend quickly and easily at the touch of the  performer, giving quick response.    The weight of the hammer must be properly proportioned to the strings  it causes to vibrate.    The hammer must rebound after striking the string. (Where the hammer  remains against the string, thereby preventing vibration, the term  \"blocking\" is used to designate the fault.)    The action must be capable of quick repetition; that is, when a key is  struck a number of times in quick succession, it must respond  perfectly every time.    After striking and rebounding from the string, the hammer should not  fall to its lowest position where it rests when not in use, as this  would prevent quick repetition. For catching the hammer at a short  distance from the string, a felted piece of wood suspended on a wire,  called the back check, rises when the key is depressed, and returns  when the key is released, allowing the hammer to regain its resting  position.    A damper, for stopping the tone of the string when a key is released,  must leave the string just before the hammer strikes, and return the  instant the key is released.    A means must be provided for releasing all the dampers from the  strings at the will of the performer. The loud pedal, as it is  called, but more properly, the damper pedal, accomplishes this end by  raising the dampers from the strings.    In the square and the grand piano, the action is under the  sound-board, while the strings are over it; so the hammers are made to  strike through an opening in the sound-board. In the upright, the  strings are between the action and the sound-board; so no opening is  necessary in the latter.    The \"trap-action\" consists of the pedals and the parts which convey  motion to the action proper.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON II.        1. What have been some of the salient obstacles necessary to      overcome in producing the perfected piano?        2. Of what use are the dampers? Explain their mechanical action.        3. Mention several of the qualities necessary to a good action.        4. Describe the building of an upright piano.        5. Contrast the musical capacity and peculiar characteristics of      the piano with those of the organ, which has the same keyboard.          LESSON III.    ~TECHNICAL NAMES AND USES OF THE PARTS OF THE UPRIGHT PIANO ACTION.~      In the practice of piano tuning, the first thing is to ascertain if  the action is in first-class condition. The tuner must be able to  detect, locate and correct the slightest defect in any portion of the  instrument. Any regulating or repairing of the action should be  attended to before tuning the instrument; the latter should be the  final operation. As a thorough knowledge of regulating and repairing  is practically indispensable to the professional tuner, the author has  spared neither means, labor nor research to make this part of the  lessons very complete, and feels sure that it will meet with the  hearty approval of most, if not all, students. The piano tuner who  knows nothing of regulating and repairing will miss many an  opportunity to earn extra money.    The illustration accompanying this lesson is from a Wessell, Nickel  and Gross Upright action. This firm, whose product is considered the  acme of perfection, makes nothing but actions. Most manufacturers of  pianos, of the present day, build the wooden frame, the sound-board  and the case only; the action, metal plate, strings, tuning-pins,  etc., being purchased from different firms who make a specialty of the  manufacture of these parts. A few concerns, however, make every piece  that enters into the composition of the instruments bearing their  names.    [Illustration]    _Ky_, is the Key in its resting position.    _c_, wherever found, represents a cushion of felt or soft leather upon  which the different parts of the action rest or come in contact with  each other. Their purpose, as is readily seen, is that of rendering  the action noiseless and easy of operation.    _Bnc R_, shows the end of the balance rail, extending the entire  length of the keyboard.    _B P_, is the balance pin. This is a perfectly round pin driven firmly  in the balance rail. The bottom of the hole in the key fits closely  around the balance pin; at the top, it is the shape of a mortise,  parallel with the key, which allows the key to move only in the  direction intended. The mortise in the wooden cap on top of the key at  this point is lined with bushing cloth which holds the key in position  laterally, and prevents looseness and rattling, yet allows the key to  move easily.    _L_, is the lead put in this portion of the key to balance it, and to  insure uniformity of \"touch,\" and quick and certain return of key to  its rest position. As there is more or less difference in the length  of keys, and also in the weight of the hammers operated by them, some  keys are leaded much more heavily than others. In some cases the lead  is inserted in the extreme back end of the key; in others it is put  near the balance rail according to the requirement. In some actions  the lead is omitted entirely; but in the best actions it is almost  invariably present. In the action of the grand piano the keys are  leaded in front of the balance rail instead of back of it. This is due  to the fact that in the grand piano the hammer rests in a horizontal  position and its whole weight must be actually lifted and the force of  gravity overcome, while in the upright, the hammer rests in a  vertical position, only requiring to be thrown forward.    _G P_, is the guide pin, generally of oval shape, with the longest  diameter in line with the key. The hole in the lower portion of the  key, in which the guide pin works, is bushed with bushing cloth and is  made to fit so closely that the key will not move laterally, yet not  so tightly that the key will not work easily.    _Bm_, is a wooden block called the bottom; sometimes called the  key-rocker. It is held in position by the two screws shown in cut by  which it can be adjusted or regulated.    _E_, is the extension communicating the motion of the key to the upper  part of the action. There are various ways in which the extension is  connected to the bottom. In this action, the extension is made round  at the lower end and fits snugly into a hole in the bottom upon a felt  disc. When the action is taken out, the extensions simply lift out of  the holes, and when it is put back it is necessary to enter each one  in its place. In other actions, the upper side of the bottom where  the extension rests has no hole but simply a felt covering upon which  the extension rests; in this case it is necessary to provide what is  called an extension guide which is hinged to the extension guide rail  shown in the cut at the left of the extension. In actions of this  kind, the extensions remain in place at all times and the trouble of  placing them properly on the bottom when replacing the action is  obviated. Other methods also are employed which are readily understood  upon slight examination, but are essentially similar to the above.  Instead of the bottom, a capstan screw is used in some actions as  follows:    _Cpn_, is a capstan screw used in some actions in place of the bottom.  It is turned by inserting a pointed instrument in one of the four  holes, thus raising or lowering the capstan in regulating. The lower  end of the extension is felted. In such actions the extension is  invariably provided with the extension guide.    _B_, is the metal action bracket. The bracket is one solid piece of  metal. There are generally four brackets in the upright action. The  brackets rest on supports in and at the sides of the keybed, and are  secured at the top by large bolts,    _BB_, which go through the metal plate and into the wooden frame or  pin block. At the top of each bracket is an opening to receive this  bolt and a thumbscrew (not shown in the cut, being behind the hammer)  which fastens the action securely in position.    _M R_, is the main rail; so called because the main constituents of  the action are attached to it. (Everything designated as \"rail\" in the  action runs the entire length of the action in one solid piece.)    _W_, is the wippen. Those pieces upon which or by which the small  letter _g_ is shown are the flanges. The one at the left of the wippen  is called the wippen flange. It is made fast to the main rail by a  screw, and upon it the wippen is hinged by means of a \"center-pin\" at  the lower end. The center-pin in the wippen is driven through a hole  in which it fits tightly and immovably in the middle part, and it (the  center-pin) is consequently stationary in the wippen. The flange  extends down at the sides of the wippen and the holes in flange are  made large enough to receive bushing cloth in which the center-pin  works freely but not loosely. All flange joints are of this nature;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#3)"],[1,", and collars      2       \"            Half a shelter-tent, and ropes                2       \"            Toilet articles, stationery, and small wares  2       \"            Food for one day                              3       \"                                                          ----                  Total                                   20 pounds.    You may be able to reduce the weight here given by taking a lighter  blanket, and no knapsack or canteen; but most likely the food that you  actually put in your haversack will weigh more than three pounds. You  must also carry your share of the following things:--              Frying-pan, coffee-pot, and pail        3 pounds.            Hatchet, sheath-knife, case, and belt   3   \"            Company property named on last page     3   \"    Then if you carry a heavier kind of tent than the \"shelter,\" or carry  tent-poles, you must add still more. Allow also nearly three pounds a  day per man for food, if you carry more than enough for one day; and  remember, that when tents, blankets, and clothes get wet, it adds about  a quarter to their weight.    You see, therefore, that you have the prospect of hard work. I do not  wish to discourage you from going in this way: on the contrary, there is  a great deal of pleasure to be had by doing so. But the majority of men  under twenty years of age will find no pleasure in carrying so much  weight more than ten miles a day; and if a party of them succeed in  doing so, and in attending to all of the necessary work, without being  worse for it, they will be fortunate.    In conclusion, then, if you walk, and carry all your stuff, camping, and  doing all your work, and cooking as you go, you should travel but few  miles a day, or, better still, should have many days when you do not  move your camp at all.      OTHER WAYS OF GOING AFOOT.    It is not necessary to say much about the other ways of going afoot. If  you can safely dispense with cooking and carrying food, much will be  gained for travel and observation. The expenses, however, will be  largely increased. If you can also dispense with camping, you ought then  to be able to walk fifteen or twenty miles daily, and do a good deal of  sight-seeing besides. You should be in practice, however, to do this.    You must know beforehand about your route, and whether the country is  settled where you are going.    Keep in mind, when you are making plans, that it is easier for one or  two to get accommodation at the farmhouses than for a larger party.    I heard once of two fellows, who, to avoid buying and carrying a tent,  slept on hay-mows, usually without permission. It looks to me as if  those young men were candidates for the penitentiary. If you cannot  travel honorably, and without begging, I should advise you to stay at  home.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] A German officer tells me that his comrades in the Franco-Prussian  war of 1870-1 had no rubber blankets; nor had they any shelter-tents  such as our Union soldiers used in 1861-5 as a make-shift when their  rubbers were lost. But this is nothing to you: German discipline  compelled the soldiers to carry a big cloak which sheds water quite  well, and is useful to a soldier for other purposes: but the weight and  bulk condemn it for pleasure-seekers.    [3] In general it is better to put the shelter-tent in the roll, and to  keep out the rubber blanket, for you may need the last before you camp.  You can roll the rubber blanket tightly around the other roll (the cloth  side out, as the rubber side is too slippery), and thus be able to take  it off readily without disturbing the other things. You can also roll  the rubber blanket separately, and link it to the large roll after the  manner of two links of a chain.    [4] I knew an officer in the army, who carried a rubber air-pillow  through thick and thin, esteeming it, after his life and his rations,  the greatest necessity of his existence. Another officer, when  transportation was cut down, held to his camp-chair. Almost every one  has his whim.          CHAPTER III.    LARGE PARTY TRAVELLING AFOOT WITH BAGGAGE-WAGON.      With a horse and wagon to haul your baggage you can of course carry  more. First of all take another blanket or two, a light overcoat, more  spare clothing, an axe, and try to have a larger tent than the  \"shelter.\"    If the body of the wagon has high sides, it will not be a very difficult  task to make a cloth cover that will shed water, and you will then have  what is almost as good as a tent: you can also put things under the  wagon. You must have a cover of some sort for your wagon-load while on  the march, to prevent injury from showers that overtake you, and to keep  out dust and mud. A tent-fly will answer for this purpose.    You want also to carry a few carriage-bolts, some nails, tacks, straps,  a hand-saw, and axle-wrench or monkey-wrench. I have always found use  for a sail-needle and twine; and I carry them now, even when I go for a  few days, and carry all on my person.    The first drawback that appears, when you begin to plan for a horse and  wagon, is the expense. You can overcome this in part by adding members  to your company; but then you meet what is perhaps a still more serious  difficulty,--the management of a large party.    Another inconvenience of large numbers is that each member must limit  his baggage. You are apt to accumulate too great bulk for the wagon,  rather than too great weight for the horse.    Where there are many there must be a captain,--some one that the others  are responsible to, and who commands their respect. It is necessary that  those who join such a party should understand that they ought to yield  to him, whether they like it or not.    The captain should always consult the wishes of the others, and should  never let selfish considerations influence him. Every day his decisions  as to what the party shall do will tend to make some one dissatisfied;  and although it is the duty of the dissatisfied ones to yield, yet,  since submission to another's will is so hard, the captain must try to  prevent any \"feeling,\" and above all to avoid even the appearance of  tyranny.    System and order become quite essential as our numbers increase, and it  is well to have the members take daily turns at the several duties; and  during that day the captain must hold each man to a strict performance  of his special trust, and allow no shirking.    After a few days some of the party will show a willingness to accept  particular burdens all of the time; and, if these burdens are the more  disagreeable ones, the captain will do well to make the detail  permanent.    Nothing tends to make ill feeling more than having to do another's work;  and, where there are many in a party, each one is apt to leave something  for others to do. The captain must be on the watch for these things, and  try to prevent them. It is well for him, and for all, to know that he  who has been a \"good fellow\" and genial companion at home may prove  quite otherwise during a tour of camping. Besides this, it is hardly  possible for a dozen young men to be gone a fortnight on a trip of this  kind without some quarrelling; and, as this mars the sport so much, all  should be careful not to give or take offence. If you are starting out  on your first tour, keep this fact constantly in mind.    Perhaps I can illustrate this division of labor.    We will suppose a party of twelve with one horse and an open wagon, four  tents, a stove, and other baggage. First, number the party, and assign  to each the duties for the first day.              1. Captain. Care of horse and wagon; loading and unloading wagon.            2. Jack. Loading and unloading wagon.            3. Joe. Captain's assistant and errand-boy; currying horse.            4. Mr. Smith. Cooking and purchasing.            5. Sam. Wood, water, fire, setting of table.            6. Tom.  \"     \"       \"       \"       \"            7. Mr. Jones.            8. Henry.            9. Bob.            10. Senior.            11. William.            12. Jake.    The party is thus arranged in four squads of three men each, the oldest  at the heads. One half of the party is actively engaged for to-day,  while the other half has little to do of a general nature, except that  all must take turns in leading the horse, and marching behind the wagon.  It is essential that this be done, and it is best that only the stronger  members lead the horse.    To-morrow No. 7 takes No. 1's place, No. 8 takes No. 2's, and so on; and  the first six have their semi-holiday.    In a few days each man will have shown a special willingness for  some duty, which by common consent and the captain's approval he is  permitted to take. The party then is re-organized as follows:--              1. Captain. General oversight; provider of food and provender.            2. Jack. Washing and the care of dishes.            3. Joe. (Worthless.)            4. Mr. Smith. Getting breakfast daily, and doing all of the                    cooking on Sunday.            5. Sam. (Gone home, sick of camping.)            6. Tom. Wood, water, fire, setting and clearing table.            7. Mr. Jones. Getting supper all alone.            8. Henry. Jack's partner. Care of food.            9. Bob. Currying horse, oiling axles, care of harness and wagon.            10. Senior. Packing wagon. Marching behind.            11. William.  \"      \"        \"       \"            12. Jake. Running errands.    The daily detail for leading the horse will have to be made, as before,  from the stronger members of the party; and if any special duty arises  it must still be done by volunteering, or by the captain's suggestion.    In this arrangement there is nothing to prevent one member from aiding  another; in fact, where all are employed, a better feeling prevails,  and, the work being done more quickly, there is more time for rest and  enjoyment.
