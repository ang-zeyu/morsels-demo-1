While two brigades of the Meerut Division were establishing themselves  on a new line the Dehra Dun Brigade, supported by the Jullunder Brigade  of the Lahore Division, moved to the attack of the Bois du Biez, but  were held up on the line of the River Les Layes by a German post at the  bridge, which enfiladed them and brought them to a standstill.    The defended bridge over the Les Layes and its neighborhood immediately  assumed considerable importance. While the artillery fire was brought to  bear, as far as circumstances would permit, on this point, General Sir  Douglas Haig directed the First Corps to dispatch one or more battalions  of the First Brigade in support of the troops attacking the bridge.  Three battalions were thus sent to Richebourg St. Vaast.    Darkness coming on and the enemy having brought up reinforcements, no  further progress could be made, and the Indian Corps and the Fourth  Corps proceeded to consolidate the position they had gained.    While the operations, which I have thus briefly reported, were going on,  the First Corps, in accordance with orders, delivered an attack in the  morning from Givenchy simultaneously with that against Neuve Chapelle,  but as the enemy's wire was insufficiently cut very little progress  could be made, and the troops at this point did little more than hold  fast to the Germans in front of them.    On the following day, March 11, the attack was renewed by the Fourth and  Indian Corps, but it was soon seen that further advance would be  impossible until the artillery had dealt effectively with the various  houses and defended localities which had held the troops up along the  entire front.    Efforts were made to direct the artillery fire accordingly, but, owing  to the weather conditions, which did not permit of aerial observations,  and the fact that nearly all the telephone communications between the  artillery observers and their batteries had been cut, it was impossible  to do so with sufficient accuracy. When our troops, who were pressing  forward, occupied a house there, it was not possible to stop our  artillery fire, and the infantry had to be withdrawn.    As most of the objects for which the operations had been undertaken had  been attained, and as there were reasons why I considered it inadvisable  to continue the attack at that time, I directed General Sir Douglas Haig  on the night of the 12th to hold and consolidate the ground which had  been gained by the Fourth and Indian Corps, and suspend further  offensive operations for the present.    The losses during these three days' fighting were, I regret to say, very  severe, numbering 190 officers and 2,337 of other ranks killed, 359  officers and 8,174 of other ranks wounded, and 23 officers and 1,720 of  other ranks missing. But the results attained were, in my opinion, wide  and far-reaching.    _Referring to the severity of the casualties in action, the Commander in  Chief writes:_    I can well understand how deeply these casualties are felt by the nation  at large, but each daily report shows clearly that they are endured on  at least an equal scale by all the combatants engaged throughout Europe,  friends and foe alike.    In war as it is today, between civilized nations armed to the teeth with  the present deadly rifle and machine gun, heavy casualties are  absolutely unavoidable. For the slightest undue exposure the heaviest  toll is exacted. The power of defense conferred by modern weapons is the  main cause for the long duration of the battles of the present day, and  it is this fact which mainly accounts for such loss and waste of life.  Both one and the other can, however, be shortened and lessened if  attacks can be supported by a most efficient and powerful force of  artillery available; but an almost unlimited supply of ammunition is  necessary, and a most liberal discretionary power as to its use must be  given to artillery commanders. I am confident that this is the only  means by which great results can be obtained with a minimum of loss.          ROBERTS OF KANDAHAR.    SIDNEY LOW, in The London Times.          Through the long years of peril and of strife,      He faced Death oft, and Death forbore to slay,      Reserving for its sacrificial Day,      The garnered treasure of his full-crowned life;      So saved him till the furrowed soil was rife,      With the rich tillage of our noblest dead;      Then reaped the offering of his honored head,      In that red field of harvest, where he died,      With the embattled legions at his side.          The Surrender of Przemysl    How Galicia's Strong Fortress Yielded to the Russian Siege           The Austrian fortress of Przemysl fell on March 22, 1915,       after an investment and siege which lasted, with one short       interruption, for nearly four months. This important event was       celebrated by a Te Deum of thanksgiving in the presence of the       Czar and the General Staff. The importance to the Russians of       the capitulation of Przemysl is suggested by the fact that       about 120,000 prisoners were reported taken when the Austrians       yielded. Until this was effected the Russians could not       venture upon a serious invasion of Hungary, and the investing       troops who were then freed were more numerous than the       defenders.    [By the Correspondent of The London Times.]    PETROGRAD, March 22.    The Minister of War has informed me that he has just received a telegram  from the Grand Duke Nicholas announcing the fall of Przemysl.    The fall of Przemysl marks the most important event of the Russian  campaign this year. It finally and irrevocably consolidates the position  of the Russians in Galicia. The Austro-German armies are deprived of the  incentive hitherto held out to them of relieving the isolated remnant of  their former dominion. The besieging army will be freed for other  purposes. From information previously published the garrison aggregated  about 25,000 men, hence the investing forces, which must always be at  least four times as great as the garrison, represent not less than  100,000 men. From all the information lately received from both Russian  and neutral sources, the position of the Austro-German armies in the  Carpathians has become distinctly critical. The reinforcements for the  gallant troops of General Brusiloff, General Radko Dmitrieff, and other  commanders are bound to exercise an enormous influence on the future  course of the campaign in the Carpathians.    All honor and credit are given by the Russians to the garrison of  Przemysl and General Kusmanek. Russian officers ever had the highest  opinion of the personality of the commandant. I heard from those who  fought under General Radko Dmitrieff in the early stages of the Galician  campaign that when our troops, after sweeping away the resistance at  Lwow and Jaroslau, loudly knocked at the doors of the fortress of  Przemysl, they met with a stern rebuff. In reply to the summons of the  Russians to surrender the keys the commandant wrote a curt and dignified  note remarking that he considered it beyond his own dignity or the  dignity of the Russian General to discuss the surrender of the fortress  before it had exhausted all its powers of resistance. During the second  invasion of Poland by the Austro-German armies the enemy's lines swept  up to and just beyond Przemysl, interrupting the investment of the  fortress. The wave of the Austrian invasion began to subside at the end  of the first week in November. Only then could we begin the siege of the  mighty fortress, which proved successful after the lapse of four months.    The first Russian attempt to storm Przemysl without previous  bombardment, which followed immediately upon the commandant's refusal to  surrender, resulted in very great loss of life to no purpose. Thereafter  it was decided to abstain from further attempts to take the fortress  until our siege guns could be placed and a preliminary bombardment could  sufficiently facilitate the task of the besiegers. Meanwhile, although  the fortress and town were duly invested, our lines were somewhat remote  from the outlying forts, and the peasants of adjacent villages were, it  is said, able to pass freely to and from the town of Przemysl--a fact  which would enable the inhabitants to obtain supplies. From all  accounts neither the garrison nor the inhabitants were reduced to very  great straits for food. The announcement made at the time of the first  investment of the fortress that provisions and supplies would easily  last till May was, however, obviously exaggerated.    I understand that heavy siege guns were ready to be conveyed to Przemysl  at the end of January, but that the Russian military authorities decided  to postpone their departure in view of the determined attempts made by  the Austro-German forces to pierce the Russian lines in the Carpathians  in order to relieve the fortress, which, if successful, might have  endangered the safety of the siege material. Owing to this fact the  bombardment of Przemysl began only about a fortnight ago, when the  Austro-German offensive had so far weakened as to satisfy the Russian  authorities that there was no further danger from this quarter.    The concluding stages of the siege have been related in the dispatches  from the Field Headquarters during the past week. The capture of the  dominating heights in the eastern sector followed close upon the first  bombardment. The final desperate sortie led by General Kusmanek at the  head of the Twenty-third Division of the Honved precipitated the end.  The remnants of the garrison were unable to man the works extending to a  thirty-mile periphery.    The loss of the western approaches left General Kusmanek no alternative  but to surrender."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#3)"],[1," WASHINGTON, D.C., APRIL 22, 1915.    Despite this warning, relying on President Wilson's note to Germany of  Feb. 10, 1915, which declared that the United States would \"hold the  Imperial Government of Germany to a strict accountability\" for such an  act within the submarine zone; relying, also, on the speed of the ship,  and hardly conceiving that the threat would be carried out, over two  thousand men, women, and children embarked. The total toll of the dead  was 1,150, of whom 114 were known to be American citizens.    The German Embassy's warning advertisement was repeated on May 8, the  day following the loss of the Lusitania. On May 12 the German Embassy  notified the newspapers to discontinue publication of the advertisement,  which had been scheduled to appear for the third time on the following  Saturday.]      GERMAN OFFICIAL REPORT.    [By The Associated Press.]    _BERLIN, May 14, (via Amsterdam to London, May 15.)--From the report  received from the submarine which sank the Cunard Line steamer Lusitania  last Friday the following official version of the incident is published  by the Admiralty Staff over the signature of Admiral Behncke:_    The submarine sighted the steamer, which showed no flag, May 7 at 2:20  o'clock, Central European time, afternoon, on the southeast coast of  Ireland, in fine, clear weather.    At 3:10 o'clock one torpedo was fired at the Lusitania, which hit her  starboard side below the Captain's bridge. The detonation of the torpedo  was followed immediately by a further explosion of extremely strong  effect. The ship quickly listed to starboard and began to sink.    The second explosion must be traced back to the ignition of quantities  of ammunition inside the ship.    _It appears from this report that the submarine sighted the Lusitania at  1:20 o'clock, London time, and fired the torpedo at 2:10 o'clock, London  time. The Lusitania, according to all reports, was traveling at the rate  of eighteen knots an hour. As fifty minutes elapsed between the sighting  and the torpedoing, the Lusitania when first seen from the submarine  must have been distant nearly fifteen knots, or about seventeen land  miles. The Lusitania must have been recognized at the first appearance  of the tops of her funnels above the horizon. To the Captain on the  bridge of the Lusitania the submarine would have been at that time  invisible, being below the horizon._    [Illustration: Map Showing Locations of Ships Attacked in Submarine War  Zone with American Citizens Aboard.]      BRITISH CORONER'S VERDICT.    [By The Associated Press.]    _KINSALE, Ireland, May 10.--The verdict, rendered here today by the  coroner's jury, which investigated five deaths resulting from the  torpedoing of the Lusitania, is as follows:_    We find that the deceased met death from prolonged immersion and  exhaustion in the sea eight miles south-southeast of Old Head of  Kinsale, Friday, May 7, 1915, owing to the sinking of the Lusitania by  torpedoes fired by a German, submarine.    We find that the appalling crime was committed contrary to international  law and the conventions of all civilized nations.    We also charge the officers of said submarine and the Emperor and the  Government of Germany, under whose orders they acted, with the crime of  wholesale murder before the tribunal of the civilized world.    We desire to express sincere condolences and sympathy with the relatives  of the deceased, the Cunard Company, and the United States, many of  whose citizens perished in this murderous attack on an unarmed liner.      GERMAN NOTE OF REGRET.    _BERLIN, (via London,) May 10.--The following dispatch has been sent by  the German Foreign Office to the German Embassy at Washington:_    Please communicate the following to the State Department: The German  Government desires to express its deepest sympathy at the loss of lives  on board the Lusitania. The responsibility rests, however, with the  British Government, which, through its plan of starving the civilian  population of Germany, has forced Germany to resort to retaliatory  measures.    In spite of the German offer to stop the submarine war in case the  starvation plan was given up, British merchant vessels are being  generally armed with guns and have repeatedly tried to ram submarines,  so that a previous search was impossible.    They cannot, therefore, be treated as ordinary merchant vessels. A  recent declaration made to the British Parliament by the Parliamentary  Secretary in answer to a question by Lord Charles Beresford said that at  the present practically all British merchant vessels were armed and  provided with hand grenades.    Besides, it has been openly admitted by the English press that the  Lusitania on previous voyages repeatedly carried large quantities of war  material. On the present voyage the Lusitania carried 5,400 cases of  ammunition, while the rest of her cargo also consisted chiefly of  contraband.    If England, after repeated official and unofficial warnings, considered  herself able to declare that that boat ran no risk and thus  light-heartedly assumed responsibility for the human life on board a  steamer which, owing to its armament and cargo, was liable to  destruction, the German Government, in spite of its heartfelt sympathy  for the loss of American lives, cannot but regret that Americans felt  more inclined to trust to English promises rather than to pay attention  to the warnings from the German side.    FOREIGN OFFICE.      ENGLAND ANSWERS GERMANY.[A]    [By The Associated Press.]    [Footnote A: In Germany's reply to the American protest against certain  features of the \"war zone\" order, which was received in Washington on  Feb. 14, occurred this expression:         If the United States ... should succeed at the last moment in       removing the grounds which make that procedure [submarine       warfare on merchant vessels] an obligatory duty for Germany       ... and thereby make possible for Germany legitimate       importation of the necessaries of life and industrial raw       material, then the German Government ... would gladly draw       conclusions from the new situation.    In the German note to the American Government justifying the sinking of  the Lusitania presented above, appears this clause:         In spite of the German offer to stop the submarine war in case       the starvation plan was given up....    These two expressions are referred to in the British official statement,  published herewith, in these words:         It was not understood from the reply of the German Government       [of Feb. 14] that they were prepared to abandon the principle       of sinking British vessels by submarine.    Whether this may regarded as an opening for the renewal of the German  offer in explicit terms, with the implication that England might accept  it, is not explained.]      _LONDON, Wednesday, May 12.--Inquiry in official circles elicited last  night the following statement, representing the official British view of  Germany's justification for torpedoing the Lusitania which Berlin  transmitted to the State Department at Washington:_    The German Government states that responsibility for the loss of the  Lusitania rests with the British Government, which through their plan of  starving the civil population of Germany has forced Germany to resort to  retaliatory measures The reply to this is as follows:    As far back as last December Admiral von Tirpitz, (the German Marine  Minister,) in an interview, foreshadowed a submarine blockade of Great  Britain, and a merchant ship and a hospital ship were torpedoed Jan. 30  and Feb. 1, respectively.    The German Government on Feb. 4 declared their intention of instituting  a general submarine blockade of Great Britain and Ireland, with the  avowed purpose of cutting off supplies for these islands. This blockade  was put into effect Feb. 18.    As already stated, merchant vessels had, as a matter of fact, been sunk  by a German submarine at the end of January. Before Feb. 4 no vessel  carrying food supplies for Germany had been held up by his Majesty's  Government except on the ground that there was reason to believe the  foodstuffs were intended for use of the armed forces of the enemy or the  enemy Government.    His Majesty's Government had, however informed the State Department on  Jan. 29 that they felt bound to place in a prize court the foodstuffs of  the steamer Wilhelmina, which was going to a German port, in view of the  Government control of foodstuffs in Germany, as being destined for the  enemy Government and, therefore, liable to capture.    The decision of his Majesty's Government to carry out the measures laid  down by the Order in Council was due to the action of the German  Government in insisting on their submarine blockade.    This, added to other infractions of international law by Germany, led to  British reprisals, which differ from the German action in that his  Majesty's Government scrupulously respect the lives of noncombatants  traveling in merchant vessels, and do not even enforce the recognized  penalty of confiscation for a breach of the blockade, whereas the German  policy is to sink enemy or neutral vessels at sight, with total  disregard for the lives of noncombatants and the property of neutrals.    The Germans state that, in spite of their offer to stop their submarine  war in case the starvation plan was given up, Great Britain has taken  even more stringent blockade measures. The answer to this is as follows:    It was not understood from the reply of the German Government that they  were prepared to abandon the principle of sinking British vessels by  submarine.    They have refused to abandon the use of mines for offensive purposes on  the high seas on any condition. They have committed various other  infractions of international law, such as strewing the high seas and  trade routes with mines, and British and neutral vessels will "]]]
