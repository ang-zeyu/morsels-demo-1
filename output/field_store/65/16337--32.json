The P.D.'s out-Wegg Mr.  Wegg in the matter of dropping into poetry, and although its quality  cannot be presumed to approach that selected by that famous individual  for the delectation of Mr. Boffin, it being, not to mention the matter  of theme, very often afflicted with a deplorable weakness or strength  in its feet, yet it can be said of it, as in the case of Mercutio's  wound, that it serves.    [Illustration: CORNER IN THE \"P.D.'S\" ROOMS.]    Most of these literary efforts eventually find a place in the  scrapbook, and their perusal reminds us of many a joyous evening.      \"We seem to see, to taste, to hear,    Joys that have passed; who say too fleet    The rush of time? Things passed are dear.\"    This, then, is a slight account of the P.D.'s, and if their doings be  branded as folly, it is to them at least a very innocent and delicious  sort of folly, and just the thing to free them from the perplexing  problems of the day and fit them to grapple with a freshened and  renewed energy those of the morrow.          Notes.      The new office building of the Chicago Varnish Company, now in the  course of erection at the corner of Dearborn Avenue and Kinzie Street,  Chicago, from the designs of Mr. Henry Ives Cobb, covers a plat of  ground 45 x 90 feet. It is in the style of the brick architecture of  Holland, which has been recently adopted in several instances in New  York and Philadelphia, notably by Mr. Frank Miles Day and Mr. R.W.  Gibson. It is to be built of St. Louis red pressed brick with Bedford  stone trimmings, and will be a noticeable building even in Chicago,  where there is so much of architectural interest. The interior will  be handsomely finished in natural woods. The company will occupy a  considerable part of the building, but a portion of it will be rented  for other office purposes.    [Illustration: LXXIX. Manoir d'Ango, Normandy.]    [Illustration: BUILDING OF CHICAGO VARNISH CO., CHICAGO.]    Many a new building that is approaching its first winter will be found  lacking if its architect forgot the specification of the Folsom Snow  Guard. A great many buildings do not need this device, but where one  does, it needs it badly. It is so cheap, so simple and so perfectly  effective that it should be used where there is the least chance of  danger or inconvenience from snow sliding off the roof.    The development of the kitchen range has been along certain well  defined lines, the ornament changed, new parts nickeled, dimensions  varied, etc., but it has remained the same old stove. The Walker  & Pratt Mfg. Co., of Boston, have made a move towards an entirely  different style, in their \"Culinet,\" which is illustrated on this  page. It presents many good points. The cooking surface is at the  same height as an ordinary table. The oven is about the height of  the elbow, making it convenient of access, and greatly lessening  the danger of burning the arms in using it. The fire, broiler door,  clinker door, and ash-pan door are all in front. All holes are hot,  and the oven is heated on six sides, making it not only an even baker,  but a sure baker on the bottom. One damper does the whole regulating  business. A guard rail to keep the clothes from contact with the  heated surface and convenient towel driers are also provided. There is  no nickel finish, but solid bronze instead. These are features which  should recommend it to architects; besides which it is compact, and  occupies little floor space, durable, and made with the same care in  every detail that has characterized the Walker & Pratt goods for forty  years. It is a kitchen ornament, as well as a kitchen help.    [Illustration] [Transcriber's Note: Lady using \"Culinet.\"]    \"The Making of a Range\" is a cleverly prepared little pamphlet, fully  illustrated, that was issued primarily for distribution from the  Mechanics' Fair (Boston) exhibit of the Walker & Pratt Mfg. Co. It  is well worth sending for, if one is interested in details of  manufacture. The \"Culinet\" was the only stove which was awarded a Gold  Medal at the Mechanics' Fair.    [Illustration: LXXX. Manoir d'Ango, Normandy.]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#3)"],[1,"to be  so well understood, really is; for some imagine death to be the  departure of the soul from the body; others think that there is no such  departure, but that soul and body perish together, and that the soul is  extinguished with the body. Of those who think that the soul does  depart from the body, some believe in its immediate dissolution; others  fancy that it continues to exist for a time; and others believe that it  lasts forever. There is great dispute even what the soul is, where it  is, and whence it is derived: with some, the heart itself (_cor_) seems  to be the soul, hence the expressions, _excordes_, _vecordes_,  _concordes;_ and that prudent Nasica, who was twice consul, was called  Corculus, _i.e._, wise-heart; and AElius Sextus is described as  _Egregie_ cordatus _homo, catus AEliu' Sextus_--that great  _wise-hearted_ man, sage AElius. Empedocles imagines the blood, which is  suffused over the heart, to be the soul; to others, a certain part of  the brain seems to be the throne of the soul; others neither allow the  heart itself, nor any portion of the brain, to be the soul, but think  either that the heart is the seat and abode of the soul, or else that  the brain is so. Some would have the soul, or spirit, to be the  _anima_, as our schools generally agree; and indeed the name signifies  as much, for we use the expressions _animam agere_, to live; _animam  efflare_, to expire; _animosi_, men of spirit; _bene animati_, men of  right feeling; _exanimi sententia_, according to our real opinion; and  the very word _animus_ is derived from _anima_. Again, the soul seems  to Zeno the Stoic to be fire.    X. But what I have said as to the heart, the blood, the brain, air, or  fire being the soul, are common opinions: the others are only  entertained by individuals; and, indeed, there were many among the  ancients who held singular opinions on this subject, of whom the latest  was Aristoxenus, a man who was both a musician and a philosopher. He  maintained a certain straining of the body, like what is called harmony  in music, to be the soul, and believed that, from the figure and nature  of the whole body, various motions are excited, as sounds are from an  instrument. He adhered steadily to his system, and yet he said  something, the nature of which, whatever it was, had been detailed and  explained a great while before by Plato. Xenocrates denied that the  soul had any figure, or anything like a body; but said it was a number,  the power of which, as Pythagoras had fancied, some ages before, was  the greatest in nature: his master, Plato, imagined a threefold soul, a  dominant portion of which--that is to say, reason--he had lodged in the  head, as in a tower; and the other two parts--namely, anger and  desire--he made subservient to this one, and allotted them distinct  abodes, placing anger in the breast, and desire under the praecordia.  But Dicaearchus, in that discourse of some learned disputants, held at  Corinth, which he details to us in three books--in the first book  introduces many speakers; and in the other two he introduces a certain  Pherecrates, an old man of Phthia, who, as he said, was descended from  Deucalion; asserting, that there is in fact no such thing at all as a  soul, but that it is a name without a meaning; and that it is idle to  use the expression \"animals,\" or \"animated beings;\" that neither men  nor beasts have minds or souls, but that all that power by which we act  or perceive is equally infused into every living creature, and is  inseparable from the body, for if it were not, it would be nothing; nor  is there anything whatever really existing except body, which is a  single and simple thing, so fashioned as to live and have its  sensations in consequence of the regulations of nature. Aristotle, a  man superior to all others, both in genius and industry (I always  except Plato), after having embraced these four known sorts of  principles, from which all things deduce their origin, imagines that  there is a certain fifth nature, from whence comes the soul; for to  think, to foresee, to learn, to teach, to invent anything, and many  other attributes of the same kind, such as to remember, to love, to  hate, to desire, to fear, to be pleased or displeased--these, and  others like them, exist, he thinks, in none of those first four kinds:  on such account he adds a fifth kind, which has no name, and so by a  new name he calls the soul [Greek: endelecheia], as if it were a  certain continued and perpetual motion.    XI. If I have not forgotten anything unintentionally, these are the  principal opinions concerning the soul. I have omitted Democritus, a  very great man indeed, but one who deduces the soul from the fortuitous  concourse of small, light, and round substances; for, if you believe  men of his school, there is nothing which a crowd of atoms cannot  effect. Which of these opinions is true, some God must determine. It is  an important question for us, Which has the most appearance of truth?  Shall we, then, prefer determining between them, or shall we return to  our subject?    _A._ I could wish both, if possible; but it is difficult to mix them:  therefore, if without a discussion of them we can get rid of the fears  of death, let us proceed to do so; but if this is not to be done  without explaining the question about souls, let us have that now, and  the other at another time.    _M._ I take that plan to be the best, which I perceive you are inclined  to; for reason will demonstrate that, whichever of the opinions which I  have stated is true, it must follow, then, that death cannot be an  evil; or that it must rather be something desirable; for if either the  heart, or the blood, or the brain, is the soul, then certainly the  soul, being corporeal, must perish with the rest of the body; if it is  air, it will perhaps be dissolved; if it is fire, it will be  extinguished; if it is Aristoxenus's harmony, it will be put out of  tune. What shall I say of Dicaearchus, who denies that there is any  soul? In all these opinions, there is nothing to affect any one after  death; for all feeling is lost with life, and where there is no  sensation, nothing can interfere to affect us. The opinions of others  do indeed bring us hope; if it is any pleasure to you to think that  souls, after they leave the body, may go to heaven as to a permanent  home.    _A._ I have great pleasure in that thought, and it is what I most  desire; and even if it should not be so, I should still be very willing  to believe it.    _M._ What occasion have you, then, for my assistance? Am I superior to  Plato in eloquence? Turn over carefully his book that treats of the  soul; you will have there all that you can want.    _A._ I have, indeed, done that, and often; but, I know not how it comes  to pass, I agree with it while I am reading it; but when I have laid  down the book, and begin to reflect with myself on the immortality of  the soul, all that agreement vanishes.    _M._ How comes that? Do you admit this--that souls either exist after  death, or else that they also perish at the moment of death?    _A._ I agree to that. And if they do exist, I admit that they are  happy; but if they perish, I cannot suppose them to be unhappy,  because, in fact, they have no existence at all. You drove me to that  concession but just now.    _M._ How, then, can you, or why do you, assert that you think that  death is an evil, when it either makes us happy, in the case of the  soul continuing to exist, or, at all events, not unhappy, in the case  of our becoming destitute of all sensation?    XII. _A._ Explain, therefore, if it is not troublesome to you, first,  if you can, that souls do exist after death; secondly, should you fail  in that (and it is a very difficult thing to establish), that death is  free from all evil; for I am not without my fears that this itself is  an evil: I do not mean the immediate deprivation of sense, but the fact  that we shall hereafter suffer deprivation.    _M._ I have the best authority in support of the opinion you desire to  have established, which ought, and generally has, great weight in all  cases. And, first, I have all antiquity on that side, which the more  near it is to its origin and divine descent, the more clearly, perhaps,  on that account, did it discern the truth in these matters. This very  doctrine, then, was adopted by all those ancients whom Ennius calls in  the Sabine tongue Casci; namely, that in death there was a sensation,  and that, when men departed this life, they were not so entirely  destroyed as to perish absolutely. And this may appear from many other  circumstances, and especially from the pontifical rites and funeral  obsequies, which men of the greatest genius would not have been so  solicitous about, and would not have guarded from any injury by such  severe laws, but from a firm persuasion that death was not so entire a  destruction as wholly to abolish and destroy everything, but rather a  kind of transmigration, as it were, and change of life, which was, in  the case of illustrious men and women, usually a guide to heaven, while  in that of others it was still confined to the earth, but in such a  manner as still to exist. From this, and the sentiments of the Romans,        In heaven Romulus with Gods now lives,    as Ennius saith, agreeing with the common belief; hence, too, Hercules  is considered so great and propitious a God among the Greeks, and from  them he was introduced among us, and his worship has extended even to  the very ocean itself. This is how it was that Bacchus was deified, the  offspring of Semele; and from the same illustrious fame we receive  Castor and Pollux as Gods, who are reported not only to have helped the  Romans to victory in their battles, but to have been the messengers of  their success.
