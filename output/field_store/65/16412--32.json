For such was the effect of cold  and hunger and chains upon him, that before the messenger returned from  the diviner, he was dead. And my father and family are angry with me for  taking the part of the murderer and prosecuting my father. They say  that he did not kill him, and that if he did, the dead man was but a  murderer, and I ought not to take any notice, for that a son is impious  who prosecutes a father. Which shows, Socrates, how little they know  what the gods think about piety and impiety.    SOCRATES: Good heavens, Euthyphro! and is your knowledge of religion  and of things pious and impious so very exact, that, supposing the  circumstances to be as you state them, you are not afraid lest you too  may be doing an impious thing in bringing an action against your father?    EUTHYPHRO: The best of Euthyphro, and that which distinguishes him,  Socrates, from other men, is his exact knowledge of all such matters.  What should I be good for without it?    SOCRATES: Rare friend! I think that I cannot do better than be your  disciple. Then before the trial with Meletus comes on I shall challenge  him, and say that I have always had a great interest in religious  questions, and now, as he charges me with rash imaginations and  innovations in religion, I have become your disciple. You, Meletus, as  I shall say to him, acknowledge Euthyphro to be a great theologian, and  sound in his opinions; and if you approve of him you ought to approve of  me, and not have me into court; but if you disapprove, you should begin  by indicting him who is my teacher, and who will be the ruin, not of the  young, but of the old; that is to say, of myself whom he instructs,  and of his old father whom he admonishes and chastises. And if Meletus  refuses to listen to me, but will go on, and will not shift the  indictment from me to you, I cannot do better than repeat this challenge  in the court.    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, indeed, Socrates; and if he attempts to indict me I am  mistaken if I do not find a flaw in him; the court shall have a great  deal more to say to him than to me.    SOCRATES: And I, my dear friend, knowing this, am desirous of becoming  your disciple. For I observe that no one appears to notice you--not even  this Meletus; but his sharp eyes have found me out at once, and he has  indicted me for impiety. And therefore, I adjure you to tell me the  nature of piety and impiety, which you said that you knew so well, and  of murder, and of other offences against the gods. What are they? Is  not piety in every action always the same? and impiety, again--is it not  always the opposite of piety, and also the same with itself, having, as  impiety, one notion which includes whatever is impious?    EUTHYPHRO: To be sure, Socrates.    SOCRATES: And what is piety, and what is impiety?    EUTHYPHRO: Piety is doing as I am doing; that is to say, prosecuting any  one who is guilty of murder, sacrilege, or of any similar crime--whether  he be your father or mother, or whoever he may be--that makes no  difference; and not to prosecute them is impiety. And please to  consider, Socrates, what a notable proof I will give you of the truth  of my words, a proof which I have already given to others:--of the  principle, I mean, that the impious, whoever he may be, ought not to go  unpunished. For do not men regard Zeus as the best and most righteous of  the gods?--and yet they admit that he bound his father (Cronos) because  he wickedly devoured his sons, and that he too had punished his own  father (Uranus) for a similar reason, in a nameless manner. And yet when  I proceed against my father, they are angry with me. So inconsistent are  they in their way of talking when the gods are concerned, and when I am  concerned.    SOCRATES: May not this be the reason, Euthyphro, why I am charged with  impiety--that I cannot away with these stories about the gods? and  therefore I suppose that people think me wrong. But, as you who are well  informed about them approve of them, I cannot do better than assent to  your superior wisdom. What else can I say, confessing as I do, that  I know nothing about them? Tell me, for the love of Zeus, whether you  really believe that they are true.    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates; and things more wonderful still, of which the  world is in ignorance.    SOCRATES: And do you really believe that the gods fought with one  another, and had dire quarrels, battles, and the like, as the poets  say, and as you may see represented in the works of great artists?  The temples are full of them; and notably the robe of Athene, which is  carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea, is embroidered  with them. Are all these tales of the gods true, Euthyphro?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates; and, as I was saying, I can tell you, if you  would like to hear them, many other things about the gods which would  quite amaze you.    SOCRATES: I dare say; and you shall tell me them at some other time when  I have leisure. But just at present I would rather hear from you a  more precise answer, which you have not as yet given, my friend, to the  question, What is 'piety'? When asked, you only replied, Doing as you  do, charging your father with murder.    EUTHYPHRO: And what I said was true, Socrates.    SOCRATES: No doubt, Euthyphro; but you would admit that there are many  other pious acts?    EUTHYPHRO: There are.    SOCRATES: Remember that I did not ask you to give me two or three  examples of piety, but to explain the general idea which makes all pious  things to be pious. Do you not recollect that there was one idea which  made the impious impious, and the pious pious?    EUTHYPHRO: I remember.    SOCRATES: Tell me what is the nature of this idea, and then I shall  have a standard to which I may look, and by which I may measure actions,  whether yours or those of any one else, and then I shall be able to say  that such and such an action is pious, such another impious.    EUTHYPHRO: I will tell you, if you like.    SOCRATES: I should very much like.    EUTHYPHRO: Piety, then, is that which is dear to the gods, and impiety  is that which is not dear to them.    SOCRATES: Very good, Euthyphro; you have now given me the sort of answer  which I wanted. But whether what you say is true or not I cannot as yet  tell, although I make no doubt that you will prove the truth of your  words.    EUTHYPHRO: Of course.    SOCRATES: Come, then, and let us examine what we are saying. That thing  or person which is dear to the gods is pious, and that thing or person  which is hateful to the gods is impious, these two being the extreme  opposites of one another. Was not that said?    EUTHYPHRO: It was.    SOCRATES: And well said?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, I thought so; it was certainly said.    SOCRATES: And further, Euthyphro, the gods were admitted to have  enmities and hatreds and differences?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, that was also said.    SOCRATES: And what sort of difference creates enmity and anger? Suppose  for example that you and I, my good friend, differ about a number; do  differences of this sort make us enemies and set us at variance with one  another? Do we not go at once to arithmetic, and put an end to them by a  sum?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: Or suppose that we differ about magnitudes, do we not quickly  end the differences by measuring?    EUTHYPHRO: Very true.    SOCRATES: And we end a controversy about heavy and light by resorting to  a weighing machine?    EUTHYPHRO: To be sure.    SOCRATES: But what differences are there which cannot be thus decided,  and which therefore make us angry and set us at enmity with one another?  I dare say the answer does not occur to you at the moment, and therefore  I will suggest that these enmities arise when the matters of difference  are the just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and dishonourable.  Are not these the points about which men differ, and about which when we  are unable satisfactorily to decide our differences, you and I and all  of us quarrel, when we do quarrel? (Compare Alcib.)    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, the nature of the differences about which we  quarrel is such as you describe.    SOCRATES: And the quarrels of the gods, noble Euthyphro, when they  occur, are of a like nature?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly they are.    SOCRATES: They have differences of opinion, as you say, about good and  evil, just and unjust, honourable and dishonourable: there would  have been no quarrels among them, if there had been no such  differences--would there now?    EUTHYPHRO: You are quite right.    SOCRATES: Does not every man love that which he deems noble and just and  good, and hate the opposite of them?    EUTHYPHRO: Very true.    SOCRATES: But, as you say, people regard the same things, some as just  and others as unjust,--about these they dispute; and so there arise wars  and fightings among them.    EUTHYPHRO: Very true.    SOCRATES: Then the same things are hated by the gods and loved by the  gods, and are both hateful and dear to them?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: And upon this view the same things, Euthyphro, will be pious  and also impious?    EUTHYPHRO: So I should suppose.    SOCRATES: Then, my friend, I remark with surprise that you have not  answered the question which I asked. For I certainly did not ask you  to tell me what action is both pious and impious: but now it would seem  that what is loved by the gods is also hated by them. And therefore,  Euthyphro, in thus chastising your father you may very likely be doing  what is agreeable to Zeus but disagreeable to Cronos or Uranus, and what  is acceptable to Hephaestus but unacceptable to Here, and there may be  other gods who have similar differences of opinion.    EUTHYPHRO: But I believe, Socrates, that all the gods would be agreed as  to the propriety of punishing a murderer: there would be no difference  of opinion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#3)"],[1,"a special fine story the nicht.

Ye canna say that, feyther. It wasna wrang last nicht.    DAVID (_bitterly_). Mebbe it was, an' Lizzie had no' foun' it out.    JOHN. Aw, noo, feyther, dinna get saurcastic.    DAVID (_between anger and tears, weakly_). I canna help it. I'm  black affrontit. I was wantin' to tell wee Alexander a special  fine story the nicht, an' now here's Lizzie wi' her richt's richt  an' wrang's wrang--Och, there's nae reason in the women.    JOHN. We has to gie in to them though.    DAVID. Aye. That's why.    (_There is a pause. The old man picks up his paper again and  settles his glasses on his nose. JOHN rises, and with a spill  from the mantelpiece lights the gas there, which he then bends to  throw the light to the old man's advantage._)    DAVID. Thank ye, John. Do ye hear him?    JOHN (_erect on hearth-rug_). Who?    DAVID. Wee Alexander.    JOHN. No.    DAVID. Greetin' his heart out.    JOHN. Och, he's no greetin'. Lizzie's wi' him.    DAVID. I ken fine Lizzie's wi' him, but he's greetin' for a' her.  He was wantin' to hear yon story o' the kelpies up to Cross Hill  wi' the tram--(_Breaking his mood impatiently_) Och.    JOHN (_crossing to table and lighting up there_). It's gettin' dark  gey early. We'll shin be haein' tea by the gas.    DAVID (_rustling his paper_). Aye--(_Suddenly_) There never was a  female philosopher, ye ken, John.    JOHN. Was there no'?    DAVID. No. (_Angrily, in a gust_) An'there never will be! (_Then  more calmly_) An' yet there's an' awful lot o' philosophy about  women, John.    JOHN. Aye?    DAVID. Och, aye. They're that unreasonable, an' yet ye canna  reason them down; an' they're that weak, an' yet ye canna make  them gie in tae ye. Of course, ye'll say ye canna reason doon a  stane, or make a clod o' earth gie in tae ye.    JOHN. Will I?    DAVID. Aye. An' ye'll be richt. But then I'll tell ye a stane  will na answer ye back, an' a clod of earth will na try to  withstand ye, so how can ye argue them down?    JOHN (_convinced_). Ye canna.    DAVID. Richt! Ye canna! But a wumman _will_ answer ye back, an'  she _will_ stand against ye, an' _yet_ ye canna argue her down  though ye have strength an' reason on your side an' she's talkin'  naething but blether about richt's richt an' wrang's wrang, an'  sendin' a poor bairn off t' his bed i' the yin room an' leavin'  her auld feyther all alone by the fire in anither an'--ye  ken--Philosophy--    (_He ceases to speak and wipes his glasses again. JOHN, intensely  troubled, tiptoes up to the door and opens it a foot. The wails  of ALEXANDER can be heard muffled by a farther door. JOHN calls  off._)    JOHN. Lizzie.    (_Lizzie immediately comes into sight outside the door with a  \"Shsh.\"_)    JOHN. Yer feyther's greetin'.    LIZZIE (_with a touch of exasperation_). Och, I'm no heedin'!  There's another wean in there greetin' too, an' I'm no heedin'  him neither, an' he's greetin' twicet as loud as the auld yin.    JOHN (_shocked_). Ye're heartless, wumman.    LIZZIE (_with patience_). No, I'm no' heartless, John; but there's  too much heart in this family, an' someone's got to use their  heid.    (DAVID _cranes round the side of his chair to catch what they  are saying. She stops and comes to him kindly but with womanly  firmness._)    LIZZIE. I'm vexed ye should be disappointed, feyther, but ye see,  don't ye--    (_A singularly piercing wail from ALEXANDER goes up. LIZZIE rushes  to silence him._)    LIZZIE. Mercy! The neighbors will think we're murderin' him.    (_The door closes behind her._)    DAVID (_nodding for a space as he revolves the woman's attitude_).  Ye hear that, John?    JOHN. Whit?    DAVID (_with quiet irony_). She's vexed I should be disappointed.  The wumman thinks she's richt! Women always think they're  richt--mebbe it's that that makes them that obstinate. (_With the  ghost of a twinkle_) She's feart o' the neighbors, though.    JOHN (_stolidly_). A' women are feart o' the neighbors.    DAVID (_reverting_). Puir wee man. I telt ye he was greetin', John.  He's disappointed fine. (_Pondering_) D' ye ken whit I'm thinkin',  John?    JOHN. Whit?    DAVID. I'm thinkin' he's too young to get his ain way, an' I'm  too auld, an' it's a fine thocht!    JOHN. Aye?    DAVID. Aye. I never thocht of it before, but that's what it is.  He's no' come to it yet, an' I'm past it. (_Suddenly_) What's the  most important thing in life, John?    (JOHN _opens his mouth--and shuts it again unused._)    DAVID. Ye ken perfectly well. What is it ye're wantin' a' the  time?    JOHN. Different things.    DAVID (_satisfied_). Aye--different things! But ye want them a', do  ye no'?    JOHN. Aye.    DAVID. If ye had yer ain way ye'd hae them a', eh?    JOHN. I wud that.    DAVID (_triumphant_). Then is that no' what ye want: yer ain way?    JOHN (_enlightened_). Losh!    DAVID (_warming to it_). That's what life is, John--gettin' yer ain  way. First ye're born, an' ye canna dae anything but cry; but  God's given yer mither ears an' ye get yer way by just cryin' for  it. (_Hastily, anticipating criticism_) I ken that's no exactly in  keeping with what I've been saying aboot Alexander--but a  new-born bairnie's an awfu' delicate thing, an' the Lord gets it  past its infancy by a dispensation of Providence very unsettling  to oor poor human understandings. Ye'll notice the weans cease  gettin' their wey by juist greetin' for it as shin as they're old  enough to seek it otherwise.    JOHN. The habit hangs on to them whiles.    DAVID. It does that. (_With a twinkle_) An' mebbe, if God's gi'en  yer neighbors ears an' ye live close, ye'll get yer wey by a  dispensation o' Providence a while longer. But there's things  ye'll hae to do for yerself gin ye want to--an' ye will. Ye'll  want to hold oot yer hand, an' ye will hold oot yer hand; an' ye  'll want to stand up and walk, and ye _will_ stand up and  walk; an' ye'll want to dae as ye please, and ye _will_ dae  as ye please; and then ye are practised an' lernt in the art of  gettin' yer ain way--and ye're a man!    JOHN. Man, feyther--ye're wonderful!    DAVID (_complacently_). I'm a philosopher, John. But it goes on  mebbe.    JOHN. Aye?    David. Aye: mebbe ye think ye'd like to make ither folk mind ye  an' yer way, an' ye try, an' if it comes off ye're a big man an'  mebbe the master o' a vessel wi' three men an' a boy under ye, as  I was, John. (_Dropping into the minor_) An then ye come doon the  hill.    JOHN (_apprehensively_). Doon the hill?    DAVID. Aye--doon to mebbe wantin' to tell a wean a bit story  before he gangs tae his bed, an' ye canna dae even that. An' then  a while more an' ye want to get to yer feet an' walk, and ye  canna; an' a while more an' ye want to lift up yer hand, an' ye  canna--an' in a while more ye're just forgotten an' done wi'.    JOHN. Aw, feyther!    DAVID. Dinna look sae troubled, John. I'm no' afraid to dee when  my time comes. It's these hints that I'm done wi' before I'm dead  that I dinna like.    JOHN. What'n hints?    DAVID. Well--Lizzie an' her richt's richt and wrang's wrang when  I think o' tellin' wee Alexander a bit story before he gangs tae  his bed.    JOHN (_gently_). Ye are a wee thing persistent, feyther.    DAVID. No, I'm no' persistent, John. I've gied in. I'm a  philosopher, John, an' a philosopher kens when he's done wi'.    JOHN. Aw, feyther!    DAVID (_getting lower and lower_). It's gey interesting,  philosophy, John, an' the only philosophy worth thinkin' about is  the philosophy of growing old--because that's what we're a' doing,  a' living things. There's nae philosophy in a stane, John; he's  juist a stane, an' in a hundred years he'll be juist a stane  still--unless he's broken up, an' then he'll be juist not a  stane, but he'll no' ken what's happened to him, because he didna  break up gradual and first lose his boat an' then his hoose, an'  then hae his wee grandson taken away when he was for tellin' him  a bit story before he gangs tae his bed.--It's yon losing yer  grip bit by bit and kennin' that yer losin' it that makes a  philosopher, John.    JOHN. If I kennt what ye meant by philosophy, feyther, I'd be  better able to follow ye.    (LIZZIE _enters quietly and closes door after her._)    JOHN. Is he asleep?    LIZZIE. No, he's no' asleep, but I've shut both doors, and the  neighbors canna hear him.    JOHN. Aw, Lizzie--    LIZZIE (_sharply_). John--    DAVID. Whit was I tellin' ye, John, about weans gettin' their ain  way if the neighbors had ears an' they lived close? Was I no'  richt?    LIZZIE (_answering for JOHN with some acerbity_). Aye, ye were  richt, feyther, nae doot; but we dinna live that close here, an'  the neighbors canna hear him at the back o' the hoose.    DAVID. Mebbe that's why ye changed Alexander into the parlor an'  gied me the bed in here when it began to get cold---    LIZZIE (_hurt_). Aw, no, feyther; I brought ye in here to be  warmer--    DAVID (_placably_). I believe ye, wumman--(_with a faint  twinkle_)--but it's turned oot luckily, has it no'?    (_DAVID waits for a reply but gets none. LIZZIE fetches needlework  from the dresser drawer and sits above table. DAVID'S face and  voice take on a more thoughtful tone._)    DAVID (_musing_). Puir wee man! If he was in here you'd no' be  letting him greet his heart oot where onybody could hear him. Wud  ye?    LIZZIE (_calmly_). Mebbe I'd no'.    JOHN. Ye ken fine ye'd no', wumman.    LIZZIE. John, thread my needle an' dinna take feyther's part  against me.    JOHN (_surprised_). I'm no'.    LIZZIE. No, I ken ye're no meanin' to, but you men are that  thrang--    (_She is interrupted by a loud squall from_ DAVID, _which he  maintains, eyes shut, chair-arms gripped, and mouth open, for  nearly half a minute, before he cuts it off abruptly and "]]]
