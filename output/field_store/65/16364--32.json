The American Government, as Germany readily acknowledges, has protested  against the British procedure. In spite of these protests and protests  from other neutral States, Great Britain could not be induced to depart  from the course of action she had decided upon. Thus, for instance, the  American ship Wilhelmina recently was stopped by the British, although  her cargo was destined solely for the German civil population, and,  according to the express declaration of the German Government, was to be  employed only for this purpose.    Germany is as good as cut off from her overseas supply by the silent or  protesting toleration of neutrals, not only in regard to such goods as  are absolute contraband, but also in regard to such as, according to  acknowledged law before the war, are only conditional contraband or not  contraband at all. Great Britain, on the other hand, is, with the  toleration of neutral Governments, not only supplied with such goods as  are not contraband or only conditional contraband, but with goods which  are regarded by Great Britain, if sent to Germany, as absolute  contraband, namely, provisions, industrial raw materials, &c., and even  with goods which have always indubitably been regarded as absolute  contraband.    The German Government feels itself obliged to point out with the  greatest emphasis that a traffic in arms, estimated at many hundreds of  millions, is being carried on between American firms and Germany's  enemies. Germany fully comprehends that the practice of right and the  toleration of wrong on the part of neutrals are matters absolutely at  the discretion of neutrals, and involve no formal violation of  neutrality. Germany, therefore, did not complain of any formal violation  of neutrality, but the German Government, in view of complete evidence  before it, cannot help pointing out that it, together with the entire  public opinion of Germany, feels itself to be severely prejudiced by the  fact that neutrals, in safeguarding their rights in legitimate commerce  with Germany according to international law, have up to the present  achieved no, or only insignificant, results, while they are making  unlimited use of their right by carrying on contraband traffic with  Great Britain and our other enemies.    If it is a formal right of neutrals to take no steps to protect their  legitimate trade with Germany, and even to allow themselves to be  influenced in the direction of the conscious and willful restriction of  their trade, on the other hand, they have the perfect right, which they  unfortunately do not exercise, to cease contraband trade, especially in  arms, with Germany's enemies.    In view of this situation, Germany, after six months of patient  waiting, sees herself obliged to answer Great Britain's murderous method  of naval warfare with sharp counter-measures. If Great Britain in her  fight against Germany summons hunger as an ally, for the purpose of  imposing upon a civilized people of 70,000,000 the choice between  destitution and starvation or submission to Great Britain's commercial  will, then Germany today is determined to take up the gauntlet and  appeal to similar allies.    Germany trusts that the neutrals, who so far have submitted to the  disadvantageous consequences of Great Britain's hunger war in silence,  or merely in registering a protest, will display toward Germany no  smaller measure of toleration, even if German measures, like those of  Great Britain, present new terrors of naval warfare.    Moreover, the German Government is resolved to suppress with all the  means at its disposal the importation of war material to Great Britain  and her allies, and she takes it for granted that neutral Governments,  which so far have taken no steps against the traffic in arms with  Germany's enemies, will not oppose forcible suppression by Germany of  this trade.    Acting from this point of view, the German Admiralty proclaimed a naval  war zone, whose limits it exactly defined. Germany, so far as possible,  will seek to close this war zone with mines, and will also endeavor to  destroy hostile merchant vessels in every other way. While the German  Government, in taking action based upon this overpowering point of view,  keeps itself far removed from all intentional destruction of neutral  lives and property, on the other hand, it does not fail to recognize  that from the action to be taken against Great Britain dangers arise  which threaten all trade within the war zone, without distinction. This  a natural result of mine warfare, which, even under the strictest  observance of the limits of international law, endangers every ship  approaching the mine area. The German Government considers itself  entitled to hope that all neutrals will acquiesce in these measures, as  they have done in the case of the grievous damages inflicted upon them  by British measures, all the more so as Germany is resolved, for the  protection of neutral shipping even in the naval war zone, to do  everything which is at all compatible with the attainment of this  object.    In view of the fact that Germany gave the first proof of her good-will  in fixing a time limit of not less than fourteen days before the  execution of said measures, so that neutral shipping might have an  opportunity of making arrangements to avoid threatening danger, this can  most surely be achieved by remaining away from the naval war zone.  Neutral vessels which, despite this ample notice, which greatly affects  the achievement of our aims in our war against Great Britain, enter  these closed waters will themselves bear the responsibility for any  unfortunate accidents that may occur. Germany disclaims all  responsibility for such accidents and their consequences.    Germany has further expressly announced the destruction of all enemy  merchant vessels found within the war zone, but not the destruction of  all merchant vessels, as the United States seems erroneously to have  understood. This restriction which Germany imposes upon itself is  prejudicial to the aim of our warfare, especially as in the application  of the conception of contraband practiced by Great Britain toward  Germany--which conception will now also be similarly interpreted by  Germany--the presumption will be that neutral ships have contraband  aboard. Germany naturally is unwilling to renounce its rights to  ascertain the presence of contraband in neutral vessels, and in certain  cases to draw conclusions therefrom.    Germany is ready, finally, to deliberate with the United States  concerning any measures which might secure the safety of legitimate  shipping of neutrals in the war zone. Germany cannot, however, forbear  to point out that all its efforts in this direction may be rendered very  difficult by two circumstances: First, the misuse of neutral flags by  British merchant vessels, which is indubitably known to the United  States; second, the contraband trade already mentioned, especially in  war materials, on neutral vessels.    Regarding the latter point, Germany would fain hope that the United  States, after further consideration, will come to a conclusion  corresponding to the spirit of real neutrality. Regarding the first  point, the secret order of the British Admiralty, recommending to  British merchant ships the use of neutral flags, has been communicated  by Germany to the United States and confirmed by communication with the  British Foreign Office, which designates this procedure as entirely  unobjectionable and in accordance with British law. British merchant  shipping immediately followed this advice, as doubtless is known to the  American Government from the incidents of the Lusitania and the Laertes.    Moreover, the British Government has supplied arms to British merchant  ships and instructed them forcibly to resist German submarines. In these  circumstances, it would be very difficult for submarines to recognize  neutral merchant ships, for search in most cases cannot be undertaken,  seeing that in the case of a disguised British ship from which an attack  may be expected the searching party and the submarine would be exposed  to destruction.    Great Britain, then, was in a position to make the German measures  illusory if the British merchant fleet persisted in the misuse of  neutral flags and neutral ships could not otherwise be recognized beyond  doubt. Germany, however, being in a state of necessity, wherein she was  placed by violation of law, must render effective her measures in all  circumstances, in order thereby to compel her adversary to adopt methods  of warfare corresponding with international law, and so to restore the  freedom of the seas, of which Germany at all times is the defender and  for which she today is fighting.    Germany therefore rejoices that the United States has made  representations to Great Britain concerning the illegal use of their  flag, and expresses the expectation that this procedure will force  Great Britain to respect the American flag in the future. In this  expectation, commanders of German submarines have been instructed, as  already mentioned in the note of Feb. 4, to refrain from violent action  against American merchant vessels, so far as these can be recognized.    In order to prevent in the surest manner the consequences of  confusion--though naturally not so far as mines are concerned--Germany  recommends that the United States make its ships which are conveying  peaceful cargoes through the British war zone discernible by means of  convoys.    Germany believes it may act on the supposition that only such ships  would be convoyed as carried goods not regarded as contraband according  to the British interpretation made in the case of Germany.    How this method of convoy can be carried out is a question concerning  which Germany is ready to open negotiations with the United States as  soon as possible. Germany would be particularly grateful,"]]]
