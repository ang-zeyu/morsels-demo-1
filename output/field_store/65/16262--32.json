Now the loftiest window gleams, and now  the lower. The carved framework of the portal is marked strongly out.  At length the morning glory in its descent from heaven comes down the  stone steps one by one, and there stands the steeple glowing with  fresh radiance, while the shades of twilight still hide themselves  among the nooks of the adjacent buildings. Methinks though the same  sun brightens it every fair morning, yet the steeple has a peculiar  robe of brightness for the Sabbath.    By dwelling near a church a person soon contracts an attachment for  the edifice. We naturally personify it, and conceive its massy walls  and its dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm and meditative and  somewhat melancholy spirit. But the steeple stands foremost in our  thoughts, as well as locally. It impresses us as a giant with a mind  comprehensive and discriminating enough to care for the great and  small concerns of all the town. Hourly, while it speaks a moral to the  few that think, it reminds thousands of busy individuals of their  separate and most secret affairs. It is the steeple, too, that flings  abroad the hurried and irregular accents of general alarm; neither  have gladness and festivity found a better utterance than by its  tongue; and when the dead are slowly passing to their home, the  steeple has a melancholy voice to bid them welcome. Yet, in spite of  this connection with human interests, what a moral loneliness on  week-days broods round about its stately height! It has no kindred  with the houses above which it towers; it looks down into the narrow  thoroughfare--the lonelier because the crowd are elbowing their  passage at its base. A glance at the body of the church deepens this  impression. Within, by the light of distant windows, amid refracted  shadows we discern the vacant pews and empty galleries, the silent  organ, the voiceless pulpit and the clock which tells to solitude how  time is passing. Time--where man lives not--what is it but eternity?  And in the church, we might suppose, are garnered up throughout the  week all thoughts and feelings that have reference to eternity, until  the holy day comes round again to let them forth. Might not, then, its  more appropriate site be in the outskirts of the town, with space for  old trees to wave around it and throw their solemn shadows over a  quiet green? We will say more of this hereafter.    But on the Sabbath I watch the earliest sunshine and fancy that a  holier brightness marks the day when there shall be no buzz of voices  on the Exchange nor traffic in the shops, nor crowd nor business  anywhere but at church. Many have fancied so. For my own part, whether  I see it scattered down among tangled woods, or beaming broad across  the fields, or hemmed in between brick buildings, or tracing out the  figure of the casement on my chamber floor, still I recognize the  Sabbath sunshine. And ever let me recognize it! Some illusions--and  this among them--are the shadows of great truths. Doubts may flit  around me or seem to close their evil wings and settle down, but so  long as I imagine that the earth is hallowed and the light of heaven  retains its sanctity on the Sabbath--while that blessed sunshine lives  within me--never can my soul have lost the instinct of its faith. If  it have gone astray, it will return again.    I love to spend such pleasant Sabbaths from morning till night behind  the curtain of my open window. Are they spent amiss? Every spot so  near the church as to be visited by the circling shadow of the steeple  should be deemed consecrated ground to-day. With stronger truth be it  said that a devout heart may consecrate a den of thieves, as an evil  one may convert a temple to the same. My heart, perhaps, has no such  holy, nor, I would fain trust, such impious, potency. It must suffice  that, though my form be absent, my inner man goes constantly to  church, while many whose bodily presence fills the accustomed seats  have left their souls at home. But I am there even before my friend  the sexton. At length he comes--a man of kindly but sombre aspect, in  dark gray clothes, and hair of the same mixture. He comes and applies  his key to the wide portal. Now my thoughts may go in among the dusty  pews or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege, but soon come forth again  to enjoy the music of the bell. How glad, yet solemn too! All the  steeples in town are talking together aloft in the sunny air and  rejoicing among themselves while their spires point heavenward.  Meantime, here are the children assembling to the Sabbath-school,  which is kept somewhere within the church. Often, while looking at the  arched portal, I have been gladdened by the sight of a score of these  little girls and boys in pink, blue, yellow and crimson frocks  bursting suddenly forth into the sunshine like a swarm of gay  butterflies that had been shut up in the solemn gloom. Or I might  compare them to cherubs haunting that holy place.    About a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell  individuals of the congregation begin to appear. The earliest is  invariably an old woman in black whose bent frame and rounded  shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction which she is  eager to rest upon the altar. Would that the Sabbath came twice as  often, for the sake of that sorrowful old soul! There is an elderly  man, also, who arrives in good season and leans against the corner of  the tower, just within the line of its shadow, looking downward with a  darksome brow. I sometimes fancy that the old woman is the happier of  the two. After these, others drop in singly and by twos and threes,  either disappearing through the doorway or taking their stand in its  vicinity. At last, and always with an unexpected sensation, the bell  turns in the steeple overhead and throws out an irregular clangor,  jarring the tower to its foundation. As if there were magic in the  sound, the sidewalks of the street, both up and down along, are  immediately thronged with two long lines of people, all converging  hitherward and streaming into the church. Perhaps the far-off roar of  a coach draws nearer--a deeper thunder by its contrast with the  surrounding stillness--until it sets down the wealthy worshippers at  the portal among their humblest brethren. Beyond that entrance--in  theory, at least--there are no distinctions of earthly rank; nor,  indeed, by the goodly apparel which is flaunting in the sun would  there seem to be such on the hither side. Those pretty girls! Why will  they disturb my pious meditations? Of all days in the week, they  should strive to look least fascinating on the Sabbath, instead of  heightening their mortal loveliness, as if to rival the blessed angels  and keep our thoughts from heaven. Were I the minister himself, I must  needs look. One girl is white muslin from the waist upward and black  silk downward to her slippers; a second blushes from top-knot to  shoe-tie, one universal scarlet; another shines of a pervading yellow,  as if she had made a garment of the sunshine. The greater part,  however, have adopted a milder cheerfulness of hue. Their veils,  especially when the wind raises them, give a lightness to the general  effect and make them appear like airy phantoms as they flit up the  steps and vanish into the sombre doorway. Nearly all--though it is  very strange that I should know it--wear white stockings, white as  snow, and neat slippers laced crosswise with black ribbon pretty high  above the ankles. A white stocking is infinitely more effective than a  black one.    Here comes the clergyman, slow and solemn, in severe simplicity,  needing no black silk gown to denote his office. His aspect claims my  reverence, but cannot win my love. Were I to picture Saint Peter  keeping fast the gate of Heaven and frowning, more stern than pitiful,  on the wretched applicants, that face should be my study. By middle  age, or sooner, the creed has generally wrought upon the heart or been  attempered by it. As the minister passes into the church the bell  holds its iron tongue and all the low murmur of the congregation dies  away. The gray sexton looks up and down the street and then at my  window-curtain, where through the small peephole I half fancy that he  has caught my eye. Now every loiterer has gone in and the street lies  asleep in the quiet sun, while a feeling of loneliness comes over me,  and brings also an uneasy sense of neglected privileges and duties.  Oh, I ought to have gone to church! The bustle of the rising  congregation reaches my ears. They are standing up to pray. Could I  bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church  and lift it heavenward with a fervor of supplication, but no distinct  request, would not that be the safest kind of prayer?--\"Lord, look  down upon me in mercy!\" With that sentiment gushing from my soul,  might I not leave all the rest to him?    Hark! the hymn! This, at least, is a portion of the service which I  can enjoy better than if I sat within the walls, where the full choir  and the massive melody of the organ would fall with a weight upon me.  At this distance it thrills through my frame and plays upon my  heart-strings with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit. Heaven be  praised! I know nothing of music as a science, and the most elaborate  harmonies, if they please me, please as simply as a nurse's lullaby.  The strain has ceased, but prolongs itself in my mind with fanciful  echoes till I start from my reverie and find that the sermon has  commenced. It is my misfortune seldom to fructify in a regular way by  any but printed sermons. The first strong idea which the preacher  utters gives birth to a train of thought and leads me onward step by  step quite out of hearing of the good man's voice unless he be indeed  a son of thunder. At my open window,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#3)"],[1,"company, as we have shown, was at first a spontaneous association of  merchants; but, after it had been regularly organized, admission into  it became extremely difficult. A candidate had to enter, as it were,  \"before the mast,\" to undergo a long probation, and to rise slowly by  his merits and services. He began, at an early age, as a clerk, and  served an apprenticeship of seven years, for which he received one  hundred pounds sterling, was maintained at the expense of the company,  and furnished with suitable clothing and equipments. His probation was  generally passed at the interior trading posts; removed for years from  civilized society, leading a life almost as wild and precarious as the  savages around him; exposed to the severities of a northern winter,  often suffering from a scarcity of food, and sometimes destitute for a  long time of both bread and salt. When his apprenticeship had expired,  he received a salary according to his deserts, varying from eighty to  one hundred and sixty pounds sterling, and was now eligible to the great  object of his ambition, a partnership in the company; though years might  yet elapse before he attained to that enviable station.    Most of the clerks were young men of good families, from the Highlands  of Scotland, characterized by the perseverance, thrift, and fidelity  of their country, and fitted by their native hardihood to encounter the  rigorous climate of the North, and to endure the trials and privations  of their lot; though it must not be concealed that the constitutions  of many of them became impaired by the hardships of the wilderness, and  their stomachs injured by occasional famishing, and especially by the  want of bread and salt. Now and then, at an interval of years, they were  permitted to come down on a visit to the establishment at Montreal, to  recruit their health, and to have a taste of civilized life; and these  were brilliant spots in their existence.    As to the principal partners, or agents, who resided in Montreal and  Quebec, they formed a kind of commercial aristocracy, living in  lordly and hospitable style. Their posts, and the pleasures, dangers,  adventures, and mishaps which they had shared together in their wild  wood life, had linked them heartily to each other, so that they formed  a convivial fraternity. Few travellers that have visited Canada some  thirty years since, in the days of the M'Tavishes, the M'Gillivrays, the  M'Kenzies, the Frobishers, and the other magnates of the Northwest,  when the company was in all its glory, but must remember the round of  feasting and revelry kept up among these hyperborean nabobs.    Sometimes one or two partners, recently from the interior posts, would  make their appearance in New York, in the course of a tour of pleasure  and curiosity. On these occasions there was a degree of magnificence of  the purse about them, and a peculiar propensity to expenditure at  the goldsmith's and jeweler's for rings, chains, brooches, necklaces,  jeweled watches, and other rich trinkets, partly for their own  wear, partly for presents to their female acquaintances; a gorgeous  prodigality, such as was often to be noticed in former times in Southern  planters and West India creoles, when flush with the profits of their  plantations.    To behold the Northwest Company in all its state and grandeur, however,  it was necessary to witness an annual gathering at the great interior  place of conference established at Fort William, near what is called  the Grand Portage, on Lake Superior. Here two or three of the leading  partners from Montreal proceeded once a year to meet the partners from  the various trading posts of the wilderness, to discuss the affairs  of the company during the preceding year, and to arrange plans for the  future.    On these occasions might be seen the change since the unceremonious  times of the old French traders; now the aristocratic character of the  Briton shone forth magnificently, or rather the feudal spirit of the  Highlander. Every partner who had charge of an interior post, and a  score of retainers at his Command, felt like the chieftain of a Highland  clan, and was almost as important in the eyes of his dependents as of  himself. To him a visit to the grand conference at Fort William was  a most important event, and he repaired there as to a meeting of  parliament.    The partners from Montreal, however, were the lords of the ascendant;  coming from the midst of luxurious and ostentatious life, they quite  eclipsed their compeers from the woods, whose forms and faces had  been battered and hardened by hard living and hard service, and whose  garments and equipments were all the worse for wear. Indeed, the  partners from below considered the whole dignity of the company as  represented in their persons, and conducted themselves in suitable  style. They ascended the rivers in great state, like sovereigns making  a progress: or rather like Highland chieftains navigating their subject  lakes. They were wrapped in rich furs, their huge canoes freighted  with every convenience and luxury, and manned by Canadian voyageurs,  as obedient as Highland clansmen. They carried up with them cooks and  bakers, together with delicacies of every kind, and abundance of choice  wines for the banquets which attended this great convocation. Happy were  they, too, if they could meet with some distinguished stranger; above  all, some titled member of the British nobility, to accompany them on  this stately occasion, and grace their high solemnities.    Fort William, the scene of this important annual meeting, was a  considerable village on the banks of Lake Superior. Here, in an immense  wooden building, was the great council hall, as also the banqueting  chamber, decorated with Indian arms and accoutrements, and the trophies  of the fur trade. The house swarmed at this time with traders and  voyageurs, some from Montreal, bound to the interior posts; some from  the interior posts, bound to Montreal. The councils were held in great  state, for every member felt as if sitting in parliament, and every  retainer and dependent looked up to the assemblage with awe, as to the  House of Lords. There was a vast deal of solemn deliberation, and hard  Scottish reasoning, with an occasional swell of pompous declamation.    These grave and weighty councils were alternated by huge feasts and  revels, like some of the old feasts described in Highland castles. The  tables in the great banqueting room groaned under the weight of game  of all kinds; of venison from the woods, and fish from the lakes, with  hunters' delicacies, such as buffalos' tongues, and beavers' tails,  and various luxuries from Montreal, all served up by experienced cooks  brought for the purpose. There was no stint of generous wine, for it was  a hard-drinking period, a time of loyal toasts, and bacchanalian songs,  and brimming bumpers.    While the chiefs thus revelled in hall, and made the rafters resound  with bursts of loyalty and old Scottish songs, chanted in voices cracked  and sharpened by the northern blast, their merriment was echoed  and prolonged by a mongrel legion of retainers, Canadian voyageurs,  half-breeds, Indian hunters, and vagabond hangers-on who feasted  sumptuously without on the crumbs that fell from their table, and made  the welkin ring with old French ditties, mingled with Indian yelps and  yellings.    Such was the Northwest Company in its powerful and prosperous days, when  it held a kind of feudal sway over a vast domain of lake and forest. We  are dwelling too long, perhaps, upon these individual pictures, endeared  to us by the associations of early life, when, as yet a stripling youth,  we have sat at the hospitable boards of the \"mighty Northwesters,\"  the lords of the ascendant at Montreal, and gazed with wondering  and inexperienced eye at the baronial wassailing, and listened with  astonished ear to their tales of hardship and adventures. It is one  object of our task, however, to present scenes of the rough life of the  wilderness, and we are tempted to fix these few memorials of a transient  state of things fast passing into oblivion; for the feudal state of Fort  William is at an end, its council chamber is silent and deserted; its  banquet hall no longer echoes to the burst of loyalty, or the \"auld  world\" ditty; the lords of the lakes and forests have passed away; and  the hospitable magnates of Montreal where are they?

The traffic of  that company lay principally in the high northern latitudes, while  there were immense regions to the south and west, known to abound with  valuable peltries; but which, as yet, had been but little explored by  the fur trader. A new association of British merchants was therefore  formed, to prosecute the trade in this direction. The chief factory was  established at the old emporium of Michilimackinac, from which place the  association took its name, and was commonly called the Mackinaw Company.    While the Northwesters continued to push their enterprises into the  hyperborean regions from their stronghold at Fort William, and to hold  almost sovereign sway over the tribes of the upper lakes and rivers,  the Mackinaw Company sent forth their light perogues and barks, by Green  Bay, Fox River, and the Wisconsin, to that areas artery of the West, the  Mississippi; and down that stream to all its tributary"]]]
