Show him how  fast we can run!\"    Before Jan had finished, the two puppies were tearing madly toward the  monk and the other men. One of these strangers wore a long fur overcoat,  the other was a much younger man with kindly grey eyes. Jan won the  race, but was going so fast that he could not stop until he bumped  against this grey-eyed man, who smiled and leaned down to pat him. Jan  squirmed around and touched the hand with his nose, then edged nearer  Brother Antoine, who called the dogs about him.    It was a splendid sight to see them cross the enclosure, their great  heads held proudly, their eyes beaming with intelligence and kindness,  the strong muscles moving beneath the tawny skins, as though each one of  them, old and young, understood that the honor of his forefathers must  be guarded from any act that would injure it.    Bruno limped slowly, Jan's mother walked sedately beside him, back of  them were Jupitiere, Junon, Mars, Vulcan, Pluton, Leon, and among the  older dogs came those the same age as Jan and Rollo, followed by the  mothers with still smaller puppies. They reached a place in the yard  where all of them stopped, and though the man in the fur coat, who  stood a distance back of Brother Antoine and the younger man, called to  them, the dogs only wagged their tails and did not go any closer.    \"You will have to come further,\" said the monk. \"The dogs know that they  must not cross to you, for the first thing a puppy learns is to respect  the boundary line.\"    The fur-coated man moved to where Brother Antoine and the other man  stood, then the dogs grouped about while the monk talked to the  visitors.    \"They seem to understand every word you say,\" the old man spoke. \"Their  eyes are so intelligent.\"    \"They are living sermons on obedience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice,\"  answered Brother Antoine's gentle voice. \"Not one of these dogs would  hesitate to risk his life to save his most bitter enemy. That has been  their heritage for almost a thousand years, now.\"    \"Natural instinct counts for a great deal,\" the grey-eyed man spoke as  he looked into the upturned faces of the dogs, \"but the patient training  you give them has developed it.\"    \"The older dogs help us teach the youngsters,\" went on the monk, whose  hand rested on Jan's head. \"We send out four dogs each morning--two  younger ones and two of the old ones. One pair goes on the trail down  the Italian slope toward Aosta, the other travels the Swiss path leading  to Martigny. None of them turns back until the last cabin of refuge has  been reached, where they look to see if any person is waiting. It is not  unusual for the dogs to stay out all night in a hard storm. There have  been many instances of their remaining away for two days and nights,  without food or shelter, though at any time they could have come home.\"    \"Our guide showed us the cabin,\" interrupted the older man. \"The  footprints of the dogs proved they had been there a short time before  us. We followed their tracks until the storm covered them. It was a  lucky thing the storm did not break earlier.\"    \"The dogs would have found you, Mr. Pixley,\" the monk replied. \"You see,  since we have had a telephone from the Hospice, each time travellers  start up the trails, we know when they leave Martigny or Aosta and how  many are on the way. If they do not reach here in reasonable time, or a  storm breaks, we send out the dogs at once. It was much harder in the  other days, before we had telephones, for we could not tell how many  poor souls were struggling in the snow. The dogs seemed to understand,  too, and so they kept on searching until they believed they had found  all.\"    \"I would not have attempted this trip had I not been assured that it was  too early for a bad storm,\" said Mr. Pixley. \"It is foolhardy, not  courageous, to face these mountains in a winter storm. I cannot imagine  any one being so rash as to try it, but I suppose many do?\"    \"During the winter only poor peasants travel the Pass,\" was Brother  Antoine's answer. \"They cross from Italy to seek work in the vineyards  of France or Switzerland for the summer. When summer is over they return  home this way, because it would mean a long and expensive trip by rail,  which would take all they have earned for a whole year. An entire family  will travel together, and often the youngest will be a babe in its  mother's arms.\"    \"I should think they would wait till later in the summer, and take no  risks.\"    \"Only the good God knows when a snow storm will overtake one in the Pass  of Great St. Bernard,\" Brother Antoine said. \"Even in our summer  months, when a light shower of rain falls in the Valley below, it  becomes a heavy snow up here, and many people are taken unawares. After  winter really begins, in September, the snow is often from seven to ten  feet deep and the drifts pile up against the walls of the Hospice as  high as the third story roof.\"    \"I had planned to visit Berne,\" Mr. Pixley spoke now, \"but after this  sample of your winter weather I have decided to return home to  California. I do not enjoy snow storms. We have none where I live, you  know.\"    Brother Antoine nodded. \"Yes, I know; but I hope some day you will visit  Berne and see Barry. His skin was mounted and is kept in the Museum at  Berne. You know his record? He saved forty-two people and died in 1815,  just after the terrible storm that cost the lives of almost all the  Hospice dogs. Only three St. Bernards lived through those days--Barry,  Pluto, and Pallas. A few crawled home to die of exhaustion and cold; the  rest lie buried under thousands of feet of snow, but they all died like  heroes!\"    \"A glorious record!\" exclaimed the younger man, who had been patting  Jan while the others talked. \"I remember, when I was a very small boy,  that I found a picture in a book. It showed a St. Bernard dog digging a  man from the snow, and last night I recognized the picture in that  painting which hangs over the fireplace in the refectory.\"    \"It was a gift from a noted artist,\" replied the monk. \"The dogs used to  carry a little saddle with a warm shawl, but the extra weight was hard  on them, so we do not use the saddle any longer, but a flagon, or wooden  keg of white brandy that we call 'kirsch,' is fastened to the collar,  together with a bell, so that the tinkling will tell that help is near,  even though it may be too dark for any one to see the dog.\"    \"I notice that most of the dogs are short-haired,\" the grey-eyed man  observed. \"Such fur as this pup's would afford better protection against  the cold. He has a magnificent coat of hair!\"    \"That is the only point against him,\" said Brother Antoine. \"During the  big storm of 1815 we learned that long-haired dogs break down from the  snow clinging and freezing like a coat of mail; or the thick hair  holding moisture developed pneumonia. We brought Newfoundland dogs to  fill the kennels when only three St. Bernards were left, but the long,  heavy hair of the new breed that was part Newfoundland and part St.  Bernard proved a failure. They could not stand the snow storms. Now, we  very rarely keep a long-haired pup. He is generally sold or presented to  some one who will give him kind treatment.\"    Jan looked suddenly at Rollo and the other puppies near him. All except  himself had short hair. Now he remembered his mother's worried eyes each  time the monks had examined him. He hurried to her side and pushed her  with his nose, as he whispered, \"Mother, will they send me away because  I have long hair? You know, Brother Antoine said that I was one of the  best dogs they have had for a long time!\"    \"Don't worry, Jan,\" she soothed him. \"Even though your fur is long, you  are so strong and so like your father, who had long hair, too, that I am  sure you will be kept here. Hurry, Jan I Brother Antoine is calling you  back.\"    Jan pushed among the other dogs until he stood again at the monk's side.  The two strangers looked at Jan, and Brother Antoine touched the pup's  head lovingly.    \"His father was one of our best dogs,\" the monk spoke. \"But that was not  surprising. He was a direct descendant of Barry. Four travellers owe  their lives to Jan's father, Rex.\"    The little fellow tried not to look too proud as he listened again to  the story his mother had told him and Rollo many times.    \"Rex was guiding four men to the Hospice after a big storm last Fall. It  was the worst since 1815. The men told us the story after they reached  us. They had lost all hope, their guide had fallen down a crevasse and  they were exhausted when Rex found them. They knew that their only  chance of life was to follow him. He went ahead, moving very slowly and  looking back while he barked to encourage them. An ice-bridge had  formed. It was hidden by deep snow and they did not understand the  danger that Rex knew so well. The dog went ahead, the men keeping  closely behind him. Half way across he turned and began barking  fiercely, and as they drew nearer, he started toward them uttering  savage snarls.    \"They thought the dog had gone mad, and backed away as he advanced  threateningly. Then suddenly his snarl turned to a mournful howl that  was lost in frightful cracking as the ice-bridge broke away. Rex was  never seen again, but his warning prevented those four men from being  smothered in the chasm under hundreds of feet of snow. So, you see, this  little fellow comes of royal blood. That is why we named him 'Prince  Jan.' He looks just like his father, too!\"    Jan thrust his warm nose into Brother Antoine's hand.    \"I want to be like my father and Barry,\" he said, hoping they would  understand him, as he understood them. \"I will do my very best to be  worthy of them both!\"    The visitors and the monk did not know what Jan said, but the other dogs  understood. Bruno's dim eyes beamed on the pup.    \"You will be a credit "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#3)"],[1,"for  supremacy he feels that he has a right to be proud of himself and his  race. He looks upon the black man as the fool of the human family who  has failed in every way, whereas he, the lord of creation, has achieved  the impossible, and this comparison which is so favourable to himself  naturally leads him to set up achievement as the sole test of ability.  If asked why the African Native has never accomplished anything at all  comparable with the feats of the European or the Asiatic the average  white man will answer, without hesitation, that it is because the Native  has always lacked the necessary capacity.    The average white man has a more or less vague notion that his own proud  position at the top of human society is the result of the continuous and  assiduous use of the brain by his forefathers in the struggle for  existence under the rigorous conditions of a northern climate during  thousands of generations by which constant exercise the mental faculty  of his race grew and increased till it became, in course of time, a  heritable intellectual endowment, whereas the Natives of Africa by  failing always to make use of whatever brain power they might have been  blessed with in the beginning have suffered a continuous loss of mental  capacity.    The idea that the evolution of the human intellect is a perpetually  progressive process by means of the constant use of the brain in the  pursuits of increasing civilisation towards the eventual attainment of  god-like perfection is one that appeals strongly to the popular fancy,  and its corollary, that those who fail during long periods to make full  use of their mental equipment in the ways of advancing civilisation must  gradually lose a part, if not the whole, of their original talents, is  commonly accepted as being warranted by the teaching of modern science.    But science, as a body, does not support the view that bodily characters  and modifications acquired by an individual during his lifetime are  transmissible to his offspring; in other words, science does not, as a  body, accept the theory that the effects of use and disuse in the parent  are inherited by his children. Modern science does not, indeed,  definitely foreclose discussion of the subject, but what it says is that  the empirical issue is doubtful with a considerable balance against the  supposed inheritance of acquired characters.    Very recently evidence has, indeed, been adduced to prove that  \"Initiative in animal evolution comes by stimulation, excitation and  response in new conditions, and is followed by repetition of these  phenomena until they result in structural modifications, transmitted and  directed by selection and the law of genetics.\" The student who tenders  this evidence is Dr. Walter Kidd[12] who claims that his observations of  the growth of the hair of the harness-horse prove that the prolonged  friction caused by the harness produces heritable effects in the pattern  of the hairy coat of this animal. It is admitted by this observer that  such momentary and acute stimuli as are involved in the mutilation of  the human body by boring holes in the ears, knocking out teeth, and by  circumcision, which practices have been followed by so-called savages  during long ages, seldom, if ever, lead to inherited characters, but he  maintains that the effect of prolonged friction by the collar on the  hair on the under side of the neck of the harness-horse has produced  marks or patterns in the same place on certain young foals born by these  horses.    These observations must, of course, be submitted to strict examination  before science will pronounce its opinion. Meanwhile I may be allowed  to cite what Dr. Kidd calls an \"undesigned experiment,\" which to my mind  goes far to prove that the effects of prolonged friction on the human  body during many generations is not heritable. The custom followed by  many Bantu tribes of producing in their women an elongation of the  genital parts by constant manipulation must have been practiced during  very many generations, certainly much longer than the comparatively  recent harnessing of horses in England, for we know how tenaciously  primitive people cling to their old customs, generation after  generation, for thousands of years, and yet no instance has ever been  noticed by these people, who are very observant in these matters, of any  sign of such an inherited characteristic in any of their female  children.    The ordinary layman, though he may feel strongly interested in the  problems of heredity and evolution, has seldom the leisure or the  opportunity for the careful study of biological data, and he must  therefore leave these to the specialists in scientific enquiry, but he  is by no means precluded from using his own common-sense in drawing  conclusions from the ordinary plain facts of life observable around him.  It is when we come to consider this most important question in its  bearing upon the mental side of the human being that the ordinary layman  feels himself to be no less competent to form an opinion than the  trained man of science.    Is it possible, then, we ask, for the parent whose intellect has been  developed through training in his lifetime to transmit to his children  any portion of this acquired increment of mental capacity, or, putting  the question in more concrete terms, is it possible for a parent to  transmit to his offspring any part of that power to increase the size  and quality of the brain which may be assumed to have resulted in his  own case from mental exercise? The question must not be misunderstood.  We do not ask whether clever parents do as a rule have clever children;  what we want to know is whether the successive sharpening of the wits of  generations of people does, or does not, eventually result in  establishing a real and cumulative asset of mental capacity.    Seeing that universal education has only come about within the latter  part of the last century it must be clear that the vast majority of the  present generation of educated Europeans are descended from people who  never had any of that education which so many people nowadays regard as  essential to the development and growth of the intellectual powers. But  although education has only recently become, in various degrees, common  to all white people, the light of learning has always been kept burning,  however dimly at times, in certain places and circles, and it may,  perhaps, be possible to find people to-day who are the descendants of  those favoured few who have enjoyed, during many unbroken generations,  the privilege of liberal education. Now let us assume that there are at  present a small number of such people in the forefront of the  intellectual activity of the day, and then let us ask ourselves whether  these leaders of thought who can claim long lineal descent from learned  ancestors show any mental capacity over and above that which is  displayed by those commoners who are also in the foremost ranks of  thought and science, but who cannot lay claim to such continuous  ancestral training.    If we admit the existence of two such separate classes to-day then the  answer must surely be that there is no mental difference discernible  between them. But I think we may safely conclude that there has been  very little of the kind of descent here presumed. It would be well-nigh  impossible to find people who could prove an unbroken lineage of  educated forbears going back more than four hundred years. During the  middle ages the monks of the Church were the chief and almost sole  depositories of education and learning, and as they were bound by their  vows to life-long celibacy there could be no transmission from them to  posterity of any of that increased capacity of brain which we are  supposing as having been acquired by each individual through his own  mental exertion. We know, of course, that there were frequent lapses  from the unnatural restraint imposed on these men so that some of them  may have propagated their kind, but such illegitimate offspring was not  likely to remain within the circle of learning and therefore could not  perpetuate the line. We of to-day know full well that the son of the  common labourer whose forefathers had no education can, with equality  of opportunity, achieve as much and travel as far in any field of mental  activity as can the scion of the oldest of our most favoured families.    There does not seem to have been any augmentation of human brain power  since written records of events were begun. Indeed it would seem rather  as if there had been in many places a decrease in intellectual capacity,  as when we compare the fellahin of modern Egypt with their great  ancestors whom they resemble so closely in physical appearance that  there can be little doubt about the purity of their descent. The same  may be said about the modern descendants of the people who created \"the  glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome.\" And when we  consider the period of the Renaissance we cannot say that civilised man  of to-day is superior to those people who after centuries of stagnation  and general illiteracy were yet able to seize and develop the  long-forgotten wisdom and philosophy of antiquity.    To go still further back and to venture beyond the historical horizon  into the dim past when prehistoric man roamed over Europe is a task  manifestly beyond the powers of the ordinary layman, and here we must,  perforce, trust ourselves to the guidance of those students whose  training and special learning entitle them to speak with authority.    The so-called Piltdown skull which was discovered in 1912 is accepted as  representing the most ancient of human remains yet found in England, its  age being estimated at somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 years. In  discussing the size and arrangement of the lobes and convolutions of the  brain which this cranium must have contained, Dr."]]]
