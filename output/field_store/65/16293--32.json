Meanwhile, to guard against conceit in his new knowledge, he may at odd  moments recall Ben Jonson's lines:        \"Nor stand so much on your gentility,      Which is an airy, and mere borrowed thing,      From dead men's dust, and bones: And none of yours      Except you make, or hold it.\"          =ETIQUETTE=          CHAPTER I    WHAT IS BEST SOCIETY?      \"Society\" is an ambiguous term; it may mean much or nothing. Every human  being--unless dwelling alone in a cave--is a member of society of one sort  or another, and therefore it is well to define what is to be understood by  the term \"Best Society\" and why its authority is recognized. Best Society  abroad is always the oldest aristocracy; composed not so much of persons  of title, which may be new, as of those families and communities which  have for the longest period of time known highest cultivation. Our own  Best Society is represented by social groups which have had, since this is  America, widest rather than longest association with old world  cultivation. Cultivation is always the basic attribute of Best Society,  much as we hear in this country of an \"Aristocracy of wealth.\"    To the general public a long purse is synonymous with high position--a  theory dear to the heart of the \"yellow\" press and eagerly fostered in the  preposterous social functions of screen drama. It is true that Best  Society is comparatively rich; it is true that the hostess of great  wealth, who constantly and lavishly entertains, will shine, at least to  the readers of the press, more brilliantly than her less affluent sister.  Yet the latter, through her quality of birth, her poise, her inimitable  distinction, is often the jewel of deeper water in the social crown of her  time.    The most advertised commodity is not always intrinsically the best, but is  sometimes merely the product of a company with plenty of money to spend on  advertising. In the same way, money brings certain people before the  public--sometimes they are persons of \"quality,\" quite as often the  so-called \"society leaders\" featured in the public press do not belong to  good society at all, in spite of their many published photographs and the  energies of their press-agents. Or possibly they do belong to \"smart\"  society; but if too much advertised, instead of being the \"queens\" they  seem, they might more accurately be classified as the court jesters of  to-day.      =THE IMITATION AND THE GENUINE=    New York, more than any city in the world, unless it be Paris, loves to be  amused, thrilled and surprised all at the same time; and will accept with  outstretched hand any one who can perform this astounding feat. Do not  underestimate the ability that can achieve it: a scintillating wit, an  arresting originality, a talent for entertaining that amounts to genius,  and gold poured literally like rain, are the least requirements.    Puritan America on the other hand demanding, as a ticket of admission to  her Best Society, the qualifications of birth, manners and cultivation,  clasps her hands tight across her slim trim waist and announces severely  that New York's \"Best\" is, in her opinion, very \"bad\" indeed. But this is  because Puritan America, as well as the general public, mistakes the  jester for the queen.    As a matter of fact, Best Society is not at all like a court with an  especial queen or king, nor is it confined to any one place or group, but  might better be described as an unlimited brotherhood which spreads over  the entire surface of the globe, the members of which are invariably  people of cultivation and worldly knowledge, who have not only perfect  manners but a perfect manner. Manners are made up of trivialities of  deportment which can be easily learned if one does not happen to know  them; manner is personality--the outward manifestation of one's innate  character and attitude toward life. A gentleman, for instance, will never  be ostentatious or overbearing any more than he will ever be servile,  because these attributes never animate the impulses of a well-bred person.  A man whose manners suggest the grotesque is invariably a person of  imitation rather than of real position.    Etiquette must, if it is to be of more than trifling use, include ethics  as well as manners. Certainly what one is, is of far greater importance  than what one appears to be. A knowledge of etiquette is of course  essential to one's decent behavior, just as clothing is essential to one's  decent appearance; and precisely as one wears the latter without being  self-conscious of having on shoes and perhaps gloves, one who has good  manners is equally unself-conscious in the observance of etiquette, the  precepts of which must be so thoroughly absorbed as to make their  observance a matter of instinct rather than of conscious obedience.    Thus Best Society is not a fellowship of the wealthy, nor does it seek to  exclude those who are not of exalted birth; but it _is_ an association of  gentle-folk, of which good form in speech, charm of manner, knowledge of  the social amenities, and instinctive consideration for the feelings of  others, are the credentials by which society the world over recognizes its  chosen members.          CHAPTER II    INTRODUCTIONS      =THE CORRECT FORM=    The word \"present\" is preferable on formal occasions to the word  \"introduce.\" On informal occasions neither word is expressed, though  understood, as will be shown below. The correct formal introduction is:        \"Mrs. Jones, may I present Mr. Smith?\"    or,        \"Mr. Distinguished, may I present Mr. Young?\"    The younger person is always presented to the older or more distinguished,  but a gentleman is always presented to a lady, even though he is an old  gentleman of great distinction and the lady a mere slip of a girl.    No lady is ever, except to the President of the United States, a cardinal,  or a reigning sovereign, presented to a man. The correct introduction of  either a man or woman:    To the President,    is,        \"Mr. President, I have the honor to present Mrs. Jones, of      Chicago.\"    To a Cardinal,    is,        \"Your Eminence, may I present Mrs. Jones?\"    To a King:    Much formality of presenting names on lists is gone through beforehand; at  the actual presentation an \"accepted\" name is repeated from functionary to  equerry and nothing is said to the King or Queen except: \"Mrs. Jones.\"    But a Foreign Ambassador is presented, \"Mr. Ambassador, may I present you  to Mrs. Jones.\"    Very few people in polite society are introduced by their formal titles. A  hostess says, \"Mrs. Jones, may I present the Duke of Overthere?\" or \"Lord  Blank?\"; never \"his Grace\" or \"his Lordship.\" The Honorable is merely Mr.  Lordson, or Mr. Holdoffice. A doctor, a judge, a bishop, are addressed and  introduced by their titles. The clergy are usually Mister unless they  formally hold the title of Doctor, or Dean, or Canon. A Catholic priest is  \"Father Kelly.\" A senator is always introduced as Senator, whether he is  still in office or not. But the President of the United States, once he is  out of office, is merely \"Mr.\" and not \"Ex-president.\"      =THE PREVAILING INTRODUCTION AND INFLECTION=    In the briefer form of introduction commonly used,        \"Mrs. Worldly, Mrs. Norman,\"    if the two names are said in the same tone of voice it is not apparent who  is introduced to whom; but by accentuating the more important person's  name, it can be made as clear as though the words \"May I present\" had been  used.    The more important name is said with a slightly rising inflection, the  secondary as a mere statement of fact. For instance, suppose you say, \"Are  you there?\" and then \"It is raining!\" Use the same inflection exactly and  say, \"Mrs. Worldly?\"--\"Mrs. Younger!\"        Are you there?--It is raining!      Mrs. Worldly?--Mrs. Younger!    The unmarried lady is presented to the married one, unless the latter is  very much the younger. As a matter of fact, in introducing two ladies to  each other or one gentleman to another, no distinction is made. \"Mrs.  Smith; Mrs. Norman.\" \"Mr. Brown; Mr. Green.\"    The inflection is:        I think--it's going to rain!      Mrs. Smith--Mrs. Norman!    A man is also often introduced, \"Mrs. Worldly? Mr. Norman!\" But to a very  distinguished man, a mother would say:        \"Mr. Edison--My daughter, Mary!\"    To a young man, however, she should say, \"Mr. Struthers, have you met my  daughter?\" If the daughter is married, she should have added, \"My  daughter, Mrs. Smartlington.\" The daughter's name is omitted because it is  extremely bad taste (except in the South) to call her daughter \"Miss Mary\"  to any one but a servant, and on the other hand she should not present a  young man to \"Mary.\" The young man can easily find out her name afterward.      =OTHER FORMS OF INTRODUCTION=    Other permissible forms of introduction are:    \"Mrs. Jones, do you know Mrs. Norman?\"    or,    \"Mrs. Jones, you know Mrs. Robinson, don't you?\" (on no account say \"Do  you not?\" Best Society always says \"don't you?\")    or,    \"Mrs. Robinson, have you met Mrs. Jones?\"    or,    \"Mrs. Jones, do you know my mother?\"    or,    \"This is my daughter Ellen, Mrs. Jones.\"    These are all good form, whether gentlemen are introduced to ladies,  ladies to ladies, or gentlemen to gentlemen. In introducing a gentleman to  a lady, you may ask Mr. Smith if he has met Mrs. Jones, but you must not  ask Mrs. Jones if she has met Mr. Smith!      =FORMS OF INTRODUCTIONS TO AVOID=    Do not say: \"Mr. Jones, shake hands with Mr. Smith,\" or \"Mrs. Jones, I  want to make you acquainted with Mrs. Smith.\" Never say: \"make you  acquainted with\" and do not, in introducing one person to another, call  one of them \"my friend.\" You can say \"my aunt,\" or \"my sister,\" or \"m"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#3)"],[1," etc., in the chest he had found--his  only food--shell-fish and a keg of mildewy ship's biscuits.    He was taken, so the account ran, by his rescuers, on the barque  _Hannah_, to London, where he lived for five years. His lodgings were  in Cheapside, and it was there that he compiled his work on Atlantis,  having obtained his subject matter from the Atlantean books he had  managed to bring with him, and which, after an enormous amount of  perseverance and labour, he had translated into English. Though these  books were subsequently destroyed in a big fire that demolished the  entire street, luckily for him, he had sent his MS. to the publishers,  Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley, a week or so before the conflagration  broke out; so that he was, at any rate, spared the loss of his own  arduous and invaluable work.    The publishers did not accept the MS. at once. At that time there were  very severe laws in operation against anything savouring of witchcraft  and magic, and as the manuscript dealt at length with these subjects,  and in a manner that left no doubt whatever that he, Thomas Maitland,  had practised sorcery extensively, Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley were  forced to consider whether it would be injurious to them to publish  it. Mrs. Bettesworth was eventually consulted--as indeed she always  was, on extraordinary occasions--and her interest in the MS. being  roused, she decided in its favour. Within a week of its publication,  however, it was suppressed by law; all the copies saving three  presentation ones to the author, which he successfully concealed, were  destroyed; Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley were put in the stocks on  Ludgate Hill and fined heavily, and he, Thomas Maitland, was ordered  to be arrested, flogged and imprisoned.    \"But,\" wrote Maitland, \"I was not to be caught napping. My previous  adventures and hairbreadth escapes had rendered me unusually wary, and  perceiving a number of people, among whom were two or three sheriff's  officers, approaching my house, I at once interpreted their mission,  and climbing through a trap-door leading on to the roof of the  building, nimbly made my way to the end of the row, and slipping down  a waterpipe easily eluded my enemies. London, however, being now too  hot to hold me, I booked passage on board the _Peterkin_, a Thames  trading vessel of some eighty tons, and sailed for Boston. My flight  had been so hasty that I brought very little with me--nothing in fact  except the clothes I stood in--a stout winter suit of home-spun brown  cloth, a cloak, and a pair of good, strong leather leggings--a purse  of fifty sovereigns (all I had), a knife, pistol and two copies of my  precious book, the third copy, alas! I had left behind in my hurry.\"    After giving a few unimportant details as to his life on board ship,  Maitland went on to say:--    \"Owing to a succession of storms the _Peterkin_ was driven out of her  course, and after narrowly escaping being dashed to pieces on the  Florida reefs, Lat. 24-1/2 deg. N., Long. 82 deg. W., we ran ashore with the  loss of only two lives--the second mate and cabin boy--on the Isthmus  of Yucatan, close to the estuary of a river.[1] Here we were forced to  spend nearly a year, during which time I made several journeys of  exploration into the interior of the continent. In the course of one  of my rambles amid a dense mass of tropical foliage, I suddenly found  myself face to face with a gigantic stone Sphinx, which I at once  recognized and identified. It was Tat-Nuada, an Atlantean deity,  elaborately described in one of the burned books. Much excited, I set  to work, and, after clearing the base of the idol of fungi and other  vegetable growth adhering to it, discovered a superscription in  Atlantean dialect to the effect that the image had been set up there  by one Hullir--to commemorate the destruction of Atlantis, of which  catastrophe Hullir believed himself and his family, _i.e._ his wife  Ozilmeave and daughters, Taramoo and Niketoth, and the crew of his  yacht, the _Chaac-molre_ (ten in number), the sole survivors.    \"Here, then, to my unutterable joy, was strong corroborative evidence  of the great disaster narrated in detail in the manuscripts I had  found in Inisturk Island. The existence of Atlantis was now thoroughly  substantiated. On all sides of me I stumbled across further evidences  of these early settlers. Here, standing in bold outline on a slight  eminence, was a stone edifice adorned with symbolical carvings of  eggs, harps, mastodons, triangles, and numerous other objects, all of  which were capable of interpretation, and indicated that the building  was a temple to some god.    \"I was much struck by the extraordinary similarity in many of the  things I saw--notably in the sphinx, idols and symbols--to many I had  seen in Egypt, and to some extent in Ireland, and I at once set to  work to draw up a careful analogy between the languages of those  countries.    \"The word Banchicheisi[2] I found to contain the Celtic ban, a barrow;  and Coptic isi, plenty; whilst I recognized in the words Coulmenes,[3]  the Celtic Coul, a man's name, _i.e._ Finn, son of Coul; in  Thottirnanoge, the Coptic Thoth, _i.e._ name of ancient Egyptian  deity, and Erse Tirnanoge, the name of the wife of Oisin, the last of  the Feni; in Chaac-molree[4] the Coptic deity, re; in Ozilmeave,[5]  the Celtic Meave, a girl's name; in Taramoo,[6] the Celtic Tara, a  girl's name; and in Niketoth,[7] toth, the Erse technical form of  feminine gender; and comparing the alphabets I traced a very striking  likeness between the Atlantean--    \"[Atlantean: a] (a) and the Gaelic or Erse [Erse: A]  [Atlantean: B] (B) and the Coptic [Coptic: B]  [Atlantean: d] (d) and Erse [Erse: D]  [Atlantean: g] (g) and Erse [Erse: g]  [Atlantean: T] (T) and Coptic [Coptic: T]    \"and many of the other letters. To the Atlantean    \"[Atlantean: C, O, E, Z][8]    \"I could, however, find no likeness.    \"From all these similarities, _i.e._ in architecture, symbols,  letters, and words, I could come to no other conclusion than that  there was some strong connecting link between Atlantis and ancient  Ireland and Egypt.    \"Assuredly this great link could not have been merely due to stray  survivors of the great catastrophe! Was it not much more probable that  the earliest inhabitants of Ireland and Egypt had originally migrated  from Atlantis, carrying its language, and ways and customs with them?  Moreover, since the Atlanteans were so deeply versed in magic and  everything appertaining to the occult, this migration would account  for the mysticism that has always been so closely associated with  Egypt and Ireland, and for the psychic faculty so strongly observable  in the inhabitants of these two countries.    \"I was highly satisfied--I had proved much and my discoveries had  upset many of the theories advanced by the modern sages. I could now  positively assert that the wisdom of the world came not from the East  but from the West. It was to the golden West--to Banchicheisi, capital  of Atlantis, that humanity owed its knowledge of the sciences and  arts, and of all things good and evil. Eden, if Eden existed at all,  was not in Asia, it was in Atlantis; and the Deluge, that is recorded  in the Hebrew Bible, and is traditional in the histories of nearly  every tribe and nation, was none other than the mighty inrush of the  ocean over Atlantis, due to some abnormal submarine earthquake.    \"Of what eventually became of the Atlanteans whose relics I had so  opportunely alighted upon, I could only surmise.    \"The last record I found was on a tablet set up by Niketoth. On this  she spoke of the death of Hullir and Ozilmeave, of the inter-marriage  of the crew of the _Chaac-molre_ with native women; of the consequent  growth of the colony; and of her determination to leave it, and,  accompanied by a chosen few, to push her way further inland.[9]    \"The anxiety of my comrades to leave the continent, perforce put an  end to my explorations, and in the beginning of the year 1692--exactly  ten months after our landing--the _Peterkin_ was refloated.    \"This time nothing happened to impede our progress, and in April of  the same year, we sighted Boston. Here I remained for some months,  making many new friends, and studying magic and sorcery. But the love  of travel had laid so strong a hold on me that I again took to a  roving life. I set sail for Spain in November 1692; landed at Corunna,  and made my way to Madrid, where I arrived on January 1, 1693.\"    For the rest, Hamar had to turn to Messrs. Fox and Pool's addendum,  _i.e._ the footnote that Matt Kelson had read aloud.    Hamar was now inclined to regard the book in a very different light.  What he had read seemed to him to be set down in too simple,  straightforward, and, at the same time, detailed a manner to be other  than true. Up to the present he had not believed in ghosts and  witches, for the very simple reason that--like all sceptics--he had  never inquired into the testimony respecting them. He had pooh-poohed  the subject, because every one he knew pooh-poohed it, and also  because it had never seemed worth his while to do otherwise. But  provided he thought it would pay him, he was ready to believe in  anything--in Christianity, Mahommedanism, Buddhism, Theosophy, or  any other creed; and granted the book he had in his hands was  really written by Maitland, and Maitland was _bona fide_ (which Hamar  saw no reason to doubt), and granted, also, that Maitland was sane and  logical--which from his writing he certainly appeared to be--then  there was a certain amount in the volume that in Hamar's opinion  was \"a find.\" Needless to say, he referred to the magic of the  Atlanteans--the art through the practice of which they had got in  touch with the Powers that could endow them with riches. The actual  history of Atlantis--once he was satisfied there had been such a  place--did not"]]]
