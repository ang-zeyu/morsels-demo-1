Spallanzani had shown how the male frog during  coitus will undergo the most horrible mutilations, even decapitation, and  yet resolutely continue the act of intercourse, which lasts from four to  ten days, sitting on the back of the female and firmly clasping her with  his forelegs. Goltz confirmed Spallanzani's observations and threw new  light on the mechanism of the sexual instinct and the sexual act in the  frog. By removing various parts of the female frog Goltz found that every  part of the female was attractive to the male at pairing time, and that he  was not imposed on when parts of a male were substituted. By removing  various of the sense-organs of the male Goltz[4] further found that it was  not by any special organ, but by the whole of his sensitive system, that  this activity was set in action. If, however, the skin of the arms and of  the breast between was removed, no embrace took place; so that the sexual  sensations seemed to be exerted through this apparatus. When the  testicles were removed the embrace still took place. It could scarcely be  said that these observations demonstrated, or in any way indicated, that  the sexual impulse is dependent on the need of evacuation. Professor  Tarchanoff, of St. Petersburg, however, made an experiment which seemed to  be crucial. He took several hundred frogs (_Rana temporaria_), nearly all  in the act of coitus, and in the first place repeated Goltz's experiments.  He removed the heart; but this led to no direct or indirect stoppage of  coitus, nor did removal of the lungs, parts of the liver, the spleen, the  intestines, the stomach, or the kidneys. In the same way even careful  removal of both testicles had no result. But on removing the seminal  receptacles coitus was immediately or very shortly stopped, and not  renewed. Thus, Tarchanoff concluded that in frogs, and possibly therefore  in mammals, the seminal receptacles are the starting-point of the  centripetal impulse which by reflex action sets in motion the complicated  apparatus of sexual activity.[5] A few years later the question was again  taken up by Steinach, of Prague. Granting that Tarchanoff's experiments  are reliable as regards the frog, Steinach points out that we may still  ask whether in mammals the integrity of the seminal receptacles is bound  up with the preservation of sexual excitability. This cannot be taken for  granted, nor can we assume that the seminal receptacles of the frog are  homologous with the seminal vesicles of mammals. In order to test the  question, Steinach chose the white rat, as possessing large seminal  vesicles and a very developed sexual impulse. He found that removal of the  seminal sacs led to no decrease in the intensity of the sexual impulse;  the sexual act was still repeated with the same frequency and the same  vigor. But these receptacles, Steinach proceeded to argue, do not really  contain semen, but a special secretion of their own; they are anatomically  quite unlike the seminal receptacles of the frog; so that no doubt is thus  thrown on Tarchanoff's observations. Steinach remarked, however, that  one's faith is rather shaken by the fact that in the _Esculenta_, which  in sexual life closely resembles _Rana temporaria_, there are no seminal  receptacles. He therefore repeated Tarchanoff's experiments, and found  that the seminal receptacles were empty before coitus, only becoming  gradually filled during coitus; it could not, therefore, be argued that  the sexual impulse started from the receptacles. He then extirpated the  seminal receptacles, avoiding hemorrhage as far as possible, and found  that, in the majority of cases so operated on, coitus still continued for  from five to seven days, and in the minority for a longer time. He  therefore concluded, with Goltz, that it is from the swollen testicles,  not from the seminal receptacles, that the impulse first starts. Goltz  himself pointed out that the fact that the removal of the testicles did  not stop coitus by no means proves that it did not begin it, for, when the  central nervous mechanism is once set in action, it can continue even when  the exciting stimulus is removed. By extirpating the testicles some months  before the sexual season he found that no coitus occurred. At the same  time, even in these frogs, a certain degree of sexual inclination and a  certain excitability of the embracing center still persisted, disappearing  when the sexual epoch was over.    According to most recent writers, the seminal vesicles of mammals are  receptacles for their own albuminous secretion, the function of which is  unknown. Steinach could find no spermatozoa in these \"seminal\" sacs, and  therefore he proposed to use Owen's name of _glandulae vesiculares_. After  extirpation of these vesicular glands in the white rat typical coitus  occurred. But the capacity for _procreation_ was diminished, and  extirpation of both _glandulae vesiculares_ and _glandulae prostaticae_ led  to disappearance of the capacity for procreation. Steinach came to the  conclusion that this is because the secretions of these glands impart  increased vitality to the spermatozoa, and he points out that great  fertility and high development of the accessory sexual glands go together.    Steinach found that, when sexually mature white rats were castrated,  though at first they remained as potent as ever, their potency gradually  declined; sexual excitement, however, and sexual inclination always  persisted. He then proceeded to castrate rats before puberty and  discovered the highly significant fact that in these also a quite  considerable degree of sexual inclination appeared. They followed,  sniffed, and licked the females like ordinary males; and that this was not  a mere indication of curiosity was shown by the fact that they made  attempts at coitus which only differed from those of normal males by the  failure of erection and ejaculation, though, occasionally, there was  imperfect erection. This lasted for a year, and then their sexual  inclinations began to decline, and they showed signs of premature age.  These manifestations of sexual sense Steinach compares to those noted in  the human species during childhood.[6]    The genesic tendencies are thus, to a certain degree, independent of the  generative glands, although the development of these glands serves to  increase the genesic ability and to furnish the impulsion necessary to  assure procreation, as well as to insure the development of the secondary  sexual characters, probably by the influence of secretions elaborated and  thrown into the system from the primary sexual glands.[7]        Halban (\"Die Entstehung der Geschlechtscharaktere,\" _Archiv fuer      Gynaekologie_, 1903, pp. 205-308) argues that the primary sex      glands do not necessarily produce the secondary sex characters,      nor inhibit the development of those characteristic of the      opposite sex. It is indeed the rule, but it is not the inevitable      result. Sexual differences exist from the first. Nussbaum made      experiments on frogs (_Rana fusca_), which go through a yearly      cycle of secondary sexual changes at the period of heat. These      changes cease on castration, but, if the testes of other frogs      are introduced beneath the skin of the castrated frogs, Nussbaum      found that they acted as if the frog had not been castrated. It      is the secretion of the testes which produces the secondary      sexual changes. But Nussbaum found that the testicular secretion      does not work if the nerves of the secondary sexual region are      cut, and that the secretion has no direct action on the organism.      Pflueger, discussing these experiments (_Archiv fuer die Gesammte      Physiologie_, 1907, vol. cxvi, parts 5 and 6), disputes this      conclusion, and argues that the secretion is not dependent on the      action of the nervous system, and that therefore the secondary      sexual characters are independent of the nervous system.        Steinach has also in later experiments (\"Geschlechtstrieb und      echt Sekundaere Geschlechtsmerkmale als Folge der      innerskretorischen Funktion der Keimdrusen,\" _Zentralblatt fuer      Physiologie_, Bd. xxiv, Nu. 13, 1910) argued against any local      nervous influence. He found in _Rana fusca_ and _esculenta_ that      after castration in autumn the impulse to grasp the female      persisted in some degrees and then disappeared, reappearing in a      slight degree, however, every winter at the normal period of      sexual activity. But when the testicular substance of actively      sexual frogs was injected into the castrated frogs it exerted an      elective action on the sexual reflex, sometimes in a few hours,      but the action is, Steinach concludes, first central. The      testicular secretion of frogs that were not sexually active had      no stimulating action, but if the frogs were sexually active the      injection of their central nervous substance was as effective as      their testicular substance. In either case, Steinach concludes,      there is the removal of an inhibition which is in operation at      sexually quiescent periods.        Speaking generally, Steinach considers that there is a process of      \"erotisation\" (Erotisieurung) of the nervous center under the      influence of the internal testicular secretions, and that this      persists even when the primary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#3)"],[1,"\"not      only the primeval and most reliable source of our knowledge of      the external world or the archaeological field of psychology,\" but      a field in which work may shed light on some of the most      fundamental problems of psychic action. Groos (_Spiele der      Menschen_, pp. 8-16) also deals with the primitive character of      touch sensations.        Touch sensations are without doubt the first of all the sensory      impressions to prove pleasurable. We should, indeed, expect this      from the fact that the skin reflexes have already appeared before      birth, while a pleasurable sensitiveness of the lips is doubtless      a factor in the child's response to the contact of the maternal      nipple. Very early memories of sensory pleasure seem to be      frequently, perhaps most frequently, tactile in character, though      this fact is often disguised in recollection, owing to tactile      impression being vague and diffused; there is thus in Elizabeth      Potwin's \"Study of Early Memories\" (_Psychological Review_,      November, 1901) no separate group of tactile memories, and the      more elaborate investigation by Colegrove (\"Individual Memories,\"      _American Journal of Psychology_, January, 1899) yields no      decisive results under this head. See, however, Stanley Hall's      valuable study, \"Some Aspects of the Early Sense of Self,\"      _American Journal of Psychology_, April, 1898. Kuelpe has a      discussion of the psychology of cutaneous sensations (_Outlines      of Psychology_ [English translation], pp. 87 et seq.)        Harriet Martineau, at the beginning of her _Autobiography_,      referring to the vivid character of tactile sensations in early      childhood, remarks, concerning an early memory of touching a      velvet button, that \"the rapture of the sensation was really      monstrous.\" And a lady tells me that one of her earliest memories      at the age of 3 is of the exquisite sensation of the casual      contact of a cool stone with the vulva in the act of urinating.      Such sensations, of course, cannot be termed specifically sexual,      though they help to furnish the tactile basis on which the      specifically sexual sensations develop.        The elementary sensitiveness of the skin is shown by the fact      that moderate excitation suffices to raise the temperature, while      Heidenhain and others have shown that in animals cutaneous      stimuli modify the sensibility of the brain cortex, slight      stimulus increasing excitability and strong stimulus diminishing      it. Fere has shown that the slight stimulus to the skin furnished      by placing a piece of metal on the arm or elsewhere suffices to      increase the output of work with the ergograph. (Fere, _Comptes      Rendus Societe de Biologie_, July 12, 1902; id., _Pathologic des      Emotions_, pp. 40 et seq.)        Fere found that the application of a mustard plaster to the skin,      or an icebag, or a hot-water bottle, or even a light touch with a      painter's brush, all exerted a powerful effect in increasing      muscular work with the ergograph. \"The tonic effect of cutaneous      excitation,\" he remarks, \"throws light on the psychology of the      caress. It is always the most sensitive parts of the body which      seek to give or to receive caresses. Many animals rub or lick      each other. The mucous surfaces share in this irritability of the      skin. The kiss is not only an expression of feeling; it is a      means of provoking it. Cataglottism is by no means confined to      pigeons. The tonic value of cutaneous stimulation is indeed a      commonly accepted idea. Wrestlers rub their hands or limbs, and      the hand-shake also is not without its physiological basis.        \"Cutaneous excitations may cause painful sensations to cease. Many      massage practices which favor work act chiefly as sensorial      stimulants; on this account many nervous persons cannot abandon      them, and the Greeks and Romans found in massage not only health,      but pleasure. Lauder Brunton regards many common manoeuvres, like      scratching the head and pulling the mustache, as methods of      dilating the bloodvessels of the brain by stimulating the facial      nerve. The motor reactions of cutaneous excitations favor this      hypothesis.\" (Fere, _Travail et Plaisir_, Chapter XV, \"Influence      des Excitations du Toucher sur le Travail.\")    The main characteristics of the primitive sense of touch are its wide  diffusion over the whole body and the massive vagueness and imprecision of  the messages it sends to the brain. This is the reason, why it is, of all  the senses, the least intellectual and the least aesthetic; it is also the  reason why it is, of all the senses, the most-profoundly emotional.  \"Touch,\" wrote Bain in his _Emotions and Will_, \"is both the alpha and the  omega of affection,\" and he insisted on the special significance in this  connection of \"tenderness\"--a characteristic emotional quality of  affection which is directly founded on sensations of touch. If tenderness  is the alpha of affection, even between the sexes, its omega is to be  found in the sexual embrace, which may be said to be a method of  obtaining, through a specialized organization of the skin, the most  exquisite and intense sensations of touch.        \"We believe nothing is so exciting to the instinct or mere      passions as the presence of the hand or those tactile caresses      which mark affection,\" states the anonymous author of an article      on \"Woman in her Psychological Relations,\" in the _Journal of      Psychological Medicine_, 1851. \"They are the most general stimuli      in lower animals. The first recourse in difficulty or danger, and      the primary solace in anguish, for woman is the bosom of her      husband or her lover. She seeks solace and protection and repose      on that part of the body where she herself places the objects of      her own affection. Woman appears to have the same instinctive      impulse in this respect all over the world.\"    It is because the sexual orgasm is founded on a special adaptation and  intensification of touch sensations that the sense of touch generally is  to be regarded as occupying the very first place in reference to the  sexual emotions. Fere, Mantegazza, Penta, and most other writers on this  question are here agreed. Touch sensations constitute a vast gamut for the  expression of affection, with at one end the note of minimum personal  affection in the brief and limited touch involved by the conventional  hand-shake and the conventional kiss, and at the other end the final and  intimate contact in which passion finds the supreme satisfaction of its  most profound desire. The intermediate region has its great significance  for us because it offers a field in which affection has its full scope,  but in which every road may possibly lead to the goal of sexual love. It  is the intimacy of touch contacts, their inevitable approach to the  threshold of sexual emotion, which leads to a jealous and instinctive  parsimony in the contact of skin and skin and to the tendency with the  increased sensitiveness of the nervous system involved by civilization to  restrain even the conventional touch manifestation of ordinary affection  and esteem. In China fathers leave off kissing their daughters while they  are still young children. In England the kiss as an ordinary greeting  between men and women--a custom inherited from classic and early Christian  antiquity--still persisted to the beginning of the eighteenth century. In  France the same custom existed in the seventeenth century, but in the  middle of that century was beginning to be regarded as dangerous,[2] while  at the present time the conventional kiss on the cheek is strictly  differentiated from the kiss on the mouth, which is reserved for lovers.  Touch contacts between person and person, other than those limited and  defined by custom, tend to become either unpleasant--as an undesired  intrusion into an intimate sphere--or else, when occurring between man and  woman at some peculiar moment, they may make a powerful reverberation in  the emotional and more specifically sexual sphere. One man falls in love  with his future wife because he has to carry her upstairs with a sprained  ankle. Another dates his love-story from a romp in which his cheek  accidentally came in contact with that of his future wife. A woman will  sometimes instinctively strive to attract the attention of the man who  appeals to her by a peculiar and prolonged pressure of the hand--the only  touch contact permitted to her. Dante, as Penta has remarked, refers to  \"sight or touch\" as the two channels through which a woman's love is  revived (_Purgatorio_, VIII, 76). Even the hand-shake of a sympathetic man  is enough in some chaste and sensitive women to produce sexual excitement  or sometimes even the orgasm. The cases in which love arises from the  influence of stimuli coming through the sense of touch are no doubt  frequent, and they would be still more frequent if it were not that the  very proximity of this sense to the sexual sphere causes it to be guarded  with a care which in the case of the other senses it is impossible to  exercise. This intimacy of touch and the reaction against its sexual  approximations leads to what James has called \"the _antisexual instinct_,  the instinct of personal isolation, the actual repulsiveness to us of the  idea of intimate contact with most of the persons we meet, especially  those of our own sex.\" He refers in this connection to the unpleasantness  of the sensation felt on occupying a seat still warm from the body of  another person.[3] The Catholic Church has always recognized the risks of  vuluptuous emotion involved in tactile contacts, and the facility with  which even the most innocent contacts may take on a libidinous  character.[4]        The following observations"]]]
