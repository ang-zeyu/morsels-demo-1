She has whiskers like a goat and a lame leg!\" \"I do not,\" said the  Philosopher.    \"No matter,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \"She didn't take it, because my  wife got her out yesterday and kept her talking for two hours while  I went through everything in her bit of a house--the washboard wasn't  there.\"    \"It wouldn't be,\" said the Philosopher.    \"Maybe your honour could tell a body where it is then?\"    \"Maybe I could,\" said the Philosopher; \"are you listening?\"    \"I am,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.    The Philosopher drew his chair closer to the visitor until their knees  were jammed together. He laid both his hands on Meehawl MacMurrachu's  knees \"Washing is an extraordinary custom,\" said he. \"We are washed both  on coming into the world and on going out of it, and we take no pleasure  from the first washing nor any profit from the last.\"    \"True for you, sir,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.    \"Many people consider that scourings supplementary to these are only due  to habit. Now, habit is continuity of action, it is a most detestable  thing and is very difficult to get away from. A proverb will run where  a writ will not, and the follies of our forefathers are of greater  importance to us than is the well-being of our posterity.\"    \"I wouldn't say a word against that, sir,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.    \"Cats are a philosophic and thoughtful race, but they do not admit the  efficacy of either water or soap, and yet it is usually conceded that  they are cleanly folk. There are exceptions to every rule, and I once  knew a cat who lusted after water and bathed daily: he was an unnatural  brute and died ultimately of the head staggers. Children are nearly as  wise as cats. It is true that they will utilize water in a variety of  ways, for instance, the destruction of a tablecloth or a pinafore, and I  have observed them greasing a ladder with soap, showing in the process a  great knowledge of the properties of this material.\"    \"Why shouldn't they, to be sure?\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \"Have you  got a match, sir?\"    \"I have not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Sparrows, again, are a highly acute  and reasonable folk. They use water to quench thirst, but when they are  dirty they take a dust bath and are at once cleansed. Of course, birds  are often seen in the water, but they go there to catch fish and not to  wash. I have often fancied that fish are a dirty, sly, and unintelligent  people--this is due to their staying so much in the water, and it has  been observed that on being removed from this element they at once  expire through sheer ecstasy at escaping from their prolonged washing.\"    \"I have seen them doing it myself,\" said Meehawl. \"Did you ever hear,  sir, about the fish that Paudeen MacLoughlin caught in the policeman's  hat.\"    \"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"The first person who washed was  possibly a person seeking a cheap notoriety. Any fool can wash himself,  but every wise man knows that it is an unnecessary labour, for nature  will quickly reduce him to a natural and healthy dirtiness again. We  should seek, therefore, not how to make ourselves clean, but how to  attain a more unique and splendid dirtiness, and perhaps the accumulated  layers of matter might, by ordinary geologic compulsion, become  incorporated with the human cuticle and so render clothing  unnecessary--\"    \"About that washboard,\" said Meehawl, \"I was just going to say--\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said the Philosopher. \"In its proper place I admit  the necessity for water. As a thing to sail a ship on it can scarcely be  surpassed (not, you will understand, that I entirely approve of ships,  they tend to create and perpetuate international curiosity and the  smaller vermin of different latitudes). As an element wherewith to put  out a fire, or brew tea, or make a slide in winter it is useful, but in  a tin basin it has a repulsive and meagre aspect.--Now as to your wife's  washboard--\"    \"Good luck to your honour,\" said Meehawl.    \"Your wife says that either the fairies or a woman with a goat's leg has  it.\"    \"It's her whiskers,\" said Meehawl.    \"They are lame,\" said the Philosopher sternly.    \"Have it your own way, sir, I'm not certain now how the creature is  afflicted.\"    \"You say that this unhealthy woman has not got your wife's washboard. It  remains, therefore, that the fairies have it.\"    \"It looks that way,\" said Meehawl.    \"There are six clans of fairies living in this neighbourhood; but the  process of elimination, which has shaped the world to a globe, the ant  to its environment, and man to the captaincy of the vertebrates, will  not fail in this instance either.\"    \"Did you ever see anything like the way wasps have increased this  season?\" said Meehawl; \"faith, you can't sit down anywhere but your  breeches--\"    \"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Did you leave out a pan of milk on  last Tuesday?\"    \"I did then.\"    \"Do you take off your hat when you meet a dust twirl?\"    \"I wouldn't neglect that,\" said Meehawl.    \"Did you cut down a thorn bush recently?\"    \"I'd sooner cut my eye out,\" said Meehawl, \"and go about as wall-eyed  as Lorcan O'Nualain's ass: I would that. Did you ever see his ass, sir?  It--\"    \"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Did you kill a robin redbreast?\"    \"Never,\" said Meehawl. \"By the pipers,\" he added, \"that old skinny cat  of mine caught a bird on the roof yesterday.\"    \"Hah!\" cried the Philosopher, moving, if it were possible, even closer  to his client, \"now we have it. It is the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca  Mora took your washboard. Go to the Gort at once. There is a hole under  a tree in the south-east of the field. Try what you will find in that  hole.\"    \"I'll do that,\" said Meehawl. \"Did you ever-\"    \"I did not,\" said the Philosopher.    So Meehawl MacMurrachu went away and did as he had been bidden, and  underneath the tree of Gort na Cloca Mora he found a little crock of  gold.    \"There's a power of washboards in that,\" said he.    By reason of this incident the fame of the Philosopher became even  greater than it had been before, and also by reason of it many singular  events were to happen with which you shall duly become acquainted.        CHAPTER IV    IT SO happened that the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora were not  thankful to the Philosopher for having sent Meehawl MacMurrachu to  their field. In stealing Meehawl's property they were quite within their  rights because their bird had undoubtedly been slain by his cat. Not  alone, therefore, was their righteous vengeance nullified, but the crock  of gold which had taken their community many thousands of years to amass  was stolen. A Leprecaun without a pot of gold is like a rose without  perfume, a bird without a wing, or an inside without an outside. They  considered that the Philosopher had treated them badly, that his action  was mischievous and unneighbourly, and that until they were adequately  compensated for their loss both of treasure and dignity, no conditions  other than those of enmity could exist between their people and the  little house in the pine wood. Furthermore, for them the situation was  cruelly complicated. They were unable to organise a direct, personal  hostility against their new enemy, because the Thin Woman of Inis  Magrath would certainly protect her husband. She belonged to the Shee of  Croghan Conghaile, who had relatives in every fairy fort in Ireland, and  were also strongly represented in the forts and duns of their immediate  neighbours. They could, of course, have called an extraordinary meeting  of the Sheogs, Leprecauns, and Cluricauns, and presented their case  with a claim for damages against the Shee of Croghan Conghaile, but  that Clann would assuredly repudiate any liability on the ground that  no member of their fraternity was responsible for the outrage, as it was  the Philosopher, and not the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, who had done  the deed. Notwithstanding this they were unwilling to let the matter  rest, and the fact that justice was out of reach only added fury to  their anger.    One of their number was sent to interview the Thin Woman of Inis  Magrath, and the others concentrated nightly about the dwelling of  Meehawl MacMurrachu in an endeavour to recapture the treasure which  they were quite satisfied was hopeless. They found that Meehawl, who  understood the customs of the Earth Folk very well, had buried the crock  of gold beneath a thorn bush, thereby placing it under the protection of  every fairy in the world--the Leprecauns themselves included, and until  it was removed from this place by human hands they were bound to respect  its hiding-place, and even guarantee its safety with their blood.    They afflicted Meehawl with an extraordinary attack of rheumatism and  his wife with an equally virulent sciatica, but they got no lasting  pleasure from their groans.    The Leprecaun, who had been detailed to visit the Thin Woman of Inis  Magrath, duly arrived at the cottage in the pine wood and made his  complaint. The little man wept as he told the story, and the two  children wept out of sympathy for him. The Thin Woman said she was  desperately grieved by the whole unpleasant transaction, and that  all her sympathies were with Gort na Cloca Mora, but that she must  disassociate herself from any responsibility in the matter as it was her  husband who was the culpable person, and that she had no control over  his mental processes, which, she concluded, was one of the seven curious  things in the world.    As her husband was away in a distant part of the wood nothing further  could be done at that time, so the Leprecaun returned again to his  fellows without any good news, but he promised to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#3)"],[1,"were numerous more or less successful love-poets  of the conventional type writing in                          page xviii  octosyllabics and the inevitable imitators of Dante  with their unreadable allegories in _arte mayor_. The  repository for the short poems of these writers is the  _Cancionero general_ of Hernando de Castillo (1511). It  was reprinted many times throughout the sixteenth  century. Among the writers represented in it one should  distinguish, however, Rodrigo de Cota. His dramatic  _Dialogo entre el amor y un viejo_ has real charm, and  has saved his name from the oblivion to which most of his  fellows have justly been consigned. The bishop Ambrosio  Montesino (_Cancionero_, 1508) was a fervent religious  poet and the precursor of the mystics of fifty years  later.    The political condition of Spain improved immensely in  the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella (1479-1516) and the  country entered upon a period of internal homogeneity and  tranquility which might be expected to foster artistic  production. Such was the case; but literature was not the  first of the arts to reach a highly refined state. The  first half of the sixteenth century is a period of  humanistic study, and the poetical works coming from it  were still tentative. JUAN DEL ENCINA (1469-1533?) is  important in the history of the drama, for his _eglogas,  representaciones_ and _autos_ are practically the first  Spanish dramas not anonymous. As a lyric poet Encina  excels in the light pastoral; he was a musician as well  as a poet, and his bucolic _villancicos_ and _glosas_  in stanzas of six-and eight-syllable lines are daintily  written and express genuine love of nature. The Portuguese  GIL VICENTE (1470-1540?) was a follower of Encina at  first, but a much bigger man. Like most of his compatriots  of the sixteenth century he wrote in both Portuguese and  Castilian, though better in the former tongue. He was  close to the people in his thinking and writing               page xix  and some of the songs contained in his plays reproduce the  truest popular savor.    The intimate connection between Spain and Italy during the  period when the armies of the Emperor Charles V (Charles I  of Spain: reigned 1516-1555) were overrunning the latter  country gave a new stimulus to the imitation of Italian  meters and poets which we have seen existed in a premature  state since the reign of John II. The man who first  achieved real success in the hendecasyllable, combined in  sonnets, octaves, _terza rima_ and blank verse, was Juan  BOSCAN ALMOGAVER (1490?-1542), a Catalan of wealth and  culture. Boscan was handicapped by writing in a tongue  not native to him and by the constant holding of foreign  models before his eyes, and he was not a man of genius;  yet his verse kept to a loftier ideal than had appeared  for a long time and his effort to lift Castilian poetry  from the slough of convention into which it had fallen was  successful. During the rest of the century the impulse  given by Boscan divided Spanish lyrists into two opposing  hosts, the Italianates and those who clung to the native  meters (stanzas of short, chiefly octosyllabic, lines, for  the _arte mayor_ had sunk by its own weight).    The first and greatest of Boscan's disciples was his close  friend GARCILASO DE LA VEGA (1503-1536) who far surpassed  his master. He was a scion of a most noble family, a  favorite of the emperor, and his adventurous career,  passed mostly in Italy, ended in a soldier's death. His  poems, however (_eglogas, canciones_, sonnets, etc.),  take us from real life into the sentimental world of the  Arcadian pastoral. Shepherds discourse of their unrequited  loves and mourn amid surroundings of an idealized Nature.                                                                  page xx  The pure diction, the Vergilian flavor, the classic finish  of these poems made them favorites in Spain from the  first, and their author has always been regarded as a  master.    With Garcilaso begins the golden age of Spanish poetry and  of Spanish literature in general, which may be said to  close in 1681 with the death of Calderon. It was a period  of external greatness, of conquest both in Europe and  beyond the Atlantic, but it contained the germs of future  decay. The strength of the nation was exhausted in  futile warfare, and virile thought was stifled by the  Inquisition, supported by the monarchs. Hence the  luxuriant literature of the time runs in the channels  farthest from underlying social problems; philosophy and  political satire are absent, and the romantic drama, novel  and lyric flourish. But in all external qualities the  poetry written during this period has never been equaled  in Spain. Its polish, color and choiceness of language  have been the admiration and model of later Castilian  poets.    The superficial nature of this literature is exhibited  in the controversy excited by the efforts of Boscan and  Garcilaso to substitute Italian forms for the older  Spanish ones. The discussion dealt with externals; with  meters, not ideas. Both schools delighted in the airy  nothings of the conventional love lyric, and it matters  little at this distance whether they were cast in lines of  eleven or eight syllables.    The contest was warm at the time, however. Sa de Miranda  (1495-1558), the chief exponent of the Italian school in  Portugal, wrote effectively also in Castilian. Gutierre de  Cetina (1518?-1572?) and Fernando de Acuna (1500?-1580?)  are two others who supported the new measures. One whose  example had more influence is Diego Hurtado de                 page xxi  Mendoza (1503-1575), a famous diplomat, humanist and  historian. He entertained his idle moments with verse,  writing cleverly in the old style but turning also toward  the new. His sanction for the latter seems to have proved  decisive.    Cristobal de CASTILLEJO (1490-1556) was the chief defender  of the native Spanish forms. He employed them himself in  light verse with cleverness, clearness and finish, and  also attacked the innovators with all the resources of  a caustic wit. In this patriotic task he was for a time  aided by an organist of the cathedral at Granada, Gregorio  Silvestre (1520-1569), of Portuguese birth. Silvestre,  however, who is noted for the delicacy of his poems in  whatever style, was later attracted by the popularity of  the Italian meters and adopted them.    This literary squabble ended in the most natural way,  namely, in the co-existence of both manners in peace and  harmony. Italian forms were definitively naturalized in  Spain, where they have maintained their place ever since.  Subsequent poets wrote in either style or both as they  felt moved, and no one reproached them. Such was the habit  of Lope de Vega, Gongora, Quevedo and the other great  writers of the seventeenth century.    A Sevillan Italianate was Fernando de HERRERA  (1534?-1597), admirer and annotator of Garcilaso. Although  an ecclesiastic, his poetic genius was more virile than  that of his soldier master. He wrote Petrarchian sonnets  to his platonic lady; but his martial, patriotic spirit  appears in his _canciones_, especially in those on the  battle of Lepanto and on the expedition of D. Sebastian of  Portugal in Africa. In these stirring odes Herrera touches  a sonorous, grandiloquent chord which rouses the              page xxii  reader's enthusiasm and places the writer in the first  rank of Spanish lyrists. He is noteworthy also in that  he made an attempt to create a poetic language by the  rejection of vulgar words and the coinage of new ones.  Others, notably Juan de Mena, had attempted it before, and  Gongora afterward carried it to much greater lengths; but  the idea never succeeded in Castilian to an extent nearly  so great as it did in France, for example; and to-day the  best poetical diction does not differ greatly from good  conversational language.    Beside Herrera stands a totally different spirit, the  Salamancan monk Luis DE LEON (1527-1591). The deep  religious feeling which is one strong trait of Spanish  character has its representatives in Castilian literature  from Berceo down, but Leon was the first to give it fine  artistic expression. The mystic sensation of oneness with  the divine, of aspiration to heavenly joys, breathes in  all his writings. He was also a devoted student of the  classics, and his poems (for which he cared nothing and  which were not published till 1631) show Latin rather than  Italian influence. There is nothing in literature more  pure, more serene, more direct or more polished than  _La vida del campo, Noche serena_ and others of his  compositions.    The other great mystics cared less for literature, either  as a study or an accomplishment. The poems of Saint  Theresa (1515-1582) are few and mostly mediocre. San Juan  de la Cruz, the Ecstatic Doctor (1542-1591), wrote the  most exalted spiritual poems in the language; like all the  mystics, he was strongly attracted by the Song of  Songs which was paraphrased by Pedro Malon de Chaide  (1530-1596?). It is curious to note that the stanza  adopted in the great mystical lyrics is one                  page xxiii  invented by Garcilaso and used in his amatory fifth  _Cancion_. It has the rime-scheme of the Spanish  _quintilla_, but the lines are the Italian eleven-and  seven-syllable (cf. pp. 9-12). Religious poems in more  popular forms are found in the _Romancero espiritual_  (1612) of Jose de Valdivielso, and in Lope de Vega's  _Rimas sacras_ (1614) and _Romancero espiritual_ (1622).    There were numerous secular disciples of Garcilaso at  about the same period. The names most deserving mention  are those of Francisco de la Torre (d. 1594?), Luis  Barahona de Soto (1535?-1595) and Francisco de Figueroa  (1536?-1620), all of whom wrote creditably and sometimes  with distinction in the Italian forms.
