These rules for regulating the social actions of men, are called  laws. _Law_, in a general sense, is a rule of action, and is applied to  all kinds of action. But in its limited and proper sense, it denotes the  rules of human action prescribing what men are to do, and forbidding  what they are not to do.    Sec.7. We have seen that man is fitted for society, and that laws are  necessary to govern the conduct of men in the social state. We see also  that mankind are fitted by nature for government and laws. Man is also a  moral being. The word _moral_ has various significations. Sometimes it  means only virtuous, or just; as, a moral man; that is, a man of moral  character, or who lives a moral life; by which is meant that the conduct  of the man is just and right.    Sec.8. But in a wider sense, the word moral relates to the social actions  of men, both right and wrong. Thus, in speaking of the character of a  man, we say, his morals are good, or his morals are bad. And of an  action, we say, it is morally right, or it is morally wrong. Man's  having a moral nature implies that he has a sense of right and wrong, or  at least the power or faculty of acquiring it; and, being a moral agent,  he is accountable for his actions.    Sec.9. Thus we have seen that men are social, reasonable, and moral beings.  They have power to discern their own wants and the wants of their fellow  men; to perceive what is right and what is wrong; and to know that they  ought to do what is right and to forbear to do what is wrong. Their  reason enables them to understand the meaning of laws, and to discover  what laws are necessary to regulate the social actions of men. Hence we  conclude that they are fitted and designed for society, and for  government and law.    Sec.10. The youngest reader probably knows, that in speaking of society, we  do not refer to any of those associations usually called societies, but  to _civil_ society, composed of the people of a state or nation. A  _nation_, or _state_, is a large number of persons united under some  form of government; as, the French nation; the British nation; or the  state of New-York; the state of Virginia. Sometimes it signifies the  ruling or governing power of a state or nation, as, the state has  provided for educating its citizens, and for supporting the poor.    Sec.11. The object of the people in forming a state association, or, as is  sometimes said, of entering into civil society, is to promote their  mutual safety and happiness. In uniting for this purpose, they agree to  be governed by certain established rules and principles; and the  governing of the people of a state or nation according to these rules,  is called _civil government_. The word _government_ also signifies the  rules and principles themselves by which the people are governed; and  sometimes the persons who administer the government--that is those who  make the laws of a state and carry them into effect--are called _the  government_.          Chapter II.    Rights and Liberty, defined.        Sec.1. We have spoken of the rights of men, and of laws as designed to  secure to men the free enjoyment of their rights. But a more particular  definition of rights and laws will be useful to young persons just  commencing the study of civil government.    Sec.2. A _right_ means ownership, or the just claim or lawful title which a  person has to anything. What we have acquired by honest labor, or other  lawful means, is rightfully our own; and we are justly entitled to the  free use and enjoyment of it. We have a right also to be free in our  actions. We may go where we please, and do what ever we think necessary  for our own safety and happiness; provided we do not trespass upon the  rights of others; for it must be remembered that others have the same  rights as ourselves.    Sec.3. The rights here mentioned are _natural_ rights. They are so called  because they are ours by nature or by birth; and they can not be justly  taken from us or alienated. Hence they are also called _inalienable_. We  may, however, forfeit them by some offense or crime. If, for example, a  man is fined for breaking a law, he loses his right to the money he is  obliged to pay. By stealing, he forfeits his liberty, and may be justly  imprisoned. By committing murder, he forfeits his right to life, and may  be hanged.    Sec.4. Rights are also called personal, political, civil, and religious.  _Personal rights_, or the _rights of persons_, are rights belonging to  persons as individuals, and consist of the right of _personal security_,  or the right to be secure from injury to our bodies, or persons, or our  good names; the right of _personal liberty_, or the liberty of moving,  acting, or speaking without unjust restraint; and the _right of  property_, or the right to acquire and enjoy property. The terms  _rights of person_ and _rights of persons_, or _personal rights_, have  not the same meaning. The rights of person, as the term is generally  used, does not include the right of property; personal rights include  both the right of property and the rights of person.    Sec.5. _Political rights_ are those which belong to the people in their  political capacity. The word _political_, in a general sense, relates to  government. The whole body of the people united under one government, is  called the political body, or body politic. The right of the people to  choose and establish for themselves a form of government, or  constitution, and the right to elect persons to make and execute the  laws, are political rights. The right of voting at elections is  therefore a political right.    Sec.6. _Civil rights_ are those which are secured to the citizens by the  laws of the state. Some make no distinction between civil rights and  political rights. In a proper sense--that in which the terms are here  used--there is this difference: political rights are those secured by  the political or fundamental law, called the constitution; civil rights  are more properly those which are secured by the civil or municipal  laws. The difference will more clearly appear from the definition  elsewhere given of the political and civil laws. (Chap. III. Sec.5, 6.)    Sec.7. _Religious rights_ consist in the right of a man to make known and  maintain his religious opinions, and to worship God in that way and  manner which he believes in his conscience to be most acceptable to his  Maker. This right is called also the _right of conscience_. But in  exercising this right, a man may not abuse it by violating the rights of  others, or disturbing the peace and order of society.    Sec.8. Now, although human rights are thus divided into classes and  differently defined, they are all natural rights. It is generally held  in this country as a truth, that \"all men are created equal;\" that is,  born with the same rights. And if men, as social and moral beings, are  fitted by _nature_ and designed for government and laws, we conclude  that their political, civil, and religious rights, and all other rights  to which they are entitled by the law of nature, are natural rights.    Sec.9. _Liberty_ is the being free to exercise and enjoy our rights, and is  called natural, political, civil, or religious, according to the  particular class of rights referred to. Thus the exercise of rights  guarantied by the constitution or political law, is called political  liberty. The free enjoyment of rights secured by the civil or municipal  laws, is called civil liberty. And freedom of religious opinion and  worship is called religious liberty.    Sec.10. Hence liberty itself is a natural right. The words _right_ and  _liberty_, however, have not the same meaning. We may have a right to a  thing when we have not the liberty of using it. John has a pencil which  is justly his own; but James takes it from him by force. John's liberty  to enjoy the use of his pencil is lost, but his right to it remains.  James has no right to the use of the pencil, though he enjoys the use of  it.    Sec.11. This example serves also to explain further the use of the  different terms applied to rights and liberty. John's right to his  pencil, being guarantied to him by the laws of civil society, is a  _civil_ right. It is with equal propriety called a _natural_ right,  because, by the law of nature, he has a right to the use of his pencil.          Chapter III.    Laws, defined.        Sec.1. Law has been briefly defined. (Chap. 1. Sec.6.) As in the case of  rights and liberty, laws are distinguished by different names; as, the  law of nature, or natural law; the moral law; the law of revelation, or  revealed law; the political law; the civil or municipal law.    Sec.2. The _law of nature_, is of the highest possible authority, being  established by the supreme Lawgiver himself. It is called the law of  nature, because it is right in itself--right in the nature of things,  and ought to be obeyed, though no positive command had ever been given  to men. It is a perfect rule of right for all moral and social beings.  It is that eternal rule of right to which God himself conforms.    Sec.3. The law of nature, as a rule of human action, arises out of man's  relation to his Maker and to his fellow men. As a creature, he must be  subject to the laws of his Creator, on whom he is dependent. He is also  in a measure dependent upon his fellow beings. All being created equal,  each is bound by the principles of natural justice to render to others  that assistance which is necessary to make them as happy as himself, or  which they justly owe to him in return.    Sec.4. The _moral law_ is that which prescribes to men their duties to God  and to each other. As a rule of human conduct therefore, it corresponds  exactly to the law of nature. The moral law is briefly expressed in the  decalogue or ten commandments, and is still more briefly summed up in  the two great commandments, to love God with all our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#3)"],[1,"black, but an ancient shooting-jacket, khaki  breeches and brown gaiters, looking every inch of him the old soldier  that he was.    \"Well, Coates?\" said I.    He cleared his throat.    \"There are footprints in the radish-beds, sir,\" he reported.    \"Footprints?\"    \"Yes, sir. Very deep. As though some one had jumped over the hedge and  landed there.\"    \"Jumped over the hedge!\" I exclaimed. \"That would be a considerable  jump, Coates, from the road.\"    \"It would, sir. Maybe she scrambled up.\"    \"She?\"    Coates cleared his throat again.    \"There are three sets of prints in all. First a very deep one where  the party had landed, then another broken up like, where she had  turned round, and the third set with the heel-marks very deep where  she had sprung back over the hedge.\"    _\"She?\"_ I shouted.    \"The prints, sir,\" resumed Coates, unmoved, \"are those of a lady's  high-heeled shoes.\"    I sat bolt upright in bed, staring at the man and scarcely able to  credit my senses. Words failed me. Whereupon:    \"Will you have tea or coffee for breakfast?\" inquired Coates.    \"Tea or coffee be damned, Coates!\" I cried. \"I'm going out to look at  those footprints! If you had seen what I saw last night, even your old  mahogany countenance would relax for once, I assure you.\"    \"Indeed, sir,\" said Coates; \"did you see the lady, then?\"    \"Lady!\" I exclaimed, tumbling out of bed. \"If the eyes that looked at  me last night belonged to a 'lady' either I am mad or the 'lady' is of  another world.\"    I pulled on a bath-robe and hurried out into the garden, Coates  showing me the spot where he had found the mysterious foot-prints. A  very brief examination sufficed to convince me that his account had  been correct. Some one wearing high-heeled shoes clearly enough had  stood there at some time whilst the soil was quite wet; and as no  track led to or from the marks, Coates' conclusion that the person who  had made them must have come over the hedge was the only feasible one.  I turned to him in amazement, but recognizing in time the wildly  fantastic nature of the sight which I had seen in the night, I  refrained from speaking of the blazing eyes and made my way to the  bathroom wondering if some chance reflection might not have deceived  me and the presence of a woman's footmarks at the same spot be no  more than a singular coincidence. Even so the mystery of their  presence there remained unexplained.    My thoughts were diverted from a trend of profitless conjecture when  shortly after breakfast time my 'phone bell rang. It was the editor of  the _Planet_, to whom I had been indebted for a number of special  commissions--including my fascinating quest of the Giant Gnu, which,  generally supposed to be extinct, was reported by certain natives and  others to survive in a remote corner of the Dark Continent.    Readers of the _Planet_ will remember that although I failed to  discover the Gnu I came upon a number of notable things on my journey  through the almost unexplored country about the head-waters of the  Niger.    \"A most extraordinary case has cropped up,\" he said, \"quite in your  line, I think, Addison. Evidently a murder, and the circumstances seem  to be most dramatic and unusual. I should be glad if you would take it  up.\"    I inquired without much enthusiasm for details. Criminology was one of  my hobbies, and in several instances I had traced cases of alleged  haunting and other supposedly supernatural happenings to a criminal  source; but the ordinary sordid murder did not interest me.    \"The body of Sir Marcus Coverly has been found in a crate!\" explained  my friend. \"The crate was being lowered into the hold of the S.S.  _Oritoga_ at the West India Docks. It had been delivered by a  conveyance specially hired for the purpose apparently, as the  _Oritoga_ is due to sail in an hour. There are all sorts of curious  details but these you can learn for yourself. Don't trouble to call at  the office; proceed straight to the dock.\"    \"Right!\" I said shortly. \"I'll start immediately.\"    And this sudden decision had been brought about by the mention of the  victim's name. Indeed, as I replaced the receiver on the hook I  observed that my hand was shaking and I have little doubt that I had  grown pale.    In the first place, then, let me confess that my retirement to the odd  little retreat which at this time was my home, and my absorption in  the obscure studies to which I have referred were not so much due to  any natural liking for the life of a recluse as to the shattering of  certain matrimonial designs. I had learned of the wreck of my hopes  upon reading a press paragraph which announced the engagement of  Isobel Merlin to Eric Coverly. And it was as much to conceal my  disappointment from the world as for any better reason that I had  slunk into retirement; for if I am slow to come to a decision in such  a matter, once come to, it is of no light moment.    Yet although I had breathed no word of my lost dreams to Isobel but  had congratulated her with the rest, often and bitterly I had cursed  myself for a sluggard. Too late I had learned that she had but awaited  a word from me; and I had gone off to Mesopotamia, leaving that word  unspoken. During my absence Coverly had won the prize which I had  thrown away. He was heir to the title, for his cousin, Sir Marcus,  was unmarried. Now here, a bolt from the blue, came the news of his  cousin's death!    It can well be imagined with what intense excitement I hurried to the  docks. All other plans abandoned, Coates, arrayed in his neat blue  uniform, ran the Rover round from the garage, and ere long we were  jolting along the hideously uneven Commercial Road, East, dodging  traction-engines drawing strings of lorries, and continually meeting  delay in the form of those breakdowns which are of hourly occurrence  in this congested but rugged highway.    In the West India Dock Road the way became slightly more open, but  when at last I alighted and entered the dock gates I recognized that  every newspaper and news agency in the kingdom was apparently  represented. Jones, of the _Gleaner_, was coming out as I went in,  and:    \"Hello, Addison!\" he cried, \"this is quite in your line! It's as mad  as 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"    I did not delay, however, but hurried on in the direction of a dock  building, at the door of which was gathered a heterogeneous group  comprising newspaper men, dock officials, police and others who were  unclassifiable. Half a dozen acquaintances greeted me as I came up,  and I saw that the door was closed and that a constable stood on duty  before it.    \"I call it damned impudence, Addison!\" exclaimed one pressman. \"The  dock people are refusing everybody information until Inspector  Somebody-or-Other arrives from New Scotland Yard. I should think he  has stopped on the way to get his lunch.\"    The speaker glanced impatiently at his watch and I went to speak to  the man on duty.    \"You have orders to admit no one, constable?\" I asked.    \"That's so, sir,\" he replied. \"We're waiting for Detective-Inspector  Gatton, who has been put in charge of the case.\"    \"Ah! Gatton,\" I muttered, and, stepping aside from the expectant  group, I filled and lighted my pipe, convinced that anything to be  learned I should learn from Inspector Gatton, for he and I were old  friends, having been mutually concerned in several interesting cases.    A few minutes later the Inspector arrived--a thick-set, clean-shaven,  very bronzed man, his dark hair streaked with gray, and with all the  appearance of a retired naval officer, in his well-cut blue serge suit  and soft felt hat; a very reserved man whose innocent-looking blue  eyes gave him that frank and open expression which is more often  associated with a seaman than with a detective. He nodded to several  acquaintances in the group, and then, observing me where I stood, came  over and shook hands.    \"Open the door, constable,\" he ordered quietly.    The constable produced a key and unlocked the door of the small stone  building. Immediately there was a forward movement of the whole  waiting group, but:    \"If you please, gentlemen,\" said Gatton, raising his hand. \"I must  make my examination first; and Mr. Addison,\" he added, seeing the  resentment written upon the faces of my disappointed confreres, \"has  special information which I am going to ask him to place at my  disposal.\"    The constable stood aside and I followed Inspector Gatton into the  stone shed.    \"Lock the door again, constable,\" he ordered; \"no one is to be  admitted.\"    Thereupon I looked about me, and the scene which I beheld was so  strange and gruesome that its every detail remains imprinted upon my  memory.    The building then was lighted by four barred windows set so high in  the walls that no one could look in from the outside. Blazing sunlight  poured in at the two southerly windows and drew a sharp black pattern  of the bars across the paved floor. Kneeling beside a stretcher, fully  in this path of light, so that he presented a curious striped  appearance, was a man who presently proved to be the divisional  surgeon, and two paces beyond stood a police inspector who was engaged  at the moment of our entrance in making entries in his note-book.    On the stretcher, so covered up that only his face was visible, lay  one whom at first I failed to recognize, for the horribly contorted  features presented a kind of mottled green appearance utterly  indescribable.    Stifling an exclamation of horror, I stared and stared at that ghastly  face, then:    \"My God!\" I muttered. \"Yes! it _is_ Sir Marcus!\"    The surgeon stood up and the inspector advanced to meet Gatton, but my  horrified gaze had strayed from the stretcher to a badly damaged and  splintered packing-case, which was the only other object in the  otherwise empty shed. At this I stared as much aghast as I had stared  at the dead man.    The iron bands were broken and "]]]
