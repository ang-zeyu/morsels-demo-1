So the sun sank low behind the Little House, and the shadow of the  tall Blue-gum began to creep down the mountain and get longer and  longer.    Just as it was growing dark, the big Blue-gum said Suddenly, \"It  certainly looks more like rain than ever. The heavy clouds have been  gathering all day, and we shall get it properly to-night.\"    But the rain did not come that night, nor the next day, nor for two  days and nights. And all this while the Little Red House and the Big  Blue-gum remained silent and miserable--one through loneliness, the  other through white-ants.    But on the evening of the third day the big Blue-gum said, \"The rain  will come to-night for certain. I know by the feel of the air.\"    \"Let it come!\" said the Little Red House. \"I don't care. I couldn't  be more miserable than I am.\"    Just as he said that, one great rain-drop fell right on the middle  of his roof--Plop!    \"It's coming already,\" cried the Blue-gum, \"and it's going to pour.\"    Then three more big drops fell--Plop! Plop! Plop!    \"I have never in my life seen such big rain-drops,\" said the Blue-gum.  \"I've lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for--\"    But--Crash! came rain before he could finish; and in two seconds  everything was sopping wet. The noise of it was deafening,    \"Why, it's a cloud-burst!\" shouted the Blue-gum. \"Half of my leaves  have been stripped off already.\" Then he peered through the rain and  the dark to see how the Little Red House was taking it. \"Why, what's  the matter with your face?\" he cried. \"You look awful.\"    \"I'm crying!\" sobbed the Little Red House. \"That's all--just crying.  \"Can't you see the tears?\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the Blue-gum. \"Those are not tears. It's just the  rain-water running off your window-sills.\"    \"I tell you I'm crying!\" wailed the Little Red House. \"I'm crying  bitterly. I should know, shouldn't I? I'm shivering and crying  because I'm cold and lonely and miserable.\"    \"Oh, very well,\" agreed the Blue-gum. \"You are crying. But if this  rain doesn't stop soon, you'll cry the front path away. It certainly  is wet.\"    Very late that night the rain eased a little and then stopped  altogether. The tears ceased to run from the eyes of the Little  Red House, and they now came only in drops, slower and slower, falling  into the great pool by the front door.    \"It's a hard world!\" sobbed the Little Red House, squeezing out  another tear.    \"Listen!\" cried the Big Blue-gum. \"Do you hear THAT?\"    From far away on the distant ranges came a dull, moaning sound. As  they listened it grew louder, and right in the middle of of it came  another sound--Thump!    \"That's wind,\" said the Blue-gum; \"and a big wind, too.\"    \"Let it come!\" sighed the Little Red House. \"I couldn't be more  miserable than I am.\"    As he spoke, the moaning grew louder, and there were three or four  quite big thumps one after another.    \"What's that thumping?\" asked the little House.    \"Those are my poor brothers,\" answered the big Blue-gum very sadly,  \"Those are trees going down before the big wind. The birds were  bringing me messages from those poor fellows quite lately; and now I  shall never hear from them again. It's very sad.\"    \"I never thought the wind could blow down big trees,\" said the Little  House.    \"No tree knows when his time will come,\" the big Blue-gum answered  gravely. \"I've had some very narrow escapes in my time, as tree and  sapling on this mountain.\"    The Little Red House was very quiet and thoughtful for a long time  after that. Then he asked suddenly, \"Which way do you think you would  fall if you did fall?\"    But the big Blue-gum said that he couldn't tell. It depended on the  wind, and he might fall any way.    \"Not on me!\" cried the Little House.    The Blue-gum said that he didn't know; but he hoped not.    \"If you DID fall on me,\" said the Little Red House, \"I suppose it  would hurt me.\"    The Blue-gum said it certainly would, and there would be very little  left but splinters and glass.    \"Then don't! Please don't,\" yelled the Little Red House.    But before they could say another word the great wind struck them with  a roar. It tossed the roses about so that the eyebrows of the Little  House seemed to be twitching horribly; and it swayed the big Blue-gum  this way and that till he appeared to be fighting for his very life.  It picked up the fallen leaves and twigs, and even small stones, and  hurled them down the mountain in a cloud.    In the midst of all the uproar the Little House heard the Blue-gum  calling to him.    \"As long as I've lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling,\" he  shouted, \"I've never known such a wind. I'm not so young as I used to  be, and I fear that my end has come.\"    \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" implored the Little Red House. \"Don't let  him blow you down. I should be so sorry to lose you, What are you  grunting for?\"    \"I'm not grunting,\" answered the Blue-gym in a pained voice. \"Those  are my roots giving way, one by one. I can't stand much more of this.  Look out!\"    The Little Red House looked up, and what he saw terrified him. The  big Blue-gum, in the clutch of the wind, was bent right over him,  so that the top branches seemed to be just above his roof; and the  great tree appeared to be falling, falling, helplessly.    \"Don't fall on me!\" shrieked the Little Red House. \"Oh, don't fall  on me; because, if you do, you know you'll squash me! I don't want  to be squashed!\"    But the big Blue-gum said, \"There is just one little root holding  now. If that gives way we are both done for.\"    \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" shrieked the Little Red House.    Then slowly, very slowly, the big Blue-gum began to straighten up  again, away from the Little Red House.    \"I have stood upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a  hundred years,\" he said when he had recovered; \"but if it blows like  that again, it is the end of me.\"    But it did not blow like that again; though the wind howled and  shrieked all that day as if it was very angry and disappointed that  it could not blow down the big Blue-gum.    Then, towards evening, the wind fell; the heavy clouds went away  beyond the edge of the sky, and all became very calm and peaceful.    The birds came from their hiding places and sat in the branches of  the Blue-gum and chattered away to him, until he began to feel quite  cheerful once more, in spite of his trouble. And when a certain  little Tree-creeper--a very wise bird--came and had a long, serious  talk with the Blue-gum, he became very much interested indeed and  quite happy.    But the Little Red House was miserable still; and the beauty of  the evening didn't cheer him up one bit.    \"Ah, well,\" said the Blue-gum, when the darkness came to the mountain,  \"I am going to have a good sleep tonight. I'm a match still for old  Daddy Wind, in spite of all his noise and bluster. And there are ways  of dealing with white-ants, too. I've lived upon this mountain, tree  and sapling, for--\"    But as he was talking he fell fast asleep.    The Little Red House did not sleep. How could he, with his eyes wide  open? So he just stood there all night staring before him, lonely and  wretched. And when an owl came and sat in the tree and began to call,  \"Mopoke,\" the Little Red House told him rudely to stop his silly noise  and clear out. That will just show you how very miserable he was.    It was quite late next morning when the Blue-gum awoke. He stretched  his big limbs, and began to wonder what he might say to comfort the  Little Red House. But when the Blue-gum looked down, he saw that the  Little Red House was smiling all over his face.    \"Well, now!\" cried the big Blue-gum cheerfully. \"That's the kind of  face I like to see in the morning! So you've decided to be sensible  and forget your loneliness?\"    But the Little Red House didn't say a word. He just went on smiling.    Then the big Blue-gum began to get uneasy.    \"I do hope your troubles haven't turned you silly,\" he said. \"You  haven't lost your senses, have you?\"    \"I?\" cried the Little Red House. \"Why, look down the valley! See  who's coming!\"    Down, far down, the valley, just coming through the white gate, were  two figures that looked like tiny specks. And much nearer was another  speck, which was certainly a little dog.    \"It's them--I mean those are they!\" shouted the Little Red House  happily. \"Sym and Emily Ann! And here comes our little dog.\"    \"Well, you certainly have sharp eyes,\" replied the Blue-gum. \"But I  suppose I'm getting old--over a hundred years, you know.\"    The two figures were through the white gate now, and had crossed the  red road out on to the stony flat--getting bigger and bigger as they  came; and the smile on the Little Red House seemed to grow broader  and broader. On they came, under the tree-ferns, up by the big rocks,  past the sign-post. And now the Little Red House could hear Sym  singing his Tinker's song.    But it was not quite the same song this time:    \"Kettles and pans! Ho, kettles and pans!  Where's there a home like the tinkering man's?  Weary of wandering, home is the place--  The Little Red House with the smile on his face--  Weary and hungry, my Emily Ann.  Then put on the kettle! Ho, put on the pan!\"    \"Now THAT is the sort of song I DO like,\" said the Little Red House,  as he watched them coming up the mountain.    On they came, growing bigger and bigger--through the sliprails, across  the potato paddock, over the bridge, round by the bracken-patch, past  the black stump, through the gate, and here they were, right at the  front door.    \"Oh, I AM glad to be home again,\" cried Emily Ann. \"And do look at the  Little House. He seems to be smiling.\"    \"Of course he is smiling,\" answered Sym; \"but he has a very dirty face.\"    \"The storm did that,\" said Emily Ann. \"Now hurry and get the fire  alight, and I'll put the kettle on.\" And they went inside laughing  and singing, while the little dog flew round the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#3)"],[1,"trees.  You will find it on the mountain  ash, and sometimes on the currant bushes,\" he answered.    The colonel asked him if he would recommend spraying to get rid of the  pests, and was advised to begin immediately, using tobacco water or  whale-oil soap.    \"By the way,\" said the colonel, \"there is a beetle attacking my shade  trees.  They are ruining that fine row of elms in front of the lawn.\"    \"It is undoubtedly the _melolontha vulgaris_,\" said the professor.  I  designate him in this way because he used such large words we did not  understand.  My mother told us that she was positive he was president  of a college.  \"The _melolontha vulgaris_ is the most destructive of  beetles, but the larvae are still more injurious.  They do incalculable  damage to the farmer.  Fortunately enormous numbers of these grubs are  eaten by the birds.\"    \"Unfortunately the birds are not so numerous as they used to be.  They  are being destroyed so rapidly, more's the pity!  These grounds and  woods yonder were formerly alive with birds of all kinds.  Flocks of  the purple grakle used to follow the plow and eat up the worms at a  great rate.  You are familiar with their habits?  You know they are  most devoted parents.  I have often watched them feeding their young.  The little ones have such astonishingly good appetites that it keeps  the old folks busy to supply them with enough to eat.  They work like  beavers as long as daylight lasts, going to and from the fields  carrying on each return trip a fat grub or a toothsome grasshopper.\"    \"I am a great lover of birds,\" returned the professor enthusiastically,  \"and I find them very interesting subjects of study.  By the way, I was  reading the other day a little incident connected with one of America's  great men which impressed me deeply.  The story goes that he was one  day walking in company with some noted statesmen, busily engaged in  conversation.  But he was not too much occupied to notice that a young  bird had fallen from its nest near the path where they were walking.  He stopped short and crossing over to where the bird was lying,  tenderly picked it up and put it back into its nest.  There was a  gentleman of a noble nature!  No wonder that man was a leader and a  liberator!\"    \"Who was he?\"    \"The grand, the great Abraham Lincoln,\" responded the professor  impressively.    \"Well, he'd be the very one to do just such a kind deed as that,\" was  the colonel's hearty response.  \"No man ever lived who had a bigger,  more merciful heart than 'Honest Abe.'\"    For myself I did not know who Abraham Lincoln was.  I had never heard  the name before, but I was quite sure from the proud tone of the  professor's voice that he was a distinguished man, as I was equally  sure from the story of his pity for the helpless bird, that he was a  good man.    \"You mentioned the industry of the grakle a moment ago,\" resumed the  professor.  \"Do you know that the redwing is equally as useful, and  besides he is a delightful singer?      \"The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee.    \"Do you remember that line, colonel?\" and the professor softly whistled  a strain in imitation of a bird's note.  \"The services of our little  brothers of the air are exceedingly valuable to the horticulturist.  And think of the damage done to arboriculture by the woodborers alone  were it not for the help given by the birds.  Did you ever notice those  borers at work, colonel?  Some writer has well described them as  animated gimlets.  They just stick their pointed heads into the bark  and turn their bodies around and around and out pours a little stream  of sawdust.  The birds would pick off such pests fast enough if people  would only give them a chance and not scare them off with shotguns.\"    \"Yes, the birds earn their way, there is no denying it, and he is a  very stupid farmer who begrudges them the little corn and wheat they  take from the fields.  The account is more than balanced by the good  they do.\"  Then the conversation ceased, for the colonel and his friend  moved off to inspect the quince bushes.    Pleased by the praises they had bestowed on us for our efforts in  cleaning the fruit trees and cornfields of injurious insects, I went to  work with new vigor to get out some bugs for my luncheon, and was thus  pleasantly employed when a sharp twitter from my mother attracted my  attention.    \"Look, children!\" she exclaimed.  \"Here come our young ladies with some  company from the city.  Be careful to notice what they have on their  heads and then tell me what you think of our sweet, pretty ladies.\"    One of my brothers was swaying lightly on a little swing below me.  I  flew down hastily and placed myself on the next bough, where I could  also get a good view of the ladies as they strolled toward us.  They  were in a very merry mood and each one seemed striving to say something  more arousing than her companions.  Miss Dorothy led the way, her arm  linked in that of one of the stranger guests.  Then followed the others  with Miss Katie and Marian hand in hand in the rear.  They were all  very handsomely dressed, and having just returned from a drive had not  yet removed their hats.    As they came under the tree where we were perched, which was a favorite  spot with Miss Katie, they halted for some time and consequently I had  an excellent opportunity to look, as my mother had bidden me.    And what did I see?    I saw six ladies' hats trimmed with dead birds.  Fastened on sidewise,  head downward, on one was a magnificent scarlet tanager, his body half  concealed by folds of tulle, his fixed eye staring into vacancy.  On  another was the head and breast of a beautiful yellow-hammer; it was  surmounted by the tall sweeping plumes of the egret, which this bird  produces only at breeding time.  Oh, how much joy and beauty the world  had lost by that cruel deed!  A third hat had two song sparrows  imprisoned in meshes of star-studded lace.  Their blithesome carol had  been rudely silenced, their cheer to the world cut short, simply that  they might be used for hat trimming.  Of the remaining ones some were  as yet unknown to me, but my mother, who had an extensive acquaintance  with foreign birds, said that in that strange murderous mixture of  millinery, far-away Australia had furnished the filmy feathers of the  lyre bird which swept upward from a knot of ribbons, and that the  forests of Germany had contributed the pretty green linnet.  Dove's  wings and the rosy breast of the grosbeak completed the barbarous  display.    How my heart sickened as I gazed at these pleasant, refined,  soft-voiced women flaunting the trophies of their cruelty in the  beautiful sunlight.    Had they no compassion for the feathered mother who had been robbed of  her young for the sake of a hat?    \"Oh, how can they do such dreadful, such wicked things!\" I moaned.  My  mother heard my lament and signaled for us to come up where she was  perching.    \"You see now who are our worst enemies,\" said she.  \"The cat preys on  us to satisfy his bodily hunger, but women have no such excuse.  We are  not slaughtered to sustain their lives but to minister to their vanity.  For years the women of Christian lands have waged their unholy war  against us.  We have been driven from our old haunts and forced to seek  new places.  We have been shot down by thousands every season until now  many species are destroyed from the face of the earth.  There is no  security for us in any place.  The hunter with his gun penetrates into  the deepest forests, he perils his life in scaling the most dangerous  cliffs, he wades through bog and marsh and mud and tracks us to our  feeding grounds to surprise us with the deadly shot, and kills the  mother hovering over the nest of her helpless offspring with as little  compunction as if she were a poisonous reptile instead of a melodious  joy-giver.  And all this horrible slaughter is for women.\"    I grew feverish with excitement at this terrible arraignment of the  \"gentler sex.\"    \"But why are they so cruel?  Why do they do this wicked thing?\" I asked.    \"For the sake of Fashion,\" said my mother.    \"Fashion, what is that?\"    My mother was very patient with me, so when I asked questions she did  not put me off by telling me she didn't know, or advise me to fly away  and play, or tell me she was busy and couldn't be bothered just then,  therefore she now took pains to make me understand.    \"You ask me what is Fashion,\" she began.  \"Well, Fashion is an exacting  ruler, a great, tyrannical god who has many, many worshipers, and these  he rules with an iron hand.  His followers cannot be induced to do  anything contrary to his wishes.  He sits on a high throne from which  he dictates to his slaves what they must do.  Often they do the most  outrageous things, not because they like to, but because he demands it.  He is constantly laying down new laws for their guidance, and some of  these laws are so unreasonable and absurd that a part of his followers  frequently threaten to rebel.  They do not hold out against him long,  for he manages to make it quite unpleasant for those who disobey him or  refuse to come under his yoke.\"    \"Has he any men slaves?\" asked my brother.    \"Yes, he has some slaves among men, but the larger number of those who  wear his most galling fetters are women.  If he but crooks his little  finger these bond-women rush pell-mell in the direction he points.  They are thus keen to do his bidding, because each woman who is the  first to carry out his rules in her own particular town or neighborhood  acquires great distinction in the eyes of the other worshipers.\"    \"His slaves are nearly always rich women, aren't they?\" asked my  brother.    \"By no means.  Many of them are poor working women who have to labor  hard for a living.  But they will rob themselves of necessities and  needed rest to get the means to follow his demands.  Often it takes  them a long time to do"]]]
