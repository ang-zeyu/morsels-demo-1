His accomplishment then is no more than a promise--a  promise which finds its realization in and by life itself. Yet Americans  have the brains as well as the spiritual endowment necessary to  understand and appreciate beauty in a high degree. They can already  point with pride to violinists who emphatically deserve to be called  artists, and another quarter-century of artistic striving may well bring  them into the front rank of violinistic achievement!\"                                              II                                     LEOPOLD AUER                             A METHOD WITHOUT SECRETS      When that celebrated laboratory of budding musical genius, the Petrograd  Conservatory, closed its doors indefinitely owing to the disturbed  political conditions of Russia, the famous violinist and teacher  Professor Leopold Auer decided to pay the visit to the United States  which had so repeatedly been urged on him by his friends and pupils. His  fame, owing to such heralds as Efrem Zimbalist, Mischa Elman, Kathleen  Parlow, Eddy Brown, Francis MacMillan, and more recently Sascha Heifetz,  Toscha Seidel, and Max Rosen, had long since preceded him; and the  reception accorded him in this country, as a soloist and one of the  greatest exponents and teachers of his instrument, has been one justly  due to his authority and preeminence.    It was not easy to have a heart-to-heart talk with the Master anent his  art, since every minute of his time was precious. Yet ushered into  his presence, the writer discovered that he had laid aside for the  moment other preoccupations, and was amiably responsive to all  questions, once their object had been disclosed. Naturally, the first  and burning question in the case of so celebrated a pedagogue was: \"How  do you form such wonderful artists? What is the secret of your method?\"               [Illustration: LEOPOLD AUER, with hand-written note]                               A METHOD WITHOUT SECRETS    \"I know,\" said Professor Auer, \"that there is a theory somewhat to the  effect that I make a few magic passes with the bow by way of  illustration and--_presto_--you have a Zimbalist or a Heifetz! But the  truth is I have no method--unless you want to call purely natural lines  of development, based on natural principles, a method--and so, of  course, there is no secret about my teaching. The one great point I lay  stress on in teaching is never to kill the individuality of my various  pupils. Each pupil has his own inborn aptitudes, his own personal  qualities as regards tone and interpretation. I always have made an  individual study of each pupil, and given each pupil individual  treatment. And always, always I have encouraged them to develop freely  in their own way as regards inspiration and ideals, so long as this was  not contrary to esthetic principles and those of my art. My idea has  always been to help bring out what nature has already given, rather than  to use dogma to force a student's natural inclinations into channels I  myself might prefer. And another great principle in my teaching, one  which is productive of results, is to demand as much as possible of the  pupil. Then he will give you something!    \"Of course the whole subject of violin teaching is one that I look at  from the standpoint of the teacher who tries to make what is already  excellent perfect from the musical and artistic standpoint. I insist on  a perfected technical development in every pupil who comes to me. Art  begins where technic ends. There can be no real art development before  one's technic is firmly established. And a great deal of technical work  has to be done before the great works of violin literature, the sonatas  and concertos, may be approached. In Petrograd my own assistants, who  were familiar with my ideas, prepared my pupils for me. And in my own  experience I have found that one cannot teach by word, by the spoken  explanation, alone. If I have a point to make I explain it; but if my  explanation fails to explain I take my violin and bow, and clear up the  matter beyond any doubt. The word lives, it is true, but often the word  must be materialized by action so that its meaning is clear. There are  always things which the pupil must be shown literally, though  explanation should always supplement illustration. I studied with  Joachim as a boy of sixteen--it was before 1866, when there was still a  kingdom of Hanover in existence--and Joachim always illustrated his  meaning with bow and fiddle. But he never explained the technical side  of what he illustrated. Those more advanced understood without verbal  comment; yet there were some who did not.    \"As regards the theory that you can tell who a violinist's teacher is by  the way in which he plays, I do not believe in it. I do not believe that  you can tell an Auer pupil by the manner in which he plays. And I am  proud of it since it shows that my pupils have profited by my  encouragement of individual development, and that they become genuine  artists, each with a personality of his own, instead of violinistic  automats, all bearing a marked family resemblance.\"    Questioned as to how his various pupils reflected different phases of  his teaching ideals, Professor Auer mentioned that he had long since  given over passing final decisions on his pupils. \"I could express no  such opinions without unconsciously implying comparisons. And so few  comparisons really compare! Then, too, mine would be merely an  individual opinion. Therefore, as has been my custom for years, I will  continue to leave any ultimate decisions regarding my pupils' playing to  the public and the press.\"                                  HOURS OF PRACTICE    \"How long should the advanced pupil practice?\" Professor Auer was asked.  \"The right kind of practice is not a matter of hours,\" he replied.  \"Practice should represent the utmost concentration of brain. It is  better to play with concentration for two hours than to practice eight  without. I should say that four hours would be a good maximum practice  time--I never ask more of my pupils--and that during each minute of the  time the brain be as active as the fingers.                      NATIONALITY VERSUS THE CONSERVATORY SYSTEM    \"I think there is more value in the idea of a national conservatory than  in the idea of nationality as regards violin playing. No matter what his  birthplace, there is only one way in which a student can become an  artist--and that is to have a teacher who can teach! In Europe the best  teachers are to be found in the great national conservatories. Thibaud,  Ysaye--artists of the highest type--are products of the conservatory  system, with its splendid teachers. So is Kreisler, one of the greatest  artists, who studied in Vienna and Paris. Eddy Brown, the brilliant  American violinist, finished at the Budapest Conservatory. In the Paris  Conservatory the number of pupils in a class is strictly limited; and  from these pupils each professor chooses the very best--who may not be  able to pay for their course--for free instruction. At the Petrograd  Conservatory, where Wieniawski preceded me, there were hundreds of free  scholarships available. If a really big talent came along he always had  his opportunity. We took and taught those less talented at the  Conservatory in order to be able to give scholarships to the deserving  of limited means. In this way no real violinistic genius, whom poverty  might otherwise have kept from ever realizing his dreams, was deprived  of his chance in life. Among the pupils there in my class, having  scholarships, were Kathleen Parlow, Elman, Zimbalist, Heifetz and  Seidel.                                    VIOLIN MASTERY    \"Violin mastery? To me it represents the sum total of accomplishment on  the part of those who live in the history of the Art. All those who may  have died long since, yet the memory of whose work and whose creations  still lives, are the true masters of the violin, and its mastery is the  record of their accomplishment. As a child I remember the well-known  composers of the day were Marschner, Hiller, Nicolai and others--yet  most of what they have written has been forgotten. On the other hand  there are Tartini, Nardini, Paganini, Kreutzer, Dont and Rode--they  still live; and so do Ernst, Sarasate, Vieuxtemps and Wieniawski.  Joachim (incidentally the only great German violinist of whom I  know--and he was a Hungarian!), though he had but few great pupils, and  composed but little, will always be remembered because he, together with  David, gave violin virtuosity a nobler trend, and introduced a higher  ideal in the music played for violin. It is men such as these who always  will remain violin 'masters,' just as 'violin mastery' is defined by  what they have done.\"                  THE BACH VIOLIN SONATAS AND OTHER COMPOSITIONS    Replying to a question as to the value of the Bach violin sonatas,  Professor Auer said: \"My pupils always have to play Bach. I have  published my own revision of them with a New York house. The most  impressive thing about these Bach solo sonatas is they do not need an  accompaniment: one feels it would be superfluous. Bach composed so  rapidly, he wrote with such ease, that it would have been no trouble for  him to supply one had he felt it necessary. But he did not, and he was  right. And they still must be played as he has written them. We have the  'modern' orchestra, the 'modern' piano, but, thank heaven, no 'modern'  violin! Such indications as I have made in my edition with regard to  bowing, fingering, _nuances_ of expression, are more or less in accord  with the spirit of the times; but not a single note that Bach has  written has been changed. The sonatas are technically among the most  difficult things written for the violin, excepting Ernst and Paganini.  Not that they are hard in a modern way: Bach knew nothing of harmonics,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15536"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 579, (#3)"],[1,"in  many places perceptible. Pillars have been dug up, and some still remain  amidst the ruins; while the Farnesian Bull and the famous Hercules,  found in one of these halls announce the multiplicity and beauty of the  statues which once adorned the Thermae of Caracalla.\"    Before they commenced bathing in the _Thermae_, the Romans anointed  themselves with oil, in a room especially appropriated to the purpose;  and oil was again applied, with the addition of perfumes, on quitting  the bath. In a painting which has been engraved from one of the walls  in the baths of Titus, the room is represented filled with a number  of vases, and somewhat resembles an apothecary's shop. These vases  contained a variety of balsamic and oleaceous compositions for the  anointment, which, when ultimately performed, prepared the bathers for  the _sphaeristerium_, in which various amusements and exercises were  enjoyed. The subsequent operation of scraping the body with the strigil  has given way to a mode of freeing the body from perspiration and all  extraneous matter, by a sort of bag or glove of camel's hair, which is  used in Turkey; while flannel and brushes are substituted in other  parts.    The vapour-baths now used in Russia resemble very much those among the  ancient Romans. These are generally rudely built of wood, over an oven,  and the bathers receive the vapour at the requisite heat, reclining on  wooden benches,--while, more powerfully to excite perspiration, they  whip their bodies with birch boughs, and also use powerful friction.  They then wash themselves; and, as these vapour-baths are often  constructed on the banks of a river, throw themselves from the land  into the water; or sometimes, by way of variety, plunge into snow, and  roll themselves therein. This violent exercise and sudden transition  of temperature is almost overpowering to persons unhabituated to the  custom, and will oftentimes produce fainting,--though the patient, on  recovering, finds himself refreshed, and experiences a delightful sense  of mental, as well as bodily, vigour and energy. The enervating effects  of the extreme luxury and refinement practised in the Greek and Roman  baths are obviated in the Russian mode: to which may partly be ascribed  the power which the latter people have in undergoing fatigue and the  various hardships of their rigorous climate. Tooke says that without  doubt the Russians owe their longevity, robust health, their little  disposition to fatal complaints, and, above all, their happy and  cheerful temper, mostly to these vapour-baths. Lewis and Clarke, in  their voyage up the Missouri, have noticed the use of the vapour-bath in  a somewhat similar contrivance to the Russians among the savage tribes  of America;--so it appears that this effectual promoter of cleanliness  is one of the most simple, original, and natural, that can be employed  for that paramount duty.

The pier was this evening nearly  deserted by those bold spirits, who, when sea and sky conspire to frown  together, loved to resort there to while away their idle hours. Only a  few \"out-and-outers\" were now to be seen at their accustomed station,  defying the rough buffetings of the blast, which on more tender faces  might have acted almost with the keenness of a razor. Though the evening  certainly looked wild and stormy to an unpractised eye, still to those  who \"gauge the weather\" it was unaccompanied with those unerring  symptoms which usually usher in a gale. However, the appearance of the  night was so uninviting, as to have induced the local craft to run some  time before along shore for shelter; and the movements of the strange  vessel were consequently a matter of speculation to those on land. There  is something to our minds exceedingly interesting in a solitary vessel  at sea--it is a point on which you may hinge your attention--a living  thing on the desert-bosom of the main. For sometime her movements were  apparently very undecided, but though the weather seemed to be looking  up, she suddenly put about helm, and ran without further wavering right  for the shelter held out at Lanport. In less than twenty minutes she was  safe alongside the pier. She was one of the larger class of fishing  vessels and was well manned. The attention of the bystanders was now  directed to an individual who seemed to be a passenger, and who  immediately landed after conversing for a short while with the master.  The gentleman brought ashore an immoderately large carpet-bag, and  forthwith marched for the chief street of Lanport. When we say chief,  we, perhaps, ought to add that it was the only assemblage of buildings  in the village, which by the comparative uniformity of their  arrangement, could lay claim to such a title. On reaching the foot of  the declivity, the traveller, who was evidently much jaded with his  marine excursion, espied with symptoms of satisfaction, the antiquated  sign-post of an \"hostelrie\" swinging before him in the breeze. Without  further investigation, but with \"wandering steps and slow,\" he  decided on taking up his quarters at the \"Mermaid Inn and Tavern, by  Judith, (or Judy as she was called by some) Teague.\" This determination  of the traveller would, however, have turned out to be \"Hobson's choice\"  had his eyes wandered in quest of a rival establishment, for here Mrs.  Judy Teague reigned supreme amongst \"licensed victuallers,\" no rival  having hitherto been found bold enough to enter the field against her.  The leisurely advance of the traveller up the street, had given all the  old gossips and that numerous class who esteem other people's business  of infinitely greater consequence than their own, full opportunity to  remark on his dress and appearance; in which as faithful chroniclers we  have not gathered that there was anything remarkable--save and except  the enormous carpet-bag aforesaid, about which its owner seemed as  solicitous as the traveller in Rob Roy. A stranger was, at the period  we are describing, a _rara avis in terris_ indeed at Lanport; and it  may be conceived that the news of this arrival was discussed round every  hearth in the place within half an hour at the utmost. Mrs. Teague is  recorded to have advanced to the door with unwonted rapidity (bearing  in mind that she had halted a little since she was on the wrong side of  forty, from a rheumatic affection,) to meet such an \"iligant-looking  guest;\" and certain it is that he had not been two hours in the house,  before it was evident that both parties were on an excellent footing  together. The old lady was seen to come from the best--the parlour we  mean to say--of the Mermaid, with very unusual symptoms of good humour  on her countenance, considering (as Betsy the \"maid of all work\"  whispered to \"Jack Ostler,\") that her visage had generally a \"vinegar  cruet\" association; though we would not take upon ourselves to assert  that brandy had not a greater share in its composition.    The strange gentleman continued in close occupation of the parlour  during the entire evening. The mysterious carpet bag was secured in an  upper room, and its owner chased away the damps and cold of the season  by unusually liberal potations; in short, Mrs. Judith declared to the  numerous party of customers who had assembled from chance or curiosity  on her hearth, that he was the most liberal gentleman that had ever  crossed her threshold in the way of business, since Julius O'Brien  (commonly called the tippling exciseman,) had unexpectedly departed this  life by mistaking the steep staircase of the Mermaid for a single step,  one night when his brain was more than usually beclouded. The arrival of  the stranger, however, had nearly caused a schism between the hostess  and her leading customers; for the former had whilst he honoured the  Mermaid with his presence, engaged the parlour for his exclusive  accommodation--an arrangement contrary to all the rules of Lanport  etiquette; and he might have experienced rather a rude reception had not  Mrs. Judy given up her _sanctum sanctorum_ for the temporary use of  the \"elect.\"    Next day, the morning had passed away, nay, the sun was fast careering  towards the western horizon, and yet the stranger exhibited no  inclination to explore the locality of Lanport. Night at last set in,  but still he remained in close quarters as before.    This appeared the more strange, as the situation of Lanport was  singularly wild and interesting. The prospect from the wooded and rocky  heights of the coast was of great and commanding beauty; and the inland  view presented many scenes and objects highly calculated to invite the  attention of the lover of nature or the curious traveller. It was  evident that the stranger was deficient in both these points.    The history of the next day closely corresponded with that of the  preceding. There he sat. That night there was again a strong muster  around the capacious hearth of the Mermaid. If the stranger was  deficient in that inherent passion of the human mind--curiosity--not so  the villagers. But one sentiment seemed to pervade the assembled party,  and that may be summed up in the words \"Who _is_ he?\" An echo  responded \"Who _is_ he?\" Conjecture was literally at a fault. His  very appearance was unknown to all except the fortunate few"]]]
