In making the hollow silver beads they did not melt the silver, but beat  out a Mexican dollar until it was of the proper tenuity--frequently  annealing it in the forge as the work advanced. When the plate was ready  they carefully described on it, with an awl, a figure (which, by  courtesy, we will call a circle) that they conjectured would include a  disk large enough to make half a bead of the required size. The disk was  then cut out with scissors, trimmed, and used as a pattern to cut other  circular pieces by. One of the smiths proceeded to cut out the rest of  the planchets, while his partner formed them into hollow hemispheres  with his matrix and die. He did not put them at once into the cavity  from which they were to get their final shape, but first worked them a  little in one or more larger cavities, so as to bring them gradually to  the desired form. Next the hemispheres were leveled at the edges by a  method already described, and subsequently perforated by holding them,  convex surface downwards, on a piece of wood, and driving through them  the shank of a file with blows of a hammer. By this means of boring, a  neck was left projecting from the hole, which was not filed off until  the soldering was done. The hemispheres were now strung or, I may say,  spitted on a stout wire in pairs forming globes. The wire or spit  referred to was bent at one end and supplied with a washer to keep the  heads from slipping off, and all the pieces being pressed closely  together were secured in position by many wraps of finer wire at the  other end of the spit. The mixture of borax, saliva, and silver was next  applied to the seams of all the beads; they were put into the fire and  all soldered at one operation. When taken from the fire they were  finished by filing, polishing and blanching.    These Indians are quite fertile in design. In Pl. XIX are shown two  powder-chargers, which I consider very graceful in form. I have seen  many of these powder-chargers, all very graceful, but no two alike  except in cases where duplicates had been specially ordered. Their  designs upon bracelets and rings are of great variety. Ornaments for  bridles, consisting of broad bands of silver, sufficient in size and  number to almost entirely conceal the leather, are not particularly  handsome, but are greatly in demand among the Navajos and are  extensively manufactured by them. Leather belts studded with large  plates of silver are favorite articles of apparel, and often contain  metal to the value of forty or fifty dollars. Pl. XX represents an  Indian wearing such a belt, in which only three of the plates are shown.  Single and double crosses of silver are represented attached to his  necklace. The cross is much worn by the Navajos, among whom, I  understand, it is not intended to represent the \"Cross of Christ,\" but  is a symbol of the morning star. The lengthening of the lower limb,  however, is probably copied from the usual form of the Christian emblem.  These savage smiths also display much ingenuity in working from models  and from drawings of objects entirely new to them.    They are very wasteful of material. They usually preserve the clippings  and melt them in the crucible, or use them in soldering; but they make  no attempt to save the metal carried off in filing, polishing, and by  oxidizing in the forge, all of which is considerable. In one article of  silver, for which, allowing for clippings saved, 836 grains were given  to the smith, and the work on which I watched so closely throughout that  I am certain none of the material was stolen, there was a loss of 120  grains, or over 14 per cent.    The smiths whom I have seen working had no dividers, square, measure, or  any instrument of precision. As before stated, I have seen scissors used  as compasses, but as a rule they find approximate centers with the eye,  and cut all shapes and engrave all figures by the unaided guidance of  this unreliable organ. Often they cut out their designs in paper first  and from them mark off patterns on the metal. Even in the matter of  cutting patterns they do not seem to know the simple device of doubling  the paper in order to secure lateral uniformity.    Here ends my description of the smithcraft of a rude but docile and  progressive people. I trust that it may serve not only to illustrate  some aspects of their mental condition, their inventive and imitative  talents, but possibly to shed some light on the condition and diffusion  of the art of the metalist in the prehistoric days of our continent,  notwithstanding the fact that some elements of their craft are of recent  introduction and others of doubtful origin.

On returning to the Isle Aeaean,  Odysseus was warned by Circe of the dangers he would  encounter. He and his friends set forth, escaped the Sirens  (a sort of mermaidens), evaded the Clashing Rocks, which  close on ships (a fable known to the Aztecs), passed Scylla  (the pieuvre of antiquity) with loss of some of the  company, and reached Thrinacia, the Isle of the Sun. Here  the company of Odysseus, constrained by hunger, devoured  the sacred kine of the Sun, for which offence they were  punished by a shipwreck, when all were lost save Odysseus.  He floated ten days on a raft, and then reached the isle of  the goddess Calypso, who kept him as her lover for eight  years.    The first two years after the fall of Troy are now  accounted for. They were occupied, as we have seen, by  adventures with the Cicones, the Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops,  Aeolus, the Laestrygonians, by a year's residence with  Circe, by the descent into Hades, the encounters with the  Sirens, and Scylla, and the fatal sojourn in the isle of  Thrinacia. We leave Odysseus alone, for eight years,  consuming his own heart, in the island paradise of Calypso.    In Ithaca, the hero's home, things seem to have passed  smoothly till about the sixth year after the fall of Troy.  Then the men of the younger generation, the island chiefs,  began to woo Penelope, and to vex her son Telemachus.  Laertes, the father of Odysseus, was too old to help, and  Penelope only gained time by her famous device of weaving  and unweaving the web. The wooers began to put compulsion  on the Queen, quartering themselves upon her, devouring her  substance, and insulting her by their relations with her  handmaids. Thus Penelope pined at home, amidst her wasting  possessions. Telemachus fretted in vain, and Odysseus was  devoured by grief and home-sickness in the isle of Calypso.  When he had lain there for nigh eight years, the action of  the Odyssey begins, and occupies about six weeks.      DAY 1 (Book i).    The ordained time has now arrived, when by the counsels of  the Gods, Odysseus is to be brought home to free his house,  to avenge himself on the wooers, and recover his kingdom.  The chief agent in his restoration is Pallas Athene; the  first book opens with her prayer to Zeus that Odysseus may  be delivered. For this purpose Hermes is to be sent to  Calypso to bid her release Odysseus, while Pallas Athene in  the shape of Mentor, a friend of Odysseus, visits  Telemachus in Ithaca. She bids him call an assembly of the  people, dismiss the wooers to their homes, and his mother  to her father's house, and go in quest of his own father,  in Pylos, the city of Nestor, and Sparta, the home of  Menelaus. Telemachus recognises the Goddess, and the first  day closes.      DAY 2 (Book ii).    Telemachus assembles the people, but he has not the heart  to carry out Athene's advice. He cannot send the wooers  away, nor turn his mother out of her house. He rather  weakly appeals to the wooers' consciences, and announces  his intention of going to seek his father. They answer with  scorn, but are warned of their fate, which is even at the  doors, by Halitherses. His prophecy (first made when  Odysseus set out for Troy) tallies with the prophecy of  Teiresias, and the prayer of the Cyclops. The reader will  observe a series of portents, prophecies, and omens, which  grow more numerous and admonishing as their doom draws  nearer to the wooers. Their hearts, however, are hardened,  and they mock at Telemachus, who, after an interview with  Athene, borrows a ship and secretly sets out for Pylos.  Athene accompanies him, and his friends man his galley.      DAY 3 (Book iii).    They reach Pylos, and are kindly received by the aged  Nestor, who has no news about Odysseus. After sacrifice,  Athene disappears.      DAY 4 (Book iii).    The fourth day is occupied with sacrifice, and the talk of  Nestor. In the evening Telemachus (leaving his ship and  friends at Pylos) drives his chariot into Pherae, half way  to Sparta; Peisistratus, the soil of Nestor, accompanies  him.      DAY 5 (Book iv).    Telemachus and Peisistratus arrive at Sparta, where  Menelaus and Helen receive them kindly.      DAY 6 (Book iv).    Menelaus tells how he himself came home in the eighth year  after the fall of Troy. He had heard from Proteus, the Old  Man of the Sea, that Odysseus was alive, and a captive on  an island of the deep. Menelaus invites Telemachus to Stay  with him for eleven days or twelve, which Telemachus  declines to do. It will later appear that he made an even  longer stay at Sparta, though whether he changed his mind,  or whether we have here an inadvertence of the poet's it is  hard to determine. This blemish has been used as an  argument against the unity of authorship, but writers of  all ages have made graver mistakes.    On this same day (the sixth) the wooers in Ithaca learned  that Telemachus had really set out to I cruise after his  father.' They sent some of their number to lie in ambush  for him, in a certain strait which he was likely to pass on  his return to Ithaca. Penelope also heard of her son's  departure, but was consoled by a dream.      DAY 7 (Book v).    The seventh day finds us again in Olympus. Athene again  urges the release of Odysseus; and Hermes is sent to bid  Calypso let the hero go. Zeus prophecies that after twenty  days sailing, Odysseus will reach Scheria, and the  hospitable Phaeacians, a people akin to the Gods, who will  convey him to Ithaca. Hermes accomplishes the message to  Calypso.      DAYS 8-12-32 (Book v).    These days are occupied by Odysseus in making and launching  a raft; on the twelfth day from the beginning of the action  he leaves Calypso's isle. He sails for eighteen days, and  on the eighteenth day of his voyage (the twenty-ninth from  the beginning of the action), he sees Scheria. Poseidon  raises a storm against him, and it is not till the  thirty-second day from that in which Athene visited  Telemachus, that he lands in Scheria, the country of the  Phaeacians. Here he is again in fairy land. A rough, but  perfectly recognisable form of the Phaeacian myth, is found  in an Indian collection of marchen (already referred to) of  the twelfth century A.D. Here the Phaeacians are the  Vidyidhiris, and their old enemies the Cyclopes, are the  Rakshashas, a sort of giants. The Indian Odysseus, who  seeks the city of gold, passes by the home of an Indian  Aeolus, Satyavrata. His later adventures are confused, and  the Greek version retains only the more graceful fancies of  the marchen.      DAY 33 (Book vi).    Odysseus meets Nausicaa, daughter of Alcinous, the  Phaeacian King, and by her aid, and that of Athene, is  favourably received at the palace, and tells how he came  from Calypso's island. His name is still unknown to his  hosts.      DAY 34 (Books vii, viii, ix, x, xi, xii).    The Phaeacians and Odysseus display their skill in sports.  Nausicaa bids Odysseus farewell. Odysseus recounts to  Alcinous, and Arete, the Queen, those adventures in the two  years between the fall of Troy and his captivity in the  island of Calypso, which we have already described (pp.  xiii-xvii).      DAY 35 (Book xiii).    Odysseus is conveyed to Ithaca, in the evening, on one of  the magical barques of the Phaeacians.      DAY 36 (Books xiii, xiv, xv).    He wakens in Ithaca, which he does not at first recognise  He learns from Athene, for the first time, that the wooers  beset his house. She disguises him as an old man, and bids  him go to the hut of the swineherd Eumaeus, who is loyal to  his absent lord. Athene then goes to Lacedaemon, to bring  back Telemachus, who has now resided there for a month.  Odysseus won the heart of Eumaeus, who of course did not  recognise him, and slept in the swineherd's hut, while  Athene was waking Telemachus, in Lacedaemon, and bidding  him 'be mindful of his return.'      DAY 37 (Book xv).    Is spent by Odysseus in the swineherd's hut. Telemachus  reaches Pherae, half-way to Pylos.        DAY 38 (Book xv).    Telemachus reaches Pylos, but does not visit Nestor. To  save time he goes at once on board ship, taking with him an  unfortunate outlaw, Theoclymenus, a second-sighted man, or  the family of Melampus, in which the gift of prophecy was  hereditary. The ship passed the Elian coast at night, and  evaded the ambush of the wooers. Meanwhile Odysseus was  sitting up almost till dawn, listening to the history of  Eumaeus, the swineherd.      DAY 39 (Books xv, xvi).    Telemachus reaches the Isle of Ithaca, sends his ship to  the city, but himself, by advice of Athene, makes for the  hut of Eumaeus, where he meets, but naturally does not  recognise, his disguised father. He sends Eumaeus to  Penelope with news of his arrival, and then Athene reveals  Odysseus to Telemachus. The two plot the death of the  wooers. Odysseus bids Telemachus remove, on a favourable  opportunity, the arms which were disposed as trophies on  the walls of the hall at home. (There is a slight  discrepancy between the words of this advice and the manner  in which it is afterwards executed.) During this interview,  the ship of Telemachus, the wooers who had been in ambush,  and Eumaeus, all reached the town of Ithaca. In the evening  Eumaeus returned to his hut, where Athene had again  disguised Odysseus.      DAY 40 (Books xvii, xviii, xix, xx).    The story is now hastening to its close, and many events  are crowded into the fortieth day. Telemachus goes from the  swineherd's hut to the city, and calls his guest,  Theoclymenus, to the palace. The second-sighted man  prophesies of the near revenge of Odysseus. In the  afternoon, Odysseus (still disguised) and Eumaeus reach the  city, the dog Argos recognises the hero, and dies. Odysseus  goes begging through his own hall, and is struck by  Antinous, the proudest of the wooers. Late in the day  Eumaeus goes home, and Odysseus fights with the braggart  beggar Irus."]]]
