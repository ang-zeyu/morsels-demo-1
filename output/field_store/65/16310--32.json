It has obtained  in almost all ages of the world, and among many different nations.  It is a fine thing or a foolish thing, as the case may be; an  encouragement to friendliness, or a tribute to fashion; an expression  of good nature, or a bid for favour; an outgoing of generosity, or  a disguise of greed; a cheerful old custom, or a futile old farce,  according to the spirit which animates it and the form which it takes.    But when this ancient and variously interpreted tradition of a day  of gifts was transferred to the Christmas season, it was brought  into vital contact with an idea which must transform it, and with an  example which must lift it up to a higher plane. The example is the  life of Jesus. The idea is unselfish interest in the happiness of  others.    The great gift of Jesus to the world was himself. He lived with and  for men. He kept back nothing. In every particular and personal gift  that he made to certain people there was something of himself that  made it precious.    For example, at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, it was his thought for  the feelings of the giver of the feast, and his wish that every guest  should find due entertainment, that lent the flavour of a heavenly  hospitality to the wine which he provided.    When he gave bread and fish to the hungry multitude who had followed  him out among the hills by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were  refreshed and strengthened by the sense of the personal care of Jesus  for their welfare, as much as by the food which he bestowed upon them.  It was another illustration of the sweetness of \"a dinner of herbs,  where love is.\"    The gifts of healing which he conferred upon many different kinds of  sufferers were, in every case, evidences that Jesus was willing to  give something of himself, his thought, his sympathy, his vital power,  to the men and women among whom he lived. Once, when a paralytic was  brought to Jesus on a bed, he surprised everybody, and offended many,  by giving the poor wretch the pardon of his sins, before he gave new  life to his body. That was just because Jesus thought before he gave;  because he desired to satisfy the deepest need; because in fact he  gave something of himself in every gift. All true Christmas-giving  ought to be after this pattern.    Not that it must all be solemn and serious. For the most part it deals  with little wants, little joys, little tokens of friendly feeling. But  the feeling must be more than the token; else the gift does not really  belong to Christmas.    It takes time and effort and unselfish expenditure of strength to make  gifts in this way. But it is the only way that fits the season.    The finest Christmas gift is not the one that costs the most money,  but the one that carries the most love.      II    But how seldom Christmas comes--only once a year; and how soon it is  over--a night and a day! If that is the whole of it, it seems not  much more durable than the little toys that one buys of a fakir on the  street-corner. They run for an hour, and then the spring breaks, and  the legs come off, and nothing remains but a contribution to the dust  heap.    But surely that need not and ought not to be the whole of  Christmas--only a single day of generosity, ransomed from the dull  servitude of a selfish year,--only a single night of merry-making,  celebrated in the slave-quarters of a selfish race! If every gift  is the token of a personal thought, a friendly feeling, an unselfish  interest in the joy of others, then the thought, the feeling, the  interest, may remain after the gift is made.    The little present, or the rare and long-wished-for gift (it matters  not whether the vessel be of gold, or silver, or iron, or wood, or  clay, or just a small bit of birch bark folded into a cup), may carry  a message something like this:    \"I am thinking of you to-day, because it is Christmas, and I wish you  happiness. And to-morrow, because it will be the day after Christmas,  I shall still wish you happiness; and so on, clear through the year.  I may not be able to tell you about it every day, because I may be  far away; or because both of us may be very busy; or perhaps because I  cannot even afford to pay the postage on so many letters, or find the  time to write them. But that makes no difference. The thought and the  wish will be here just the same. In my work and in the business of  life, I mean to try not to be unfair to you or injure you in any way.  In my pleasure, if we can be together, I would like to share the fun  with you. Whatever joy or success comes to you will make me glad.  Without pretense, and in plain words, good-will to you is what I mean,  in the Spirit of Christmas.\"    It is not necessary to put a message like this into high-flown  language, to swear absolute devotion and deathless consecration. In  love and friendship, small, steady payments on a gold basis are better  than immense promissory notes. Nor, indeed, is it always necessary to  put the message into words at all, nor even to convey it by a tangible  token. To feel it and to act it out--that is the main thing.    There are a great many people in the world whom we know more or less,  but to whom for various reasons we cannot very well send a Christmas  gift. But there is hardly one, in all the circles of our acquaintance,  with whom we may not exchange the touch of Christmas life.    In the outer circles, cheerful greetings, courtesy, consideration;  in the inner circles, sympathetic interest, hearty congratulations,  honest encouragement; in the inmost circle, comradeship, helpfulness,  tenderness,--      \"_Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind    Durable from the daily dust of life._\"    After all, Christmas-living is the best kind of Christmas-giving.           *       *       *       *       *          A SHORT CHRISTMAS SERMON          KEEPING CHRISTMAS        ROMANS, xiv, 6: _He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto      the Lord._    It is a good thing to observe Christmas day. The mere marking of times  and seasons, when men agree to stop work and make merry together, is  a wise and wholesome custom. It helps one to feel the supremacy of the  common life over the individual life. It reminds a man to set his own  little watch, now and then, by the great clock of humanity which runs  on sun time.    But there is a better thing than the observance of Christmas day, and  that is, keeping Christmas.    Are you willing to forget what you have done for other people, and to  remember what other people have done for you; to ignore what the world  owes you, and to think what you owe the world; to put your rights  in the background, and your duties in the middle distance, and your  chances to do a little more than your duty in the foreground; to see  that your fellow-men are just as real as you are, and try to look  behind their faces to their hearts, hungry for joy; to own that  probably the only good reason for your existence is not what you are  going to get out of life, but what you are going to give to life; to  close your book of complaints against the management of the universe,  and look around you for a place where you can sow a few seeds of  happiness--are you willing to do these things even for a day? Then you  can keep Christmas.    Are you willing to stoop down and consider the needs and the desires  of little children; to remember the weakness and loneliness of people  who are growing old; to stop asking how much your friends love you,  and ask yourself whether you love them enough; to bear in mind the  things that other people have to bear on their hearts; to try to  understand what those who live in the same house with you really  want, without waiting for them to tell you; to trim your lamp so that  it will give more light and less smoke, and to carry it in front  so that your shadow will fall behind you; to make a grave for your  ugly thoughts, and a garden for your kindly feelings, with the gate  open--are you willing to do these things even for a day? Then you can  keep Christmas.    Are you willing to believe that love is the strongest thing in  the world--stronger than hate, stronger than evil, stronger than  death--and that the blessed life which began in Bethlehem nineteen  hundred years ago is the image and brightness of the Eternal Love?  Then you can keep Christmas.    And if you keep it for a day, why not always?    But you can never keep it alone.           *       *       *       *       *          TWO CHRISTMAS PRAYERS          A CHRISTMAS PRAYER FOR THE HOME        Father of all men, look upon our family,    Kneeling together before Thee,    And grant us a true Christmas.      With loving heart we bless Thee:      For the gift of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ,      For the peace He brings to human homes,      For the good-will He teaches to sinful men,      For the glory of Thy goodness shining in His face.      With joyful voice we praise Thee:      For His lowly birth and His rest in the manger,      For the pure tenderness of His mother Mary,      For the fatherly care that protected Him,      For the Providence that saved the Holy Child        To be the Saviour of the world.

It is a great error to allow pupils to think of their  library work as drudgery, assigned solely to keep them busy or to make  the course difficult. There are too few boys to-day with a genuine love  of books, partly no doubt due to the fact that a reference library has  become for them, not a rich mine of interesting matter, but a  hydra-headed interrogation point. A great good has been done the student  who has been taught the pleasure of using books. Nor is such a thing  impossible. Nothing gives greater satisfaction to the normal high school  boy than to find an error in the text, the teacher's statements, or the  map. He takes pleasure in confuting the statistics or judgments quoted  in class, by others of opposite trend, encountered in his reading. He  enjoys asking keen questions. If the student is told that the library  work is for the purpose of cultivating his powers of investigation and  adding to the matter in the text many interesting details; if the  library requirements are reasonable and wisely directed; if he is given  an opportunity to _use_ the information he has gathered from his  reading, his interest in books will steadily increase.    The teacher should explain the value of remembering accurately the  titles and the authors of books used for reference. The silly habit of  referring to an authority as \"the book bound in green\" or \"the large  book by what's his name\" is easily prevented if taken in time.    The teacher should discover by assignments made in class what degree of  proficiency in the use of an index is already possessed by his pupils.  There are few classes where the use of an index is thoroughly  understood. Time should be taken to demonstrate the quickest possible  methods of finding what a book contains. The use of the catalogue and  card index should be carefully explained and illustrated.    Attention should be called to the best sources on the various phases of  the history to be studied. There ought to be no poor histories in the  library, but if there are any to which the students have access, warning  should be given against their use.    The value of periodicals and current literature for work in history  should be illustrated and the use of _Poole's Index_ and the _Readers  Guide_ explained.    The class should be acquainted with the rules of the library and  cautioned against the misuse of books. The necessity of leaving  reference books where all the class can use them should be made  apparent.    Direction in the use of the library, like instruction in the method of  study, is a prerequisite to the best results in high school history  classes, for no matter how conscientious the teacher, the recitation  will be deadly if the student has no working knowledge of the library  nor proper method of preparation. A class unable to ask intelligent  questions about the work is not ready for the presentation of additional  matter by the teacher. It is no difficult matter for a teacher to  entertain his class for an hour with interesting incidents of the period  in which the lesson occurs. A history teacher who cannot talk  interestingly for an hour on any of the great periods of history has  surely missed his calling. But to keep a class quiet, to retain their  attention, to amuse and entertain, is far from making history vital. If  the recitation is to be really vital, the students must do most of the  talking, the criticizing, and the questioning. There can be none of  these worth while without proper preparation.          III    THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE LESSON      _Careful assignment will reveal to the student the relation of geography  and history_    The recitation can never hope to achieve its maximum helpfulness unless  the lesson be intelligently assigned. The work required must be  reasonable in amount, and not so exacting as to discourage interest.  Daily direction to look up unfamiliar words, expressions, and allusions  must be given until the habit becomes fixed. Warning against possible  geographical misconceptions should be given when necessary, together  with directions to use the map for places, routes, and boundaries. A few  questions asked in advance, with the purpose of bringing out the  relation of the geography to the history in the lesson, will be of great  assistance. For example, if the class are to study the Louisiana  Purchase, the full significance of that revolutionary event will be made  much clearer if the student is asked to prepare answers before coming to  class to such questions as the following:--         1. What States are included in the purchase?         2. What is its area? How does it compare with the area of the          original thirteen States?         3. What geographical reasons caused Napoleon to sell it?         4. What influence did the purchase have on our retention of the          territory east of the Mississippi? Why?         5. How many people live to-day in the territory included in the          purchase?      _His power of analysis and criticism will be stimulated_    A lesson should be so assigned that the student will read the text with  his eye critically open to inconsistencies, contradictions, and  inaccuracies. With a text of six hundred pages, and with a hundred and  eighty recitations in which to cover them, it is not too much to expect  that the average of three or four pages daily shall be studied so  thoroughly that the student can analyze and summarize each day's lesson.  The teacher should not make such analysis in advance of the recitation,  but he should so assign the lesson that the student will be prepared to  give one when he comes to class. A word in advance by the teacher will  prompt the student who is studying the American Revolution, to classify  its causes as direct and indirect, economic and political, social and  religious. There is no difficulty in finding good authorities who  disagree as to the effect on America of the English trade restrictions.  Callendar's _Economic History of the United States_ quotes five of the  best authorities on this point, and covers the case in a few pages. A  reference by the teacher to this or some other authority will bring out  a lively discussion on the justice of the American resistance. Let the  class be asked to account for the colonial opposition to the Townshend  Acts, when the Stamp Act Congress had declared that the regulation of  the Colonies' external trade was properly within the powers of  Parliament. Let the class be asked to explain a statement that the  Declaration of Independence does not mention the real underlying causes  of the Revolution. A few suggestions and advanced questions of this sort  will stimulate a critical analysis of the statements in the text, and  send the student to class keen for an intelligent discussion.    Ordinarily, when a class is averaging three or four pages of the text  daily, it is an error for the teacher to point out in advance certain  dates and statistics that need not be memorized. Such selection should  be left to the student. During the recitation the teacher will discover  what dates, statistics, and other matter the student has selected as  worthy to be memorized, and if correction is necessary it may then be  made. It dulls the edge of the pupil's enthusiasm to be told in advance  that some of the text is not worthy to be remembered. Furthermore such  instruction does nothing to develop the student's sense of historical  proportion, for it substitutes the judgment of the teacher for that of  the pupil.    Advance questions asking explanation of statements made in the text, or  by other authors dealing with the same period, insure that the lesson  will be read understandingly and that the author's statements will be  carefully analyzed. Such declarations as the following are illustrations  of statements whose explanation might profitably be required in  advance:--         1. \"The Constitution was extracted by necessity from a reluctant          people.\"         2. \"Oregon was a make-weight for Texas.\"         3. \"The greatest evil of slavery was that it prevented the South          from accumulating capital.\"         4. \"The day that France possesses New Orleans we must marry          ourselves to the British fleet.\"         5. \"The cause of free labor won a substantial triumph in the          Missouri Compromise.\"         6. \"The second war with England was not one of necessity, policy,          or interest on the part of the Americans; it was rather one of          party prejudice and passion.\"      _The conditions in other countries will add to his comprehension of the  facts in the lesson_    In so far as the next lesson requires an understanding of the history or  conditions of another country, the attention of the class should be  directed in advance to such necessity. Special references or brief  reports may be advisable. A few well-selected advance questions will  send the class to recitation prepared to discuss what otherwise the  teacher must explain. A few questions on the character of James II, his  ideals of government, the chief causes of the revolution of 1688, and  its most important results will do much to explain the colonial  resistance to Andros. A few questions designed to bring out the  imperative necessity of English resistance to Napoleon will make clear  the hostile commercial decrees, impressment, and interference with the  rights of neutral ships. Such questions reduce the necessity of  explanation by the teacher to a minimum.      _His disposition to study intensively will be encouraged_    If the teacher expects the class to deal more intensively than the text  with the matters discussed in the lesson, a few advance questions will  be of great assistance. Suppose, for example, that the text contents  itself with saying that for political reasons the first United States  Bank was not rechartered,"]]]
