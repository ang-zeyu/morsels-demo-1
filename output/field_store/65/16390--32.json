Oh soft night, oh night of love,  Smile on our bliss serene,  All the stars that shine above  Surround the heaven's queen!  Time it flies without return,  Forgetting our tenderness!  Far from thee I'll ever burn,  In lonely strait and stress.  Passioned zephyrs  Waft your caresses,  Passioned zephyrs  Soft are your kisses.  O soft night, oh night of love,  Smile on our bliss serene;  All the stars that shine above  Surround the heaven's queen.    (Giulietta and Nicklausse enter.)      HOFFMAN.    For me, by Jove, that is not what's enchanting!  At the feet of the beauty who gives us joy  Does pleasure sigh?  No, with laughing mouth no sorrows 'ere descanting.      BACCHIC SONG.

The sky lends you its brightness,      Beauty,  But you hide in hearts of steel,      Hell!  Bliss of paradise  Where love meets,  Oaths, cursed spirits,      Dreams of life!      Oh chastity,      Oh purity,        Lies!      THE CHORUS.    To the devil those who weep,      etc., etc.      SCHLEMIL (entering).      I see all is joy. Congratulations, madame.      GUILIETTA.      What! Why, I've wept for you three whole days.      PITICHINACCIO.      Good.      SCHLEMIL (to Pitichinaccio).      Microbe!      PITICHINACCIO.      Hola!      GIULIETTA.    Calm yourselves!  We have a strange poet among us.    (Presenting) Hoffman!      SCHLEMIL (with bad grace).      Monsieur!      HOFFMAN.      Monsieur!      GIULIETTA (to Schlemil).      Smile on us, I beg,  And come take your place  At pharaoh!      THE CHORUS.      Bravo! To pharaoh!    (Giulietta after having invited all to follow her, goes toward door.    Hoffman offers his hand to Giulietta. Schlemil comes between.)      SCHLEMIL (taking Giulietta's hand).      By heavens!      GIULETTA.      To the game, gentlemen, to the game!      THE CHORUS.      To the game, the game!    (All go out except Hoffman and Nicklausse.)      NICKLAUSSE.    One word! I have two horses saddled. At the first dream  That Hoffman permits himself, I carry him off.      HOFFMAN.    And what dream ever could be born  By such realities?  Does one love a courtezan?      NICKLAUSSE.      Yet this Schlemil...      HOFFMAN.    I am not Schlemil.      NICKLAUSSE.      Take care, the devil is clever.    DAPERTUTTO (appears at back).      HOFFMAN.    Were it so,  If he makes me love her, may he damn me,  Come!      NICKLAUSSE.      Let us go.    (They go out.)      DAPERTUTTO (alone).    Yes!... to fight you.  The eyes of Giulietta are a sure weapon,  It needed that Schlemil fail,  Faith of captain and soldier,  You'll do like him.  I will that Giulietta shall use sorcery on you.    (Drawing from his finger a ring with a big sparkling diamond.)    Turn, turn, mirror, where the lark is caught,  Sparkle diamond, fascinate, draw her...    The lark or the woman    To this conquering bait    Comes with wing or with heart;  One leaves her life, the other her soul.  Turn, turn, mirror where the lark is caught.  Sparkle, diamond, fascinate, attract her.    (Giulietta appears and advances fascinated toward the diamond that    Dapertutto holds towards her.)      DAPERTUTTO (placing the ring on Giuliettas finger).      GIULIETTA.      What do you await from your servant?      DAPERTUTTO.    Good, you have divined  At seducing hearts above all others wise,  You have given me  The shade of Schlemil! I vary  My pleasures and I pray you  To get for me to-day  The reflection of Hoffman!      GIULIETTA.      What! his reflection.      DAPERTUTTO.      Yes.  His reflection! You doubt  The power of your eyes?      GIULIETTA.      No.      DAPERTUTTO.    Who knows. Your Hoffman dreams, perhaps better.  (Severely) Yes, I was there, a while back, listening.  (With irony) He defies you...      GIULIETTA.    Hoffman? 'tis well!... From this day  I'll make him my plaything.    (Hoffman enters.)      DAPERTUTTO.      'Tis he!    (Dapertutto goes out. Hoffman intends to do the same.)      GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).      You leave me.      HOFFMAN (mockingly).      I have lost everything.      GIULIETTA.    What? you too...  Ah, you do me wrong.  Without pity, without mercy,  Go!... Go!...      HOFFMAN.    Your tears betrayed you.  Ah! I love you... even at the price of my life.      GIULIETTA.    Ah, unfortunate, but you do not know  That an hour, a moment, may prove fatal?  That my love will cost your life if you remain?  That Schlemil, this night, may strike you in my arms?    Listen to my prayer;    My life is wholly yours.  Everywhere I promise to accompany your steps.      HOFFMAN.    Ye gods with what bliss ye fire my heart?  Like a concert divine your voice does move me;  With a fire soft yet burning my being is devoured;  Your glances in mine have spent their flame,  Like radiant stars  And I feel, my well beloved,  Pass your perfumed breath  On my lips and on my eyes.      GIULIETTA.    Yet, to-day, strengthen my courage  By leaving me something of you!      HOFFMAN.      What do you mean?      GIULIETTA.    Listen and don't laugh at me.    (She takes Hoffman in her arms and finds a mirror.)    What I want is your faithful image,  To reproduce your features, your look, your visage,  The reflection that I see above me bend.      HOFFMAN.    My reflection? What folly!      GIULIETTA.      No! for it can detach itself  From the polished glass  And come quite whole in my heart to hide.      HOFFMAN.      In your heart?      GIULIETTA.    In my heart. 'Tis I who beg thee,  Hoffman, give me my wish.      HOFFMAN.      My reflection?      GIULIETTA.    Your reflection. Yes, wisdom or folly,  I await, I demand.    (Ensemble.)      HOFFMAN.    Ecstasy, unappeased bliss,  Strange and soft terror,  My reflection, my soul, my life  To you, always to you!      GIULIETTA.    If your presence I lose,  I would keep of you  Your reflection, your soul, your life;  Dear one, give them me.      GIULIETTA (suddenly).      Schlemil!    (Schlemil enters followed by Nicklausse, Dapertutto, Pittichinaccio and    others.)      SCHLEMIL.    I was sure of it! Together!  Come, gentlemen, come,  'Tis for Hoffman, it seems to me  That we are abandoned.    (Ironic laughter.)      HOFFMAN.      Monsieur!      GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).      Silence!      (Aside) I love you, he has my key.      PITICHINACCIO (to Schlemil).      Let us kill him.      SCHLEMIL.      Patience!      DAPERTUTTO (to Hoffman).      How pale you are!      HOFFMAN.      Me!      DAPERTUTTO (showing him a mirror).      See rather.      HOFFMAN (amazed).      Heavens!      GIULIETTA.    Listen, gentlemen,  Here come the gondolas,  The hour of barcaroles  And of farewells!    (Schlemil conducts the guests out. Giulietta goes away throwing a look    at Hoffman. Dapertutto remains. Nicklausse goes toward Hoffman.)      NICKLAUSSE.      Are you coming?      HOFFMAN.      Not yet.      NICKLAUSSE.      Why? Very well. I understand, Good-by.      (Aside). But I'll watch over him.    (He goes out.)      SCHLEMIL.      What do you wait for?        HOFFMAN.      That you give me a certain key I've sworn to have.      SCHLEMIL.      You shall have this key, sir, only with my life.      HOFFMAN.      Then I shall have one and the other.      SCHLEMIL.      That remains to be seen. On guard!      DAPERTUTTO.      You have no sword (presenting his own). Take mine!      HOFFMAN.      Thank you.      CHORUS (in the wings).    Sweet night, oh night of love,  Smile on our bliss serene  When the stars that shine above  Greet the heaven'ly Queen.    (Hoffman and Schlemil fight. Schlemil falls mortally wounded. Hoffman    bends and takes the key from around his neck. He rushes to Giulietta's    room.

In fact, at a time when Jews in  Spain assumed the mask of Christianity to escape persecution, Russian  and Polish Christians by birth could choose, with little fear of danger,  to lead the Jewish life. It was not till about the eighteenth century  that the Government began to resort to the usual methods of eradicating  heresy. Katharina Weigel, a lady famous for her beauty, who embraced  Judaism, was decapitated in Cracow at the instigation of Bishop Peter  Gamrat. On the deposition of his wife, Captain Vosnitzin of the Polish  navy was put to death by auto-da-fe (July 15, 1738). The eminent \"Ger  Zedek,\" Count Valentine Pototzki, less fortunate than his comrade and  fellow-convert Zaremba, was burnt at the stake in Vilna (May 24, 1749),  and his teacher in the Jewish doctrines, Menahem Mann, was tortured and  executed a few months later, at the age of seventy. But these measures  proved of little avail. According to Martin Bielski, the noted  historian, Jews saved their proselytes from the impending doom by  transporting them to Turkey. Many of them sought refuge in Amsterdam.  For those who remained behind their new coreligionists provided through  collections made for that purpose in Russia and in Germany. To this day  these Russian and Polish proselytes adhere steadfastly to their faith,  and whether they migrate to America or Palestine to escape the  persecution of their countrymen, they seldom, if ever, indulge in the  latitudinarianism into which many of longer Jewish lineage fall so  readily when removed from old moorings.[17]    That the Russian Jews of the day were not altogether unenlightened, that  they not only practiced the Law devoutly, but also studied it  diligently, and cultivated the learning of the time as well, we may  safely infer from researches recently made. Cyril, or Constantine, \"the  philosopher,\" the apostle to the Slavonians, acquired a knowledge of  Hebrew while at Kherson, and was probably aided by Jews in his  translation of the Bible into Slavonic. Manuscripts of Russo-Jewish  commentaries to the Scriptures, written as early as 1094 and 1124, are  still preserved in the Vatican and Bodleian libraries, and copyists were  doing fairly good work at Azov in 1274.    Jewish scholars frequented celebrated seats of learning in foreign  lands. Before the end of the twelfth century traces of them are to be  found in France, Italy, and Spain. That in the eleventh century Judah  Halevi of Toledo and Nathan of Rome should have been familiar with  Russian words cannot but be attributed to their contact with Russian  Jews. However, in the case of these two scholars, it may possibly be  ascribed to their great erudition or extensive travels. But the many  Slavonic expressions occurring in the commentaries of Rashi (1040-1105),  and employed by Joseph Caro (ab. 1140), Benjamin of Tudela (ab. 1160),  and Isaac of Vienna (ab. 1250), lend color to Harkavy's contention, that  Russian was once the vernacular of the Russian Jews, and they also argue  in favor of our contention, that these natives of the \"land of  Canaan\"--as the country of the Slavs was then called in Hebrew--came  into personal touch with the \"lights and leaders\" of other Jewish  communities. Indeed, Rabbi Moses of Kiev is mentioned as one of the  pupils of Jacob Tam, the Tosafist of France (d. 1170), and Asheri, or  Rosh, of Spain is reported to have had among his pupils Rabbi Asher and  Master (Bahur) Jonathan from Russia. From these peripatetic scholars  perhaps came the martyrs of 1270, referred to in the _Memorbuch_ of  Mayence. It was Rabbi Moses who, while still in Russia, corresponded  with Samuel ben Ali, head of the Babylonian Academy, and called the  attention of Western scholars to certain Gaonic decisions. Another  rabbi, Isaac, or Itshke, of Chernigov, was probably the first Talmudist  in England, and his decisions were regarded as authoritative on certain  occasions. These and others like them wrote super-commentaries on the  commentaries of Rashi and Ibn Ezra, the most popular and profound  scholars medieval Jewry produced, and made copies of the works of other  authors.[18]    Soon the Russo-Polish Jews established at home what they had been  compelled to seek abroad. Hearing of the advantages offered in the great  North-East, German Jews flocked thither in such numbers as to dominate  and absorb the original Russians and Poles. A new element asserted  itself. Names like Ashkenazi, Heilperin, Hurwitz, Landau, Luria,  Margolis, Schapiro, Weil, Zarfati, etc., variously spelled, took the  place, through intermarriage and by adoption, of the ancient Slavonic  nomenclature. The language, manners, modes of thought, and, to a certain  extent, even the physiognomy of the earlier settlers, underwent a more  or less radical change. In some provinces the conflict lasted longer  than in others. To this day not a few Russian Jews would seem to be of  Slavonic rather than Semitic extraction. As late as the sixteenth  century there was still a demand in certain places for a Russian  translation of the Hebrew Book of Common Prayer, and in 1635 Rabbi Meir  Ashkenazi, who came from Frankfort-on-the-Main to study in Lublin, and  was retained as rabbi in Mohilev-on-the-Dnieper, had cause to exclaim,  \"Would to God that our coreligionists all spoke the same  language--German.\"[19] Even Maimon, in the latter half of the eighteenth  century, mentions one, by no means an exception, who did not \"understand  the Jewish language, and made use, therefore, of the Russian.\"[20] But  by the middle of the seventeenth century the amalgamation was almost  complete. It resulted in a product entirely new. As the invasion of  England by the Normans produced the Anglo-Saxon, so the inundation of  Russia by the Germans produced the Slav-Teuton. This is the clue to the  study of the Haskalah, as will appear from what follows.    Russo-Poland gradually became the cynosure of the Talmudic world, the  \"Aksanye shel Torah,\" the asylum of the Law, whence \"enlargement and  deliverance\" arose for the traditions which the Jews carried with them,  through fire and water, during the dreary centuries of their dispersion.  It became to Jews what Athens was to ancient Greece, Rome to medieval  Christendom, New England to our early colonies. With the invention and  importation of the printing-press, the publication and acquisition of  the Bible, the Talmud, and most of the important rabbinic works were  facilitated. As a consequence, yeshibot, or colleges, for the study of  Jewish literature, were founded in almost every community. Their fame  reached distant lands. It became a popular saying that \"from Kiev shall  go forth the Law, and the word of God from Starodub.\" Horodno, the  vulgar pronunciation of Grodno, was construed to mean Har Adonai, \"the  Mount of the Lord.\" A pious rabbi did not hesitate to write to a  colleague, \"Be it known to the high honor of your glory that it is  preferable by far to dwell in the land of the Russ and promote the study  of the Torah in Israel than in the land of Israel.\"[21] Especially the  part of Poland ultimately swallowed up by Russia was the new Palestine  of the Diaspora. Thither flocked all desirous of becoming adepts in the  dialectics of the rabbis, \"of learning how to swim in the sea of the  Talmud.\" It was there that the voluminous works of Hebrew literature  were studied, literally \"by day and by night,\" and the subtleties of the  Talmudists were developed to a degree unprecedented in Jewish history.  Thither was sent, from the distant Netherlands, the youngest son of  Manasseh ben Israel, and he \"became mighty in the Talmud and master of  four languages.\" Thither came, from Prague, the afterwards famous  Cabbalist, author, and rabbi, Isaiah Horowitz (ab. 1555-1630), and there  he chose to remain the rest of his days. Thither also went, from  Frankfort, the above-mentioned Meir Ashkenazi, who, according to some,  was the first author of note in White Russia.    From everywhere they came \"to pour water on the hands and sit at the  feet\" of the great ones of the second Palestine.[22]    For Jewish solidarity was more than a word in those days. \"Sefardim\" had  not yet learned to boast of aristocratic lineage, nor \"Ashkenazim\" to  look down contemptuously upon their Slavonic coreligionists. It was  before the removal of civil disabilities from one portion of the Jewish  people had sowed the seed of arrogance toward the other less favored  portion. Honor was accorded to whom it was due, regardless of the  locality in which he happened to have been born. Glueckel von Hameln  states in her _Memoirs_ that preference was sometimes given to the  decisions of the \"great ones of Poland,\" and mentions with pride that  her brother Shmuel married the daughter of the great Reb Shulem of  Lemberg.[23] With open arms, Amsterdam, Frankfort, Fuerth, Konigsberg,  Metz, Prague, and other communities renowned for wealth and learning,  welcomed the acute Talmudists of Brest, Grodno, Kovno, Lublin, Minsk,  and Vilna, whenever they were willing or compelled to consider a call.  The practice of summoning Russo-Polish rabbis to German posts was  carried so far that it aroused the displeasure of the Western scholars,  and they complained of being slighted.[24]    The reverence for Slavonic learning was strikingly illustrated during  the years following the Cossack massacres, when many Russo-Polish rabbis  fled for safety to foreign lands. Frankfort, Fuerth, Prague, and Vienna  successively elected the fugitive Shabbatai Horowitz of Ostrog as their  religious guide. David Taz of Vladimir became rabbi of Steinitz in  Moravia; Ephraim Hakohen was called to Trebitsch in Moravia and to Ofen  in Hungary; David of Lyda, to Mayence and Amsterdam, and Naphtali Kohen,  to Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1704, and later to Breslau.
