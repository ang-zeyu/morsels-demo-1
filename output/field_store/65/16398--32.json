Well know I that the journey  is weary; and my own heart wearies also for the home in England,  where those I love are keeping feast this Christmas eve. But we  have work to do before we feast to-night. For this is the  Yuletide, and the heathen people of the forest have gathered at  the thunder-oak of Geismar to worship their god, Thor. Strange  things will be seen there, and deeds which make the soul black.  But we are sent to lighten their darkness; and we will teach our  kinsmen to keep a Christmas with us such as the woodland has never  known. Forward, then, and let us stiffen up our feeble knees!\"    A murmur of assent came from the men. Even the horses seemed to  take fresh heart. They flattened their backs to draw the heavy  loads, and blew the frost from their nostrils as they pushed  ahead.    The night grew broader and less oppressive. A gate of brightness  was opened secretly somewhere in the sky; higher and higher  swelled the clear moon-flood, until it poured over the eastern  wall of forest into the road. A drove of wolves howled faintly in  the distance, but they were receding, and the sound soon died  away. The stars sparkled merrily through the stringent air; the  small, round moon shone like silver; little breaths of the  dreaming wind wandered whispering across the pointed fir-tops, as  the pilgrims toiled bravely onward, following their clue of light  through a labyrinth of darkness.    After a while the road began to open out a little. There were  spaces of meadow-land, fringed with alders, behind which a  boisterous river ran, clashing through spears of ice.    Rude houses of hewn logs appeared in the openings, each one  casting a patch of inky blackness upon the snow. Then the  travellers passed a larger group of dwellings, all silent and  unlighted; and beyond, they saw a great house, with many  outbuildings and enclosed courtyards, from which the hounds bayed  furiously, and a noise of stamping horses came from the stalls.  But there was no other sound of life. The fields around lay bare  to the moon. They saw no man, except that once, on a path that  skirted the farther edge of a meadow, three dark figures passed  by, running very swiftly.    Then the road plunged again into a dense thicket, traversed it,  and climbing to the left, emerged suddenly upon a glade, round and  level except at the northern side, where a swelling hillock was  crowned with a huge oak-tree. It towered above the heath, a giant  with contorted arms, beckoning to the host of lesser trees.  \"Here,\" cried Winfried, as his eyes flashed and his hand lifted  his heavy staff, \"here is the Thunder-oak; and here the cross of  Christ shall break the hammer of the false god Thor.\"    [Illustration--The sacred hammer of the god Thor]        III    THE SHADOW OF THE THUNDER-OAK      III    Withered leaves still clung to the branches of the oak: torn and  faded banners of the departed summer. The bright crimson of autumn  had long since disappeared, bleached away by the storms and the  cold. But to-night these tattered remnants of glory were red  again: ancient bloodstains against the dark-blue sky. For an  immense fire had been kindled in front of the tree. Tongues of  ruddy flame, fountains of ruby sparks, ascended through the  spreading limbs and flung a fierce illumination upward and around.  ward and around. The pale, pure moonlight that bathed the  surrounding forests was quenched and eclipsed here. Not a beam of  it sifted down-ward through the branches of the oak. It stood like  a pillar of cloud between the still light of heaven and the  crackling, flashing fire of earth.    But the fire itself was invisible to Winfried and his companions.  A great throng of people were gathered around it in a half-circle,  their backs to the open glade, their faces towards the oak. Seen  against that glowing background, it was but the silhouette of a  crowd, vague, black, formless, mysterious.    The travellers paused for a moment at the edge of the thicket, and  took counsel together.    \"It is the assembly of the tribe,\" said one of the foresters, \"the  great night of the council. I heard of it three days ago, as we  passed through one of the villages. All who swear by the old gods  have been summoned. They will sacrifice a steed to the god of war,  and drink blood, and eat horse-flesh to make them strong. It will  be at the peril of our lives if we approach them. At least we must  hide the cross, if we would escape death.\"    \"Hide me no cross,\" cried Winfried, lifting his staff, \"for I have  come to show it, and to make these blind folk see its power. There  is more to be done here to-night than the slaying of a steed, and  a greater evil to be stayed than the shameful eating of meat  sacrificed to idols. I have seen it in a dream. Here the cross  must stand and be our rede.\"    At his command the sledge was left in the border of the wood, with  two of the men to guard it, and the rest of the company moved  forward across the open ground. They approached unnoticed, for all  the multitude were looking intently towards the fire at the foot  of the oak.    Then Winfried's voice rang out, \"Hail, ye sons of the forest! A  stranger claims the warmth of your fire in the winter night.\"    Swiftly, and as with a single motion, a thousand eyes were bent  upon the speaker. The semicircle opened silently in the middle;  Winfried entered with his followers; it closed again behind them.    Then, as they looked round the curving ranks, they saw that the  hue of the assemblage was not black, but white,--dazzling,  radiant, solemn. White, the robes of the women clustered together  at the points of the wide crescent; white, the glittering byrnies  of the warriors standing in close ranks; white, the fur mantles of  the aged men who held the central place in the circle; white, with  the shimmer of silver ornaments and the purity of lamb's-wool, the  raiment of a little group of children who stood close by the fire;  white, with awe and fear, the faces of all who looked at them; and  over all the flickering, dancing radiance of the flames played and  glimmered like a faint, vanishing tinge of blood on snow.    The only figure untouched by the glow was the old priest, Hunrad,  with his long, spectral robe, flowing hair and beard, and dead-pale  face, who stood with his back to the fire and advanced slowly to  meet the strangers.    \"Who are you? Whence come you, and what seek you here?\" His voice  was heavy and toneless as a muffled bell.    \"You kinsman am I, of the German brotherhood,\" answered Winfried,  \"and from England, beyond the sea, have I come to bring you a  greeting from that land, and a message from the All-Father, whose  servant I am.\"    \"Welcome, then,\" said Hunrad, \"welcome, kinsman, and be silent;  for what passes here is too high to wait, and must be done before  the moon crosses the middle heaven, unless, indeed, thou hast some  sign or token from the gods. Canst thou work miracles?\"    The question came sharply, as if a sudden gleam of hope had  flashed through the tangle of the old priest's mind. But  Winfried's voice sank lower and a cloud of disappointment passed  over his face as he replied: \"Nay, miracles have I never wrought,  though I have heard of many; but the All-Father has given no power  to my hands save such as belongs to common man.\"    \"Stand still, then, thou common man,\" said Hunrad, scornfully,  \"and behold what the gods have called us hither to do. This night  is the death-night of the sun-god, Baldur the Beautiful, beloved  of gods and men. This night is the hour of darkness and the power  of winter, of sacrifice and mighty fear. This night the great  Thor, the god of thunder and war, to whom this oak is sacred, is  grieved for the death of Baldur, and angry with this people  because they have forsaken his worship. Long is it since an  offering has been laid upon his altar, long since the roots of his  holy tree have been fed with blood. Therefore its leaves have  withered before the time, and its boughs are heavy with death.  Therefore the Slavs and the Wends have beaten us in battle.  Therefore the harvests have failed, and the wolf-hordes have  ravaged the folds, and the strength has departed from the bow, and  the wood of the spear has broken, and the wild boar has slain the  huntsman. Therefore the plague has fallen on our dwellings, and  the dead are more than the living in all our villages. Answer me,  ye people, are not these things true?\"    A hoarse sound of approval ran through the circle. A chant, in  which the voices of the men and women blended, like the shrill  wind in the pine-trees above the rumbling thunder of a waterfall,  rose and fell in rude cadences.    O Thor, the Thunderer,  Mighty and merciless,  Spare us from smiting!  Heave not thy hammer,  Angry, against us;  Plague not thy people.  Take from our treasure  Richest of ransom.  Silver we send thee,  Jewels and javelins,  Goodliest garments,  All our possessions,  Priceless, we proffer.  Sheep will we slaughter,  Steeds will we sacrifice;  Bright blood shall bathe thee,  O tree of Thunder,  Life-floods shall lave thee,  Strong wood of wonder.  Mighty, have mercy,  Smite us no more,  Spare us and save us,  Spare us, Thor! Thor!    With two great shouts the song ended, and a stillness followed so  intense that the crackling of the fire was heard distinctly. The  old priest stood silent for a moment. His shaggy brows swept down  over his eyes like ashes quenching flame. Then he lifted his face  and spoke.    \"None of these things will please the god. More costly is the  offering that shall cleanse your sin, more precious the crimson  dew that shall send new life into this holy tree of blood. Thor  claims your dearest and your noblest gift.\"    Hunrad moved nearer to the handful of children who stood watching  the red mines in the fire and the swarms of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#3)"],[1,"busy! Pray forgive me  and permit me to have a pretty coat like the others.\"    \"You are late indeed,\" said the Father reproachfully, \"and all the  coloring has been done. You should have come when I bade you. Do you not  know that it is the prompt bird who fares best? My rainbow color-box has  been generously used, and I have but little of each tint left. Yet I  will paint you with the colors that I have, and if the result be ill you  have only yourself to blame.\"    The Father smiled gently as He took up the brush which He had laid down,  and dipped it in the first color which came to hand. This He used until  there was no more, when He began with another shade, and so continued  until the Goldfinch was completely colored from head to foot. Such a  gorgeous coat! His forehead and throat were of the most brilliant  crimson. His cap and sailor collar were black. His back was brown and  yellow, his breast white, his wings golden set off with velvet black,  and his tail was black with white-tipped feathers. Certainly there was  no danger of his being mistaken for any other bird.    When the Goldfinch looked down into a pool and saw the reflection of his  gorgeous coat, he burst out into a song of joy. \"I like it, oh, I like  it!\" he warbled, and his song was very sweet. \"Oh, I am glad that I was  late, indeed I am, dear Father!\"    But the kind Father sighed and shook His head as He put away the brush,  exclaiming, \"Poor little Goldfinch! You are indeed a beautiful bird. But  I fear that the gorgeous coat which you wear, and which is the best that  I could give you, because you came so late, will cause you more sorrow  than joy. Because of it you will be chased and captured and kept in  captivity; and your life will be spent in mourning for the days when you  were a plain gray bird.\"    And so it happened. For to this day the Goldfinch is persecuted by human  folk who admire his wonderful plumage and his beautiful song. He is  kept captive in a cage, while his less gorgeous brothers fly freely in  the beautiful world out of doors.    [Illustration: _Such a gorgeous coat!_]          KING OF THE BIRDS      Once upon a time, when the world was very new and when the birds had  just learned from Mother Magpie how to build their nests, some one said,  \"We ought to have a king. Oh, we need a king of the birds very much!\"    For you see, already in the Garden of Birds trouble had begun. There  were disputes every morning as to which was the earliest bird who was  entitled to the worm. There were quarrels over the best places for  nest-building and over the fattest bug or beetle; and there was no one  to settle these difficulties. Moreover, the robber birds were growing  too bold, and there was no one to rule and punish them. There was no  doubt about it; the birds needed a king to keep them in order and peace.    So the whisper went about, \"We must have a king. Whom shall we choose  for our king?\"    They decided to hold a great meeting for the election. And because the  especial talent of a bird is for flying, they agreed that the bird who  could fly highest up into the blue sky, straight toward the sun, should  be their king, king of all the feathered tribes of the air.    Therefore, after breakfast one beautiful morning, the birds met in the  garden to choose their king. All the birds were there, from the largest  to the smallest, chirping, twittering, singing on every bush and tree  and bit of dry grass, till the noise was almost as great as nowadays at  an election of two-legged folk without feathers. They swooped down in  great clouds, till the sky was black with them, and they were dotted on  the grass like punctuation marks on a green page. There were so many  that not even wise Mother Magpie or old Master Owl could count them, and  they all talked at the same time, like ladies at an afternoon tea, which  was very confusing.    Little Robin Redbreast was there, hopping about and saying pleasant  things to every one, for he was a great favorite. Gorgeous Goldfinch was  there, in fine feather; and little Blackbird, who was then as white as  snow. There were the proud Peacock and the silly Ostrich, the awkward  Penguin and the Dodo, whom no man living has ever seen. Likewise there  were the Jubjub Bird and the Dinky Bird, and many other curious  varieties that one never finds described in the wise Bird Books,--which  is very strange, and sad, too, I think. Yes, all the birds were there  for the choosing of their king, both the birds who could fly, and those  who could not. (But for what were they given wings, if not to fly? How  silly an Ostrich must feel!)    Now the Eagle expected to be king. He felt sure that he could fly higher  than any one else. He sat apart on a tall pine tree, looking very  dignified and noble, as a future king should look. And the birds glanced  at one another, nodded their heads, and whispered, \"He is sure to be  elected king. He can fly straight up toward the sun without winking, and  his great wings are so strong, so strong! He never grows tired. He is  sure to be king.\"    Thus they whispered among themselves, and the Eagle heard them, and was  pleased. But the little brown Wren heard also, and he was not pleased.  The absurd little bird! He wanted to be king himself, although he was  one of the tiniest birds there, who could never be a protector to the  others, nor stop trouble when it began. No, indeed! Fancy him stepping  as a peacemaker between a robber Hawk and a bloody Falcon. It was they  who would make pieces of him. But he was a conceited little creature,  and saw no reason why he should not make a noble sovereign.    \"I am cleverer than the Eagle,\" he said to himself, \"though he is so  much bigger. I will be king in spite of him. Ha-ha! We shall see what we  shall see!\" For the Wren had a great idea in his wee little head--an  idea bigger than the head itself, if you can explain how that could be.  He ruffled up his feathers to make himself as huge as possible, and  hopped over to the branch where the Eagle was sitting.    \"Well, Eagle,\" said the Wren pompously, \"I suppose you expect to be  king, eh?\"    The Eagle stared hard at him with his great bright eyes. \"Well, if I do,  what of that?\" he said. \"Who will dispute me?\"    \"I shall,\" said the Wren, bobbing his little brown head and wriggling  his tail saucily.    \"You!\" said the Eagle. \"Do _you_ expect to fly higher than I?\"    \"Yes,\" chirped the Wren, \"I do. Yes, I do, do, do!\"    \"Ho!\" said the Eagle scornfully. \"I am big and strong and brave. I can  fly higher than the clouds. You, poor little thing, are no bigger than a  bean. You will be out of breath before we have gone twice this tree's  height.\"    \"Little as I am, I can mount higher than you,\" said the Wren.    \"What will you wager, Wren?\" asked the Eagle. \"What will you give me if  I win?\"    \"If you win you will be king,\" said the Wren. \"But beside that, if you  win I will give you my fat little body to eat for your breakfast. But if  I win, Sir, I shall be king, and you must promise never, never, never,  to hurt me or any of my people.\"    \"Very well. I promise,\" said the Eagle haughtily. \"Come now, it is time  for the trial, you poor little foolish creature.\"    The birds were flapping their wings and singing eagerly, \"Let us  begin--begin. We want to see who is to be king. Come, birds, to the  trial. Who can fly the highest? Come!\"    Then the Eagle spread his great wings and mounted leisurely into the  air, straight toward the noonday sun. And after him rose a number of  other birds who wanted to be king,--the wicked Hawk, the bold Albatross,  and the Skylark singing his wonderful song. The long-legged Stork  started also, but that was only for a joke. \"Fancy me for a king!\" he  cried, and he laughed so that he had to come down again in a minute. But  the Wren was nowhere to be seen. The truth was, he had hopped ever so  lightly upon the Eagle's head, where he sat like a tiny crest. But the  Eagle did not know he was there.    Soon the Hawk and the Albatross and even the brave little Skylark fell  behind, and the Eagle began to chuckle to himself at his easy victory.  \"Where are you, poor little Wren?\" he cried very loudly, for he fancied  that the tiny bird must be left far, far below.    \"Here I am, here I am, away up above you, Master Eagle!\" piped the Wren  in a weak little voice. And the Eagle fancied the Wren was so far up in  the air that even his sharp eyes could not spy the tiny creature. \"Dear  me!\" said he to himself. \"How extraordinary that he has passed me.\" So  he redoubled his speed and flew on, higher, higher.    Presently he called out again in a tremendous voice, \"Well, where are  you now? Where are you now, poor little Wren?\"    Once more he heard the tiny shrill voice from somewhere above piping,  \"Here I am, here I am, nearer the sun than you, Master Eagle. Will you  give up now?\"    Of course the Eagle would not give up yet. He flew on, higher and  higher, till the garden and its flock of patient birds waiting for their  king grew dim and blurry below. And at last even the mighty wings of the  Eagle were weary, for he was far above the clouds. \"Surely,\" he thought,  \"now the Wren is left miles behind.\" He gave a scream of triumph and  cried, \"Where are you now, poor little Wren? Can you hear me at all,  down below there?\"    But what was his amazement to hear the same little voice above his head  shrilling, \"Here I am, here I am, Sir Eagle. Look up and see me, look!\"  And there, sure enough, he was fluttering above the Eagle's head. \"And  now, since I have mounted so much higher than you, will you agree that I  have won?\"    \"Yes, you have won, little Wren. Let us descend together, for I am weary  enough,\" cried the Eagle, much mortified; and down he swooped, on heavy,  discouraged wings.    \"Yes, let us descend together,\" murmured the Wren, once more perching  comfortably on the Eagle's head. And so down he rode on this convenient "]]]
