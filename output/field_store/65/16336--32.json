Faithful to his trust in both of these  instances, he should now have the impartial ear of the civilized world,  when he dares to speak for himself as against the infamy wherewith he  stands charged.    It is his regret, that, in his own defense, he must disclose to the world  that degree of dehumanizing brutality which fixes upon America the blot of  a national crime. Whatever faults and failings other nations may have in  their dealings with their own subjects or with other people, no other  civilized nation stands condemned before the world with a series of crimes  so peculiarly national. It becomes a painful duty of the Negro to  reproduce a record which shows that a large portion of the American people  avow anarchy, condone murder and defy the contempt of civilization. These  pages are written in no spirit of vindictiveness, for all who give the  subject consideration must concede that far too serious is the condition  of that civilized government in which the spirit of unrestrained outlawry  constantly increases in violence, and casts its blight over a continually  growing area of territory. We plead not for the colored people alone, but  for all victims of the terrible injustice which puts men and women to  death without form of law. During the year 1894, there were 132 persons  executed in the United States by due form of law, while in the same year,  197 persons were put to death by mobs who gave the victims no opportunity  to make a lawful defense. No comment need be made upon a condition of  public sentiment responsible for such alarming results.    The purpose of the pages which follow shall be to give the record which  has been made, not by colored men, but that which is the result of  compilations made by white men, of reports sent over the civilized world  by white men in the South. Out of their own mouths shall the murderers be  condemned. For a number of years the _Chicago Tribune_, admittedly one of  the leading journals of America, has made a specialty of the compilation  of statistics touching upon lynching. The data compiled by that journal  and published to the world January 1, 1894, up to the present time has not  been disputed. In order to be safe from the charge of exaggeration, the  incidents hereinafter reported have been confined to those vouched for by  the Tribune.          2    LYNCH-LAW STATISTICS      From the record published in the _Chicago Tribune_, January 1, 1894, the  following computation of lynching statistics is made referring only to the  colored victims of Lynch Law during the year 1893:    ARSON    Sept. 15, Paul Hill, Carrollton, Ala.; Sept. 15, Paul Archer, Carrollton,  Ala.; Sept. 15, William Archer, Carrollton, Ala.; Sept. 15, Emma Fair,  Carrollton, Ala.

They are not responsible for the messages that are  given them to carry. Behind the wires is the operator, the man higher  up, and upon him the responsibility falls. In functional troubles the  body is working in a perfectly normal way, considering the perverted  conditions. It is doing its work well, doing just what it is told,  obeying its master. The troubles are not with the bodily machine but  with the master. The man behind the body is in trouble and he really  has no way of showing his pain except through his body. The trouble in  nervous disorders is in the personality, the soul, the realm of ideas,  and that is not your body, but _you_. Loss of appetite may mean either  that the powers of the physical organism are busily engaged in  combating some poison circulating in the blood, or that the ego is \"up  against\" conditions for which it has \"no stomach.\" Paralysis may be  due to a hemorrhage into the brain tissues from a diseased blood  vessel, or it may symbolize a sense of inadequacy and defeat.  Exaggerated exhaustion, halting feet, stammering tongue, may give  evidence of a disturbed ego rather than of a diseased brain.    =All Body and no Mind.= At last we have begun to realize what we ought  to have known all along,--that the body is not the whole man. The  medical world for a long time has been in danger of forgetting or  ignoring psychic suffering, while it has devoted itself to the  treatment of physical disease.    By way of condoning this fault it must be recognized that the five  years of medical school have been all too short to learn what is  needed of physiology and anatomy, histology, bacteriology, and the  various other physical sciences. But at last the medical schools are  realizing that they have been sending their graduates out only  half-prepared--conversant with only one half of a patient, leaving  them to fend for themselves in discovering the ways of the other half.  Many an M.D. has gone a long way in this exploration. Native common  sense, intuition, and careful study have enabled him to go beyond what  he had learned in his text-books. But in the best universities the  present-day student of medicine is now being given an insight into the  ways of man as a whole--mind as well as body. The movement can hardly  proceed too rapidly, and when it has had time to reach its goal, the  day of the long-term sentence to nervousness will be past.    In the meanwhile most physicians, lacking such knowledge and with the  eye fixed largely on the body, have been pumping out the stomach,  prescribing lengthy rest-cures, trying massage, diet, electricity, and  surgical operations, in a vain attempt to cure a disease of the  personality. Physical measures have been given a good trial, but few  would contend that they have succeeded. Sometimes the patient has  recovered--in time--but often, apparently, despite the treatment  rather than because of it. Sometimes, in the hands of a man like Dr.  S. Weir Mitchell, results seem good, until we realize that the same  measures are ineffective when tried by other men, and that, after all,  what has counted most has been the personality of the physician rather  than his physical treatment.    No wonder that most doctors have disliked nervous cases. To a man  trained in all the exactness of the physical sciences, the apparent  lawlessness and irresponsibility of the psychic side of the  personality is especially repugnant. He is impatient of what he fails  to comprehend.    =All Mind and no Body.= This unsympathetic attitude, often only half  conscious on the part of the regular practitioners, has led many  thousands of people to follow will-o'-the-wisp cults, which pay no  attention to the findings of science, but which emphasize a  realization of man's spiritual nature. Many of these cults, founded  largely on untruth or half-falsehood, have succeeded in cases where  careful science has failed. Despite fearful blunders and execrable  lack of discrimination in attempting to cure all the ills that flesh  is heir to by methods that apply only to functional troubles, ignorant  enthusiasts and quacks have sometimes cured nervous troubles where the  conscientious medical man has had to acknowledge defeat.    =The Whole Man.= But thinking people are not willing to desert science  for cults that ignore the existence of these physical bodies. If they  have found it unsatisfactory to be treated as if they were all body,  they have also been unwilling to be treated as if they were all mind.  They have been in a dilemma between two half-truths, even if they have  not realized the dilemma. It has remained for modern psychotherapy to  strike the balance--to treat the whole man. Solidly planted on the  rock of the physical sciences, with its laboratories, physiological  and psychological, and with a long record of investigation and  treatment of pathological cases, it resembles the mind cure of earlier  days or the assertions of Christian Science about as much as modern  medicine resembles the old bloodletting, leeching practices of our  forefathers.    For the last quarter-century there have been scattered groups of  physicians,--brilliant, patient pioneers,--who, recognizing man as  spirit inhabiting body, have explored the realm of man's mind and  charted its paths. These pioneers, beginning with Charcot, have been  men of acknowledged scientific training and spirit, whose word must be  respected and whose success in treating functional troubles stands out  in sharp contrast to the fumblings of the average practitioner in this  field. The results of their work have been positive, not negative.  They have not merely asserted that nervous disorders are not physical;  they have discovered what the trouble is and have found it to be  discoverable and removable in almost every case, provided only that  the right method is used.    =Ourselves and Our Bodies.= If the statement that \"nervous troubles  are neither physical nor imaginary but a disease of the personality,\"  sounds rather mystifying to the average person, it is only because the  average person is not very conversant with his own inner life. We  shall hope, later on, to find some definite guide-posts and landmarks  which will help us feel more at home in this fascinating realm. At  present, we are not attempting anything more than a suggestion of the  itinerary which we shall follow. A book on physical hygiene can  presuppose at least a rudimentary knowledge of heart and lungs and  circulation, but a book on mental hygiene must begin at the beginning,  and even before the beginning must clear away misconceptions and make  clear certain fundamental principles. But the gist of the whole matter  is this: in a neurosis, certain forces of the personality--instincts  and their accompanying emotions--which ought to work harmoniously,  having become tangled up with some erroneous ideas, have lost their  power of cooeperation and are working at cross purposes, leaving the  individual mis-adapted to his environment, the prey of all sorts of  mental and physical disturbances.    The fact that the cause is mental while the result is often physical,  should cause no surprise. In the physiological realm we are used to  the idea that cause and effect are often widely separated. A headache  may be caused by faulty eyes, or it may result from trouble in the  intestines. In the same way, we should not be too much surprised if  the cause of nervous troubles is found to be even more remote,  provided there is some connecting link between cause and effect. The  difficulty in this case is the apparent gulf between the realm of the  spirit and the realm of the body. It is hard to see how an intangible  thing like a thought can produce a pain in the arm or nausea in the  stomach. Philosophers are still arguing concerning the nature of the  relation between mind and body, but no one denies that the closest  relation does exist. Every year science is learning that ideas count  and that they count physically, as well as spiritually.    =Such Stuff as \"Nerves\" are Made Of.= Dr. Tom A. Williams in the  little composite volume \"Psychotherapeutics\" says that the neuroses  are based not on inherently weak nervous constitutions but on  ignorance and on false ideas. What, then, are some of these erroneous  ideas, these misconceptions, that cause so much trouble? We shall want  to examine them more carefully in later chapters, but we might glance  now at a few examples of these popular bugaboos that need to be slain  by the sword of cold, hard fact.    =Popular Misconceptions about the Body.=    1 \"Eight hours' sleep is essential to health. All insomnia is  dangerous and is incompatible with health. Nervous insomnia leads to  shattered nerves and ultimately to insanity.\"    2 \"Overwork leads to nervous breakdown. Fatigue accumulates from day  to day and necessitates a long rest for recuperation.\"    3 \"A carefully planned diet is essential to health, especially for the  nervous person. A variety of food, eaten at the same time, is harmful.  Acid and milk--for example, oranges and milk--are difficult to digest.  Sour stomach is a sign of indigestion.\"    4 \"Modern life is so strenuous that our nerves cannot stand the  strain.\"    5 \"Brain work is very fatiguing. It causes brain-fag and exhaustion.\"    6 \"Constipation is at the root of most physical ailments and is  caused by eating the wrong kind of food.\"    Some of these misconceptions are household words and are so all but  universally believed that the thought that they can be challenged is  enough to bewilder one. However, it is ideas like this that furnish  the material out of which many a nervous trouble is made. Based on a  half-knowledge of the human body, on logical conclusions from faulty  premises, on hastily swallowed notions passed on from one person to  another, they tend by the very power of an idea to work themselves out  to fulfilment.
