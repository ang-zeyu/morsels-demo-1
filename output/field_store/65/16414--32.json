As I  have said, his method was that taught at the Ecole Niedermeuer. Faure,  Messager, Perilhou, and Gigot were trained there and they taught this  method in turn. My class-work consisted in making attempts at vocal and  instrumental music and orchestration. My _Reverie_, _La Feuille de  Peuplier_ and many other things first appeared there. They have been  entirely forgotten, and rightly, for my work was very uneven.    At the end of his career Halevy was constantly writing opera and  opera-comique which added nothing to his fame and which disappeared  never to be revived after a respectable number of performances. He was  entirely absorbed in his work and, as a result, he neglected his classes  a good deal. He came only when he had time. The pupils, however, came  just the same and gave each other instruction which was far less  indulgent than the master's, for his greatest fault was an overweening  good nature. Even when he was at class he couldn't protect himself from  self-seekers. Singers of all sorts, male and female, came for a hearing.  One day it was Marie Cabel, still youthful and dazzling both in voice  and beauty. Other days impossible tenors wasted his time. When the  master sent word that he wasn't coming--this happened often--I used to  go to the library, and there, as a matter of fact, I completed my  education. The amount of music, ancient and modern, I devoured is beyond  belief.    But it wasn't enough just to read music--I needed to hear it. Of course  there was the Societe des Concerts, but it was a Paradise, guarded by an  angel with a flaming sword, in the form of a porter named Lescot. It was  his duty to prevent the profane defiling the sanctuary. Lescot was fond  of me and appreciated my keen desire to hear the orchestra. As a result  he made his rounds as slowly as possible in order to put me out only as  a last resort. Fortunately for me, Marcelin de Fresne gave me a place in  his box, which I was permitted to occupy for several years.    I used to read and study the symphonies before I heard them and I saw  grave defects in the Societe's vaunted execution. No one would stand  them now, but then they passed unnoticed. I was naive and lacked  discretion, and so I often pointed out these defects. It can be easily  imagined what vials of wrath were poured on me.    As far as the public was concerned, the great success of these concerts  was due to the incomparable charm of the depth of tone, which was  attributed to the hall. The members of the Societe believed this, too,  and they would let no other orchestra be heard there. This state of  affairs lasted until Anton Rubinstein got permission from the Minister  of Fine Arts to give a concert there, accompanied by the Colonne  orchestra. The Societe fretted and fumed at this and threatened to give  up its series of concerts. But the Societe was overruled and the concert  was given. To the general surprise it was seen that another orchestra in  the same hall produced an entirely different effect. The depth of tone  which had been appreciated so highly, it was found, was due to the  famous Societe itself, to the character of the instruments and the  execution.    Nevertheless, the hall is excellent, although it is no longer adequate  for the presentation of modern compositions. But it is a marvellous  place for the numerous concerts given by virtuosi, both singers and  instrumentalists, accompanied by an orchestra, and for chamber music.  Finally, the hall where France was introduced to the masterpieces of  Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, whose influence has been so profound, is a  historic place.    Numerous improvements in the administration of the Conservatoire have  been introduced during the last few years. On the other hand, old and  honored customs have disappeared and we can but regret their loss. From  Auber's time on there was a _pension_ connected with the Conservatoire.  Here the young singers who came from the provinces at eighteen found  board and lodging, a regular life, and a protection from the temptations  of a large city, so dangerous to fresh young voices. Bouhy, Lassalle,  Capoul, Gailhard and many others who have made the French stage famous  came from this _pension_.    We also used to have dramatic recitals which were excellent both for the  performers and the audiences as they gave works which were not in the  usual repertoire. In these recitals they gave Mehul's _Joseph_, which  had disappeared from the stage for a long time. The beautiful choruses  sung by the fresh voices of the pupils made such a success and the whole  work was so enthusiastically applauded that it was revived at the  Opera-Comique and won back a success which it has never lost. We also  heard there Gluck's _Orphee_ long before that masterpiece was revived at  the Theatre-Lyrique. Then there was Mehul's _Irato_, a curious and  charming work which the Opera took up afterwards. And there, too, they  gave the last act of Rossini's _Otello_. The tempest in that act gave me  the idea of the one which rumbles through the second act of _Samson_.    When the hall was reconstructed, the stage was destroyed so that such  performances are impossible. But to make up for this, they installed a  concert organ, a necessary adjunct for musical performances.    Finally, in Auber's day and even in that of Ambroise Thomas, the  director was master. No one had dreamed of creating a committee, which,  under cover of the director's responsibility, would strangely diminish  his authority. The only benefit from the new system has been the end of  the incessant war which the musical critics waged on the director. But  that did no harm, either to the director or to the school, for the  latter kept on growing to such an extent that it ought to have been  enlarged long ago. The committee plan has won and the incident is  closed. One may only hope that steps will be taken to make possible an  increase in the number of pupils since so many candidates apply each  year and so few are chosen.    As everyone knows, we have been struck by a perfect mania for reforms,  so there is no harm in proposing one for the Conservatoire. Foreign  conservatoires have been studied and they want to introduce some of  their features here. As a matter of fact, some of the foreign  conservatoires are housed in magnificent palaces and their curricula are  elaborated with a care worthy of admiration. Whether they turn out  better pupils than we do is an open question. It is beyond dispute,  however, that many young foreigners come to us for their education.    Some of the reformers are scandalized at the sight of a musician in  charge of a school where elocution is taught. They forget that a  musician may also be a man of letters--the present director combines  these qualifications--and that it is improbable that it will be  different in the future. The teachers of elocution have always been the  best that could be found. Although M. Faure is a musician, he has known  how to bring back the classes in tragedy to their original purpose. For  a time they tended towards an objectionable modernism, for they  substituted in their competitions modern prose for the classic verse.  And the study of the latter is very profitable.    Not only is there no harm in this union of elocution and music, but it  would be useful if singers and composers would take advantage of it to  familiarize themselves with the principles of diction, which, in my  opinion, are indispensable to both. Instead, they distrust melody.  Declamation is no longer wanted in operas, and the singers make the  works incomprehensible by not articulating the words. The composers tend  along the same lines, for they give no indication or direction of how  they want the words spoken. All this is regrettable and should be  reformed.    As you see, I object to the mania for reform and end by suggesting  reforms myself. Well, one must be of one's own time, and there is no  escaping the contagion.          CHAPTER III    VICTOR HUGO      Everything in my youth seemed calculated to keep me far removed from  romanticism. Those about me talked only of the great classics and I saw  them welcome Ponsard's _Lucrece_ as a sort of Minerva whose lance was to  route Victor Hugo and his foul crew, of whom they never spoke save with  detestation.    Who was it, I wonder, who had the happy idea of giving me, elegantly  bound, the first volumes of Victor Hugo's poems? I have forgotten who it  was, but I remember what joy the vibrations of his lyre gave me. Until  that time poetry had seemed to me something cold, respectable and  far-away, and it was much later that the living beauty of our classics  was revealed to me. I found myself at once stirred to the depths, and,  as my temperament is essentially musical in everything, I began to sing  them.    People have told me _ad nauseam_ (and they still tell me so) that  beautiful verse is inimical to music, or rather that music is inimical  to good verse; that music demands ordinary verse, rhymed prose, rather  than verse, which is malleable and reducible as the composer wishes.  This generalization is assuredly true, if the music is written first and  then adapted to the words, but that is not the ideal harmony between two  arts which are made to supplement each other. Do not the rhythmic and  sonorous passages of verse naturally call for song to set them off,  since singing is but a better method of declaiming them? I made some  attempts at this and some of those which have been preserved are:  _Puisque ici bas toute ame_, _Le Pas d'armes du roi Jean_, and _La  Cloche_. They were ridiculed at the time, but destined to some success  later. Afterwards I continued with _Si tu veux faisons un reve_, which  Madame Carvalho sang a good deal, _Soiree en mer_, and many others.    The older I grew the greater became my devotion to Hugo. I waited  impatiently "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#3)"],[1," uneasy on account of the great  decrease in the amount of public revenues, but it did not worry them for  any great length of time. They met the situation by imposing a tax of  eight shillings upon every one of the thousands of natives who returned  from the mines to their homes in Portuguese territory. About the same time  the Uitlanders from the Transvaal reached Lorenzo Marques, and, in order  to calm the Portuguese mind, every one of the thousands of men and women  who took part in that exodus was compelled to pay a transit tax, ranging  from eight shillings to a sovereign, according to the size of the tip  tendered to the official.    When the van of the foreign volunteers reached the port there was a new  situation to be dealt with, and again the principle of \"When in doubt  impose a tax\" was satisfactorily employed. Men who had just arrived in  steamers, and who had never seen Portuguese territory, were obliged to  secure a certificate, indicating that they had not been inhabitants of the  local jail during the preceding six months; a certificate from the  consular representative of their country, showing that they possessed good  characters; another from the Governor-General to show that they did not  purpose going into the Transvaal to carry arms; a fourth from the local  Transvaal consul to indicate that he held no objections to the traveller's  desire to enter the Boer country; and one or two other passports equally  weighty in their bearing on the subject were necessary before a person was  able to leave the town. Each one of these certificates was to be secured  only upon the payment of a certain number of thousand reis and at an  additional expenditure of time and nervous energy, for none of the  officials could speak a word of any language except Portuguese, and all  the applicants were men of other nationalities and tongues. The  expenditure in connection with the certificates was more than a sovereign  for every person, and as there were thousands of travellers into the Boer  countries while the war continued the revenues of the Government were  correspondingly great. To crown it all, the Portuguese imposed the same  tax upon all travellers who came into the country from the Transvaal with  the intention of sailing to other ports. The Government could not be  charged with favouritism in the matter of taxation, for every man, woman,  and child who stepped on Portuguese soil was similarly treated. There was  no charge for entering the country, but the jail yawned for him who  refused to pay when leaving it.    Not unlike the patriots in Cape Town and Durban, the hotel and shopkeepers  of Lorenzo Marques took advantage of the presence of many strangers and  made extraordinary efforts to secure the residue of the money which did  not fall into the coffers of the Government. At the Cardoza Hotel, the  only establishment worthy of the name, a tax of a sovereign was levied for  sleeping on a bare floor; drivers of street cabs scorned any amount less  than a golden sovereign for carrying one passenger to the consulates;  lemonades were two shillings each at the kiosks; and physicians charged  three pounds a call when travellers remained in the town several days and  contracted the deadly coast-fever. At the Custom House duties of ten  shillings were levied upon foreign flags, unless the officer was liberally  tipped, in which event it was not necessary to open the luggage. It was a  veritable harvest for every one who chose to take advantage of the  opportunities offered, and there were but few who did not make the  foreigners their victims.    The blockade by the British warships placed a premium upon dishonesty, and  of those who gained most by it the majority were British subjects. The  vessels which succeeded in passing the blockading warships were invariably  consigned to Englishmen, and without exception these were unpatriotic  enough to sell the supplies to agents employed by the Transvaal  Government. Just as Britons sold guns and ammunition to the Boers before  the war, these men of the same nation made exorbitant profits on supplies  which were necessary to the burgher army. Lorenzo Marques was filled with  men who were taking advantage of the state of affairs to grow wealthy by  means which were not legitimate, and the leaders in almost every  enterprise of that nature were British subjects, although there were not a  few Germans, Americans, and Frenchmen who succeeded in making the fortunes  they deserved for remaining in such a horrible pest-hole as Lorenzo  Marques.    The railroad from Lorenzo Marques to Ressana Garcia, at the Transvaal  border, was interesting only from the fact that it was more historical  than comfortable for travelling purposes. As the train passed through the  dry, dusty, and uninteresting country, which was even too poor and  unhealthy for the blacks, the mind speculated upon the proposition whether  the Swiss judges who decided the litigation concerning the road would have  spent ten years in making a decision if they had been compelled to conduct  their deliberation within sight of the railway. The land adjoining the  railroad was level, well timbered and well watered, and the vast tracts of  fine grass give the impression that it might be an excellent country for  farming, but it was in the belt known as the fever district, and white men  avoided it as they would a cholera-infested city. Shortly before the train  arrived at the English river several lofty white-stone pyramids on either  side of the railway were passed, and the Transvaal was reached. A long  iron bridge spanning the river was crossed, and the train reached the  first station in the Boer country, Koomatipoort.    Courteous Boer officials entered the train and requested the passengers to  disembark with all their luggage, for the purpose of custom-examination.  No gratuities were accepted there, as at Lorenzo Marques, and nothing  escaped the vigilance of the bearded inspectors. Trunks and luggage were  carefully scrutinised, letters read line by line and word for word;  revolvers and ammunition promptly confiscated if not declared; and even  the clothing of the passengers was faithfully examined. Passports were  closely investigated, and, when all appeared to be thoroughly  satisfactory, a white cross was chalked on the boots of the passengers,  and they were free to proceed farther inland. The field-cornet of the  district was one of the few Boers at the station, and he performed the  duties of his office by introducing himself to certain passengers whom he  believed to be foreign volunteers, and offering them gratuitous railway  tickets to Pretoria. No effort was made to conceal the fact that the  volunteers were welcome in the country, and nothing was left undone to  make the foreigners realise that their presence was appreciated.    After Koomatipoort was passed the train crept slowly into the mountainous  district, where huge peaks pierced the clouds and gigantic boulders  overhung the tracks. Narrow defiles stretched away in all directions and  the sounds of cataracts in the Crocodile River flowing alongside the iron  path drowned the roar of the train. Flowering, vari-coloured plants, huge  cacti, and thick tropical vegetation lined the banks of the river, and  occasionally the thatched roof of a negro's hut peered out over the  undergrowth, to indicate that a few human beings chose that wild region  for their abode. Hour after hour the train crept along narrow ledges up  the mountains' sides, then dashed down declines and out upon small level  plains which, with their surrounding and towering eminences, had the  appearance of vast green bowls. In that impregnable region lay the small  town of Machadodorp, which, later, became the capital of the Transvaal. A  few houses of corrugated iron, a pretty railway-station, and much scenery,  serves as a worthy description of the town at the junction of the purposed  railway to the gold-fields of Lydenberg.    After a journey of twelve hours through the fever country the train  reached the western limit of that belt and rested for the night in a  small, green, cup-shaped valley bearing the descriptive name of Waterval  Onder--\"under the waterfall.\" The weary passengers found more corrugated  iron buildings and the best hotel in South Africa. The host, Monsieur  Mathis, a French Boer, and his excellent establishment came as a breath of  fresh air to a stifling traveller on the desert, and long will they live  in the memories of the thousands of persons who journeyed over the  railroad during the war. After the monotonous fare of an east-coast  steamer and the mythical meals of a Lorenzo Marques hotel, the roast  venison, the fresh milk and eggs of Mathis were as welcome as the odour of  the roses that filled the valley.    The beginning of the second day's journey was characterised by a ride up  and along the sides of a magnificent gorge through which the waters of the  Crocodile River rushed from the lofty plateau of the high veld to the  wildernesses of the fever country and filled that miniature South African  Switzerland with myriads of rainbows. A long, curved, and inclined tunnel  near the top of the mountain led to the undulating plains of the  Transvaal--a marvellously rapid transition from a region filled with  nature's wildest panoramas to one that contained not even a tree or rock  or cliff to relieve the monotony of the landscape. On the one side of this  natural boundary line was an immense territory every square mile of which  contained mountain passes which a handful of Boers could hold against an  invading army; on the other side there was hardly a rock behind which a  burgher rifleman could conceal himself. Here herds of cattle and flocks of  sheep, instead of wild beasts, sped away from the roar of the train; here  there was the daub and wattle cottage of the farmer instead of the  thatched hut of the native savage.
