Avoid getting the hand in an awkward or tiresome position, rolling it  over to one side, or drawing the fore finger up into a crooked shape.  Hold the pen firmly but lightly, not with a grip as if it were about  to escape from service. Do not say, \"I can't\" hold the pen correctly.  Habits are strong, but will may be stronger, and if you hold the pen  correctly in spite of old habits, for a few lessons, all will then  be easy, and the pen will take its position at each writing exercise,  with no effort whatever. Everything being in readiness, and the proper  position assumed, the writer must now obtain complete control of hand  and pen, by practice in movement.    [Illustration]      RAPIDITY.    One of the essentials of a practical business style of writing must be  rapidity of execution, in order to be of any avail in the necessities  and press of a business position. The demand of the merchant is, that  his clerk shall not only write well, but with rapidity, and the  volume of letters to be answered, bills to be made out, or items to be  entered on the books of account, compel the clerk to move the pen  with dexterity and rapidity, as well as skill. While there is great  diversity among persons as to the rapidity as well as quality of their  penmanship, some being naturally more alert and active than others,  yet by securing the proper position of the hand, arm and body,  favorable to ease and freedom of execution, then following this with  careful practice in movement, until all the varied motions necessary  in writing are thoroughly mastered, the person may, with suitable  effort, acquire the quality of rapidity in writing, gradually  increasing the speed until the desired rate is accomplished.      BEAUTY.    In the handwriting, as in other things, beauty is largely a matter  of taste and education. To the man of business, the most beautiful  handwriting is that which is written with ease, and expresses plainly  and neatly the thought of the writer. To the professional or artistic  taste, while such a hand may be regarded as \"a good business hand,\" it  would not be considered as beautiful, because it conforms to no rule  as to proportion, shade, and spacing. In the practical art of writing,  it is not very unfair to measure its beauty largely by its utility.          [Illustration: Movement]    MOVEMENT.      Finger movement, or writing by the use of the fingers as the motive  power, is entirely inadequate to the requirements of business. The  fingers soon become tired, the hand becomes cramped, the writing shows  a labored effort, and lacks freedom and ease so essential to good  business penmanship. In the office or counting-room, where the clerk  or correspondent must write from morning till night, the finger  movement of course cannot be used.    What is designated by writing teachers as the Whole Arm, or Free Arm  Movement, in which the arm is lifted free from the desk and completes  the letter with a dash or a swoop, is necessary in ornamental  penmanship and flourishing, but has no place in a practical style of  business writing. The man of business would hardly stop, in the midst  of his writing, to raise the arm, and execute an \"off-hand capital,\"  while customers are waiting.    But adapted to the practical purposes of business is the _muscular  movement_, in which the arm moves freely on the muscles below the  elbow, and in cases of precise writing, or in the more extended  letters, such as f, is assisted by a slight movement of the fingers.  The third and fourth fingers may remain stationary on the paper,  and be moved from time to time, or between words, where careful and  accurate writing is desired, but in more rapid, free and flowing  penmanship, the fingers should slide over the paper.      MOVEMENT EXERCISES.    Having everything in readiness, the student may begin his practice on  movement exercises, the object of which is to obtain control of the  pen and train the muscles. Circular motion, as in the capital O,  reversed as in the capital W, vertical movement as in f, long s and  capital J, and the lateral motion as in small letters, must each be  practiced in order to be able to move the pen in any direction, up,  down, or sidewise.    The simplest exercise in movement. Try to follow around in the same  line as nearly as possible. Do not shade.    [Illustration: O O 8]    The same exercise, only with ovals drawn out and and slight shade  added to each down stroke.    [Illustration: (coils)]    Sides of ovals should be even, forming as nearly a straight line as  possible. Reverse the movement as in third form.    [Illustration: (coils)]    The following three exercises embrace the essential elements in capital  letters, and should at first be made large for purposes of movement:    Capital O, down strokes parallel.    [Illustration: O Q O Q O O Q O Q O]    Capital stem. Down stroke a compound curve. Shade low. Finish with a  dash.    [Illustration: d d d d d d d d d]    Capital loop. Curves parallel. First curve highest.    [Illustration: O O O O (double overlapping loops)]    Having succeeded to some extent with these exercises, the learner may  next undertake the vertical movement. In order to obtain the lateral  movement, which enables one to write long words without lifting the  pen, and move easily and gracefully across the page, exercises like  the following should be practiced:    Down strokes straight. Even and resting on line.    [Illustration: uuuuuuuuuuu]    In all movement exercises the third and fourth fingers should slide  on the paper, and the finger movement should be carefully avoided. The  different movements having been practiced, they may now be combined in  various forms.    [Illustration: u u u u u n n n n n]    Lateral and rolling movement combined. Vertical movement and rolling  movement combined.    [Illustration: t t t]    Do not shade the circles. Lines should be parallel.    Movement exercises may be multiplied almost indefinitely by studying  the forms used in writing and their combinations. Repeating many of  the small letters, such as m, u, e, r, s, a, d, h and c, also capitals  D, J, P, etc., forms an excellent exercise for the learner.      PRINCIPLES IN WRITING.    In order to enable the learner to examine, analyze and criticise  his writing, the following principles are given as his standards of  measurements and form. By combining them in various ways the essential  part of all letters in the alphabet may be formed.    [Illustration: (eight common strokes)]    The principles must be first carefully studied, and separated into the  primary lines which compose them and the form of each principle well  understood. The student may then form a scale like the one following, by  dividing the distance between the blue lines on the paper into four  equal spaces, with a lightly ruled line. The letters of the small  alphabet should then be placed in the scale and the [Transcriber's Note:  The original text reads 'hight'] height of each letter fixed in the  mind.    [Illustration: (lowercase cursive alphabet)]    Notice that the contracted letters, or those which occupy only one  space, as a, m, n, o, s, v, w and e, and that part of d, g, h, q and  y, found in the first space, are all well rounded and developed.  These letters and parts of letters, found in the first space, form the  essential part of all writing, and therefore deserve especial care.  Also notice that the loop letters, above the line, such as b, f, h, k  and l, extend two and one-half spaces above the blue line, while  the loop below the line, such as g, f, j, q, y and z, extend one and  one-half spaces below the blue line, thus two and one-half and one and  one-half making the four spaces of the scale, and the upper loops on  one line will just meet the lower loops of the line above, but never  conflict, to the destruction of neat body writing. Notice the type  of the printer. The extensions above the shorter letters are quite  insignificant, and are only used to save the letter from resembling  some other letter of the alphabet. They never conflict, and how  legible they are.    [Illustration: The Types. A Resemblance. An Absurdity.]    Besides, to make long loops, requires more time, and more power with  the pen, while shorter loops are in every way easier to acquire,  quicker, and better. Telegraph operators, some of whom are among our  best business penmen, make all extended letters very short, while  accountants, and business men, favor the style of short loops, well  developed letters, and small capitals.    Apply the principles. Observe regularity. Muscular movement.    [Illustration: (v and u strokes)]    Down strokes straight. Up strokes curved.    [Illustration: (n and m strokes)]    Principle No. 1. Well formed loop.    [Illustration: (e and c strokes)]    These exercises should be practiced with the muscular movement, until  they can be made with regularity and ease.    4th principle. Let 3d and 4th fingers slide. Notice the top.    [Illustration: (s and r strokes)]    O closed at top. No retracing.    [Illustration: (o and a strokes)]    Two spaces high. Down stroke straight.    [Illustration: (l and d strokes)]    A rule in writing may be laid down, that all small letters should  commence on the blue line, and end one space high.    Discover the principles. Avoid retracing.    [Illustration: (g and q strokes)]    Notice form. In w, last part narrow. Make without raising the pen.    [Illustration: (v, w, and x strokes)]    Extend two spaces above the line, and one below.    [Illustration: p p pppppp pump paper prepared pen]    Retracing is an error. The only exception to this is in d, t, p and x,  where it becomes [Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'neccessary']  necessary.

After they had performed several suites of Graziani, and  finished as usual with the \"Areopagita,\" Mr. Gaskell sat for a time  silent at the instrument, as though thinking with himself, and then  said--    \"I cannot say how deeply this old-fashioned music affects me. Some would  try to persuade us that these suites, of which the airs bear the names  of different dances, were always written rather as a musical essay and  for purposes of performance than for persons to dance to, as their names  would more naturally imply. But I think these critics are wrong at least  in some instances. It is to me impossible to believe that such a melody,  for instance, as the _Giga_ of Corelli which we have played, was not  written for actual purposes of dancing. One can almost hear the beat  of feet upon the floor, and I imagine that in the time of Corelli the  practice of dancing, while not a whit inferior in grace, had more of the  tripudistic or beating character than is now esteemed consistent with a  correct ball-room performance. The _Gagliarda_ too, which we play now so  constantly, possesses a singular power of assisting the imagination to  picture or reproduce such scenes as those which it no doubt formerly  enlivened. I know not why, but it is constantly identified in my mind  with some revel which I have perhaps seen in a picture, where several  couples are dancing a licentious measure in a long room lit by a number  of silver sconces of the debased model common at the end of the  seventeenth century. It is probably a reminiscence of my late excursion  that gives to these dancers in my fancy the olive skin, dark hair, and  bright eyes of the Italian type; and they wear dresses of exceedingly  rich fabric and elaborate design. Imagination is whimsical enough to  paint for me the character of the room itself, as having an arcade of  arches running down one side alone, of the fantastic and paganised  Gothic of the Renaissance. At the end is a gallery or balcony for the  musicians, which on its coved front has a florid coat of arms of foreign  heraldry. The shield bears, on a field _or_, a cherub's head blowing on  three lilies--a blazon I have no doubt seen somewhere in my travels,  though I cannot recollect where. This scene, I say, is so nearly  connected in my brain with the _Gagliarda_, that scarcely are its first  notes sounded ere it presents itself to my eyes with a vividness which  increases every day. The couples advance, set, and recede, using free  and licentious gestures which my imagination should be ashamed to  recall. Amongst so many foreigners, fancy pictures, I know not in the  least why, the presence of a young man of an English type of face, whose  features, however, always elude my mind's attempt to fix them. I think  that the opening subject of this _Gagliarda_ is a superior composition  to the rest of it, for it is only during the first sixteen bars that the  vision of bygone revelry presents itself to me. With the last note of  the sixteenth bar a veil is drawn suddenly across the scene, and with a  sense almost of some catastrophe it vanishes. This I attribute to the  fact that the second subject must be inferior in conception to the  first, and by some sense of incongruity destroys the fabric which the  fascination of the preceding one built up.\"    My brother, though he had listened with interest to what Mr. Gaskell had  said, did not reply, and the subject was allowed to drop.          CHAPTER III      It was in the same summer of 1842, and near the middle of June, that my  brother John wrote inviting me to come to Oxford for the Commemoration  festivities. I had been spending some weeks with Mrs. Temple, a distant  cousin of ours, at their house of Royston in Derbyshire, and John was  desirous that Mrs. Temple should come up to Oxford and chaperone  her daughter Constance and myself at the balls and various other  entertainments which take place at the close of the summer term. Owing  to Royston being some two hundred miles from Worth Maltravers, our  families had hitherto seen little of one another, but during my present  visit I had learned to love Mrs. Temple, a lady of singular sweetness of  disposition, and had contracted a devoted attachment to her daughter  Constance. Constance Temple was then eighteen years of age, and to great  beauty united such mental graces and excellent traits of character as  must ever appear to reasoning persons more enduringly valuable than even  the highest personal attractions. She was well read and witty, and had  been trained in those principles of true religion which she afterwards  followed with devoted consistency in the self-sacrifice and resigned  piety of her too short life. In person, I may remind you, my dear  Edward, since death removed her ere you were of years to appreciate  either her appearance or her qualities, she was tall, with a somewhat  long and oval face, with brown hair and eyes.    Mrs. Temple readily accepted Sir John Maltravers' invitation. She had  never seen Oxford herself, and was pleased to afford us the pleasure of  so delightful an excursion. John had secured convenient rooms for us  above the shop of a well-known printseller in High Street, and we  arrived in Oxford on Friday evening, June 18, 1842. I shall not dilate  to you on the various Commemoration festivities, which have probably  altered little since those days, and with which you are familiar.  Suffice it to say that my brother had secured us admission to every  entertainment, and that we enjoyed our visit as only youth with its keen  sensibilities and uncloyed pleasures can. I could not help observing  that John was very much struck by the attractions of Miss Constance  Temple, and that she for her part, while exhibiting no unbecoming  forwardness, certainly betrayed no aversion to him. I was greatly  pleased both with my own powers of observation which had enabled me to  discover so important a fact, and also with the circumstance itself.  To a romantic girl of nineteen it appeared high time that a brother of  twenty-two should be at least preparing some matrimonial project; and my  friend was so good and beautiful that it seemed impossible that I should  ever obtain a more lovable sister or my brother a better wife. Mrs.  Temple could not refuse her sanction to such a scheme; for while their  mental qualities seemed eminently compatible, John was in his own right  master of Worth Maltravers, and her daughter sole heiress of the Royston  estates.    The Commemoration festivities terminated on Wednesday night with a grand  ball at the Music-Room in Holywell Street. This was given by a Lodge of  University Freemasons, and John was there with Mr. Gaskell--whose  acquaintance we had made with much gratification--both wearing blue silk  scarves and small white aprons. They introduced us to many other of  their friends similarly adorned, and these important and mysterious  insignia sat not amiss with their youthful figures and boyish faces.  After a long and pleasurable programme, it was decided that we should  prolong our visit till the next evening, leaving Oxford at half-past  ten o'clock at night and driving to Didcot, there to join the mail for  the west. We rose late the next morning and spent the day rambling among  the old colleges and gardens of the most beautiful of English cities.  At seven o'clock we dined together for the last time at our lodgings  in High Street, and my brother proposed that before parting we should  enjoy the fine evening in the gardens of St. John's College. This was  at once agreed to, and we proceeded thither, John walking on in front  with Constance and Mrs. Temple, and I following with Mr. Gaskell. My  companion explained that these gardens were esteemed the most beautiful  in the University, but that under ordinary circumstances it was not  permitted to strangers to walk there of an evening. Here he quoted some  Latin about \"aurum per medios ire satellites,\" which I smilingly made as  if I understood, and did indeed gather from it that John had bribed the  porter to admit us. It was a warm and very still night, without a moon,  but with enough of fading light to show the outlines of the garden  front. This long low line of buildings built in Charles I's reign looked  so exquisitely beautiful that I shall never forget it, though I have not  since seen its oriel windows and creeper-covered walls. There was a very  heavy dew on the broad lawn, and we walked at first only on the paths.  No one spoke, for we were oppressed by the very beauty of the scene, and  by the sadness which an imminent parting from friends and from so sweet  a place combined to cause. John had been silent and depressed the whole  day, nor did Mr. Gaskell himself seem inclined to conversation.  Constance and my brother fell a little way behind, and Mr. Gaskell asked  me to cross the lawn if I was not afraid of the dew, that I might see  the garden front to better advantage from the corner. Mrs. Temple waited  for us on the path, not wishing to wet her feet. Mr. Gaskell pointed out  the beauties of the perspective as seen from his vantage-point, and we  were fortunate in hearing the sweet descant of nightingales for which  this garden has ever been famous. As we stood silent and listening, a  candle was lit in a small oriel at the end, and the light showing the  tracery of the window added to the picturesqueness of the scene.    Within an hour we were in a landau driving through the still warm lanes  to Didcot. I had seen that Constance's parting with my brother had been  tender, and I am not sure that she was not in tears during some part at  least of our drive; but I did not observe her closely, having my  thoughts elsewhere.    Though we were thus being carried every moment further from the sleeping  city, where I believe that both our hearts were busy, I feel as if I had"]]]
