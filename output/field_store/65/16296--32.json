At the time when Nimrod the wicked had cast our Father Abraham into the  fiery furnace, Gabriel stood forth in the presence of the Holy  One--blessed be He!--and said, \"Lord of the universe, let me, I pray  thee, go down and cool the furnace, and deliver that righteous one from  it.\" Then the Holy One--blessed be He!--said unto him, \"I am One in my  world and he is one in his world; it is more becoming that He who is one  should deliver him who is one.\" But as God does not withhold His reward  from any creature, He said to Gabriel, \"For this thy good intention, be  thine the honor of rescuing three of his descendants.\" At the time when  Nebuchadnezzar the wicked cast Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah into the  fiery furnace, Yourkami, the prince of hail, arose before God and said,  \"Lord of the universe, let me, I pray thee, go down and cool the fiery  furnace, and rescue these righteous men from its fury.\" Whereupon  Gabriel interposed, and said, \"God's power is not to be demonstrated  thus, for thou art the prince of hail, and everybody knows that water  quenches fire; but I, the prince of fire, will go down and cool the  flame within and intensify it without (so as to consume the  executioners), and thus will I perform a miracle within a miracle.\" Then  the Holy One--blessed be He!--said to him, \"Go down.\" Upon which Gabriel  exclaimed, \"Verily the truth of the Lord endureth forever!\" (Ps. cxvii.  2.)    _P'sachim_, fol. 118, col. 1.    One peppercorn to-day is better than a basketful of pumpkins to-morrow.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 10, col. 1.    One day of a year is counted for a whole year.    _Rosh Hashanah_, fol. 2, col. 2.        If a king be crowned on the twenty-ninth of Adar (the last month      of the Sacred year), on the morrow--the first of Nissan--it is      reckoned that he commences his second year, that being the new      year's day for royal and ecclesiastical affairs.    For the sake of one righteous man the whole world is preserved in  existence, as it is written (Prov. x. 25), \"The righteous man is an  everlasting foundation.\"    _Yoma_, fol. 38, col. 2.    Rabbi Meyer saith, \"Great is repentance, because for the sake of one  that truly repenteth the whole world is pardoned; as it is written  (Hosea xiv. 4), 'I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely,  for mine anger is turned away from him.'\" It is not said, \"from them,\"  but \"from him.\"    Ibid., fol. 86, col. 2.    He who observes one precept, in addition to those which, as originally  laid upon him, he has discharged, shall receive favor from above, and is  equal to him who has fulfilled the whole law.    _Kiddushin_, fol. 39, col. 2.    If any man vow a vow by only one of all the utensils of the altar, he  has vowed by the corban, even although he did not mention the word in  his oath. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"He who swears by the word Jerusalem is as  though he had said nothing.\"    _Nedarim_, fol. 10, col. 2.    Balaam was lame in one foot and blind in one eye.    _Soteh_, fol. 10, col. 1, and _Sanhedrin_, fol. 105, col. 1.    One wins eternal life after a struggle of years; another finds it in one  hour (see Luke xxiii. 43).    _Avodah Zarah_, fol. 17, col. 1.    This saying is applied by Rabbi the Holy to Rabbi Eliezar, the son of  Durdia, a profligate who recommended himself to the favor of heaven by  one prolonged act of determined penitence, placing his head between his  knees and groaning and weeping till his soul departed from him, and his  sin and misery along with it; for at the moment of death a voice from  heaven came forth and said, \"Rabbi Eliezar, the son of Durdia, is  appointed to life everlasting.\" When Rabbi the Holy heard this, he wept,  and said, \"One wins eternal life after a struggle of years; another  finds it in one hour.\" (Compare Luke xv. 11-32.)    Whosoever destroyeth one soul of Israel, Scripture counts it to him as  though he had destroyed the whole world; and whoso preserveth one soul  of Israel, Scripture counts it as though he had preserved the whole  world.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 37, col. 1.    The greatness of God is infinite; for while with one die man impresses  many coins and all are exactly alike, the King of kings, the Holy  One--blessed be He!--with one die impresses the same image (of Adam) on  all men, and yet not one of them is like his neighbor. So that every one  ought to say, \"For myself is the world created.\"    Ibid., fol. 37, col. 1.    \"He caused the lame to mount on the back of the blind, and judged them  both as one.\" Antoninus said to the Rabbi, \"Body and soul might each  plead right of acquittal at the day of judgment.\" \"How so?\" he asked.  \"The body might plead that it was the soul that had sinned, and urge,  saying, 'See, since the departure of the soul I have lain in the grave  as still as a stone.' And the soul might plead, 'It was the body that  sinned, for since the day I left it, I have flitted about in the air as  innocent as a bird.'\" To which the Rabbi replied and said, \"Whereunto  this thing is like, I will tell thee in a parable. It is like unto a  king who had an orchard with some fine young fig trees planted in it. He  set two gardeners to take care of them, of whom one was lame and the  other blind. One day the lame one said to the blind 'I see some fine  figs in the garden; come, take me on thy shoulders, and we will pluck  them and eat them.' By and by the lord of the garden came, and missing  the fruit from the fig trees, began to make inquiry after them. The lame  one, to excuse himself, pleaded, 'I have no legs to walk with;' and the  blind one, to excuse himself, pleaded, 'I have no eyes to see with.'  What did the lord of the garden do? He caused the lame to mount upon the  back of the blind, and judged them both as one.\" So likewise will God  re-unite soul and body, and judge them both as one together; as it is  written (Ps. 1, 4), \"He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the  earth, that He may judge His people.\" \"He shall call to the heavens from  above,\" that alludes to the soul; \"and to the earth, that He may judge  His people,\" that refers to the body.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 91, cols, 1, 2.        Rabbi Yehudah, surnamed the Holy, the editor of the Mishnah, is      the personage here and elsewhere spoken of as the Rabbi by pre      eminence. He was an intimate friend of the Roman Emperor      Antoninus Pius.    One thing obtained with difficulty is far better than a hundred things  procured with ease.    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, ch. 3.    In the name of Rav, Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says, \"Whoso buys a scroll  of the law in the market seizes possession of another's meritorious act;  but if he himself copies out a scroll of the law, Scripture considers  him as if he had himself received it direct from Mount Sinai.\" \"Nay,\"  adds Rav Yehudah, in the name of Rav, \"even if he has amended one letter  in it, Scripture considers him as if he had written it out entirely.\"    _Menachoth_, fol. 30, col. 1.    He who forgets one thing that he has learned breaks a negative  commandment; for it is written (Deut. iv. 9), \"Take heed to thyself ...  lest thou forget the things.\"    _Menachoth_, fol. 99, col. 2.    A proselyte who has taken it upon himself to observe the law, but is  suspected of neglecting one point, is to be suspected of being guilty of  neglecting the whole law, and therefore regarded as an apostate  Israelite, and to be punished accordingly.    _Bechoroth_, fol. 30, col. 2.    It is written (Gen. xxviii. ii), \"And he took from the stones of the  place;\" and again it is written (ver. 18), \"And he took the stone.\"  Rabbi Isaac says this teaches that all these stones gathered themselves  together into one place, as if each were eager that the saint should lay  his head upon it. It happened, as the Rabbis tell us, that all the  stones were swallowed up by one another, and thus merged into one stone.    _Chullin_, fol. 91, col. 2.        Though the Midrash and two of the Targums, that of Jonathan and      the Yerushalmi, tell the same fanciful story about these stones,      Aben Ezra and R. Shemuel ben Meir among others adopt the      opposite and common-sense interpretation which assigns to the      word in Gen. xxviii. ii, no such occult meaning.    The psalms commencing \"Blessed is the man\" and \"Why do the heathen rage\"  constitute but one psalm.    _Berachoth_ fol. 9, col. 2.    The former Chasidim used to sit still one hour, and then pray for one  hour, and then again sit still for one hour.    Ibid., fol. 32, col. 2.    All the benedictions in the Temple used to conclude with the words  \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel unto eternity;\" but when the  Sadducees, corrupting the faith, maintained that there was only one  world, it was enacted that they should conclude with the words \"from  eternity unto eternity.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 54, col. i.        The Sadducees (Zadokim), so called after Zadok their master, as      is known, stood rigidly by the original Mosaic code, and set      themselves determinedly against all traditional developments. To      the Talmudists, therefore, they were especially obnoxious, and      their bald, cold creed is looked upon by them with something      like horror. It is thus the Talmud warns against them--\"Believe      not in thyself till the day of thy death, for, behold, Yochanan,      after officiating in the High Priesthood for eighty years,      became in the end a Sadducee.\" (_Berachoth_, fol. 29, col. 1.)

But so wills my destiny!    ZANETTO.       Ebben?          Well then?    SILVIA (after silence, and with great force).       Senti, bambrino. Non cercar di colei. La tua bell'anima non conosce il     pericolo! S'io non posso proteggerti, ospitarti, potrò salvarti.     Ascoltami. No, non andar da Silvia! Pagare il pane, il letto colla     canzon gioconda che ti fiorisce sulle labbra è bello ma bisogna     conoscere che pan che letto è quello. O Zanetto, se mi commovo è     perchè t'amo come un bambinello che si vuoi salvare. Oh seguita a     cantare del bosco fra le chiome. E se poi, quando la soglia d'un umil     casetta vedrai sovra il lavoro china, una giovinetta da gli occhi neri     e dai capelli d'oro, oh fermati cantore quello è il nido d'amore!          Hear me, my boy. Do not go to seek her. Thy lovely soul does not        know its danger! Now hear me. No! Don't go to Silvia. Pay for your        bread and your bed with the merry songs which come forth from your        beautiful lips,--but you should know what bread and what bed it is.        O Zanetto, if you see my emotion, it is because I love you, and        wish to save you. Keep on with your songs in the leafy forests; and        in the fragrance of another April, if near the threshold of an        humble cottage above a labored steep, you see a girl with black        eyes and golden hair--then rest.          From there do not move!        This is the nest of Love!    ZANETTO.       Ti obbedirò. Ma può darsi che Silvia sia calunniata.       (Silvia fa un gesto di dolore)            Certo     la ferita del povero tuo core ho riaperto! Tu     m'hai detto che hai l'anima triste!       Un fratello amato       Un caro fidanzato       La Silvia t'ha rubato!     Non temi sol per me, tu sei gelosa!        I will obey you. But if it should happen that you have slandered        Silvia--          (Silvia makes a gesture of grief).          Surely the wound of thy poor heart I have reopened. You have told        me that which makes my soul sad.          Of a loving brother          Of a trusting sweetheart,          Silvia, you have robbed.        You are not fearing only me, you are jealous!    SILVIA (with much sadness).       Immagini una cosa non vera. Va! Va! parti!       (dissimulando il dolore)       Tu non puoi figurarti, quanto mi dolga dirti che tu rivolga     Lontana il piè dall'intrapresa via!       Ma prima che tu vada       Per la tua strada     Me puoi rendere grazie io t'ho salvato!     Tutto è finito. Ohimè! Se m'avesse scoperto.          What you imagine is not true. Go! Go!          (feigning grief)          You can't believe        How much I grieve        To tell you to return--        Keep from that way        Your feet, I pray;        But ere you stray        Again away          To thank me, learn,          I have saved thee.        Ah me! All is over!        But should he me discover!    ZANETTO.       Partirò. Te n'accerto, non anderò da Silvia, dopo che m'hai detto.         Io partirò portando con meco       Un balsamo soave e sconosciuto       Qualche cosa di tenero       C'era nel tuo rifiuto!     E avrò di te soltanto la memoria     Che se non hai potuto ajutarmi.     O Madonna, in qualche canto del tuo     Core hai provato e dolore e rimpianto?          I go. I believe you, and will not go to Silvia, after what you have        said.          I go away, your hidden balsam using;        A little tenderness to me you are refusing!        I have of thee only the recollection that you          have not been willing to help me.          O Madonna! what corner            Of your heart          Holds your grieving            And weeping part?    SILVIA (eagerly offering him a ring).       No, certo, e quest'anello ti ricordi di me.          No, truly; this ring will remind you of me.    ZANETTO (with a gesture of refusal).         Perdona, troppo bello       Troppo ricco è il giojello       Grazie, Madonna       Accettar non posso!     Ma, dimmi, non sei tu vedova e povera?          Pardon! 'tis too rich for me!        With its jewels, you see;        Thanks, Madonna, I could not accept it.        But tell me, are you not a widow and very poor?    SILVIA (to herself).         Ma abbia riconosciuto       Ed una prova sia       Questo refiuto     Ma vuoi ch'io ti dia?          I have caught myself.          And a proof of my friendship you refuse?        What are you willing I should give you?    ZANETTO.       Un ricordo non voglio     L'elemosina un nulla     Ma che sia caro a te.     Guarda. Il fiore     Che fra tuoi splendidi     Capelli muore.          I want no reminder of value; but some little nothing that may be        dear to thee. Look! That flower in your beautiful hair will die--    SILVIA.           Eccoti il fior       Prima che sia spuntato il dì     Morrà nella tua mano       Il candido fiore, ma sua morte       Il voglio ti rammenti la mia sorte     Quando sarà appassito dimenticami.             Addio!            I give you the flower          The first I have picked today.          It will die in thy hand,        This white flower; then understand          It shows to you my destiny.          When the flower is withered,          I will have been forgotten.            Farewell!    ZANETTO.       O Madonna di grazia, una parola ancora     Io tremo nel riprender l'infinito     Mio viaggio, e mi pare che di qui non     Ci sieno più sentieri che portino     Alla gioja. Ho paura di scegliere.     La mia buona ventura ti guidi.     Scegli tu per me. Farò il cammino     Che m'imporrà la tua piccola     Mano.          Most charming Madonna, one word more. I tremble to take up again        my unending journey; and I believe that you can show me the path        to all happiness. I am afraid to pick it out. To my best fortune        guide me! I will take the way you point out with your beautiful        little hand.    SILVIA (who has ascended some of the steps of the terrace indicates the  direction leading away from the city.)       E sia! Dunque di là! dove splende l'aurora!          Be it so. 'Tis there!        Where glorious shines the Dawn!    ZANETTO.           Cuore!

Heart of mine, why from weeping        Comes the perfume, true love keeping?        Think you grieving all unbidden        In this flower can be hidden?

ALFIO, a teamster             Baritone.       LUCIA, mother of Turiddu      Contralto.       Chorus of peasants and villagers. Chorus behind the scenes.          PLOT OF THE OPERA       TURIDDU, a young villager, son of LUCIA, was LOLA's lover, when,     according to the military laws of Sicily, he was conscripted as a     soldier. He left LOLA, vowing eternal affection; but LOLA, growing     weary of waiting, in his absence, accepts the addresses of ALFIO, the     happy teamster of the village. At the end of his term of military     service, TURIDDU returns home, improved in appearance, style and     manners by his military training. Finding LOLA married, he wins the     affections of SANTUZZA, whom he at length betrays. Meantime the mutual     passion between him and LOLA revives, and is indulged in the absence     of ALFIO on his frequent trips to the neighboring villages in pursuit     of his calling. ALFIO's discovery on Easter morning of his wife's     unfaithfulness precipitates the catastrophe. Rejected and cast out by     her betrayer, SANTUZZA in a moment of extreme jealousy, exposes the     infamy of LOLA and TURIDDU. ALFIO challenges TURIDDU, according to the     rustic Sicilian code, in which each party bites the other's right ear.     It is understood between the combatants that the severity of the bite     in the challenge indicates the degree of animosity to be expected in     contest. TURIDDU regrets his evil course; but nevertheless resolves to     fight; and is killed.          CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA.
