You, Waldo, go and hide on the kopje;  Lyndall and I will shut eyes here, and we will not look.\"    The girls hid their faces in the stone wall of the sheep-kraal, and the  boy clambered half way up the kopje. He crouched down between two stones  and gave the call. Just then the milk-herd came walking out of the  cow-kraal with two pails. He was an ill-looking Kaffer.    \"Ah!\" thought the boy, \"perhaps he will die tonight, and go to hell! I  must pray for him, I must pray!\"    Then he thought--\"Where am I going to?\" and he prayed desperately.    \"Ah! this is not right at all,\" little Em said, peeping between the  stones, and finding him in a very curious posture. \"What are you doing  Waldo? It is not the play, you know. You should run out when we come to  the white stone. Ah, you do not play nicely.\"    \"I--I will play nicely now,\" said the boy, coming out and standing  sheepishly before them; \"I--I only forgot; I will play now.\"    \"He has been to sleep,\" said freckled Em.    \"No,\" said beautiful little Lyndall, looking curiously at him: \"he has  been crying.\"    She never made a mistake.    *****      The Confession.    One night, two years after, the boy sat alone on the kopje. He had crept  softly from his father's room and come there. He often did, because,  when he prayed or cried aloud, his father might awake and hear him; and  none knew his great sorrow, and none knew his grief, but he himself, and  he buried them deep in his heart.    He turned up the brim of his great hat and looked at the moon, but  most at the leaves of the prickly pear that grew just before him. They  glinted, and glinted, and glinted, just like his own heart--cold, so  hard, and very wicked. His physical heart had pain also; it seemed full  of little bits of glass, that hurt. He had sat there for half an hour,  and he dared not go back to the close house.    He felt horribly lonely. There was not one thing so wicked as he in  all the world, and he knew it. He folded his arms and began to cry--not  aloud; he sobbed without making any sound, and his tears left scorched  marks where they fell. He could not pray; he had prayed night and day  for so many months; and tonight he could not pray. When he left off  crying, he held his aching head with his brown hands. If one might have  gone up to him and touched him kindly; poor, ugly little thing! Perhaps  his heart was almost broken.    With his swollen eyes he sat there on a flat stone at the very top of  the kopje; and the tree, with every one of its wicked leaves, blinked,  and blinked, and blinked at him. Presently he began to cry again, and  then stopped his crying to look at it. He was quiet for a long while,  then he knelt up slowly and bent forward. There was a secret he had  carried in his heart for a year. He had not dared to look at it; he had  not whispered it to himself, but for a year he had carried it. \"I hate  God!\" he said. The wind took the words and ran away with them, among the  stones, and through the leaves of the prickly pear. He thought it died  away half down the kopje. He had told it now!    \"I love Jesus Christ, but I hate God.\"    The wind carried away that sound as it had done the first. Then he got  up and buttoned his old coat about him. He knew he was certainly lost  now; he did not care. If half the world were to be lost, why not he  too? He would not pray for mercy any more. Better so--better to know  certainly. It was ended now. Better so.    He began scrambling down the sides of the kopje to go home.    Better so! But oh, the loneliness, the agonized pain! for that night,  and for nights on nights to come! The anguish that sleeps all day on the  heart like a heavy worm, and wakes up at night to feed!    There are some of us who in after years say to Fate, \"Now deal us your  hardest blow, give us what you will; but let us never again suffer as we  suffered when we were children.\"    The barb in the arrow of childhood's suffering is this: its intense  loneliness, its intense agony.          Chapter 1.II. Plans and Bushman Paintings.    At last came the year of the great drought, the year of  eighteen-sixty-two. From end to end of the land the earth cried for  water. Man and beast turned their eyes to the pitiless sky, that like  the roof of some brazen oven arched overhead. On the farm, day after  day, month after month, the water in the dams fell lower and lower; the  sheep died in the fields; the cattle, scarcely able to crawl, tottered  as they moved from spot to spot in search of food. Week after week,  month after month, the sun looked down from the cloudless sky, till the  karoo-bushes were leafless sticks, broken into the earth, and the earth  itself was naked and bare; and only the milk-bushes, like old hags,  pointed their shrivelled fingers heavenward, praying for the rain that  never came.    *****    It was on an afternoon of a long day in that thirsty summer, that on the  side of the kopje furthest from the homestead the two girls sat. They  were somewhat grown since the days when they played hide-and-seek there,  but they were mere children still.    Their dress was of dark, coarse stuff; their common blue pinafores  reached to their ankles, and on their feet they wore home-made  velschoen.    They sat under a shelving rock, on the surface of which were still  visible some old Bushman paintings, their red and black pigments having  been preserved through long years from wind and rain by the overhanging  ledge; grotesque oxen, elephants, rhinoceroses, and a one-horned beast,  such as no man ever has seen or ever shall.    The girls sat with their backs to the paintings. In their laps were a  few fern and ice-plant leaves, which by dint of much searching they had  gathered under the rocks.    Em took off her big brown kapje and began vigorously to fan her red face  with it; but her companion bent low over the leaves in her lap, and at  last took up an ice-plant leaf and fastened it on to the front of her  blue pinafore with a pin.    \"Diamonds must look as these drops do,\" she said, carefully bending over  the leaf, and crushing one crystal drop with her delicate little nail.  \"When I,\" she said, \"am grown up, I shall wear real diamonds, exactly  like these in my hair.\"    Her companion opened her eyes and wrinkled her low forehead.    \"Where will you find them, Lyndall? The stones are only crystals that we  picked up yesterday. Old Otto says so.\"    \"And you think that I am going to stay here always?\"    The lip trembled scornfully.    \"Ah, no,\" said her companion. \"I suppose some day we shall go somewhere;  but now we are only twelve, and we cannot marry till we are seventeen.  Four years, five--that is a long time to wait. And we might not have  diamonds if we did marry.\"    \"And you think that I am going to stay here till then?\"    \"Well, where are you going?\" asked her companion.    The girl crushed an ice-plant leaf between her fingers.    \"Tant Sannie is a miserable old woman,\" she said. \"Your father married  her when he was dying, because he thought she would take better care of  the farm, and of us, than an English woman. He said we should be taught  and sent to school. Now she saves every farthing for herself, buys us  not even one old book. She does not ill-use us--why? Because she is  afraid of your father's ghost. Only this morning she told her Hottentot  that she would have beaten you for breaking the plate, but that three  nights ago she heard a rustling and a grunting behind the pantry door,  and knew it was your father coming to spook her. She is a miserable old  woman,\" said the girl, throwing the leaf from her; \"but I intend to go  to school.\"    \"And if she won't let you?\"    \"I shall make her.\"    \"How?\"    The child took not the slightest notice of the last question, and folded  her small arms across her knees.    \"But why do you want to go, Lyndall?\"    \"There is nothing helps in this world,\" said the child slowly, \"but to  be very wise, and to know everything--to be clever.\"    \"But I should not like to go to school!\" persisted the small freckled  face.    \"And you do not need to. When you are seventeen this Boer-woman will go;  you will have this farm and everything that is upon it for your own; but  I,\" said Lyndall, \"will have nothing. I must learn.\"    \"Oh, Lyndall! I will give you some of my sheep,\" said Em, with a sudden  burst of pitying generosity.    \"I do not want your sheep,\" said the girl slowly; \"I want things of my  own. When I am grown up,\" she added, the flush on her delicate features  deepening at every word, \"there will be nothing that I do not know. I  shall be rich, very rich; and I shall wear not only for best, but every  day, a pure white silk, and little rose-buds, like the lady in Tant  Sannie's bedroom, and my petticoats will be embroidered, not only at the  bottom, but all through.\"    The lady in Tant Sannie's bedroom was a gorgeous creature from a  fashion-sheet, which the Boer-woman, somewhere obtaining, had pasted up  at the foot of her bed, to be profoundly admired by the children.    \"It would be very nice,\" said Em; but it seemed a dream of quite too  transcendent a glory ever to be realized.    At this instant there appeared at the foot of the kopje two figures--the  one, a dog, white and sleek, one yellow ear hanging down over his left  eye; the other, his master, a lad of fourteen, and no other than the boy  Waldo, grown into a heavy, slouching youth of fourteen. The dog mounted  the kopje quickly, his master followed slowly. He wore an aged jacket  much too large for him, and rolled up at the wrists, and, as of old, a  pair of dilapidated velschoens and a felt hat. He stood before the two  girls at last.    \"What have you been doing today?\" asked Lyndall, lifting her eyes to his  face.    \"Looking after ewes and lambs below the dam. Here!\" he said, holding out  his hand awkwardly, \"I brought them for you.\"    There were a few green blades of"]]]
