Lord March, thin, agile,  and admirably qualified for exertion, was the victor. Still more  celebrated was his Lordship's wager with the famous Count O'Taafe.  During a conversation at a convivial meeting on the subject of  'running against time,' it was suggested by Lord March, that it  was possible for a carriage to be drawn with a degree of celerity  previously unexampled, and believed to be impossible. Being desired to  name his maximum, he undertook, provided choice of ground were given  him and a certain period for training, to draw a carriage with four  wheels not less than nineteen miles within the space of sixty minutes.  The accomplishment of such rapidity staggered the belief of his  hearers; and a heavy wager was the consequence. Success mainly  depending on the lightness of the carriage, Wright of Long Acre, the  most ingenious coach-builder of the day, devoted the whole resources  of his skill to its construction, and produced a vehicle formed partly  of wood and partly of whale-bone, with silk harness, that came up  to the wishes of his employer. Four blood horses of approved speed  were then selected, and the course at Newmarket chosen as the ground  of contest. On the day appointed, 29th of August, 1750, noble and  ignoble gamesters journeyed from far and near to witness the wonderful  experiment; excitement reached the highest point, and bets to an  enormous amount were made. At length the jockeys mounted; the carriage  was put in motion, and rushing on with a velocity marvelous in those  times of coach traveling, but easily conceived by us railway travelers  of the nineteenth century, gained within the stipulated hour the goal  of victory.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE DECAY OF GREAT FAMILIES.    Not the least valuable parts of Burke's just published \"Anecdotes of  the Aristocracy,\" are a species of essay on the fortunes of families.  The following is from a chapter on their decadence:    \"It has often occurred to us that a very interesting paper might  be written on the rise and fall of English families. Truly does Dr.  Borlase remark that 'the most lasting houses have only their seasons,  more or less, of a certain constitutional strength. They have their  spring and summer sunshine glare, their wane, decline, and death.'  Take, for example, the Plantagenets, the Staffords, and the Nevills,  the three most illustrious names on the roll of England's nobility.  What race in Europe surpassed in royal position, in personal  achievement, our Henries and our Edwards? and yet we find the  great-great-grandson of Margaret Plantagenet, daughter and heiress  of George Duke of Clarence, following the craft of a cobbler at the  little town of Newport in Shropshire, in the year 1637. Beside, if  we were to investigate the fortunes of many of the inheritors of the  royal arms, it would soon be discovered that        'The aspiring blood of Lancaster'    had sunk into the ground. The princely stream at the present time  flows through very humble veins. Among the lineal descendants of  Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent, sixth son of Edward I., King  of England, entitled to quarter the Royal arms, occur Mr. Joseph  Smart, of Hales Owen, butcher, and Mr. George Wilmot, keeper of the  turnpike-gate at Cooper's Bank, near Dudley; and among the descendants  of Thomas Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, fifth son of Edward  III., we may mention Mr. Stephen James Penny, the late sexton at St.  George's, Hanover Square.    \"The story of the Gargraves is a melancholy chapter in the romance  of real life. For full two centuries, or more, scarcely a family in  Yorkshire enjoyed a higher position. Its chiefs earned distinction  in peace and war; one died in France, Master of the Ordnance to King  Henry V.; another, a soldier, too, fell with Salisbury, at the siege  of Orleans; and a third filled the Speaker's chair of the House of  Commons. What an awful contrast to this fair picture does the sequel  offer. Thomas Gargrave, the Speaker's eldest son, was hung at York,  for murder; and his half-brother, Sir Richard, endured a fate only  less miserable. The splendid estate he inherited he wasted by the most  wanton extravagance, and at length reduced himself to abject want.  'His excesses,' says Mr. Hunter, in his 'History of Doncaster,' 'are  still, at the expiration of two centuries, the subject of village  tradition; and his attachment to gaming is commemorated in an old  painting, long preserved in the neighboring mansion of Badsworth, in  which he is represented as playing at the old game of put, the right  hand against the left, for the stake of a cup of ale.    \"The close of Sir Richard's story is as lamentable as its course.  An utter bankrupt in means and reputation, he is stated to have been  reduced to travel with the pack-horses to London, and was at last  found dead in an old hostelry! He had married Catherine, sister of  Lord Danvers, and by her left three daughters. Of the descendants of  his brothers few particulars can be ascertained. Not many years since,  a Mr. Gargrave, believed to be one of them, filled the mean employment  of parish-clerk of Kippax.    \"A similar melancholy narrative applies to another great Yorkshire  house. Sir William Reresby, Bart., son and heir of the celebrated  author, succeeded, at the death of his father, in 1689, to the  beautiful estate of Thrybergh, in Yorkshire, where his ancestors had  been seated uninterruptedly from the time of the Conquest; and he  lived to see himself denuded of every acre of his broad lands. Le Neve  states, in his MSS. preserved in the Heralds' College, that he became  a tapster in the King's Bench Prison, and was tried and imprisoned for  cheating in 1711. He was alive in 1727, when Wootton's account of the  Baronets was published. In that work he is said to be reduced to a low  condition. At length he died in great obscurity, a melancholy instance  how low pursuits and base pleasures may sully the noblest name, and  waste an estate gathered with labor and preserved by the care of a  race of distinguished progenitors. Gaming was amongst Sir William's  follies--particularly that lowest specimen of the folly, the fights  of game-cocks. The tradition at Thrybergh is (for his name is not  quite forgotten) that the fine estate of Dennaby was staked and lost  on a single main. Sir William Reresby was not the only baronet who  disgraced his order at that period. In 1722, Sir Charles Burton was  tried at the Old Bailey for stealing a seal; pleaded poverty, but  was found guilty, and sentenced to transportation; which sentence was  afterward commuted for a milder punishment.\"           *       *       *       *       *      MADRID AND THE SPANISH SENATE.    Gazpacho; or, Summer Months in Spain, is the title of a new book by W.  George Clark, published in London. Gazpacho, it seems, is the name of  a dish peculiar to Spain, but of universal use there, a sort of cold  soup, made up of familiars and handy things, as bread, pot-herbs, oil,  and water. \"My Gazpacho,\" says the author, \"has been prepared after  a similar receipt. I know not how it will please the more refined  and fastidious palates to which it will be submitted; indeed, amid  the multitude of dainties wherewith the table is loaded, it may well  remain untasted.\" It at least deserves a better fate than that. The  volume relates, in a pleasant, intelligent, and gossiping way, a  summer's ramble through Spain, describing with considerable force the  peculiarities of its people, and the romantic features by which it  is marked. The clever painter could not have better materials. The  party-colored costumes of the peasants, like dahlias at a Chiswick  show; the somber garments of the priests, the fine old churches, the  queer rambling houses, looking centuries old, the dull, gloomy streets  of Madrid, the life and activity of the market-place. Such are the  objects upon which the eye rests, and of which Mr. Clark was too  observant to neglect any. The following passages will give an idea of  the materials of which the Gazpacho is made up:--    MADRID.    \"I left, I suppose, scarcely a street in Madrid which I did not  traverse, or a church which I did not enter. The result is hardly  worth the trouble. One street and church are exactly like another  street and church. In the latter, one always finds the same profusion  of wooden Christs, and Madonnas in real petticoats, on the walls, and  the same scanty sprinkling of worshipers, also in petticoats, on the  floor. The images outnumber the devotees here, as in all other Roman  Catholic countries (except Ireland, which is an exception to every  rule.) To a stranger, the markets are always the most interesting  haunts. A Spaniard, he or she, talks more while making the daily  bargain than in all the rest of the twenty-four hours. The fruit and  vegetable market was my especial lounge. There is such a fresh, sweet  smell of the country, and the groups throw themselves, or are thrown,  into such pretty tableaux after the Rubens and Snyders fashion. The  shambles one avoids instinctively, and fish-market there is none,  for Madrid is fifty hours' journey from the nearest sea, and the  Manzanares has every requisite for a fine trout stream, but water.    \"Madrid has one peculiarity which conduces very much to the visitor's  comfort, namely, that there are very few inevitable 'sights' to be  gone through. The armory said to be the finest in the world; the  palace, ditto (which people who are addicted to upholstering may  go and see, if they don't mind breaking the tenth commandment); the  museum of natural history, where is the largest loadstone in active  operation between this and Medina; and the Academia, nearly complete  the list. Everybody should devote a morning to the last-named, were it  only for the sake of the Murillos.

Then for some while we waited while I struggled with the  situation; conversation flowed slowly. And again the draught came  trailing up the room, while the flaring candles filled it with  hurrying shadows. \"Ah, late again, Cicely,\" said my host in his soft,  mournful way. \"Always late, Cicely.\" Then I went down to dinner with  that man and his mind and the twelve phantoms that haunted it. I found  a long table with fine old silver on it and places laid for fourteen.  The butler was now in evening dress, there were fewer draughts in the  dining-room, the scene was less gloomy there. \"Will you sit next to  Rosalind at the other end,\" Richard said to me. \"She always takes the  head of the table, I wronged her most of all.\" I said, \"I shall be  delighted.\"    I looked at the butler closely, but never did I see by any expression  of his face or by anything that he did any suggestion that he waited  upon less than fourteen people in the complete possession of all their  faculties. Perhaps a dish appeared to be refused more often than taken  but every glass was equally filled with champagne. At first I found  little to say, but when Sir Richard speaking from the far end of the  table said, \"You are tired, Mr. Linton,\" I was reminded that I owed  something to a host upon whom I had forced myself. It was excellent  champagne and with the help of a second glass I made the effort to  begin a conversation with a Miss Helen Errold for whom the place upon  one side of me was laid. It came more easy to me very soon, I  frequently paused in my monologue, like Mark Anthony, for a reply, and  sometimes I turned and spoke to Miss Rosalind Smith. Sir Richard at  the other end talked sorrowfully on, he spoke as a condemned man might  speak to his judge, and yet somewhat as a judge might speak to one  that he once condemned wrongly. My own mind began to turn to mournful  things. I drank another glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty. I  felt as if all the moisture in my body had been blown away over the  downs of Kent by the wind up which we had galloped. Still I was not  talking enough; my host was looking at me. I made another effort,  after all I had something to talk about, a twenty-mile point is not  often seen in a lifetime, especially south of the Thames. I began to  describe the run to Rosalind Smith. I could see then that my host was  pleased, the sad look in his face gave a kind of a flicker, like mist  upon the mountains on a miserable day when a faint puff comes from the  sea and the mist would lift if it could. And the butler refilled my  glass very attentively. I asked her first if she hunted, and paused  and began my story. I told her where we had found the fox and how fast  and straight he had gone, and how I had got through the village by  keeping to the road, while the little gardens and wire, and then the  river, had stopped the rest of the field. I told her the kind of  country that we crossed and how splendid it looked in the Spring, and  how mysterious the valleys were as soon as the twilight came, and what  a glorious horse I had and how wonderfully he went. I was so fearfully  thirsty after the great hunt that I had to stop for a moment now and  then, but I went on with my description of that famous run, for I had  warmed to the subject, and after all there was nobody to tell of it  but me except my old whipper-in, and \"the old fellow's probably drunk  by now,\" I thought. I described to her minutely the exact spot in the  run at which it had come to me clearly that this was going to be the  greatest hunt in the whole history of Kent. Sometimes I forgot  incidents that had happened as one well may in a run of twenty miles,  and then I had to fill in the gaps by inventing. I was pleased to be  able to make the party go off well by means of my conversation, and  besides that the lady to whom I was speaking was extremely pretty: I  do not mean in a flesh and blood kind of way but there were little  shadowy lines about the chair beside me that hinted at an unusually  graceful figure when Miss Rosalind Smith was alive; and I began to  perceive that what I first mistook for the smoke of guttering candles  and a table-cloth waving in the draught was in reality an extremely  animated company who listened, and not without interest, to my story  of by far the greatest hunt that the world had ever known: indeed I  told them that I would confidently go further and predict that never  in the history of the world would there be such a run again. Only my  throat was terribly dry. And then as it seemed they wanted to hear  more about my horse. I had forgotten that I had come there on a horse,  but when they reminded me it all came back; they looked so charming  leaning over the table intent upon what I said, that I told them  everything they wanted to know. Everything was going so pleasantly if  only Sir Richard would cheer up. I heard his mournful voice every now  and then--these were very pleasant people if only he would take them  the right way. I could understand that he regretted his past, but the  early seventies seemed centuries away and I felt sure that he  misunderstood these ladies, they were not revengeful as he seemed to  suppose. I wanted to show him how cheerful they really were, and so I  made a joke and they an laughed at it, and then I chaffed them a bit,  especially Rosalind, and nobody resented it in the very least. And  still Sir Richard sat there with that unhappy look, like one that has  ended weeping because it is vain and has not the consolation even of  tears.    We had been a long time there and many of the candles had burned out,  but there was light enough. I was glad to have an audience for my  exploit, and being happy myself I was determined Sir Richard should  be. I made more jokes and they still laughed good-naturedly; some of  the jokes were a little broad perhaps but no harm was meant. And  then--I do not wish to excuse myself--but I had had a harder day than  I ever had had before and without knowing it I must have been  completely exhausted; in this state the champagne had found me, and  what would have been harmless at any other time must somehow have got  the better of me when quite tired out--anyhow I went too far, I made  some joke--I cannot in the least remember what--that suddenly seemed  to offend them. I felt all at once a commotion in the air, I looked up  and saw that they had all arisen from the table and were sweeping  towards the door: I had not time to open it but it blew open on a  wind, I could scarcely see what Sir Richard was doing because only two  candles were left, I think the rest blew out when the ladies suddenly  rose. I sprang up to apologise, to assure them--and then fatigue  overcame me as it had overcome my horse at the last fence, I clutched  at the table but the cloth came away and then I fell. The fall, and  the darkness on the floor and the pent up fatigue of the day overcame  me all three together.    The sun shone over glittering fields and in at a bedroom window and  thousands of birds were chanting to the Spring, and there I was in an  old four-poster bed in a quaint old panelled bedroom, fully dressed  and wearing long muddy boots; someone had taken my spurs and that was  all. For a moment I failed to realise and then it all came back, my  enormity and the pressing need of an abject apology to Sir Richard. I  pulled an embroidered bell rope until the butler came. He came in  perfectly cheerful and indescribably shabby. I asked him if Sir  Richard was up, and he said he had just gone down, and told me to my  amazement that it was twelve o'clock. I asked to be shown in to Sir  Richard at once. He was in his smoking-room. \"Good morning,\" he said  cheerfully the moment I went in. I went directly to the matter in  hand. \"I fear that I insulted some ladies in your house--\" I began.    \"You did indeed,\" he said, \"You did indeed.\" And then he burst into  tears and took me by the hand. \"How can I ever thank you?\" he said to  me then. \"We have been thirteen at table for thirty years and I never  dared to insult them because I had wronged them all, and now you have  done it and I know they will never dine here again.\" And for a long  time he still held my hand, and then he gave it a grip and a kind of a  shake which I took to mean \"Goodbye\" and I drew my hand away then and  left the house. And I found James in the stables with the hounds and  asked him how he had fared, and James, who is a man of very few words,  said he could not rightly remember, and I got my spurs from the butler  and climbed on to my horse and slowly we rode away from that queer old  house, and slowly we wended home, for the hounds were footsore but  happy and the horses were tired still. And when we recalled that the  hunting season was ended we turned our faces to Spring and thought of  the new things that try to replace the old. And that very year I  heard, and have often heard since, of dances and happier dinners at  Sir Richard Arlen's house.            The City on Mallington Moor    Besides the old shepherd at Lingwold whose habits render him  unreliable I am probably the only person that has ever seen the city  on Mallington Moor.    I had decided one year to do no London season; partly because of the  ugliness of the things in the shops, partly because of the unresisted  invasions of German bands, partly perhaps because some pet parrots in  the oblong where I lived had learned to imitate cab-whistles; but  chiefly because of late there had seized me in London a quite  unreasonable longing for large woods and waste spaces, while the very  thought of little valleys underneath copses full of bracken and  foxgloves was a torment to me and every summer in London the longing  grew worse till the thing was becoming intolerable. So I took a stick  and a knapsack and began walking northwards, starting at Tetherington  and sleeping at inns,"]]]
