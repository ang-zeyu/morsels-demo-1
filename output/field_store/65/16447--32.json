[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#3)"],[1," a  kind of confidence in me now. Besides, even from the poop I could see  no flames. But the night was as beautiful as it had been an hour or two  back; the stars as brilliant, the breeze even more balmy, the sea even  more calm; and we were hove-to already, against the worst.    In this hour of peril the poop was very properly invaded by all classes  of passengers, in all manner of incongruous apparel, in all stages of  fear, rage, grief and hysteria; as we made our way among this motley  nightmare throng, I took Ready by the arm.    \"The skipper's a brute,\" said I, \"but he's the right brute in the right  place to-night, Ready!\"    \"I hope he may be,\" was the reply. \"But we were off our course this  afternoon; and we were off it again during the concert, as sure as we're  not on it now.\"    His tone made me draw him to the rail.    \"But how do you know? You didn't have another look, did you?\"    \"Lots of looks-at the stars. He couldn't keep me from consulting them;  and I'm just as certain of it as I'm certain that we've a cargo aboard  which we're none of us supposed to know anything about.\"    The latter piece of gossip was, indeed, all over the ship; but this  allusion to it struck me as foolishly irrelevant and frivolous. As to  the other matter, I suggested that the officers would have had more to  say about it than Ready, if there had been anything in it.    \"Officers be damned!\" cried our consumptive, with a sound man's vigor.  \"They're ordinary seamen dressed up; I don't believe they've a second  mate's certificate between them, and they're frightened out of their  souls.\"    \"Well, anyhow, the skipper isn't that.\"    \"No; he's drunk; he can shout straight, but you should hear him try to  speak.\"    I made my way aft without rejoinder. \"Invalid's pessimism,\" was my  private comment. And yet the sick man was whole for the time being; the  virile spirit was once more master of the recreant members; and it  was with illogical relief that I found those I sought standing almost  unconcernedly beside the binnacle.    My little friend was, indeed, pale enough, and her eyes great with  dismay; but she stood splendidly calm, in her travelling cloak and  bonnet, and with all my soul I hailed the hardihood with which I had  rightly credited my love. Yes! I loved her then. It had come home to me  at last, and I no longer denied it in my heart. In my innocence and my  joy I rather blessed the fire for showing me her true self and my own;  and there I stood, loving her openly with my eyes (not to lose another  instant), and bursting to tell her so with my lips.    But there also stood Senhor Santos, almost precisely as I had seen him  last, cigarette, tie-pin, and all. He wore an overcoat, however, and  leaned upon a massive ebony cane, while he carried his daughter's guitar  in its case, exactly as though they were waiting for a train. Moreover,  I thought that for the first time he was regarding me with no very  favoring glance.    \"You don't think it serious?\" I asked him abruptly, my heart still  bounding with the most incongruous joy.    He gave me his ambiguous shrug; and then, \"A fire at sea is surely  sirrious,\" said he.    \"Where did it break out?\"    \"No one knows; it may have come of your concert.\"    \"But they are getting the better of it?\"    \"They are working wonders so far, senhor.\"    \"You see, Miss Denison,\" I continued ecstatically, \"our rough old  diamond of a skipper is the right man in the right place after all. A  tight man in a tight place, eh?\" and I laughed like an idiot in their  calm grave faces.    \"Senhor Cole is right,\" said Santos, \"although his 'ilarity sims a  leetle out of place. But you must never spik against Captain 'Arrees  again, menma.\"    \"I never will,\" the poor child said; yet I saw her wince whenever the  captain raised that hoarse voice of his in more and more blasphemous  exhortation; and I began to fear with Ready that the man was drunk.    My eyes were still upon my darling, devouring her, revelling in her,  when suddenly I saw her hand twitch within her step-father's arm. It was  an answering start to one on his part. The cigarette was snatched from  his lips. There was a commotion forward, and a cry came aft, from mouth  to mouth:    \"The flames! The flames!\"    I turned, and caught their reflection on the white column of smoke and  steam. I ran forward, and saw them curling and leaping in the hell-mouth  of the hold.    The quarter-deck now staged a lurid scene: that blazing trap-door in  its midst; and each man there a naked demon madly working to save his  roasting skin. Abaft the mainmast the deck-pump was being ceaselessly  worked by relays of the passengers; dry blankets were passed forward,  soaking blankets were passed aft, and flung flat into the furnace one  after another. These did more good than the pure water: the pillar of  smoke became blacker, denser: we were at a crisis; a sudden hush denoted  it; even our hoarse skipper stood dumb.    I had rushed down into the waist of the ship--blushing for my delay--and  already I was tossing blankets with the rest. Looking up in an enforced  pause, I saw Santos whispering in the skipper's ear, with the expression  of a sphinx but no lack of foreign gesticulation--behind them a fringe  of terror-stricken faces, parted at that instant by two more figures,  as wild and strange as any in that wild, strange scene. One was our  luckless lucky digger, the other a gigantic Zambesi nigger, who for  days had been told off to watch him; this was the servant (or rather the  slave) of Senhor Santos.    The digger planted himself before the captain. His face was reddened by  a fire as consuming as that within the bowels of our gallant ship. He  had a huge, unwieldy bundle under either arm.    \"Plain question--plain answer,\" we heard him stutter. \"Is there any ----  chance of saving this ---- ship?\"    His adjectives were too foul for print; they were given with such a  special effort at distinctness, however, that I was smiling one instant,  and giving thanks the next that Eva Denison had not come forward with  her guardian. Meanwhile the skipper had exchanged a glance with Senhor  Santos, and I think we all felt that he was going to tell us the truth.    He told it in two words--\"Very little.\"    Then the first individual tragedy was enacted before every eye. With  a yell the drunken maniac rushed to the rail. The nigger was at his  heels--he was too late. Uttering another and more piercing shriek, the  madman was overboard at a bound; one of his bundles preceded him; the  other dropped like a cannon-ball on the deck.    The nigger caught it up and carried it forward to the captain.    Harris held up his hand. We were still before we had fairly found our  tongues. His words did run together a little, but he was not drunk.    \"Men and women,\" said he, \"what I told that poor devil is Gospel truth;  but I didn't tell him we'd no chance of saving our lives, did I? Not  me, because we have! Keep your heads and listen to me. There's two  good boats on the davits amidships; the chief will take one, the second  officer the other; and there ain't no reason why every blessed one of  you shouldn't sleep in Ascension to-morrow night. As for me, let me see  every soul off of my ship and perhaps I may follow; but by the God that  made you, look alive! Mr. Arnott--Mr. McClellan--man them boats and  lower away. You can't get quit o' the ship too soon, an' I don't mind  tellin' you why. I'll tell you the worst, an' then you'll know. There's  been a lot o' gossip goin', gossip about my cargo. I give out as I'd  none but ship's stores and ballast, an' I give out a lie. I don't mind  tellin' you now. I give out a cussed lie, but I give it out for the  good o' the ship! What was the use o' frightenin' folks? But where's the  sense in keepin' it back now? We have a bit of a cargo,\" shouted Harris;  \"and it's gunpowder--every damned ton of it!\"    The effect of this announcement may be imagined; my hand has not the  cunning to reproduce it on paper; and if it had, it would shrink from  the task. Mild men became brutes, brutal men, devils, women--God help  them!--shrieking beldams for the most part. Never shall I forget them  with their streaming hair, their screaming open mouths, and the cruel  ascending fire glinting on their starting eyeballs!    Pell-mell they tumbled down the poop-ladders; pell-mell they raced  amidships past that yawning open furnace; the pitch was boiling through  the seams of the crackling deck; they slipped and fell upon it, one over  another, and the wonder is that none plunged headlong into the flames.  A handful remained on the poop, cowering and undone with terror. Upon  these turned Captain Harris, as Ready and I, stemming the torrent of  maddened humanity, regained the poop ourselves.    \"For'ard with ye!\" yelled the skipper. \"The powder's underneath you in  the lazarette!\"    They were gone like hunted sheep. And now abaft the flaming hatchway  there were only we four surviving saloon passengers, the captain, his  steward, the Zambesi negro, and the quarter-master at the wheel. The  steward and the black I observed putting stores aboard the captain's gig  as it overhung the water from the stern davits.    \"Now, gentlemen,\" said Harris to the two of us, \"I must trouble you to  step forward with the rest. Senhor Santos insists on taking his chance  along with the young lady in my gig. I've told him the risk, but he  insists, and the gig'll hold no more.\"    \"But she must have a crew, and I can row. For God's sake take me,  captain!\" cried I; for Eva Denison sat weeping in her deck chair, and my  heart bled faint at the thought of leaving her, I who loved her so, and  might die without ever telling her my love! Harris, however, stood firm.    \"There's that quartermaster and my steward, and Jose the nigger,\" said  he. \"That's quite enough, Mr. Cole, for I ain't above an oar myself;  but, by God, I'm skipper o' this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1," a thread of untwisted silk. And immediately every  door in the enchanted garden flew open, and the magician Ormadine  appeared, his hair standing on end; and he, after kissing the hand of  the champion, led him to a cave where a young man wrapped in a sheet of  gold lay sleeping, lulled by the songs of four beautiful maidens.    \"The Knight whom thou seest here!\" said the necromancer in a hollow  voice, \"is none other than thy brother-in-arms, the Christian Champion  St. David of Wales. He also attempted to draw my sword but failed. Him  hast thou delivered from my enchantments since they come to an end.\"    Now, as he spoke, came such a rattling of the skies, such a lumbering of  the earth as never was, and in the twinkling of an eye the Enchanted  Garden and all in it vanished from view, leaving the Champion of Wales,  roused from his seven years' sleep, giving thanks to St. George, who  greeted his ancient comrade heartily.    After this St. George of Merrie England travelled far and travelled  fast, with many adventures by the way, to Egypt where he had left his  beloved Princess Sabia. But, learning to his great grief and horror from  the same hermit he had met on first landing, that, despite her denials,  her father, King Ptolemy, had consented to Almidor the black King of  Morocco carrying her off as one of his many wives, he turned his steps  towards Tripoli, the capital of Morocco; for he was determined at all  costs to gain a sight of the dear Princess from whom he had been so  cruelly rent.    To this end he borrowed an old cloak of the hermit, and, disguised as a  beggar, gained admittance to the gate of the Women's Palace, where were  gathered together on their knees many others, poor, frail, infirm.    And when he asked them wherefore they knelt, they answered:    \"Because good Queen Sabia succours us that we may pray for the safety of  St. George of England, to whom she gave her heart.\"    Now when St. George heard this his own heart was like to break for very  joy, and he could scarce keep on his knees when, lovely as ever, but  with her face pale and sad and wan from long distress, the Princess  Sabia appeared clothed in deep mourning.    In silence she handed an alms to each beggar in turn; but when she came  to St. George she started and laid her hand on her heart. Then she said  softly:    \"Rise up, Sir Beggar! Thou art too like one who rescued me from death,  for it to be meet for thee to kneel before me!\"    Then St. George rising, and bowing low, said quietly: \"Peerless lady!  Lo! I am that very knight to whom thou did'st condescend to give this.\"    And with this he slipped the diamond ring she had given him on her  finger. But she looked not at it, but at him, with love in her eyes.    Then he told her of her father's base treachery and Almidor's part in  it, so that her anger grew hot and she cried:    \"Waste no more time in talk. I remain no longer in this detested place.  Ere Almidor returns from hunting we shall have escaped.\"    [Illustration: When she came to St. George she started and laid her  hand on her heart]    So she led St. George to the armoury, where he found his trusty sword  Ascalon, and to the stable, where his swift steed Bayard stood ready  caparisoned.    Then, when her brave Knight had mounted, and she, putting her foot on  his, had leapt like a bird behind him, St. George touched the proud  beast lightly with his spurs, and, like an arrow from a bow, Bayard  carried them together over city and plain, through woods and forests,  across rivers, and mountains, and valleys, until they reached the Land  of Greece.    And here they found the whole country in festivity over the marriage of  the King. Now amongst other entertainments was a grand tournament, the  news of which had spread through the world. And to it had come all the  other Six Champions of Christendom; so St. George arriving made the  Seventh. And many of the champions had with them the fair lady they had  rescued. St. Denys of France brought beautiful Eglantine, St. James of  Spain sweet Celestine, while noble Rosalind accompanied St. Anthony of  Italy. St. David of Wales, after his seven years' sleep, came full of  eager desire for adventure. St. Patrick of Ireland, ever courteous,  brought all the six Swan-princesses who, in gratitude, had been seeking  their deliverer St. Andrew of Scotland; since he, leaving all worldly  things, had chosen to fight for the faith.    So all these brave knights and fair ladies joined in the joyful  jousting, and each of the Seven Champions was in turn Chief Challenger  for a day.    Now in the midst of all the merriment appeared a hundred heralds from a  hundred different parts of the Paynim world, declaring war to the death  against all Christians.    Whereupon the Seven Champions agreed that each should return to his  native land to place his dearest lady in safety, and gather together an  army, and that six months later they should meet, and, joining as one  legion, go forth to fight for Christendom.    And this was done. So, having chosen St. George as Chief General, they  marched on Tripoli with the cry:      \"For Christendom we fight,     For Christendom we die.\"    Here the wicked Almidor fell in single combat with St. George, to the  great delight of his subjects, who begged the Champion to be King in his  stead. To this he consented, and, after he was crowned, the Christian  host went on towards Egypt where King Ptolemy, in despair of vanquishing  such stalwart knights, threw himself down from the battlements of the  palace and was killed. Whereupon, in recognition of the chivalry and  courtesy of the Christian Champions, the nobles offered the Crown to one  of their number, and they with acclaim chose St. George of Merrie  England.    Thence the Christian host journeyed to Persia, where a fearsome battle  raged for seven days, during which two hundred thousand pagans were  slain, beside many who were drowned in attempting to escape. Thus they  were compelled to yield, the Emperor himself happening into the hands of  St. George, and six other viceroys into the hands of the six other  Champions.    And these were most mercifully and honourably entreated after they had  promised to govern Persia after Christian rules. Now the Emperor, having  a heart fraught with despite and tyranny, conspired against them, and  engaged a wicked wizard named Osmond to so beguile six of the Champions  that they gave up fighting, and lived an easy slothful life. But St.  George would not be beguiled; neither would he consent to the  enchantment of his brothers; and he so roused them that they never  sheathed their swords nor unlocked their armour till the wicked Emperor  and his viceroys were thrown into that very dungeon in which St. George  had languished for seven long years.    Whereupon St. George took upon himself the government of Persia, and  gave the six other Champions the six viceroyalties.    So, attired in a beautiful green robe, richly embroidered, over which  was flung a scarlet mantle bordered with white fur and decorated with  ornaments of pure gold, he took his seat on the throne which was  supported by elephants of translucent alabaster. And the Heralds at  arms, amid the shouting of the people, cried:    \"Long live St. George of Merrie England, Emperor of Morocco, King of  Egypt, and Sultan of Persia!\"    Now, after that he had established good and just laws to such effect  that innumerable companies of pagans flocked to become Christians, St.  George, leaving the Government in the hands of his trusted counsellors,  took truce with the world and returned to England, where, at Coventry,  he lived for many years with the Egyptian Princess Sabia, who bore him  three stalwart sons. So here endeth the tale of St. George of Merrie  England, first and greatest of the Seven Champions.          THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS      Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house  of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was  a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a  bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a  middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the  Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for  the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear;  and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to  sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed  for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.    One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and  poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while  the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by  beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And  while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the  other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother,  passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in  at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl.  Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not  fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm,  and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened  the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge  on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would  have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have  asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so,  as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and  hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set  about helping herself.    First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too  hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the"]]]
