In doing this, I have no doubt I have been quite as correct as I  should have been had I waded through the various authors who have  written on the subject, as I have invariably accepted the name adopted  by Professor Newton in his edition of Yarrell, and by Mr. Dresser in his  'Birds of Europe', as far as these works are yet complete: for the birds  not yet included in either I have for the most part taken the scientific  names from Mr. Howard Saunders's 'Catalogue des oiseaux du midi de  L'Espagne,' published in the 'Proceedings' of the Societe Zoologique de  France; and for the names of the Gulls and Terns I have entirely  followed Mr. Howard Saunders's papers on those birds published in the  'Proceedings' of our own Zoological Society, for permission to use  which, and for other assistance,--especially in egg-hunting,--I have to  give him my best thanks.    As French is so much spoken in Guernsey and the other Islands included  in my district, I have (wherever I have been able to ascertain it) given  the French name of each bird, as it may be better known to my Guernsey  readers than either the English or the scientific name. I have also,  where there is one and I have been able to ascertain it, mentioned the  local name in the course of my notes on each bird.    It now only remains to give my best thanks to the various friends who  have assisted me, especially to Mr. MacCulloch, who, though he says he  is no naturalist, has supplied me with various very interesting notes,  which he has taken from time to time of ornithological events which have  occurred in Guernsey, and from which I have drawn rather largely; and I  have, also, again to thank him for the interesting accounts he has given  me of the various changes--agricultural and otherwise--which have taken  place during his memory, and which may have had some effect on the  ornithology of the Islands, especially of Guernsey.    My thanks are also due to Col. L'Estrange for the assistance he has  given me in egg-hunting, and also to Captain Hubback for his notes from  Alderney during the times he was quartered there.          BIRDS OF GUERNSEY.      1. WHITE-TAILED EAGLE. _Haliaeetus albicilla_, Linnsaeus. French, \"Aigle  pygarque,\" \"Pygarque ordinaire.\"--The White-tailed Eagle is an  occasional but by no means uncommon visitant to all the Islands. I have  seen specimens from Alderney, Guernsey, and Herm, and have heard of its  having been killed in Sark more than once. It usually occurs in the  autumn, and, as a rule, has a very short lease of life after its arrival  in the Islands, which is not to be wondered at, as it is considered, and  no doubt is, mischievous both to sheep and poultry; and in so thickly  populated a country, where every one carries a gun, a large bird like  the White-tailed Eagle can hardly escape notice and consequent  destruction for any length of time. It might, however, if unmolested,  occasionally remain throughout the winter, and probably sometimes  wanders to the Islands at that time, as Mr. Harvie Brown records  ('Zoologist' for 1869, p. 1591) one as having been killed, poisoned by  strychnine, in Herm in the month of January. This was, no doubt, a late  winter visitant, as it is hardly possible that the bird can have escaped  for so long a time, as it would have done had it visited the Islands at  its usual time, October or November. All the Channel Island specimens of  the White-tailed Eagle which I have seen have been young birds of the  first or second year, in the immature plumage in which the bird is known  as the Sea Eagle of Bewick, and in which it is occasionally mistaken for  the Golden Eagle, which bird has never, I believe, occurred in the  Islands. Of course in the adult plumage, when this bird has its white  tail and head, no such mistake could occur, but in the immature plumage  in which the bird usually makes its appearance such a mistake does  occasionally happen, and afterwards it becomes difficult to convince the  owner that he has not a Golden Eagle; in fact he usually feels rather  insulted when told of his mistake, and ignores all suggestions of  anything like an infallible test, so it may be as well to mention that  the birds may be distinguished in any state of plumage and at any age by  the tarsus, which in the White-tailed Eagle is bare of feathers and in  the Golden Eagle is feathered to the junction of the toes. I have one in  my possession shot at Bordeaux harbour on the 14th of November, 1871,  and I saw one in the flesh at Mr. Couch's, the bird-stuffer, which had  been shot at Alderney on the 2nd of November in the same year; and Mr.  MacCulloch writes to me that one was wounded and taken alive in the  parish of the Forest in Guernsey in 1845. It was said to be one of a  pair, and he adds--\"I have known several instances of its appearance  since both here (Guernsey) and in Herm,\" but unluckily he gives no dates  and could not remember at what time of year any of the occurrences he  had noted had taken place. This is to be regretted, as although the bird  occurs almost every autumn--indeed, so frequently as to render mention  of further instances of its occurrence at that time of year  unnecessary--its occurrence in the spring is rare, and some of those  noted by Mr. MacCulloch might have been at that time of year. As it is,  I only know of one spring occurrence, and that was reported to me by Mr.  Couch as having taken place at Herm on the 23rd of March, 1877.    The White-tailed Eagle is included in Professor Ansted's list, but its  range in the Islands is restricted to Guernsey. There is one in the  museum, probably killed in Guernsey, in the plumage in which the Channel  Island specimens usually occur, but no note is given as to locality or  date.      2. OSPREY. _Pandion halioeetus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Balbusard.\"--I have  never met with the Osprey myself in the Channel Islands, nor have I, as  far as I remember, seen a Channel Island specimen. I include it,  however, on the authority of a note kindly sent to me by Mr. MacCulloch,  who says:--\"An Osprey was shot at St. Samsons, in Guernsey, on the 29th  of October, 1868. I cannot, however, say whether at the time it was  examined by a competent naturalist, and as both the Osprey and the  White-tailed Eagle are fishers, a mistake may have been made in naming  it.\" Of course such a mistake as suggested is possible, but as the  Guernsey fishermen and gunners, especially the St. Samsons men, are well  acquainted with the White-tailed Eagle, I should not think it probable  that the mistake had been made. The bird, however, cannot be considered  at all common in the Islands; there is no specimen in the Guernsey  Museum, and Mr. Couch has never mentioned to me having had one through  his hands, or recorded it in the 'Zoologist,' as he would have done had  he had one; neither does Mrs. Jago (late Miss Cumber), who used to do a  good deal of stuffing in Guernsey about thirty years ago, remember  having had one through her hands. There can be no reason, however, why  it should not occasionally occur in the Islands, as it does so both on  the French and English side of the Channel. The wonder rather is that it  is so rare as it appears to be.    The Osprey, however, is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and only  marked as occurring in Guernsey.      3. GREENLAND FALCON. _Falco candicans_, Gmelin.--I was much surprised  on my last visit to Alderney, on the 27th of June, 1878, on going into a  small carpenter's shop in the town, whose owner, besides being a  carpenter, is also an amateur bird-stuffer, though of the roughest  description, to find, amongst the dust of his shop, not only the Purple  Heron, which I went especially to see, and which is mentioned  afterwards, but a young Greenland Falcon which he informed me had been  shot in that island about eighteen months ago. This statement was  afterwards confirmed by the person who shot the bird, who was sent for  and came in whilst I was still in the shop. Unfortunately, neither the  carpenter nor his friend who shot the bird had made any note of the  date, and could only remember that the one had shot the bird in that  Island about eighteen months ago and the other had stuffed it  immediately after. This would bring it to the winter of 1876-77, or,  more probably, the late autumn of 1876. In the course of conversation it  appeared to me that the Snow Falcon--as they called this bird--was not  entirely unknown to the carpenter or his friend, though neither could  remember at the time another instance of one having been killed in that  Island. It is, however, by no means improbable that either this species  or the next mentioned, or both, may have occurred in the Islands before,  as Professor Ansted, though he gives no date or locality, includes the  Gyr Falcon in his list of Channel Island birds. As all three of the  large northern white Falcons were at one time included under the name of  Gyr Falcons, and, as Professor Ansted gives no description of the bird  mentioned by him, it is impossible to say to which species he alluded.  We may fairly conclude, however, that it was either the present species  or the Iceland Falcon, as it could hardly have been the darker and less  wandering species, the Norway Falcon, the true Gyr Falcon of falconers,  _Falco gyrfalco_ of Linnaeus, which does not wander so far from its  native home, and has never yet, as far as is at present known, occurred  in any part of the British Islands, and certainly not so far south as  the Channel Islands. This latter, indeed, is an extremely southern  latitude for either the Greenland or Iceland"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#3)"],[1,"  examine it. I have here a substance which is rather porous--a column of  salt--and I will pour into the plate at the bottom, not water, as it  appears, but a saturated solution of salt which cannot absorb more; so  that the action which you see will not be due to its dissolving anything.  We may consider the plate to be the candle, and the salt the wick, and  this solution the melted tallow. (I have coloured the fluid, that you may  see the action better.) You observe that, now I pour in the fluid, it  rises and gradually creeps up the salt higher and higher; and provided the  column does not tumble over, it will go to the top.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    If this blue solution were combustible, and we were to place a wick at the  top of the salt, it would burn as it entered into the wick. It is a most  curious thing to see this kind of action taking place, and to observe how  singular some of the circumstances are about it. When you wash your hands,  you take a towel to wipe off the water; and it is by that kind of wetting,  or that kind of attraction which makes the towel become wet with water,  that the wick is made wet with the tallow. I have known some careless boys  and girls (indeed, I have known it happen to careful people as well) who,  having washed their hands and wiped them with a towel, have thrown the  towel over the side of the basin, and before long it has drawn all the  water out of the basin and conveyed it to the floor, because it happened  to be thrown over the side in such a way as to serve the purpose of a  syphon.[5] That you may the better see the way in which the substances act  one upon another, I have here a vessel made of wire gauze filled with  water, and you may compare it in its action to the cotton in one respect,  or to a piece of calico in the other. In fact, wicks are sometimes made of  a kind of wire gauze. You will observe that this vessel is a porous thing;  for if I pour a little water on to the top, it will run out at the bottom.  You would be puzzled for a good while if I asked you what the state of  this vessel is, what is inside it, and why it is there? The vessel is full  of water, and yet you see the water goes in and runs out as if it were  empty. In order to prove this to you, I have only to empty it. The reason  is this,--the wire, being once wetted, remains wet; the meshes are so  small that the fluid is attracted so strongly from the one side to the  other, as to remain in the vessel although it is porous. In like manner  the particles of melted tallow ascend the cotton and get to the top; other  particles then follow by their mutual attraction for each other, and as  they reach the flame they are gradually burned.    Here is another application of the same principle. You see this bit of  cane. I have seen boys about the streets, who are very anxious to appear  like men, take a piece of cane, and light it and smoke it, as an imitation  of a cigar. They are enabled to do so by the permeability of the cane in  one direction, and by its capillarity. If I place this piece of cane on a  plate containing some camphin (which is very much like paraffin in its  general character), exactly in the same manner as the blue fluid rose  through the salt will this fluid rise through the piece of cane. There  being no pores at the side, the fluid cannot go in that direction, but  must pass through its length. Already the fluid is at the top of the cane:  now I can light it and make it serve as a candle. The fluid has risen by  the capillary attraction of the piece of cane, just as it does through the  cotton in the candle.    Now, the only reason why the candle does not burn all down the side of the  wick is, that the melted tallow extinguishes the flame. You know that a  candle, if turned upside down, so as to allow the fuel to run upon the  wick, will be put out. The reason is, that the flame has not had time to  make the fuel hot enough to burn, as it does above, where it is carried in  small quantities into the wick, and has all the effect of the heat  exercised upon it.    There is another condition which you must learn as regards the candle,  without which you would not be able fully to understand the philosophy of  it, and that is the vaporous condition of the fuel.  In order that you may  understand that, let me shew you a very pretty, but very common-place  experiment. If you blow a candle out cleverly, you will see the vapour  rise from it. You have, I know, often smelt the vapour of a blown-out  candle--and a very bad smell it is; but if you blow it out cleverly, you  will be able to see pretty well the vapour into which this solid matter is  transformed.  I will blow out one of these candles in such a way as not to  disturb the air around it, by the continuing action of my breath; and now,  if I hold a lighted taper two or three inches from the wick, you will  observe a train of fire going through the air till it reaches the candle.  I am obliged to be quick and ready, because, if I allow the vapour time to  cool, it becomes condensed into a liquid or solid, or the stream of  combustible matter gets disturbed.    Now, as to the shape or form of the flame. It concerns us much to know  about the condition which the matter of the candle finally assumes at the  top of the wick--where you have such beauty and brightness as nothing but  combustion or flame can produce.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    You have the glittering beauty of gold and silver, and the still higher  lustre of jewels, like the ruby and diamond; but none of these rival the  brilliancy and beauty of flame. What diamond can shine like flame? It owes  its lustre at night-time to the very flame shining upon it. The flame  shines in darkness, but the light which the diamond has is as nothing  until the flame shine upon it, when it is brilliant again. The candle  alone shines by itself, and for itself, or for those who have arranged the  materials. Now, let us look a little at the form of the flame as you see  it under the glass shade. It is steady and equal; and its general form is  that which is represented in the diagram, varying with atmospheric  disturbances, and also varying according to the size of the candle. It is  a bright oblong--brighter at the top than towards the bottom--with the  wick in the middle, and besides the wick in the middle, certain darker  parts towards the bottom, where the ignition is not so perfect as in the  part above.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    I have a drawing here, sketched many years ago by Hooke, when he made his  investigations. It is the drawing of the flame of a lamp, but it will  apply to the flame of a candle. The cup of the candle is the vessel or  lamp, the melted spermaceti is the oil, and the wick is common to both.  Upon that he sets this little flame, and then he represents what is  true--a certain quantity of matter rising about it which you do not see,  and which, if you have not been here before, or are not familiar with the  subject, you will not know of. He has here represented the parts of the  surrounding atmosphere that are very essential to the flame, and that are  always present with it. There is a current formed, which draws the flame  out--for the flame which you see is really drawn out by the current, and  drawn upward to a great height--just as Hooke has here shewn you by that  prolongation of the current in the diagram. You may see this by taking a  lighted candle, and putting it in the sun so as to get its shadow thrown  on a piece of paper. How remarkable it is that that thing which is light  enough to produce shadows of other objects, can be made to throw its own  shadow on a piece of white paper or card, so that you can actually see  streaming round the flame something which is not part of the flame, but is  ascending and drawing the flame upwards. Now, I am going to imitate the  sunlight, by applying the voltaic battery to the electric lamp. You now  see our sun, and its great luminosity; and by placing a candle between it  and the screen, we get the shadow of the flame.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    You observe the shadow of the candle and of the wick; then there is a  darkish part, as represented in the diagram, and then a part which is more  distinct. Curiously enough, however, what we see in the shadow as the  darkest part of the flame is, in reality, the brightest part; and here you  see streaming upwards the ascending current of hot air, as shewn by  Hooke, which draws out the flame, supplies it with air, and cools the  sides of the cup of melted fuel.    I can give you here a little further illustration, for the purpose of  shewing you how flame goes up or down; according to the current. I have  here a flame--it is not a candle flame--but you can, no doubt, by this  time, generalise enough to be able to compare one thing with another. What  I am about to do is to change the ascending current that takes the flame  upwards into a descending current. This I can easily do by the little  apparatus you see before me. The flame, as I have said, is not a candle  flame, but it is produced by alcohol, so that it shall not smoke too much.  I will also colour the flame with another substance[6], so that you may  trace its course; for with the spirit alone you could hardly see well  enough to have the opportunity of tracing its direction. By lighting this  spirit-of-wine, we have then a flame produced; and you observe that when  held in the air, it naturally goes upwards.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    You understand now easily enough why flames go up under ordinary  circumstances--it is because of the draught of air by which the combustion  is formed. But now, by blowing the flame down, you see I am enabled to  make it go downwards into this little chimney--the direction of the  current being changed. Before we have concluded this course of lectures,  we shall shew you a lamp in which the flame goes up and the smoke goes  down, or the flame"]]]
