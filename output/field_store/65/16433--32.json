Or else the meaning of your Request must be  this, that I should shew you after what manner they proceed, who give  themselves to Contemplation. And this (my good Friend) is a thing which  is capable of being express'd both by Speech, and Writing; but 'tis as  scarce as old Gold, especially in this part of the World where we live;  for 'tis so rare, that there's hardly one of a thousand gets so much as  a smattering of it; and of those few, scarce any, have communicated any  thing of what they knew in that kind, but only by obscure Hints, and  _Innuendo_'s. Indeed the _Hanifitick_ Sect[11], and the Mahometan  Religion, doe forbid Men to dive too far into this matter. Nor would I  have you think that the Philosophy which we find in the Books of  _Aristotle_, and _Alpharabius_[12], and in _Avicenna_'s Book, which he  calls _Alshepha,_ does answer the end which you aim at, nor have any of  the _Spanish_ Philosophers[13] writ fully and satisfactorily about it.  Because those Scholars which were bred in _Spain_, before the Knowledge  of Logick and Philosophy was broach'd amongst them, spent their whole  Lives in Mathematicks, in which it must be allow'd, they made a great  Progress, but went no farther. After them came a Generation of Men, who  apply'd themselves more to the Art of Reasoning, in which they excell'd  their Predecessors, yet not so as to attain to true Perfection. So that  one of them said,         _T'is hard the kinds of Knowledge are but two,_           _The One erroneous, the Other true_.       _The former profits nothing when 'tis gain'd,_           _The other's difficult to be attain'd_.    After these came others, who still advanc'd further, and made nearer  approaches to the Truth; among whom there was one that had a sharper  Wit, or truer notions of things than _Avenpace_, but he was too much  taken up with Worldly Business, and Died before he had time to open the  Treasury of his Knowledge, so that most of those pieces of his which are  extant, are imperfect; particularly his Book _about the Soul_) and his  _Tedbiro 'lmotawahhid,_ i.e. _How a Man ought to manage himself that  leads a Solitary Life_ So are his _Logicks_ and _Physicks_. Those Pieces  of his which are compleat, are only short Tracts and some occasional  Letters. Nay, in his Epistle concerning the _UNION_, he himself  confesses that he had wrote nothing compleat, where he says, _That it  would require a great deal of trouble and pains to express that clearly  which he had undertaken to prove_; and, _that the method which he had  made use of in explaining himself, was not in many places so exact as it  might have been_; and, _that he design'd, if he had time, to alter it_.  So much for _Avenpace_, I for my part never saw him, and as for his  Contemporaries, they were far inferiour to him, nor did I ever see any  of their Works. Those who are now alive, are, either such as are still  advancing forwards, or else such as have left off, without attaining to  perfection; if there are any other, I know nothing of them.    As to those Works of _Alpharabius_ which are extant, they are most of  them _Logick_. There are a great many things very dubious in his  Philosophical Works; for in his _Mellatolphadelah_, i.e. _The most  excellent Sect_, he asserts expressly, _that the Souls of Wicked Men  shall suffer everlasting Punishment_; and yet says as positively in his  Politicks that they shall be dissolv'd and annihilated, and that the  Souls of the Perfect shall remain for ever. And then in his _Ethicks_,  speaking concerning the Happiness of Man, he says, _that it is only in  this Life_, and then adds, _that whatsoever People talk of besides, is  meer Whimsy and old Wives Fables_. A principle, which if believ'd would  make all Men despair of the Mercy of God, and puts the Good and Evil  both upon the same Level, in that it makes annihilation the common end  to them both. This is an Error not to be pardon'd by any means, or made  amends for. Besides all this, he had a mean Opinion of the Gift of  Prophecy, and said that in his Judgment it did belong to the _faculty of  Imagination_, and that he prefer'd Philosophy before it; with a great  many other things of the like nature, not necessary to be mention'd  here.    As for the Books of _Aristotle, Avicenna_'s Exposition of them in his  _Alshepha_ [i.e. _Health_] supplies their Room, for he trod in the same  steps and was of the same Sect. In the beginning of that Book, says,  that the _Truth_ was in his opinion different from what he had there  deliver'd, that he had written that Book according to the Philosophy of  the _Peripateticks_; but those that would know the _Truth_ clearly, and  without Obscurity, he refers to his Book, _Of the Eastern Philosophy_.  Now he that takes the pains to compare his _Alshepha_ with what  _Aristotle_ has written, will find they agree in most things, tho' in  the _Alshepha_ there are a great many things which are not extant in any  of those pieces which we have of _Aristotle_. But if the Reader, take  the literal Sense only, either of the _Alshepha_ or _Aristotle_, with,  out penetrating into the hidden Sense, he will never attain to  perfection, as _Avicenna_ himself observes in the _Alshepha_.    As for _Algazali_[14], he often contradicts himself, denying in one  place what he affirm'd in another. He taxes the Philosophers with  _Heresy_[15] in his Book which he calls _Altehaphol_, i.e.  _Destruction_, because they deny the Resurrection of the Body, and hold  that Rewards and Punishments in a Future State belong to the Soul only.  Then in the beginning of his _Almizan_, i.e. _The Balance_, he affirms  positively, that this is the Doctrine of the _Suphians_[16], and that he  was convinc'd of the truth of it, after a great deal of Study and  Search. There are a great many such Contradictions as these interspers'd  in his Works; which he himself begs Pardon for in the end of his _Mizan  Alamal [The Ballance of Mens Actions]_; where he says, that there are  Three sorts of Opinions; 1. Such as are common to the Vulgar, and  agreeable to their Notions of things. 2. Such as we commonly make use of  in answering Questions propos'd to us. 3. Such private as a Man has to  himself, which none understand but those who think just as he does. And  then he adds, that tho' there were no more in what he had written than  only this, _viz_. That it made a Man doubt of those things which he had  imbib'd at first, and help'd him to remove the prejudices of Education,  that even that were sufficient; because, he that never doubts will never  weigh things aright, and he that does not do that will never see, hut  remain in Blindness and Confusion.         _Believe your Eyes, but still suspect your Ears,_       _You'll need no Star-light[17], when the day appears_.    This is the account of his way of Philosophizing, the greatest part of  which is enigmatical and full of obscurity, and for that reason of no  use to any but such as thoroughly perceive and understand the matter  before, and then afterwards hear it from him again, or at least such as  are of an excellent Capacity, and can apprehend a thing from the least  intimation. The same Author says in his _Aljawahir_ [i.e. _The Jewels_]  that he had Books not fit to be communicated, but to such only as were  qualified to read them, and that in them he had laid down the _Naked  Truth_; but none of them ever came into _Spain_ that we know of: we have  indeed had Books which some have imagin'd to be those incommunicable  ones he speaks of, but 'tis a mistake, for those are _Almaareph  Alakliyah [Intellectual notices]_ and the _Alnaphchi walteswiyal  [Inflation and AEquation]_ and besides these, _a Collection of several  Questions_. But as for these, tho' there are some hints in them, yet  they contain nothing of particular use to the clearing of things, but  what you may meet with in his other Books. There are, 'tis true, in his  _Almeksad Alasna_, some things which are more profound than what we meet  with in the rest of his Books, but he expressly says, that that Book is  not _incommunicable_; from whence it follows, those Books which are come  to our hands are not those incommunicable ones which he means. Some have  fancy'd that there were some great matters contain'd in that Discourse  of his, which is at the end of his _Meschal_ [i.e. _Casement_] (which  Belief of theirs, has plung'd them into inextricable Difficulties) where  speaking of the several sorts of those who are kept from nearer  Approaches, by the Brightness of the radiation of the Divine light, and  then of those who had attain'd to the _UNION_, he says of these later,  _That they apprehended such Attributes to belong to the Divine Essence  as were destructive of its Unity_; from, whence it appear'd to them that  he believ'd a sort of Multiplicity in the Godhead, which is horrid  Blasphemy. Now I make no Question but that the worthy Doctor _Algazali_  was one of those which attain'd to the utmost degree of Happiness, and  to those heights which are proper _to_ those who enjoy the _UNION_; but  as for his secret or incommunicable Books, which contain the manner of  _Revelation_, they never came to my hands: and that pitch of knowledge  which I have attain'd to, is owing to his other works and to _Avicenna_,  which I read and compar'd with the Opinions of the present Philosophers,  till at length I came to the Knowledge of the Truth. At first indeed, by  way of Enquiry and Contemplation;but afterwards I came to have a perfect  sense, and then I found that I could say something which I could call my  own. Now I was resolv'd that you should be the first, to whom I would  Communicate what I knew about these matters, both upon the account of  the Intimacy of our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#3)"],[1,"and adopt the hypothesis that the settlements established  there sent expeditions to the mainland and Borneo.[9] But the history  of Java is curiously fragmentary whereas the copious inscriptions of  Camboja and Champa combined with Chinese notices give a fairly  continuous chronicle. And a glance at the map will show that if there  were Hindu colonists at Ligor it would have been much easier for  them to go across the Gulf of Siam to Camboja than _via_ Java. I have  therefore not adopted the hypothesis of expansion from Java (while  also not rejecting it) nor followed any chronological method but have  treated of Camboja first, as being the Hindu state of which on the  whole we know most and then of Champa and Java in comparison with it.    In the later sections of the book I consider the expansion of Indian  influence in the north. A chapter on Central Asia endeavours to  summarize our rapidly increasing knowledge of this meeting place of  nations. Its history is closely connected with China and naturally  leads me to a somewhat extended review of the fortunes and  achievements of Buddhism in that great land, and also to a special  study of Tibet and of Lamaism. I have treated of Nepal elsewhere. For  the history of religion it is not a new province, but simply the  extreme north of the Indian region where the last phase of decadent  Indian Buddhism which practically disappeared in Bengal still retains  a nominal existence.

At one point a chain of smaller islands and rocks said to  have been built by Rama as a passage for his army of monkeys leads to  the mainland. It is therefore natural that the population should have  relations with southern India. Sinhalese art, religion and language  show traces of Tamil influence but it is somewhat surprising to find  that in these and in all departments of civilization the influence of  northern India is stronger. The traditions which explain the  connection of Ceylon with this distant region seem credible and the  Sinhalese, who were often at war with the Tamils, were not disposed to  imitate their usages, although juxtaposition and invasion brought  about much involuntary resemblance.    The school of Buddhism now professed in Ceylon, Burma and Siam is  often called Sinhalese and (provided it is not implied that its  doctrines originated in Ceylon) the epithet is correct. For the school  ceased to exist in India and in the middle ages both Burma and Siam  accepted the authority of the Sinhalese Sangha.[10] This Sinhalese  school seems to be founded on the doctrines and scriptures accepted in  the time of Asoka in Magadha and though the faith may have been  codified and supplemented in its new home, I see no evidence that it  underwent much corruption or even development. One is inclined at  first to think that the Hindus, having a continuous living tradition  connecting them with Gotama who was himself a Hindu, were more likely  than these distant islanders to preserve the spirit of his teaching.  But there is another side to the question. The Hindus being  addicted to theological and metaphysical studies produced original  thinkers who, if not able to found new religions, at least modified  what their predecessors had laid down. If certain old texts were held  in too high esteem to be neglected, the ingenuity of the commentator  rarely failed to reinterpret them as favourable to the views popular  in his time. But the Sinhalese had not this passion for theology. So  far as we can judge of them in earlier periods they were endowed with  an amiable and receptive but somewhat indolent temperament, moderate  gifts in art and literature and a moderate love and understanding of  theology. Also their chiefs claimed to have come from northern India  and were inclined to accept favourably anything which had the same  origin. These are exactly the surroundings in which a religion can  flourish without change for many centuries and Buddhism in Ceylon  acquired stability because it also acquired a certain national and  patriotic flavour: it was the faith of the Sinhalese and not of the  invading Tamils. Such Sinhalese kings as had the power protected the  Church and erected magnificent buildings for its service.    If Sinhalese tradition may be believed, the first historical contact  with northern India was the expedition of Vijaya, who with 700  followers settled in the island about the time of the Buddha's death.  Many details of the story are obviously invented. Thus in order to  explain why Ceylon is called Sinhala, Vijaya is made the grandson of  an Indian princess who lived with a lion. But though these legends  inspire mistrust, it is a fact that the language of Ceylon in its  earliest known form is a dialect closely connected with Pali (or  rather with the spoken dialect from which ecclesiastical Pali was  derived) and still more closely with the Maharashtri Prakrit of  western India. It is not however a derivative of this Prakrit but  parallel to it and in some words presents older forms.[11] It does not  seem possible to ascribe the introduction of this language to the  later mission of Mahinda, for, though Buddhist monks have in many  countries influenced literature and the literary vocabulary, no  instance is recorded of their changing the popular speech.[12] But  Vijaya is said to have conquered Ceylon and to have slaughtered  many of its ancient inhabitants, called Yakkhas,[13] of whom we  know little except that Sinhalese contains some un-Aryan words  probably borrowed from them. According to the Dipavamsa,[14]  Vijaya started from Bharukaccha or Broach and both language and such  historical facts as we know confirm the tradition that some time  before the third century B.C. Ceylon was conquered by Indian  immigrants from the west coast.    It would not be unreasonable to suppose that Vijaya introduced into  Ceylon the elements of Buddhism, but there is little evidence to  indicate that it was a conspicuous form of religion in India in his  time. Sinhalese tradition maintains that not only Gotama himself but  also the three preceding Buddhas were miraculously transported to  Ceylon and made arrangements for its conversion. Gotama is said to  have paid no less than three visits:[15] all are obviously impossible  and were invented to enhance the glory of the island. But the legends  which relate how Panduvasudeva came from India to succeed  Vijaya, how he subsequently had a Sakya princess brought over from  India to be his wife and how her brothers established cities in  Ceylon,[16] if not true in detail, are probably true in spirit in so  far as they imply that the Sinhalese kept up intercourse with India  and were familiar with the principal forms of Indian religion. Thus we  are told[17] that King Pandukabhaya built religious edifices for  Niganthas (Jains), Brahmans, Paribbajakas (possibly Buddhists)  and Ajivikas. When Devanampiya Tissa ascended the throne (_circ._ 245  B.C.) he sent a complimentary mission bearing wonderful treasures to  Asoka with whom he was on friendly terms, although they had never met.  This implies that the kingdom of Magadha was known and respected in  Ceylon, and we hear that the mission included a Brahman. The answer  attributed to Asoka will surprise no one acquainted with the  inscriptions of that pious monarch. He said that he had taken  refuge in the law of Buddha and advised the King of Ceylon to find  salvation in the same way. He also sent magnificent presents  consisting chiefly of royal insignia and Tissa was crowned for the  second time, which probably means that he became not only the disciple  but the vassal of Asoka.    In any case the records declare that the Indian Emperor showed the  greatest solicitude for the spiritual welfare of Ceylon and, though  they are obviously embellished, there is no reason to doubt their  substantial accuracy.[18] The Sinhalese tradition agrees on the whole  with the data supplied by Indian inscriptions and Chinese pilgrims.  The names of missionaries mentioned in the Dipa and Mahavamsas recur  on urns found at Sanchi and on its gateways are pictures in relief  which appear to represent the transfer of a branch of the Bo-tree in  solemn procession to some destination which, though unnamed, may be  conjectured to be Ceylon.[19] The absence of Mahinda's name in Asoka's  inscriptions is certainly suspicious, but the Sinhalese chronicles  give the names of other missionaries correctly and a mere _argumentum  ex silentio_ cannot disprove their testimony on this important point.
