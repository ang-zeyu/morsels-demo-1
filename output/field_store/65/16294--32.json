These men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that,  settled as they were in my principles, their lives were a manifest  contrast to the ways of the wicked. So there is nothing thou shouldst  wonder at, if on the seas of this life we are tossed by storm-blasts,  seeing that we have made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with  evil-doers. And though, maybe, the host of the wicked is many in number,  yet is it contemptible, since it is under no leadership, but is hurried  hither and thither at the blind driving of mad error. And if at times  and seasons they set in array against us, and fall on in overwhelming  strength, our leader draws off her forces into the citadel while they  are busy plundering the useless baggage. But we from our vantage ground,  safe from all this wild work, laugh to see them making prize of the most  valueless of things, protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may  not aspire to reach.'        SONG IV.    NOTHING CAN SUBDUE VIRTUE.          Whoso calm, serene, sedate,      Sets his foot on haughty fate;      Firm and steadfast, come what will,      Keeps his mien unconquered still;      Him the rage of furious seas,      Tossing high wild menaces,      Nor the flames from smoky forges      That Vesuvius disgorges,      Nor the bolt that from the sky      Smites the tower, can terrify.      Why, then, shouldst thou feel affright      At the tyrant's weakling might?      Dread him not, nor fear no harm,      And thou shall his rage disarm;      But who to hope or fear gives way--      Lost his bosom's rightful sway--      He hath cast away his shield,      Like a coward fled the field;      He hath forged all unaware      Fetters his own neck must bear!        IV.      'Dost thou understand?' she asks. Do my words sink into thy mind? Or art  thou dull \"as the ass to the sound of the lyre\"? Why dost thou weep? Why  do tears stream from thy eyes?        '\"Speak out, hide it not in thy heart.\"    If thou lookest for the physician's help, thou must needs disclose thy  wound.'    Then I, gathering together what strength I could, began: 'Is there still  need of telling? Is not the cruelty of fortune against me plain enough?  Doth not the very aspect of this place move thee? Is this the library,  the room which thou hadst chosen as thy constant resort in my home, the  place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all things in  heaven and earth? Was my garb and mien like this when I explored with  thee nature's hid secrets, and thou didst trace for me with thy wand  the courses of the stars, moulding the while my character and the whole  conduct of my life after the pattern of the celestial order? Is this the  recompense of my obedience? Yet thou hast enjoined by Plato's mouth the  maxim, \"that states would be happy, either if philosophers ruled them,  or if it should so befall that their rulers would turn philosophers.\" By  his mouth likewise thou didst point out this imperative reason why  philosophers should enter public life, to wit, lest, if the reins of  government be left to unprincipled and profligate citizens, trouble and  destruction should come upon the good. Following these precepts, I have  tried to apply in the business of public administration the principles  which I learnt from thee in leisured seclusion. Thou art my witness and  that divinity who hath implanted thee in the hearts of the wise, that I  brought to my duties no aim but zeal for the public good. For this cause  I have become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds, and, as  happens inevitably, if a man holds fast to the independence of  conscience, I have had to think nothing of giving offence to the  powerful in the cause of justice. How often have I encountered and  balked Conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes of the weak? How often  have I thwarted Trigguilla, steward of the king's household, even when  his villainous schemes were as good as accomplished? How often have I  risked my position and influence to protect poor wretches from the false  charges innumerable with which they were for ever being harassed by the  greed and license of the barbarians? No one has ever drawn me aside from  justice to oppression. When ruin was overtaking the fortunes of the  provincials through the combined pressure of private rapine and public  taxation, I grieved no less than the sufferers. When at a season of  grievous scarcity a forced sale, disastrous as it was unjustifiable, was  proclaimed, and threatened to overwhelm Campania with starvation, I  embarked on a struggle with the praetorian prefect in the public  interest, I fought the case at the king's judgment-seat, and succeeded  in preventing the enforcement of the sale. I rescued the consular  Paulinus from the gaping jaws of the court bloodhounds, who in their  covetous hopes had already made short work of his wealth. To save  Albinus, who was of the same exalted rank, from the penalties of a  prejudged charge, I exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian, the  informer.    'Thinkest thou I had laid up for myself store of enmities enough? Well,  with the rest of my countrymen, at any rate, my safety should have been  assured, since my love of justice had left me no hope of security at  court. Yet who was it brought the charges by which I have been struck  down? Why, one of my accusers is Basil, who, after being dismissed from  the king's household, was driven by his debts to lodge an information  against my name. There is Opilio, there is Gaudentius, men who for many  and various offences the king's sentence had condemned to banishment;  and when they declined to obey, and sought to save themselves by taking  sanctuary, the king, as soon as he heard of it, decreed that, if they  did not depart from the city of Ravenna within a prescribed time, they  should be branded on the forehead and expelled. What would exceed the  rigour of this severity? And yet on that same day these very men lodged  an information against me, and the information was admitted. Just  Heaven! had I deserved this by my way of life? Did it make them fit  accusers that my condemnation was a foregone conclusion? Has fortune no  shame--if not at the accusation of the innocent, at least for the  vileness of the accusers? Perhaps thou wonderest what is the sum of the  charges laid against me? I wished, they say, to save the senate. But  how? I am accused of hindering an informer from producing evidence to  prove the senate guilty of treason. Tell me, then, what is thy counsel,  O my mistress. Shall I deny the charge, lest I bring shame on thee? But  I did wish it, and I shall never cease to wish it. Shall I admit it?  Then the work of thwarting the informer will come to an end. Shall I  call the wish for the preservation of that illustrious house a crime?  Of a truth the senate, by its decrees concerning me, has made it such!  But blind folly, though it deceive itself with false names, cannot alter  the true merits of things, and, mindful of the precept of Socrates, I do  not think it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood  to pass. But this, however it may be, I leave to thy judgment and to the  verdict of the discerning. Moreover, lest the course of events and the  true facts should be hidden from posterity, I have myself committed to  writing an account of the transaction.    'What need to speak of the forged letters by which an attempt is made to  prove that I hoped for the freedom of Rome? Their falsity would have  been manifest, if I had been allowed to use the confession of the  informers themselves, evidence which has in all matters the most  convincing force. Why, what hope of freedom is left to us? Would there  were any! I should have answered with the epigram of Canius when  Caligula declared him to have been cognisant of a conspiracy against  him. \"If I had known,\" said he, \"thou shouldst never have known.\" Grief  hath not so blunted my perceptions in this matter that I should complain  because impious wretches contrive their villainies against the virtuous,  but at their achievement of their hopes I do exceedingly marvel. For  evil purposes are, perchance, due to the imperfection of human nature;  that it should be possible for scoundrels to carry out their worst  schemes against the innocent, while God beholdeth, is verily monstrous.  For this cause, not without reason, one of thy disciples asked, \"If God  exists, whence comes evil? Yet whence comes good, if He exists not?\"  However, it might well be that wretches who seek the blood of all honest  men and of the whole senate should wish to destroy me also, whom they  saw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest men. But did I deserve  such a fate from the Fathers also? Thou rememberest, methinks--since  thou didst ever stand by my side to direct what I should do or say--thou  rememberest, I say, how at Verona, when the king, eager for the general  destruction, was bent on implicating the whole senatorial order in the  charge of treason brought against Albinus, with what indifference to my  own peril I maintained the innocence of its members, one and all. Thou  knowest that what I say is the truth, and that I have never boasted of  my good deeds in a spirit of self-praise. For whenever a man by  proclaiming his good deeds receives the recompense of fame, he  diminishes in a measure the secret reward of a good conscience. What  issues have overtaken my innocency thou seest. Instead of reaping the  rewards of true virtue, I undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely laid  to my charge--nay, more than this; never did an open confession of guilt  cause such unanimous severity among the assessors, but that some  consideration, either of the mere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#3)"],[1,"revere their art? We are told of Chopin  that art was for him a high and holy vocation.[8] Do you wonder? Let  me read you a few words about his devotion: \"In order to become a  skilful and able master he studied, without dreaming of the ... fame  he would obtain.\" \"Nothing could be purer, more exalted, than his  thoughts,\"[9] because he knew that if his thoughts were not pure the  impurity would come out in his music.    The music that has first been felt in the heart and then written down  finds its way and tells all about the heart, where it was born. When  you play and feel that you are playing from the heart, you may be sure  you are on the right path. The beautiful thing is, that this is true  no matter how simple music is. The very simplest will tell all about  us. Remember, in playing music, that great and good men have put into  tones thoughts which will be a joy and comfort to the world forever.  Some one of these Talks will be about classic and common music. But  even now I am sure we understand that good music comes from pure  thought, and pure thought comes from a good heart. That, surely, is  clear and simple.    Pure music is earnest and songful. It has meaning in every part. No  tone is without a lofty purpose. That is true music. It is classic  from the heart that is put into it.    By being faithful to our music it will do for us more than we can  dream. Do you know the inscription that used to be over the north gate  of the city of Siena, in Italy?    \"Siena opens not only her gates, but her heart to you.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE TONES ABOUT US.      \"Scientific education ought to teach us to see the invisible as well  as the visible in nature.\"--_John Tyndall_.[10]    There used to live in England a famous scientist named Tyndall, who  was interested, among other things, in the study of sound. He studied  sounds of all kinds, made experiments with them, wrote down what he  observed, and out of it all he wrote a book,[11] useful to all who  desire to learn about sound and its nature.    One day, Tyndall and a friend were walking up one of the mountains of  the Alps.[12] As they ascended the path, Tyndall's attention was  attracted by a shrill sound, which seemed to come from the ground at  his feet. Being a trained thinker he was at once curious to know what  was the cause of this. By looking carefully he found that it came from  a myriad of small insects which swarmed by the side of the path.  Having satisfied himself as to what it was he spoke to his companion  about the shrill tone and was surprised to learn that he could not  hear it. Tyndall's friend could hear all ordinary sound perfectly  well. This, however, seemed to be sound of such a character as did not  reach his sense of hearing. One who like Tyndall listened carefully to  sounds of all kinds would quickly detect anything uncommon. This  little incident teaches us that sounds may go on about us and yet we  know nothing of them. Also it teaches us to think about tones, seek  them, and in the first days increase our acquaintance and familiarity  with them.    Men of science, who study the different ways in which the mind works,  tell us that habit and also a busy mind frequently make us unconscious  of many things about us. Sometimes we have not noticed the clock  strike, although we have been in the room on the hour; or some one  speaks to us, and because we are thinking of something else we fail to  hear what is said to us. It certainly is true that very many people do  not hear half of the sounds that go on about them, sounds which, if  but heeded, would teach people a great deal. And of all people, those  who study music should be particularly attentive to sounds of all  kinds. Indeed, the only way to begin a music education is to begin by  learning to listen. Robert Schumann, a German composer, once wrote a  set of rules for young musicians. As it was Schumann's habit to write  only what was absolutely needed we may be sure he regarded his rules  as very important. There are sixty-eight of them, and the very first  has reference to taking particular notice of the tones about us. If we  learn it from memory we shall understand it better and think of it  oftener. Besides that, we shall have memorized the serious thought of  a truly good and great man. This is what he says:    \"The cultivation of the ear is of the greatest importance. Endeavor  early to distinguish each tone and key. Find out the exact tone  sounded by the bell, the glass, and the cuckoo.\"    There is certainly a good hint in this. Let us follow it day by day,  and we shall see how many are the tones about us which we scarcely  ever notice. We should frequently listen and find who of us can  distinguish the greatest number of different sounds. Then we shall  learn to listen attentively to sounds and noises. Bit by bit all  sounds, especially beautiful ones, will take on a new and deeper  meaning to us; they will be full of a previously unrecognized beauty  which will teach us to love music more and more sincerely.    In order that we may better understand how sounds are related to each  other we should learn early to sing the major scale so that it will go  readily up and down as a melody. As we become more and more familiar  with it we must think frequently of its separate tones so as to feel  just how each one sounds in the scale, how it fits in the scale, and  just what it says, in fact; we shall then notice after a while that we  can hear the scale with the inner ear, which is finer and more  delicate.[13]    We should have names for the scale-tones like the pretty Italian  syllables, or, if not these, whatever our teacher suggests. Then we  should have a conception of the tones as they are related. We should  learn that every tone of the scale is colored by the tonic. Every one  gets a character from the tonic which tells us all about it, because  we learn to hear its relation to its principal tone. In a little  while, with patience, we shall be able to hear the scale-tones in any  order we may choose to think them. That power will be a fine help  forever after--we must be sure to get it in the first days.    Whenever we hear two tones we should try to find them on the piano.  This will make us listen more attentively to the tone sounded by the  clock, the church-bell, the bird, the drinking-glass. And what a lot  there are, like the squeaking door, the cricket, the noise of the wind  and rain, the puff of the engine, and all the other sounds we hear in  a day. Bit by bit, in this way, our familiarity with tones will grow  and we shall be well repaid for all the trouble. Gradually we shall  become better listeners--but about listening we are to speak in our  next Talk. This, however, may be said now: Let us always be sure to  listen with special care to two tones, calling one the tonic, or  first, of the major scale and finding what degree the other is, or  near what degree it lies. This will make us better acquainted with the  scale and we shall learn that all the music we have comes out of it.    We must also listen to tones so that we can tell something about them  besides their scale names. We must learn to describe tones, tell  whether they are high or low, sweet or harsh, loud or soft, long or  short. For instance, through the window I can hear a church-bell. Some  one is ringing it slowly so that the tones are long. The tone is not a  very high one (it is G above middle C) and the quality is rich and  mellow. This describes the church-bell tone quite well, and in like  manner we may describe all the sounds we hear. We should make it a  habit often to stand or to sit perfectly still and to listen to  everything that goes on about us. Even in the country, where all seems  as quiet as possible, we shall be surprised at the great number of  sounds.    There are some other tones to which I fear we are prone not to listen.  I mean the tones which the piano makes when we play finger-exercises.  We think perhaps of the finger motion, which is not all; or we think  of nothing, which is very bad; or our thoughts begin to picture other  things even while we play, which is the worst of all, and bit by bit  we actually forget what we are doing. One of the quickest ways to  become unable to hear sounds correctly is to play the piano without  thinking fully of what we are doing. Therefore it must be a rule never  to play a tone without listening acutely to it. If in the first days  we determine to do this and remain faithful to it, we shall always  touch the piano keys carefully, thoughtfully, and reverentially.    Elsewhere we shall have some definite tone lessons for the purpose of  making us familiar with the tones about us. But no rule can exceed in  importance this one, never to make any music unthinkingly.    By care and practice we soon become so skilful as to notice tones with  the readiness we notice colors in the garden. The sense of tone must  be as strong in us as is the sense of color. Then we shall be able to  tell differences of tones which are nearly the same, as readily as we  can now tell two varieties of yellow, for instance. A bit of  perseverance in this and the beauties even of common sounds shall be  revealed to us.          CHAPTER V.    LISTENING.        \"You must listen as if listening were your life.\"--_Phillips    Brooks._[14]    In our last Talk we learned that it was quite possible for sounds to  be about us and yet we not hear them. Sometimes, as in the case of  Tyndall's companion, it is because we are not capable; at other times,  as when the clock strikes and we do not hear, it is because we are  occupied with other things. It is from this latter fact--being  occupied with other things--that we can learn what listening is.  Listening is not being occupied with other things. It is being  completely attentive to what we are expected to hear.    The condition of being occupied with other thoughts when we should be"]]]
