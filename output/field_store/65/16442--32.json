[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#3)"],[1,"have been revealed in the Bible concerning the signs of the  coming Revelation. As she never grasped their true significance, and, to  outward seeming, such events never came to pass, she, therefore, remained  deprived of recognizing the beauty of Jesus and of beholding the face of  God. And they still await His coming! From time immemorial even unto this  day, all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful  and unseemly thoughts, and thus have deprived themselves of the clear  waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness.    In unfolding these mysteries, We have, in Our former Tablets which were  addressed to a friend in the melodious language of Hijaz, cited a few of  the verses revealed unto the Prophets of old. And now, responding to your  request, We again shall cite, in these pages, those same verses, uttered  this time in the wondrous accents of 'Iraq, that haply the sore athirst in  the wilds of remoteness may attain unto the ocean of the divine presence,  and they that languish in the wastes of separation be led unto the home of  eternal reunion. Thus the mists of error may be dispelled, and the  all-resplendent light of divine guidance dawn forth above the horizon of  human hearts. In God We put Our trust, and to Him We cry for help, that  haply there may flow from this pen that which shall quicken the souls of  men, that they may all arise from their beds of heedlessness and hearken  unto the rustling of the leaves of Paradise, from the tree which the hand  of divine power hath, by the permission of God, planted in the Ridvan of  the All-Glorious.    To them that are endowed with understanding, it is clear and manifest that  when the fire of the love of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish  limitations, and His authority was made apparent and partially enforced,  He the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples,  referred unto His passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of  bereavement, said unto them: \"I go away and come again unto you.\" And in  another place He said: \"I go and another will come Who will tell you all  that I have not told you, and will fulfil all that I have said.\" Both  these sayings have but one meaning, were you to ponder upon the  Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight.    Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the  Qur'an both the Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed. As to the  matter of names, Muhammad, Himself, declared: \"I am Jesus.\" He recognized  the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and testified that  they were all of God. In this sense, neither the person of Jesus nor His  writings hath differed from that of Muhammad and of His holy Book,  inasmuch as both have championed the Cause of God, uttered His praise, and  revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus, Himself, declared: \"I go  away and come again unto you.\" Consider the sun. Were it to say now, \"I am  the sun of yesterday,\" it would speak the truth. And should it, bearing  the sequence of time in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still  would speak the truth. In like manner, if it be said that all the days are  but one and the same, it is correct and true. And if it be said, with  respect to their particular names and designations, that they differ, that  again is true. For though they are the same, yet one doth recognize in  each a separate designation, a specific attribute, a particular character.  Conceive accordingly the distinction, variation, and unity characteristic  of the various Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the  allusions made by the creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries  of distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy question as to  why that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself  by different names and titles.    Afterwards, the companions and disciples of Jesus asked Him concerning  those signs that must needs signalize the return of His manifestation.  When, they asked, shall these things be? Several times they questioned  that peerless Beauty, and, every time He made reply, He set forth a  special sign that should herald the advent of the promised Dispensation.  To this testify the records of the four Gospels.    This wronged One will cite but one of these instances, thus conferring  upon mankind, for the sake of God, such bounties as are yet concealed  within the treasury of the hidden and sacred Tree, that haply mortal men  may not remain deprived of their share of the immortal fruit, and attain  to a dewdrop of the waters of everlasting life which, from Baghdad, the  \"Abode of Peace,\" are being vouchsafed unto all mankind. We ask for  neither meed nor reward. \"We nourish your souls for the sake of God; we  seek from you neither recompense nor thanks.\"(16) This is the food that  conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the illumined in  spirit. This is the bread of which it is said: \"Lord, send down upon us  Thy bread from heaven.\"(17) This bread shall never be withheld from them  that deserve it, nor can it ever be exhausted. It groweth everlastingly  from the tree of grace; it descendeth at all seasons from the heavens of  justice and mercy. Even as He saith: \"Seest thou not to what God likeneth  a good word? To a good tree; its root firmly fixed, and its branches  reaching unto heaven: yielding its fruit in all seasons.\"(18)    O the pity! that man should deprive himself of this goodly gift, this  imperishable bounty, this everlasting life. It behooveth him to prize this  food that cometh from heaven, that perchance, through the wondrous favours  of the Sun of Truth, the dead may be brought to life, and withered souls  be quickened by the infinite Spirit. Make haste, O my brother, that while  there is yet time our lips may taste of the immortal draught, for the  breeze of life, now blowing from the city of the Well-Beloved, cannot  last, and the streaming river of holy utterance must needs be stilled, and  the portals of the Ridvan cannot for ever remain open. The day will surely  come when the Nightingale of Paradise will have winged its flight away  from its earthly abode unto its heavenly nest. Then will its melody be  heard no more, and the beauty of the rose cease to shine. Seize the time,  therefore, ere the glory of the divine springtime hath spent itself, and  the Bird of Eternity ceased to warble its melody, that thy inner hearing  may not be deprived of hearkening unto its call. This is My counsel unto  thee and unto the beloved of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him turn  thereunto; whosoever wisheth, let him turn away. God, verily, is  independent of him and of that which he may see and witness.    These are the melodies, sung by Jesus, Son of Mary, in accents of majestic  power in the Ridvan of the Gospel, revealing those signs that must needs  herald the advent of the Manifestation after Him. In the first Gospel  according to Matthew it is recorded: And when they asked Jesus concerning  the signs of His coming, He said unto them: \"Immediately after the  oppression(19) of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall  not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers  of the earth shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of  man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they  shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and  great glory. And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a  trumpet.\"(20) Rendered into the Persian tongue,(21) the purport of these  words is as follows: When the oppression and afflictions that are to  befall mankind will have come to pass, then shall the sun be withheld from  shining, the moon from giving light, the stars of heaven shall fall upon  the earth, and the pillars of the earth shall quake. At that time, the  signs of the Son of man shall appear in heaven, that is, the promised  Beauty and Substance of life shall, when these signs have appeared, step  forth out of the realm of the invisible into the visible world. And He  saith: at that time, all the peoples and kindreds that dwell on earth  shall bewail and lament, and they shall see that divine Beauty coming from  heaven, riding upon the clouds with power, grandeur, and magnificence,  sending His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. Similarly, in the  three other Gospels, according to Luke, Mark, and John, the same  statements are recorded. As We have referred at length to these in Our  Tablets revealed in the Arabic tongue, We have made no mention of them in  these pages, and have confined Ourselves to but one reference.    Inasmuch as the Christian divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of  these words, and did not recognize their object and purpose, and have  clung to the literal interpretation of the words of Jesus, they therefore  became deprived of the streaming grace of the Muhammadan Revelation and  its showering bounties. The ignorant among the Christian community,  following the example of the leaders of their faith, were likewise  prevented from beholding the beauty of the King of glory, inasmuch as  those signs which were to accompany the dawn of the sun of the Muhammadan  Dispensation did not actually come to pass. Thus, ages have passed and  centuries rolled away, and that most pure Spirit hath repaired unto the  retreats of its ancient sovereignty. Once more hath the eternal Spirit  breathed into the mystic trumpet, and caused the dead to speed out of  their sepulchres of heedlessness and error unto the realm of guidance and  grace. And yet, that expectant community still crieth out: When shall  these things be? When shall the promised One, the object of our  expectation, be made manifest, that we may arise for the triumph of His  Cause, that we may sacrifice our substance for His sake, that we may offer  up our lives in His path? In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#3)"],[1," is there but Thee, the  All-Glorious, the Supreme Helper.            VII: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH THEE...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by this Revelation  whereby darkness hath been turned into light, through which the Frequented  Fane hath been built, and the Written Tablet revealed, and the Outspread  Roll uncovered, to send down upon me and upon them who are in my company  that which will enable us to soar into the heavens of Thy transcendent  glory, and will wash us from the stain of such doubts as have hindered the  suspicious from entering into the tabernacle of Thy unity.    I am the one, O my Lord, who hath held fast the cord of Thy  loving-kindness, and clung to the hem of Thy mercy and favors. Do Thou  ordain for me and for my loved ones the good of this world and of the  world to come. Supply them, then, with the Hidden Gift Thou didst ordain  for the choicest among Thy creatures.    These are, O my Lord, the days in which Thou hast bidden Thy servants to  observe the fast. Blessed is he that observeth the fast wholly for Thy  sake and with absolute detachment from all things except Thee. Assist me  and assist them, O my Lord, to obey Thee and to keep Thy precepts. Thou,  verily, hast power to do what Thou choosest.    There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All praise be to  God, the Lord of all worlds.            VIII: \"GLORIFIED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! THOU...\"      Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou beholdest my dwelling-place,  and the prison into which I am cast, and the woes I suffer. By Thy might!  No pen can recount them, nor can any tongue describe or number them. I  know not, O my God, for what purpose Thou hast abandoned me to Thine  adversaries. Thy glory beareth me witness! I sorrow not for the vexations  I endure for love of Thee, nor feel perturbed by the calamities that  overtake me in Thy path. My grief is rather because Thou delayest to  fulfill what Thou hast determined in the Tablets of Thy Revelation, and  ordained in the books of Thy decree and judgment.    My blood, at all times, addresseth me saying: \"O Thou Who art the Image of  the Most Merciful! How long will it be ere Thou riddest me of the  captivity of this world, and deliverest me from the bondage of this life?  Didst Thou not promise me that Thou shalt dye the earth with me, and  sprinkle me on the faces of the inmates of Thy Paradise?\" To this I make  reply: \"Be thou patient and quiet thyself. The things thou desirest can  last but an hour. As to me, however, I quaff continually in the path of  God the cup of His decree, and wish not that the ruling of His will should  cease to operate, or that the woes I suffer for the sake of my Lord, the  Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, should be ended. Seek thou my wish and  forsake thine own. Thy bondage is not for my protection, but to enable me  to sustain successive tribulations, and to prepare me for the trials that  must needs repeatedly assail me. Perish that lover who discerneth between  the pleasant and the poisonous in his love for his beloved! Be thou  satisfied with what God hath destined for thee. He, verily, ruleth over  thee as He willeth and pleaseth. No God is there but Him, the  Inaccessible, the Most High.\"            IX: \"MAGNIFIED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! I KNOW...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I know not what the water is with  which Thou hast created me, or what the fire Thou hast kindled within me,  or the clay wherewith Thou hast kneaded me. The restlessness of every sea  hath been stilled, but not the restlessness of this Ocean which moveth at  the bidding of the winds of Thy will. The flame of every fire hath been  extinguished except the Flame which the hands of Thine omnipotence have  kindled, and whose radiance Thou hast, by the power of Thy name, shed  abroad before all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth. As  the tribulations deepen, it waxeth hotter and hotter.    Behold, then, O my God, how Thy Light hath been compassed with the  onrushing winds of Thy decree, how the tempests that blow and beat upon it  from every side have added to its brightness and increased its splendor.  For all this let Thee be praised.    I implore Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, and Thy most ancient sovereignty,  to look upon Thy loved ones whose hearts have been sorely shaken by reason  of the troubles that have touched Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine  own Self. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily,  the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.            X: \"O THOU WHOSE FACE IS THE OBJECT OF THE ADORATION...\"      O Thou Whose face is the object of the adoration of all that yearn after  Thee, Whose presence is the hope of such as are wholly devoted to Thy  will, Whose nearness is the desire of all that have drawn nigh unto Thy  court, Whose countenance is the companion of those who have recognized Thy  truth, Whose name is the mover of the souls that long to behold Thy face,  Whose voice is the true life of Thy lovers, the words of Whose mouth are  as the waters of life unto all who are in heaven and on earth!    I beseech Thee, by the wrong Thou hast suffered and the ills inflicted  upon Thee by the hosts of wrongful doers, to send down upon me from the  clouds of Thy mercy that which will purify me of all that is not of Thee,  that I may be worthy to praise Thee and fit to love Thee.    Withhold not from me, O my Lord, the things Thou didst ordain for such of  Thy handmaidens as circle around Thee, and on whom are poured continually  the splendors of the sun of Thy beauty and the beams of the brightness of  Thy face. Thou art He Who from everlasting hath succored whosoever hath  sought Thee, and bountifully favored him who hath asked Thee.    No God is there beside Thee, the Mighty, the Ever-Abiding, the  All-Bounteous, the Most Generous.            XI: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! DARKNESS...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Darkness hath fallen upon every land,  and the forces of mischief have encompassed all the nations. Through them,  however, I perceive the splendors of Thy wisdom, and discern the  brightness of the light of Thy providence.    They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee have imagined that they have  the power to put out Thy light, and to quench Thy fire, and to still the  winds of Thy grace. Nay, and to this Thy might beareth me witness! Had not  every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy wisdom, and every ordeal the  vehicle of Thy providence, no one would have dared oppose us, though the  powers of earth and heaven were to be leagued against us. Were I to  unravel the wondrous mysteries of Thy wisdom which are laid bare before  me, the reins of Thine enemies would be cleft asunder.    Glorified be Thou, then, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name  to assemble them that love Thee around the Law that streameth from the  good-pleasure of Thy will, and to send down upon them what will assure  their hearts.    Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting.            XII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! THIS IS THY...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy servant who hath quaffed from  the hands of Thy grace the wine of Thy tender mercy, and tasted of the  savor of Thy love in Thy days. I beseech Thee, by the embodiments of Thy  names whom no grief can hinder from rejoicing in Thy love or from gazing  on Thy face, and whom all the hosts of the heedless are powerless to cause  to turn aside from the path of Thy pleasure, to supply him with the good  things Thou dost possess, and to raise him up to such heights that he will  regard the world even as a shadow that vanisheth swifter than the  twinkling of an eye.    Keep him safe also, O my God, by the power of Thine immeasurable majesty,  from all that Thou abhorrest. Thou art, verily, his Lord and the Lord of  all worlds.            XIII: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD! THOU BEHOLDEST...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! Thou beholdest how the tempestuous winds of  tests have caused the steadfast in faith to tremble, and how the breath of  trials hath stirred up those whose hearts had been firmly established,  except such as have partaken of the Wine that is life indeed from the  hands of the Manifestation of Thy name, the Most Merciful. These are the  ones whom no word except Thy most exalted word can move, whom nothing  whatever save the sweet smelling fragrance of the robe of Thy remembrance  can enrapture, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names and the Maker of  earth and heaven!    I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the beloved Companion of Baha, by Thy name,  the All-Glorious, to keep safe these Thy servants under the shadow of the  wings of Thine all-encompassing mercy, that the darts of the evil  suggestions of the wicked doers among Thy creatures, who have disbelieved  in Thy signs, may be kept back from them. No one on earth, O my Lord, can  withstand Thy power, and none in all the kingdom of Thy names is able to  frustrate Thy purpose. Show forth, then, the power of Thy sovereignty and  of Thy dominion, and teach Thy loved ones what beseemeth them in Thy days.    Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the  Most Great.            XIV: \"ALL PRAISE BE TO THEE, O MY GOD! THOU BEHOLDEST...\"      All praise be to Thee, O my God! Thou beholdest my helplessness and  poverty, and bearest witness unto my woes and trials. How long wilt Thou  abandon me among Thy servants? Suffer me to ascend into Thy presence. The  power of Thy might beareth me witness! Such are the tribulations with  which I am encompassed that I am powerless to recount them before Thy  face. Thou, alone, verily, hast through Thy knowledge reckoned them.    I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art my Companion in my lowliness, to rain down  upon Thy loved ones from the clouds of Thy mercy"]]]
