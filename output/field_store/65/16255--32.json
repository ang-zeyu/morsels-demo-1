In 1839, however, the colored  people raised $889.30 for this purpose, and thanks to their economic  progress, this task was not so difficult as that of raising the $150 in  1835. They were then spending considerable amounts for evening and  writing schools, attended by seventy-five persons, chiefly adults. In  1840 Reverend Mr. Denham and Mr. Goodwin had in their schools sixty-five  pupils each paying $3 per quarter, and Miss Merrill a school of  forty-seven pupils paying the same tuition. In all, the colored people  were paying these teachers about $1,300 a year. The only help the  Negroes were then receiving was that from the Ladies' Anti-Slavery  Society, which employed one Miss Seymour at a salary of $300 a year to  instruct fifty-four pupils. Moreover, the colored people were giving  liberally to objects of charity. Some Negroes burned out in 1839 were  promptly relieved by members of their own race. A white family in  distress was befriended by a colored woman. The Negroes contributed also  to the support of missionaries in Jamaica and during the years from 1836  to 1840 assisted twenty-five emancipated slaves on their way from  Cincinnati to Mercer County, Ohio.[34]    During this period they had made progress in other than material things.  Their improvement in religion and morals was remarkable. They then had  four flourishing Sabbath Schools with 310 regular attendants, one  Baptist and two Methodist churches with a membership of 800, a \"Total  Abstinence Temperance Society\" for adults numbering 450, and a \"Sabbath  School or Youth's Society\" of 180 members. A few of these violated their  pledges, but when we consider the fact that one fourth of the entire  colored population belonged to temperance organizations while less than  one tenth of the whites were thus connected, we must admit that this was  no mean achievement. Among the Negroes public sentiment was then such  that no colored man could openly sell intoxicating drinks. This growing  temperance was exhibited, too, in the decreasing fondness for dress and  finery. There was less tendency to strive merely to get a fine suit of  clothes and exhibit one's self on the streets. Places of vice were not  so much frequented and barber shops which on Sundays formerly became a  rendezvous for the idle and the garrulous were with few exceptions  closed by 1840. This influence of the religious organizations reached  also beyond the limits of Cincinnati. A theological student from the  State of New York said after spending some time in New Orleans, that the  influence of the elevation of the colored people of Cincinnati was felt  all the way down the river. Travelers often spoke of the difference in  the appearance of barbers and waiters on the boats.[35]    It was in fact a brighter day for the colored people. In 1840 an  observer said that they had improved faster than any other people in the  city. The _Cincinnati Gazette_ after characterizing certain Negroes as  being imprudent and vicious, said of others: \"Many of these are  peaceable and industrious, raising respectable families and acquiring  property.\"[36] Mr. James H. Perkins, a respectable citizen of the city,  asserted that the day school which the colored children attended had  shown by examination that it was as good as any other in the city. He  said further: \"There is no question, I presume, that the colored  population of Cincinnati, oppressed as it has been by our state laws as  well as by prejudice, has risen more rapidly than almost any other  people in any part of the world.\"[37] Within three or four years their  property had more than doubled; their schools had become firmly  established, and their churches and Sunday Schools had grown as rapidly  as any other religious institutions in the city. Trusting to good  conduct and character, they had risen to a prosperous position in the  eyes of those whose prejudices would \"allow them to look through the  skin to the soul.\"[38]    The colored people had had too many enemies in Cincinnati, however, to  expect that they had overcome all opposition. The prejudice of certain  labor groups against the Negroes increased in proportion to the  prosperity of the latter. That they had been able to do as well as they  had was due to the lack of strength on the part of the labor  organizations then forming to counteract the sentiment of fair play for  the Negroes. Their labor competed directly with that of the whites and  began again to excite \"jealousy and heart burning.\"[39] The Germans, who  were generally toiling up from poverty, seemed to exhibit less  prejudice; but the unfortunate Irish bore it grievously that even a few  Negroes should outstrip some of their race in the economic struggle.    In 1841 there followed several clashes which aggravated the situation.  In the month of June one Burnett referred to as \"a mischievous and  swaggering Englishman running a cake shop,\" had harbored a runaway  slave. When a man named McCalla, his reputed master, came with an  officer to reclaim the fugitive, Burnett and his family resisted them.  The Burnetts were committed to answer for this infraction of the law and  finally were adequately punished. The proslavery mob which had gathered  undertook to destroy their home but the officials prevented them.  Besides, early in August according to a report, a German citizen  defending his blackberry patch near the city was attacked by two Negroes  and stabbed so severely that he died. Then about three weeks thereafter,  according to another rumor, a very respectable lady was insultingly  accosted by two colored men, and when she began to flee two others  rudely thrust themselves before her on the sidewalk. But in this case,  as in most others growing out of rumors, no one could ever say who the  lady or her so-called assailants were. At the same time, too, the  situation was further aggravated by an almost sudden influx of  irresponsible Negroes from various parts, increasing the number of those  engaged in noisy frolics which had become a nuisance to certain white  neighbors.[40]    Accordingly, on Tuesday, the twenty-ninth of August, there broke out on  the corner of Sixth and Broadway a quarrel in which two or three persons  were wounded. On the following night the fracas was renewed. A group of  ruffians attacked the Dumas Hotel, a colored establishment, on  McCallister Street, demanding the surrender of a Negro, who, they  believed, was concealed there. As the Negroes of the neighborhood came  to the assistance of their friends in the hotel the mob had to withdraw.  On Thursday night there took place another clash between a group of  young men and boys and a few Negroes who seriously wounded one or two of  the former. On Friday evening the mob incited to riotous acts by an  influx of white ruffians, seemingly from the steamboats and the Kentucky  side of the river, openly assembled in Fifth Street Market without being  molested by the police, armed themselves and marched to Broadway and  Sixth Street, shouting and swearing. They attacked a colored  confectionery store near by, demolishing its doors and windows. James W.  Piatt, an influential citizen, and the mayor then addressed the  disorderly persons, vainly exhorting them to peace and obedience to the  law. Moved by passionate entreaties to execute their poorly prepared  plan, the assailants advanced and attacked the Negroes with stones. The  blacks, however, had not been idle. They had secured sufficient guns and  ammunition to fire into the mob such a volley that it had to fall back.  The aggressors rallied again, however, only to be in like manner  repulsed. Men were wounded on both sides and carried off and reported  dead. The Negroes advanced courageously, and according to a reporter,  fired down the street into the mass of ruffians, causing a hasty  retreat. This melee continued until about one o'clock when a part of the  mob secured an iron six pounder, hauled it to the place of combat  against the exhortations of the powerless mayor, and fired on the  Negroes. With this unusual advantage the blacks were forced to retreat,  many of them going to the hills. About two o'clock the mayor of the city  brought out a portion of the \"military\" which succeeded in holding the  mob at bay.[41]    On the next day the colored people in the district under fire were  surrounded by sentinels and put under martial law. Indignation meetings  of law-abiding citizens were held on Saturday to pass resolutions,  denouncing abolitionists and mobs and making an appeal to the people and  the civil authorities to uphold the law. The Negroes also held a meeting  and respectfully assured the mayor and citizens that they would use  every effort to conduct themselves orderly and expressed their readiness  to give bond according to the law of 1807 or leave the city quietly  within a specified time. But these steps availed little when the police  winked at this violence. The rioters boldly occupied the streets without  arrest and continued their work until Sunday. The mayor, sheriff and  marshal went to the battle ground about three o'clock but the mob still  had control. The officers could not even remove those Negroes who  complied with the law of leaving. The authorities finally hit upon the  scheme of decreasing the excitement by inducing about 300 colored men to  go to jail for security after they had been assured that their wives and  children would be protected. The Negroes consented and were accordingly  committed, but the cowardly element again attacked these helpless  dependents like savages. At the same time other rioters stormed the  office of _The Philanthropist_ and broke up the press. The mob continued  its work until it dispersed from mere exhaustion. The Governor finally  came to the city and issued a proclamation setting forth the gravity of  the situation. The citizens and civil authorities rallied to his support  and strong patrols"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13643"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#3)"],[1,"kind of vulgarity under the sun.    \"In spite of these things, however and of her frequent unjustifiable  Carlyleisms, (such as that of writing sentences which are no  sentences, since, to be parsed, reference must be had to sentences  preceding,) the style of Miss Fuller is one of the very best with  which I am acquainted. In general effect, I know no style which  surpasses it. It is singularly piquant, vivid, terse, bold,  luminous--leaving details out of sight, it is everything that a style  need be.    \"I believe that Miss Fuller has written much poetry, although she has  published little. That little is tainted with the affectation of the  _transcendentalists_, (I used this term, of course, in the sense which  the public of late days seem resolved to give it,) but is brimful of  the poetic _sentiment_. Here, for example, is something in Coleridge's  manner, of which the author of 'Genevieve' might have had no reason to  be ashamed:--      A maiden sat beneath a tree;    Tear-bedewed her pale cheeks be,    And she sighed heavily.      From forth the wood into the _light_    A hunter strides with carol _light_    And a glance so bold and bright.      He careless stopped and eyed the maid;    'Why weepest thou?' he gently said;    'I love thee well, be not afraid.'      He takes her hand and leads her on--    She should have waited there alone,    For he was not her chosen one.      He _leans_ her head upon his breast--    She knew 'twas not her home of rest,    But, ah! she had been sore distrest.      The sacred stars looked sadly down;    The parting moon appeared to frown,    To see thus dimmed the diamond crown.      Then from the thicket starts a deer--    The huntsman seizing _on_ his spear    Cries, 'Maiden, wait thou for me here.'      She sees him vanish into night--    She starts from sleep in deep affright,    For it was not her own true knight.      Though but in dream Gunhilda failed--    Though but a fancied ill assailed--    Though she but fancied fault bewailed--      Yet thought of day makes dream of night;    She is not worthy of the knight;    The inmost altar burns not bright.      If loneliness thou canst not bear--    Cannot the dragon's venom dare--    Of the pure meed thou shouldst despair.      Now sadder that lone maiden sighs;    Far bitterer tears profane her eyes;    Crushed in the dust her heart's flower lies.'    \"To show the evident carelessness with which this poem was  constructed, I have italicized an identical rhyme (of about the same  force in versification as an identical proposition in logic) and two  grammatical improprieties. _To lean_ is a neuter verb, and 'seizing  _on_' is not properly to be called a pleonasm, merely because it  is--nothing at all. The concluding line is difficult of pronunciation  through excess of consonants. I should have preferred, indeed, the  ante-penultimate tristich as the _finale_ of the poem.    \"The supposition that the book of an author is a thing apart from the  author's self, is, I think, ill-founded. The soul is a cipher, in the  sense of a cryptograph; and the shorter a cryptograph is, the more  difficulty there is in its comprehension--at a certain point of  brevity it would bid defiance to an army of Champollions. And thus  he who has written very little, may in that little either conceal his  spirit or convey quite an erroneous idea of it--of his acquirements,  talents, temper, manner, tenor and depth (or shallowness) of  thought--in a word of his character, of himself. But this is  impossible with him who has written much. Of such a person we get,  from his books, not merely a just, but the most just representation.  Bulwer, the individual, personal man, in a green velvet waistcoat and  amber gloves, is not by any means the veritable Sir Edward Lytton,  who is discoverable only in 'Ernest Maltravers,' where his soul is  deliberately and nakedly set forth. And who would ever know Dickens by  looking at him or talking with him, or doing anything with him except  reading his 'Curiosity Shop?' What poet, in especial, but must feel  at least the better portion of himself more fairly represented in even  his commonest sonnet, (earnestly written,) than in his most elaborate  or most intimate personalities?    \"I put all this as a general proposition, to which Miss Fuller affords  a marked exception--to this extent, that her personal character and  her printed book are merely one and the same thing. We get access  to her soul _as_ directly from the one as from the other--no _more_  readily from this than from that--easily from either. Her acts are  bookish, and her books are less thoughts than acts. Her literary and  her conversational manner are identical. Here is a passage from her  'Summer on the Lakes:'--        \"'The rapids enchanted me far beyond what I expected; they      are so swift that they cease to _seem_ so--you can think      only of their _beauty_. The fountain beyond the Moss Islands      I discovered for myself, and thought it for some time an      _accidental_ beauty which it would not do to _leave_, lest      I might never see it again. After I found it _permanent_, I      returned many times to watch the play of its crest. In the      little waterfall, beyond, Nature seems, as she often does, to      have made a _study_ for some larger design. She delights in      this--a sketch within a sketch--a dream within _a dream_.      Wherever we see it, the lines of the great buttress in the      fragment of stone, the hues of the waterfall, copied in the      flowers that _star_ its bordering mosses, we are _delighted_;      for all the lineaments become _fluent_, and we mould the scene      in congenial thought with its _genius_.'    \"Now all this is precisely as Miss Fuller would _speak_ it. She is  perpetually saying just such things in just such words. To get the  _conversational_ woman in the mind's eye, all that is needed is to  imagine her reciting the paragraph just quoted: but first let us have  the _personal_ woman. She is of the medium height; nothing remarkable  about the figure; a profusion of lustrous light hair; eyes a bluish  gray, full of fire; capacious forehead; the mouth when in repose  indicates profound sensibility, capacity for affection, for love--when  moved by a slight smile, it becomes even beautiful in the intensity  of this expression; but the upper lip, as if impelled by the action  of involuntary muscles, habitually uplifts itself, conveying the  impression of a sneer. Imagine, now, a person of this description  looking at you one moment earnestly in the face, at the next seeming  to look only within her own spirit or at the wall; moving nervously  every now and then in her chair; speaking in a high key, but  musically, deliberately, (not hurriedly or loudly,) with a delicious  distinctness of enunciation--speaking, I say, the paragraph in  question, and emphasizing the words which I have italicized, not by  impulsion of the breath, (as is usual) but by drawing them out as long  as possible, nearly closing her eyes, the while--imagine all this, and  we have both the woman and the authoress before us.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE.]    ON THE DEATH OF S.

JAMES      High hopes and bright thine early path bedecked,      And aspirations beautiful, though wild,    A heart too strong, a powerful will unchecked,      A dream that earth-things could be undefiled.      But soon, around thee, grew a golden chain,      That bound the woman to more human things,    And taught with joy--and, it may be, with pain--      That there are limits e'en to Spirits' wings.      Husband and child--the loving and beloved--      Won, from the vast of thought, a mortal part,    The empassioned wife and mother, yielding, proved      Mind has, itself, a master--in the heart.      In distant lands enhaloed by old fame      Thou found'st the only chain the spirit knew,    But, captive, led'st thy captors from the shame      Of ancient freedom, to the pride of new.      And loved hearts clung around thee on the deck,      Welling with sunny hopes 'neath sunny skies;    The wide horizon round thee had no speck;      E'en Doubt herself could see no cloud arise.      The loved ones clung around thee, when the sail,      O'er wide Atlantic billows, onward bore    Thy freight of joys, and the expanding gale      Pressed the glad bark toward thy native shore.      The loved ones clung around thee still, when all      Was darkness, tempest, terror, and dismay--    More closely clung around thee, when the pall      Of fate was falling o'er the mortal clay.      With them to live--with them, with them to die--      Sublime of human love intense and fine!    Was thy last prayer unto the Deity,      And it was granted thee by love divine.      In the same billow--in the same dark grave--      Mother, and child, and husband find their rest.    The dream is ended; and the solemn wave      Gives back the gifted to her country's breast.           *       *       *       *       *    An Illustration of the high prices paid to fortunate artists in these  times may be found in the fact that Alboni, the famous contralto  singer, has been engaged to sing at Madrid, at the enormous rate of  $400 dollars per day, while Roger, the tenor, who used to sing at the  Comic Opera at Paris, and who was transplanted to the Grand Opera to  assist in the production of Meyerbeer's \"Prophet,\" has been engaged  to sing with her at the more moderate salary of $8000 a month. This  is almost equal to the extravagant sum guaranteed to Jenny Lind for  performing in this country. It would be a curious inquiry why singers  and dancers are always paid so much more exorbitantly than painters,  sculptors or musical composers, especially as the pleasure they  confer is of a merely evanescent character, while the works of the  latter remain a perpetual source of delight and refinement to"]]]
