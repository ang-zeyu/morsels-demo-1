I found all this troublesome, and was  glad when my new Master took it from me--I was now washed, and clothed  in the Dutch or English manner.--My master grew very fond of me, and I  loved him exceedingly. I watched every look, was always ready when he  wanted me, and endeavoured to convince him, by every action, that my  only pleasure was to serve him well.--I have since thought that he must  have been a serious man. His actions corresponded very well with such a  character.--He used to read prayers in public to the ship's crew every  Sabbath day; and when first I saw him read, I was never so surprised in  my whole life as when I saw the book talk to my master; for I thought it  did, as I observed him to look upon it, and move his lips.--I wished it  would do so to me.--As soon as my master had done reading I follow'd  him to the place where he put the book, being mightily delighted with  it, and when nobody saw me, I open'd it and put my ear down close upon  it, in great hope that it wou'd say something to me; but was very sorry  and greatly disappointed when I found it would not speak, this thought  immediately presented itself to me, that every body and every thing  despis'd me because I was black.    I was exceedingly sea-sick at first; but when I became more accustom'd  to the sea, it wore off.--My master's ship was bound for Barbadoes. When  we came there, he thought fit to speak of me to several gentlemen of his  acquaintance, and one of them exprest a particular desire to see me.--He  had a great mind to buy me; but the Captain could not immediately be  prevail'd on to part with me; but however, as the gentleman seem'd very  solicitous, he at length let me go, and I was sold for fifty dollars  (_four and sixpenny-pieces in English_). My new master's name was  Vanhorn, a young Gentleman; his home was in New-England in the City of  New-York; to which place he took me with him. He dress'd me in his  livery, and was very good to me. My chief business was to wait at table,  and tea, and clean knives, and I had a very easy place; but the servants  us'd to curse and swear surprizingly; which I learnt faster than any  thing, 'twas almost the first English I could speak. If any of them  affronted me, I was sure to call upon God to damn them immediately; but  I was broke of it all at once, occasioned by the correction of an old  black servant that liv'd in the family--One day I had just clean'd the  knives for dinner, when one of the maids took one to cut bread and  butter with; I was very angry with her, and called upon God to damn her;  when this old black man told me I must not say so. I ask'd him why? He  replied there was a wicked man call'd the Devil, that liv'd in hell, and  would take all that said these words, and put them in the fire and burn  them.--This terrified me greatly, and I was entirely broke of  swearing.--Soon after this, as I was placing the china for tea, my  mistress came into the room just as the maid had been cleaning it; the  girl had unfortunately sprinkled the wainscot with the mop; at which my  mistress was angry; the girl very foolishly answer'd her again, which  made her worse, and she call'd upon God to damn her.--I was vastly  concern'd to hear this, as she was a fine young lady, and very good to  me, insomuch that I could not help speaking to her, \"Madam, says I, you  must not say so,\" Why, says she? Because there is a black man call'd the  Devil that lives in hell, and he will put you in the fire and burn you,  and I shall be very sorry for that. Who told you this replied my lady?  Old Ned, says I. Very well was all her answer; but she told my master of  it, and he order'd that old Ned should be tyed up and whipp'd, and was  never suffer'd to come into the kitchen with the rest of the servants  afterwards.--My mistress was not angry with me, but rather diverted with  my simplicity and, by way of talk, She repeated what I had said, to many  of her acquaintance that visited her; among the rest, Mr. Freelandhouse,  a very gracious, good Minister, heard it, and he took a great deal of  notice of me, and desired my master to part with me to him. He would not  hear of it at first, but, being greatly persuaded, he let me go, and Mr.  Freelandhouse gave L50. for me.--He took me home with him, and made me  kneel down, and put my two hands together, and pray'd for me, and every  night and morning he did the same.--I could not make out what it was  for, nor the meaning of it, nor what they spoke to when they talk'd--I  thought it comical, but I lik'd it very well.--After I had been a little  while with my new master I grew more familiar, and ask'd him the meaning  of prayer: (I could hardly speak english to be understood) he took great  pains with me, and made me understand that he pray'd to God, who liv'd  in Heaven; that He was my Father and best Friend.--I told him that this  must be a mistake; that _my_ father liv'd at Bournou, and I wanted very  much to see him, and likewise my dear mother, and sister, and I wish'd  he would be so good as to send me home to them; and I added, all I could  think of to induce him to convey me back. I appeared in great trouble,  and my good master was so much affected that the tears ran down his  face. He told me that God was a Great and Good Spirit, that He created  all the world, and every person and thing in it, in Ethiopia, Africa,  and America, and every where. I was delighted when I heard this: There,  says I, I always thought so when I liv'd at home! Now if I had wings  like an Eagle I would fly to tell my dear mother that God is greater  than the sun, moon, and stars; and that they were made by Him.    I was exceedingly pleas'd with this information of my master's, because  it corresponded so well with my own opinion; I thought now if I could  but get home, I should be wiser than all my country-folks, my  grandfather, or father, or mother, or any of them--But though I was  somewhat enlighten'd by this information of my master's, yet, I had no  other knowledge of God but that He was a Good Spirit, and created every  body, and every thing--I never was sensible in myself, nor had any one  ever told me, that He would punish the wicked, and love the just. I was  only glad that I had been told there was a God because I had always  thought so.    My dear kind master grew very fond of me, as was his Lady; she put me to  School, but I was uneasy at that, and did not like to go; but my master  and mistress requested me to learn in the gentlest terms, and persuaded  me to attend my school without any anger at all; that, at last, I came  to like it better, and learnt to read pretty well. My schoolmaster was a  good man, his name was Vanosdore, and very indulgent to me.--I was in  this state when, one Sunday, I heard my master preach from these words  out of the Revelations, chap. i. v. 7. _\"Behold, He cometh in the clouds  and every eye shall see him and they that pierc'd Him.\"_ These words  affected me excessively; I was in great agonies because I thought my  master directed them to me only; and, I fancied, that he observ'd me  with unusual earnestness--I was farther confirm'd in this belief as I  look'd round the church, and could see no one person beside myself in  such grief and distress as I was; I began to think that my master hated  me, and was very desirous to go home, to my own country; for I thought  that if God did come (as he said) He would be sure to be most angry with  _me_, as I did not know what He was, nor had ever heard of him before.    I went home in great trouble, but said nothing to any body.--I was  somewhat afraid of my master; I thought he disliked me.--The next text I  heard him preach from was, Heb. xii. 14. _\"follow peace with all men,  and holiness, without which no man shall see the LORD.\"_ he preached the  law so severely, that it made me tremble.--he said, that GOD would judge  the whole world; Ethiopia, Asia, and Africa, and every where.--I was  now excessively perplexed, and undetermined what to do; as I had now  reason to believe my situation would be equally bad to go, as to  stay.--I kept these thoughts to myself, and said nothing to any person  whatever.    I should have complained to my good mistress of this great trouble of  mind, but she had been a little strange to me for several days before  this happened, occasioned by a story told of me by one of the maids. The  servants were all jealous, and envied me the regard, and favour shewn me  by my master and mistress; and the Devil being always ready, and  diligent in wickedness, had influenced this girl, to make a lye on  me.--This happened about hay-harvest, and one day when I was unloading  the waggon to put the hay into the barn, she watched an opportunity, in  my absence, to take the fork out of the stick, and hide it: when I came  again to my work, and could not find it, I was a good deal vexed, but I  concluded it was dropt somewhere among the hay; so I went and bought  another with my own money: when the girl saw that I had another, she was  so malicious that she told my mistress I was very unfaithful, and not  the person she took me for; and that she knew, I had, without my  master's permission, order'd many things in his name, that he must pay  for; and as a proof of my carelessness produc'd the fork she had taken  out of the stick, and said, she had found it out of doors--My Lady, not  knowing the truth of these things, was a little shy to me, till she  mention'd it, and then I soon cleared myself, and convinc'd her that  these accusations were false.    I continued in a most unhappy state for many days. My good mistress  insisted on knowing what was the matter. When I made known my situation  she gave me John Bunyan on the holy war, to read; I found his experience  similar to my own, which gave me reason"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#3)"],[1,"abridged and altered, while  the speech and the notes upon it remained as they were. The text and the  documents that support it have throughout been accommodated to each  other.    The orthography has been in many cases altered, and an attempt made to  reduce it to some certain standard. The rule laid down for the discharge  of this task was, that, whenever Mr. Burke could be perceived to have  been uniform in his mode of spelling, that was considered as decisive;  but where he varied, (and as he was in the habit of writing by  dictation, and leaving to others the superintendence of the press, he  was peculiarly liable to variations of this sort) the best received  authorities were directed to be followed. The reader, it is trusted,  will find this object, too much disregarded in modern books, has here  been kept in view throughout. The quotations which are interspersed  through the works of Mr Burke, and which were frequently made by him  from memory, have been generally compared with the original authors.  Several mistakes in printing, of one word for another, by which the  sense was either perverted or obscured, are now rectified. Two or three  small insertions have also been made from a quarto copy corrected by Mr.  Burke himself. From the same source something more has been drawn in the  shape of notes, to which are subscribed his initials. Of this number is  the explanation of that celebrated phrase, \"the swinish multitude\": an  explanation which was uniformly given by him to his friends, in  conversation on the subject. But another note will probably interest the  reader still more, as being strongly expressive of that parental  affection which formed so amiable a feature in the character of Mr.  Burke. It is in page 203 of Vol. V., where he points out a considerable  passage as having been supplied by his \"lost son\".[7] Several other  parts, possibly amounting altogether to a page or thereabout, were  indicated in the same manner; but, as they in general consist of single  sentences, and as the meaning of the mark by which they were  distinguished was not actually expressed, it has not been thought  necessary to notice them particularly.

A    VINDICATION OF NATURAL SOCIETY:    OR,    A VIEW OF THE MISERIES AND EVILS ARISING TO MANKIND  FROM EVERY SPECIES OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETY.    IN A LETTER TO LORD ****,    BY A LATE NOBLE WRITER.    1756.          PREFACE.      Before the philosophical works of Lord Bolingbroke had appeared, great  things were expected from the leisure of a man, who, from the splendid  scene of action in which his talents had enabled him to make so  conspicuous a figure, had retired to employ those talents in the  investigation of truth. Philosophy began to congratulate herself upon  such a proselyte from the world of business, and hoped to have extended  her power under the auspices of such a leader. In the midst of these  pleasing expectations, the works themselves at last appeared in _full  body_, and with great pomp. Those who searched in them for new  discoveries in the mysteries of nature; those who expected something  which might explain or direct the operations of the mind; those who  hoped to see morality illustrated and enforced; those who looked for new  helps to society and government; those who desired to see the characters  and passions of mankind delineated; in short, all who consider such  things as philosophy, and require some of them at least in every  philosophical work, all these were certainly disappointed; they found  the landmarks of science precisely in their former places: and they  thought they received but a poor recompense for this disappointment, in  seeing every mode of religion attacked in a lively manner, and the  foundation of every virtue, and of all government, sapped with great art  and much ingenuity. What advantage do we derive from such writings? What  delight can a man find in employing a capacity which might be usefully  exerted for the noblest purposes, in a sort of sullen labor, in which,  if the author could succeed, he is obliged to own, that nothing could be  more fatal to mankind than his success?    I cannot conceive how this sort of writers propose to compass the  designs they pretend to have in view, by the instruments which they  employ. Do they pretend to exalt the mind of man, by proving him no  better than a beast? Do they think to enforce the practice of virtue, by  denying that vice and virtue are distinguished by good or ill fortune  here, or by happiness or misery hereafter? Do they imagine they shall  increase our piety, and our reliance on God, by exploding his  providence, and insisting that he is neither just nor good? Such are the  doctrines which, sometimes concealed, sometimes openly and fully avowed,  are found to prevail throughout the writings of Lord Bolingbroke; and  such are the reasonings which this noble writer and several others have  been pleased to dignify with the name of philosophy. If these are  delivered in a specious manner, and in a style above the common, they  cannot want a number of admirers of as much docility as can be wished  for in disciples. To these the editor of the following little piece has  addressed it: there is no reason to conceal the design of it any longer.    The design was to show that, without the exertion of any considerable  forces, the same engines which were employed for the destruction of  religion, might be employed with equal success for the subversion of  government; and that specious arguments might be used against those  things which they, who doubt of everything else, will never permit to be  questioned. It is an observation which I think Isocrates makes in one of  his orations against the sophists, that it is far more easy to maintain  a wrong cause, and to support paradoxical opinions to the satisfaction  of a common auditory, than to establish a doubtful truth by solid and  conclusive arguments. When men find that something can be said in favor  of what, on the very proposal, they have thought utterly indefensible,  they grow doubtful of their own reason; they are thrown into a sort of  pleasing surprise; they run along with the speaker, charmed and  captivated to find such a plentiful harvest of reasoning, where all  seemed barren and unpromising. This is the fairy land of philosophy. And  it very frequently happens, that those pleasing impressions on the  imagination subsist and produce their effect, even after the  understanding has been satisfied of their unsubstantial nature. There is  a sort of gloss upon ingenious falsehoods that dazzles the imagination,  but which neither belongs to, nor becomes the sober aspect of truth. I  have met with a quotation in Lord Coke's Reports that pleased me very  much, though I do not know from whence he has taken it: \"_Interdum  fucata falsitas_ (says he), _in multis est probabilior, at saepe  rationibus vincit nudam veritatem_.\" In such cases the writer has a  certain fire and alacrity inspired into him by a consciousness, that,  let it fare how it will with the subject, his ingenuity will be sure of  applause; and this alacrity becomes much greater if he acts upon the  offensive, by the impetuosity that always accompanies an attack, and  the unfortunate propensity which mankind have to the finding and  exaggerating faults. The editor is satisfied that a mind which has no  restraint from a sense of its own weakness, of its subordinate rank in  the creation, and of the extreme danger of letting the imagination loose  upon some subjects, may very plausibly attack everything the most  excellent and venerable; that it would not be difficult to criticise the  creation itself; and that if we were to examine the divine fabrics by  our ideas of reason and fitness, and to use the same method of attack by  which some men have assaulted revealed religion, we might with as good  color, and with the same success, make the wisdom and power of God in  his creation appear to many no better than foolishness. There is an air  of plausibility which accompanies vulgar reasonings and notions, taken  from the beaten circle of ordinary experience, that is admirably suited  to the narrow capacities of some, and to the laziness of others. But  this advantage is in a great measure lost, when a painful, comprehensive  survey of a very complicated matter, and which requires a great variety  of considerations, is to be made; when we must seek in a profound  subject, not only for arguments, but for new materials of argument,  their measures and their method of arrangement; when we must go out of  the sphere of our ordinary ideas, and when we can never walk surely, but  by being sensible of our blindness. And this we must do, or we do  nothing, whenever we examine the result of a reason which is not our  own. Even in matters which are, as it were, just within our reach, what  would become of the world, if the practice of all moral duties, and the  foundations of society, rested upon having their reasons made clear and  demonstrative to every individual?    The editor knows that the subject of this letter is not so fully handled  as obviously it might; it was not his design to say all that could  possibly be said. It had been inexcusable to fill a large volume with  the abuse of reason; nor would such an abuse have been tolerable, even  for a few pages, if some under-plot, of more consequence than the  apparent design, had not been carried on.    Some persons have thought that the advantages of the state of nature  ought to have been more fully displayed. This had undoubtedly been a  very ample subject for declamation; but they do not consider the  character of the piece. The writers against religion, whilst they oppose  every system, are wisely careful never to set up any of their own."]]]
