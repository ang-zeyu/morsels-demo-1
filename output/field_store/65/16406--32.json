[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1635"],[0,"Ion (#3)"],[1,"persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration  interpret the things of the Gods to us.    SOCRATES: And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets?    ION: There again you are right.    SOCRATES: Then you are the interpreters of interpreters?    ION: Precisely.    SOCRATES: I wish you would frankly tell me, Ion, what I am going to ask  of you: When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the  recitation of some striking passage, such as the apparition of Odysseus  leaping forth on the floor, recognized by the suitors and casting his  arrows at his feet, or the description of Achilles rushing at Hector,  or the sorrows of Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,--are you in your right  mind? Are you not carried out of yourself, and does not your soul in  an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are  speaking, whether they are in Ithaca or in Troy or whatever may be the  scene of the poem?    ION: That proof strikes home to me, Socrates. For I must frankly confess  that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears, and when I speak  of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart throbs.    SOCRATES: Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice  or festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire, and has golden  crowns upon his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears weeping  or panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly  faces, when there is no one despoiling or wronging him;--is he in his  right mind or is he not?    ION: No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, he is not  in his right mind.    SOCRATES: And are you aware that you produce similar effects on most of  the spectators?    ION: Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, and behold  the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped upon their  countenances when I am speaking: and I am obliged to give my very best  attention to them; for if I make them cry I myself shall laugh, and if I  make them laugh I myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives.    SOCRATES: Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings  which, as I am saying, receive the power of the original magnet from  one another? The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate  links, and the poet himself is the first of them. Through all these the  God sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases, and makes  one man hang down from another. Thus there is a vast chain of dancers  and masters and under-masters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from  the stone, at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And  every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is  said to be possessed, which is nearly the same thing; for he is taken  hold of. And from these first rings, which are the poets, depend others,  some deriving their inspiration from Orpheus, others from Musaeus; but  the greater number are possessed and held by Homer. Of whom, Ion, you  are one, and are possessed by Homer; and when any one repeats the words  of another poet you go to sleep, and know not what to say; but when any  one recites a strain of Homer you wake up in a moment, and your  soul leaps within you, and you have plenty to say; for not by art or  knowledge about Homer do you say what you say, but by divine inspiration  and by possession; just as the Corybantian revellers too have a quick  perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the God by whom  they are possessed, and have plenty of dances and words for that, but  take no heed of any other. And you, Ion, when the name of Homer is  mentioned have plenty to say, and have nothing to say of others. You  ask, 'Why is this?' The answer is that you praise Homer not by art but  by divine inspiration.    ION: That is good, Socrates; and yet I doubt whether you will ever have  eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer only when I am mad  and possessed; and if you could hear me speak of him I am sure you would  never think this to be the case.    SOCRATES: I should like very much to hear you, but not until you have  answered a question which I have to ask. On what part of Homer do you  speak well?--not surely about every part.    ION: There is no part, Socrates, about which I do not speak well: of  that I can assure you.    SOCRATES: Surely not about things in Homer of which you have no  knowledge?    ION: And what is there in Homer of which I have no knowledge?    SOCRATES: Why, does not Homer speak in many passages about arts? For  example, about driving; if I can only remember the lines I will repeat  them.    ION: I remember, and will repeat them.    SOCRATES: Tell me then, what Nestor says to Antilochus, his son,  where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of  Patroclus.    ION: 'Bend gently,' he says, 'in the polished chariot to the left of  them, and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice; and  slacken the rein. And when you are at the goal, let the left horse draw  near, yet so that the nave of the well-wrought wheel may not even seem  to touch the extremity; and avoid catching the stone (Il.).'    SOCRATES: Enough. Now, Ion, will the charioteer or the physician be the  better judge of the propriety of these lines?    ION: The charioteer, clearly.    SOCRATES: And will the reason be that this is his art, or will there be  any other reason?    ION: No, that will be the reason.    SOCRATES: And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge of a  certain work; for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not  know by the art of medicine?    ION: Certainly not.    SOCRATES: Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know  by the art of medicine?    ION: Certainly not.    SOCRATES: And this is true of all the arts;--that which we know with one  art we do not know with the other? But let me ask a prior question: You  admit that there are differences of arts?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: You would argue, as I should, that when one art is of one kind  of knowledge and another of another, they are different?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: Yes, surely; for if the subject of knowledge were the same,  there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different,--if  they both gave the same knowledge. For example, I know that here are  five fingers, and you know the same. And if I were to ask whether I  and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of  arithmetic, you would acknowledge that we did?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: Tell me, then, what I was intending to ask you,--whether this  holds universally? Must the same art have the same subject of knowledge,  and different arts other subjects of knowledge?    ION: That is my opinion, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no  right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art?    ION: Very true.    SOCRATES: Then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were  reciting from Homer, you or the charioteer?    ION: The charioteer.    SOCRATES: Why, yes, because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer.    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the  charioteer?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And if a different knowledge, then a knowledge of different  matters?    ION: True.    SOCRATES: You know the passage in which Hecamede, the concubine of  Nestor, is described as giving to the wounded Machaon a posset, as he  says,    'Made with Pramnian wine; and she grated cheese of goat's milk with a  grater of bronze, and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish  to drink (Il.).'    Now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of medicine  was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines?    ION: The art of medicine.    SOCRATES: And when Homer says,    'And she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet, which, set in  the horn of ox that ranges in the fields, rushes along carrying death  among the ravenous fishes (Il.),'--    will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to judge  whether these lines are rightly expressed or not?    ION: Clearly, Socrates, the art of the fisherman.    SOCRATES: Come now, suppose that you were to say to me: 'Since you,  Socrates, are able to assign different passages in Homer to their  corresponding arts, I wish that you would tell me what are the passages  of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic  art'; and you will see how readily and truly I shall answer you. For  there are many such passages, particularly in the Odyssee; as, for  example, the passage in which Theoclymenus the prophet of the house of  Melampus says to the suitors:--    'Wretched men! what is happening to you? Your heads and your faces  and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night; and the voice of  lamentation bursts forth, and your cheeks are wet with tears. And the  vestibule is full, and the court is full, of ghosts descending into the  darkness of Erebus, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil  mist is spread abroad (Od.).'    And there are many such passages in the Iliad also; as for example in  the description of the battle near the rampart, where he says:--    'As they were eager to pass the ditch, there came to them an omen: a  soaring eagle, holding back the people on the left, bore a huge bloody  dragon in his talons, still living and panting; nor had he yet resigned  the strife, for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the  breast by the neck, and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground  into the midst of the multitude. And the eagle, with a cry, was borne  afar on the wings of the wind (Il.).'    These are the sort of things which I should say that the prophet ought  to consider and determine.    ION: And you are quite right, Socrates, in saying so.    SOCRATES: Yes, Ion, and you are right also. And as I have selected from  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#3)"],[1," on perceiving him, turned towards him, and stretched out his arms. The  King of Navarre was affected; he sighed and wept, and fell on his knees  at the side of the bed. Charles embraced, and having kissed him, said,  'My brother, you lose a good master and a good friend. I know it is not  you who occasions me so much trouble; had I believed what they said, you  would not have been alive; but I have always loved you. It is to you  alone I trust my wife and daughter; earnestly do I recommend them to  your care. _Do not trust the queen_; but God protect you!'    \"The queen mother here interrupted him, 'Ah, sir, do not say  that!'--'Yes, madam, I must say it; it is the truth. Believe me, my  brother; love me; assist my wife and daughter, and implore God for mercy  on me. Adieu, my brother, adieu!' The King of Navarre remained till his  majesty expired.\"    The following minute particulars are drawn from the journal of Pierre de  L'Etoile. In the simplicity of his narration, so pleasing in the old  writers, the _nurse_ and the _monarch,_--the religious remorse of the  one, and the artless consolations of the other,--become interesting  objects.    \"King Charles, two days before his death, having called for Mazzille,  his chief physician, and complaining of the pains he suffered, asked him  if it was not possible that he, and so many other celebrated physicians  that were in his realms, could give some alleviation to his disorder;  'for I am,' said he, 'cruelly and horridly tormented.' To which Mazzille  replied, that whatever had depended on them had been tried, but that in  truth God only could be the sovereign physician in such complaints. 'I  believe,' said the king, 'that what you say is true, and that you know  nothing else. Draw from me my _custode_ (or large cap), that I may try  to rest.' Mazzille withdrew, and left orders that all should leave the  king except three, viz., La Tour, St. Pris, and his nurse, whom his  majesty greatly loved, _although she was a Huguenot_. As she had just  seated herself on a coffer, and began to doze, she heard the king groan  bitterly, weeping and sighing; she then approached the bed softly, and  drawing away his _custode_, the king said to her, giving vent to a heavy  sigh, and shedding tears plentifully, insomuch that they interrupted his  discourse--'Ah! my dear nurse! my beloved woman, what blood! what  murders! Ah! I have followed wicked advice! O my God! pardon me, and be  merciful. I know not where I am, they have made me so perplexed and  agitated. How will all this end!--What shall I do? I am lost for ever! I  know it.'--Then the nurse thus addressed him:--'Sire, be the murders on  those who forced you to order them; your majesty could not help it, and  since you never consented, and now regret them, believe God will never  impute them to you, and will cover them with the mantle of justice of  his Son, to whom alone you should look for aid. Ah! for the honour of  God, let your majesty cease from this weeping.' Having said this, she  rose for a handkerchief, for his was drenched with tears: Charles having  taken it from her, made a sign that she should retire and leave him to  repose.\"    The dreadful narrative of the massacre of St. Bartholomew is detailed in  the history of De Thou; and the same scene is painted in glowing, though  in faithful colours, by Voltaire in the Henriade.--Charles, whose last  miserable moments we come from contemplating, when he observed several  fugitive Huguenots about his palace in the morning after the massacre of  30,000 of their friends, took a fowling-piece, and repeatedly fired at  them.    Such was the effect of religion operating, perhaps not on a malignant,  but on a feeble mind!          ROYAL PROMOTIONS.      If the golden gate of preferment is not usually opened to men of real  merit, persons of no worth have entered it in a most extraordinary  manner.    Chevreau informs us that the Sultan Osman having observed a gardener  planting a cabbage with some peculiar dexterity, the manner so attracted  his imperial eye that he raised him to an office near his person, and  shortly afterwards he rewarded the planter of cabbages by creating him  _beglerbeg_ or viceroy of the Isle of Cyprus.    Marc Antony gave the house of a Roman citizen to a cook, who had  prepared for him a good supper! Many have been raised to extraordinary  preferment by capricious monarchs for the sake of a jest. Lewis XI.  promoted a poor priest whom he found sleeping in the porch of a church,  that the proverb might be verified, that to lucky men good fortune will  come even when they are asleep! Our Henry VII. made a viceroy of Ireland  if not for the sake of, at least with a clench. When the king was told  that all Ireland could not rule the Earl of Kildare, he said, then shall  this earl rule all Ireland.    It is recorded of Henry VIII. that he raised a servant to a considerable  dignity because he had taken care to have a roasted boar prepared for  him, when his majesty happened to be in the humour of feasting on one!  and the title of _Sugar-loaf-court,_ in Leadenhall-street, was probably  derived from another piece of munificence of this monarch: the widow of  a Mr. Cornwallis was rewarded by the gift of a dissolved priory there  situated, for some _fine puddings_ with which she had presented his  majesty!    When Cardinal de Monte was elected pope, before he left the conclave, he  bestowed a cardinal's hat upon a servant, whose chief merit consisted in  the daily attentions he paid to his holiness's monkey!    Louis Barbier owed all his good fortune to the familiar knowledge he had  of Rabelais. He knew his Rabelais by heart. This served to introduce him  to the Duke of Orleans, who took great pleasure in reading that author.  It was for this he gave him an abbey, and he was gradually promoted till  he became a cardinal.    George Villiers was suddenly raised from private station, and loaded  with wealth and honours by James the First, merely for his personal  beauty.[4] Almost all the favourites of James became so from their  handsomeness.[5]    M. de Chamillart, minister of France, owed his promotion merely to his  being the only man who could beat Louis XIV. at billiards. He retired  with a pension, after ruining the finances of his country.    The Duke of Luynes was originally a country lad, who insinuated himself  into the favour of Louis XIII. then young, by making bird-traps  (pies-grieches) to catch sparrows. It was little expected (says  Voltaire) that these puerile amusements were to be terminated by a most  sanguinary revolution. De Luynes, after causing his patron, the Marshal  D'Ancre, to be assassinated, and the queen-mother to be imprisoned,  raised himself to a title and the most tyrannical power.    Sir Walter Raleigh owed his promotion to an act of gallantry to Queen  Elizabeth, and Sir Christopher Hatton owed his preferment to his  dancing: Queen Elizabeth, observes Granger, with all her sagacity, could  not see the future lord chancellor in the fine dancer. The same writer  says, \"Nothing could form a more curious collection of memoirs than  _anecdotes of preferment_.\" Could the secret history of great men be  traced, it would appear that merit is rarely the first step to  advancement. It would much oftener be found to be owing to superficial  qualifications, and even vices.          NOBILITY.      Francis the First was accustomed to say, that when the nobles of his  kingdom came to court, they were received by the world as so many little  _kings_; that the day after they were only beheld as so many _princes_;  but on the third day they were merely considered as so many _gentlemen_,  and were confounded among the crowd of courtiers.--It was supposed that  this was done with a political view of humbling the proud _nobility_;  and for this reason Henry IV. frequently said aloud, in the presence of  the princes of the blood, _We are all gentlemen._    It is recorded of Philip the Third of Spain, that while he exacted the  most punctilious respect from the _grandees_, he saluted the _peasants_.  He would never be addressed but on the knees; for which he gave this  artful excuse, that as he was of low stature, every one would have  appeared too high for him. He showed himself rarely even to his  grandees, that he might the better support his haughtiness and repress  their pride. He also affected to speak to them by half words; and  reprimanded them if they did not guess the rest. In a word, he omitted  nothing that could mortify _his nobility._          MODES OF SALUTATION, AND AMICABLE CEREMONIES, OBSERVED IN VARIOUS  NATIONS.      When men, writes the philosophical compiler of \"_L'Esprit des Usages et  des Coutumes_,\" salute each other in an amicable manner, it signifies  little whether they move a particular part of the body, or practise a  particular ceremony. In these actions there must exist different  customs. Every nation imagines it employs the most reasonable ones; but  all are equally simple, and none are to be treated as ridiculous.    This infinite number of ceremonies may be reduced to two kinds; to  reverences or salutations, and to the touch of some part of the human  body. To bend and prostrate oneself to express sentiments of respect,  appears to be a natural motion; for terrified persons throw themselves  on the earth when they adore invisible beings; and the affectionate  touch of the person they salute is an expression of tenderness.    As nations decline from their ancient simplicity, much farce and grimace  are introduced. Superstition, the manners of a people, and their  situation, influence the modes of salutation; as may be observed from  the instances we collect.    Modes of salutation have sometimes very different characters, and it is  no uninteresting speculation to examine their shades. Many display a  refinement of delicacy, while others are remarkable for their  simplicity, or for their sensibility."]]]
