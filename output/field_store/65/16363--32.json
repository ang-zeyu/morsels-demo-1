[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15446"],[0,"Vocal Mastery (#3)"],[1," I do not care to sit up late at night, either, for I think late  hours react on the voice. Occasionally, if we have a few guests for  dinner, I ask them, when ten thirty arrives, to stay as long as they  wish and enjoy themselves, but I retire.      TECHNICAL STUDY    \"There are gifted people who may be called natural born singers. Melba  is one of these. Such singers do not require much technical practice, or  if they need a little of it, half an hour a day is sufficient. I am not  one of those who do not need to practice. I give between one and two  hours daily to vocalizes, scales and tone study. But I love it! A scale  is beautiful to me, if it is rightly sung. In fact it is not merely a  succession of notes; it represents color. I always translate sound into  color. It is a fascinating study to make different qualities of tonal  color in the voice. Certain roles require an entirely different range of  colors from others. One night I must sing a part with thick, heavy,  rich tones; the next night my tones must be thinned out in quite another  timbre of the voice, to fit an opposite character.\"    Asked if she can hear herself, Miss Farrar answered:    \"No, I do not actually hear my voice, except in a general way; but we  learn to know the sensations produced in muscles of throat, head, face,  lips and other parts of the anatomy, which vibrate in a certain manner  to correct tone production. We learn the _feeling_ of the tone.  Therefore every one, no matter how advanced, requires expert advice as  to the results.      WITH LEHMANN    \"I have studied for a long time with Lilli Lehmann in Berlin; in fact I  might say she is almost my only teacher, though I did have some  instruction before going to her, both in America and Paris. You see, I  always sang, even as a very little girl. My mother has excellent taste  and knowledge in music, and finding I was in danger of straining my  voice through singing with those older than myself, she placed me with a  vocal teacher when I was twelve, as a means of preservation.    \"Lehmann is a wonderful teacher and an extraordinary woman as well.  What art is there--what knowledge and understanding! What intensity  there is in everything she does. She used to say: 'Remember, these four  walls which inclose you, make a very different space to fill compared to  an opera house; you must take this fact into consideration and study  accordingly.' No one ever said a truer word. If one only studies or  sings in a room or studio, one has no idea of what it means to fill a  theater. It is a distinct branch of one's work to gain power and control  and to adapt one's self to large spaces. One can only learn this by  doing it.    \"It is sometimes remarked by listeners at the opera, that we sing too  loud, or that we scream. They surely never think of the great size of  the stage, of the distance from the proscenium arch to the footlights,  or from the arch to the first set of wings. They do not consider that  within recent years the size of the orchestra has been largely  increased, so that we are obliged to sing against this great number of  instruments, which are making every possible kind of a noise except that  of a siren. It is no wonder that we must make much effort to be heard:  sometimes the effort may seem injudicious. The point we must consider  is to make the greatest possible effect with the least possible  exertion.    \"Lehmann is the most painstaking, devoted teacher a young singer can  have. It is proof of her excellent method and her perfect understanding  of vocal mastery, that she is still able to sing in public, if not with  her old-time power, yet with good tone quality. It shows what an artist  she really is. I always went over to her every summer, until the war  came. We would work together at her villa in Gruenewald, which you  yourself know. Or we would go for a holiday down nearer Salzburg, and  would work there. We always worked wherever we were.      MEMORIZING    \"How do I memorize? I play the song or role through a number of times,  concentrating on both words and music at once. I am a pianist anyway;  and committing to memory is very easy for me. I was trained to learn by  heart from the very start. When I sang my little songs at six years old,  mother would never let me have any music before me: I must know my songs  by heart. And so I learned them quite naturally. To me singing was like  talking to people.      CONTRASTING COLORATURA AND DRAMATIC SINGING    \"You ask me to explain the difference between the coloratura and the  dramatic organ. I should say it is a difference of timbre. The  coloratura voice is bright and brilliant in its higher portion, but  becomes weaker and thinner as it descends; whereas the dramatic voice  has a thicker, richer quality all through, especially in its lower  register. The coloratura voice will sing upper C, and it will sound very  high indeed. I might sing the same tone, but it would sound like A flat,  because the tone would be of such totally different timbre.      TO THE YOUNG SINGER    \"If I have any message to the young singer, it would be: Stick to your  work and study systematically, whole-heartedly. If you do not love your  work enough to give it your best thought, to make sacrifices for it,  there is something wrong with you. Then choose some other line of work,  to which you can give undivided attention and devotion. For music  requires this. As for sacrifices, they really do not exist, if they  promote the thing you honestly love most.    \"Do not fancy you can properly prepare yourself in a short time to  undertake a musical career, for the path is a long and arduous one. You  must never stop studying, for there is always so much to learn. If I  have sung a role a hundred times, I always find places that can be  improved; indeed I never sing a role twice exactly in the same way. So,  from whatever side you consider the singer's work and career, both are  of absorbing interest.    \"Another thing; do not worry, for that is bad for your voice. If you  have not made this tone correctly, or sung that phrase to suit yourself,  pass it over for the moment with a wave of the hand or a smile; but  don't become discouraged. Go right on! I knew a beautiful American in  Paris who possessed a lovely voice. But she had a very sensitive nature,  which could not endure hard knocks. She began to worry over little  failures and disappointments, with the result that in three years her  voice was quite gone. We must not give way to disappointments, but  conquer them, and keep right along the path we have started on.      MODERN MUSIC    \"Modern music requires quite a different handling of the voice and makes  entirely different demands upon it than does the older music. The old  Italian operas required little or no action, only beautiful singing. The  opera houses were smaller and so were the orchestras. The singer could  stand still in the middle of the stage and pour out beautiful tones,  with few movements of body to mar his serenity. But we, in these days,  demand action as well as song. We need singing actors and actresses. The  music is declamatory; the singer must throw his whole soul into his  part, must act as well as sing. Things are all on a larger scale. It is  a far greater strain on the voice to interpret one of the modern Italian  operas than to sing one of those quietly beautiful works of the old  school.    \"America's growth in music has been marvelous on the appreciative and  interpretive side. With such a musical awakening, we can look forward to  the appearance of great creative genius right here in this country,  perhaps in the near future. Why should we not expect it? We have not yet  produced a composer who can write enduring operas or symphonies.  MacDowell is our highest type as yet; but others will come who will  carry the standard higher.      VOICE LIMITATIONS    \"The singer must be willing to admit limitations of voice and style and  not attempt parts which do not come within the compass of her  attainments. Neither is it wise to force the voice up or down when it  seems a great effort to do so. We can all think of singers whose natural  quality is mezzo--let us say--who try to force the voice up into a  higher register. There is one artist of great dramatic gifts, who not  content with the rich quality of her natural organ, tried to add several  high notes to the upper portion. The result was disastrous. Again, some  of our young singers who possess beautiful, sweet voices, should not  force them to the utmost limit of power, simply to fill, or try to fill  a great space. The life of the voice will be impaired by such injurious  practice.      VOCAL MASTERY    \"What do I understand by vocal mastery? It is something very difficult  to define. For a thing that is mastered must be really perfect. To  master vocal art, the singer must have so developed his voice that it is  under complete control; then he can do with it whatsoever he wishes. He  must be able to produce all he desires of power, pianissimo, accent,  shading, delicacy and variety of color. Who is equal to the task?\"    Miss Farrar was silent a moment; then she said, answering her own  question:    \"I can think of but two people who honestly can be said to possess vocal  mastery: they are Caruso and McCormack. Those who have only heard the  latter do little Irish tunes, have no idea of what he is capable. I have  heard him sing Mozart as no one else I know of can. These two artists  have, through ceaseless application, won vocal mastery. It is something  we are all striving for!\"          III    =VICTOR MAUREL=    MIND IS EVERYTHING      Mr. James Huneker, in one of his series of articles entitled \"With the  Immortals,\" in the New York _World_, thus, in his inimitable way  characterizes Victor Maurel:    \"I don't suppose there is to be found in musical annals such diversity  of aptitudes as that displayed by this French baritone. Is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15460"],[0,"A Course In Wood Turning (#3)"],[1,"where the sharpening begins.    The sharpening of a gouge for turning is rather difficult for the  average student. The ordinary gouge which has a square nose may be  beveled by merely turning it half way around and back again. In working  out the round nose of a gouge for wood turning, it is necessary that the  handle be swung from one side to the other while, at the same time, the  chisel is revolved to cut the bevel evenly. It is sometimes necessary to  allow some pupils to use the side of the emery wheel in sharpening the  gouge. This kind of grinding, however, does not leave the tool hollow  ground as when the face of the wheel is used.    To complete the sharpening the rough edge is worked smooth on a slip  stone, the cross section of which is wedge-shaped and the edges of which  are rounded. The toe and heel of the beveled side of the gouge are  brought into contact with the flat side of the stone. As the sharpening  proceeds the wire edge is worked to the inside of the gouge. The rounded  edge of the stone is then placed inside the gouge and is worked back and  forth until the rough edge disappears. Great care must be taken not to  bevel the inside of the gouge when whetting with the round edges of the  stone, as the result will be the same as with an ordinary chisel or  plane bit.      Parting Tool    The parting tool is sharpened on both sides. This tool differs from the  ordinary chisel in that it is between 5/8\" and 3/4\" thick and only about  1/8\" wide at the widest point, which is in the center of its entire  length. The bevels must meet exactly at the center, or the widest  point, and should make an angle of about 50 deg. with each other. If the  bevels do not meet at the widest point the tool will not clear, and the  sides will rub against the revolving stock; the tool will be burned and  will thus lose its temper. The bevel should be hollow ground slightly as  then comparatively little metal need be removed when whetting.      Scraping Tools    The round nose, square nose, spear point, right skew and left skew are  scraping tools, used chiefly in pattern work and sometimes in face-plate  work. They are sharpened on one side only, and the bevel is about twice  the thickness of the chisel at the point where sharpened. These tools  should be slightly hollow ground to facilitate the whetting. Scraping  tools become dull quite easily as their edges are in contact with the  wood almost at right angles. After sharpening, the edges of these tools  may be turned with a burnisher or the broad side of a skew chisel in the  same manner that the edge of a cabinet scraper is turned though not  nearly to so great a degree. This will help to keep the tool sharp for,  as the edge wears off, the tool sharpens itself to a certain extent. The  chisel is of harder material than a cabinet scraper so that it will not  stand a great amount of turning over on the edge. Small pieces will be  broken out, unless a flat surface is rubbed against the edge at a more  acute angle than was used in the whetting. If a narrow burnisher is  used, pieces are more likely to be broken out from the sharp edge and  thus make the tool useless.          CHAPTER IV    SPINDLE TURNING      Spindle turning is the term applied to all work done on a lathe in which  the stock to be worked upon is held firmly between the live and dead  centers. There are two methods in common use in wood turning: first, the  scraping or pattern-makers' method; and second, the cutting method. Each  has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is necessary that both be  learned in order to develop a well rounded turner. Care should be  exercised, however, that each method be used in its proper place. The  first is slower, harder on the cutting edge of tools, and less skill is  required to obtain accurate work; the second is faster, easier on the  cutting edge of tools, and the accuracy of results obtained depends upon  the skill acquired. As skill is the one thing most sought for in high  school work, the use of the cutting method is advocated entirely for all  spindle turning and, with but few exceptions, for face-plate and chuck  turning.      TO CENTER STOCK    If the wood to be turned is square or rectangular in shape the best way  to locate the center is to draw diagonals across the end of the stock.  The point of intersection locates the center.      CLAMPING STOCK IN THE LATHE    Take the live center from the spindle and with a wooden mallet drive the  spur deep into the wood. Never drive the wood onto the live center while  in the spindle because serious injury may be done the machine by such  practice. When extremely hard wood is being used, it is a good practice  to make saw cuts along the diagonal lines and bore a hole at the  intersection, thus allowing the spur to enter the wood more freely. Oil  the other end of the wood while holding it in a vertical position, and  give the oil a chance to penetrate into the wood. Then replace the live  center by taking the stock and center and forcing it into the spindle by  a sudden push of the hand. The tail stock is then moved about 1/2\" to 1\"  from the end of the piece to be turned, having the tail spindle well  back in the tail stock. The tail stock is then clamped to the lathe bed.  Turn the tail stock hand wheel until the wood is held firmly. Work the  cone pulley by hand at the same time, so that the cup or dead center  will be forced deeply into the wood, so deeply that the live center will  not continue to turn. Now turn the dead spindle back until the live  spindle begins to turn freely and clamp the dead spindle fast.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]      ADJUSTING THE TOOL REST    Horizontally the tool rest should be set about 1/8\" from the farthest  projecting corner of the wood and should be readjusted occasionally as  the stock diminishes in size. The vertical height varies slightly  according to the height of the operator. It is even with the center of  the spindle for a short person; 1/8\" above for a medium person; and 1/4\"  above for a tall person. So long as the stock is in its square form the  tool rest should never be adjusted while the machine is in motion as  there is danger of the rest catching the corners and throwing the stock  from the machine. Also see that everything is clamped tight before  starting the lathe.      POSITION OF THE OPERATOR    The operator stands firmly on the floor back far enough from the lathe  to allow him to pass the tools from right to left in front of his body  without changing the position of the feet. It may be found convenient  to turn slightly, bringing the left side of the body a little closer to  the lathe. In no case, however, should the tools be brought in contact  with the body as the cutting operation from right to left should be  accomplished by a movement of the arms alone and not the swaying of the  body. (Fig. 3.)      HOLDING THE TOOLS    All tools should be held firmly but not rigidly. The right hand should  grasp the handle at the extreme end for two reasons: first, to give as  much leverage as possible so that the tool will not be thrown from the  hands in case it should catch in the wood; second, a slight wavering of  the hand will not cause as much variance in the cuts as when held closer  up to the rest. The left hand should act as a guide and should be held  over the tool near the cutting edge. The little finger and the back part  of the palm of the hand should touch the tool rest thus assuring a  steady movement. The left hand should not grasp the tool at any time.  (Fig. 3.)      USE OF THE TOOLS IN SPINDLE TURNING    The correct use of the various tools used in spindle turning will be  explained in detail as the steps are worked out in the sequence of  operations on the exercises in Section A-I.          CHAPTER V    TOOL PROCESSES IN SPINDLE TURNING      Exercise A-I--1-a. Straight Cuts    1. THE ROUGHING CUT (LARGE GOUGE).    FIG. 4. Place the gouge on the rest so that the level is above the wood  and the cutting edge is tangent to the circle or surface of the  cylinder. The handle should be held well down.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    Roll the gouge over slightly to the right so that it will make a  shearing cut instead of a scraping cut. This rolling of the tool will  also throw the chips from the operator.      Then lift the handle slowly, forcing the cutting edge deep enough into  the wood to remove all or nearly all of the corners, at the end of the  work which is being turned. This cut is begun about 3/4\" from the dead  center end. Work back another 3/4\", moving toward the live center and  make a second cut, and so on until the entire length of the cylinder is  gone over. This method of removing corners should always be followed to  avoid any possibility of breaking a large sliver from the stock, with  consequent danger to the worker.    The tool may then be worked from one end to the other, getting a  fairly-smooth, regular surface, slightly above the diameter required.  However, do not begin on the very edge of the cylinder end. It is better  to begin about 2\" from one end and work to the other, and then reverse  and work back.    The tool should also be held at a slight angle to the axis of the  cylinder, with the cutting point always in advance of the handle.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]      2. THE SIZING CUT (SMALL GOUGE). FIG. 5.    Set the calipers to the required diameter of the cylinder.    With a small gouge held in the right hand scrape grooves about 1\" apart,  holding the calipers in the left hand perpendicular to the cylinder and  measuring the cuts as they are made. The scraping should continue until  the calipers will pass easily over the cylinder. It will be well while  scraping to work the handle of the gouge a little from side to side so  that the nose has more clearance. This will prevent the piece which is  being turned from chattering or vibrating.    The calipers will be slightly sprung by coming in"]]]
