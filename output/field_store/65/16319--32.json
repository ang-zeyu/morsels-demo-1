His executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes,  but in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his  plans, in the undismayed firmness with which he adhered to them in the  face of popular clamour, of conflicting counsels from his advisers,  sometimes, even, of what others deemed all but hopeless failure. These  were the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the Republic through  the heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it. But the mainspring of  his power, and the truest evidence of his greatness, lay in the nobility  of his aims, in the fervour of his conviction, in the stainless  rectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the  people. Without these things neither the vigour of his intellect nor the  firmness of his will would have availed.    There is a vulgar saying that all great men are unscrupulous. Of him it  may rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking  and his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and  purity of his character. Lincoln's is one of the careers that refute  this imputation on human nature.

Many old houses have disappeared on account of the loyalty of their  owners, who were unfortunate enough to reside within the regions  harassed by the Civil War. This was especially the case in the county  of Oxford. Still you may see avenues of venerable trees that lead to  no house. The old mansion or manor-house has vanished. Many of them  were put in a posture of defence. Earthworks and moats, if they did  not exist before, were hastily constructed, and some of these houses  were bravely defended by a competent and brave garrison, and were  thorns in the sides of the Parliamentary army. Upon the triumph of the  latter, revenge suffered not these nests of Malignants to live. Others  were so battered and ruinous that they were only fit residences for  owls and bats. Some loyal owners destroyed the remains of their homes  lest they should afford shelter to the Parliamentary forces. David  Walter set fire to his house at Godstow lest it should afford  accommodation to the \"Rebels.\" For the same reason Governor Legge  burnt the new episcopal palace, which Bancroft had only finished ten  years before at Cuddesdon. At the same time Thomas Gardiner burnt his  manor-house in Cuddesdon village, and many other houses were so  battered that they were left untenanted, and so fell to ruin.[1] Sir  Bulstrode Whitelock describes how he slighted the works at Phillis  Court, \"causing the bulwarks and lines to be digged down, the grafts  [i.e. moats] filled, the drawbridge to be pulled up, and all levelled.  I sent away the great guns, the granadoes, fireworks, and ammunition,  whereof there was good store in the fort. I procured pay for my  soldiers, and many of them undertook the service in Ireland.\" This is  doubtless typical of what went on in many other houses. The famous  royal manor-house of Woodstock was left battered and deserted, and  \"haunted,\" as the readers of _Woodstock_ will remember, by an \"adroit  and humorous royalist named Joe Collins,\" who frightened the  commissioners away by his ghostly pranks. In 1651 the old house was  gutted and almost destroyed. The war wrought havoc with the old  houses, as it did with the lives and other possessions of the  conquered.      [1] _History of Oxfordshire_, by J. Meade Falkner.    [Illustration: Seventeenth-century Trophy]    But we are concerned with times less remote, with the vanishing of  historic monuments, of noble specimens of architecture, and of the  humble dwellings of the poor, the picturesque cottages by the wayside,  which form such attractive features of the English landscape. We have  only to look at the west end of St. Albans Abbey Church, which has  been \"Grimthorped\" out of all recognition, or at the over-restored  Lincoln's Inn Chapel, to see what evil can be done in the name of  \"Restoration,\" how money can be lavishly spent to a thoroughly bad  purpose.    Property in private hands has suffered no less than many of our  public buildings, even when the owner is a lover of antiquity and does  not wish to remove and to destroy the objects of interest on his  estate. Estate agents are responsible for much destruction. Sir John  Stirling Maxwell, Bart., F.S.A., a keen archaeologist, tells how an  agent on his estate transformed a fine old grim sixteenth-century  fortified dwelling, a very perfect specimen of its class, into a house  for himself, entirely altering the character of its appearance, adding  a lofty oriel and spacious windows with a new door and staircase,  while some of the old stones were made to adorn a rockery in the  garden. When he was abroad the elaborately contrived entrance for the  defence of a square fifteenth-century keep with four square towers at  the corners, very curious and complete, were entirely obliterated by a  zealous mason. In my own parish I awoke one day to find the old  village pound entirely removed by order of an estate agent, and a very  interesting stand near the village smithy for fastening oxen when they  were shod disappeared one day, the village publican wanting the posts  for his pig-sty. County councils sweep away old bridges because they  are inconveniently narrow and steep for the tourists' motors, and  deans and chapters are not always to be relied upon in regard to their  theories of restoration, and squire and parson work sad havoc on the  fabrics of old churches when they are doing their best to repair them.  Too often they have decided to entirely demolish the old building, the  most characteristic feature of the English landscape, with its square  grey tower or shapely spire, a tower that is, perhaps, loopholed and  battlemented, and tells of turbulent times when it afforded a secure  asylum and stronghold when hostile bands were roving the countryside.  Within, piscina, ambrey, and rood-loft tell of the ritual of former  days. Some monuments of knights and dames proclaim the achievements of  some great local family. But all this weighs for nothing in the eyes  of the renovating squire and parson. They must have a grand, new,  modern church with much architectural pretension and fine decorations  which can never have the charm which attaches to the old building. It  has no memories, this new structure. It has nothing to connect it with  the historic past. Besides, they decree that it must not cost too  much. The scheme of decoration is stereotyped, the construction  mechanical. There is an entire absence of true feeling and of any real  inspiration of devotional art. The design is conventional, the pattern  uniform. The work is often scamped and hurried, very different from  the old method of building. We note the contrast. The medieval  builders were never in a hurry to finish their work. The old fanes  took centuries to build; each generation doing its share, chancel or  nave, aisle or window, each trying to make the church as perfect as  the art of man could achieve. We shall see how much of this sound and  laborious work has vanished, a prey to restoration and ignorant  renovation. We shall see the house-breaker at work in rural hamlet and  in country town. Vanishing London we shall leave severely alone. Its  story has been already told in a large and comely volume by my friend  Mr. Philip Norman. Besides, is there anything that has not vanished,  having been doomed to destruction by the march of progress, now that  Crosby Hall has gone the way of life in the Great City? A few old  halls of the City companies remain, but most of them have given way to  modern palaces; a few City churches, very few, that escaped the Great  Fire, and every now and again we hear threatenings against the  masterpieces of Wren, and another City church has followed in the wake  of all the other London buildings on which the destroyer has laid his  hand. The site is so valuable; the modern world of business presses  out the life of these fine old edifices. They have to make way for  new-fangled erections built in the modern French style with sprawling  gigantic figures with bare limbs hanging on the porticoes which seem  to wonder how they ever got there, and however they were to keep  themselves from falling. London is hopeless! We can but delve its soil  when opportunities occur in order to find traces of Roman or medieval  life. Churches, inns, halls, mansions, palaces, exchanges have  vanished, or are quickly vanishing, and we cast off the dust of London  streets from our feet and seek more hopeful places.    [Illustration: Old Shop, formerly standing in Cliffe High Street,  Lewes]    But even in the sleepy hollows of old England the pulse beats faster  than of yore, and we shall only just be in time to rescue from  oblivion and the house-breaker some of our heritage. Old city walls  that have defied the attacks of time and of Cromwell's Ironsides are  often in danger from the wiseacres who preside on borough  corporations. Town halls picturesque and beautiful in their old age  have to make way for the creations of the local architect. Old shops  have to be pulled down in order to provide a site for a universal  emporium or a motor garage. Nor are buildings the only things that are  passing away. The extensive use of motor-cars and highway vandalism  are destroying the peculiar beauty of the English roadside. The  swift-speeding cars create clouds of white dust which settles upon the  hedges and trees, covering them with it and obscuring the wayside  flowers and hiding all their attractiveness. Corn and grass are  injured and destroyed by the dust clouds. The charm and poetry of the  country walk are destroyed by motoring demons, and the wayside  cottage-gardens, once the most attractive feature of the English  landscape, are ruined. The elder England, too, is vanishing in the  modes, habits, and manners of her people. Never was the truth of the  old oft-quoted Latin proverb--_Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in  illis_--so pathetically emphatic as it is to-day. The people are  changing in their habits and modes of thought. They no longer take  pleasure in the simple joys of their forefathers. Hence in our  chronicle of Vanishing England we shall have to refer to some of those  strange customs which date back to primeval ages, but which the  railways, excursion trains, and the schoolmaster in a few years will  render obsolete.    In recording the England that is vanishing the artist's pencil will  play a more prominent part than the writer's pen. The graphic sketches  that illustrate this book are far more valuable and helpful to the  discernment of the things that remain than the most effective  descriptions. We have tried together to gather up the fragments that  remain that nothing be lost; and though there may be much that we have  not gathered, the examples herein given of some of the treasures that  are left may be useful in creating a greater reverence for the work  bequeathed to us by our forefathers, and in strengthening the hands of  those who would preserve them.
