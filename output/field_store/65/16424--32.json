Rawlinson's translation of the famous inscription was an important  contribution towards the decipherment of the cuneiform writings of  Assyria and Babylonia.    Twelve years of brilliant Mesopotamian discovery concluded in 1854,  and further excavations had to be suspended until the \"seventies\" on  account of the unsettled political conditions of the ancient land and  the difficulties experienced in dealing with Turkish officials. During  the interval, however, archaeologists and philologists were kept fully  engaged studying the large amount of material which had been  accumulated. Sir Henry Rawlinson began the issue of his monumental  work _The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia_ on behalf of the  British Museum.    Goodspeed refers to the early archaeological work as the \"Heroic  Period\" of research, and says that the \"Modern Scientific Period\"  began with Mr. George Smith's expedition to Nineveh in 1873.    George Smith, like Henry Schliemann, the pioneer investigator of  pre-Hellenic culture, was a self-educated man of humble origin. He was  born at Chelsea in 1840. At fourteen he was apprenticed to an  engraver. He was a youth of studious habits and great originality, and  interested himself intensely in the discoveries which had been made by  Layard and other explorers. At the British Museum, which he visited  regularly to pore over the Assyrian inscriptions, he attracted the  attention of Sir Henry Rawlinson. So greatly impressed was Sir Henry  by the young man's enthusiasm and remarkable intelligence that he  allowed him the use of his private room and provided casts and  squeezes of inscriptions to assist him in his studies. Smith made  rapid progress. His earliest discovery was the date of the payment of  tribute by Jehu, King of Israel, to the Assyrian Emperor Shalmaneser.  Sir Henry availed himself of the young investigator's assistance in  producing the third volume of _The Cuneiform Inscriptions_.    In 1867 Smith received an appointment in the Assyriology Department of  the British Museum, and a few years later became famous throughout  Christendom as the translator of fragments of the Babylonian Deluge  Legend from tablets sent to London by Rassam. Sir Edwin Arnold, the  poet and Orientalist, was at the time editor of the _Daily Telegraph_,  and performed a memorable service to modern scholarship by dispatching  Smith, on behalf of his paper, to Nineveh to search for other  fragments of the Ancient Babylonian epic. Rassam had obtained the  tablets from the great library of the cultured Emperor Ashur-bani-pal,  \"the great and noble Asnapper\" of the Bible,[5] who took delight, as  he himself recorded, in        The wisdom of Ea,[6] the art of song, the treasures of science.    This royal patron of learning included in his library collection,  copies and translations of tablets from Babylonia. Some of these were  then over 2000 years old. The Babylonian literary relics were, indeed,  of as great antiquity to Ashur-bani-pal as that monarch's relics are  to us.    The Emperor invoked Nebo, god of wisdom and learning, to bless his  \"books\", praying:        Forever, O Nebo, King of all heaven and earth,      Look gladly upon this Library      Of Ashur-bani-pal, his (thy) shepherd, reverencer of thy          divinity.[7]    Mr. George Smith's expedition to Nineveh in 1873 was exceedingly  fruitful of results. More tablets were discovered and translated. In  the following year he returned to the ancient Assyrian city on behalf  of the British Museum, and added further by his scholarly achievements  to his own reputation and the world's knowledge of antiquity. His last  expedition was made early in 1876; on his homeward journey he was  stricken down with fever, and on 19th August he died at Aleppo in his  thirty-sixth year. So was a brilliant career brought to an untimely  end.    Rassam was engaged to continue Smith's great work, and between 1877  and 1882 made many notable discoveries in Assyria and Babylonia,  including the bronze doors of a Shalmaneser temple, the sun temple at  Sippar; the palace of the Biblical Nebuchadrezzar, which was famous  for its \"hanging gardens\"; a cylinder of Nabonidus, King of Babylon;  and about fifty thousand tablets.    M. de Sarzec, the French consul at Bassorah, began in 1877 excavations  at the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash (Shirpula), and continued them  until 1900. He found thousands of tablets, many has reliefs, votive  statuettes, which worshippers apparently pinned on sacred shrines, the  famous silver vase of King Entemena, statues of King Gudea, and  various other treasures which are now in the Louvre.    The pioneer work achieved by British and French excavators stimulated  interest all over the world. An expedition was sent out from the  United States by the University of Pennsylvania, and began to operate  at Nippur in 1888. The Germans, who have displayed great activity in  the domain of philological research, are at present represented by an  exploring party which is conducting the systematic exploration of the  ruins of Babylon. Even the Turkish Government has encouraged research  work, and its excavators have accumulated a fine collection of  antiquities at Constantinople. Among the archaeologists and linguists  of various nationalities who are devoting themselves to the study of  ancient Assyrian and Babylonian records and literature, and gradually  unfolding the story of ancient Eastern civilization, those of our own  country occupy a prominent position. One of the most interesting  discoveries of recent years has been new fragments of the Creation  Legend by L.W. King of the British Museum, whose scholarly work, _The  Seven Tablets of Creation_, is the standard work on the subject.    The archaeological work conducted in Persia, Asia Minor, Palestine,  Cyprus, Crete, the Aegean, and Egypt has thrown, and is throwing, much  light on the relations between the various civilizations of antiquity.  In addition to the Hittite discoveries, with which the name of  Professor Sayce will ever be associated as a pioneer, we now hear much  of the hitherto unknown civilizations of Mitanni and Urartu (ancient  Armenia), which contributed to the shaping of ancient history. The  Biblical narratives of the rise and decline of the Hebrew kingdoms  have also been greatly elucidated.    In this volume, which deals mainly with the intellectual life of the  Mesopotamian peoples, a historical narrative has been provided as an  appropriate setting for the myths and legends. In this connection the  reader must be reminded that the chronology of the early period is  still uncertain. The approximate dates which are given, however, are  those now generally adopted by most European and American authorities.  Early Babylonian history of the Sumerian period begins some time prior  to 3000 B.C; Sargon of Akkad flourished about 2650 B.C., and Hammurabi  not long before or after 2000 B.C. The inflated system of dating which  places Mena of Egypt as far back as 5500 B.C. and Sargon at about 3800  B.C. has been abandoned by the majority of prominent archaeologists,  the exceptions including Professor Flinders Petrie. Recent discoveries  appear to support the new chronological system. \"There is a growing  conviction\", writes Mr. Hawes, \"that Cretan evidence, especially in  the eastern part of the island, favours the minimum (Berlin) system of  Egyptian chronology, according to which the Sixth (Egyptian) Dynasty  began at _c_. 2540 B.C. and the Twelfth at _c_. 2000 B.C.[8] Petrie  dates the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty at _c_. 3400 B.C.    To students of comparative folklore and mythology the myths and  legends of Babylonia present many features of engrossing interest.  They are of great antiquity, yet not a few seem curiously familiar. We  must not conclude, however, that because a European legend may bear  resemblances to one translated from a cuneiform tablet it is  necessarily of Babylonian origin. Certain beliefs, and the myths which  were based upon them, are older than even the civilization of the  Tigro-Euphrates valley. They belong, it would appear, to a stock of  common inheritance from an uncertain cultural centre of immense  antiquity. The problem involved has been referred to by Professor  Frazer in the _Golden Bough_. Commenting on the similarities presented  by certain ancient festivals in various countries, he suggests that  they may be due to \"a remarkable homogeneity of civilization  throughout Southern Europe and Western Asia in prehistoric times. How  far\", he adds, \"such homogeneity of civilization may be taken as  evidence of homogeneity of race is a question for the ethnologist.\"[9]    In Chapter I the reader is introduced to the ethnological problem, and  it is shown that the results of modern research tend to establish a  remote racial connection between the Sumerians of Babylonia, the  prehistoric Egyptians, and the Neolithic (Late Stone Age) inhabitants  of Europe, as well as the southern Persians and the \"Aryans\" of India.    Comparative notes are provided in dealing with the customs, religious  beliefs, and myths and legends of the Mesopotamian peoples to assist  the student towards the elucidation and partial restoration of certain  literary fragments from the cuneiform tablets. Of special interest in  this connection are the resemblances between some of the Indian and  Babylonian myths. The writer has drawn upon that \"great storehouse\" of  ancient legends, the voluminous Indian epic, the _Mahabharata_, and it  is shown that there are undoubted links between the Garuda eagle myths  and those of the Sumerian Zu bird and the Etana eagle, while similar  stories remain attached to the memories of \"Sargon of Akkad\" and the  Indian hero Karna, and of Semiramis (who was Queen Sammu-rama"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#3)"],[1,"to a useless and senseless mechanical \"practising.\" I may perhaps teach  the treble notes after the first six months or after sixty or eighty  lessons, but I teach them in my own peculiar way, so that the pupil's  mind may be kept constantly active. With my own daughters I did not  teach the treble notes till the end of the first year's instruction, the  bass notes several months later.    FRIEND. But what did you do meanwhile?    DOMINIE. You really ought to be able to answer that question for  yourself after hearing this lesson, and what I have said about it. I  have cultivated a musical taste in my pupils, and almost taught them to  be skilful, good players, without knowing a note. I have taught a  correct, light touch of the keys from the fingers, and of whole chords  from the wrist; to this I have added the scales in all the keys; but  these should not be taught at first, with both hands together. The pupil  may gradually acquire the habit of practising them together later; but  it is not desirable to insist on this too early, for in playing the  scales with both hands together the weakness of the fourth finger is  concealed, and the attention distracted from the feeble tones, and the  result is an unequal and poor scale.    At the same time, I have in every way cultivated the sense of time, and  taught the division of the bars. I have helped the pupils to invent  little cadences with the dominant and sub-dominant and even little  exercises, to their great delight and advantage; and I have, of course,  at the same time insisted on the use of the correct fingering. You see  that, in order to become practical, I begin with the theory. So, for  instance, I teach the pupil to find the triad and the dominant chord of  the seventh, with their transpositions in every key, and to practise  them diligently; and to make use of these chords in all sorts of new  figures and passages. But all this must be done without haste, and  without tiring the pupil too much with one thing, or wearing out the  interest, which is all-important.    After that, I teach them to play fifty or sixty little pieces, which I  have written for this purpose. They are short, rhythmically balanced,  agreeable, and striking to the ear, and aim to develop gradually an  increased mechanical skill. I require them to be learned by heart, and  often to be transposed into other keys; in which way the memory, which  is indispensable for piano playing, is unconsciously greatly increased.  They must be learned _perfectly_ and played well, often, according to  the capacity of the pupil, even finely; in strict time (counting aloud  is seldom necessary) and without stumbling or hesitating; first slowly,  then fast, faster, slow again, _staccato_, _legato_, _piano_, _forte_,  _crescendo_, _diminuendo_, &c. This mode of instruction I find always  successful; but I do not put the cart before the horse, and, without  previous technical instruction, begin my piano lessons with the  extremely difficult acquirement of the treble and bass notes. In a word,  I have striven, as a psychologist and thinker, as a man and teacher, for  a many-sided culture. I have also paid great attention to the art of  singing, as a necessary foundation for piano-playing. I have devoted  some talent, and at least an enthusiastic, unwearied love to the  subject. I have never stood still; have learned something of teaching  every day, and have sought always to improve myself; I have always been  something new and different, in every lesson and with every child; I  have always kept up a cheerful, joyous courage, and this has usually  kindled the same in my pupil, because it came from the heart. Moreover,  I have never been a man of routine, have never shown myself a pedant,  who is obliged to hold fast to certain ideas and views.    I have lived up to the century, and have tried to understand and to  advance the age; have heard every thing great and fine in music, and  have induced my pupils also to hear it. I have opposed with  determination all the prejudices and false tendencies of the times, and  never have allowed impatient parents to give advice about my lessons. I  have insisted upon a good and well-tuned instrument for my pupils, and  have endeavored to merit the love and confidence both of my pupils and  of their parents. In fact, I have devoted myself thoroughly to my  calling, and have been wholly a teacher, always fixing my eye on the  true, the beautiful, and the artistic; and in this way have been of  service to my pupils.    FRIEND. But how do you find parents who sympathize with your ideas and  with your lofty views?    DOMINIE. I have found that almost all the parents of my pupils have  entered into my views, if not immediately, at least after they had been  present at a few lessons. In the case of those few who would not enter  into them, I have abandoned the lessons; but, nevertheless, I have found  that my time has been fully occupied. My friend, do you not think that  views like these will assist in the training of young and inexperienced  teachers, who are striving for improvement? and do you not think they  will be useful even to those who already possess general mental culture,  and who are animated by an ardent love for their calling? I especially  avoid giving here any exclusive method, a servile following of which  would be entirely contrary to my intentions, and, in fact, contrary to  my method.    But as for the rest! Alas, all those who do not understand me, or who  choose to misunderstand me, those are the worst!--especially the  ill-natured people, the _classical_ people who bray about music, stride  straight to the notes, and have no patience till they come to Beethoven;  who foolishly prate and fume about my unclassical management, but at  bottom only wish to conceal their own unskilfulness, their want of  culture and of disinterestedness, or to excuse their habitual drudgery.  Lazy people without talent I cannot undertake to inspirit, to teach,  and to cultivate.    This chapter will, almost by itself, point out to unprejudiced minds my  method of giving more advanced instruction, and will show in what spirit  I have educated my own daughters, even to the highest point of musical  culture, without using the slightest severity. It will, indeed, cause  great vexation to the ill-minded and even to the polite world, who  attribute the musical position of my daughters in the artistic world to  a tyranny used by me, to immoderate and unheard-of \"practising,\" and to  tortures of every kind; and who do not hesitate to invent and  industriously to circulate the most absurd reports about it, instead of  inquiring into what I have already published about teaching, and  comparing it with the management which, with their own children, has led  only to senseless thrumming.          CHAPTER II.    AN EVENING ENTERTAINMENT AT HERR ZACH'S.      DRAMATIS PERSONAE.    HERR ZACH, _formerly a flute-player, not very wealthy._  HIS WIFE, _of the family of Tz. (rather sharp-tempered)._  STOCK, _her son, 17 years old (is studying the piano thoroughly)._  MR. BUFFALO, _music-master of the family._  DOMINIE, _piano-teacher (rather gruff)._  CECILIA, _his daughter, 13 years old (shy)._      ZACH (_to Dominie_). I regret that I was unable to attend the concert  yesterday. I was formerly musical myself and played on the flute. Your  daughter, I believe, plays pretty well.    DOMINIE. Well, yes! perhaps something more than _pretty well_. We are in  earnest about music.    MADAME, of the Tz. family (_envious because Cecilia received applause  for her public performance yesterday, and because Mr. Buffalo had been  unable to bring out Stock,--all in one breath_). When did your daughter  begin to play? Just how old is she now? Does she like playing? They say  you are very strict, and tie your daughters to the piano-stool. How many  hours a day do you make her practise? Don't you make her exert herself  too much? Has she talent? Isn't she sickly?    DOMINIE. Don't you think she looks in good health, madam,--tall and  strong for her years?    MADAME, of the Tz. family. But perhaps she might look more cheerful, if  she was not obliged to play on the piano so much.    DOMINIE (_bowing_). I can't exactly say.    ZACH (_suddenly interrupting, and holding Dominie by the button-hole_).  They say you torment and ill-treat your daughters dreadfully; that the  eldest was obliged to practise day and night. Well, you shall hear my  Stock play this evening, who, some time, by the grace of God, is to take  the place of Thalberg in the world. Now give me your opinion freely (of  course, I was only to praise): we should like very much to hear what you  think about his playing, though perhaps Mr. Buffalo may not agree with  you.         (_Mr. Buffalo is looking through the music-case and picking out all       the Etudes, by listening to which Dominie is to earn his supper._)    DOMINIE (_resigned and foreseeing that he shall be bored_). I have heard  a great deal of the industry of your son, Stock. What are you studying  now, Mr. Stock?    STOCK (_in proud self-consciousness, rather Sophomoric_). I play six  hours a day, two hours scales with both hands together, and four hours  Etudes. I have already gone through the first book of Clementi and four  books of Cramer. Now I am in the Gradus ad Parnassum: I have already  studied the right fingering for it.    DOMINIE. Indeed, you are very much in earnest: that speaks well for you,  and for Mr. Buffalo. But what pieces are you studying with the Etudes?  Hummel, Mendelssohn, Chopin, or Schumann?    STOCK (_contemptuously_). Mr. Buffalo can't bear Chopin and Schumann.  Mr. Buffalo lately played through Schumann's \"Kinderscenen,\" that people  are making such a talk about. My mamma, who is also musical, and used to  sing when papa played the flute, said, \"What ridiculous little things  are those? Are they waltzes for children? and then the babyish names"]]]
