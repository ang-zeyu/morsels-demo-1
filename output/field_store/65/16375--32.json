There's a nice thing to do!\"    \"Let me do as I please,\" said Lupin, laying an imperative stress on  every syllable. \"I'll answer for everything... I'll answer for the  two of you... Let me do as I like with you... I'll get you both out of  prison ... But I can only do that if I'm free.\"    Excited cries rose through the open window.    \"This way!\" he shouted. \"I've got them! Help!\"    And, quietly, in a whisper:    \"Just think for a moment... Have you anything to say to me?... Something  that can be of use to us?\"    Gilbert was too much taken aback to understand Lupin's plan and he  struggled furiously. Vaucheray showed more intelligence; moreover, he  had given up all hope of escape, because of his wound; and he snarled:    \"Let the governor have his way, you ass!... As long as he gets off,  isn't that the great thing?\"    Suddenly, Lupin remembered the article which Gilbert had put in his  pocket, after capturing it from Vaucheray. He now tried to take it in  his turn.    \"No, not that! Not if I know it!\" growled Gilbert, managing to release  himself.    Lupin floored him once more. But two men suddenly appeared at the  window; and Gilbert yielded and, handing the thing to Lupin, who  pocketed it without looking at it, whispered:    \"Here you are, governor... I'll explain. You can be sure that...\"    He did not have time to finish... Two policemen and others after them  and soldiers who entered through every door and window came to Lupin's  assistance.    Gilbert was at once seized and firmly bound. Lupin withdrew:    \"I'm glad you've come,\" he said. \"The beggar's given me a lot of  trouble. I wounded the other; but this one...\"    The commissary of police asked him, hurriedly:    \"Have you seen the man-servant? Have they killed him?\"    \"I don't know,\" he answered.    \"You don't know?...\"    \"Why, I came with you from Enghien, on hearing of the murder! Only,  while you were going round the left of the house, I went round the  right. There was a window open. I climbed up just as these two ruffians  were about to jump down. I fired at this one,\" pointing to Vaucheray,  \"and seized hold of his pal.\"    How could he have been suspected? He was covered with blood. He had  handed over the valet's murderers. Half a score of people had witnessed  the end of the heroic combat which he had delivered. Besides, the uproar  was too great for any one to take the trouble to argue or to waste time  in entertaining doubts. In the height of the first confusion, the people  of the neighbourhood invaded the villa. One and all lost their heads.  They ran to every side, upstairs, downstairs, to the very cellar. They  asked one another questions, yelled and shouted; and no one dreamt of  checking Lupin's statements, which sounded so plausible.    However, the discovery of the body in the pantry restored the commissary  to a sense of his responsibility. He issued orders, had the house  cleared and placed policemen at the gate to prevent any one from passing  in or out. Then, without further delay, he examined the spot and began  his inquiry. Vaucheray gave his name; Gilbert refused to give his, on  the plea that he would only speak in the presence of a lawyer. But,  when he was accused of the murder, he informed against Vaucheray,  who defended himself by denouncing the other; and the two of them  vociferated at the same time, with the evident wish to monopolize the  commissary's attention. When the commissary turned to Lupin, to request  his evidence, he perceived that the stranger was no longer there.    Without the least suspicion, he said to one of the policemen:    \"Go and tell that gentleman that I should like to ask him a few  questions.\"    They looked about for the gentleman. Some one had seen him standing on  the steps, lighting a cigarette. The next news was that he had given  cigarettes to a group of soldiers and strolled toward the lake, saying  that they were to call him if he was wanted.    They called him. No one replied.    But a soldier came running up. The gentleman had just got into a boat  and was rowing away for all he was worth. The commissary looked at  Gilbert and realized that he had been tricked:    \"Stop him!\" he shouted. \"Fire on him! He's an accomplice!...\"    He himself rushed out, followed by two policemen, while the others  remained with the prisoners. On reaching the bank, he saw the gentleman,  a hundred yards away, taking off his hat to him in the dusk.    One of the policemen discharged his revolver, without thinking.    The wind carried the sound of words across the water. The gentleman was  singing as he rowed:      \"Go, little bark,     Float in the dark...\"    But the commissary saw a skiff fastened to the landing-stage of the  adjoining property. He scrambled over the hedge separating the two  gardens and, after ordering the soldiers to watch the banks of the lake  and to seize the fugitive if he tried to put ashore, the commissary and  two of his men pulled off in pursuit of Lupin.    It was not a difficult matter, for they were able to follow his  movements by the intermittent light of the moon and to see that he was  trying to cross the lakes while bearing toward the right--that is to  say, toward the village of Saint-Gratien. Moreover, the commissary  soon perceived that, with the aid of his men and thanks perhaps to the  comparative lightness of his craft, he was rapidly gaining on the other.  In ten minutes he had decreased the interval between them by one half.    \"That's it!\" he cried. \"We shan't even need the soldiers to keep him  from landing. I very much want to make the fellow's acquaintance. He's a  cool hand and no mistake!\"    The funny thing was that the distance was now diminishing at an abnormal  rate, as though the fugitive had lost heart at realizing the futility  of the struggle. The policemen redoubled their efforts. The boat shot  across the water with the swiftness of a swallow. Another hundred yards  at most and they would reach the man.    \"Halt!\" cried the commissary.    The enemy, whose huddled shape they could make out in the boat, no  longer moved. The sculls drifted with the stream. And this absence of  all motion had something alarming about it. A ruffian of that stamp  might easily lie in wait for his aggressors, sell his life dearly and  even shoot them dead before they had a chance of attacking him.    \"Surrender!\" shouted the commissary.    The sky, at that moment, was dark. The three men lay flat at the bottom  of their skiff, for they thought they perceived a threatening gesture.    The boat, carried by its own impetus, was approaching the other.    The commissary growled:    \"We won't let ourselves be sniped. Let's fire at him. Are you ready?\"  And he roared, once more, \"Surrender... if not...!\"    No reply.    The enemy did not budge.    \"Surrender!... Hands up!... You refuse?... So much the worse for you...  I'm counting... One... Two...\"    The policemen did not wait for the word of command. They fired and, at  once, bending over their oars, gave the boat so powerful an impulse that  it reached the goal in a few strokes.    The commissary watched, revolver in hand, ready for the least movement.  He raised his arm:    \"If you stir, I'll blow out your brains!\"    But the enemy did not stir for a moment; and, when the boat was bumped  and the two men, letting go their oars, prepared for the formidable  assault, the commissary understood the reason of this passive attitude:  there was no one in the boat. The enemy had escaped by swimming, leaving  in the hands of the victor a certain number of the stolen articles,  which, heaped up and surmounted by a jacket and a bowler hat, might be  taken, at a pinch, in the semi-darkness, vaguely to represent the figure  of a man.    They struck matches and examined the enemy's cast clothes. There were no  initials in the hat. The jacket contained neither papers nor pocketbook.  Nevertheless, they made a discovery which was destined to give the case  no little celebrity and which had a terrible influence on the fate of  Gilbert and Vaucheray: in one of the pockets was a visiting-card which  the fugitive had left behind... the card of Arsene Lupin.    At almost the same moment, while the police, towing the captured skiff  behind them, continued their empty search and while the soldiers  stood drawn up on the bank, straining their eyes to try and follow the  fortunes of the naval combat, the aforesaid Arsene Lupin was quietly  landing at the very spot which he had left two hours earlier.    He was there met by his two other accomplices, the Growler and the  Masher, flung them a few sentences by way of explanation, jumped  into the motor-car, among Daubrecq the deputy's armchairs and other  valuables, wrapped himself in his furs and drove, by deserted roads,  to his repository at Neuilly, where he left the chauffeur. A  taxicab brought him back to Paris and put him down by the church of  Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, not far from which, in the Rue Matignon, he  had a flat, on the entresol-floor, of which none of his gang, excepting  Gilbert, knew, a flat with a private entrance. He was glad to take  off his clothes and rub himself down; for, in spite of his strong  constitution, he felt chilled to the bone. On retiring to bed, he  emptied the contents of his pockets, as usual, on the mantelpiece. It  was not till then that he noticed, near his pocketbook and his keys, the  object which Gilbert had put into his hand at the last moment.    And he was very much surprised. It was a decanter-stopper, a little  crystal stopper, like those used for the bottles in a liqueur-stand.  And this crystal stopper had nothing particular about it. The most that  Lupin observed was that the knob, with its many facets, was gilded right  down to the indent. But, to tell the truth, this detail did not seem to  him of a nature to attract special notice.    \"And it was this bit of glass to which Gilbert and Vaucheray attached  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15636"],[0,"The Future of Astronomy (#3)"],[1," the astronomer who would perhaps spend ten years in  studying and measuring them. The committee would have funds at their  disposal to furnish him, if necessary, with suitable measuring  instruments, assistants for reducing the results, and means for  publication. They would thus obtain the services of the most skilful  living astronomers, each in his own special line of work, and the latter  would obtain in their own homes material for study, the best that the  world could supply. Undoubtedly, by such a combination if properly  organized, results could be obtained far better than is now possible by  the best individual work, and at a relatively small expense. Many years  of preparation will evidently be needed to carry out such a plan, and to  save time we have taken the first step and have sent a skilful and  experienced observer to South Africa to study its climate and compare it  with the experience he has gained during the last twenty years from a  similar study of the climate of South America and the western portion of  the United States.    The next question to be considered is in what direction we may expect  the greatest advance in astronomy will be made. Fortunate indeed would  be the astronomer who could answer this question correctly. When Ptolemy  made the first catalogue of the stars, he little expected that his  observations would have any value nearly two thousand years later. The  alchemists had no reason to doubt that their results were as important  as those of the chemists. The astrologers were respected as much as the  astronomers. Although there is a certain amount of fashion in astronomy,  yet perhaps the best test is the judgment of those who have devoted  their lives to that science. Thirty years ago the field was narrow. It  was the era of big telescopes. Every astronomer wanted a larger  telescope than his neighbors, with which to measure double stars. If he  could not get such an instrument, he measured the positions of the stars  with a transit circle. Then came astrophysics, including photography,  spectroscopy and photometry. The study of the motion of the stars along  the line of sight, by means of photographs of their spectra, is now the  favorite investigation at nearly all the great observatories of the  world. The study of the surfaces of the planets, while the favorite  subject with the public, next to the destruction of the earth by a  comet, does not seem to appeal to astronomers. Undoubtedly, the only way  to advance our knowledge in this direction is by the most powerful  instruments, mounted in the best possible locations. Great astronomers  are very conservative, and any sensational story in the newspapers is  likely to have but little support from them. Instead of aiding, it  greatly injures real progress in science.    There is no doubt that, during the next half century, much time and  energy will be devoted to the study of the fixed stars. The study of  their motions as indicated by their change in position was pursued with  great care by the older astronomers. The apparent motions were so small  that a long series of years was required and, in general, for want of  early observations of the precise positions of the faint stars, this  work was confined mainly to the bright stars. Photography is yearly  adding a vast amount of material available for this study, but the  minuteness of the quantities to be measured renders an accurate  determination of their laws very difficult. Moreover, we can thus only  determine the motions at right angles to the line of sight, the motion  towards us or from us being entirely insensible in this way. Then came  the discovery of the change in the spectrum when a body was in motion,  but still this change was so small that visual observations of it proved  of but little value. Attaching a carefully constructed spectroscope to  one of the great telescopes of the world, photographing the spectrum of  a star, and measuring it with the greatest care, provided a tool of  wonderful efficiency. The motion, which sometimes amounts to several  hundreds of miles a second could thus be measured to within a fraction  of a mile. The discovery that the motion was variable, owing to the  star's revolving around a great dark planet sometimes larger than the  star, added greatly not only to the interest of these researches, but  also to the labor involved. Instead of a single measure for each star,  in the case of the so-called spectroscopic binaries, we must make enough  measures to determine the dimensions of the orbit, its form and the  period of revolution.    What has been said of the motions of the stars applies also, in general,  to the determination of their distances. A vast amount of labor has been  expended on this problem. When at length the distance of a single star  was finally determined, the quantity to be measured was so small as to  be nearly concealed by the unavoidable errors of measurement. The  parallax, or one half of the change in the apparent position of the  stars as the earth moves around the sun, has its largest value for the  nearest stars. No case has yet been found in which this quantity is as  large as a foot rule seen at a distance of fifty miles, and for  comparatively few stars is it certainly appreciable. An extraordinary  degree of precision has been attained in recent measures of this  quantity, but for a really satisfactory solution of this problem, we  must probably devise some new method, like the use of the spectroscope  for determining motions. Two or three illustrations of the kind of  methods which might be used to solve this problem may be of interest.  There are certain indications of the presence of a selective absorbing  medium in space. That is, a medium like red glass, for instance, which  would cut off the blue light more than the red light. Such a medium  would render the blue end of the spectrum of a distant star much  fainter, as compared with the red end, than in the case of a near star.  A measure of the relative intensity of the two rays would servo to  measure the distance, or thickness of the absorbing medium. The effect  would be the same for all stars of the same class of spectrum. It could  be tested by the stars forming a cluster, like the Pleiades, which are  doubtless all at nearly the same distance from us. The spectra of stars  of the tenth magnitude, or fainter, can be photographed well enough to  be measured in this way, so that the relative distances of nearly a  million stars could be thus determined.    Another method which would have a more limited application, would depend  on the velocity of light. It has been maintained that the velocity of  light in space is not the same for different colors. Certain stars,  called Algol stars, vary in light at regular intervals when partially  eclipsed by the interposition of a large dark satellite. Recent  observations of these eclipses, through glass of different colors, show  variations in the time of obscuration. Apparently, some of the rays  reach the earth sooner than others, although all leave the star at the  same time. As the entire time may amount to several centuries, an  excessively small difference in velocity would be recognizable. A more  delicate test would be to measure the intensity of different portions of  the spectrum at a time when the light is changing most rapidly. The  effect should be opposite according as the light is increasing or  diminishing. It should also show itself in the measures of all  spectroscopic binaries.    A third method of great promise depends on a remarkable investigation  carried on in the physical laboratory of the Case School of Applied  Science. According to the undulatory theory of light, all space is  filled with a medium called ether, like air, but as much more tenuous  than air as air is more tenuous than the densest metals. As the earth is  moving through space at the rate of several miles a second, we should  expect to feel a breeze as we rush through the ether, like that of the  air when in an automobile we are moving with but one thousandth part of  this velocity. The problem is one of the greatest delicacy, but a former  officer of the Case School, one of the most eminent of living  physicists, devised a method of solving it. The extraordinary result was  reached that no breeze was perceptible. This result appeared to be so  improbable that it has been tested again and again, but every time, the  more delicate the instrument employed, the more certainly is the law  established. If we could determine our motion with reference to the  ether, we should have a fixed line of reference to which all other  motions could be referred. This would give us a line of ever-increasing  length from which to measure stellar distances.    Still another method depends on the motion of the sun in space. There is  some evidence that this motion is not straight, but along a curved line.  We see the stars, not as they are now, but as they were when the light  left them. In the case of the distant stars this may have occurred  centuries ago. Accordingly, if we measure the motion of the sun from  them, and from near stars, a comparison with its actual motion will  give us a clue to their distances. Unfortunately, all the stars appear  to have large motions whose law we do not know, and therefore we have no  definite starting point unless we can refer all to the ether which may  be assumed to be at rest.    If the views expressed to you this morning are correct, we may expect  that the future of astronomy will take the following form: There will be  at least one very large observatory employing one or two hundred  assistants, and maintaining three stations. Two of these will be  observing stations, one in the western part of the United States, not  far from latitude +30 deg., the other similarly situated in the southern  hemisphere, probably in South Africa, in latitude -30 deg..
