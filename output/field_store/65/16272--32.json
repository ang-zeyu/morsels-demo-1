I noticed a tall,  thin, angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire.  He turned as I  drew my chair up to him.  It was the man of all others whom I should  have chosen--Tarp Henry, of the staff of Nature, a thin, dry, leathery  creature, who was full, to those who knew him, of kindly humanity.  I  plunged instantly into my subject.    \"What do you know of Professor Challenger?\"    \"Challenger?\" He gathered his brows in scientific disapproval.  \"Challenger was the man who came with some cock-and-bull story from  South America.\"    \"What story?\"    \"Oh, it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered.  I believe he has retracted since.  Anyhow, he has suppressed it all.  He gave an interview to Reuter's, and there was such a howl that he saw  it wouldn't do.  It was a discreditable business.  There were one or  two folk who were inclined to take him seriously, but he soon choked  them off.\"    \"How?\"    \"Well, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior.  There was  poor old Wadley, of the Zoological Institute.  Wadley sent a message:  'The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to  Professor Challenger, and would take it as a personal favor if he would  do them the honor to come to their next meeting.'  The answer was  unprintable.\"    \"You don't say?\"    \"Well, a bowdlerized version of it would run:  'Professor Challenger  presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute,  and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil.'\"    \"Good Lord!\"    \"Yes, I expect that's what old Wadley said.  I remember his wail at the  meeting, which began:  'In fifty years experience of scientific  intercourse----'  It quite broke the old man up.\"    \"Anything more about Challenger?\"    \"Well, I'm a bacteriologist, you know.  I live in a  nine-hundred-diameter microscope.  I can hardly claim to take serious  notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye.  I'm a  frontiersman from the extreme edge of the Knowable, and I feel quite  out of place when I leave my study and come into touch with all you  great, rough, hulking creatures.  I'm too detached to talk scandal, and  yet at scientific conversaziones I HAVE heard something of Challenger,  for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore.  He's as clever as  they make 'em--a full-charged battery of force and vitality, but a  quarrelsome, ill-conditioned faddist, and unscrupulous at that.  He had  gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American  business.\"    \"You say he is a faddist.  What is his particular fad?\"    \"He has a thousand, but the latest is something about Weissmann and  Evolution.  He had a fearful row about it in Vienna, I believe.\"    \"Can't you tell me the point?\"    \"Not at the moment, but a translation of the proceedings exists.  We  have it filed at the office.  Would you care to come?\"    \"It's just what I want.  I have to interview the fellow, and I need  some lead up to him.  It's really awfully good of you to give me a  lift.  I'll go with you now, if it is not too late.\"      Half an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge  tome in front of me, which had been opened at the article \"Weissmann  versus Darwin,\" with the sub heading, \"Spirited Protest at Vienna.  Lively Proceedings.\"  My scientific education having been somewhat  neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was  evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very  aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental  colleagues.  \"Protests,\" \"Uproar,\" and \"General appeal to the Chairman\"  were three of the first brackets which caught my eye.  Most of the  matter might have been written in Chinese for any definite meaning that  it conveyed to my brain.    \"I wish you could translate it into English for me,\" I said,  pathetically, to my help-mate.    \"Well, it is a translation.\"    \"Then I'd better try my luck with the original.\"    \"It is certainly rather deep for a layman.\"    \"If I could only get a single good, meaty sentence which seemed to  convey some sort of definite human idea, it would serve my turn.  Ah,  yes, this one will do.  I seem in a vague way almost to understand it.  I'll copy it out.  This shall be my link with the terrible Professor.\"    \"Nothing else I can do?\"    \"Well, yes; I propose to write to him.  If I could frame the letter  here, and use your address it would give atmosphere.\"    \"We'll have the fellow round here making a row and breaking the  furniture.\"    \"No, no; you'll see the letter--nothing contentious, I assure you.\"    \"Well, that's my chair and desk.  You'll find paper there.  I'd like to  censor it before it goes.\"    It took some doing, but I flatter myself that it wasn't such a bad job  when it was finished.  I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist  with some pride in my handiwork.      \"DEAR PROFESSOR CHALLENGER,\" it said, \"As a humble student of Nature, I  have always taken the most profound interest in your speculations as to  the differences between Darwin and Weissmann.  I have recently had  occasion to refresh my memory by re-reading----\"      \"You infernal liar!\" murmured Tarp Henry.      --\"by re-reading your masterly address at Vienna.  That lucid and  admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter.  There is  one sentence in it, however--namely:  'I protest strongly against the  insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a  microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly  through the series of generations.' Have you no desire, in view of  later research, to modify this statement?  Do you not think that it is  over-accentuated?  With your permission, I would ask the favor of an  interview, as I feel strongly upon the subject, and have certain  suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation.  With your consent, I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven  o'clock the day after to-morrow (Wednesday) morning.    \"I remain, Sir, with assurances of profound respect, yours very truly,    EDWARD D. MALONE.\"      \"How's that?\" I asked, triumphantly.    \"Well if your conscience can stand it----\"    \"It has never failed me yet.\"    \"But what do you mean to do?\"    \"To get there.  Once I am in his room I may see some opening.  I may  even go the length of open confession.  If he is a sportsman he will be  tickled.\"    \"Tickled, indeed!  He's much more likely to do the tickling.  Chain  mail, or an American football suit--that's what you'll want.  Well,  good-bye.  I'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning--if  he ever deigns to answer you.  He is a violent, dangerous, cantankerous  character, hated by everyone who comes across him, and the butt of the  students, so far as they dare take a liberty with him.  Perhaps it  would be best for you if you never heard from the fellow at all.\"                                     CHAPTER III                  \"He is a Perfectly Impossible Person\"    My friend's fear or hope was not destined to be realized.  When I  called on Wednesday there was a letter with the West Kensington  postmark upon it, and my name scrawled across the envelope in a  handwriting which looked like a barbed-wire railing.  The contents were  as follows:--                                    \"ENMORE PARK, W.    \"SIR,--I have duly received your note, in which you claim to endorse my  views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement  either from you or anyone else.  You have ventured to use the word  'speculation' with regard to my statement upon the subject of  Darwinism, and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word  in such a connection is offensive to a degree.  The context convinces  me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and  tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter  by.  You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have  some difficulty in understanding it.  I should have thought that only a  sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it  really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour  named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding  distasteful to me.  As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion,  I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a  deliberate expression of my mature views.  You will kindly show the  envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as he has to  take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call  themselves 'journalists.'                              \"Yours faithfully,                              \"GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER.\"      This was the letter that I read aloud to Tarp Henry, who had come down  early to hear the result of my venture.  His only remark was, \"There's  some new stuff, cuticura or something, which is better than arnica.\"  Some people have such extraordinary notions of humor.    It was nearly half-past ten before I had received my message, but a  taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment.  It was an  imposing porticoed house at which we stopped, and the heavily-curtained  windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this  formidable Professor.  The door was opened by an odd, swarthy, dried-up  person of uncertain age, with a dark pilot jacket and brown leather  gaiters.  I found afterwards that he was the chauffeur, who filled the  gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers.  He looked me up and  down with a searching light blue eye.    \"Expected?\" he asked.    \"An appointment.\"    \"Got your letter?\"    I produced the envelope.    \"Right!\"  He seemed to be a person of few words.  Following him down  the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#3)"],[1,"  the ears when I was jammin' all around here. How many are they up at  your place, did you say?\"    \"I said about twelve. If you're coming our way, stop and eat with us.\"    \"Maybe I will and maybe I won't.\" Uncle Pasco crossly shoved his box  back.    \"All right, Uncle. It's a free country,\" repeated Drake.    Not much was said after this. Uncle Pasco unwrapped his concertina from  the red handkerchief and played nimbly for his own benefit. At Silver  City he disappeared, and, finding he had stolen nothing from them, they  did not regret him. Dean Drake had some affairs to see to here before  starting for Harper's ranch, and it was pleasant to Bolles to find how  Drake was esteemed through this country. The school-master was to board  at the Malheur Agency, and had come this way round because the new  superintendent must so travel. They were scarcely birds of a feather,  Drake and Bolles, yet since one remote roof was to cover them, the  in-door man was glad this boy-host had won so much good-will from  high and low. That the shrewd old Vogel should trust so much in a  nineteen-year-old was proof enough at least of his character; but when  Brock, the foreman from Harper's, came for them at Silver City, Bolles  witnessed the affection that the rougher man held for Drake. Brock shook  the boy's hand with that serious quietness and absence of words which  shows the Western heart is speaking. After a look at Bolles and a silent  bestowing of the baggage aboard the team, he cracked his long whip and  the three rattled happily away through the dips of an open country where  clear streams ran blue beneath the winter air. They followed the Jordan  (that Idaho Jordan) west towards Oregon and the Owyhee, Brock often  turning in his driver's seat so as to speak with Drake. He had a long,  gradual chapter of confidences and events; through miles he unburdened  these to his favorite:    The California mare was coring well in harness. The eagle over at  Whitehorse ranch had fought the cat most terrible. Gilbert had got a  mule-kick in the stomach, but was eating his three meals. They had a new  boy who played the guitar. He used maple-syrup an his meat, and claimed  he was from Alabama. Brock guessed things were about as usual in most  ways. The new well had caved in again. Then, in the midst of his gossip,  the thing he had wanted to say all along came out: \"We're pleased about  your promotion,\" said he; and, blushing, shook Drake's hand again.    Warmth kindled the boy's face, and next, with a sudden severity, he  said: \"You're keeping back something.\"    The honest Brock looked blank, then labored in his memory.    \"Has the sorrel girl in Harney married you yet?\" said Drake. Brock  slapped his leg, and the horses jumped at his mirth. He was mostly  grave-mannered, but when his boy superintendent joked, he rejoiced with  the same pride that he took in all of Drake's excellences.    \"The boys in this country will back you up,\" said he, next day; and  Drake inquired: \"What news from the Malheur Agency?\"    \"Since the new Chinaman has been cooking for them,\" said Brock, \"they  have been peaceful as a man could wish.\"    \"They'll approve of me, then,\" Drake answered. \"I'm feeding 'em hyas  Christmas muck-a-muck.\"    \"And what may that be?\" asked the schoolmaster.    \"You no kumtux Chinook?\" inquired Drake. \"Travel with me and you'll  learn all sorts of languages. It means just a big feed. All whiskey is  barred,\" he added to Brock.    \"It's the only way,\" said the foreman. \"They've got those Pennsylvania  men up there.\"    Drake had not encountered these.    \"The three brothers Drinker,\" said Brock. \"Full, Half-past Full, and  Drunk are what they call them. Them's the names; they've brought them  from Klamath and Rogue River.\"    \"I should not think a Chinaman would enjoy such comrades,\" ventured Mr.  Bolles.    \"Chinamen don't have comrades in this country,\" said Brock, briefly.  \"They like his cooking. It's a lonesome section up there, and a Chinaman  could hardly quit it, not if he was expected to stay. Suppose they kick  about the whiskey rule?\" he suggested to Drake.    \"Can't help what they do. Oh, I'll give each boy his turn in Harney City  when he gets anxious. It's the whole united lot I don't propose to have  cut up on me.\"    A look of concern for the boy came over the face of foreman Brock.  Several times again before their parting did he thus look at his  favorite. They paused at Harper's for a day to attend to some matters,  and when Drake was leaving this place one of the men said to him: \"We'll  stand by you.\" But from his blithe appearance and talk as the slim boy  journeyed to the Malheur River and Headquarter ranch, nothing seemed  to be on his mind. Oregon twinkled with sun and fine white snow. They  crossed through a world of pines and creviced streams and exhilarating  silence. The little waters fell tinkling through icicles in the  loneliness of the woods, and snowshoe rabbits dived into the brush. East  Oregon, the Owyhee and the Malheur country, the old trails of General  Crook, the willows by the streams, the open swales, the high woods  where once Buffalo Horn and Chief E-egante and O-its the medicine-man  prospered, through this domain of war and memories went Bolles the  school-master with Dean Drake and Brock. The third noon from Harper's  they came leisurely down to the old Malheur Agency, where once the  hostile Indians had drawn pictures on the door, and where Castle Rock  frowned down unchanged.    \"I wish I was going to stay here with you,\" said Brock to Drake. \"By  Indian Creek you can send word to me quicker than we've come.\"    \"Why, you're an old bat!\" said the boy to his foreman, and clapped him  farewell on the shoulder.    Brock drove away, thoughtful. He was not a large man. His face was  clean-cut, almost delicate. He had a well-trimmed, yellow mustache, and  it was chiefly in his blue eye and lean cheek-bone that the frontiersman  showed. He loved Dean Drake more than he would ever tell, even to  himself.    The young superintendent set at work to ranch-work this afternoon of  Brock's leaving, and the buccaroos made his acquaintance one by one and  stared at him. Villany did not sit outwardly upon their faces; they were  not villains; but they stared at the boy sent to control them, and they  spoke together, laughing. Drake took the head of the table at supper,  with Bolles on his right. Down the table some silence, some staring,  much laughing went on--the rich brute laugh of the belly untroubled by  the brain. Sam, the Chinaman, rapid and noiseless, served the dishes.    \"What is it?\" said a buccaroo.    \"Can it bite?\" said another.    \"If you guess what it is, you can have it,\" said a third.    \"It's meat,\" remarked Drake, incisively, helping himself; \"and tougher  than it looks.\"    The brute laugh rose from the crowd and fell into surprised silence; but  no rejoinder came, and they ate their supper somewhat thoughtfully. The  Chinaman's quick, soft eye had glanced at Dean Drake when they laughed.  He served his dinner solicitously. In his kitchen that evening he and  Bolles unpacked the good things--the olives, the dried fruits, the  cigars--brought by the new superintendent for Christmas; and finding  Bolles harmless, like his gentle Asiatic self, Sam looked cautiously  about and spoke:    \"You not know why they laugh,\" said he. \"They not talk about my meat  then. They mean new boss, Misser Dlake. He velly young boss.\"    \"I think,\" said Bolles, \"Mr. Drake understood their meaning, Sam. I have  noticed that at times he expresses himself peculiarly. I also think they  understood his meaning.\"    The Oriental pondered. \"Me like Misser Dlake,\" said he. And drawing  quite close, he observed, \"They not nice man velly much.\"    Next day and every day \"Misser Dlake\" went gayly about his business, at  his desk or on his horse, vigilant, near and far, with no sign save a  steadier keenness in his eye. For the Christmas dinner he provided  still further sending to the Grande Ronde country for turkeys and other  things. He won the heart of Bolles by lending him a good horse; but the  buccaroos, though they were boisterous over the coming Christmas joy,  did not seem especially grateful. Drake, however, kept his worries to  himself.    \"This thing happens anywhere,\" he said one night in the office to  Bolles, puffing a cigar. \"I've seen a troop of cavalry demoralize itself  by a sort of contagion from two or three men.\"    \"I think it was wicked to send you here by yourself,\" blurted Bolles.    \"Poppycock! It's the chance of my life, and I'll jam her through or  bust.\"    \"I think they have decided you are getting turkeys because you are  afraid of them,\" said Bolles.    \"Why, of course! But d' you figure I'm the man to abandon my Christmas  turkey because my motives for eating it are misconstrued?\"    Dean Drake smoked for a while; then a knock came at the door. Five  buccaroos entered and stood close, as is the way with the guilty who  feel uncertain.    \"We were thinking as maybe you'd let us go over to town,\" said Half-past  Full, the spokesman.    \"When?\"    \"Oh, any day along this week.\"    \"Can't spare you till after Christmas.\"    \"Maybe you'll not object to one of us goin'?\"    \"You'll each have your turn after this week.\"    A slight pause followed. Then Half-past Full said: \"What would you do if  I went, anyway?\"    \"Can't imagine,\" Drake answered, easily. \"Go, and I'll be in a position  to inform you.\"    The buccaroo dropped his stolid bull eyes, but raised them again and  grinned. \"Well, I'm not particular about goin' this week, boss.\"    \"That's not my name,\" said Drake, \"but it's what I am.\"    They stood a moment. Then they shuffled out. It was an orderly  retreat--almost.    Drake winked over to Bolles. \"That was a graze,\" said he, and smoked for  a while. \"They'll not go this time. Question is, will they go next?\"      III    Drake took a fresh cigar, and threw his "]]]
