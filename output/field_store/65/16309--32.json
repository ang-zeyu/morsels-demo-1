He  bore up against the homesickness as best he could, and when he could  bear it no longer, resolved to run away from the making of toy bureaus,  to be once more with the Bartletts. He had partly executed this  resolution, being several miles on the road to his old home, when his  master, the cabinetmaker, caught up to him and returned him to  Haverhill. But when he heard the little fellow's story of homesickness  and yearning for loved places and faces, he was not angry with him, but  did presently release him from his apprenticeship. And so the boy to his  great joy found himself again in Newburyport and with the good old  wood-sawyer. Poverty and experience were teaching the child what he  never could have learned in a grammar-school, a certain acquaintance  with himself and the world around him. There was growing within his  breast a self-care and a self-reliance. It was the autumn of 1818, when,  so to speak, the boy's primary education in the school of experience  terminated, and he entered on the second stage of his training under the  same rough tutelage. At the age of thirteen he entered the office of the  Newburyport _Herald_ to learn to set types. At last his boy's hands had  found work which his boy's heart did joy to have done. He soon mastered  the compositor's art, became a remarkably rapid composer. As he set up  the thoughts of others, he was not slow in discovering thoughts of his  own demanding utterance. The printer's apprentice felt the stirrings of  a new life. A passion for self-improvement took possession of him. He  began to read the English classics, study American history, follow the  currents of party politics. No longer could it be said of him that he  was not an apt pupil. He was indeed singularly apt. His intelligence  quickened marvelously. The maturing process was sudden and swift. Almost  before one knows it the boy in years has become a man in judgment and  character. This precipitate development of the intellectual life in him,  produced naturally enough an appreciable enlargement of the _ego_. The  young eagle had abruptly awakened to the knowledge that he possessed  wings; and wings were for use--to soar with. Ambition, the desire to  mount aloft, touched and fired the boy's mind. As he read, studied, and  observed, while his hands were busy with his work, there was a constant  fluttering going on in the eyrie of his thoughts. By an instinct  analogous to that which sends a duck to the water, the boy took to the  discussion of public questions. It was as if an innate force was  directing him toward his mission--the reformation of great public  wrongs. At sixteen he made his first contribution to the press. It was a  discussion of a quasi-social subject, the relation of the sexes in  society. He was at the impressionable age, when the rosy god of love is  at his tricks. He was also at a stage of development, when boys are  least attractive, when they are disagreeably virile, full of their own  importance and the superiority of their sex. In the \"Breach of the  Marriage Promise,\" by \"An Old Bachelor,\" these signs of adolescence are  by no means wanting, they are, on the contrary, distinctly present and  palpable. But there were other signs besides these, signs that the youth  had had his eyes wide open to certain difficulties which beset the  matrimonial state and to the conventional steps which lead to it, and  that he had thought quite soberly, if not altogether wisely upon them.  The writer was verdant, to be sure, and self-conscious, and partial in  his view of the relations of the sexes, but there was withal a serious  purpose in the writing. He meant to expose and correct what he conceived  to be reprehensible conduct on the part of the gentler sex, bad feminine  manners. Just now he sees the man's side of the shield, a few years  later he will see the woman's side also. He ungallantly concludes \"to  lead the '_single life_,' and not,\" as he puts it, \"trouble myself about  the ladies.\" A most sapient conclusion, considering that this veteran  misogynist was but sixteen years old. During the year following the  publication of this article, he plied his pen with no little  industry--producing in all fifteen articles on a variety of topics, such  as \"South American Affairs,\" \"State Politics,\" \"A Glance at Europe,\"  etc., all of which are interesting now chiefly as showing the range of  his growing intelligence, and as the earliest steps by which he acquired  his later mastery of the pen and powerful style of composition. In a  letter addressed to his mother about this time, the boy is full of  Lloyd, undisguisedly proud of Lloyd, believes in Lloyd. \"When I peruse  them over\" (_i.e._ those fifteen communications to the press), \"I feel  absolutely astonished,\" he naively confesses, \"at the different subjects  which I have discussed, and the style in which they are written. Indeed  it is altogether a matter of surprise that I have met with such signal  success, seeing I do not understand _one single rule of grammar_, and  having a very inferior education.\" The printer's lad was plainly not  lacking in the bump of approbativeness, or the quality of  self-assertiveness. The quick mother instinct of Fanny Garrison took  alarm at the tone of her boy's letter. Possibly there was something in  Lloyd's florid sentences, in his facility of expression, which reminded  her of Abijah. He, too, poor fellow, had had gifts in the use of the  pen, and what had he done, what had he come to? Had he not forsaken wife  and children by first forsaking the path of holiness? So she pricks the  boy's bubble, and points him to the one thing needful--God in the soul.  But in her closing words she betrays what we all along suspected, her  own secret pleasure in her son's success, when she asks, \"Will you be so  kind as to bring on your pieces that you have written for me to see?\"  Ah! was she not every inch a mother, and how Lloyd did love her. But she  was no longer what she had been. And no wonder, for few women have been  called to endure such heavy burdens, fight so hopelessly the battle for  bread, all the while her heart was breaking with grief. Disease had made  terrible inroads upon her once strong and beautiful person. Not the  shadow of the strength and beauty of her young womanhood remained. She  was far away from her early home and friends, far away from her darling  boy, in Baltimore. James, her pride, was at sea, Elizabeth, a sweet  little maiden of twelve, had left her to take that last voyage beyond  another sea, and Abijah, without one word of farewell, with the silence  of long years unbroken, he, too, also! had hoisted sail and was gone  forever. And now in her loneliness and sorrow, knowing that she, too,  must shortly follow, a great yearning rose up in her poor wounded heart  to see once more her child, the comfort and stay of her bitter life. And  as she had written to him her wish and longing, the boy went to her, saw  the striking change, saw that the broken spirit of the saintly woman was  day by day nearing the margin of the dark hereafter, into whose healing  waters it would bathe and be whole again. The unspeakable experience of  mother and son, during this last meeting is not for you and me, reader,  to look into. Soon after Lloyd's return to Newburyport a cancerous tumor  developed on her shoulder, from the effects of which she died September  3, 1823, at the age of forty-five. More than a decade after her death  her son wrote: \"She has been dead almost eleven years; but my grief at  her loss is as fresh and poignant now as it was at that period;\" and he  breaks out in praise of her personal charms in the following original  lines:      \"She was the masterpiece of womankind--    In shape and height majestically fine;    Her cheeks the lily and the rose combined;    Her lips--more opulently red than wine;    Her raven locks hung tastefully entwined;    Her aspect fair as Nature could design;    And then her eyes! so eloquently bright!    An eagle would recoil before her light.\"      The influence of this superb woman was a lasting power for truth and  righteousness in the son's stormy life. For a whole year after her  death, the grief of the printer's lad over his loss, seemed to have  checked the activity of his pen. For during that period nothing of his  appeared in the _Herald_. But after the sharp edge of his sorrow had  worn off, his pen became active again in the discussion of public men  and public questions. It was a period of bitter personal and political  feuds and animosities. The ancient Federal party was _in articulo  mortis_. The death-bed of a great political organization proves  oftentimes the graveyard of lifelong friendships. For it is a scene of  crimination and recrimination. And so it happened that the partisans of  John Adams, and the partisans of John Adams's old Secretary of State,  Timothy Pickering, were in 1824 doing a thriving business in this  particular line. Into this funereal performance our printer's apprentice  entered with pick and spade. He had thus early a _penchant_ for  controversy, a soldier's scent for battle. If there was any fighting  going on he proceeded directly to have a hand in it. And it cannot be  denied that that hand was beginning to deal some manly and sturdy blows,  whose resound was heard quite distinctly beyond the limits of his  birthplace. His communications appeared now, not only in the _Herald_,  but in the Salem _Gazette_ as well. Now it was the Adams-Pickering  controversy, now the discussion of General Jackson as a presidential  candidate, now the state of the country in respect of parties, now the  merits of \"American Writers,\" which afforded his 'prentice hand the  requisite practice in the use of the pen. He had already acquired a  perfect knowledge of typesetting and the mechanical makeup of a  newspaper. During his apprenticeship he took his first lesson in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#3)"],[1,"AND LEPTALIS ORISE      24.

The title of Mr. Darwin's great work is--_On the Origin of Species by  means of Natural Selection and the Preservation of Favoured Races in the  Struggle for Life_. In order to appreciate fully the aim and object of  this work, and the change which it has effected not only in natural  history but in many other sciences, it is necessary to form a clear  conception of the meaning of the term \"species,\" to know what was the  general belief regarding them at the time when Mr. Darwin's book first  appeared, and to understand what he meant, and what was generally meant,  by discovering their \"origin.\" It is for want of this preliminary  knowledge that the majority of educated persons who are not naturalists  are so ready to accept the innumerable objections, criticisms, and  difficulties of its opponents as proofs that the Darwinian theory is  unsound, while it also renders them unable to appreciate, or even to  comprehend, the vast change which that theory has effected in the whole  mass of thought and opinion on the great question of evolution.    The term \"species\" was thus defined by the celebrated botanist De  Candolle: \"A species is a collection of all the individuals which  resemble each other more than they resemble anything else, which can by  mutual fecundation produce fertile individuals, and which reproduce  themselves by generation, in such a manner that we may from analogy  suppose them all to have sprung from one single individual.\" And the  zoologist Swainson gives a somewhat similar definition: \"A species, in  the usual acceptation of the term, is an animal which, in a state of  nature, is distinguished by certain peculiarities of form, size, colour,  or other circumstances, from another animal. It propagates, 'after its  kind,' individuals perfectly resembling the parent; its peculiarities,  therefore, are permanent.\"[1]    To illustrate these definitions we will take two common English birds,  the rook (Corvus frugilegus) and the crow (Corvus corone). These are  distinct _species_, because, in the first place, they always differ from  each other in certain slight peculiarities of structure, form, and  habits, and, in the second place, because rooks always produce rooks,  and crows produce crows, and they do not interbreed. It was therefore  concluded that all the rooks in the world had descended from a single  pair of rooks, and the crows in like manner from a single pair of crows,  while it was considered impossible that crows could have descended from  rooks or _vice versa_. The \"origin\" of the first pair of each kind was a  mystery. Similar remarks may be applied to our two common plants, the  sweet violet (Viola odorata) and the dog violet (Viola canina). These  also produce their like and never produce each other or intermingle, and  they were therefore each supposed to have sprung from a single  individual whose \"origin\" was unknown. But besides the crow and the rook  there are about thirty other kinds of birds in various parts of the  world, all so much like our species that they receive the common name of  crows; and some of them differ less from each other than does our crow  from our rook. These are all _species_ of the genus Corvus, and were  therefore believed to have been always as distinct as they are now,  neither more nor less, and to have each descended from one pair of  ancestral crows of the same identical species, which themselves had an  unknown \"origin.\" Of violets there are more than a hundred different  kinds in various parts of the world, all differing very slightly from  each other and forming distinct _species_ of the genus Viola. But, as  these also each produce their like and do not intermingle, it was  believed that every one of them had always been as distinct from all the  others as it is now, that all the individuals of each kind had descended  from one ancestor, but that the \"origin\" of these hundred slightly  differing ancestors was unknown. In the words of Sir John Herschel,  quoted by Mr. Darwin, the origin of such species was \"the mystery of  mysteries.\"      _The Early Transmutationists_.    A few great naturalists, struck by the very slight difference between  many of these species, and the numerous links that exist between the  most different forms of animals and plants, and also observing that a  great many species do vary considerably in their forms, colours, and  habits, conceived the idea that they might be all produced one from the  other. The most eminent of these writers was a great French naturalist,  Lamarck, who published an elaborate work, the _Philosophie Zoologique_,  in which he endeavoured to prove that all animals whatever are descended  from other species of animals. He attributed the change of species  chiefly to the effect of changes in the conditions of life--such as  climate, food, etc.--and especially to the desires and efforts of the  animals themselves to improve their condition, leading to a modification  of form or size in certain parts, owing to the well-known physiological  law that all organs are strengthened by constant use, while they are  weakened or even completely lost by disuse. The arguments of Lamarck did  not, however, satisfy naturalists, and though a few adopted the view  that closely allied species had descended from each other, the general  belief of the educated public was, that each species was a \"special  creation\" quite independent of all others; while the great body of  naturalists equally held, that the change from one species to another by  any known law or cause was impossible, and that the \"origin of species\"  was an unsolved and probably insoluble problem. The only other important  work dealing with the question was the celebrated _Vestiges of  Creation_, published anonymously, but now acknowledged to have been  written by the late Robert Chambers. In this work the action of general  laws was traced throughout the universe as a system of growth and  development, and it was argued that the various species of animals and  plants had been produced in orderly succession from each other by the  action of unknown laws of development aided by the action of external  conditions. Although this work had a considerable effect in influencing  public opinion as to the extreme improbability of the doctrine of the  independent \"special creation\" of each species, it had little effect  upon naturalists, because it made no attempt to grapple with the problem  in detail, or to show in any single case how the allied species of a  genus could have arisen, and have preserved their numerous slight and  apparently purposeless differences from each other. No clue whatever was  afforded to a law which should produce from any one species one or more  slightly differing but yet permanently distinct species, nor was any  reason given why such slight yet constant differences should exist at  all.      _Scientific Opinion before Darwin._    In order to show how little effect these writers had upon the public  mind, I will quote a few passages from the writings of Sir Charles  Lyell, as representing the opinions of the most advanced thinkers in the  period immediately preceding that of Darwin's work. When recapitulating  the facts and arguments in favour of the invariability and permanence of  species, he says: \"The entire variation from the original type which any  given kind of change can produce may usually be effected in a brief  period of time, after which no further deviation can be obtained by  continuing to alter the circumstances, though ever so gradually,  indefinite divergence either in the way of improvement or deterioration  being prevented, and the least possible excess beyond the defined limits  being fatal to the existence of the individual.\" In another place he  maintains that \"varieties of some species may differ more than other  species do from each other without shaking our confidence in the reality  of species.\" He further adduces certain facts in geology as being, in  his opinion, \"fatal to the theory of progressive development,\" and he  explains the fact that there are so often distinct species in countries  of similar climate and vegetation by \"special creations\" in each  country; and these conclusions were arrived at after a careful study of  Lamarck's work, a full abstract of which is given in the earlier  editions "]]]
