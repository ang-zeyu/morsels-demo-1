On this basis the most ancient mounds are those  specified above, while the most recent are those in the immediate  vicinity of the Casa Grande ruin. This estimate accords well with the  limited historical data and with the Pima traditions, which recount that  the Casa Grande ruin was the last inhabited village in this vicinity.    [Illustration: Fig. 328.--Map of large mound.]    Probably intermediate in time between the Casa Grande ruin and the  rounded mounds described above should be placed the large structure  occupying the northern-central part of the map. This mound is deserving  of more than a passing notice. It consists of two mounds, each four or  five times the size of the Casa Grande ruin, resting on a flat-topped  pedestal or terrace about 5 feet above the general level. The summits of  these mounds, which are nearly flat, are some 13 feet above this level.  The sides of the mounds slope very sharply, and have suffered somewhat  from erosion, being cut by deep gullies, as shown in figure 328, which  is an enlargement from the map. It has been stated that these structures  were mounds, pure and simple, used for sacrifice or worship, resembling  somewhat the well-known pyramid of Cholula; but there is no doubt that  they are the remains of house-structures, for a careful examination of  the surface on the slopes, reveals the ends of regular walls. The height  is not exceptional, the mound on the east being less than 3 feet lower,  while the one on the southeast lacks less than 4 feet of its height. The  characteristic feature, however, and one difficult to explain, except on  the hypothesis stated, is the sharp slope of the sides. It will be  noticed that the raised base or terrace on which the mounds are located  is not perfectly flat, but on the contrary has a raised rim. This rim  seems quite inconsistent with the theory which has been advanced that  the terrace was built up solidly as a terrace or base, as in that case  it would seem natural that the slope from the base of the mounds to the  edge of the terrace would be continuous.    There is an abundance of room between the crest of the rim and the base  of the terrace for a row of single rooms, inclosing a court within which  the main structures stood, or such a court may have been covered, wholly  or partly with clusters of rooms, single storied outside, but rising in  the center, in two main clusters, three or more stories high. Such an  agglomeration of rooms might under certain conditions produce the result  seen here, although a circumscribing heavy wall, occupying the position  of the crest of the rim and inclosing two main clusters each rising  three or more stories, might also produce this result. The difficulty  with the latter hypothesis is, however, that under it we should expect  to find a greater depression between the base of the mounds and the edge  of the terrace. The most reasonable hypothesis, therefore, is that the  space between the base of the mounds and the edge of the terrace was  occupied by rooms of one story. This would also help to explain the  steepness of the slopes of the mounds themselves. The walls of the  structures they represent, being protected by the adjacent low walls of  the one-story rooms, would not suffer appreciably by undermining at the  ground level, and if the central room or rooms of each cluster were  higher than the surrounding rooms, as is the case in the Casa Grande  ruin, the exterior walls, being usually heavier than the inner walls,  would be the last to succumb, the clusters would be filled up by the  disintegration of the inner walls, and not until the spaces between the  low one-story walls surrounding the central cluster were nearly filled  up would the pronounced disintegration of the outer walls of the  structures commence. At that period the walls were probably covered and  protected by debris dropping from above, and possibly the profile of the  mounds was already established, being only slightly modified by surface  erosion since.    [Illustration: Pl. LII: Ground Plan of Casa Grande Ruin.]    About the center of the eastern side of the terrace, and also on the  western side, the water which falls on the surface of the structure is  discharged through rather pronounced depressions at these points. These  depressions are not the work of running water, though doubtless  emphasized by that agency, but represent low or open spaces in the  original structure, probably passageways or gateways. Furthermore,  before or inside each gateway there is a slightly depressed area, just  where we would expect to find it under our hypothesis, and showing that  the process of filling in is not yet completed. If the structure were to  remain undisturbed for some decades longer these spaces would doubtless  be filled up from material washed from the mounds, giving eventually a  continuous slope from the base of the mounds to the edge of the terrace.    On the eastern margin of the map and in the southeastern corner two  small and sharply defined mounds, differing in character from any others  of the group, are represented. That shown on the eastern margin rises  about 6 feet and the other about 10 feet above the surrounding level,  and both stand out alone, no other remains occurring within a hundred  yards in any direction. These mounds seem a thing apart from the other  remains in the group; and it is probable that they represent the latest  period in the occupancy of this site, or possibly a period subsequent to  its final abandonment as a place of residence. Analogous remains occur  in conjunction with some large ruins in the north, and there they  represent single rooms, parts of the original structure kept in a fair  state of preservation by occasional repairs while the remainder of the  village was going to ruin, and used as farming outlooks long after the  site was abandoned as a place of residence. As these farming outlooks  have been discussed at some length in another paper[1] it is not  necessary here to enlarge upon their function and the important part  they play in Pueblo architecture. If the high mounds in question mark,  as supposed, the sites of farming outlooks such as those which are found  in the north, they indicate that the occupancy of the region in which  they occur was continued after the abandonment of the Casa Grande  structure by the people who built it or by people of similar habits and  customs.        [Footnote 1: A Study of Pueblo Architecture; 8th Ann. Rep. Bur.      Eth., 1891, pp. 86, 227, and elsewhere.]    An inspection of the map will show a number of depressions, some of  quite large area, indicated by dotted contour lines. The principal one  occurs a little west of the center of the area, and is worth more than a  passing notice since similar structures are widely distributed  throughout this region. It may be roughly characterized as a mound with  excavated center. The ground for some distance about the structure  (except for two depressions discussed later) is quite flat. From this  flat surface as a base the structure rises to a height of 5 feet. From  the exterior it has the appearance of an ordinary mound, but on reaching  the top the interior is found to be hollowed out to a depth which even  at the present day is below the surrounding surface, although not below  the depressions adjoining. The main structure or mound is shown in  figure 329 (an enlargement from the map). It measures on top of the  crest 150 feet from north to south and about 80 feet from east to west,  but covers a ground area of 200 feet by 120 feet or over half an acre.  The crest is of the same height throughout, except for slight elevations  on the eastern and western sides and a little knoll or swell in the  southwestern corner. There is no indication of any break in the  continuity of the crest such as would be found were there openings or  gateways to the interior. The bottom of the depression in the main  structure is at present about a foot below the surrounding ground  surface, but it must have been originally considerably more than this,  as the profile indicates long exposure to atmospheric erosion and  consequent filling of the interior. No excavation was made and the  character of the construction can not be determined, but the mound is  apparently a simple earth structure--not laid up in blocks, like the  Casa Grande ruin.    [Illustration: Fig. 329.--Map of hollow mound.]    [Illustration: Pl. LIII: General View of Casa Grande.]    To the east and to the west are two large depressions, each about 5 feet  below the surrounding ground surface, evidently the places whence the  material for the construction of the mound was obtained. Yet the amount  of material removed from these excavations must have been considerably  in excess of that used in the construction of the mound, and this excess  was doubtless utilized in neighboring constructions, since it is hardly  to be supposed that it was carried away to any considerable distance.    The purpose of this hollow mound, which is a fair type of many similar  structures found in this region, is not clear. Mr. Frank Hamilton  Cushing, while director of the Hemenway southwestern archeological  expedition, found a number of these structures and excavated some of  them. From remains thus found he concluded that they were sun-temples,  as he termed them, and that they were covered with a roof made of coiled  strands of grass, after a manner analogous to that in which pueblo  baskets are made. A somewhat similar class of structures was found by  the writer on the upper Rio Verde, but these were probably thrashing  floors. Possibly the structure under discussion was for a similar  purpose, yet its depth in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17488"],[0,"The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891 (#3)"],[1," an inch or two and faced with that thickness of  cement mortar. Plate CXX shows the south front and plate CXXI the south  and east fronts when the brickwork was completed, but before it was  plastered, and will illustrate what was planned better than can a  description.    This treatment, it was believed, would give a surface capable of  effectually resisting atmospheric influences and the destructive action  of flying sand, and at the same time would not disfigure the ruin by  making the repairs obtrusive.    The broken-out lintels of openings were to be replaced, and the cavities  above them filled in with brick faced with mortar similar to the  underpinning.    The south wall, which was in a dangerous condition, was to be supported  by three internal braces, as shown in the plan, plate CXVII. The longest  brace or beam was necessarily of wood, as the wide range of temperature  in this region, even between day and night, would produce so much  expansion and contraction in an iron rod 60 feet long that without some  compensating device the wall would be rocked on its base and its rapid  destruction necessarily follow.      EXECUTION OF THE WORK    Appended to that portion of the sundry civil appropriation act approved  March. 2, 1889,[1] in which certain expenses of the United States  Geological Survey are provided for, is the following item:      Repair of the ruin of Casa Grande, Arizona: To enable the Secretary    of the Interior to repair and protect the ruin of Casa Grande,    situate in Pinal County, near Florence, Arizona, two thousand    dollars; and the President is authorized to reserve from settlement    and sale the land on which said ruin is situated and so much of the    public land adjacent thereto as in his judgment may be necessary for    the protection of said ruin and of the ancient city of which it is a    part.        [Footnote 1: 25 Statutes, p. 961.]    On the 12th of April, 1889, there was a conference between the Secretary  of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office looking  to the execution of the law, and on the 16th of that month the  Commissioner submitted a statement on the subject, calling attention to  the fact that the appropriation would not be available until July 1  following, and suggesting that a special agent should be sent out to  examine the ruin. This suggestion was approved, and on April 27, 1889,  Special Agent Alexander L. Morrison, of the General Land Office, was  instructed to proceed to the ruins for the purpose of investigating and  reporting as to what method should be adopted for their repair and  protection. Mr Morrison was further instructed to report \"all the facts  obtainable as regards said ruins of 'Casa Grande,' in order that  appropriate action may be taken by the Department for its preservation.\"    On May 15,1889, Mr Morrison submitted a report to the Commissioner,  describing his journey, the location of the ruin, the ruin itself, and  other ruins in the vicinity. He stated that danger to the ruin was of  three kinds--(1) by vandalism, (2) by elements, (3) by undermining. He  recommended the construction of a roof and an underpinning of stone for  the walls. Finally, he gave some historical notes, and closed with a  peroration.    Mr Morrison's plans were found impracticable, as their execution would  require an expenditure of many times the sum appropriated, and on  September 23, 1889, all the papers in the case were transmitted by the  Secretary to the Director of the Geological Survey, \"for appropriate  action under the clause of the act referred to, as being within the  province of your Bureau.\" It was ordered that the work be commenced  without the least delay, and November 27, 1889, Mr Victor Mindeleff, of  the Bureau of Ethnology, was detailed by the Director and ordered to  proceed to the ruin and report on the best means of repairing it and  protecting it from further destruction. He was also directed to make  other investigations in the vicinity, which have no relation to the  present case.    On July 1, 1890, Mr Mindeleff submitted a report. He described the ruins  of which Casa Grande is the type, and also Casa Grande itself. He also  made a statement of the condition of the ruin and suggested that the  main destruction \"was due to the undermining of the walls, and stated  that much damage had been done by tourists. He recommended (1) that an  area about the ruin be fenced in; (2) that a man be located permanently  on the ground to watch the ruins; (3) that the ruins be cleaned out; (4)  that the walls be underpinned with brick instead of stone, as previously  suggested; (5) that the tops of the walls, after removing several inches  to afford a good bearing surface, be treated with a coping of cement. It  was regarded that this plan, if carried into effect, would afford  sufficient protection against the weather, but a plan for a roof was  submitted should such a structure be deemed desirable and practicable.  Mr Mindeleff also recommended a number of tie-rods and beams, the  replacement of the broken-out lintels, and the filling of the cavities  above.    This plan was approved in its general features, but the means provided  for its execution were found insufficient. A further complication arose  from the fact that a few months later Mr Mindeleff severed his  connection with the Bureau of Ethnology and his knowledge became no  longer available.    November 20, 1890, the writer was ordered to proceed to the ruin and  inaugurate the work of repair, following, so far as practicable, the  plans already approved. He left Washington soon afterward and reached  the ruin late in December. It was found necessary to make a detailed  survey of the ruin and of the group of which it forms a part, and to  make plans and sections showing the probable amount of excavation for  the use of those who were invited to bid on the work. Furthermore, the  amount appropriated was so well known to be inadequate that great  difficulty was experienced in obtaining bids, and it was only through  the efficient cooperation of the Reverend I. T. Whittemore at Florence  and of Mr C. A. Garlick at Phoenix that success was finally achieved.  Two bids were received from the former place and one from the latter;  but this was not accomplished until March 17, 1891, the date when the  last bid was received. In the meantime the writer, having completed his  work at Casa Grande, so far as he could, had entered, in January, on an  archeologic investigation of the valley of the Rio Verde, in compliance  with his orders to that effect.    It was found impossible to execute all the work deemed requisite for the  preservation of the ruin within the limits of the appropriation. A  selection of items became necessary, therefore, and those which were of  most importance were chosen. Even in this, however, it was found that a  maximum limit on the amount of work to be done on each item must be set,  and this limit was considerably below the amount of work estimated to be  necessary.    The first thing to be done was, of course, the clearing out of the  rubbish and debris. The item next in importance was the underpinning of  the walls with brick wherever it was needed. The third item was the  restoration of the lintels and the filling of the cavities above them.  The fourth item was the tying in of the south wall, or of the several  parts of it, with braces. This was the only feature of the plan which  would appreciably disfigure the ruin, but some such device was deemed  essential for the preservation of the south wall.    These four items consumed practically all of the amount appropriated,  and the other items of the original plan were therefore omitted. The bid  of T. L. Stouffer and F. E. White, of Florence, Arizona, covering the  four items, was accepted, and a contract was made with them, under date  of May 9, 1891, for the execution of the work for the sum of $1,985.  This contract, together with the specifications, plans, and other  drawings which formed part of it, accompany this report. It was  transmitted to the Director of the Geological Survey, and by him  approved and forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior June 6, 1891. It  was approved by the Acting Secretary June 20, 1891. Finally, on July 20,  1891, it was placed on file, together \"with the bids, proposals, and all  the original papers.\"    A time limit of two months was made in the contract, expiring August 20,  1891, but it was changed to four months from July 1, 1891, expiring  October 31, 1891. Before the time expired, however, Mr H. G. Rizer, then  chief clerk of the Bureau of Ethnology, was ordered to proceed to Casa  Grande ruin to examine the work done and, if in accord with the terms of  the contract and the specifications, to certify the amount due the  contractors. He submitted a report, under date of November 24, 1891,  which is appended hereto. He also obtained six photographic negatives of  the work as it stood a short time before its completion, and two of  these (reproduced in plates CXX and CXXI) have been utilized in the  preparation of this report.    Mr Rizer found that a considerable amount of work had been done by the  contractors in excess of that authorized, and also that not sufficient  work had been done to render the repairs permanently effective. Under  the terms of the contract, no amount in excess of that stated ($1,985)  could be paid, and payment of this amount was made late in 1891. On  January 7, 1892, the contractors filed a claim for extra work on the  ruin amounting to $600.40. The work was actually performed, but the  terms of the contract were clear, and the claim was therefore  disapproved January 28, 1892.    It would have been desirable to have had a supervisor of the work, but  as the contract consumed practically all of the amount appropriated no  provision could be made for one. It is fortunate, therefore, that the  Reverend I. T. Whittemore,"]]]
