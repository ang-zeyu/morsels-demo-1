Such societies may be  termed voluntary. The differentia between the natal and the voluntary  association lies in the fact that in the former all are members of one  or other grade, in the latter only such as have taken steps to gain  admission, all others being simply non-members.    Although _prima facie_ all these forms of association are equally  entitled to be classed as social organisations, the use of this term is  limited in practice, at any rate as regards Australia, and is the  accepted designation of the kinship form of natal associations only; for  this limitation there is so far justification, that though they perhaps  play a smaller part in the daily life of the people than the secret  societies of some areas, with their club-houses and other features which  determine the whole form of life, the kinship associations are normally  regulative of marriage and thus exercise an influence in a field of  their own.    Marriage prohibitions in the various races of mankind show an almost  endless diversity of form; but all are based on considerations either of  consanguinity or kinship or on a combination of the two. The distinction  between _consanguinity_ and _kinship_ first demands attention; the  former depends on birth, the latter on the law or custom of the  community, and this distinction is all-important, especially in dealing  with primitive peoples. With ourselves the two usually coincide, though  even in civilised communities there are variations in this respect.  Thus, according to the law of England, the father of an illegitimate  child is not akin to it, though _ex hypothesi_ there is a tie of blood  between them. In England nothing short of an Act of Parliament can make  them akin; but in Scotland the subsequent marriage of the father with  the mother of the child changes the legal status of the latter and makes  it of kin with its father. These two examples make it abundantly evident  that kinship is with us a matter of law.    Among primitive peoples kinship occupies a similar position but with  important differences. As with us, it is a sociological fact; custom,  which has among them far more power than law among us, determines  whether a man is of kin to his mother and her relatives alone, or to his  father and father's relatives, or whether both sets of relatives are  alike of kin to him. In the latter case, where parental kinship  prevails, the limits of the kin are often determined by the facts of  consanguinity. In the two former cases, where kinship is reckoned  through males alone or through females alone, consanguinity has little  or nothing to do with kinship, as will be shown more in detail below.    Kinship is sociological, consanguinity physiological; in thus stating  the case we are concerned only with broad principles. In practice the  idea of consanguinity is modified in two ways and a sociological element  is introduced, which has gone far to obscure the difference between  these two systems of laying the foundations of human society. In the  first place, custom determines the limits within which consanguinity is  supposed to exist; or, in other words, at what point the descendants of  a given ancestor cease to be blood relations. In the second place  erroneous physiological ideas modify the ideas held as to actually  existing consanguine relations, as we conceive them. The latter  peculiarity does not affect the enquiry to any extent; it merely limits  the sphere within which consanguinity plays a part, side by side with  kinship, in moulding social institutions. If an Australian tribe, for  example, distinguishes the actual mother of a child from the other women  who go by the same kinship name, they may or may not develop on parallel  lines their ideas as to the relation of the child and his real father.  Some relation will almost certainly be found to exist between them; but  it by no means follows that it arises from any idea of consanguinity. In  other communities potestas and not consanguinity is held to determine  the relations of the husband of a woman to her offspring; and it is a  matter for careful enquiry how far the same holds good in Australia,  where the fact of fatherhood is in some cases asserted to be  unrecognised by the natives. In speaking of consanguinity therefore, it  must be made quite clear whether consanguinity according to native ideas  or according to our own ideas is meant.    The customary limitations and extensions of consanguinity, on the other  hand, cause more inconvenience. They are of course sometimes combined  with the other kind, which we may term quasi-physiological, but with  this combination we need not deal, as we are concerned to analyse only  on broad lines the nature of these elements. Just as, with us, kinship  and consanguinity largely coincide, so with primitive peoples are the  kinship organisations immense, if one-sided, extensions of blood  relationship, at all events in theory. In many parts of the world a  totem kin traces its descent to a single male or female ancestor; and  even where, as in Australia, this is not the case, blood brotherhood is  expressly asserted of the totem kin[3].    Entry into the totem kin may often be gained by adoption, though not  apparently in Australia, and the blood relationship thus becomes an  artificial one and partakes, even if the initial assumption be accepted  as true, far more of the nature of kinship than of consanguinity. In  Australia, and possibly in other parts of the world, there is a further  extension of natal kinship. Although the tribe is not regarded as  descended from a single pair, its members are certainly reckoned as of  kin to each other in some way; the situation may be summarised by saying  that under one of the systems of kinship organisation (the two-phratry),  half of the members of the tribe in a given generation are related to a  given man, A, and the other half to his wife. More than one observer  assures us that there is a solidarity about the tribe, which regards  some, if not all other tribes as \"wild blacks,\" though it may be on  terms of friendship and alliance with certain neighbours, and feel  itself united to them by a bond analogous to, though weaker than, that  which holds its own members together.    If however a homonymous totem kin exists even in a hostile or absolutely  unknown tribe, a member of it will be regarded, as we learn from Dr  Howitt, as a brother. How this view is reconciled with the belief that  the tribe in question is alien and in no way akin to that in which the  other totem kin is found, is a question of some interest for which there  appears to be no answer in the literature concerning the Australian  aborigines.    Even if, therefore, we had reason to believe that all totem kins in a  given tribe or group of tribes could make out a good case for their  descent from single male or female ancestors, which is far from being  the case, we should still have to recognise that kinship and not  consanguinity is the proper term to apply to the relationship between  members of the same group. For, as we have seen, it may be recruited  from without in some cases, while in others, persons who are  demonstrably not of the same blood, are regarded as totem-brethren by  virtue of the common name.    Enough has now been said to make clear the difference between  consanguinity and kinship and to exemplify the nature of some of the  transitional forms. As we have seen, it is on considerations of either  consanguinity or kinship that many marriage prohibitions are based.    Marriage prohibitions depend broadly on three kinds of considerations:  (1) Kinship, intermarriage being forbidden to members of the same  kinship group; a brief introductory sketch of the nature and  distribution of kinship groups will be found below. (2) Locality. In New  Guinea, parts of Australia, Melanesia, Africa, and possibly elsewhere,  _local exogamy_ is found. By this is meant that the resident in one  place is bound to go outside his own group for a mate, and may perhaps  be bound to seek a spouse in a specified locality. This kind of  organisation is in Australia almost certainly an offshoot of kinship  organisation (see p. 10), and is _prima facie_ due to the same cause in  other areas. (3) (_a_) consanguinity, and (_b_) affinity. The first of  these considerations is regulative of marriage even in Australia, where  the influence of kinship organisations is in the main supreme in these  matters. We learn from Roth and other authorities that blood cousins,  children of own brother and sister, may not marry in North-West Central  Queensland, although the kinship regulations designate them as the  proper spouses one for the other. (_b_) Considerations of affinity, the  relations set up by marriage, do not affect the status of the parties,  so far as the legality of marriage is concerned, till a somewhat higher  stage is reached.    In the present work we are concerned with kinship groups and the  marriage regulations based on them. A kinship group, whether it be a  totem kin, phratry, class, or other form of association, is a fraction  of a tribe; and before we proceed to deal with kinship organisations, it  will be necessary to say a few words on the nature of the tribe and the  family. In Australia the tribe is a local aggregate, composed of  friendly groups speaking the same language and owning corporately or  individually the land to which the tribe lays claim. A change of tribe  is effected by marriage plus removal, and possibly by simple residence;  children belong to the tribe among which their parents reside. In the  ordinary tribe each member seems to apply to every other member one or  other of the kinship terms; and this no doubt accounts for the feeling  of tribal solidarity already mentioned. There are however certain "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#3)"],[1,"s, that is to say, which in  actual life would furnish the most powerful stimulus to the tactile  imagination. Obliged to get the utmost out of his rudimentary light and  shade, he makes his scheme of colour of the lightest that his contrasts  may be of the strongest. In his compositions, he aims at clearness of  grouping, so that each important figure may have its desired tactile  value. Note in the \"Madonna\" we have been looking at, how the shadows  compel us to realise every concavity, and the lights every convexity,  and how, with the play of the two, under the guidance of line, we  realise the significant parts of each figure, whether draped or  undraped. Nothing here but has its architectonic reason. Above all,  every line is functional; that is to say, charged with purpose. Its  existence, its direction, is absolutely determined by the need of  rendering the tactile values. Follow any line here, say in the figure of  the angel kneeling to the left, and see how it outlines and models, how  it enables you to realise the head, the torso, the hips, the legs, the  feet, and how its direction, its tension, is always determined by the  action. There is not a genuine fragment of Giotto in existence but has  these qualities, and to such a degree that the worst treatment has not  been able to spoil them. Witness the resurrected frescoes in Santa Croce  at Florence!    [Page heading: SYMBOLISM OF GIOTTO]    The rendering of tactile values once recognised as the most important  specifically artistic quality of Giotto's work, and as his personal  contribution to the art of painting, we are all the better fitted to  appreciate his more obvious though less peculiar merits--merits, I must  add, which would seem far less extraordinary if it were not for the high  plane of reality on which Giotto keeps us. Now what is back of this  power of raising us to a higher plane of reality but a genius for  grasping and communicating real significance? What is it to render the  tactile values of an object but to communicate its material  significance? A painter who, after generations of mere manufacturers of  symbols, illustrations, and allegories had the power to render the  material significance of the objects he painted, must, as a man, have  had a profound sense of the significant. No matter, then, what his  theme, Giotto feels its real significance and communicates as much of it  as the general limitations of his art, and of his own skill permit. When  the theme is sacred story, it is scarcely necessary to point out with  what processional gravity, with what hieratic dignity, with what  sacramental intentness he endows it; the eloquence of the greatest  critics has here found a darling subject. But let us look a moment at  certain of his symbols in the Arena at Padua, at the \"Inconstancy,\" the  \"Injustice,\" the \"Avarice,\" for instance. \"What are the significant  traits,\" he seems to have asked himself, \"in the appearance and action  of a person under the exclusive domination of one of these vices? Let me  paint the person with these traits, and I shall have a figure that  perforce must call up the vice in question.\" So he paints \"Inconstancy\"  as a woman with a blank face, her arms held out aimlessly, her torso  falling backwards, her feet on the side of a wheel. It makes one giddy  to look at her. \"Injustice,\" is a powerfully built man in the vigour of  his years dressed in the costume of a judge, with his left hand  clenching the hilt of his sword, and his clawed right hand grasping a  double hooked lance. His cruel eye is sternly on the watch, and his  attitude is one of alert readiness to spring in all his giant force upon  his prey. He sits enthroned on a rock, overtowering the tall waving  trees, and below him his underlings are stripping and murdering a  wayfarer. \"Avarice\" is a horned hag with ears like trumpets. A snake  issuing from her mouth curls back and bites her forehead. Her left hand  clutches her money-bag, as she moves forward stealthily, her right hand  ready to shut down on whatever it can grasp. No need to label them: as  long as these vices exist, for so long has Giotto extracted and  presented their visible significance.    [Page heading: GIOTTO]    Still another exemplification of his sense for the significant is  furnished by his treatment of action and movement. The grouping, the  gestures never fail to be just such as will most rapidly convey the  meaning. So with the significant line, the significant light and shade,  the significant look up or down, and the significant gesture, with means  technically of the simplest, and, be it remembered, with no knowledge of  anatomy, Giotto conveys a complete sense of motion such as we get in his  Paduan frescoes of the \"Resurrection of the Blessed,\" of the \"Ascension  of our Lord,\" of the God the Father in the \"Baptism,\" or the angel in  \"Zacharias' Dream.\"    This, then, is Giotto's claim to everlasting appreciation as an artist:  that his thorough-going sense for the significant in the visible world  enabled him so to represent things that we realise his representations  more quickly and more completely than we should realise the things  themselves, thus giving us that confirmation of our sense of capacity  which is so great a source of pleasure.      III.    [Page heading: FOLLOWERS OF GIOTTO]    For a hundred years after Giotto there appeared in Florence no painter  equally endowed with dominion over the significant. His immediate  followers so little understood the essence of his power that some  thought it resided in his massive types, others in the swiftness of his  line, and still others in his light colour, and it never occurred to any  of them that the massive form without its material significance, its  tactile values, is a shapeless sack, that the line which is not  functional is mere calligraphy, and that light colour by itself can at  the best spot a surface prettily. The better of them felt their  inferiority, but knew no remedy, and all worked busily, copying and  distorting Giotto, until they and the public were heartily tired. A  change at all costs became necessary, and it was very simple when it  came. \"Why grope about for the significant, when the obvious is at hand?  Let me paint the obvious; the obvious always pleases,\" said some clever  innovator. So he painted the obvious,--pretty clothes, pretty faces, and  trivial action, with the results foreseen: he pleased then, and he  pleases still. Crowds still flock to the Spanish chapel in S. Maria  Novella to celebrate the triumph of the obvious, and non-significant.  Pretty faces, pretty colour, pretty clothes, and trivial action! Is  there a single figure in the fresco representing the \"Triumph of St.  Thomas\" which incarnates the idea it symbolises, which, without its  labelling instrument, would convey any meaning whatever? One pretty  woman holds a globe and sword, and I am required to feel the majesty of  empire; another has painted over her pretty clothes a bow and arrow,  which are supposed to rouse me to a sense of the terrors of war; a third  has an organ on what was intended to be her knee, and the sight of this  instrument must suffice to put me into the ecstasies of heavenly music;  still another pretty lady has her arm akimbo, and if you want to know  what edification she can bring, you must read her scroll. Below these  pretty women sit a number of men looking as worthy as clothes and beards  can make them; one highly dignified old gentleman gazes with all his  heart and all his soul at--the point of his quill. The same lack of  significance, the same obviousness characterise the fresco representing  the \"Church Militant and Triumphant.\" What more obvious symbol for _the_  Church than _a_ church? what more significant of St. Dominic than the  refuted Paynim philosopher who (with a movement, by the way, as obvious  as it is clever) tears out a leaf from his own book? And I have touched  only on the value of these frescoes as allegories. Not to speak of the  emptiness of the one and the confusion of the other, as compositions,  there is not a figure in either which has tactile values,--that is to  say, artistic existence.    While I do not mean to imply that painting between Giotto and Masaccio  existed in vain--on the contrary, considerable progress was made in the  direction of landscape, perspective, and facial expression,--it is true  that, excepting the works of two men, no masterpieces of art were  produced. These two, one coming in the middle of the period we have been  dwelling upon, and the other just at its close, were Andrea Orcagna and  Fra Angelico.    [Page heading: ORCAGNA]    Of Orcagna it is difficult to speak, as only a single fairly intact  painting of his remains, the altar-piece in S. Maria Novella. Here he  reveals himself as a man of considerable endowment: as in Giotto, we  have tactile values, material significance; the figures artistically  exist. But while this painting betrays no peculiar feeling for beauty of  face and expression, the frescoes in the same chapel, the one in  particular representing Paradise, have faces full of charm and grace. I  am tempted to believe that we have here a happy improvement made by the  recent restorer. But what these mural paintings must always have had is  real artistic existence, great dignity of slow but rhythmic movement,  and splendid grouping. They still convince us of their high purpose. On  the other hand, we are disappointed in Orcagna's sculptured tabernacle  at Or Sammichele, where the feeling for both material and spiritual  significance is much lower.    [Page heading: FRA ANGELICO]    We are happily far better situated toward Fra Angelico, enough of whose  works have come down to us to reveal not only his quality as an artist,  but his character as a man. Perfect certainty of purpose, utter devotion  to his task, a sacramental earnestness in performing it, are what the  quantity and quality of his"]]]
