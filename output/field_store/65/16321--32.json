One fine morning, his mother told James to make haste  home from school, for she wished, after he had come back,  to take him to his aunt's.  5. But, instead of minding her, he went off to the water,  where there were some boats. There he met plenty of idle  boys.  6. Some of these boys found that James     28  ECLECTIC SERIES,  had money, which his aunt had given him; and he was led by  them to hire a boat, and to go with them upon the water.  7. Little did James think of the danger into which he was  running. Soon the wind began to blow, and none of them  knew how to manage the boat.    8. For some time, they struggled against the wind and the  tide. At last, they became so tired that they could row no  longer.  9. A large wave upset the boat, and they were all thrown  into the water. Think of James Brown, the truant, at this  time!  10. He was far from home, known by no one. His parents  were ignorant of his danger.     THIRD READER.  29  He was struggling in the water, on the point of being  drowned.  11. Some men, however, saw the boys, and went out to  them in a boat. They reached them just in time to save them  from a watery grave.  12. They were taken into a house, where their clothes  were dried. After a while, they were sent home to their  parents.  13. James was very sorry for his conduct, and he was  never known to be guilty of the same thing again.  14. He became regular at school, learned to attend to his  books, and, above all, to obey his parents perfectly.    LESSON VIII.        THE WHITE KITTEN.    1.  My little white kitten's asleep on my knee;  As white as the snow or the lilies is she;      She wakes up with a pur      When I stroke her soft fur:  Was there ever another white kitten like her?     30  ECLECTIC SERIES.    2.  My little white kitten now wants to go out  And frolic, with no one to watch her about;      \"Little kitten,\" I say,     \"Just an hour you may stay,  And be careful in choosing your places to play.\"        3. But night has come down, when I hear a loud \"mew;\"  I open the door, and my kitten comes through;      My white kitten! ah me!      Can it really be she--  This ill-looking, beggar-like cat that I see?    4. What ugly, gray streaks on her side and her back!  Her nose, once as pink as a rosebud, is black!      Oh, I very well know,      Though she does not say so,  She has been where white kittens ought never to go.      THIRD READER.  31    5. If little good children intend to do right,  If little white kittens would keep themselves white,      It is needful that they      Should this counsel obey,  And be careful in choosing their places to play.    LESSON IX.      THE BEAVER.    1. The beaver is found chiefly in North America. It is  about three and a half feet long, including the flat, paddle-  shaped tail, which is a foot in length.  2. The long, shining hair on the back is chestnut-colored,  while the fine, soft fur that lies next the skin, is grayish  brown.  3. Beavers build themselves most curious huts to live in,  and quite frequently a great number of these huts are placed  close together, like the buildings in a town.  4. They always build their huts on the banks of rivers or  lakes, for they swim much     32  ECLECTIC SERIES.  more easily than they walk, and prefer moving about in the  water.  5. When they build on the bank of a running stream, they  make a dam across the stream for the purpose of keeping the  water at the height they wish.  6. These dams are made chiefly of mud, and stones, and  the branches of trees. They are sometimes six or seven  hundred feet in length, and are so constructed that they look  more like the work of man than of little dumb beasts.  7. Their huts are made of the same material as the dams,  and are round in shape. The walls are very thick, and the  roofs are finished off with a thick layer of mud, sticks, and  leaves.  8. They commence building their houses late in the  summer, but do not get them finished before the early frosts.  The freezing makes them tighter and stronger.  9. They obtain the wood for their dams and huts by  gnawing through the branches of trees, and even through the  trunks of small ones, with their sharp front teeth. They peel  off the bark, and lay it up in store for winter food.     THIRD READER.  33  10. The fur of the beaver is highly prized. The men who  hunt these animals are called trappers.  11. A gentleman once saw five young beavers playing.  They would leap on the trunk of a tree that lay near a beaver  dam, and would push one another off into the water.    12. He crept forward very cautiously, and was about to  fire on the little creatures; but their amusing tricks reminded  him so much of some little children he knew at home, that he  thought it would be inhuman to kill them. So he left them  without even disturbing their play.    3,3     34  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON X.        THE YOUNG TEACHER.    1. Charles Rose lived in the country with his father, who  taught him to read and to write.  2. Mr. Rose told his son that, when his morning lessons  were over, he might amuse himself for one hour as he  pleased.  3. There was a river near by. On its bank stood the hut of a  poor fisherman, who lived by selling fish.  4. His careful wife kept her wheel going early and late.  They both worked very hard to keep themselves above want.  5. But they were greatly troubled lest their only son  should never learn to read and to write. They could not teach  him themselves, and they were too poor to send him to  school.  6. Charles called at the hut of this fisherman one day, to  inquire about his dog, which was missing.      THIRD READER.  35  7. He found the little boy, whose name was Joe, sitting by  the table, on which he was making marks with a piece of  chalk. Charles asked him whether he was drawing pictures.    8. \"No, I am trying to write,\" said little Joe, \"but I know  only two words. Those I saw upon a sign, and I am trying to  write them.\"  9. \"If I could only learn to read and write,\" said he, \"I  should be the happiest boy in the world.\"     36  ECLECTIC SERIES.  10. \"Then I will make you happy,\" said Charles. \"I am  only a little boy, but I can teach you that.  11. \"My father gives me an hour every day for myself.  Now, if you will try to learn, you shall soon know how to  read and to write.\"  12. Both Joe and his mother were ready to fall on their  knees to thank Charles. They told him it was what they  wished above all things.  13. So, on the next day when the hour came, Charles put  his book in his pocket, and went to teach Joe. Joe learned  very fast, and Charles soon began to teach him how to write.  14. Some time after, a gentleman called on Mr. Rose, and  asked him if he knew where Charles was. Mr. Rose said that  he was taking a walk, he supposed.  15. \"I am afraid,\" said the gentleman, \"that he does not  always amuse himself thus. I often see him go to the house  of the fisherman. I fear he goes out in their boat.\"  16. Mr. Rose was much troubled. He had told Charles that  he must never venture on the river, and he thought he could  trust him.      THIRD READER.  37  17. The moment the gentleman left, Mr. Rose went in  search of his son. He went to the river, and walked up and  down, in hope of seeing the boat.  18. Not seeing it, he grew uneasy. He thought Charles  must have gone a long way off. Unwilling to leave without  learning something of him, he went to the hut.  19. He put his head in at the window, which was open.  There a pleasant sight met his eyes.  20. Charles was at the table, ruling a copybook Joe was  reading to him, while his mother was spinning in the corner.  21. Charles was a little confused. He feared his father  might not be pleased; but he had no need to be uneasy, for  his father was delighted.  22. The next day, his father took him to town, and gave  him books for himself and Joe, with writing paper, pens, and  ink.  23. Charles was the happiest boy in the world when he  came home. He ran to Joe, his hands filled with parcels, and  his heart beating with joy.     38  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON XI.        THE BLACKSMITH.    1. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!  We begin to hammer at morning's blink,  And hammer away  Till the busy day,  Like us, aweary, to rest shall sink.    2. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!  From labor and care we never will shrink;  But our fires we'll blow  Till our forges glow  With light intense, while our eyelids wink.      THIRD READER.  39    3. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink;  The chain we'll forge with many a link.  We'll work each form  While the iron is warm,  With strokes as fast as we can think.    4. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!  Our faces may be as black as ink,  But our hearts are true  As man ever knew,  And kindly of all we shall ever think.    LESSON XII.        A WALK IN THE GARDEN.    1. Frank was one day walking with his mother, when they  came to a pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had  clean gravel walks, and beds of beautiful flowers all in  bloom.  2. He called to his mother, and said, \"Mother, come and  look at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and  walk in.\"     40  ECLECTIC SERIES.  3. The gardener, being near, heard what Frank said, and  kindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden.  4. Frank's mother thanked the man. Turning to her son,  she said, \"Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you  must take care not to meddle with anything in it.\"    5. Frank walked along the neat gravel paths, and looked at  everything, but touched nothing that he saw.  6. He did not tread on any of the borders, and was careful  that his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers, lest  he might break them.      THIRD READER.  41  7. The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he  was so careful not to do mischief. He showed him the seeds,  and told him the name of many of the flowers and plants.  8. While Frank was admiring the beauty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14772"],[0,"Acton's Feud: A Public School Story (#3)"],[1,"shall make no row  about it; and, since you can dole out the caps to your own pet chums, and  no one can stop you--do it! but I think you'll regret it all the same. I'm  not going to moan about it--that isn't my way; but I really think you'll  regret it. That is all; though\"--this with a mocking sneer--\"why it  requires two of you to come and insult a man in his own room I don't  understand.\"    \"I came to say that if you'd apologize to Aspinall things might  straighten.\"    \"Might straighten! Oh, thanks!\" he said, his face looking beastly  venomous. \"I think you'd better go, really.\"    So we went, and I could not but feel that Bourne was right when he said on  parting, \"Our friend will make himself superbly disagreeable over this,  take my word for it! But he won't get into the eleven, and I won't have a  soul know that old Aspinall's scar is the work of a fellow in St. Amory's,  either. If they have to know, he must tell them himself.\"          CHAPTER III    THE REGENERATION OF BIFFEN'S HOUSE      To say that Acton was upset by our visit and our conversation and Bourne's  ultimatum would be beside the mark; he was furious, and when he had cooled  down somewhat, his anger settled into a long, steady stretch of hate  towards us both, but especially towards Bourne. He simmered over many  plans for getting \"even\" with him, and when he had finally mapped out a  course he proceeded, as some one says, \"diligently to ensue it;\" for Acton  was not of that kind to be \"awkward\" as occasion arose, but there was  method in all his schemes.    It so happened that Worcester was captain of Biffen's house, and also of  Biffen's \"footer\" team. My own opinion was that poor old Worcester would  have given a lot to be out of such a house as Biffen's, and I know he  utterly despised himself for having in a moment of inexplicable weakness  consented to be permanent lead to Biffen's awful crowd on the Acres. He  died a thousand deaths after each (usual) annihilation. Worcester and  Acton had nothing in common, and, except that they were in the same house  and form, they would not probably have come to nodding terms. Worcester,  of course, looked up to the magnificent \"footer\" player as the average  player looks up to the superlative. After the first game of the season,  when Acton had turned out in all his glory, Dick had thereupon offered to  resign his captaincy, even pressing, with perhaps suspicious eagerness,  Acton's acceptance of that barren honour. But Acton did not bite. Captains  were supposed to turn out pretty well every day with their strings, and  Acton was not the sort of fellow to have his hands tied in any way. So he  had gently declined.    \"No, old man. Wouldn't dream of ousting you. You'll get a good team out of  Biffen's yet. Plenty of raw material.\"    \"That's just it,\" said Worcester, naively; \"it is so jolly raw.\"    \"Well, cook it, old man.\"    \"It only makes hash,\" said Worcester, with a forlorn smile at his own  joke.    But now Acton thought that the captaincy of Biffen's might dovetail into  his schemes for the upsetting of Bourne, and therefore Dick's proposal was  to be reconsidered. Thus it was that Worcester got a note from Acton  asking him to breakfast.    Worcester came, and his eyes visibly brightened when he spotted Acton's  table, for there was more than a little style about Acton's catering, and  Worcester had a weakness for the square meal. Acton's fag, Grim, was busy  with the kettle, and there was as reinforcement in Dick's special honour,  young Poulett, St. Amory's champion egg-poacher, sustaining his big  reputation in a large saucepan. Worcester sank into his chair with a sigh  of satisfaction at sight of little Poulett; he was to be in clover,  evidently.    \"That's right, Worcester. That _is_ the easiest chair. Got that last  egg on the toast, Poulett? You're a treasure, and so I'll write your  mamma. Tea or coffee, Dick? Coffee for Worcester, Grim, tea for me. Pass  that cream to Worcester, and you've forgotten the knife for the pie.  You're a credit to Sharpe's, Poulett; but remember that you've been  poaching for Biffen's footer captain. That's something, anyhow. Don't  grin, Poulett; it's bad form. Going? To Bourne's, eh? I can recommend you,  though it would be no recommendation to him. You can cut, too, Grim, and  clear at 9.30. See the door catches.\"    Grim scuttled after the renowned egg-poacher, and Worcester and Acton were  left alone. When Worcester was fed, and had pushed back his chair, Acton  broached the business to which the breakfast was the preliminary.    \"Fact is, Worcester, I've been thinking how it is that Biffen's is the  slackest house in the place.\"    \"Oh! it's got such a plucky reputation, you know. The kids weep when  they're put down for Biffen's. Give a dog a bad name--\"    \"But why the bad name?\"    \"Dunno! Perhaps it's Biffen. I think so, anyhow. At any rate, there's not  been a fellow from the house in the Lord's eleven or in the footer eleven,  and in the schools Biffen's crowd always close the rear. By the way, how  did you come among our rout?\"    \"I think mater knew Biffen; that's the explanation.\"    \"Rather rough on you.\"    \"Don't feel anything, really, Worcester.\"    \"Well, Biffen has got a diabolical knack of picking up all the loose ends  of the school; all the impossible fellows gravitate here: why, look at our  Dervishes!\" (Dervish was the slang for foreigners at St. Amory's.)    \"We've certainly got more than our share of colour.\"    \"That's Biffen's all the world over,\" said Dick, with intense heat; \"you  could match any colour between an interesting orange and a real jet black  among our collection. Biffen simply can't resist a nigger. He must have  him. What they come to the place at all for licks me. Can't the  missionaries teach 'em to spell?\"    \"_La haute politique_,\" suggested Acton.    \"Of Sarawack or Timbuctoo?\" said Worcester, with scorn. \"Bet my boots that  Borneo one's governor went head-hunting in his time, and the darkest  African one's knows what roasted man is.\"    Acton laughed, for a nigger was to Worcester as a red rag to a bull. \"St.  Amory's for niggers!\" Dick would say with intense scorn.    \"Anyhow,\" said Acton, \"I think there's no need for us to be quite so  slack.\"    \"You'll pull us up a bit?\" said Dick, with genuine admiration.    \"Thanks. But I meant the whole house generally.\"    \"Not much good. We're Biffen's, that never did nor never shall, etc.\"    \"I don't know. There's sixty of us, barring your niggers; we ought to get  eleven to look at a football with a business eye out of that lot, you  know.\"    \"We ought to, but don't.\"    \"We ought to do something in the schools too.\"    \"We ought to, but don't, though Raven is in for the Perry Exhibition.  Guess he won't pull it off, though.\"    \"We'll see about that, too,\" said Acton. \"As for the niggers--\"    \"Oh, never mind them!\" burst in Worcester. \"Without humbug, Acton, do you  really want our house to move a bit?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"Well, then, consent to captain our footer eleven and we give ourselves a  chance, for I can't make the fellows raise a gallop at any price, and I  somehow think you can. Have a try. If you are sick of it at Christmas,  I'll come in again; honour bright. It isn't too good-natured of me to ask  you to pull Biffen's out of the mud, but you're the only fellow to do it  if it can be done. Will you?\"    \"You wouldn't mind resigning?\"    \"By Jove, no!\" said Worcester, precipitately.    \"Don't mention it. Not at all, old man, not at all.\"    \"Well, I've been thinking that, if you didn't mind, I'd like to try my  hand on our crowd; though, since you don't move 'em, there can't be much  chance for me to do anything smart.\"    \"That doesn't follow, for you aren't me, old man.\"    \"Then I'll have a shot at it.\"    Worcester grasped Acton's hand, as the French say, \"with emotion.\"    \"But the house will have to elect me, you know; perhaps they'd fancy Raven  as captain. He can play decently, and they know him.\"    \"Well, Biffen's are a dense lot, but I'm hanged if even their stupidity  would do a thing like that. They've seen you play, haven't they?\"    \"Thanks. Fact is, Dick, I feel a bit bored by the patronage of Taylor's  and Merishall's, and Sharpe's and Corker's, and all the rest of the  houses.\"    \"Oh! Biffen's laid himself out for that, you must see.\"    \"I don't fancy Bourne's sneers and Hodgson's high stilts.\"    \"Haven't noticed either,\" said Dick.    \"H'm!\" said Acton, rather nettled by Dick's dry tone. \"I have. As for the  niggers--\"    \"The other houses despise us on their account. We're the Dervish Camp to  the rest.\"    \"As for the niggers, they shall do something for Biffen's too,\" said  Acton, rather thoughtfully.    \"You mean in the sing-songs? Well, they'll spare the burnt cork  certainly.\"    \"Well, that's an idea too,\" said Acton, laughing, \"but not the one I had.  That will keep.\"    Worcester might have some curiosity to know what Acton's idea was, but he  wasn't going to inquire anything about the niggers.    \"It's awfully brickish of you, Worcester,\" said Acton, as Grim was heard  trotting up the corridor \"to stand down.\"    \"Not at all; the sacrifice is on your altar.\"    \"Then _allons_. Here's Grim knocking, and I've to see Corker at 9.40.  You'll excuse me.\"    Grim came in and commenced to clear away, and the two sallied out.          CHAPTER IV    BIFFEN'S PROGRESS      That day, after morning school, Biffen's held a meeting, and thereat Acton  was proposed captain by Worcester and seconded by Raven; and Biffen's  confirmed Worcester's qualified opinion of their sense by electing him  _nem. con_.    From that day Acton threw his heart and soul into the regeneration of  Biffen's. There did not pass an afternoon but that he turned out for  footer, and coached, encouraged, bullied, stormed, praised each individual  member of the team with the strictest impartiality and Spartan justice.
