He  also advised Pharaoh to lay up corn in cities during the years of  plenty, so that the people might be fed during the years of famine.  Pharaoh saw what great wisdom God had given Joseph, and made him ruler  over all the land of Egypt. The corn was stored up; and after the  years of plenty the famine came.    [Illustration: JOSEPH BEFORE THE PHARAOH.]    During all this time Jacob and his sons had been dwelling in Canaan;  where, through the famine, they were now in want of food. So Jacob  sent his sons to Egypt to buy corn. The Bible tells us, in the book of  Genesis, how they came to Egypt, and all that befell them there; and  how at last Joseph, the ruler of the mighty kingdom, made himself  known to them as the brother they had cruelly sold for a slave. But he  forgave them, and sent to fetch his father Jacob, saying that all were  to come into Egypt, where he would provide for them.    Jacob could not at first believe the good news his sons brought; but  when he saw the waggons which Joseph had sent to carry him and the  little ones, he said, \"It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive; I  will go and see him before I die.\" So he journeyed to Egypt, with his  sons, and all that he had; and as he drew near Joseph went to meet  him. When Joseph met his father, he fell on his neck, and wept there.  And Jacob said, \"Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because  thou art yet alive.\" He was so full of joy that it seemed to him there  was nothing else worth living for. Afterwards Joseph presented his  father to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh; who allowed him and his  family to dwell in the land of Goshen.    [Illustration: JACOB PRESENTED TO PHARAOH.]          THE FINDING OF MOSES.      Pharoah, becoming alarmed at the increasing power and numbers of the  Israelites in Egypt, ordered that every male child who might be born  to them should be cast into the river, and drowned. But the wife of a  man named Levi felt that she could not give up her babe, and for three  months she hid him. When she could hide him no longer, she prepared a  basket of rushes, and coated it with pitch, so that it would float  upon the river and keep out the water. In this ark she placed her  infant son, and hid the ark among the flags and bulrushes on the  river-bank, and set the child's sister to watch it.    Now it happened that the daughter of Pharaoh came with her maidens to  bathe in the river; and when she saw the basket she sent one of her  maids to fetch it. And when she looked at the child he wept, and she  had compassion for him, and said, \"This is one of the Hebrews'  children.\" Then the child's sister came forward and said to Pharaoh's  daughter, \"Shall I call to thee a Hebrew woman that she may nurse the  child for thee?\" And when the princess said, \"Go!\" she, the maid, went  and called her own mother, to whom Pharaoh's daughter said, \"Take this  child and nurse him for me, and I will give thee thy wages.\" And the  woman took the child and nursed him. And when he had grown, his mother  took him to the princess, who adopted him as her son, and called his  name Moses, which means _drawn out_, because she took him from the  water. Afterwards he grew to be a great man: he was learned in all the  wisdom of the Egyptians; and we are told, \"he was mighty in words and  deeds.\"    [Illustration: THE FINDING OF MOSES.]          THE FLIGHT FROM EGYPT.      When Moses was forty years old he had to flee from Egypt. He went to  Midian, where he dwelt for forty years; at the end of which time God  appeared to him, and instructed him to return to Egypt; where he was  appointed by God to lead the Israelites from bondage to the land of  Canaan. Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and delivered  to him God's command to let the people of Israel go; telling him that  if he disobeyed terrible plagues would come upon his land. Pharaoh  hardened his heart against God, and refused to let the people go; so  ten dreadful plagues were sent, the last of which was that the  firstborn of every Egyptian should die, whether it were man or beast.  But not a single Israelite was to suffer harm. This plague God said  should come in the night; when an angel would pass through the land,  destroying the Egyptians but sparing the Israelites.    Each family of the Israelites was commanded, on the evening that God  had appointed, to kill a lamb, and to dip a bunch of hyssop in its  blood, sprinkling this blood upon the top and side posts of the door.  All the houses thus marked God said would be spared when the  destroying angel passed through the land. In the night, while the  Israelites were, according to God's command, eating the lambs that had  been slain, all ready to depart, a great cry arose among the  Egyptians. In every house, from the palace downwards, the eldest child  lay dead.    Then the Egyptians arose, and thrust the Israelites out; and they left  Egypt, and journeyed towards the Red Sea.    [Illustration: SPRINKLING THE BLOOD.]          MOSES STRIKING THE ROCK.      After the Israelites left Egypt they crossed the Red Sea, whose waters  divided so that they passed through on dry land. Then they travelled  through the wilderness toward Mount Sinai. Passing onward, they wanted  water and food; and forgetting the great things God had already done  for them, they began to murmur. At a place called Marah they found the  water too bitter to drink; so they grumbled, saying to Moses, \"What  shall we drink?\" He asked God; who showed him a tree, which, when cast  into the water, made it sweet.    Next the people murmured for food, and God sent them manna, which they  gathered every day except the Sabbath; but with all God's care and  kindness the Israelites continued to grumble whenever any difficulty  arose. Journeying forward, they entered another wilderness, called the  Desert of Sin, and came to a place named Rephidim, where they found no  water. They were very thirsty, and came to Moses murmuring and saying,  \"Give us water that we may drink.\" How could Moses do that? He was  grieved with them, and said, \"Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye  tempt the Lord?\" But the people grew so angry that they were ready to  stone him. Then Moses told God all the trouble, and God showed him  what to do. He was to go before the people, taking the elders of  Israel with him, and his rod, and God would stand before him on a rock  among the mountains of Horeb. This rock he was to strike, when water  would gush forth.    Moses did as God commanded. He went forward with the elders, struck  the rock with his rod; and the pure, clear water gushed out, so that  all the people were able to drink.    [Illustration: STRIKING THE ROCK.]          THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.      The Israelites journeyed onward and encamped before Mount Sinai. There  God talked with Moses, and instructed him to remind the people of the  great things He had done for them; and to say that if they obeyed Him,  and kept His covenant, they should be a peculiar treasure to Him above  all people, and a holy nation.    When the people heard God's message, they answered, \"All that the Lord  hath spoken we will do.\" How happy would they have been if they had  always kept this promise! But, alas! they did not do so; and great  punishments came upon them in consequence.    God also said that on the third day He would descend upon Mount Sinai;  and commanded the people to prepare themselves for that great and  solemn event. None were to approach the mount, for if they did so they  would die. On the third day, according to the command, the people  gathered before Mount Sinai. A thick cloud covered the mountain, which  smoked and quaked, and there were thunders and lightnings; a trumpet  also sounded exceeding loud, so that all the people trembled. Then God  spake from the midst of the fire, and gave the people the Ten  Commandments. These you will find in the twentieth chapter of Exodus;  and little folks with sharp eyes can read them in our picture.    We are told that \"all the people saw the thunderings, and the  lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking;\"  and when they saw it they were so much afraid that they stood afar  off. How holy is God's law, and how careful should we be to obey it!    [Illustration: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.]          BEZALEEL AND AHOLIAB.      After God had given the Ten Commandments, He called Moses up into the  mountain; where he remained forty days and forty nights. During that  time, God told him to speak to the Israelites, asking them to give  gold, silver, brass, blue, purple, fine linen, oil, precious stones,  and other things, to make a tabernacle or sanctuary, where God would  dwell among them. God showed Moses the pattern of this tabernacle,  with its coverings, its holy place and most holy place, its ark of the  covenant with the cherubims and mercy-seat, its table for the  shewbread, golden candlestick, and altar of incense, and the garments  for Aaron and his sons, etc.; everything was accurately described by  God. Then God instructed Moses as to who could do the work He had  commanded to be done, and named two to whom He had given special  wisdom and skill: these two were Bezaleel and Aholiab.    When Moses came down from the mountain he called Aaron and all the  people of Israel, and told them what God had commanded. The people  willingly brought gifts, till more than enough was provided. Then  Bezaleel and Aholiab, and other wise-hearted men, worked diligently  until the tabernacle and all things belonging to it were made exactly  as God had instructed. Some worked in gold and silver, others in brass  and wood; wise women spun "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#3)"],[1," as he sowed some fell by the  wayside and was trodden down, and birds came and devoured it. And some  fell upon a rocky place, where there was not much soil, and as soon as  it sprang up it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some  fell among thorns and weeds, and they sprang up with it and choked it.  But other fell on good ground, and sprang up bearing ears, some with  thirty, some sixty, some a hundred seeds.    When Jesus had told this parable, His disciples asked Him to explain  it to them. He said that the seed is the Word of God. The wayside  signifies the people who hear the Word but do not understand it, and  Satan comes and takes all thought of it out of their hearts as quickly  as the birds devour the seeds. The rocky places without much earth  denote those who, when they hear the Word, receive it with great joy  and profession of faith; but it never takes deep root in their hearts,  and when they are tempted they fall away and the good seed in their  hearts is withered up. The thorns and weeds are the pleasures and  riches of this life, which root so deeply and strongly in men's hearts  that the good seed has no chance, and is soon killed off.    But the good ground is the hearts of good people, who remember God's  Word and try, every day of their lives, to do as He wishes us to do,  and to live holy and useful lives. The seed falling upon their hearts  becomes strongly rooted and grows up vigorously, bearing good fruit.    What shall be said of _your_ heart, my young friend? Is it like the  wayside? the rocky place? the thorny ground? or like a good field that  has been well prepared for the seed?    [Illustration: SOWING THE SEED.]          THE ENEMY SOWING TARES.      A certain man sowed good seed in his field, but in the night, whilst  men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went  his way. When the wheat-blade had sprung up and showed the ear, then  appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came to  him and said, \"Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence  then come these tares?\"    He said unto them, \"An enemy hath done this.\" Then the servants asked,  \"Shall we go, then, and gather them up?\" But he said, \"Nay, lest  whilst you gather up the tares, you root up the wheat with them. Let  both grow together until the harvest, and in that time I will say to  the reapers, 'Gather ye together first the tares and bind them into  bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.'\"    Jesus' disciples asked Him to explain this parable to them, and He  said: \"The field represents the world, and He that sowed the good seed  is Christ Himself. The good seed is the Word He preached; the wheat  plants are the good people who believe in Christ and do as He teaches.  The enemy who sows the bad seed is Satan, and the tares that spring  from them are wicked people who follow the promptings of the evil one  in their hearts. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers  are the angels of God. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned  in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this world with wicked  people. Christ shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out  of His Kingdom all things that offend and them that do evil, and shall  cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing  of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the  kingdom of their Father.\"        \"For the Lord our God shall come,      And shall take His harvest home;      From His field shall in that day      All offences purge away;        \"Give His angels charge at last      In the fire the tares to cast,      But the fruitful grain to store      In His garner evermore.\"    [Illustration: THE ENEMY SOWING TARES.]          THE PARABLE OF THE LEAVEN.      Christ said that the kingdom of heaven could be likened unto leaven  (or yeast), which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour,  till the whole was leavened.    Now, this leaven, or yeast, is composed of tiny little plants, each  one so small that it cannot possibly be seen by the sharpest eye  except through a very powerful microscope. So small are they that it  would require three thousand of them, placed close together, side by  side, to make up the length of one inch. Like all other plants they  require food, and they find this in the dough they are placed in. You  know that all things are made up of atoms of chemical substances so  wonderfully blended together that only the chemist can separate them,  and when he has separated them they appear very different. Well, in  flour there are certain things so blended, and the yeast-plant takes  one kind of substance as food, and in doing so sets free another  substance called carbonic acid gas. This gas bubbles up and makes the  heavy dough spongy and light. If it were not for these tiny bubbles of  gas your bread would be as heavy and close as suet pudding. This is  the reason why yeast is put into dough for making bread or cake. One  of the most remarkable things about this yeast is, that when it gets  into any substance that contains its food, it at once begins to give  off buds, which, in a few moments, become full-sized and break away.  So rapid is this increase, that if a single yeast-plant were to be put  into a great mass of dough it would very quickly leaven the whole  mass.    And so it is with the love of God. When once it gets into our hearts  it will keep on growing until all our life is filled with it, and we  try in all things to please Him.    [Illustration: THE PARABLE OF THE LEAVEN.]          SEEKING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE.      The people of Canaan, both in ancient and modern days, have made a  practice of hiding their treasures. This they have done to secure them  in times of danger. When invaders flocked into the land, the people  buried their gold and jewels, and fled. And often they died, or were  overtaken by their enemies and killed, so that they were unable to  return and regain their buried riches. Earthquakes also have taken  place, destroying towns and villages, and burying all the riches in  them beneath their ruins. Thus there is much hidden treasure in  Canaan, and numbers of the inhabitants spend their time seeking  diligently and anxiously for it.    Our artist shows us a man who is thus seeking. He has heard that in  old times a great treasure was hidden in a particular field. So he  digs away patiently in various places until, at last, he finds out  that what he heard is quite true. He is sure the treasure is _there_;  and his desire is to become possessed of the field, so that he may  obtain the buried riches. He is willing to sell all that he has if by  so doing he may buy that field. So he hastens home, and gathers  together the whole of his property and sells it. Then he takes his  money to the man who has the land for sale, and buys the field of him.  Thus he becomes possessed of the treasure he has sought after. Jesus  says that the Kingdom of Heaven is like that treasure. It is so  precious, that when a man finds out its value, and knows how it can be  obtained, he will be willing to give up everything he has for it--all  his companions, pleasures, sins, riches--indeed everything he  possesses, in order to gain this great treasure.    [Illustration: THE TREASURE HID IN A FIELD.]          THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE.      Very similar to the parable of the Hidden Treasure is this one of the  merchant seeking goodly pearls.    \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly  pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold  all that he had, and bought it.\"    In the picture we see the merchant on the sea-shore, where he has  waited for the landing of these sailors from another country. He asks  them if they have any goodly pearls for sale, and one man opens his  box and takes out this \"pearl of great price.\" It is just the kind of  pearl the merchant had been seeking, so he quickly produces his two  bags of gold and offers them to the man for his pearl. But the man  smiles. \"What! part with so large and so beautiful a pearl for two  bags of gold?\" He could not think of it. The pearl is again placed in  its box, and the merchant has to go away disappointed. But the longing  to have that pearl is too great. A thought occurs to him. He will go  home and sell all that is his, and the money he shall thus obtain,  added to his two bags of gold, will surely buy the precious jewel.    And so it is with men when they seek that pearl of pearls, the  forgiveness of God. They will give up a great deal in order to obtain  it, but they find that God requires them to give up everything that is  sinful or worldly. And if their hearts are really set upon obtaining  it, they will do as this merchant did, and part with everything that  would hinder them from coming to God, or walking in the way that leads  to heaven.    [Illustration: THE MERCHANT SEEKING GOODLY PEARLS.]          THE PARABLE OF THE NET.      These fishermen have just returned to shore with their net full of  fish. Now this is not a casting-net, which is thrown out from the boat  and drawn in again, but a drag-net which is of great length, and which  is drawn constantly through the water until it is well filled with  fish. It is then hauled up to the shore, and the fishermen sit around  it, and take out the fish. Many of these, of course, are unfit for  food, or not liked. They cast those into the sea again, but the good  fish which they can sell for food are carefully placed in vessels  brought for the purpose.    Christ said, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast  into the sea, and gathered every kind (of fish): which, when it was  full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into  vessels, but cast the bad away. So shall it be at the end of the  world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among  the just, and cast them into the"]]]
