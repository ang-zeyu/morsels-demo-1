These different categories of variation generally exist independently of  one another. In the most extreme cases it can regularly be assumed that  the inversion has existed at all times and that the person feels  contented with his peculiar state.    Many authors will hesitate to gather into a unit all the cases  enumerated here and will prefer to emphasize the differences rather than  the common characters of these groups, a view which corresponds with  their preferred judgment of inversions. But no matter what divisions may  be set up, it cannot be overlooked that all transitions are abundantly  met with, so that the formation of a series would seem to impose itself.    *Conception of Inversion.*--The first attention bestowed upon inversion  gave rise to the conception that it was a congenital sign of nervous  degeneration. This harmonized with the fact that doctors first met it  among the nervous, or among persons giving such an impression. There are  two elements which should be considered independently in this  conception: the congenitality, and the degeneration.    *Degeneration.*--This term _degeneration_ is open to the objections  which may be urged against the promiscuous use of this word in general.  It has in fact become customary to designate all morbid manifestations  not of traumatic or infectious origin as degenerative. Indeed, Magnan's  classification of degenerates makes it possible that the highest general  configuration of nervous accomplishment need not exclude the application  of the concept of degeneration. Under the circumstances, it is a  question what use and what new content the judgment of \"degeneration\"  still possesses. It would seem more appropriate not to speak of  degeneration: (1) Where there are not many marked deviations from the  normal; (2) where the capacity for working and living do not in general  appear markedly impaired.[6]    That the inverted are not degenerates in this qualified sense can be  seen from the following facts:    1. The inversion is found among persons who otherwise show no marked  deviation from the normal.    2. It is found also among persons whose capabilities are not disturbed,  who on the contrary are distinguished by especially high intellectual  development and ethical culture.[7]    3. If one disregards the patients of one's own practice and strives to  comprehend a wider field of experience, he will in two directions  encounter facts which will prevent him from assuming inversions as a  degenerative sign.    (_a_) It must be considered that inversion was a frequent manifestation  among the ancient nations at the height of their culture. It was an  institution endowed with important functions. (_b_) It is found to be  unusually prevalent among savages and primitive races, whereas the term  degeneration is generally limited to higher civilization (I. Bloch).  Even among the most civilized nations of Europe, climate and race have a  most powerful influence on the distribution of, and attitude toward,  inversion.[8]    *Innateness.*--Only for the first and most extreme class of inverts, as  can be imagined, has innateness been claimed, and this from their own  assurance that at no time in their life has their sexual impulse  followed a different course. The fact of the existence of two other  classes, especially of the third, is difficult to reconcile with the  assumption of its being congenital. Hence, the propensity of those  holding this view to separate the group of absolute inverts from the  others results in the abandonment of the general conception of  inversion. Accordingly in a number of cases the inversion would be of a  congenital character, while in others it might originate from other  causes.    In contradistinction to this conception is that which assumes inversion  to be an _acquired_ character of the sexual impulse. It is based on the  following facts. (1) In many inverts (even absolute ones) an early  affective sexual impression can be demonstrated, as a result of which  the homosexual inclination developed. (2) In many others outer  influences of a promoting and inhibiting nature can be demonstrated,  which in earlier or later life led to a fixation of the inversion--among  which are exclusive relations with the same sex, companionship in war,  detention in prison, dangers of hetero-sexual intercourse, celibacy,  sexual weakness, etc. (3) Hypnotic suggestion may remove the inversion,  which would be surprising in that of a congenital character.    In view of all this, the existence of congenital inversion can certainly  be questioned. The objection may be made to it that a more accurate  examination of those claimed to be congenitally inverted will probably  show that the direction of the libido was determined by a definite  experience of early childhood, which has not been retained in the  conscious memory of the person, but which can be brought back to memory  by proper influences (Havelock Ellis). According to that author  inversion can be designated only as a frequent variation of the sexual  impulse which may be determined by a number of external circumstances of  life.    The apparent certainty thus reached is, however, overthrown by the  retort that manifestly there are many persons who have experienced even  in their early youth those very sexual influences, such as seduction,  mutual onanism, without becoming inverts, or without constantly  remaining so. Hence, one is forced to assume that the alternatives  congenital and acquired are either incomplete or do not cover the  circumstances present in inversions.    *Explanation of Inversion.*--The nature of inversion is explained  neither by the assumption that it is congenital nor that it is acquired.  In the first case, we need to be told what there is in it of the  congenital, unless we are satisfied with the roughest explanation,  namely, that a person brings along a congenital sexual impulse connected  with a definite sexual object. In the second case it is a question  whether the manifold accidental influences suffice to explain the  acquisition unless there is something in the individual to meet them  half way. The negation of this last factor is inadmissible according to  our former conclusions.    *The Relation of Bisexuality.*--Since the time of Frank Lydston,  Kiernan, and Chevalier, a new series of ideas has been introduced for  the explanation of the possibility of sexual inversion. This contains a  new contradiction to the popular belief which assumes that a human being  is either a man or a woman. Science shows cases in which the sexual  characteristics appear blurred and thus the sexual distinction is made  difficult, especially on an anatomical basis. The genitals of such  persons unite the male and female characteristics (hermaphroditism). In  rare cases both parts of the sexual apparatus are well developed (true  hermaphroditism), but usually both are stunted.[9]    The importance of these abnormalities lies in the fact that they  unexpectedly facilitate the understanding of the normal formation. A  certain degree of anatomical hermaphroditism really belongs to the  normal. In no normally formed male or female are traces of the apparatus  of the other sex lacking; these either continue functionless as  rudimentary organs, or they are transformed for the purpose of assuming  other functions.    The conception which we gather from this long known anatomical fact is  the original predisposition to bisexuality, which in the course of  development has changed to monosexuality, leaving slight remnants of the  stunted sex.    It was natural to transfer this conception to the psychic sphere and to  conceive the inversion in its aberrations as an expression of psychic  hermaphroditism. In order to bring the question to a decision, it was  only necessary to have one other circumstance, viz., a regular  concurrence of the inversion with the psychic and somatic signs of  hermaphroditism.    But this second expectation was not realized. The relations between the  assumed psychical and the demonstrable anatomical androgyny should never  be conceived as being so close. There is frequently found in the  inverted a diminution of the sexual impulse (H. Ellis) and a slight  anatomical stunting of the organs. This, however, is found frequently  but by no means regularly or preponderately. Thus we must recognize that  inversion and somatic hermaphroditism are totally independent of each  other.    Great importance has also been attached to the so-called secondary and  tertiary sex characters and their aggregate occurrence in the inverted  has been emphasized (H. Ellis). There is much truth in this but it  should not be forgotten that the secondary and tertiary sex  characteristics very frequently manifest themselves in the other sex,  thus indicating androgyny without, however, involving changes in the  sexual object in the sense of an inversion.    Psychic hermaphroditism would gain in substantiality if parallel with  the inversion of the sexual object there should be at least a change in  the other psychic qualities, such as in the impulses and distinguishing  traits characteristic of the other sex. But such inversion of character  can be expected with some regularity only in inverted women; in men the  most perfect psychic manliness may be united with the inversion. If one  firmly adheres to the hypothesis of a psychic hermaphroditism, one must  add that in certain spheres its manifestations allow the recognition of  only a very slight contrary determination. The same also holds true in  the somatic androgyny. According to Halban, the appearance of individual  stunted organs and secondary sex characters are quite independent of  each other.[10]    A spokesman of the masculine inverts stated the bisexual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#3)"],[1," most noted Greek teachers, chief of whom, was his old  friend Molo, the coryphaeus of the Rhodian school[29]. Cicero, however,  formed while at Rhodes one friendship which largely influenced his views of  philosophy, that with Posidonius the pupil of Panaetius, the most famous  Stoic of the age. To him Cicero makes reference in his works oftener than  to any other instructor. He speaks of him as the greatest of the  Stoics[30]; as a most notable philosopher, to visit whom Pompey, in the  midst of his eastern campaigns, put himself to much trouble[31]; as a  minute inquirer[32]. He is scarcely ever mentioned without some expression  of affection, and Cicero tells us that he read his works more than those of  any other author[33]. Posidonius was at a later time resident at Rome, and  stayed in Cicero's house. Hecato the Rhodian, another pupil of Panaetius,  may have been at Rhodes at this time. Mnesarchus and Dardanus, also hearers  of Panaetius, belonged to an earlier time, and although Cicero was well  acquainted with the works of the former, he does not seem to have known  either personally.    From the year 77 to the year 68 B.C., when the series of letters begins,  Cicero was doubtless too busily engaged with legal and political affairs to  spend much time in systematic study. That his oratory owed much to  philosophy from the first he repeatedly insists; and we know from his  letters that it was his later practice to refresh his style by much study  of the Greek writers, and especially the philosophers. During the period  then, about which we have little or no information, we may believe that he  kept up his old knowledge by converse with his many Roman friends who had a  bent towards philosophy, as well as with the Greeks who from time to time  came to Rome and frequented the houses of the Optimates; to this he added  such reading as his leisure would allow. The letters contained in the first  book of those addressed to Atticus, which range over the years 68--62 B.C.,  afford many proofs of the abiding strength of his passion for literary  employment. In the earlier part of this time we find him entreating Atticus  to let him have a library which was then for sale; expressing at the same  time in the strongest language his loathing for public affairs, and his  love for books, to which he looks as the support of his old age[34]. In the  midst of his busiest political occupations, when he was working his hardest  for the consulship, his heart was given to the adornment of his Tusculan  villa in a way suited to his literary and philosophic tastes. This may be  taken as a specimen of his spirit throughout his life. He was before all  things a man of letters; compared with literature, politics and oratory  held quite a secondary place in his affections. Public business employed  his intellect, but never his heart.    The year 62 released him from the consulship and enabled him to indulge his  literary tastes. To this year belong the publication of his speeches, which  were crowded, he says, with the maxims of philosophy[35]; the history of  his consulship, in Latin and Greek, the Greek version which he sent to  Posidonius being modelled on Isocrates and Aristotle; and the poem on his  consulship, of which some fragments remain. A year or two later we find him  reading with enthusiasm the works of Dicaearchus, and keeping up his  acquaintance with living Greek philosophers[36]. His long lack of leisure  seems to have caused an almost unquenchable thirst for reading at this  time. His friend Paetus had inherited a valuable library, which he  presented to Cicero. It was in Greece at the time, and Cicero thus writes  to Atticus: \"If you love me and feel sure of my love for you, use all the  endeavours of your friends, clients, acquaintances, freedmen, and even  slaves to prevent a single leaf from being lost.... Every day I find  greater satisfaction in study, so far as my forensic labours permit[37].\"  At this period of his life Cicero spent much time in study at his estates  near Tusculum, Antium, Formiae, and elsewhere. I dwell with greater  emphasis on these facts, because of the idea now spread abroad that Cicero  was a mere dabbler in literature, and that his works were extempore  paraphrases of Greek books half understood. In truth, his appetite for  every kind of literature was insatiable, and his attainments in each  department considerable. He was certainly the most learned Roman of his  age, with the single exception of Varro. One of his letters to Atticus[38]  will give a fair picture of his life at this time. He especially studied  the political writings of the Greeks, such as Theophrastus and  Dicaearchus[39]. He also wrote historical memoirs after the fashion, of  Theopompus[40].    The years from 59--57 B.C. were years in which Cicero's private cares  overwhelmed all thought of other occupation. Soon after his return from  exile, in the year 56, he describes himself as \"devouring literature\" with  a marvellous man named Dionysius[41], and laughingly pronouncing that  nothing is sweeter than universal knowledge. He spent great part of the  year 55 at Cumae or Naples \"feeding upon\" the library of Faustus Sulla, the  son of the Dictator[42]. Literature formed then, he tells us, his solace  and support, and he would rather sit in a garden seat which Atticus had,  beneath a bust of Aristotle, than in the ivory chair of office. Towards the  end of the year, he was busily engaged on the _De Oratore_, a work which  clearly proves his continued familiarity with Greek philosophy[43]. In the  following year (54) he writes that politics must cease for him, and that he  therefore returns unreservedly to the life most in accordance with nature,  that of the student[44]. During this year he was again for the most part at  those of his country villas where his best collections of books were. At  this time was written the _De Republica_, a work to which I may appeal for  evidence that his old philosophical studies had by no means been allowed to  drop[45]. Aristotle is especially mentioned as one of the authors read at  this time[46]. In the year 52 B.C. came the _De Legibus_, written amid many  distracting occupations; a work professedly modelled on Plato and the older  philosophers of the Socratic schools.    In the year 51 Cicero, then on his way to Cilicia, revisited Athens, much  to his own pleasure and that of the Athenians. He stayed in the house of  Aristus, the brother of Antiochus and teacher of Brutus. His acquaintance  with this philosopher was lasting, if we may judge from the affectionate  mention in the _Brutus_[47]. Cicero also speaks in kindly terms of Xeno, an  Epicurean friend of Atticus, who was then with Patro at Athens. It was at  this time that Cicero interfered to prevent Memmius, the pupil of the great  Roman Epicurean Lucretius, from destroying the house in which Epicurus had  lived[48]. Cicero seems to have been somewhat disappointed with the state  of philosophy at Athens, Aristus being the only man of merit then resident  there[49]. On the journey from Athens to his province, he made the  acquaintance of Cratippus, who afterwards taught at Athens as head of the  Peripatetic school[50]. At this time he was resident at Mitylene, where  Cicero seems to have passed some time in his society[51]. He was by far the  greatest, Cicero said, of all the Peripatetics he had himself heard, and  indeed equal in merit to the most eminent of that school[52].    The care of that disordered province Cilicia enough to employ Cicero's  thoughts till the end of 50. Yet he yearned for Athens and philosophy. He  wished to leave some memorial of himself at the beautiful city, and  anxiously asked Atticus whether it would look foolish to build a [Greek:  propylon] at the Academia, as Appius, his predecessor, had done at  Eleusis[53]. It seems the Athenians of the time were in the habit of  adapting their ancient statues to suit the noble Romans of the day, and of  placing on them fulsome inscriptions. Of this practice Cicero speaks with  loathing. In one letter of this date he carefully discusses the errors  Atticus had pointed out in the books _De Republica_[54]. His wishes with  regard to Athens still kept their hold upon his mind, and on his way home  from Cilicia he spoke of conferring on the city some signal favour[55].  Cicero was anxious to show Rhodes, with its school of eloquence, to the two  boys Marcus and Quintus, who accompanied him, and they probably touched  there for a few days[56]. From thence they went to Athens, where Cicero  again stayed with Aristus[57], and renewed his friendship with other  philosophers, among them Xeno the friend of Atticus[58].    On Cicero's return to Italy public affairs were in a very critical  condition, and left little room for thoughts about literature. The letters  which belong to this time are very pathetic. Cicero several times contrasts  the statesmen of the time with the Scipio he had himself drawn in the _De  Republica_[59]; when he thinks of Caesar, Plato's description of the tyrant  is present to his mind[60]; when, he deliberates about the course he is  himself to take, he naturally recals the example of Socrates, who refused  to leave Athens amid the misrule of the thirty tyrants[61]. It is curious  to find Cicero, in the very midst of civil war, poring over the book of  Demetrius the Magnesian concerning concord[62]; or employing his days in  arguing with himself a string of abstract philosophical propositions about  tyranny[63]. Nothing could more clearly show that he was really a man of  books; by nothing but accident a politician. In these evil days, however,  nothing was long to his taste; books, letters, study, all in their turn  became unpleasant[64].    As soon as Cicero had become fully reconciled to Caesar in the year 46 he  returned with desperate energy to his old literary pursuits. In a letter  written to Varro in that year[65], he says \"I"]]]
