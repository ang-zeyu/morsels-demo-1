[Sidenote: _Transforming Inertness into Alertness_]    Pygmies cannot become giants physically or intellectually. But as the  puny youth can by systematic exercise broaden his frame and develop  his muscles into at least a semblance of the athlete, and can then  through his healthier appetite _and his faster rate of repair_  maintain himself without effort at the new standard; _so can the  mentally inert call forth their reserves of energy and maintain a  higher standard of activity and fruitfulness_.    Few men live on the plane of their highest efficiency. Few search the  recesses of the well-springs of power. The lives of most of us are  passed among the shallows of the mind without thought of the  possibilities that lurk within the deeper pools.    [Sidenote: _How the Mind Accumulates Energy_]    This accumulation of potential subconscious reserve energy is a result  of the evolution of man and the growing complexity of his life.    No man could, if he would, respond to all the impulses to muscular  action aroused in him by sense-impressions. It would be still less  possible for him to respond to every impulse to muscular action  awakened from the past with the remembered thought with which it is  associated.    Desire, interest, attention and the selective will must pick and  choose among these multitudinous tendencies to action.    Here, then, is another fact that has immediate bearing upon your  ability to carry out any ambition you may have. Your every action is  the net result of selection among a number of impulses and inhibitory  forces or tendencies.    [Sidenote: _The Threshold of Inhibition_]    As a general thing, consciousness is made up of a number of  conflicting ideas, each with its associated feeling and its impulse to  action. Just what you do in any particular case depends upon what  mental picture is strongest, is most vivid in consciousness, and thus  able to overcome all contrary tendencies.    As life becomes more and more complex, the number and variety of our  sensory experiences increase correspondingly. And so it comes about,  that _we have untold millions of sensory experiences, carrying with  them the impulses to muscular response, none of which, on account of  the multiplicity of conflicting ideas, is ever allowed to find release  and actually take form in muscular activity_.    [Sidenote: _Hidden Strength_]    The consequence is that only an exceedingly small proportion of the  mental energy that is developed within us is ever actually displayed.  _The rest is somehow and somewhere locked up behind the inhibitory  threshold._ It is stored away in _subconsciousness_ with the sensory  experiences of the past with which it is associated.    [Sidenote: _Giving a Man Scope_]    Quoting Mr. Waldo P. Warren: \"Much of the strength within men is  hidden, awaiting an occasion to reveal it. The head of a department in  a great manufacturing concern severed his connection with the firm,  his work falling upon a young man of twenty-five years. The young man  rose to the occasion, and in a very short time was conceded to be the  stronger executive of the two. He had been with the concern for  several years, and was regarded as a bright fellow, but his marked  success was a surprise to all who knew him--even to himself.    \"The fact is, the young man had that ability all the time and didn't  know it; and his employers didn't know it. He might have been doing  greater things all along if there had been the occasion to reveal his  strength.    \"Do you employers and superior officers in business realize how much  of this hidden strength there is in your men? Perhaps a word from you,  giving certain men more scope, would liberate that ability for the  development of both your business and your men.    \"Do you workers know your own strength? Are you working up to your  capacity? Or are you accepting the limits which the circumstances  place about you?\"          CHAPTER III    THE INITIATIVE ENERGY OF SUCCESS      [Sidenote: _Sources of Persistence_]    In such instances as we have recounted, men have found that persistent  effort along certain lines has had the effect of making presently  available what would otherwise be simply unused storage batteries of  reserve power. What was the source and inspiration for this persistent  effort?    You will say that it was ambition or patriotism or some similar  semi-emotional influence. And so it was. But what is ambition, what is  patriotism, _what is any desire but a picturing to the mind's eye of  the things desired, an awakening of a mental image_ of the result to  be attained, the reward that is to follow certain efforts? And these  mental pictures coming into consciousness have brought with them their  associated emotions and their associated impulses to muscular action,  impulses appropriate to the picture _and automatically tending to work  its realization_.    These impulses constitute the whole of man's achieving power. They are  the Initiative Energy of all Success.    [Sidenote: _Importance of the Mental Setting_]    When you are afflicted with doubt and fear, timidity and lack of  confidence, this means that your mental inhibitions are too numerous,  too high or too strong. Remove them and access is had to the latent  energy of accumulated and creative thought complexes. You will then  become buoyant, cheerful, overflowing with enthusiasm, and ready for a  fresh, definite, active part in life.    _Ideas, then, when latent, may be considered as possessing an  energizing influence_.    The same idea does not necessarily have the same effect upon the same  persons at different times. What its effect may be at any time or with  any individual depends upon the make-up of the consciousness in which  it finds itself.    [Sidenote: _Ideas All Men Respond to_]    The setting of consciousness may be entirely different upon the  present appearance of the particular idea from what it was on the  occasion when this same idea last appeared. Yesterday there may have  been present no conflicting tendencies, and this particular idea may  therefore have been allowed free and joyous expression. Today other  thoughts may be in the ascendency so that we look upon the idea of  yesterday with a feeling of revulsion.    The thought that aroused new energy in you yesterday may then sicken  you at your task today. The thought that stirs the soul of a vigorous  man may shock the sensibilities of a delicate woman.    [Sidenote: _How to Exalt the Personality_]    Yet there are some ideas to which all men in varying degrees seem  alike to respond. How often in battle have the failing spirits of an  army been revived by the appearance of the leader shouting his  battle-cry and waving his shining sword! How often have men been  roused to heights of heroic achievement by the strains of martial  music! How often have troops spent with exhaustion responded to the  call of such simple phrases as \"The Flag,\" \"Our Country,\" \"Liberty,\"  or such songs as \"The Marseillaise,\" \"God Save the King,\" \"Dixie\"!  These phrases are but the signs of ideas, yet the sounding of these  phrases has summoned these ideas into consciousness, and the summoning  of these ideas into consciousness has placed undreamed-of and  immeasurable foot-pounds of energy on the hair-trigger of action.    [Sidenote: _\"Good Starters\" and \"Strong Finishers\"_]    And so it is with you. Down deep in the inmost chambers of your soul  are untouched stores of energy that properly applied will exalt your  personality and illumine your career.    But to find and claim these hidden riches you must persevere. You must  endure.    In a Marathon race it is endurance that wins. The graceful sprinter  who is off with a leap at the bark of the pistol soon falls by the  wayside.    Life is a Marathon in which persistence triumphs.    There are many \"good starters,\" but few \"strong finishers.\" That is  why the failures so outnumber the successes.    [Sidenote: _Steps in Self-Development_]    The man who travels fastest does more than he is told to do. To merely  comply with a fixed routine is to fall short of one's duty. The  progressive man adds to the work of today his preparation for the work  of tomorrow. He delights in attempting more and more difficult tasks,  because in every task he sets himself he sees a step forward in the  development of his own abilities. He loves his work more than he loves  his pay, and he delves deeper than the exigencies of the moment  require, because he craves the power to do more.    Most men start with enthusiasm. No hours are too long, no task too  difficult. But soon they tire. And lacking will-power to persist, they  succumb to the lure of distracting interests. They become disheartened  and indifferent. And so they fail.    [Sidenote: _Saving a Thousand a Year_]    A young man married. He was proprietor of a flourishing \"general\"  store in Princeton, Indiana. He and his bride forthwith resolved that  they could and would lay aside out of their income a thousand dollars  a year for ten years, by which time they would have ten thousand  dollars and accumulated interest and could go into business in a big  city. At the end of the first year, when they took stock of their  savings, they decided that thereafter, instead of trying to save a  thousand dollars a year for ten years, they would undertake to save  ten dollars a year for a thousand years and would be more apt to  succeed. Today they are just where they began.    You all know such men--men who are always starting and never  finishing.    [Sidenote: _Looking for a \"Soft Snap\"_]    Ninety-five per cent of the men who go into business are \"quitters.\"  The very first disappointment sends them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#3)"],[1,"the comparatively recent of these discoveries is Crystal Cave, at  Joplin, described on page 566, Vol. VII., Missouri Geological Survey  Report 1894.[1] It was opened in the lower workings of a shaft of the  Empire Zinc Company, and \"The entire surface of the cave, top, sides and  bottom, is lined with calcite crystals, so closely packed together as  to form a continuous sheet and most of them of great size, and well  formed faces. Scalenohedra as much as two feet long are sometimes seen,  and others a foot or more in length are common. Planes or crystal  ghosts, sometimes with pyrite crystals, marking stages of growth in the  calcite crystals, are often distinguishable. The entire absence of  anything like stalactites is noticeable, and together with the presence  of the crystals, show that the cave was completely filled with water  during their growth.\" In the same volume, all those counties in the  extreme southwest corner of the state, whose geological age has not  heretofore been considered positively determined, are mapped as Lower  Carboniferous, and Lower Silurian, with the Coal Measures covering  portions of Barton and Jasper and appearing in a few small, scattered  spots in Dade, Polk, Green and Christian counties, and some scanty lines  of Devonian fringing the edges of the Silurian in Barton and McDonald.    Other State reports make mention of many caves and fine springs, and  also several natural bridges worthy of special notice. In Mr. G.C.  Broadhead's report for 1873-1874, he gives a short but interesting  chapter on caves and water supplies, in which he says that \"Caves occur  in the Third Magnesian Limestone, Saccharoidal Sandstone, Trenton,  Lithographic, Encrinital and St. Louis Limestone.\"    \"In Eastern and Northeast Missouri there have not been found many large  caves in the Encrinital Limestone, but the lower beds of this formation  in Southwest Missouri often enclose very large caverns; among the latter  may be included the caves of Green County with some in Christian and  McDonald. Those in McDonald I have not seen, but they are reported to be  very extensive and probably are situated in the Encrinital Limestone.\"    Under the head of \"Special Descriptions\" he says: \"On Sac River, in the  north part of Green County, we find a cave with two entrances, one at  the foot of a hill, opening toward Sac River, forty-five feet high and  eighty feet wide. The other entrance is from the hill-top, one hundred  and fifty feet back from the face of the bluff. These two passages  unite. The exact dimensions of the cave are not known, but there are  several beautiful and large rooms lined with stalactites and stalagmites  which often assume both beautiful and grotesque life-like forms. The  cave has been explored for several hundred yards, showing the formations  to be thick silicious beds of the Lower Carboniferous formations.\"    \"Knox cave, in Green County, is said to be of large dimensions. I have  not seen it, but some of its stalactites are quite handsome.\"    \"Wilson's Creek sinks beneath the Limestone and appears again below.\"    \"There are several caves near Ozark, Christian County, which issue from  the same formation as those in Green County. On a branch of Finly Creek  a stream disappears in a sink, appearing again three-quarters of a mile  southeast through an opening sixty feet high by ninety-eight feet wide.  Up stream the cave continues this size for a hundred yards and then  decreases in size, and for the next quarter of a mile further it is  generally ten by fourteen feet wide. A very clear, cool stream passes  out, in which by careful search crawfish without eyes can be found.\"    \"There is another cave a few miles south of Ozark, and another ten miles  southeast occurs in the Magnesian Limestone.\"    \"In Boone County there are several caves in the Encrinital Limestone.  Conner's, the largest, is said to have been explored for a distance of  eight miles.\"    \"In Pike and Lincoln there are several small caves occurring in the  upper beds of Trenton Limestone, which are often very cavernous. On  Sulphur Fork of Cuivre, there is a cave and Natural Bridge, to which  parties for pleasure often resort. The bridge is tubular with twenty  feet between the walls, and is one hundred feet long.\"    \"At J.P. Fisher's on Spencer Creek, Ralls County, there is a cave having  an entrance of ninety feet wide by twenty feet high. The Lower Trenton  beds occupy the floor, with the upper cavernous beds above. On the  bluff, at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards back, there is a  sink-hole which communicates with the cave. Within the cave is a cool,  clear spring of water, and Mr. F. said he could keep meat fresh there  for six weeks during midsummer.\"    \"The Third Magnesian Limestone which occupies such a large portion of  Southwest Missouri, often contains very large caves. One of them, known  as Friede's cave, is six or eight miles Northwest of Rolla, on Cave  Spring Creek.\"    \"It is said to have been explored for several miles, but I only passed  in a few hundred yards. The stalactites here are very beautiful,  assuming the structure of satin spar. A very clear stream of water  issues out. West of the Gasconade, on Clifty Creek, is a remarkable  Natural Bridge which I have elsewhere described in Geological Survey of  Missouri, 1855-71, page 16.\"    \"Mr. Meek speaks of a large and interesting cave on Tavern Creek, in  Miller County. Dr. Shumard estimates a cave on Bryant's Fork, in Ozark  County, to be a mile and a half long.\"    This description of Dr. Shumard's is in the Geological Survey of  Missouri, 1855-71, page 196, where he says:    \"The entrance is thirty-five feet wide and thirty feet high, and is  situated at the foot of a perpendicular cliff, and far above the  water-level of Bryant. Just within the entrance it expands to sixty or  seventy feet, with a height of about fifty feet; and this part of the  cave has been used by the citizens of the county as a place for holding  camp-meeting. I estimated its length at not far short of one mile and a  half. The main passage is in general quite spacious, the roof elevated,  and the floor tolerably level, but often wet and miry. For some distance  beyond the entrance there is not much to attract attention; but as we  proceed, at the far extremity the chambers are quite as picturesque as  the most noted of the well-known Mammoth Cave. The ceilings, sides and  floor are adorned with a multitude of stalactites and stalagmites  arranged in fanciful combinations, and assuming a variety of fantastic  and beautiful forms.\"    Many of these caves contain niter, which occurs as a mineral and not as  evidence of former animal occupation, it being found in the form of  effervescenses on the walls. Dr. Shumard mentions several of this  character in Pulaski County, the most noted being Niter Cave, in the  Third Magnesian Limestone, with a wide entrance thirty feet above the  level of the Gasconade. On page 201, he also gives a charming  description of one of the immense springs that are numerous in this  region and that I have never seen elsewhere. He says:    \"Ozark County is bountifully supplied with springs of the finest water,  and some of them of remarkably large size. The largest one is situated  near the North Fork, in T. 24, R. 11 W., Sec. 32, and is known under the  name of the Double Spring. It issues from near the base of a bluff of  Sandstone and Magnesian Limestone, a few feet above the level of the  North Fork. This spring discharges an immense volume of water, which is  divided by a huge mass of Sandstone into two streams, with swift  currents flowing in opposite directions to join the North Fork about one  hundred and fifty yards distant from the spring. I estimated the width  of these streams at not less than fifty yards. They are separated from  the North Fork by a pretty wooded island one hundred yards long. The  upper stream affords a good mill-site. I am informed that the quantity  of water discharged by this magnificent spring is not materially  diminished during the dryest seasons of the year. The temperature of the  water measured at the edge of the spring, was found to be 56 deg.; the  temperature of the air at the same time, 59 deg. Other springs of  considerable magnitude occur in various portions of the county, giving  rise to beautiful and limpid streams.\"    The descriptions of the Natural Bridge and Friede's cave, near Rolla,  previously referred to as being on page 16 of the same volume, are as  follows:    \"On Clifty Creek found the chert bed of Sec. 21-5 occurring about sixty  feet from the top of the Third Magnesian Limestone, with a road passing  over its upper surface, presenting it very favorably for observation. It  seemed here to be broken by vertical cracks into large rhomboidal  blocks. Further up this creek in a wild and secluded spot, observed a  Natural Bridge with six feet of this chert bed at its base, and  Silicious Magnesian Limestone above. The span of this bridge is about  thirty feet, an elevation of opening about fifteen feet above the water,  the thickness of the rock above is about twelve feet, and width on top  about fifteen feet. Two small streams come together, one from the west  and another from the south-west. A point of the bluff on the south-west  fork spans the northern fork, and terminates about sixty feet beyond in  a sharp point; a few large masses of rock lie near the termination of  the promontory, and fifty feet beyond, the bluffs of the opposite hills  rise abruptly from the bottoms. The bluffs, both above and below, are  very precipitous, the middle and lower beds of the Third Magnesian  Limestone forming perpendicular escarpments, frequently studded with  cedar, some occurring on top of the bridge. A perfectly clear stream of  water courses through this valley. The bottoms near are overspread with  a dense growth of trees and vines, among which latter I noticed the"]]]
