[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14672"],[0,"The Religion of the Ancient Celts (#3)"],[1," gained a more universal character,  absorbing divinities with similar functions. Still this local character  must be borne in mind. The numerous divinities of Gaul, with differing  names--but, judging by their assimilation to the same Roman divinity,  similar functions, are best understood as gods of local groups. This is  probably true also of Britain and Ireland. But those gods worshipped far  and wide over the Celtic area may be gods of the undivided Celts, or  gods of some dominant Celtic group extending their influence on all  sides, or, in some cases, popular gods whose cult passed beyond the  tribal bounds. If it seem precarious to see such close similarity in the  local gods of a people extending right across Europe, appeal can be made  to the influence of the Celtic temperament, producing everywhere the  same results, and to the homogeneity of Celtic civilisation, save in  local areas, e.g. the South of Gaul. Moreover, the comparison of the  various testimonies of onlookers points to a general similarity, while  the permanence of the primitive elements in Celtic religion must have  tended to keep it everywhere the same. Though in Gaul we have only  inscriptions and in Ireland only distorted myths, yet those testimonies,  as well as the evidence of folk-survivals in both regions, point to the  similarity of religious phenomena. The Druids, as a more or less  organised priesthood, would assist in preserving the general likeness.    Thus the primitive nature-spirits gave place to greater or lesser gods,  each with his separate department and functions. Though growing  civilisation tended to separate them from the soil, they never quite  lost touch with it. In return for man's worship and sacrifices, they  gave life and increase, victory, strength, and skill. But these  sacrifices, had been and still often were rites in which the  representative of a god was slain. Some divinities were worshipped over  a wide area, most were gods of local groups, and there were spirits of  every place, hill, wood, and stream. Magic rites mingled with the cult,  but both were guided by an organised priesthood. And as the Celts  believed in unseen gods, so they believed in an unseen region whither  they passed after death.    Our knowledge of the higher side of Celtic religion is practically a  blank, since no description of the inner spiritual life has come down to  us. How far the Celts cultivated religion in our sense of the term, or  had glimpses of Monotheism, or were troubled by a deep sense of sin, is  unknown. But a people whose spiritual influence has later been so great,  must have had glimpses of these things. Some of them must have known the  thirst of the soul for God, or sought a higher ethical standard than  that of their time. The enthusiastic reception of Christianity, the  devotion of the early Celtic saints, and the character of the old Celtic  church, all suggest this.    The relation of the Celtic church to paganism was mainly intolerant,  though not wholly so. It often adopted the less harmful customs of the  past, merging pagan festivals in its own, founding churches on the sites  of the old cult, dedicating sacred wells to a saint. A saint would visit  the tomb of a pagan to hear an old epic rehearsed, or would call up  pagan heroes from hell and give them a place in paradise. Other saints  recall dead heroes from the Land of the Blessed, and learn the nature of  that wonderland and the heroic deeds      \"Of the old days, which seem to be     Much older than any history     That is written in any book.\"    Reading such narratives, we gain a lesson in the fine spirit of  Christian tolerance and Christian sympathy.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] Some writers saw in the bardic poetry a Druidic-esoteric system and  traces of a cult practised secretly by the bards--the \"Neo-Druidic  heresy\"; see Davies, _Myth. of the Brit. Druids_, 1809; Herbert, _The  Neo-Druidic Heresy_, 1838. Several French writers saw in \"Druidism\" a  monotheistic faith, veiled under polytheism.    [3] Livy, v. 46; Caesar, vi. 16; Dion.

Scrutiny reveals the fact that Celtic-speaking peoples are of differing  types--short and dark as well as tall and fairer Highlanders or  Welshmen, short, broad-headed Bretons, various types of Irishmen. Men  with Norse names and Norse aspect \"have the Gaelic.\" But all alike have  the same character and temperament, a striking witness to the influence  which the character as well as the language of the Celts, whoever they  were, made on all with whom they mingled. Ethnologically there may not  be a Celtic race, but something was handed down from the days of  comparative Celtic purity which welded different social elements into a  common type, found often where no Celtic tongue is now spoken. It  emerges where we least expect it, and the stolid Anglo-Saxon may  suddenly awaken to something in himself due to a forgotten Celtic strain  in his ancestry.    Two main theories of Celtic origins now hold the field:    (1) The Celts are identified with the progenitors of the short,  brachycephalic \"Alpine race\" of Central Europe, existing there in  Neolithic times, after their migrations from Africa and Asia. The type  is found among the Slavs, in parts of Germany and Scandinavia, and in  modern France in the region of Caesar's \"Celtae,\" among the Auvergnats,  the Bretons, and in Lozere and Jura. Representatives of the type have  been found in Belgian and French Neolithic graves.[6] Professor Sergi  calls this the \"Eurasiatic race,\" and, contrary to general opinion,  identifies it with the Aryans, a savage people, inferior to the  dolichocephalic Mediterranean race, whose language they Aryanised.[7]  Professor Keane thinks that they were themselves an Aryanised folk  before reaching Europe, who in turn gave their acquired Celtic and  Slavic speech to the preceding masses. Later came the Belgae, Aryans, who  acquired the Celtic speech of the people they conquered.[8]    Broca assumed that the dark, brachycephalic people whom he identified  with Caesar's \"Celtae,\" differed from the Belgae, were conquered by them,  and acquired the language of their conquerors, hence wrongly called  Celtic by philologists. The Belgae were tall and fair, and overran Gaul,  except Aquitaine, mixing generally with the Celtae, who in Caesar's time  had thus an infusion of Belgic blood.[9] But before this conquest, the  Celtae had already mingled with the aboriginal dolichocephalic folk of  Gaul, Iberians, or Mediterraneans of Professor Sergi. The latter had  apparently remained comparatively pure from admixture in Aquitaine, and  are probably the Aquitani of Caesar.[10]    But were the short, brachycephalic folk Celts? Caesar says the people who  call themselves \"Celtae\" were called Gauls by the Romans, and Gauls,  according to classical writers, were tall and fair.[11] Hence the Celtae  were not a short, dark race, and Caesar himself says that Gauls  (including Celtae) looked with contempt on the short Romans.[12] Strabo  also says that Celtae and Belgae had the same Gaulish appearance, i.e.  tall and fair. Caesar's statement that Aquitani, Galli, and Belgae differ  in language, institutions, and laws is vague and unsupported by  evidence, and may mean as to language no more than a difference in  dialects. This is also suggested by Strabo's words, Celtae and Belgae  \"differ a little\" in language.[13] No classical writer describes the  Celts as short and dark, but the reverse. Short, dark people would have  been called Iberians, without respect to skulls. Classical observers  were not craniologists. The short, brachycephalic type is now prominent  in France, because it has always been so, eliminating the tall, fair  Celtic type. Conquering Celts, fewer in number than the broad and  narrow-headed aborigines, intermarried or made less lasting alliances  with them. In course of time the type of the more numerous race was  bound to prevail. Even in Caesar's day the latter probably outnumbered  the tall and fair Celts, who had, however, Celticised them. But  classical writers, who knew the true Celt as tall and fair, saw that  type only, just as every one, on first visiting France or Germany, sees  his generalised type of Frenchman or German everywhere. Later, he  modifies his opinion, but this the classical observers did not do.  Caesar's campaigns must have drained Gaul of many tall and fair Celts.  This, with the tendency of dark types to out-number fair types in South  and Central Europe, may help to explain the growing prominence of the  dark type, though the tall, fair type is far from uncommon.[14]    (2) The second theory, already anticipated, sees in Gauls and Belgae a  tall, fair Celtic folk, speaking a Celtic language, and belonging to the  race which stretched from Ireland to Asia Minor, from North Germany to  the Po, and were masters of Teutonic tribes till they were driven by  them from the region between Elbe and Rhine.[15] Some Belgic tribes  claimed a Germanic ancestry,[16] but \"German\" was a word seldom used  with precision, and in this case may not mean Teutonic. The fair hair of  this people has made many suppose that they were akin to the Teutons.  But fairness is relative, and the dark Romans may have called brown hair  fair, while they occasionally distinguished between the \"fair\" Gauls and  fairer Germans. Their institutions and their religions (_pace_ Professor  Rh[^y]s) differed, and though they were so long in contact the names of  their gods and priests are unlike.[17] Their languages, again, though of  \"Aryan\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#3)"],[1," which supposes the globe to rest on an elephant, the elephant  on a turtle, and the turtle on nothing at all.    If the people were so ignorant, how happened the priests to be so wise? If  the people were so credulous, why were not the priests credulous too?  \"Like people, like priests,\" is a proverb approved by experience. Among  so many nations and through so many centuries, why has not some one priest  betrayed the secret of the famous imposition? Apply a similar theory to  any other human institution, and how patent is its absurdity! Let a  republican contend that all other forms of government--the patriarchal  system, government by castes, the feudal system, absolute and limited  monarchies, oligarchies, and aristocracies--are wholly useless and evil,  and were the result of statecraft alone, with no root in human nature or  the needs of man. Let one maintain that every system of _law_ (except our  own) was an invention of lawyers for private ends. Let one argue in the  same way about medicine, and say that this is a pure system of quackery,  devised by physicians, in order to get a support out of the people for  doing nothing. We should at once reply that, though error and ignorance  may play a part in all these institutions, they cannot be based on error  and ignorance only. Nothing which has not in it some elements of use can  hold its position in the world during so long a time and over so wide a  range. It is only reasonable to say the same of heathen or ethnic  religions. They contain, no doubt, error and evil. No doubt priestcraft  has been carried very far in them, though not further perhaps than it has  sometimes been carried in Christianity. But unless they contained more of  good than evil, they could not have kept their place. They partially  satisfied a great hunger of the human heart. They exercised some restraint  on human wilfulness and passion. They have directed, however imperfectly,  the human conscience toward the right. To assume that they are wholly evil  is disrespectful to human nature. It supposes man to be the easy and  universal dupe of fraud. But these religions do not rest on such a sandy  foundation, but on the feeling of dependence, the sense of accountability,  the recognition of spiritual realities very near to this world of matter,  and the need of looking up and worshipping some unseen power higher and  better than ourselves. A decent respect for the opinions of mankind  forbids us to ascribe pagan religions to priestcraft as their chief  source.    And a reverence for Divine Providence brings us to the same conclusion.  Can it be that God has left himself without a witness in the world, except  among the Hebrews in ancient times and the Christians in modern times?  This narrow creed excludes God from any communion with the great majority  of human beings. The Father of the human race is represented as selecting  a few of his children to keep near himself, and as leaving all the rest to  perish in their ignorance and error. And this is not because they are  prodigal children who have gone astray into a far country of their own  accord; for they are just where they were placed by their Creator. HE \"has  determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation.\"  HE has caused some to be born in India, where they can only hear of him  through Brahmanism; and some in China, where they can know him only  through Buddha and Confucius. The doctrine which we are opposing is; that,  being put there by God, they are born into hopeless error, and are then  punished for their error by everlasting destruction. The doctrine for  which we contend is that of the Apostle Paul, that God has \"determined  beforehand the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek the Lord,  IF HAPLY THEY MAY FEEL AFTER HIM AND FIND HIM.\" Paul teaches that \"all  nations dwelling on all the face of the earth\" may not only seek and feel  after God, but also FIND him. But as all living in heathen lands are  heathen, if they find God at all, they must find him through heathenism.  The pagan religions are the effort of man to feel after God. Otherwise we  must conclude that the Being without whom not a sparrow falls to the  ground, the Being who never puts an insect into the air or a polyp into  the water without providing it with some appropriate food, so that it may  live and grow, has left the vast majority of his human children, made with  religious appetences of conscience, reverence, hope, without a  corresponding nutriment of truth. This view tends to atheism; for if the  presence of adaptation everywhere is the legitimate proof of creative  design, the absence of adaptation in so important a sphere tends, so far,  to set aside that proof.    The view which we are opposing contradicts that law of progress which  alone gives meaning and unity to history. Instead of progress, it teaches  degeneracy and failure. But elsewhere we see progress, not recession.  Geology shows us higher forms of life succeeding to the lower. Botany  exhibits the lichens and mosses preparing a soil for more complex forms of  vegetation. Civil history shows the savage state giving way to the  semi-civilized, and that to the civilized. If heathen religions are a  step, a preparation for Christianity, then this law of degrees appears  also in religion; then we see an order in the progress of the human  soul,--\"first the blade, then the ear, afterward the full corn in the  ear.\" Then we can understand why Christ's coming was delayed till the  fulness of the time had come. But otherwise all, in this most important  sphere of human life, is in disorder, without unity, progress, meaning, or  providence.    These views, we trust, will be amply confirmed when we come to examine  each great religion separately and carefully. We shall find them always  feeling after God, often finding him. We shall see that in their origin  they are not the work of priestcraft, but of human nature; in their  essence not superstitions, but religions; in their doctrines true more  frequently than false; in their moral tendency good rather than evil. And  instead of degenerating toward something worse, they come to prepare the  way for something better.        Sec. 4. How Ethnic Religions were regarded by Christ and his Apostles.      According to Christ and the Apostles, Christianity was to grow out of  Judaism, and be developed into a universal religion. Accordingly, the  method of Jesus was to go first to the Jews; and when he left the limits  of Palestine on a single occasion, he declared himself as only going into  Phoenicia to seek after the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But he  stated that he had other sheep, not of this fold, whom he must bring,  recognizing that there were, among the heathen, good and honest hearts  prepared for Christianity, and already belonging to him; sheep who knew  his voice and were ready to follow him. He also declared that the Roman  centurion and the Phoenician woman already possessed great faith, the  centurion more than he had yet found in Israel. But the most striking  declaration of Jesus, and one singularly overlooked, concerning the  character of the heathen, is to be found in his description of the day of  judgment, in Matthew (chap. XXV.). It is very curious that men should  speculate as to the fate of the heathen, when Jesus has here distinctly  taught that all good men among them are his sheep, though they never heard  of him. The account begins, \"Before him shall be gathered all the  Gentiles\" (or heathen). It is not a description of the judgment of the  Christian world, but of the heathen world. The word here used ([Greek: ta  ethnae]) occurs about one hundred and sixty-four times in the New  Testament. It is translated \"gentiles\" oftener than by any other word,  that is, about ninety-three times; by \"heathen\" four or five times; and in  the remaining passages it is mostly translated \"nations.\" That it means  the Gentiles or heathen here appears from the fact that they are  represented as ignorant of Christ, and are judged, not by the standard of  Christian faith, but by their humanity and charity toward those in  suffering. Jesus recognizes, therefore, among these ethnic or heathen  people, some as belonging to himself,--the \"other sheep,\" not of the  Jewish fold.    The Apostle Paul, who was especially commissioned to the Gentiles, must be  considered as the best authority upon this question. Did he regard their  religions as wholly false? On the contrary, he tells the Athenians that  they are already worshipping the true God, though ignorantly. \"Whom ye  ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you.\" When he said this he was  standing face to face with all that was most imposing in the religion of  Greece. He saw the city filled with idols, majestic forms, the perfection  of artistic grace and beauty. Was his spirit then moved _only_ with  indignation against this worship, and had he no sympathy with the  spiritual needs which it expressed? It does not seem so. He recognized  piety in their souls. \"I see that ye are, in all ways, exceedingly  pious.\" He recognized their worship as passing beyond the idols, to the  true God. He did not profess that he came to revolutionize their religion,  but to reform it. He does not proceed like the backwoodsman, who fells the  forest and takes out the stumps in order to plant a wholly different crop;  but like the nurseryman, who grafts a native stock with a better fruit.  They were already ignorantly worshipping the true God. What the apostle  proposed to do was to enlighten that ignorance by showing them who that  true God was, and what was his character. In his subsequent remarks,  therefore, he does not teach them that there is one Supreme Being, but he  _assumes_ it, as something already believed. He assumes him to be the  creator of all things; to be _omnipotent_,--\"the Lord of heaven and  earth\"; _spiritual_,--\"dwelleth not in temples made"]]]
