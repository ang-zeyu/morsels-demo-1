It's queer there isn't some better, or  more effective, way of fighting a fire than just pouring on a  comparatively insignificant bit of water,\" he added, as, from what was  now a safe distance, they watched the firemen using many lines of hose.    \"They do have chemical extinguishers,\" said Ned.    \"Yes, for little baby blazes that have just started,\" went on Mr.  Nestor. \"But in all the progress of science there has not been much  advance in fighting fires. We still do as they did a hundred years  ago--squirt water on it, and mighty little of it compared to the blaze.  It would take a week to put this fire out by the water they are using  if it were not for the fact that the blaze eats itself up and has  nothing more to feed on.\"    \"We'll have to get Tom to invent a new way of fighting fire,\" remarked  Ned.    The young inventor was about to reply when several firemen, equipped  with smoke helmets which they adjusted as they ran, came running down  the street.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom of one whom he knew.    \"Some men are trapped in a small shed back of the factory,\" was the  answer. \"We just heard of it, and we're going in after them.  Oh!  Oh--my--my heart!\" he gasped, and he sank to the sidewalk.  Evidently  he was either overcome by the smoke and poisonous gases or by his  exertions.    Tom grasped the situation instantly. Taking the smoke helmet from the  exhausted fire-fighter, the young inventor shouted:    \"I'll fill your place! See if you can grab a hat, Ned, and come on!\"    One of the other firemen had two helmets, and he offered Ned one.  Pausing only long enough to see that Mr. Nestor and some others were  looking after the exhausted \"smoke-eater,\" Ned raced on after Tom. The  two young men, following the firemen, made their way around the end of  the factory to the smoke-filled yard in the rear. But for the helmets,  which were like the gas masks of the Great War, they would not have  been able to live.    One of the firemen pointed through the luridly-lighted smoke to a small  structure near the main building. This was beginning to burn. With  quick blows of an axe the door was hewed down, and the rescue party,  including Tom and Ned, made its way inside. In the light from the  blaze, as it filtered through the windows, it could be seen that a man  lay in a huddled heap on the floor.    By motions the leader of the rescue squad made it clear that the man  was to be carried out, and Tom helped with this while Ned, using an  axe, cleared away some debris to enable the door to be opened fully so  the men could pass out carrying their burden.    The man was taken to the Nestor yard and stretched out on the grass.  Word was relayed to one of the ambulance doctors who were on the scene  attending to several injured firemen, and in a short time the man, who,  it appeared, had been overcome by smoke, was revived.    \"Well, that was a narrow squeak for you,\" said one of the firemen, glad  to breathe without a mask on.    \"Yes, it was touch and go,\" remarked the young doctor, who had used  heroic measures to bring the man back from the brink of the grave. \"But  you'll live now, all right.\"    The revived man looked dully about him. He seemed somewhat bewildered.    \"Of what use to live?\" he murmured. \"You might as well have let me die  in there. Life isn't worth living now,\" and he sank into a stupor,  while Tom and the others looked wonderingly at one another.          CHAPTER III    TOM'S NEW IDEA      \"What's the matter with him, Doctor?\" asked Tom in a low voice of the  young physician who had been working over the man. \"Do you think he is  worse hurt than appears? Is he dying, and is his mind wandering?\"    \"I don't believe so,\" answered the doctor. \"At least I don't believe  that he is dying, though his mind may be wandering. He isn't  injured--at least not outwardly. Just temporarily overcome by smoke is  what it looks like to me. But of course I haven't made a thorough  examination.\"    \"Hadn't we better get him into the house, Doctor?\" asked Mr. Nestor,  who stood with Tom, Ned and a group of men and boys about the inert  form of the man lying on the grass. The rescued one was again seemingly  unconscious.    \"The best medicine he can have is fresh air,\" the doctor replied. \"He's  better off out here than in the house. Though if he doesn't revive  presently I will send him to the hospital.\"    The man did not appear to be so badly off but what he could hear, and  at these words he opened his eyes again.    \"I don't want to go to the hospital,\" he murmured. \"I'll be all right  presently, and can go home, though--Oh, well, what's the use?\" he asked  wearily, as though he had given up some fight.  \"I've lost everything.\"    \"Well, you've got a deal of life left in you yet; and that's more than  you could say of some who have come out of smaller fires than this,\"  said one of the firemen who, with Tom, had carried the man out of the  shed. \"Come on, we'd better be getting back,\" he said to his companion.  \"The worst of it is over, but there'll be plenty to do yet.\"    \"You said it!\" commented the other grimly.    They went out of the Nestor yard, many of the crowd that had gathered  during the rescue following. The doctor administered some more  stimulant in the shape of aromatic spirits of ammonia to the man, who,  after his momentary revival, had again lapsed into a state of stupor.    \"Who is he?\" asked Tom, as the physician knelt down beside the silent  form.    \"I don't know,\" said Mr. Nestor. \"I know quite a number connected with  the fireworks factory, but this man is a stranger to me.\"    \"I've seen him going into the main offices several times,\" remarked  Mary, who was standing beside Tom. \"He seemed to be one of the company  officers.\"    \"I don't believe so, Mary,\" stated her father. \"I know most of the  fireworks company officials, and I'm sure this man is not one of them.  Poor fellow! He seems to be in a bad way.\"    \"Mentally, as well as physically,\" put in Ned. \"He acted as if sorry  that we had saved his life.\"    \"Too bad,\" murmured Mary, and then a policeman, who had just come into  the yard to get the facts for his report, looked at the figure lying on  the grass, and said:    \"I know him.\"    \"You do?\" cried Tom. \"Who is he?\"    \"Name's Baxter, Josephus Baxter. He's a chemist, and he works in the  fireworks factory here. Not as one of the hands, but in the experiment  laboratory. I've seen him there late at night lots of times. That's how  I got acquainted with him. He was going in around two o'clock one  morning, and I stopped him, thinking he was a thief. He proved his  identity, and I've passed the time of day with him many a time since.\"    \"Where does he live?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"Down on Clay Street,\" and the officer mentioned the number.  \"He lives  all alone, so he told me. He's some sort of an inventor, I guess. At  least I judged so by his talk. Do you want an ambulance, Doctor?\" he  asked the physician.    \"No, I think he's coming around all right,\" was the answer. \"If we had  an auto we could send him home.\"    \"I'll take him in the runabout,\" eagerly offered Tom. \"But if he lives  all alone will it be safe to leave him in his house?\"    \"He ought to be looked after, I suppose,\" the doctor stated.  \"He'll be  all right in a day or so if no complications set in, but he'll be weak  for a while and need attention.\"    \"Then I'll take him home with me!\" announced Tom. \"We have plenty of  room, and Mrs. Baggert will feel right at home with some one to nurse.  Bring the runabout here, will you please, Ned?\"    As Ned darted off to run up the machine, the man opened his eyes again.  For a moment he did not seem to know where he was or what had happened.  Then, as he saw the lurid light of the flames which were now dying away  and realized his position, he sighed heavily and murmured:    \"It's all over!\"    \"Oh, no, it isn't!\" cheerfully exclaimed the doctor. \"You will be all  right in a few days.\"    \"Myself, yes, maybe,\" said the man bitterly, and he managed to rise to  his feet. \"But what of my future? It is all gone! The work of years is  lost.\"    \"Burned in the fire?\" asked Tom, wondering whether the man was a major  stockholder in the company. \"Didn't you have any insurance? Though I  suppose you couldn't get much on a fireworks plant,\" he added, for he  knew something of insurance matters in connection with his own business.    \"Oh, it isn't the fire--that is directly,\" said the man, in the same  bitter tones. \"I've lost everything! The scoundrels stole them! And  I--Oh, never mind!\" he cried. \"What's the use of talking? I'm down and  out! I might just as well have died in the fire!\"    Tom was about to make some remark, but the doctor motioned to him to  refrain, and then Ned came up with the runabout. At first Josephus  Baxter, which was the name of the man who had been rescued, made some  objections to going to Tom's home. But when it was pointed out that he  might lapse into a stupor again from the effects of the smoke poisons,  in which event he would have no one to minister to him at his lonely  home, he consented to go to the residence of the young inventor.    \"Though if I do lapse into unconsciousness you might as well let me  keep on sleeping until the end,\" said Mr. Baxter bitterly to Tom and  Ned, as they drove away from the scene of the fire with him.    \"Oh, you'll feel better in the morning,\" cheerfully declared Ned.    The man did not answer, and the two chums did not feel much like  talking, for they were worn out and weary from their exertions at the  fire. The factory had been pretty well consumed, though by strenuous  labors the blaze had not extended to adjoining structures. The home of  Mary Nestor was saved, and for this Tom Swift was thankful.    Mrs. Baggert, the Swift's housekeeper, was indeed glad to have some one  to \"fuss over,\" as Tom put it.

I do not hold my tongue easily;  and my inborn dramatic faculty and professional habit as a playwright  prevent me from taking a one-sided view even when the most probable  result of taking a many-sided one is prompt lynching. Besides, until  Home Rule emerges from its present suspended animation, I shall retain  my Irish capacity for criticising England with something of the  detachment of a foreigner, and perhaps with a certain slightly malicious  taste for taking the conceit out of her. Lord Kitchener made a mistake  the other day in rebuking the Irish volunteers for not rallying faster  to the defense of \"their country.\" They do not regard it as their  country yet. He should have asked them to come forward as usual and help  poor old England through a stiff fight. Then it would have been all  right.    Having thus frankly confessed my bias, which you can allow for as a  rifleman allows for the wind, I give my views for what they are worth.  They will be of some use; because, however blinded I may be by prejudice  or perversity, my prejudices in this matter are not those which blind  the British patriot, and therefore I am fairly sure to see some things  that have not yet struck him.    And first, I do not see this war as one which has welded Governments and  peoples into complete and sympathetic solidarity as against the common  enemy. I see the people of England united in a fierce detestation and  defiance of the views and acts of Prussian Junkerism. And I see the  German people stirred to the depths by a similar antipathy to English  Junkerism, and anger at the apparent treachery and duplicity of the  attack made on them by us in their extremest peril from France and  Russia. I see both nations duped, but alas! not quite unwillingly duped,  by their Junkers and Militarists into wreaking on one another the wrath  they should have spent in destroying Junkerism and Militarism in their  own country. And I see the Junkers and Militarists of England and  Germany jumping at the chance they have longed for in vain for many  years of smashing one another and establishing their own oligarchy as  the dominant military power in the world. No doubt the heroic remedy for  this tragic misunderstanding is that both armies should shoot their  officers and go home to gather in their harvests in the villages and  make a revolution in the towns; and though this is not at present a  practicable solution, it must be frankly mentioned, because it or  something like it is always a possibility in a defeated conscript army  if its commanders push it beyond human endurance when its eyes are  opening to the fact that in murdering its neighbours it is biting off  its nose to vex its face, besides riveting the intolerable yoke of  Militarism and Junkerism more tightly than ever on its own neck. But  there is no chance--or, as our Junkers would put it, no danger--of our  soldiers yielding to such an ecstasy of common sense. They have enlisted  voluntarily; they are not defeated nor likely to be; their  communications are intact and their meals reasonably punctual; they are  as pugnacious as their officers; and in fighting Prussia they are  fighting a more deliberate, conscious, tyrannical, personally insolent,  and dangerous Militarism than their own. Still, even for a voluntary  professional army, that possibility exists, just as for the civilian  there is a limit beyond which taxation, bankruptcy, privation, terror,  and inconvenience cannot be pushed without revolution or a social  dissolution more ruinous than submission to conquest. I mention all  this, not to make myself wantonly disagreeable, but because military  persons, thinking naturally that there is nothing like leather, are now  talking of this war as likely to become a permanent institution like the  Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's, forgetting, I think, that the  rate of consumption maintained by modern military operations is much  greater relatively to the highest possible rate of production  maintainable under the restrictions of war time than it has ever been  before.      *The Day of Judgment.*    The European settlement at the end of the war will be effected, let us  hope, not by a regimental mess of fire-eaters sitting around an up-ended  drum in a vanquished Berlin or Vienna, but by some sort of Congress in  which all the Powers (including, very importantly, the United States of  America) will be represented. Now I foresee a certain danger of our  being taken by surprise at that Congress, and making ourselves  unnecessarily difficult and unreasonable, by presenting ourselves to it  in the character of Injured Innocence. We shall not be accepted in that  character. Such a Congress will most certainly regard us as being, next  to the Prussians (if it makes even that exception), the most quarrelsome  people in the universe. I am quite conscious of the surprise and scandal  this anticipation may cause among my more highminded (_hochnaesig_, the  Germans call it) readers. Let me therefore break it gently by  expatiating for a while on the subject of Junkerism and Militarism  generally, and on the history of the literary propaganda of war between  England and Potsdam which has been going on openly for the last forty  years on both sides. I beg the patience of my readers during this  painful operation. If it becomes unbearable, they can always put the  paper down and relieve themselves by calling the Kaiser Attila and Mr.  Keir Hardie a traitor twenty times or so. Then they will feel, I hope,  refreshed enough to resume. For, after all, abusing the Kaiser or Keir  Hardie or me will not hurt the Germans, whereas a clearer view of the  political situation will certainly help us. Besides, I do not believe  that the trueborn Englishman in his secret soul relishes the pose of  Injured Innocence any more than I do myself. He puts it on only because  he is told that it is respectable.      *Junkers All.*    What is a Junker? Is it a German officer of twenty-three, with offensive  manners, and a habit of cutting down innocent civilians with his sabre?  Sometimes; but not at all exclusively that or anything like that. Let us  resort to the dictionary. I turn to the _Encyclopaedisches Woerterbuch_  of Muret Sanders. Excuse its quaint German-English.    *Junker* = Young nobleman, younker, lording, country squire, country  gentleman, squirearch. *Junkerberrschaft* = squirearchy, landocracy.  *Junkerleben* = life of a country gentleman, (_figuratively_) a jolly  life. *Junkerpartei* = country party. *Junkerwirtschaft* = doings of the  country party.    Thus we see that the Junker is by no means peculiar to Prussia. We may  claim to produce the article in a perfection that may well make Germany  despair of ever surpassing us in that line. Sir Edward Grey is a Junker  from his topmost hair to the tips of his toes; and Sir Edward is a  charming man, incapable of cutting down even an Opposition front  bencher, or of telling a German he intends to have him shot. Lord Cromer  is a Junker. Mr. Winston Churchill is an odd and not disagreeable  compound of Junker and Yankee: his frank anti-German pugnacity is  enormously more popular than the moral babble (Milton's phrase) of his  sanctimonious colleagues. He is a bumptious and jolly Junker, just as  Lord Curzon is an uppish Junker. I need not string out the list. In  these islands the Junker is literally all over the shop.    It is very difficult for anyone who is not either a Junker or a  successful barrister to get into an English Cabinet, no matter which  party is in power, or to avoid resigning when we strike up the drum. The  Foreign Office is a Junker Club. Our governing classes are  overwhelmingly Junker: all who are not Junkers are riff-raff whose only  claim to their position is the possession of ability of some sort:  mostly ability to make money. And, of course, the Kaiser is a Junker,  though less true-blue than the Crown Prince, and much less autocratic  than Sir Edward Grey, who, without consulting us, sends us to war by a  word to an ambassador and pledges all our wealth to his foreign allies  by a stroke of his pen.      *What Is a Militarist?*    Now that we know what a Junker is, let us have a look at the  Militarists. A Militarist is a person who believes that all real power  is the power to kill, and that Providence is on the side of the big  battalions. The most famous Militarist at present, thanks to the zeal  with which we have bought and quoted his book, is General Friedrich von  Bernhardi. But we cannot allow the General to take precedence of our own  writers as a Militarist propagandist. I am old enough to remember the  beginning of the anti-German phase of that very ancient propaganda in  England. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 left Europe very much  taken aback. Up to that date nobody was afraid of Prussia, though  everybody was a little afraid of France; and we were keeping \"buffer  States\" between ourselves and Russia in the east. Germany had indeed  beaten Denmark; but then Denmark was a little State, and was abandoned  in her hour of need by those who should have helped her, to the great  indignation of Ibsen. Germany had also beaten Austria; but somehow  everybody seems able to beat Austria, though nobody seems able to draw  the moral that defeats do not matter as much as the Militarists think,  Austria being as important as ever. Suddenly Germany beat France right  down into the dust, by the exercise of an organized efficiency in war of  which nobody up to then had any conception. There was not a State in  Europe that did not say to itself: \"Good Heavens! what would happen if  she attacked _us_?\" We in England thought of our old-fashioned army and  our old-fashioned commander George Ranger (of Cambridge), and our War  Office with its Crimean tradition of imbecility; and we shook in our  shoes. But we were not such fools as to leave"]]]
