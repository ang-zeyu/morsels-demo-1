On  their speedy arrival in England perhaps hinged our fate; by hastening our  supplies to us.    On the 20th of July, the 'Supply' sailed for Norfolk Island, and returned  to us on the 26th of August; bringing no material news, except that the  soil was found to suit grain, and other seeds, which had been sown in it,  and that a species of flax-plant was discovered to grow spontaneously on  the island.    A survey of the harbour of Port Jackson was now undertaken, in order to  compute the number of canoes, and inhabitants, which it might contain:  sixty-seven canoes, and 147 people were counted. No estimate, however, of  even tolerable accuracy, can be drawn from so imperfect a datum; though it  was perhaps the best in our power to acquire.    In July and August, we experienced more inclement tempestuous weather  than had been observed at any former period of equal duration. And yet  it deserves to be remarked, in honour of the climate, that, although our  number of people exceeded 900, not a single death happened in the latter  month.    The dread of want in a country destitute of natural resource is ever  peculiarly terrible. We had long turned our eyes with impatience towards  the sea, cheered by the hope of seeing supplies from England approach. But  none arriving, on the 2d of October the 'Sirius' sailed for the Cape of  Good Hope, with directions to purchase provisions there, for the use of our  garrison.    A new settlement, named by the governor Rose Hill, 16 miles inland, was  established on the 3d of November, the soil here being judged better  than that around Sydney. A small redoubt was thrown up, and a captain's  detachment posted in it, to protect the convicts who were employed to  cultivate the ground.    The two last of the transports left us for England on the 19th of November,  intending to make their passage by Cape Horn. There now remained with us  only the 'Supply'. Sequestered and cut off as we were from the rest of  civilized nature, their absence carried the effect of desolation. About  this time a convict, of the name of Daly, was hanged, for a burglary:  this culprit, who was a notorious thief and impostor, was the author of a  discovery of a gold mine, a few months before: a composition resembling  ore mingled with earth, which he pretended to have brought from it, he  produced. After a number of attendant circumstances, too ludicrous and  contemptible to relate, which befell a party, who were sent under his  guidance to explore this second Peru, he at last confessed, that he had  broken up an old pair of buckles, and mixed the pieces with sand and stone;  and on assaying the composition, the brass was detected. The fate of this  fellow I should not deem worth recording, did it not lead to the following  observation, that the utmost circumspection is necessary to prevent  imposition, in those who give accounts of what they see in unknown  countries. We found the convicts particularly happy in fertility of  invention, and exaggerated descriptions. Hence large fresh water rivers,  valuable ores, and quarries of limestone, chalk, and marble, were daily  proclaimed soon after we had landed. At first we hearkened with avidity  to such accounts; but perpetual disappointments taught us to listen with  caution, and to believe from demonstration only.    Unabated animosity continued to prevail between the natives and us:  in addition to former losses, a soldier and several convicts suddenly  disappeared, and were never afterwards heard of. Three convicts were also  wounded, and one killed by them, near Botany Bay: similar to the vindictive  spirit which Mr. Cook found to exist among their countrymen at Endeavour  River, they more than once attempted to set fire to combustible matter, in  order to annoy us. Early on the morning of the 18th of December, word was  brought that they were assembled in force, near the brick-kilns, which  stand but a mile from the town of Sydney. The terror of those who brought  the first intelligence magnified the number to two thousand; a second  messenger diminished it to four hundred. A detachment, under the command  of an officer was ordered to march immediately, and reconnoitre them. The  officer soon returned, and reported, that about fifty Indians had appeared  at the brick-kilns; but upon the convicts, who were at work there, pointing  their spades and shovels at them, in the manner of guns, they had fled into  the woods.    Tired of this state of petty warfare and endless uncertainty, the governor  at length determined to adopt a decisive measure, by capturing some of  them, and retaining them by force; which we supposed would either inflame  the rest to signal vengeance, in which case we should know the worst, and  provide accordingly: or else it would induce an intercourse, by the report  which our prisoners would make of the mildness and indulgence with which we  used them. And farther, it promised to unveil the cause of their mysterious  conduct, by putting us in possession of their reasons for harassing and  destroying our people, in the manner I have related. Boats were accordingly  ordered to be got ready, and every preparation made, which could lead to  the attainment of our object.    But as this subject deserves to be particularly detailed, I shall,  notwithstanding its being just within the period of time which this chapter  professes to comprise, allot it a separate place, in the beginning of the  next.    Nor can I close this part of my work without congratulating both the reader  and the author. New matter now presents itself. A considerable part of the  foregoing chapters had been related before, either by others or myself.  I was however, unavoidably compelled to insert it, in order to preserve  unbroken that chain of detail, and perspicuity of arrangement, at which  books professing to convey information should especially aim.          CHAPTER III.        Transactions of the Colony, from the Commencement of the Year 1789, until  the End of March.      Pursuant to his resolution, the governor on the 31st of December sent two  boats, under the command of Lieutenant Ball of the 'Supply', and Lieutenant  George Johnston of the marines, down the harbour, with directions to those  officers to seize and carry off some of the natives. The boats proceeded to  Manly Cove, where several Indians were seen standing on the beach, who  were enticed by courteous behaviour and a few presents to enter into  conversation. A proper opportunity being presented, our people rushed  in among them, and seized two men: the rest fled; but the cries of the  captives soon brought them back, with many others, to their rescue: and so  desperate were their struggles, that, in spite of every effort on our side,  only one of them was secured; the other effected his escape. The boats put  off without delay; and an attack from the shore instantly commenced: they  threw spears, stones, firebrands, and whatever else presented itself, at  the boats; nor did they retreat, agreeable to their former custom, until  many musquets were fired over them.    The prisoner was now fastened by ropes to the thwarts of the boat; and when  he saw himself irretrievably disparted from his countrymen, set up the  most piercing and lamentable cries of distress. His grief, however, soon  diminished: he accepted and ate of some broiled fish which was given to  him, and sullenly submitted to his destiny.    When the news of his arrival at Sydney was announced, I went with every  other person to see him: he appeared to be about thirty years old,  not tall, but robustly made; and of a countenance which, under happier  circumstances, I thought would display manliness and sensibility; his  agitation was excessive, and the clamourous crowds who flocked around  him did not contribute to lessen it. Curiosity and observation seemed,  nevertheless, not to have wholly deserted him; he shewed the effect of  novelty upon ignorance; he wondered at all he saw: though broken and  interrupted with dismay, his voice was soft and musical, when its natural  tone could be heard; and he readily pronounced with tolerable accuracy  the names of things which were taught him. To our ladies he quickly became  extraordinarily courteous, a sure sign that his terror was wearing off.    Every blandishment was used to soothe him, and it had its effect. As he  was entering the governor's house, some one touched a small bell which hung  over the door: he started with horror and astonishment; but in a moment  after was reconciled to the noise, and laughed at the cause of his  perturbation. When pictures were shown to him, he knew directly those which  represented the human figure: among others, a very large handsome print of  her royal highness the Dutchess of Cumberland being produced, he called out  'woman', a name by which we had just before taught him to call the female  convicts. Plates of birds and beasts were also laid before him; and many  people were led to believe, that such as he spoke about and pointed to  were known to him. But this must have been an erroneous conjecture, for the  elephant, rhinoceros, and several others, which we must have discovered did  they exist in the country, were of the number. Again, on the other hand,  those he did not point out, were equally unknown to him.    His curiosity here being satiated, we took him to a large brick house,  which was building for the governor's residence: being about to enter, he  cast up his eyes, and seeing some people leaning out of a window on  the first story, he exclaimed aloud, and testified the most extravagant  surprise. Nothing here was observed to fix his attention so strongly as  some tame fowls, who were feeding near him: our dogs also he particularly  noticed; but seemed more fearful than fond of them.    He dined at a side-table at the governor's; and ate heartily of fish and  ducks, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#2)"],[1,"incidents are pointed out with a sincere belief in their  historical verity. The dramatic powers manifested in his novels, have  been still more largely displayed in his _Norman Maurice_, a play of  singular originality, in design, character, and execution, the nervous  language and felicitous turns of expression in which remind us of the  best of the old dramatists. We have heretofore expressed in the  _International_ a conviction that Norman Maurice is the best American  drama that has yet been published--the most American, the most dramatic,  the most original.    As a member of the Legislature of his native State, and on various  public occasions, Mr. Simms has vindicated a title to fame as an orator;  and a recent nomination for the presidency of the South Carolina  College, although he declined being a candidate, is an evidence of the  impression which his ability, information, and high character have  produced on his fellow citizens.    His intense intellectual activity, united with a habitually reflective  and philosophical mode of thought, and unwearied laboriousness, enable  him to accomplish an almost incredible amount of literary labor. The  catalogue of his works which is subjoined, gives but an inadequate idea  of what he has really performed; for multifarious productions, many of  them of the highest order in their respective classes, are scattered in  the pages of periodicals, or still in manuscript; while the unceasing  demands on his pen, with his arduous editorship, prevent him from  accomplishing many fruitful designs, whose inception he has hinted in  various ways. To his intellectual gifts, he unites a brave, generous  nature, a kindly, and strong heart, a genial, impulsive, yet faithful  and determined disposition, warm affection and friendship, a spirit to  do and to endure, and a soul as much elevated above the petty envies and  jealousies which too often deform the _genus irritabile_, as it is in  large sympathy with the beautiful, the true, the just--with humanity and  with nature.

[Illustration: PETERSON & HUMPHREY'S CARPET HOUSE.]      It were well if not only William B. Astor, Stephen Whitney, the heirs of  Peter Stuyvesant (of blessed memory), and others who own real estate in  this city, and likewise all mayors, common councilmen, and others in  authority, were endued with more taste, with a higher regard to the  general interest, and a juster sense of the matters that pertain to a  good administration, so that it might be said in after times that the  beneficence of the Creator (who in things natural has done more for ours  than for any other city), had been seconded by the pious wisdom of the  creature, and Manhattan pointed to as in all respects the metropolis of  the world. Why not? If the very stones in the streets of London, Paris,  and Vienna, were turned to pure gold, they would not purchase for those  cities advantages that should be compared with such as we already  possessed by our beautiful island--a giant mosaic, set in emerald,  studding the bosom of Nature.    Whatever may be said by our excellent neighbor, the minister of the  dingy-looking red brick meeting-house round the corner, it is not less a  work of piety to create any work of beauty--a beautiful house, or shop,  or poem, for example--than to teach a class in the Sunday school,--which  doctrine may be incidentally fortified from Jonathan Edwards's Theory of  True Virtue, and more directly from the best philosophies of later  years. It is ordered that the dignity of human nature shall in a great  degree be dependent upon a sympathetic association with what is  admirable. It was Hazlitt, we believe,--certainly it was some one who  appreciatingly recognized the highest earthly ministry,--who said it was  impossible to entertain an angry feeling in the presence of a lovely  woman's portrait,--which, done fitly, is the highest accomplishment of  art. Whatever is beautiful or sublime has the same purifying and  ennobling tendency. The beggars do shrewdly who sit in _front_ of  Stewart's. The same person who would give a shilling there, would as  likely as not steal a penny from the hat of the blind man round the  corner, where those detestable red bricks so outrage every principle  known to a builder fit to handle the trowel. There is nothing more  offensive than this custom of making of different materials the various  fronts of the same edifice. It may be allowable to construct the _rear_  of a house, or a side that is to be built against speedily, of a cheaper  stone; but to make the face upon one street of marble, and the face  around the corner of brick, as in the case of Stewart's store, and the  Society Library, is an outrage as ridiculous as it would be to make  alternate gores of a woman's skirt of Petersham and Brussels lace.  Bricks are very respectable; we say nothing in their dispraise; but to  any man of taste, an edifice is much more beautiful built entirely of  bricks than it is with but one of two exposed parts of marble; and let  us say to the affluent merchant to whom New-York is indebted for the  structure just mentioned, that until he paints his bricks on  Reade-street, so that they correspond as nearly as may be with his  fronts on Chambers-street and Broadway, his store will indicate but a  shabby gentility, an unnatural association of tow cloth and satin,  copper and silver, poverty and riches, which should blush in the face of  the most inferior exhibition of consistency. With the abolition of this  strong contrast, the observer who goes down Broadway will contemplate  with delight the classical air of this most imposing Palace of"]]]
