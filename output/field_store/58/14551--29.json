Type from Providencia Mines,    Sonora, Mexico.    _Type locality._--Barranca Ibarra, Jalisco, Mexico.    _Range._--Central Arizona south to Jalisco and including the southern  half of Baja California. Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield, _op.  cit._: 261, unless otherwise indicated) are: _Arizona_: Camp Verde;  Fort Bowie. _Sonora_: Pilares (Burt, Miscl. Publ., Mus. Zool., Univ.  Michigan, 39:24, 1938). _Jalisco_: Barranca Ibarra (Miller, orig.  descr.). _Baja California_: Miraflores; San Ignacio. _Arizona_: Bates  Well.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; total length, 67.1(60-72);  tibia, 11.3(10.1-12.3); forearm, 28.4(26.3-30.0); greatest length of  skull, 11.7(11.3-12.0); breadth of braincase, 6.1(5.9-6.3). Color:  between Cinnamon Drab and Drab, dorsally; Wood Brown to Light Drab,  ventrally (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:260).    _Remarks._--Hatfield (_op. cit._) examined no specimens from Mexico  (Baja California excepted) and Burt (_op. cit._) who did examine some  specimens (from Sonora), referred one from northwestern Sonora to _P.  h. hesperus_ and those from northeastern Sonora to _P. h. merriami_.  Since our treatment of subspecies of _Pipistrellus_ (_P. s. veracrucis_  excepted) aims merely to reflect the latest systematic treatment  accorded the animals, we would follow Burt (_op. cit._) were it not  for the fact that he shows the geographic range of _P. h. merriami_  separated by the range of _P. h. hesperus_ into two parts. This is  inconsistent with the ordinarily accepted concept of subspecies.  Consequently, we have followed Hatfield (_op. cit._). Clearly, a  critical study is needed of adequate material of _Pipistrellus  hesperus_ of Mexico.      +Pipistrellus hesperus maximus+ Hatfield      _Pipistrellus hesperus maximus_ Hatfield, Jour. Mamm., 17:261,    August 14, 1936.    _Type locality._--Dog Spring, Hidalgo County, New Mexico.    _Range._--Southern New Mexico, western Texas and probably the  adjoining parts of Mexico. Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield [_op.  cit._:261] except as otherwise indicated) are: _New Mexico_: Animas  Valley; Florida Mountains; Carlsbad Cave. _Texas_: Mouth of Pecos  River (Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 25:210, 1905); Boquillas (Borell and  Bryant, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 48:9, 1942); Glen Spring (Borell  and Bryant, _loc. cit._).    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; total length, 80.3(78-83);  tibia, 12.3(11.7-13.1); forearm, 32.9(31.8-33.3); greatest length of  skull, 12.7(12.3-12.9); breadth of braincase, 6.6(6.5-6.7). Color  between Smoke Gray and Pale Drab (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:261).      +Pipistrellus hesperus santarosae+ Hatfield      _Pipistrellus hesperus santarosae_ Hatfield, Jour. Mamm., 17:261,    August 14, 1936.    _Type locality._--Santa Rosa, Guadalupe County, New Mexico.    _Range._--New Mexico (excepting southern part) and western Colorado.  Marginal occurrences (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:262) are: _Colorado_:  Bedrock. _New Mexico_: Santa Rosa; Socorro; Laguna.    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; total length, 82.0(80-86);  tibia, 12.4(11.9-13.0); forearm, 32.8(31.7-34.1); greatest length of  skull, 12.7(12.3-13.1); breadth of braincase, 6.6(6.3-6.8). Color  between Buffy Brown and Wood Brown (after Hatfield, _op. cit._:261,  262).      +Pipistrellus subflavus+    (Synonomy under subspecies)    _Range._--Canadian to Tropical life-zones of eastern North America  from Quebec southward to Honduras.    _Characters._--Sayal Brown to darker than Mummy Brown, dorsally; total  length, 73-89; foot more than half as long as tibia; tragus tapering  and straight; dorsal profile of skull convex in interorbital region;  inner upper incisor bicuspidate; outer upper incisor unicuspidate  (lacking accessory cusp on anterointernal face); P1 viewed from  occlusal face more than a seventh of area of canine and visible from  labial aspect; lower, third premolar as high as anterior cusp of  canine; lower premolars less crowded than in _P. hesperus_ and  distance between canine and first molar less than length of second  lower molar.    _Remarks._--In winter this species hibernates in caves in clusters of  fewer than fifty individuals, but in summer fewer of the bats live  there and at this season some have been captured as far as thirty  miles from any such retreat suggesting that the bats inhabit other  types of shelter. The wide range of this species in respect to  life-zones is noteworthy; it occurs in the Canadian Life-zone (Joliet,  Quebec), the Tropical Life-zone (30 km. SSE Jesus Carranza, Veracruz)  and in the intervening life-zones.    The longer thumb of this species, in comparison with that of  _Pipistrellus hesperus_, was verified by measuring the thumb including  its claw and the pad at the base of the thumb in 12 _P. s. veracrucis_  and 10 _P. h. maximus_. In _veracrucis_ the mean was 5.9 millimeters  and the extremes were 5.5 and 6.4. In _maximus_ the corresponding  figures were 3.9, 3.6 and 4.3.      +Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus+ (F.

Never before had he seen such a sight, for, we must  remember, he was born far inland.                      [Illustration: HAYDN ON CALAIS BOAT]    Most men do their best work in their younger years, but in Haydn's later  years he wrote two of his greatest works: _The Creation_ and _The  Seasons_. _The Creation_ is loved by all people. It is one of a group of  favorite oratorios which have found a warm place in the hearts of the  people. With it stand _The Messiah_, _Judas Maccabaeus_, _St. Paul_ and  _Elijah_. Do you know who composed each of these?    After the English journeys, Haydn lived quietly in Vienna in what is now  known as the Haydn house. Should you ever go to Vienna you will be  welcomed there by the caretaker, who will show you the rooms in which  Haydn lived.    One day toward the end of his life he asked his servant to carry him to  the piano. While the members of his household stood near him he played  three times, very solemnly, the _Emperor's Song_.                       [Illustration: THE EMPEROR'S SONG]    This is the way Haydn wrote his name--                                 [Illustration]                               FACTS ABOUT FRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN      When you have read this page and the next make a story about Haydn's  life.
