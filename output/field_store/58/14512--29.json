This  should be mounted in a wooden handle. _e_ and _f_ are carbon cones. A  thin rubber tube is also useful; it may be attached to the work and  serve as a blowing tube, thus obviating the necessity of moving the work  to the mouth when internal air pressure is to be applied. In order to  avoid undue repetition, the uses of these tools and appliances will be  described as they occur.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    Glass, as usually supplied by chemical apparatus dealers is of the  composition known as \"soda-glass.\" They also supply \"hard\" or  \"combustion\" glass, but this is only used for special purposes, as it is  too infusible for convenient working in the ordinary blowpipe flame.    Soda-glass consists primarily of silicate of sodium with smaller  quantities of silicate of aluminum and potassium. Its exact composition  varies. It is not blackened, as lead glass is, by exposure to the  reducing gases which are present in the blue cone of a blowpipe flame,  and hence is easier for a beginner to work without producing  discolouration.    Further notes on glasses will be found on page 55, but for ordinary  purposes soda-glass will probably be used.

Perhaps the most common need of the glass-blower whose work is connected  with that of the laboratory is for a sealed tube; and the sealing of a  tube is an excellent preliminary exercise in glass-blowing.    We will assume that the student has adjusted the blowpipe to give a  flame similar to that shown in _d_, Fig. 1, and that he has learned to  maintain a steady blast of air with the bellows; further, we will assume  that the tube he wishes to seal is of moderate size, say not more than  half an inch in diameter and with walls of from one-tenth to one-fifth  of an inch thick.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    A convenient length of tube for the first trial is about one foot; this  should be cut off from the longer piece, in which it is usually  supplied, as follows:--lay the tube on a flat surface and make a deep  cut with the edge of a file. Do not \"saw\" the file to and fro over the  glass. If the file edge has been ground as shown in _a_, Fig. 3, such a  procedure will be quite unnecessary and only involve undue wear; one  movement with sufficient pressure to make the file \"bite\" will give a  deep cut. Now rotate the tube through about one-eighth of a turn and  make another cut in continuation of the first. Take the tube in the  hands, as shown in _a_, Fig. 4, and apply pressure with the thumbs, at  the same time straining at the ends. The tube should break easily. If it  does not, do not strain too hard, as it may shatter and cause serious  injuries to the hands, but repeat the operation with the file and so  deepen the original cuts. In holding a tube for breaking, it is  important to place the hands as shown in sketch, as this method is least  likely to cause shattering and also minimises the risk of injury even if  the tube should shatter. To cut a large tube, or one having very thick  walls, it is better to avoid straining altogether and to break by  applying a small bead of intensely heated glass to the file cut. If the  walls are very thin, a glass-blower's knife should be used instead of a  file. The tube and glass-blower's knife should be held in the hand, and  the tube rotated against the edge of the knife; this will not produce a  deep cut, but is less likely to break the tube. A bead of hot glass  should be used to complete the work.    The next operation is to heat the glass tube in the middle; this must be  done gradually and evenly; that is to say the tube must be rotated  during heating and held some considerable distance in front of the flame  at first; otherwise the outer surface of the glass will expand before  the interior is affected and the tube will break. From two to five  minutes, heating at a distance of about eight inches in front of the  flame will be found sufficient in most cases, and another minute should  be taken in bringing the tube into the flame. Gradual heating is  important, but even heating is still more important and this can only be  obtained by uniform and steady rotation. Until the student can rotate a  tube steadily _without thinking about it_, real progress in  glass-blowing is impossible.    When the tube is in the flame it must be held just in front of the blue  cone and rotated until the glass is soft enough to permit the ends to be  drawn apart. Continue to separate the ends and, at the same time, move  the tube very slightly along its own axis, so that the flame tends to  play a little more on the thicker part than on the drawn-out portion. If  this is done carefully, the drawn-out portion can be separated off,  leaving only a slight \"bleb\" on the portion it is desired to seal. This  is illustrated by _b_, Fig. 4.    To convert the seal at _b_, Fig. 4., into the ordinary form of test-tube  seal, it is only necessary to heat the \"bleb\" a little more strongly,  blow gently into the tube until the thick portion is slightly expanded,  re-heat the whole of the rounded end until it is beginning to collapse,  and give a final shaping by careful blowing after it has commenced to  cool. In each case the glass must be removed from the flame before  blowing. The finished seal is shown by _c_, Fig. 4. If desired, the open  end may now be finished by heating and rotating the soft glass against  the large turn-pin, as illustrated in _d_, but the turn-pin must not be  allowed to become too hot, as if this happens it will stick to the  glass. After turning out the end, the lip of glass must be heated to  redness and allowed to cool without coming in contact with anything;  otherwise it will be in a condition of strain and liable to crack  spontaneously. The finished test-tube is shown by _e_.    When it is necessary to seal a substance inside a glass tube, the bottom  of the tube is first closed, as explained above, and allowed to cool;  the substance, if a solid, is now introduced, but should not come to  within less than two inches of the point where the second seal is to be  made. If the substance is a liquid it can more conveniently be  introduced at a later stage.    Now bring the tube into the blowpipe flame gradually, and rotate it,  while heating, at the place where it is to be closed. Allow the glass to  soften and commence to run together until the diameter of the tube is  reduced to about half its original size. Remove from the flame and draw  the ends apart, this should give a long, thick extension as shown by  _f_, Fig. 4. If any liquid is to be introduced, it may now be done by  inserting a thin rubber or other tube through the opening and running  the liquid in. A glass tube should be used with caution for introducing  the liquid, as any hard substance will tend to scratch the inside of the  glass and cause cracking. The final closure is made by melting the  drawn-out extension in the blowpipe flame; the finished seal being shown  by _g_, Fig. 4.    If the sealed tube has to stand internal pressure, it is desirable to  allow the glass to thicken somewhat more before drawing out, and the  bottom seal should also be made thicker. For such a tube, and especially  when it has to stand heating, as in a Carius determination of chlorine,  each seal should be cooled very slowly by rotating it in a gas flame  until the surface is covered with a thick layer of soot, and it should  then be placed aside in a position where the hot glass will not come in  contact with anything, and where it will be screened from all draughts.    _Joining Tube._--We will now consider the various forms of join in glass  tubing which are met with in the laboratory. First, as being easiest, we  will deal with the end-to-end joining of two tubes of similar glass.  _a_, _b_, and _c_, Fig. 5, illustrate this. One end of one of the tubes  should be closed, a lip should be turned out on each of the ends to be  joined, and both lips heated simultaneously until the glass is  thoroughly soft. Now bring the lips together gently, until they are in  contact at all points and there are no places at which air can escape;  remove from the flame, and blow slowly and very cautiously until the  joint is expanded as shown in _b_, Fig. 5. Reheat in the flame until  the glass has run down to rather less than the original diameter of the  tube, and give a final shaping by re-blowing. The chief factors of  success in making such a join are, thorough heating of the glass before  bringing the two tubes together, and avoidance of hard or sudden blowing  when expanding the joint. The finished work is shown by _c_, Fig. 5.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    To join a small glass tube to the end of a large one, the large tube  should first be sealed, a small spot on the extreme end of the seal  heated, and air pressure used to expand the heated spot as shown in _d_.  This expanded spot is then re-heated and blown out until it bursts as  shown in _e_, the thin fragments of glass are removed and the end of the  small tube turned out as shown in _f_. After this the procedure is  similar to that used in jointing two tubes of equal size.    When these two forms of joint have been mastered, a T piece will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],[0,"The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#2)"],[1,"flame about 4-5 cm. in length. If the tip of the blowpipe be held  outside of the Bunsen flame, and the pressure of the stream of air be  diminished, we obtain a reducing flame.      ~Supports.~--For supports, charcoal, platinum, and glass are chiefly used.  The charcoal should be made from some light wood, such as alder. It  should be well burnt, and should not scintillate or smoke.    The platinum supports are generally in the form of wire and foil.  Platinum-tipped forceps are frequently employed in blowpipe analysis.    Glass is used in the form of tubing.    Hard glass tubing, 3 mm. bore, is drawn off into ignition tubes 7-8 cm.  in length. Several dozen of these tubes should be made before commencing  the tests of the next chapter.      ~Apparatus.~--A small agate mortar, 4-5 cm. in diameter, should be  provided in which to grind the samples to be examined.    The pestle, which should also be of agate, must be adapted to the  mortar in shape and size.    Two pairs of forceps will also be needed.    One pair should be of steel, and the other pair of brass, with fine  points.    Of other apparatus, the most necessary is:--        A small hammer and anvil.        Two three-cornered files.        Small piece of cobalt glass, about 5 x 10 cm.        Pocket magnifying lens.        Several small watch glasses--for metallic beads, etc.      ~Chemicals.~--A list of the principal chemicals is here given:--        Sodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}.        Borax, Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} + 10 H_{2}O.        Microcosmic salt, (HNaNH_{4}), PO_{4} + 8 H_{2}O.        Cobalt nitrate, Co(NO_{3})_{2} + 5 H_{2}O.        Potassium cyanide, KCN.        Hydrochloric acid, (dilute), HCl + nH_{2}O.        Litmus paper, red and blue.        Brazil-wood paper.    Any other special reagents which may be needed will be mentioned as  required.          CHAPTER II    GENERAL OUTLINE OF BLOWPIPE ANALYSIS           [ABBREVIATIONS: O. F. for oxidizing flame, R. F. for       reducing flame, Ch. for charcoal, Ct. for coating, Bp. for       blowpipe.]    In order to examine a substance before the blowpipe to determine the  presence or absence of certain elements, it becomes necessary to arrange  a systematic method. As with all branches of chemical work, one's  success is largely dependent upon neatness of manipulation and  carefulness of observation.    The following order of observation is essentially that given by  Berzelius:--         1. Examination on charcoal by itself.         2. Examination on charcoal with Na_{2}CO_{3}.         3. Examination in ignition tube with Na_{2}CO_{3} and       charcoal.         4. Examination on platinum wire.         5. Examination in borax bead.         6. Examination with Co(NO_{3})_{2}.    After having examined a body in these six different ways, we shall be  able to say what are its principal constituents.    Before describing the method of carrying out these six different  operations, it will be necessary to give a few definitions of terms  which we shall have frequent occasion to employ.      ~Definitions.~--_Ignition_ is the heating of a substance to a high  temperature.    _Fusion_ is the heating of a substance to the melting-point.    _Intumescence_ is the swelling of the substance upon heating.    _Decrepitation_ is the crackling of a substance due to the sudden  expansion of combined water upon heating.    _Deflagration_ is the burning of a substance with explosive violence,  generally due to excess of oxygen.    _Incandescence_ is the white light emitted by a substance that is  infusible when subjected to a high temperature.      ~Examination on Charcoal alone.~--The size of the assay should be about  that of a mustard seed. This is sufficiently large to show all of the  reactions clearly, and though a larger piece would exhibit the  characteristic phenomena, yet much more effort is required. A very  small, shallow hole should be cut in the Ch. to receive the assay. The  Bp. flame should be directed at an angle of about 30 deg. with the  surface of the Ch. Considerable care must be taken lest the hole in the  Ch. is burned too deep and the assay lost in the coal.    The force of the air from the jet must also be borne in mind for a  strong blast, or sudden puffs may blow the substance away.    The following changes are to be looked for:--    _a._ Whether the substance is volatile or non-volatile.    _Illustrations._ Examine before the Bp. on Ch. some arsenious oxide,  As_{2}O_{3}, also some alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}.    _b._ Whether the substance is fusible or infusible.    _Illustrations._ Examine before the Bp. on Ch. some silver oxide, AgO,  also some zinc oxide, ZnO.    _c._ Whether the substance is alkaline or non-alkaline when placed upon  moistened red litmus.    _Illustrations._ Ignite some calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}, before the Bp.  on Ch., and place residue on moistened red litmus. In like manner,  examine some magnesium carbonate, MgCO_{3}.    _d._ Color of coating on Ch. caused by combination of metal and oxygen  due to heat of Bp. flame.    _Illustrations._ Examine some oxide of lead, PbO, before the Bp. on Ch.,  also some oxide of cadmium, CdO.    _e._ Decrepitation.    _Illustration._ Examine some sodium chloride, NaCl, before the Bp. on  Ch.    _f._ Deflagration.    _Illustrations._ Examine some potassium nitrate, KNO_{3}, before the Bp.  on Ch., also some ammonium nitrate, NH_{4}NO_{3}.    _g._ Intumescence.    _Illustration._ Examine some alum,        K_{2}Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{4},    before the Bp. on Ch.    _h._ Incandescence.    _Illustration._ Examine some oxide of barium, BaO, before the Bp. on Ch.    _i._ Formation of a metallic bead--color and malleability.    _Illustration._ Examine some silver oxide, AgO, before the Bp. on Ch.      ~Examination on Charcoal with Na_{2}CO_{3}.~--Metallic compounds are often  difficult to reduce with the blowpipe flame alone, and hence no bead is  obtained. In order to facilitate reduction and the obtaining of a  metallic bead, the substance in a finely powdered condition is mixed  with four parts of sodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and ignited before  the Bp. on Ch. The metallic compound is decomposed, the metal being  transformed into the carbonate, which in turn, through the agency of the  Ch. and the heat of the flame, is reduced to the free metal. Sometimes  the reduction is made easier by adding to the substance about its own  bulk of potassium cyanide, KCN, which takes up oxygen from the compound  and is converted into potassium cyanate, KCNO.    The reactions in reducing copper sulphate, CuSO_{4}, with Na_{2}CO_{3}  and with KCN before the blowpipe, are here given:--        CuSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CuCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4} }  (1)                2CuCO_{3} + C = 3CO_{2} + 2Cu           }        CuSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CuCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4} }                     CuCO_{3} = CuO + CO_{2}            }  (2)                    CuO + KCN = Cu + KCNO               }    After obtaining beads, it is well to obtain their coatings, for  oftentimes it is only in this way that we can distinguish between the  metals.      ~Examination in Tube with Na_{2}CO_{3} and Charcoal.~--If the substance in  a finely pulverized condition be mixed with twelve parts, Na_{2}CO_{3},  and six parts of charcoal powder and the mixture be placed in an  ignition tube and subjected to heat, the acid of the substance combines  with the soda and the metal is set free.    If this metal is volatile, a sublimate is formed in the upper end of the  tube.    Mercury deposits in minute globules, which may be seen with the  magnifying glass. Arsenic forms a ring, which, when examined with the  magnifying glass, is seen to be made up of minute crystals. Ammonia is  recognized by its characteristic odor, and also by its turning a slip  of moistened red litmus (held over the mouth of the tube) blue.      ~Examination on Platinum Wire.~--Many substances possess the property of  imparting to the colorless flame of the Bunsen burner characteristic  colors.    The chlorides of these substances exhibit these flame reactions best,  and hence before applying the flame tests we dip the wire which serves  as a support into hydrochloric acid and then into the substance. When  the substance has been taken up on the wire, it is placed in the edge of  the long colorless flame of the Bunsen burner near the apex, when  instantly the flame becomes tinged with the characteristic color of the  substance.    _Illustrations._ Sodium compounds color the flame yellow, and a crystal  of potassium dichromate appears colorless in the sodium light.    This sodium reaction is extremely delicate, it being possible to detect  with ease a quantity of a sodium salt less than 1/3000000 of a milligram  in weight.    Potassium colors the flame purplish-violet.    Barium colors the flame apple-green.    Strontium colors the flame crimson.    Calcium colors the flame orange-red, distinguished from strontium, by  appearing gray when seen through blue glass.    Boracic acid colors the flame green when the substance has been  moistened with glycerine.      ~Examination in Borax Bead.~--Borax, Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}, and microcosmic  salt,        NaNH_{4}H . PO_{4},    possess the property of dissolving many of the metallic oxides at the  temperature of the Bunsen flame.    For example, with oxide of cobalt, the following reactions take place  with the two fluxes:--        CoO + Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} = Co(BO_{2})_{2} + 2 NaBO_{2}.    On heating, NaNH_{4}H. PO_{4}, it is decomposed into the metaphosphate  of sodium, NaPO_{3},        CoO + NaPO_{3} = CoNaPO_{4}.    Now in such cases of solution the metallic oxides impart a  characteristic color to the flux.    The platinum wire is the best support,--it is heated to incandescence in  the Bunsen flame, and then is quickly dipped into the borax, when a  small globule will adhere,--this is removed to the flame again when the  borax melts to a clear glassy bead. While the bead is still melted,"]]]
