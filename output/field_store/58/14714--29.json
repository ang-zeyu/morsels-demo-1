The latter veiled their innate  brutality, their blood lust, and their intention to acquire world  domination through brute force, with consummate craftiness.    Miss Finzi gives a graphic account of the troubles that had to be  surmounted, owing to insufficiency of hospital requisites, beds,  medicines, doctors and nurses; but this was inseparable from the nature  of things, and has long since been righted. We may indeed be proud of  our services of mercy; nothing can exceed their value and efficiency,  namely the R.A.M.C and our nurses. If our gallant soldiers and sailors  engaged, through political blunder, in the \"Gallipoli gamble\" and Kut  disaster had been as well tended and supplied as those in France, how  many lives, thrown away through political ineptitude, would now have  been spared to us!    Miss Finzi writes most modestly of her own work, but we know that she  and all the genuine nurses and helpers worked devotedly and well, and  that the deepest debt of gratitude is due from the nation to them, who  softened the horrors of war to our soldiers, who ministered aid to  them when they were sore stricken by wounds or diseases, and mitigated  their tortures. It must not be forgotten that for many months the  capture of Calais seemed not improbable; the Huns had no doubts upon  the subject, and time after time, as in the case of Paris and Verdun,  the bloodthirsty Kaiser gave his vain and arrogant orders: \"_To be  taken at all cost, no matter at what sacrifice!_\" A truly beneficent  ruler and father of his people! The R.A.M.C. and nurses, therefore,  were working at terrible disadvantage, with no certainty that the  bestial and brutish enemy would not shortly appear, to wreak upon  them his savage instincts of murder and lust, signs of which were  constantly brought in to them: terrible wounds caused by expanding  bullets, and, worst of all, accounts by eye-witnesses and victims of  the perpetual and designed firing upon hospitals, dressing stations,  stretcher-bearers, it being, apparently, a craze of the Germans to  kill and ill-treat what is helpless and cannot resist them. Tales  also were related of civil population--men, women and children--being  butchered, and Red Cross nurses outraged in the most fiendish manner,  and then mutilated and murdered. With such possible prospects and fate  at the hands of men compared to whom the Huns of Attila, the Goths of  Alaric, the Tartars of Timur and the Mongols of Genghis Khan deserved  a crown of mercy. Imagine what our nurses are and what blessings they  have brought to our soldiers and sailors. At the commencement of the  Crimean War there were no Army nurses and no civil nurses, except  those dreadful creatures described by Charles Dickens in \"Martin  Chuzzlewit,\" such as Sairey Gamp and Betsy Prig--fat, waddling, coarse,  ignorant, unclean and unkempt, and usually smelling of gin; they  attended births, sick-beds, and laying out of corpses, in which they  took great pride, as it brought them in touch with the undertaker, to  their mutual advantage. Contrast such so-called nurses, in their poke  bonnets, smelly robes and clogs, with their huge, bulging umbrellas,  their noisiness and heavy hands, with those of to-day, with their neat  and serviceable uniform, their gentleness, their light hands, their  kindness and sympathy with their suffering patients. As the late Dean  Hole wrote in his \"Now and Then,\" they might be compared to a beautiful  yacht scudding along in a light breeze, under a blue sky and shining  sun, while the ancient apologies for nurses rolled along, a water- (or  gin and water) logged barge in the Thames in a thick, yellow November  fog. (Dean Hole.)    It was to Florence Nightingale, of ever-blessed memory, that we owe  the foundation of our Army nursing system in 1854. When the news of  the battle of the Alma came, and of many thousands of wounded men  with no nurses and a totally insufficient medical staff, and _not a  single ambulance_, she volunteered to take out a number of nurses.  For a wonder her offer was accepted, for in those days every sort of  change in Army matters was considered a pernicious innovation. She  took out thirty-four nurses to the Crimea, and before long had 10,000  wounded in her charge. The work which she and her nurses did was  marvellous, and they stuck to it till their health broke down, as our  present nurses have done. After the war L50,000 was subscribed for  the purpose of founding an institution for the training of nurses in  connection with St. Thomas's and King's College Hospitals. From that  time the Army nursing system has steadily developed under the practical  and ever-ready patronage of Royalty, till it reached its present  perfection. In the Soudan and South African Wars the services of the  nurses were invaluable. When the present war showed itself to be one  of such gigantic dimensions, and when our Army, due to the genius of  Lord Kitchener, swelled to the size of millions, it was feared that a  sufficient number of Army nurses could not be forthcoming; but then  the women of England showed what they were made of. Hundreds and  thousands devoted themselves at once to training as nurses, others to  the less-skilled work required in hospitals for the victims of war; and  now, owing to them and the admirable chiefs and subordinate officers of  the R.A.M.C, and to the patriotic and self-sacrificing manner in which  private medical practitioners have come forward with their services,  little or nothing is wanted, considering the gigantic nature and scope  of this terrible war.    Miss Finzi is to be congratulated upon having written a most  interesting and readable book, full of facts and personal experiences,  such experiences as, please God, no one will again have to relate; and  this will be so when once the Hohenzollerns, the cause of all trouble  in Europe and elsewhere for many decades, are exterminated or driven  into obscurity.    The work shows forth in bright colours the universal devotion of our  nurses--heroic women who face all dangers and hardships for the sake  of doing good to others. Among these must ever stand forth the name  of Edith Cavell, who spent her whole life in mitigating the sufferings  of others, who nursed even German officers in her hospital who had  probably committed unspeakable crimes and atrocities in Belgium. This  weighed as nothing, as might have been expected, in the eyes of the  barbarous Teutons, to whom mercy, justice and gratitude are unknown.  She was done to death vilely and brutally, but her martyrdom will  never be forgotten or forgiven; it will be one of the foulest of the  many foul stains on the fame of the Kaiser and his accomplices, while  it will ever shed a ray of glory upon the noble record of our British  Nurses.                             ALFRED E. TURNER.          BOOK I    1914    As It Was in the Beginning          CHAPTER I    October, 1914      _October 21st, London._ It was not without a sense of relief that we  watched the hands of the station clock move on to the stroke of six,  heard the train doors slam, and cast a last look at the anxious little  group of friends who clustered round the carriage doors to bid us  farewell and God-speed.    To be quite frank, their cheering savoured somewhat of mourning and  much of admonition.    Were we not the tattered remnants of a once-flourishing Red Cross  detachment, whose energies and equipment alike had been left behind at  the enforced evacuation of Ostend? Were we not about to face all kinds  of undreamed-of perils?    So they whispered to us; but as we relapsed into our seats, to the  accompaniment of a cheery chorus of rag-times from the extensive  repertoire of the recruits in a neighbouring carriage, our hearts beat  hard with trepidation and anticipation of the Great Unknown. After all,  who were we amongst the countless thousands clamouring to \"get out\" to  the scene of action?
