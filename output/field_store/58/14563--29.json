A kitchen clock or a  cheap watch is usually thought of as a machine to tell the \"time of  day,\" but it may be used to time a horse or a bicycler upon a race  course, and then it becomes an instrument to measure the amount of time  required for covering the length of the course. Astronomers use a clock  in both of these ways--to tell the time at which something happens or is  done, and to measure the amount of time required for something; and in  using a clock for either purpose the student should learn to take the  time from it to the nearest second or better, if it has a seconds hand,  or to a small fraction of a minute, by estimating the position of the  minute hand between the minute marks on the dial. Estimate the fraction  in tenths of a minute, not in halves or quarters.    EXERCISE 1.--If several watches are available, let one person tap  sharply upon a desk with a pencil and let each of the others note the  time by the minute hand to the nearest tenth of a minute and record the  observations as follows:        2h. 44.5m.  First tap.   2h. 46.4m.  1.9m.      2h. 44.9m.  Second tap.  2h. 46.7m.  1.8m.      2h. 46.6m.  Third tap.   2h. 48.6m.  2.0m.    The letters h and m are used as abbreviations for hour and minute. The  first and second columns of the table are the record made by one  student, and second and third the record made by another. After all the  observations have been made and recorded they should be brought together  and compared by taking the differences between the times recorded for  each tap, as is shown in the last column. This difference shows how much  faster one watch is than the other, and the agreement or disagreement of  these differences shows the degree of accuracy of the observations. Keep  up this practice until tenths of a minute can be estimated with fair  precision.    2. ANGLES AND THEIR USE.--An angle is the amount of opening or  difference of direction between two lines that cross each other. At  twelve o'clock the hour and minute hand of a watch point in the same  direction and the angle between them is zero. At one o'clock the minute  hand is again at XII, but the hour hand has moved to I, one twelfth part  of the circumference of the dial, and the angle between the hands is one  twelfth of a circumference. It is customary to imagine the circumference  of a dial to be cut up into 360 equal parts--i. e., each minute space of  an ordinary dial to be subdivided into six equal parts, each of which  is called a degree, and the measurement of an angle consists in finding  how many of these degrees are included in the opening between its sides.  At one o'clock the angle between the hands of a watch is thirty degrees,  which is usually written 30°, at three o'clock it is 90°, at six o'clock  180°, etc.    A watch may be used to measure angles. How? But a more convenient  instrument is the protractor, which is shown in Fig. 1, applied to the  angle _A B C_ and showing that _A B C_ = 85° as nearly as the protractor  scale can be read.    The student should have and use a protractor, such as is furnished with  this book, for the numerous exercises which are to follow.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--A protractor.]    EXERCISE 2.--Draw neatly a triangle with sides about 100 millimeters  long, measure each of its angles and take their sum. No matter what may  be the shape of the triangle, this sum should be very nearly  180°--exactly 180° if the work were perfect--but perfection can seldom  be attained and one of the first lessons to be learned in any science  which deals with measurement is, that however careful we may be in our  work some minute error will cling to it and our results can be only  approximately correct. This, however, should not be taken as an excuse  for careless work, but rather as a stimulus to extra effort in order  that the unavoidable errors may be made as small as possible. In the  present case the measured angles may be improved a little by adding  (algebraically) to each of them one third of the amount by which their  sum falls short of 180°, as in the following example:                Measured angles.    Correction.  Corrected angles.                   °                   °              °    A            73.4               + 0.1           73.5    B            49.3               + 0.1           49.4    C            57.0               + 0.1           57.1                -----                              -----    Sum         179.7                              180.0    Defect      + 0.3    This process is in very common use among astronomers, and is called  \"adjusting\" the observations.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Triangulation.]    3. TRIANGLES.--The instruments used by astronomers for the measurement  of angles are usually provided with a telescope, which may be pointed at  different objects, and with a scale, like that of the protractor, to  measure the angle through which the telescope is turned in passing from  one object to another. In this way it is possible to measure the angle  between lines drawn from the instrument to two distant objects, such as  two church steeples or the sun and moon, and this is usually called the  angle between the objects. By measuring angles in this way it is  possible to determine the distance to an inaccessible point, as shown in  Fig. 2. A surveyor at _A_ desires to know the distance to _C_, on the  opposite side of a river which he can not cross. He measures with a tape  line along his own side of the stream the distance _A B_ = 100 yards and  then, with a suitable instrument, measures the angle at _A_ between the  points _C_ and _B_, and the angle at _B_ between _C_ and _A_, finding _B  A C_ = 73.4°, _A B C_ = 49.3°. To determine the distance _A C_ he draws  upon paper a line 100 millimeters long, and marks the ends _a_ and _b_;  with a protractor he constructs at _a_ the angle _b a c_ = 73.4°, and at  _b_ the angle _a b c_ = 49.3°, and marks by _c_ the point where the two  lines thus drawn meet. With the millimeter scale he now measures the  distance _a c_ = 90.2 millimeters, which determines the distance _A C_  across the river to be 90.2 yards, since the triangle on paper has been  made similar to the one across the river, and millimeters on the one  correspond to yards on the other. What is the proposition of geometry  upon which this depends? The measured distance _A B_ in the surveyor's  problem is called a base line.    EXERCISE 3.--With a foot rule and a protractor measure a base line and  the angles necessary to determine the length of the schoolroom. After  the length has been thus found, measure it directly with the foot rule  and compare the measured length with the one found from the angles. If  any part of the work has been carelessly done, the student need not  expect the results to agree.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Finding the moon's distance from the earth.]    In the same manner, by sighting at the moon from widely different parts  of the earth, as in Fig. 3, the moon's distance from us is found to be  about a quarter of a million miles. What is the base line in this case?    4. THE HORIZON--ALTITUDES.--In their observations astronomers and  sailors make much use of the _plane of the horizon_, and practically any  flat and level surface, such as that of a smooth pond, may be regarded  as a part of this plane and used as such. A very common observation  relating to the plane of the horizon is called \"taking the sun's  altitude,\" and consists in measuring the angle between the sun's rays  and the plane of the horizon upon which they fall. This angle between a  line and a plane appears slightly different from the angle between two  lines, but is really the same thing, since it means the angle between  the sun's rays and a line drawn in the plane of the horizon toward the  point directly under the sun. Compare this with the definition given in  the geographies, \"The latitude of a point on the earth's surface is its  angular distance north or south of the equator,\" and note that the  latitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line drawn  from the earth's center to the given point on its surface.    A convenient method of obtaining a part of the plane of the horizon for  use in observation is as follows: Place a slate or a pane of glass upon  a table in the sunshine. Slightly moisten its whole surface and then  pour a little more water upon it near the center. If the water runs  toward one side, thrust the edge of a thin wooden wedge under this side  and block it up until the water shows no tendency to run one way rather  than another; it is then level and a part of the plane of the horizon.  Get several wedges ready before commencing the experiment. After they  have been properly placed, drive a pin or tack behind each one so that  it may not slip.    5. TAKING THE SUN'S ALTITUDE. EXERCISE 4.--Prepare a piece of board 20  centimeters, or more, square, planed smooth on one face and one edge.  Drive a pin perpendicularly into the face of the board, near the middle  of the planed edge. Set the board on edge on the horizon plane and turn  it edgewise toward the sun so that a shadow of the pin is cast on the  plane. Stick another pin into the board, near its upper edge, so that  its shadow shall fall exactly upon the shadow of the first pin, and with  a watch or clock observe the time at which the two shadows coincide.  Without lifting the board from the plane, turn it around so that the  opposite edge is directed toward the sun and set a third pin just as the  second one was placed, and again take the time. Remove the pins and draw  fine pencil lines, connecting the holes, as shown in Fig. 4, and with  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#2)"],[1,"be  dissipated quickly in the dry desert atmosphere. The obvious differences  in the biota on the two sides of the range are probably due to the  contrasting climates.          BIOTIC PROVINCES AND ECOLOGIC ASSOCIATIONS      Because of the elevational extremes and attendant climatic contrasts in  the San Gabriel Mountains, there is a rather wide range of environmental  conditions. Four life-zones are represented: Lower Sonoran, Upper  Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian. Within these zones certain ecologic  communities can be recognized; these represent several biotic  provinces. Table 1 shows the relationships between the environmental  categories recognized by the writer in the San Gabriel Mountains. The  biotic province and ecologic community system is that developed by Munz  and Keck (1949), and the life-zone system is that of Merriam (1898).

Thirty-nine out of the seventy-two mammals  recorded from the San Gabriels are typical of this Province. The coastal  sage-flats at the Pacific base of the mountains and the vast tracts of  chaparral of the coastal slope are included in this Province.    Forming a hiatus between the Pacific and the desert slope is the Sierran  Biotic Province consisting of coniferous forests on the crest of the  range. The chipmunk (_Eutamias speciosus speciosus_) and the introduced  black bear (_Ursus americanus californiensis_) are the only two mammals  which can be considered typical of this area. On the higher peaks of the  range, such as Mount San Antonio and Mount Baden Powell, the Canadian  Life-zone is represented by certain boreal plants.    At scattered points along the crest of the range and on the desert  slope, the Nevadan Biotic Province is represented by the sagebrush scrub  association. No mammals can be considered typical of this region.    The Southern Desert Biotic Province occurs below 6000 feet elevation on  the interior slope of the range, and markedly influences the mammal  fauna of this slope. Twenty-one species of mammals are typical of this  Province.

When  seen from above, the rather level terrain of the association is broken  sharply at the mouths of canyons by dry washes, and is limited below, to  the south, by cultivated land. The coastal sagebrush is the most  characteristic plant of this association, occurring in all undisturbed  parts of the area.    There are several habitats within the coastal sage scrub association.  These differ from one another chiefly on the basis of soil type. The  soil of the rather level sageland in most places is rocky or gravelly,  or, as adjacent to washes, it is finely sandy in texture, and supports  the major plants of the association. Most of the eroded adobe banks at  the bases of the foothills support these same plants, with white sage  being the dominant species. Locally, as in damp hollows or cleared  areas, there is grassland. Jumbles of boulders, sand, gravel, and steep  cutbanks, are characteristic of the channels of dry washes, these areas  supporting sparse vegetation. The fauna and flora of the washes are  distinct from those of surrounding sage flats. Because they are included  within the geographic limits of the coastal sage belt, however, the  washes are discussed along with this association.    The abruptness with which one habitat gives way to another in this  association causes sharp dividing lines between the local ranges of  certain mammals. For example, in trap lines transecting dry washes and  level sageland two assemblages of rodents were found. That part of the  line amid the boulders and cutbanks of the wash took mostly  _Peromyscus eremicus fraterculus_ and _Neotoma lepida intermedia_, while  _Perognathus fallax fallax_, _Dipodomys agilis agilis_, and _Peromyscus  maniculatus gambeli_ were taken in the adjacent sage flats. The steep  adobe slopes of the foothills, which constitute the upper part of the  coastal sage scrub association, are commonly inhabited by _Peromyscus  californicus insignis_, which rarely occurs in the level tracts of sage  a few yards away. Thus, this association is not homogeneous with regard  to its rodent population; many of these species have local and  discontinuous distributions.    The following list gives the results of about 500 trap nights (a trap  night equals one trap set out for one night) in typical coastal  sage-scrub association one-half mile southwest of the mouth of San  Antonio Canyon, at 1700 feet elevation.
