You are also furnished  with all the information, we at present possess, of the ports which you are  to survey; and nine Government Chronometers have been embarked in the  Adventure, and three in the Beagle, for the better determination of the  Longitudes.    \"You are therefore hereby required and directed, as soon as both vessels  shall be in all respects ready, to put to sea with them; and on your way to  your ulterior destination, you are to make, or call at, the following  places, successively; namely; Madeira: Teneriffe: the northern point of St.  Antonio, and the anchorage at St. Jago; both in the Cape Verd Islands: the  Island of Trinidad, in the Southern Atlantic: and Rio de Janeiro: for the  purpose of ascertaining the differences of the longitudes of those several  places.    \"At Rio de Janeiro, you will receive any supplies you may require; and make  with the Commander-in-chief, on that Station, such arrangements as may tend  to facilitate your receiving further supplies, in the course of your  Expedition.    \"After which, you are to proceed to the entrance of the River Plata, to  ascertain the longitudes of the Cape Santa Maria, and Monte Video: you are  then to proceed to survey the Coasts, Islands, and Straits; from Cape St.  Antonio, at the south side {xvii} of the River Plata, to Chiloe; on the  west coast of America; in such manner and order, as the state of the  season, the information you may have received, or other circumstances, may  induce you to adopt.    \"You are to continue on this service until it shall be completed; taking  every opportunity to communicate to our Secretary, and the  Commander-in-Chief, your proceedings: and also, whenever you may be able to  form any judgment of it, where the Commander-in-Chief, or our Secretary,  may be able to communicate with you.    \"In addition to any arrangements made with the Admiral, for recruiting your  stores, and provisions; you are, of course, at liberty to take all other  means, which may be within your reach, for that essential purpose.    \"You are to avail yourself of every opportunity of collecting and  preserving Specimens of such objects of Natural History as may be new,  rare, or interesting; and you are to instruct Captain Stokes, and all the  other Officers, to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections  in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the  Public.    \"In the event of any irreparable accident happening to either of the two  vessels, you are to cause the officers and crew of the disabled vessel to  be {xviii} removed into the other, and with her, singly, to proceed in  prosecution of the service, or return to England, according as  circumstances shall appear to require; understanding that the officers and  crews of both vessels are hereby authorized, and required, to continue to  perform their duties, according to their respective ranks and stations, on  board either vessel to which they may be so removed. Should, unfortunately,  your own vessel be the one disabled, you are in that case to take the  command of the Beagle: and, in the event of any fatal accident happening to  yourself; Captain Stokes is hereby authorized to take the command of the  Expedition; either on board the Adventure, or Beagle, as he may prefer;  placing the officer of the Expedition who may then be next in seniority to  him, in command of the second vessel: also, in the event of your inability,  by sickness or otherwise, at any period of this service, to continue to  carry the Instructions into execution, you are to transfer them to Captain  Stokes, or to the surviving officer then next in command to you, who is  hereby required to execute them, in the best manner he can, for the  attainment of the object in view.    \"When you shall have completed the service, or shall, from any cause, be  induced to give it up; you will return to Spithead with all convenient  expedition; and report your arrival, and proceedings, to our Secretary, for  our information.    {xix}    \"Whilst on the South American Station, you are to consider yourself under  the command of the Admiral of that Station; to whom we have expressed our  desire that he should not interfere with these orders, except under  peculiar necessity.     \"Given under our hands the 16th of May 1826.

CROKER.\"    On the 22d of May, 1826, the Adventure and Beagle sailed from Plymouth;  and, in their way to Rio de Janeiro, called successively at Madeira,  Teneriffe, and St. Jago.    Unfavourable weather prevented a boat being sent ashore at the northern  part of San Antonio; but observations were made in Terrafal Bay, on the  south-west side of the island: and, after crossing the Equator, the  Trade-wind hung so much to the southward, that Trinidad could not be  approached without a sacrifice of time, which, it was considered, might be  prejudicial to more important objects of the Expedition.    Both ships anchored at Rio de Janeiro on the {xx} 10th of August, and  remained there until the 2d of October, when they sailed to the River  Plata.    In Maldonado,[3] their anchors were dropped on the 13th of the same month;  and, till the 12th of November, each vessel was employed on the north side  of the river, between Cape St. Mary and Monte Video.           *       *       *       *       *      {xxi}    CONTENTS    VOLUME I.    ------      CHAPTER I.

Of  the fifteenth, I have seen another Madonna upon an altar likewise of S.  Francesco; and whoever may have been the author, he has shewn that the art,  even in those days, had already emerged from its infancy, without arriving  at that rank to which the great Andrea Mantegna conducted it, of whom we  have twice already had occasion to speak shortly in the course of this  work; a subject which we now resume, and shall enlarge upon more fully.    Although the honour of having given birth to Mantegna can no longer, as  formerly, be denied to Padua, his school was, nevertheless, established in  Mantua, where, under the auspices of Marchese Lodovico Gonzaga, he settled  with his family, without, however, ceasing to exert his talents elsewhere,  and more particularly in Rome. The chapel which he painted at the desire of  Innocent VIII. in the Vatican still exists, though injured by time; and it  is clear that in the imitation of the antique constantly pursued by him he  greatly improved, through the number of examples to be found throughout the  city. He never varied his manner, which I described when I treated of him  as a pupil of Squarcione in Padua; but he still continued to perfect it.  Several works produced during his latter years are yet extant at Mantua;  and far surpassing the rest is his picture of Victory, painted upon  canvass. Another is the Virgin, amidst various saints, among whom S.  Michele the Archangel, and S. Maurizio, are seen holding her mantle, which  is stretched over Francesco Gonzaga; he is in a kneeling posture, while the  Virgin extends her hand over him in sign of protection: more in the  background appear the two patrons of the city, S. Andrea and S. Longino,  and the infant St. John before the throne, with S. Anna, as is supposed at  least by Vasari and Ridolfi, little exact in their description of this  picture, inasmuch as the rosary held in her hand distinguishes her for the  princess, consort of the Marchese, kneeling at her husband's side. Mantua,  perhaps, boasts no other specimen equally sought after and admired by  strangers; and though produced in 1495, it is still free, in a conspicuous  degree, from the effects of three ages, which it has already survived. It  is truly wonderful to behold carnations so delicate, coats of armour so  glittering, draperies so finely varied, with ornamental fruits still so  fresh and dewy to the eye. Each separate head might serve as a school, from  its fine character and vivacity, and not a few from imitation of the  antique; while the design, as well in its naked as in its clothed parts,  expresses a softness which sufficiently repels the too general opinion,  that the stiff style and that of Mantegna are much the same thing. There is  also an union of colours, a delicacy of hand, and a peculiar grace, that to  me appears almost the last stage of the art towards that perfection which  it acquired from Lionardo. His works upon canvass remind us of that  exquisite taste to which he had been habituated by Squarcione, who supplied  him with pictures of the same kind from various places, and indeed the  whole of the above specimen discovers him to have been an artist who spared  neither his colours nor his time, to produce works that might satisfy his  own ideas, as well as the eye of the spectator.    His great masterpiece, nevertheless, according to the judgment of Vasari,  is the Triumph of Caesar, represented in different pictures, which, becoming  the prey of the Germans in the sackage of the city, were finally sent into  England. They belonged to a great hall in the palace of S. Sebastiano,  \"which was completed,\" says Equicola, an historian of his native place, \"by  Lorenzo Costa, an excellent artist, who added to it all that pomp which  used to attend upon a triumph, besides the spectators before wanting.\" But  these pictures having perished, there yet remain other considerable relics  from the works of Andrea, in a saloon of the castle, entitled by Ridolfi  the _Camera degli Sposi_. We there behold copious productions executed in  fresco, and among them several portraits of the Gonzaga family, still in  good preservation; and some Genii drawn over a door-way, so joyous,  animated, and airy, that nothing can be supposed to surpass them. Among  collections of art we more rarely meet with specimens of him than is really  believed, his genuine hand being recognized, not only by its lightness, by  its rectilinear folds, or by its yellowish landscape, spread with certain  minute and broken little stones; but by the skill of its design and the  delicacy of its pencil. It does not appear that he produced many pictures  for private exhibition, engaged as he was in works of greater magnitude,  and upon many engravings. More than fifty of these last have been  enumerated, for the chief part abounding with figures; labours which must  have occupied a large portion of his best time. But there are some persons,  as I have observed, (vol. i. p. 136,) who would considerably reduce this  number, whether correctly or not posterity will, perhaps, ascertain.    The style of Andrea greatly influenced that of his age, and imitations of  it are to be seen even beyond his school, which was extremely flourishing  in Mantua. We enumerate among his most distinguished disciples Francesco,  and one of his other sons. There is a paper yet extant, in which they  undertake to complete the chamber of the castle just alluded to, of which  their father Andrea had only painted the walls. To these they added the  beautiful vaulted recess. Whoever examines it must confess that the science  of foreshortening, originally attributed to Melozio, was here improved and  nearly brought to perfection by Mantegna and his sons. In the same work  appear several exquisitely drawn infantine figures, under different points  of view, and admirably shortened, so as to lose nothing in comparison with  those of Melozio, though his painting of Paradise, drawn for the church of  SS. Apostoli, was afterwards cut down and placed in the grand Palazzo  Quirinale. The same sons of Mantegna likewise added lateral pictures to an  altar-piece of their father, in a family chapel they had, attached to the  church of S. Andrea; and in the same place they raised a beautiful monument  to his memory in 1517, which has been falsely supposed by some to be the  year of his death, whereas it appears, from many authentic works, that he  closed his days in 1505.    After the death of Mantegna, Lorenzo Costa held the first rank, an artist  of whom we shall treat more at length in the Bolognese School. He adorned  the palace with various histories, and the churches with many of his  pictures, continuing under Francesco to reside in the same place, and  afterwards under Federigo, until beyond the year 1525, in which time he  produced also his picture for his family chapel. There too, like Mantegna,  he wished to have his remains deposited. Following his example, he  established his family in Mantua, where some of his descendants will again  appear at a more modern epoch. But the young Mantegni must be referred to  this more ancient period, and along with them ought to be mentioned Carlo  del Mantegna, who having studied some length of time under Andrea, and  cultivated a complete acquaintance with his style, afterwards introduced  it, as we shall shew, into Genoa. Carlo is supposed to have assisted in the  labours of the palace and the chapel above mentioned, as well as in many  others ascribed to the disciples of Mantegna, among which are two histories  of the ark preserved in the monastery of S. Benedetto at Mantua, where  Andrea's manner appears somewhat more amplified, though boasting less  beautiful forms. But few certain productions of his followers can be fixed  upon, their labours being confounded by connoisseurs, from their  resemblance of their style and name to those of their master. And it has  thus happened in an extremely interesting historical point; for Coreggio  having studied, it appears, under Francesco Mantegna, was believed a  scholar of Andrea, already deceased before Allegri had attained his twelfth  year.    Still more celebrated than the preceding were the names of Gianfrancesco  Carotto and Francesco Monsignori, of Verona. Such was the progress made by  the former, that Andrea was in the habit of sending forth his labours as  the work of his own hand. He was celebrated for his portraits; and for his  composition, equally excellent in large as in small pieces; and he was  employed by the Visconti, at Milan, as well as in the court of Monferrato,  and to a still greater extent in his native place. Although an artist who  flourished at so early a period, in a few of his pictures he might be  pronounced more great and harmonious than Andrea himself; as we may gather  from his fine altar-piece of S. Fermo, at Verona, and from that of his  _Angioli_, at Santa Eufemia, whose side pictures represent two virgins,  very manifestly imitated from Raffaello. He is not to be confounded with  Giovanni Carotto, his brother and his pupil, and very greatly inferior to  him. Francesco Monsignori ought not to be referred to Verona, but to  Mantua, where he established himself, honoured by the Marchese Francesco  with his confidence, and remunerated in the most liberal manner. If this  artist, also, does not exhibit the beautiful forms, and the purity of  design so remarkable in the works of his master, he approaches nearer to  the modern taste; his contours more full, his drapery less trite, and his  softness more finely studied. In his drawings of animals, he was also  considered the Zeuxis of his age; insomuch that he succeeded in imposing  upon a real dog with a"]]]
