[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#2)"],[1,", I living with my father, and as soon as  found out that we were doing well in business, I sent to Sidney for  my wife and children. They were to come by stage, and were due, after  passing through Bainbridge, at our house at four o'clock in the morning.  We were up early to meet the stage; but when it arrived, the driver told  us that my wife had stopped at the public house in Bainbridge.    Wondering what this could mean, I at once set out with my brother and  walked over to the village. It was daylight when we arrived, and knocked  loudly at the public house door. After considerable delay, the clerk  came to the door and let us in. He also asked as to \"take something,\"  which we did. The clerk knew us well, and I inquired if my wife was in  the house; he said she was, told us what room she was in, and we went up  stairs and found her in bed with her children. Waking her, I asked her  why she did not come home, in the stage? She replied that the clerk down  stairs told her that the stage did not go beyond the house, and that she  expected to walk over, as soon as it was daylight, or that possibly we  might come for her.    I declare, I was so young and unsophisticated that I suspected nothing,  and blamed only the stupidity, as I supposed, of the clerk in telling  her that the stage did not go beyond Bainbridge. My wife got up and  dressed herself and the children, and then as it was broad daylight,  after endeavoring, ineffectually, to get a conveyance, we started for  home on foot, she leading the little boy, and I carrying the youngest  child. We were not far on our way when she suddenly stopped, stooped  down, and exclaimed:    \"O! see what I have found in the road.\"    And she showed me a ten dollar bill. I was quite surprised, and  verdantly enough, advised looking around for more money, which my wife,  brother and I industriously did for some minutes. It was full four weeks  before I found out where that ten dollar bill came from. Meanwhile, my  wife was received and was living in her new home, being treated with  great kindness by all of us. It was evident, however, that she had  something on her mind which troubled her, and one morning, about a  month after her arrival, I found her in tears. I asked her what was the  matter? She said that she had been deceiving me; that she did not pick  up the ten dollar bill in the road; but that it was given to her by the  clerk in the public house in Bainbridge; only, however, for this: he  had grossly insulted her; she had resented it, and he had given her the  money, partly as a reparation, and partly to prevent her from speaking  of the insult to me or to others.    But by this time my hitherto blinded eyes were opened, and I charged  her with being false to me. She protested she had not been; but finally  confessed that she had been too intimate with the clerk at the hotel.  I began a suit at law against the clerk; but finally, on account of my  wife's family and for the sake of my children, I stopped proceedings,  the clerk paying the costs of the suit as far as it had gone, and giving  me what I should probably have got from him in the way of damages. My  wife too, was apparently so penitent, and I was so much infatuated with  her, that I forgave her, and even consented to continue to live with  her. But I removed to Greenville, Greene County, N. Y., where I went  into the black-smithing business, and was very successful. We lived  here long enough to add two children to our little family; but as time  went on, the woman became bad again, and displayed the worst depravity.  I could no longer live with her, and we finally mutually agreed upon  a life-long separation--she insisting upon keeping the children, and  going to Rochester where she subsequently developed the full extent of  her character.    This, as nearly as I remember, was in the year 1838, and with this came  a new trouble upon me. Just before the separation, I received from my  brother's wife a note for one hundred dollars, and sold it. It proved to  be a forgery. I was temporarily in Troy, N. Y., when the discovery  was made, and as I made no secret of my whereabouts at any time, I was  followed to Troy, was there arrested, and after lying in jail at Albany  one night, was taken next morning to Coxsackie, Greene County, and front  thence to Catskill. After one day in jail there, I was brought before a  justice and examined on the charge of uttering a forged note. There was  a most exciting trial of four days duration. I had two good lawyers who  did their best to show that I did not know the note to be forged when  I sold it, but the justice seemed determined to bind me over for  trial, and he did so, putting me under five hundred dollars' bonds. My  half-sister at Sidney was sent for, came to Catskill, and became bail  for me. I was released, and my lawyers advised me to leave, which I did  at once, and went to Pittsfield, and from there to Worthington,  Mass., where I had another half-sister, who was married to Mr. Josiah  Bartlett, and was well off.    Here I settled down, for all that I knew to the contrary, for life. For  some years past, I had devoted my leisure hours from the forge to  the honest endeavor to make up for the deficiencies in my youthful  education, and had acquired, among other things, a good knowledge  of medicine. I did not however, believe in any of the \"schools\"  particularly those schools that make use of mineral medicines in  their practice. I favored purely vegetable remedies, and had been very  successful in administering them. So I began life anew, in Worthington,  as a Doctor, and aided by my half-sister and her friends, I soon  secured a remunerative practice.    I was beginning to be truly happy. I supposed that the final separation,  mutually agreed upon between my wife and myself, was as effectual as all  the courts in the country could make it, and I looked upon myself as  a free man. Accordingly, after I had been in Worthington some months I  began to pay attentions to the daughter of a flourishing farmer. She was  a fine girl; she received my addresses favorably, and we were finally  privately married. This was the beginning of my life-long troubles. In  a few weeks her father found out that I had been previously married, and  was not, so far as he knew, either a divorced man or a widower. And  so it happened, that one day when I was at his house, and with his  daughter, he suddenly came home with a posse of people and a warrant for  my arrest. I was taken before a justice, and while we were waiting for  proceedings to begin, or, possibly for the justice to arrive, I took the  excited father aside and said:    \"You know I have a fine horse and buggy at the door. Get in with me, and  ride down home. I will see your daughter and make everything right with  her, and if you will let me run away, I'll give her her the horse and  buggy.\"    The offer was too tempting to be refused. The father had the warrant in  his pocket, and he accepted my proposal. We rode to his house, and he  went into the back-room by direction of his daughter while she and I  talked in the hall. I explained matters as well as I could; I promised  to see her again, and that very soon. My horse and buggy were at the  door. Hastily bidding my new and young wife \"good-bye,\" I sprang into  the buggy and drove rapidly away. The father rushed to the door and  raised a great hue and cry, and what was more, raised the neighbors; I  had not driven five miles before all Worthington was after me. But I had  the start, the best horse, and I led in the race. I drove to Hancock,  N.Y., where my pursuers lost the trail; thence to Bennington, Vt., next  to Brattleboro, Vt., and from there to Templeton, Mass. What befel me at  Templeton, shall be related in the next chapter.        CHAPTER II. MISERIES FROM MY SECOND MARRIAGE.    LOVE-MAKING IN MASSACHUSETTS--ARREST FOR BIGAMY--TRIAL AT  NORTHAMPTON--A STUNNING SENTENCE--SENT TO STATE PRISON--LEARNING THE  BRUSH BUSINESS--SHARPENING PICKS--PRISON FARE--IN THE HOSPITAL--KIND  TREATMENT--SUCCESSFUL HORSE SHOEING--THE WARDEN MY FRIEND--EFFORTS FOR  MY RELEASE--A FULL PARDON.        At Templeton I speedily made known my profession, and soon had a very  good medical practice which one or two \"remarkable cures\" materially  increased. I was doing well and making money. I boarded in a respectable  farmer's family, and after living there about six months there came  another most unhappy occurrence. From the day, almost, when I began  to board with this farmer there sprung up a strong attachment between  myself and his youngest daughter which soon ripened into mutual love.  She rode about with me when I went to see my patients, who were getting  to be numerous, and we were much in each other's company.    On one occasion she accompanied me to Worcester where I had some  patients. We went to a public house where she and her family were well  known, and when she was asked by the landlord how she happened to come  there with the doctor, her prompt answer was:    \"Why, we are married; did'nt you know it?\"    She refused even to go to the table without my attendance, and when I  was out visiting some patients, she waited for her meals till I came  back. We stayed there but two days and returned together to Templeton.    A month afterward her brother was in Worcester, and stopped at this  house. The landlord, after some conversation about general matters,  said:    \"So your sister is married to the Doctor?\"    \"I know nothing about it,\" was the reply.    This led to a full and altogether too free disclosure to the astonished  brother about the particulars of our visit to the same house a month  before, and his sister's representations that we were married. The  brother immediately started for home, and repeated the story, as it was  told to him, to his father and the family. Without seeing his daughter,  the father at once procured a warrant, and had me arrested and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#2)"],[1,"nor Chinese.    Without reference to any military phase of the problem, this detached  population obviously demanded and deserved adequate mail and  transportation facilities. How to secure the quickest and most  dependable communication with the populous sections of the East had long  been a serious proposition. Private corporations and Congress had not  been wholly insensible to the needs of the West. Subsidized stage routes  had for some years been in operation, and by the close of 1858 several  lines were well-equipped and doing much business over the so-called  Southern and Central routes. Perhaps the most common route for sending  mail from the East to the Pacific Coast was by steamship from New York  to Panama where it was unloaded, hurried across the Isthmus, and again  shipped by water to San Francisco. All these lines of traffic were slow  and tedious, a letter in any case requiring from three to four weeks to  reach its destination. The need of a more rapid system of communication  between the East and West at once became apparent and it was to supply  this need that the Pony Express really came into existence.    The story goes that in the autumn of 1854, United States Senator William  Gwin of California was making an overland trip on horseback from San  Francisco to Washington, D. C. He was following the Central route via  Salt Lake and South Pass, and during a portion of his journey he had for  a traveling companion, Mr. B. F. Ficklin, then General Superintendent  for the big freighting and stage firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell of  Leavenworth. Ficklin, it seems, was a resourceful and progressive man,  and had long been engaged in the overland transportation business. He  had already conceived an idea for establishing a much closer transit  service between the Missouri river and the Coast, but, as is the case  with many innovators, had never gained a serious hearing. He had the  traffic agent's natural desire to better the existing service in the  territory which his line served; and he had the ambition of a loyal  employee to put into effect a plan that would bring added honor and  preferment to his firm. In addition to possessing these worthy ideals,  it is perhaps not unfair to state that Ficklin was personally ambitious.    Nevertheless, Ficklin confided his scheme enthusiastically to Senator  Gwin, at the same time pointing out the benefits that would accrue to  California should it ever be put into execution. The Senator at once saw  the merits of the plan and quickly caught the contagion. Not only was he  enough of a statesman to appreciate the worth of a fast mail line across  the continent, but he was also a good enough politician to realize that  his position with his constituents and the country at large might be  greatly strengthened were he to champion the enactment of a popular  measure that would encourage the building of such a line through the aid  of a Federal subsidy.    So in January, 1855, Gwin introduced in the Senate a bill which proposed  to establish a weekly letter express service between St. Louis and San  Francisco. The express was to operate on a ten-day schedule, follow the  Central Route, and was to receive a compensation not exceeding $500.00  for each round trip. This bill was referred to the Committee on Military  Affairs where it was quietly tabled and \"killed.\"    For the next five years the attention of Congress was largely taken up  with the anti-slavery troubles that led to secession and war. Although  the people of the West, and the Pacific Coast in particular, continued  to agitate the need of a new and quick through mail service, for a long  time little was done. It has been claimed that southern representatives  in Congress during the decade before the war managed to prevent any  legislation favorable to overland mail routes running North of the  slave-holding states; and that they concentrated their strength to  render government aid to the southern routes whenever possible.    At that time there were three generally recognized lines of mail  traffic, of which the Panama line was by far the most important. Next  came the so-called southern or \"Butterfield\" route which started from  St. Louis and ran far to the southward, entering California from the  extreme southeast corner of the state; a goodly amount of mail being  sent in this direction. The Central route followed the Platte River into  Wyoming and reached Sacramento via Salt Lake City, almost from a due  easterly direction. On account of its location this route or trail could  be easily controlled by the North in case of war. It had received very  meagre support from the Government, and carried as a rule, only local  mail. While the most direct route to San Francisco, it had been rendered  the least important. This was not due solely to Congressional  manipulation. Because of its northern latitude and the numerous high  mountain ranges it traversed, this course was often blockaded with deep  snows and was generally regarded as extremely difficult of access during  the winter months.    While a majority of the people of California were loyal to the Union,  there was a vigorous minority intensely in sympathy with the southern  cause and ready to conspire for, or bring about by force of arms if  necessary, the secession of their state. As the Civil War became more  and more imminent, it became obvious to Union men in both East and West  that the existing lines of communication were untrustworthy. Just as  soon as trouble should start, the Confederacy could, and most certainly  would, gain control of the southern mail routes. Once in control, she  could isolate the Pacific coast for many months and thus enable her  sympathizers there the more effectually to perfect their plans of  secession. Or she might take advantage of these lines of travel, and, by  striking swiftly and suddenly, organize and reinforce her followers in  California, intimidate the Unionists, many of whom were apathetic, and  by a single bold stroke snatch the prize away from her antagonist before  the latter should have had time to act.    To avert this crisis some daring and original plan of communication had  to be organized to keep the East and West in close contact with each  other; and the Pony Express was the fulfillment of such a plan, for it  made a close cooperation between the California loyalists and the  Federal Government possible until after the crisis did pass. Yet,  strange as it may seem, this providential enterprise was not brought  into existence nor even materially aided by the Government. It was  organized and operated by a private corporation after having been  encouraged in its inception by a United States Senator who later turned  traitor to his country.    It finally happened that in the winter of 1859-60, Mr. William Russell,  senior partner of the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, was called  to Washington in connection with some Government freight contracts.  While there he chanced to become acquainted with Senator Gwin who,  having been aroused, as we have seen, several years before, by one of  the firm's subordinates, at once brought before Mr. Russell the need of  better mail connections over the Central route, and of the especial need  of better communication should war occur.    Russell at once awoke to the situation. While a loyal citizen and fully  alive to the strategic importance which the matter involved, he also  believed that he saw a good business opening. Could his firm but grasp  the opportunity, and demonstrate the possibility of keeping the Central  route open during the winter months, and could they but lower the  schedule of the Panama line, a Government contract giving them a virtual  monopoly in carrying the transcontinental mail might eventually be  theirs.    He at once hurried West, and at Fort Leavenworth met his partners,  Messrs. Majors and Waddell, to whom he confidently submitted the new  proposition. Much to Russell's chagrin, these gentlemen were not elated  over the plan. While passively interested, they keenly foresaw the great  cost which a year around overland fast mail service would involve. They  were unable to see any chance of the enterprise paying expenses, to say  nothing of profits. But Russell, with cheerful optimism, contended that  while the project might temporarily be a losing venture, it would pay  out in time. He asserted that the opportunity of making good with a hard  undertaking--one that had been held impossible of realization--would  be a strong asset to the firm's reputation. He also declared that in his  conversation with Gwin he had already committed their company to the  undertaking, and he did not see how they could, with honor and  propriety, evade the responsibility of attempting it. Knowledge of the  last mentioned fact at once enlisted the support or his partners.  Probably no firm has ever surpassed in integrity that of Russell,  Majors, and Waddell, famous throughout the West in the freighting and  mail business before the advent of railroads in that section of the men,  the verbal promise of one of their number was a binding guarantee and as  sacredly respected as a bonded obligation. Finding themselves thus  committed, they at once began preparations with tremendous activity. All  this happened early in the year 1860.    The first step was to form a corporation, the more adequately to conduct  the enterprise; and to that end the Central Overland California and  Pike's Peak Express Company was organized under a charter granted by the  Territory of Kansas. Besides the three original members of the firm, the  incorporators included General Superintendent B. F. Ficklin, together  with F. A. Bee, W. W. Finney, and John S. Jones, all tried and  trustworthy stage employees who were retained on account of their wide  experience in the overland traffic business. The new concern then took  over the old stage line from Atchison to"]]]
