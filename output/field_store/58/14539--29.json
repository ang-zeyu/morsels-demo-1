Her mother, too, mourned with them.    \"Alas!\" they cried, \"alas, for the little rabbit. He was always kind and  gentle. Now your child is dead and you will be lonesome.\"    The little girl's mother called in her little friends and made a great  mourning feast for the little rabbit. As he lay in the tepee his adopted  mother's little friends brought many precious things and covered his  body. At the feast were given away robes and kettles and blankets and  knives and great wealth in honor of the little rabbit. Him they wrapped  in a robe with his little moccasins on and buried him in a high place  upon a scaffold.              THE PET DONKEY    There was a chief's daughter once who had a great many relations so that  everybody knew she belonged to a great family.    When she grew up she married and there were born to her twin sons. This  caused great rejoicing in her father's camp, and all the village women  came to see the babes. She was very happy.    As the babes grew older, their grandmother made for them two saddle bags  and brought out a donkey.    \"My two grandchildren,\" said the old lady, \"shall ride as is becoming  to children having so many relations. Here is this donkey. He is patient  and surefooted. He shall carry the babes in the saddle bags, one on  either side of his back.\"    It happened one day that the chief's daughter and her husband were  making ready to go on a camping journey. The father, who was quite proud  of his children, brought out his finest pony, and put the saddle bags on  the pony's back.    \"There,\" he said, \"my sons shall ride on the pony, not on a donkey; let  the donkey carry the pots and kettles.\"    So his wife loaded the donkey with the household things. She tied the  tepee poles into two great bundles, one on either side of the donkey's  back; across them she put the travois net and threw into it the pots and  kettles and laid the skin tent across the donkey's back.    But no sooner done than the donkey began to rear and bray and kick. He  broke the tent poles and kicked the pots and kettles into bits and tore  the skin tent. The more he was beaten the more he kicked.    At last they told the grandmother. She laughed. \"Did I not tell you the  donkey was for the children,\" she cried. \"He knows the babies are  the chief's children. Think you he will be dishonored with pots and  kettles?\" and she fetched the children and slung them over the donkey's  back, when he became at once quiet again.    The camping party left the village and went on their journey. But the  next day as they passed by a place overgrown with bushes, a band of  enemies rushed out, lashing their ponies and sounding their war whoop.  All was excitement. The men bent their bows and seized their lances.  After a long battle the enemy fled. But when the camping party came  together again--where were the donkey and the two babes? No one knew.  For a long time they searched, but in vain. At last they turned to go  back to the village, the father mournful, the mother wailing. When they  came to the grandmother's tepee, there stood the good donkey with the  two babes in the saddle bags.              THE RABBIT AND THE ELK    The little rabbit lived with his old grandmother, who needed a new  dress. \"I will go out and trap a deer or an elk for you,\" he said. \"Then  you shall have a new dress.\"    When he went out hunting he laid down his bow in the path while he  looked at his snares. An elk coming by saw the bow.    \"I will play a joke on the rabbit,\" said the elk to himself. \"I will  make him think I have been caught in his bow string.\" He then put one  foot on the string and lay down as if dead.    By and by the rabbit returned. When he saw the elk he was filled with  joy and ran home crying: \"Grandmother, I have trapped a fine elk. You  shall have a new dress from his skin. Throw the old one in the fire!\"    This the old grandmother did.    The elk now sprang to his feet laughing. \"Ho, friend rabbit,\" he called,  \"You thought to trap me; now I have mocked you.\" And he ran away into  the thicket.    The rabbit who had come back to skin the elk now ran home again.  \"Grandmother, don't throw your dress in the fire,\" he cried. But it was  too late. The old dress was burned.            THE RABBIT AND THE GROUSE GIRLS    The rabbit once went out on the prairie in winter time. On the side of a  hill away from the wind he found a great company of girls all with grey  and speckled blankets over their backs. They were the grouse girls and  they were coasting down hill on a board. When the rabbit saw them, he  called out:    \"Oh, maidens, that is not a good way to coast down hill. Let me get you  a fine skin with bangles on it that tinkle as you slide.\" And away he  ran to the tepee and brought a skin bag. It had red stripes on it and  bangles that tinkled. \"Come and get inside,\" he said to the grouse  girls. \"Oh, no, we are afraid,\" they answered. \"Don't be afraid, I can't  hurt you. Come, one of you,\" said the rabbit. Then as each hung back he  added coaxingly: \"If each is afraid alone, come all together. I can't  hurt you _all_.\" And so he coaxed the whole flock into the bag. This  done, the rabbit closed the mouth of the bag, slung it over his back and  came home. \"Grandmother,\" said he, as he came to the tepee, \"here is a  bag full of game. Watch it while I go for willow sticks to make spits.\"    But as soon as the rabbit had gone out of the tent, the grouse girls  began to cry out:    \"Grandmother, let us out.\"    \"Who are you?\" asked the old woman.    \"Your dear grandchildren,\" they answered.    \"But how came you in the bag?\" asked the old woman.    \"Oh, our cousin was jesting with us. He coaxed us in the bag for a joke.  Please let us out.\"    \"Certainly, dear grandchildren, I will let you out,\" said the old  woman as she untied the bag: and lo, the grouse flock with  achuck-a-chuck-achuck flew up, knocking over the old grandmother and  flew out of the square smoke opening of the winter lodge. The old woman  caught only one grouse as it flew up and held it, grasping a leg with  each hand.    When the rabbit came home with the spits she called out to him:    \"Grandson, come quick. They got out but I have caught two.\"    When he saw what had happened he was quite angry, yet could not keep  from laughing.    \"Grandmother, you have but one grouse,\" he cried, \"and it is a very  skinny one at that.\"              THE FAITHFUL LOVERS    There once lived a chief's daughter who had many relations. All the  young men in the village wanted to have her for wife, and were all eager  to fill her skin bucket when she went to the brook for water.    There was a young man in the village who was industrious and a good  hunter; but he was poor and of a mean family. He loved the maiden  and when she went for water, he threw his robe over her head while he  whispered in her ear:    \"Be my wife. I have little but I am young and strong. I will treat you  well, for I love you.\"    For a long time the maiden did not answer, but one day she whispered  back.    \"Yes, you may ask my father's leave to marry me. But first you must do  something noble. I belong to a great family and have many relations. You  must go on a war party and bring back the scalp of an enemy.\"    The young man answered modestly, \"I will try to do as you bid me. I am  only a hunter, not a warrior. Whether I shall be brave or not I do not  know. But I will try to take a scalp for your sake.\"    So he made a war party of seven, himself and six other young men. They  wandered through the enemy's country, hoping to get a chance to strike a  blow. But none came, for they found no one of the enemy.    \"Our medicine is unfavorable,\" said their leader at last. \"We shall have  to return home.\"    Before they started they sat down to smoke and rest beside a beautiful  lake at the foot of a green knoll that rose from its shore. The knoll  was covered with green grass and somehow as they looked at it they had  a feeling that there was something about it that was mysterious or  uncanny.    But there was a young man in the party named the jester, for he was  venturesome and full of fun. Gazing at the knoll he said: \"Let's run and  jump on its top.\"    \"No,\" said the young lover, \"it looks mysterious. Sit still and finish  your smoke.\"    \"Oh, come on, who's afraid,\" said the jester, laughing. \"Come on  you--come on!\" and springing to his feet he ran up the side of the  knoll.    Four of the young men followed. Having reached the top of the knoll all  five began to jump and stamp about in sport, calling, \"Come on, come  on,\" to the others. Suddenly they stopped--the knoll had begun to move  toward the water. It was a gigantic turtle. The five men cried out in  alarm and tried to run--too late! Their feet by some power were held  fast to the monster's back.    \"Help us--drag us away,\" they cried; but the others could do nothing. In  a few moments the waves had closed over them.    The other two men, the lover and his friend, went on, but with heavy  hearts, for they had forebodings of evil. After some days, they came to  a river. Worn with fatigue the lover threw himself down on the bank.    \"I will sleep awhile,\" he said, \"for I am wearied and worn out.\"    \"And I will go down to the water and see if I can chance upon a dead  fish. At this time of the year the high water may have left one stranded  on the seashore,\" said his friend.    And as he had said, he found a fish which he cleaned, and then called to  the lover.    \"Come and eat the fish with me. I have cleaned it and made a fire and it  is now cooking.\"    \"No, you eat it; let me rest,\" said the lover.    \"Oh, come on.\"    \"No, let me rest.\"    \"But you are my friend. I will not eat unless you share it with me.\"    \"Very well,\" said the lover, \"I will eat the fish with you, but you must  first make me a promise.

It was published in London in 1608. The Captain was a  typical Elizabethan adventurer, with a gift, like so many of his class,  for picturesque narrative. In what sense, if at all, may his writings on  American topics be classified as \"American\" literary productions? It is  clear that his experiences in the New World were only one phase of the  variegated life of this English soldier of fortune. But the American  imagination has persistently claimed him as representing something  peculiarly ours, namely, a kind of pioneer hardihood, resourcefulness,  leadership, which was essential to the exploration and conquest of the  wilderness. Most of Smith's companions were unfitted for the ordeal  which he survived. They perished miserably in the \"starving time.\" But  he was of the stuff from which triumphant immigrants have ever been  made, and it is our recognition of the presence of these qualities in  the Captain which makes us think of his books dealing with America as  if they were \"American books.\" There are other narratives by colonists  temporarily residing in the Virginia plantations which gratify our  historical curiosity, but which we no more consider a part of American  literature than the books written by Stevenson, Kipling, and Wells  during their casual visits to this country. But Captain Smith's \"True  Relation\" impresses us, like Mark Twain's \"Roughing It,\" with being  somehow true to type. In each of these books the possible unveracities  in detail are a confirmation of their representative American character.    In other words, we have unconsciously formulated, in the course of  centuries, a general concept of \"the pioneer.\" Novelists, poets, and  historians have elaborated this conception. Nothing is more inevitable  than our reaching back to the beginning of the seventeenth century and  endeavoring to select, among the thousands of Englishmen who emigrated  or even thought of emigrating to this country, those who possessed the  genuine heart and sinew of the permanent settler.    Oliver Cromwell, for instance, is said to have thought of emigrating  hither in 1637. If he had joined his friends John Cotton and Roger  Williams in New England, who can doubt that the personal characteristics  of \"my brave Oliver\" would today be identified with the \"American\"  qualities which we discover in 1637 on the shores of Massachusetts Bay?  And what an American settler Cromwell would have made!    If we turn from physical and moral daring to the field of theological  and political speculation, it is easy today to select, among the  writings of the earliest colonists, certain radical utterances which  seem to presage the very temper of the late eighteenth century. Pastor  John Robinson's farewell address to the Pilgrims at Leyden in 1620  contained the famous words: \"The Lord has more truth yet to break forth  out of His holy Word. I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the  reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion.... Luther and  Calvin were great and shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated  not into the whole counsel of God.\" Now John Robinson, like Oliver  Cromwell, never set foot on American soil, but he is identified, none  the less, with the spirit of American liberalism in religion.    In political discussion, the early emergence of that type of  independence familiar to the decade 1765-75 is equally striking. In a  letter written in 1818, John Adams insisted that \"the principles and  feelings which produced the Revolution ought to be traced back for two  hundred years, and sought in the history of the country from the first  plantations in America.\" \"I have always laughed,\" he declared in  an earlier letter, \"at the affectation of representing American  independence as a novel idea, as a modern discovery, as a late  invention. The idea of it as a possible thing, as a probable event, nay  as a necessary and unavoidable measure, in case Great Britain should  assume an unconstitutional authority over us, has been familiar to  Americans from the first settlement of the country.\"    There is, then, a predisposition, a latent or potential Americanism  which existed long before the United States came into being. Now that  our political unity has become a fact, the predisposition is certain to  be regarded by our own and by future generations as evidence of a state  of mind which made our separate national life inevitable. Yet to Thomas  Hutchinson, a sound historian and honest man, the last Royal Governor  of Massachusetts, a separate national life seemed in 1770 an unspeakable  error and calamity.    The seventeenth-century colonists were predominantly English, in blood,  in traditions, and in impulses. Whether we look at Virginia or Plymouth  or at the other colonies that were planted in swift succession along  the seaboard, it is clear that we are dealing primarily with men of the  English race. Most of them would have declared, with as much emphasis  as Francis Hopkinson a century later, \"We of America are in all respects  Englishmen.\" Professor Edward Channing thinks that it took a century  of exposure to colonial conditions to force the English in America away  from the traditions and ideals of those who continued to live in the old  land. But the student of literature must keep constantly in mind that  these English colonizers represented no single type of the national  character. There were many men of many minds even within the contracted  cabin of the Mayflower. The \"sifted wheat\" was by no means all of the  same variety.    For Old England was never more torn by divergent thought and subversive  act than in the period between the death of Elizabeth in 1603 and the  Revolution of 1688. In this distracted time who could say what was  really \"English\"? Was it James the First or Raleigh? Archbishop Laud  or John Cotton? Charles the First or Cromwell? Charles the Second or  William Penn? Was it Churchman, Presbyterian, Independent, Separatist,  Quaker? One is tempted to say that the title of Ben Jonson's comedy  \"Every Man in his Humour\" became the standard of action for two whole  generations of Englishmen, and that there is no common denominator for  emigrants of such varied pattern as Smith and Sandys of Virginia,  Morton of Merrymount, John Winthrop, \"Sir\" Christopher Gardiner and Anne  Hutchinson of Boston, and Roger Williams of Providence. They seem as  miscellaneous as \"Kitchener's Army.\"    It is true that we can make certain distinctions. Virginia, as has often  been said, was more like a continuation of English society, while New  England represented a digression from English society. There were then,  as now, \"stand-patters\" and \"progressives.\" It was the second class who,  while retaining very conservative notions about property, developed  a fearless intellectual radicalism which has written itself into the  history of the United States. But to the student of early American  literature all such generalizations are of limited value. He is dealing  with individual men, not with \"Cavalier\" or \"Roundhead\" as such. He  has learned from recent historians to distrust any such facile  classification of the first colonists. He knows by this time that there  were aristocrats in Massachusetts and commoners in Virginia; that the  Pilgrims of Plymouth were more tolerant than the Puritans of Boston,  and that Rhode Island was more tolerant than either. Yet useful as these  general statements may be, the interpreter of men of letters must  always go back of the racial type or the social system to the individual  person. He recognizes, as a truth for him, that theory of creative  evolution which holds that in the ascending progress of the race each  thinking person becomes a species by himself.    While something is gained, then, by remembering that the racial  instincts and traditions of the first colonists were overwhelmingly  English, and that their political and ethical views were the product of  a turbulent and distraught time, it is even more important to note how  the physical situation of the colonists affected their intellectual and  moral, as well as their political problems. Among the emigrants from  England, as we have seen, there were great varieties of social status,  religious opinion, individual motive. But at least they all possessed  the physical courage and moral hardihood to risk the dangerous voyage,  the fearful hardships, and the vast uncertainties of the new life. To go  out at all, under the pressure of any motive, was to meet triumphantly  a searching test. It was in truth a \"sifting,\" and though a few  picturesque rascals had the courage to go into exile while a few saints  may have been deterred, it is a truism to say that the pioneers were  made up of brave men and braver women.    It cannot be asserted that their courage was the result of any single,  dominating motive, equally operative in all of the colonies. Mrs.  Hemans's familiar line about seeking \"freedom to worship God\" was  measurably true of the Pilgrims of Plymouth, about whom she was writing.  But the far more important Puritan emigration to Massachusetts under  Winthrop aimed not so much at \"freedom\" as at the establishment of a  theocracy according to the Scriptures. These men straightway denied  freedom of worship, not only to newcomers who sought to join them, but  to those members of their own company who developed independent ways of  thinking. The list of motives for emigration ran the whole gamut, from  missionary fervor for converting the savages, down through a commendable  desire for gain, to the perhaps no less praiseworthy wish to escape a  debtor's prison or the pillory. A few of the colonists were rich. Some  were beggars or indentured servants. Most of them belonged to the middle  class. John Harvard was the son of a butcher; Thomas Shepard, the son  of"]]]
