He had offered to send the six of them to boarding school when he  brought home his young girl-wife, but she would not hear of it.    At first they had tried living in the barracks, but after a time  every one in the officers' quarters rose in revolt at the pranks  of those graceless children, so Captain Woolcot took a house some  distance up the Parramatta River, and in considerable bitterness  of spirit removed his family there.    They liked the change immensely; for there was a big wilderness  of a garden, two or three paddocks, numberless sheds for  hide-and-seek, and, best of all, the water.  Their father kept  three beautiful horses, one at he barracks and a hunter and a  good hack at Misrule; so, to make up, the children--not that they  cared in the slightest--went about in shabby, out-at-elbow clothes,  and much-worn boots.  They were taught--all but Pip, who went to  the grammar school--by a very third-class daily governess, who  lived in mortal fear of her ignorance being found out by her  pupils.  As a matter of fact, they had found her out long ago, as  children will, but it suited them very well not to be pushed on  and made to work, so they kept the fact religiously to  themselves.          CHAPTER II    Fowl for Dinner        \"Oh, don't the days seem lank and long    When all goes right and nothing wrong;    And isn't your life extremely flat    With nothing whatever to grumble at?\"    I hope you are not quite deafened yet, for though I have got  through the introductions, tea is not nearly finished, so we must  stay in the nursery a little longer: All the time I have been  talking Pip has been grumbling at the lack of good things.  The  table was not very tempting, certainly; the cloth looked as if it  had been flung on, the china was much chipped and battered, the tea  was very weak, and there was nothing to eat but great thick slices  of bread and butter.  Still, it was the usual tea, and everyone  seemed surprised at Pip's outburst.    \"My father and Esther\" (they all called their young stepmother  by her Christian name) \"are having roast fowl, three vegetables,  and four kinds of pudding,\" he said angrily; \"it isn't fair!\"    \"But we had dinner at one o'clock, Pip, and yours is saved as  usual,\" said Meg, pouring out tea with a lavish allowance of hot  water and sugar.    \"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!\" returned her brother  witheringly.  \"Why shouldn't we have roast fowl and custard and  things?\"    \"Yes, why shouldn't we?\" echoed little greedy Bunty; his eyes  lighting up.    \"What a lot it would take for all of us!\" said Meg, cheerfully  attacking the bread loaf.    \"We're only children--let us be thankful for this nice thick bread  and this abundance of melting butter,\" said Judy, in a good little  tone.    Pip pushed his chair back from the table.    \"I'm going down to ask for some roast fowl,\" he said, with a look  of determination in his eyes.  \"I can't forget the smell of it,  and they'd got a lot on the table--I peeped in the door.\"    He took up his plate and proceeded downstairs, returning presently,  to the surprise of everyone, with quite a large portion on his plate.    \"He couldn't very well refuse,\" he chuckled.  \"Colonel Bryant  is there; but he looked a bit mad--here, Fizz, I'll go you halves.\"    Judy pushed up her plate eagerly at this unusually magnanimous  offer, and received a very small division, a fifth part, perhaps,  with great gratitude.    \"I just LOVE fowl,\" said Nell longingly; \"I've a great mind to go  down and ask for a wing--I believe he'd give it to me.\"    These disrespectful children, as I am afraid you will have noticed,  always alluded to their father as \"he.\"    Nell took up another plate, and departed slowly to the lower  regions.  She followed into the dining-room at the heels of the  housemaid, and stood by the side of her father, her plate well  behind her.    \"Well, my little maid, won't you shake hands with me?  What is  your name?\" said Colonel Bryant, tapping her cheek playfully.    Nell looked up with shy, lovely eyes.    \"Elinor Woolcot, but they call me Nell,\" she said, holding out  her left hand, since her right was occupied with the plate.    \"What a little barbarian you are, Nell!\" laughed her father; but  he gave her a quick, annoyed glance.  \"Where is your right hand?\"    She drew it slowly from behind and held out the cracked old plate.  \"I thought perhaps you would give me some fowl too,\" she said--\"just  a leg or a wing, or bit of breast would do.\"    The Captain's brow darkened.  \"What is the meaning of this?  Pip  has just been to me, too.  Have you nothing to eat in the  nursery?\"    \"Only bread and butter, very thick,\" sighed Nellie.    Esther suppressed a smile with difficulty.    \"But you had dinner, all of you, at one o'clock.\"    \"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding,\" said Nell mournfully.    Captain Woolcot severed a leg almost savagely and put it on her  plate.    \"Now run away; I don't know what has possessed you two to-night.\"    Nellie reached the door, then turned back.    \"Oh, if you would just give me a wing for poor Meg--Judy had some  of Pip's, but Meg hasn't any,\" she said, with a beautiful look of  distress that quite touched Colonel Bryant.    Her father bit his lip, hacked off a wing in ominous silence, and  put it upon her plate.    \"Now run away,--and don't let me have any more of this nonsense,  dear.\"  The last word was a terrible effort.    Nell's appearance with the two portions of fowl was hailed with  uproarious applause in the nursery; Meg was delighted with her  share; cut a piece off for Baby, and the meal went on merrily.    \"Where's Bunty?\", said Nell, pausing suddenly with a very clean  drumstick in her fingers, \"because I HOPE he hasn't gone  too; someway I don't think Father was very pleased, especially  as that man was there.\"    But that small youth had done so, and returned presently  crestfallen.    \"He wouldn't give me any--he told me to go away, and the man  laughed, and Esther said we were very naughty--I got some  feathered potatoes, though, from the table outside the door.\"    He opened his dirty little hands and dropped the uninviting  feathered delicacy out upon the cloth.    \"Bunty, you're a pig,\" sighed Meg, looking up from her book.  She always read at the table, and this particular story was  about some very refined, elegant girls.    \"Pig yourself--all of you've had fowl but me, you greedy things!\"  retorted Bunty fiercely, and eating up his potato very fast.    \"No, the General hasn't,\" said Judy and the old mischief light  sprang up suddenly into her dark eyes.    \"Now, Judy!\" said Meg warningly; she knew too well what that  particular sparkle meant.    \"Oh, I'm not going to hurt you, you dear old thing,\" said Miss Judy,  dancing down the room and bestowing a pat on her sister's fair head  as she passed.  \"It's only the General, who's after havin' a bit  o' fun.\"    She lifted him up out of the high chair, where he had been sitting  drumming on the table with a spoon and eating sugar in the  intervals.    \"It's real action you're going for to see, General,\" she said,  dancing to the door with him.    \"Oh, Judy, what are you going to do?\" said Meg entreatingly.    \"Ju-Ju!\" crowed the General, leaping almost out of Judy's arms,  and scenting fun with the instinct of a veteran.    Down the passage they went, the other five behind to watch  proceedings.  Judy sat down with him on the last step.    \"Boy want chuck-chuck, pretty chuck-chuck?\" she said insidiously.    \"Chuck-chuck, chuck-a-chuck,\" he gurgled, looking all around  for his favourite friends.    \"Dad got lots--all THIS many,\" said Judy, opening her arms very  wide to denote the number in her father's possession.  \"Boydie,  go get them!\"    \"Chuck-chuck,\" crowed the General delightedly, and struggling  to his feet--\"find chuck-chuck.\"    \"In there,\" whispered Judy, giving him a gentle push into the  half-open dining-room door; \"ask Dad.\"    Right across the room the baby tottered on fat, unsteady little  legs.    \"Are the children ALL possessed to-night, Esther?\" said the  Captain, as his youngest son clutched wildly at his leg and  tried to climb up it.    He looked down into the little dirty, dimpling face.  \"Well,  General, and to what do we owe the honour of your presence?\"    \"Chuck-chuck, chuck-a-chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck,\" said the  General, going down promptly upon all fours to seek for the  feathered darlings Judy had said were here.    But Esther gathered up the dear, dirty-faced young rascal and  bore him struggling out of the room.  At the foot of the stairs  she nearly stumbled over the rest of the family.    \"Oh, you scamps, you bad, wicked imps!\" she said, reaching out  to box all their ears, and of course failing.    She sat down on the bottom stair to laugh for a second, then she  handed the General to Pip.  \"To-morrow,\" she said, standing up  and hastily smoothing the rich hair that the General's hands had  clutched gleefully--\"to-morrow I shall beat every one of you  with the broomstick.\"    They watched the train of her yellow' silk dress disappear into  the dining-room again, and returned slowly to the nursery and  their interrupted tea.          CHAPTER III    Virtue Not Always Rewarded      It was not to be expected that such an occurrence could be passed  entirely over, but then again it is difficult to punish seven  children at the same time.  At first Captain Woolcot had requested  Esther to ask Miss Marsh, the governess, to give them all ten  French verbs to learn; but, as Judy pointed out, the General  and Baby and Bunty and Nell had not arrived at the dignity of  French verbs yet, so such a punishment would be iniquitous.  The sentence therefore had not been quite decided upon as yet,  and everyone felt in an uncomfortable state of suspense.    \"Your father says you're "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#2)"],[1,"OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST.

PRONOUNCING VOCABULARY    To aid the reader in pronouncing accurately Book of Mormon names  and also the difficult Spanish and Mexican proper names found in  the body of this work, where it treats of American antiquities, we  append, first, the rules of pronounciation of the Book of Mormon names  formulated at the Book of Mormon Convention held at the Brigham Young  University, Provo, May, 1903; and, second, a list of the Spanish  and Mexican words--chiefly proper names--and their pronounciation  in English. For the pronunciation of the Spanish and Mexican names  I am indebted to Professor John M. Mills of the Latter-day Saints'  University, Salt Lake City, Utah.    RULES FOR THE PRONUNCIATION OF BOOK OF MORMON NAMES    \"Words of two syllables to be accented on the first syllable.    \"Words of three syllables to be accented on the second syllable with  these exceptions, which are to be accented on the first syllable;  namely: Amlici (c, soft); Amnion; Antipas; Antipus; Corihor; Cumeni;  Curelom; Deseret; Gazelam; Helaman; Joneam; Korihor; Tubaloth.    \"Words of four syllables to be accented on the third syllable with the  following exceptions, which are to be accented on the second syllable;  namely: Abinadi; Abinidora; Amalickiah; Aminadi; Aminadab.    \"Ch is always to be pronounced as K.    \"G at the beginning of a name to be always pronounced 'hard.'    \"I final, always to take the long sound of the vowel.
