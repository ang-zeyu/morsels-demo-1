For over      40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the principle of      central planning and state ownership of the means of production. Albania      began fitful economic reforms during 1991, including the liberalization of      prices and trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform.      These reform measures were crippled, however, by the widespread civil      disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state. Following      their overwhelming victory in the 22 March 1991 elections, the new      Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the      economy and establish a market economy. In an effort to expand international      ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet      Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have      also passed legislation allowing foreign investment. Albania possesses      considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient      in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general      economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate      supplies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary      and subject to an especially wide margin of error.
