To add another worth to worth--              A new creation-bloom that rounds            The old creation, and expounds            His Beautiful in tuneful sounds.\"            CHAPTER I.    Chopin--Style and Improvements--The Adagio of the Second  Concerto--Funeral March--Psychological Character of the Compositions of  Chopin, &c., &c.      Deeply regretted as he may be by the whole body of artists, lamented by  all who have ever known him, we must still be permitted to doubt if  the time has even yet arrived in which he, whose loss is so peculiarly  deplored by ourselves, can be appreciated in accordance with his  just value, or occupy that high rank which in all probability will be  assigned him in the future.    If it has been often proved that \"no one is a prophet in his own  country;\" is it not equally true that the prophets, the men of the  future, who feel its life in advance, and prefigure it in their works,  are never recognized as prophets in their own times? It would be  presumptuous to assert that it can ever be otherwise. In vain may the  young generations of artists protest against the \"Anti-progressives,\"  whose invariable custom it is to assault and beat down the living with  the dead: time alone can test the real value, or reveal the hidden  beauties, either of musical compositions, or of kindred efforts in the  sister arts.    As the manifold forms of art are but different incantations, charged  with electricity from the soul of the artist, and destined to evoke  the latent emotions and passions in order to render them sensible,  intelligible, and, in some degree, tangible; so genius may be manifested  in the invention of new forms, adapted, it may be, to the expression  of feelings which have not yet surged within the limits of common  experience, and are indeed first evoked within the magic circle by the  creative power of artistic intuition. In arts in which sensation is  linked to emotion, without the intermediate assistance of thought and  reflection, the mere introduction of unaccustomed forms, of unused  modes, must present an obstacle to the immediate comprehension of any  very original composition. The surprise, nay, the fatigue, caused by  the novelty of the singular impressions which it awakens, will make it  appear to many as if written in a language of which they were ignorant,  and which that reason will in itself be sufficient to induce them to  pronounce a barbarous dialect. The trouble of accustoming the ear to it  will repel many who will, in consequence, refuse to make a study of it.  Through the more vivid and youthful organizations, less enthralled  by the chains of habit; through the more ardent spirits, won first by  curiosity, then filled with passion for the new idiom, must it penetrate  and win the resisting and opposing public, which will finally catch the  meaning, the aim, the construction, and at last render justice to its  qualities, and acknowledge whatever beauty it may contain. Musicians who  do not restrict themselves within the limits of conventional routine,  have, consequently, more need than other artists of the aid of time.  They cannot hope that death will bring that instantaneous plus-value to  their works which it gives to those of the painters. No musician could  renew, to the profit of his manuscripts, the deception practiced by one  of the great Flemish painters, who, wishing in his lifetime to benefit  by his future glory, directed his wife to spread abroad the news of his  death, in order that the pictures with which he had taken care to cover  the walls of his studio, might suddenly increase in value!    Whatever may be the present popularity of any part of the productions of  one, broken, by suffering long before taken by death, it is nevertheless  to be presumed that posterity will award to his works an estimation of  a far higher character, of a much more earnest nature, than has hitherto  been awarded them. A high rank must be assigned by the future historians  of music to one who distinguished himself in art by a genius for melody  so rare, by such graceful and remarkable enlargements of the harmonic  tissue; and his triumph will be justly preferred to many of far more  extended surface, though the works of such victors may be played and  replayed by the greatest number of instruments, and be sung and resung  by passing crowds of Prime Donne.    In confining himself exclusively to the Piano, Chopin has, in our  opinion, given proof of one of the most essential qualities of a  composer--a just appreciation of the form in which he possessed  the power to excel; yet this very fact, to which we attach so much  importance, has been injurious to the extent of his fame. It would have  been most difficult for any other writer, gifted with such high harmonic  and melodic powers, to have resisted the temptation of the SINGING of  the bow, the liquid sweetness of the flute, or the deafening swells of  the trumpet, which we still persist in believing the only fore-runner  of the antique goddess from whom we woo the sudden favors. What strong  conviction, based upon reflection, must have been requisite to have  induced him to restrict himself to a circle apparently so much more  barren; what warmth of creative genius must have been necessary to have  forced from its apparent aridity a fresh growth of luxuriant bloom,  unhoped for in such a soil! What intuitive penetration is repealed by  this exclusive choice, which, wresting the different effects of the  various instruments from their habitual domain, where the whole foam of  sound would have broken at their feet, transported them into a sphere,  more limited, indeed, but far more idealized! What confident perception  of the future powers of his instrument must have presided over his  voluntary renunciation of an empiricism, so widely spread, that another  would have thought it a mistake, a folly, to have wrested such great  thoughts from their ordinary interpreters! How sincerely should we  revere him for this devotion to the Beautiful for its own sake, which  induced him not to yield to the general propensity to scatter each light  spray of melody over a hundred orchestral desks, and enabled him to  augment the resources of art, in teaching how they may be concentrated  in a more limited space, elaborated at less expense of means, and  condensed in time!    Far from being ambitious of the uproar of an orchestra, Chopin was  satisfied to see his thought integrally produced upon the ivory of the  key-board; succeeding in his aim of losing nothing in power, without  pretending to orchestral effects, or to the brush of the scene-painter.  Oh! we have not yet studied with sufficient earnestness and attention  the designs of his delicate pencil, habituated as we are, in these  days, to consider only those composers worthy of a great name, who have  written at least half-a-dozen Operas, as many Oratorios, and various  Symphonies: vainly requiring every musician to do every thing, nay, a  little more than every thing. However widely diffused this idea may be,  its justice is, to say the least, highly problematical. We are far  from contesting the glory more difficult of attainment, or the real  superiority of the Epic poets, who display their splendid creations upon  so large a plan; but we desire that material proportion in music should  be estimated by the same measure which is applied to dimension in other  branches of the fine arts; as, for example, in painting, where a canvas  of twenty inches square, as the Vision of Ezekiel, or Le Cimetiere by  Ruysdael, is placed among the chefs d'oeuvre, and is more highly valued  than pictures of a far larger size, even though they might be from the  hands of a Rubens or a Tintoret. In literature, is Beranger less a great  poet, because he has condensed his thoughts within the narrow limits  of his songs? Does not Petrarch owe his fame to his Sonnets? and among  those who most frequently repeat their soothing rhymes, how many know  any thing of the existence of his long poem on Africa? We cannot doubt  that the prejudice which would deny the superiority of an artist--though  he should have produced nothing but such Sonatas as Franz Schubert has  given us--over one who has portioned out the insipid melodies of many  Operas, which it were useless to cite, will disappear; and that in  music, also, we will yet take into account the eloquence and ability  with which the thoughts and feelings are expressed, whatever may be  the size of the composition in which they are developed, or the means  employed to interpret them.    In making an analysis of the works of Chopin, we meet with beauties of a  high order, expressions entirely new, and a harmonic tissue as original  as erudite. In his compositions, boldness is always justified; richness,  even exuberance, never interferes with clearness; singularity never  degenerates into uncouth fantasticalness; the sculpturing is never  disorderly; the luxury of ornament never overloads the chaste eloquence  of the principal lines. His best works abound in combinations which  may be said to form an epoch in the handling of musical style. Daring,  brilliant and attractive, they disguise their profundity under so much  grace, their science under so many charms, that it is with difficulty  we free ourselves sufficiently from their magical enthrallment, to judge  coldly of their theoretical value.

Their  labour is wealth, not exhaustion; its produce independence and  content, not home-sickness and despair. What the Backwoods of  Canada are to the industrious and ever-to-be-honoured sons of  honest poverty, and what they are to the refined and accomplished  gentleman, these simple sketches will endeavour to portray. They  are drawn principally from my own experience, during a sojourn of  nineteen years in the colony.    In order to diversify my subject, and make it as amusing as  possible, I have between the sketches introduced a few small poems,  all written during my residence in Canada, and descriptive of the  country.    In this pleasing task, I have been assisted by my husband, J. W.  Dunbar Moodie, author of \"Ten Years in South Africa.\"    BELLEVILLE, UPPER CANADA          CANADA      Canada, the blest--the free!    With prophetic glance, I see    Visions of thy future glory,    Giving to the world's great story    A page, with mighty meaning fraught,    That asks a wider range of thought.    Borne onward on the wings of Time,    I trace thy future course sublime;    And feel my anxious lot grow bright,    While musing on the glorious sight;--    My heart rejoicing bounds with glee    To hail thy noble destiny!      Even now thy sons inherit    All thy British mother's spirit.    Ah! no child of bondage thou;    With her blessing on thy brow,    And her deathless, old renown    Circling thee with freedom's crown,    And her love within thy heart,    Well may'st thou perform thy part,    And to coming years proclaim    Thou art worthy of her name.    Home of the homeless!--friend to all    Who suffer on this earthly ball!    On thy bosom sickly care    Quite forgets her squalid lair;    Gaunt famine, ghastly poverty    Before thy gracious aspect fly,    And hopes long crush'd, grow bright again,    And, smiling, point to hill and plain.      By thy winter's stainless snow,    Starry heavens of purer glow,    Glorious summers, fervid, bright,    Basking in one blaze of light;    By thy fair, salubrious clime;    By thy scenery sublime;    By thy mountains, streams, and woods;    By thy everlasting floods;    If greatness dwells beneath the skies,    Thou to greatness shalt arise!      Nations old, and empires vast,    From the earth had darkly pass'd    Ere rose the fair auspicious morn    When thou, the last, not least, wast born.    Through the desert solitude    Of trackless waters, forests rude,    Thy guardian angel sent a cry    All jubilant of victory!    \"Joy,\" she cried, \"to th' untill'd earth,    Let her joy in a mighty birth,--    Night from the land has pass'd away,    The desert basks in noon of day.    Joy, to the sullen wilderness,    I come, her gloomy shades to bless,    To bid the bear and wild-cat yield    Their savage haunts to town and field.    Joy, to stout hearts and willing hands,    That win a right to these broad lands,    And reap the fruit of honest toil,    Lords of the rich, abundant soil.      \"Joy, to the sons of want, who groan    In lands that cannot feed their own;    And seek, in stern, determined mood,    Homes in the land of lake and wood,    And leave their hearts' young hopes behind,    Friends in this distant world to find;    Led by that God, who from His throne    Regards the poor man's stifled moan.    Like one awaken'd from the dead,    The peasant lifts his drooping head,    Nerves his strong heart and sunburnt hand,    To win a potion of the land,    That glooms before him far and wide    In frowning woods and surging tide    No more oppress'd, no more a slave,    Here freedom dwells beyond the wave.      \"Joy, to those hardy sires who bore    The day's first heat--their toils are o'er;    Rude fathers of this rising land,    Theirs was a mission truly grand.    Brave peasants whom the Father, God,    Sent to reclaim the stubborn sod;    Well they perform'd their task, and won    Altar and hearth for the woodman's son.    Joy, to Canada's unborn heirs,    A deathless heritage is theirs;    For, sway'd by wise and holy laws,    Its voice shall aid the world's great cause,    Shall plead the rights of man, and claim    For humble worth an honest name;    Shall show the peasant-born can be,    When call'd to action, great and free.    Like fire, within the flint conceal'd,    By stern necessity reveal'd,    Kindles to life the stupid sod,    Image of perfect man and God.      \"Joy, to thy unborn sons, for they    Shall hail a brighter, purer day;    When peace and Christian brotherhood    Shall form a stronger tie than blood--    And commerce, freed from tax and chain,    Shall build a bridge o'er earth and main;    And man shall prize the wealth of mind,    The greatest blessing to mankind;    True Christians, both in word and deed,    Ready in virtue's cause to bleed,    Against a world combined to stand,    And guard the honour of the land.    Joy, to the earth, when this shall be,    Time verges on eternity.\"          CHAPTER I    A VISIT TO GROSSE ISLE        Alas! that man's stern spirit e'er should mar    A scene so pure--so exquisite as this.      The dreadful cholera was depopulating Quebec and Montreal when our  ship cast anchor off Grosse Isle, on the 30th of August 1832, and  we were boarded a few minutes after by the health-officers.    One of these gentlemen--a little, shrivelled-up Frenchman--from  his solemn aspect and attenuated figure, would have made no bad  representative of him who sat upon the pale horse. He was the only  grave Frenchman I had ever seen, and I naturally enough regarded  him as a phenomenon. His companion--a fine-looking fair-haired  Scotchman--though a little consequential in his manners, looked  like one who in his own person could combat and vanquish all the  evils which flesh is heir to. Such was the contrast between these  doctors, that they would have formed very good emblems, one, of  vigorous health, the other, of hopeless decay.    Our captain, a rude, blunt north-country sailor, possessing  certainly not more politeness than might be expected in a bear,  received his sprucely dressed visitors on the deck, and, with very  little courtesy, abruptly bade them follow him down into the cabin.    The officials were no sooner seated, than glancing hastily round  the place, they commenced the following dialogue:--    \"From what port, captain?\"    Now, the captain had a peculiar language of his own, from which he  commonly expunged all the connecting links. Small words, such as  \"and\" and \"the,\" he contrived to dispense with altogether.    \"Scotland--sailed from port o' Leith, bound for Quebec, Montreal--  general cargo--seventy-two steerage, four cabin passengers--brig  Anne, one hundred and ninety-two tons burden, crew eight hands.\"    Here he produced his credentials, and handed them to the strangers.  The Scotchman just glanced over the documents, and laid them on the  table.    \"Had you a good passage out?\"    \"Tedious, baffling winds, heavy fogs, detained three weeks on  Banks--foul weather making Gulf--short of water, people out of  provisions, steerage passengers starving.\"    \"Any case of sickness or death on board?\"    \"All sound as crickets.\"    \"Any births?\" lisped the little Frenchman.    The captain screwed up his mouth, and after a moment's reflection  he replied, \"Births? Why, yes; now I think on't, gentlemen, we had  one female on board, who produced three at a birth.\"    \"That's uncommon,\" said the Scotch doctor, with an air of lively  curiosity. \"Are the children alive and well? I should like much to  see them.\" He started up, and knocked his head--for he was very  tall--against the ceiling. \"Confound your low cribs! I have nearly  dashed out my brains.\"    \"A hard task, that,\" looked the captain to me. He did not speak,  but I knew by his sarcastic grin what was uppermost in his  thoughts. \"The young ones all males--fine thriving fellows. Step  upon deck, Sam Frazer,\" turning to his steward; \"bring them down  for doctors to see.\" Sam vanished, with a knowing wink to his  superior, and quickly returned, bearing in his arms three fat,  chuckle-headed bull-terriers, the sagacious mother following  close at his heels, and looked ready to give and take offence on  the slightest provocation.    \"Here, gentlemen, are the babies,\" said Frazer, depositing his  burden on the floor. \"They do credit to the nursing of the brindled  slut.\"    The old tar laughed, chuckled, and rubbed his hands in an ecstacy  of delight at the indignation and disappointment visible in the  countenance of the Scotch Esculapius, who, angry as he was, wisely  held his tongue. Not so the Frenchman; his rage scarcely knew  bounds--he danced in a state of most ludicrous excitement, he  shook his fist at our rough captain, and screamed at the top of his  voice--    \"Sacre, you bete! You tink us dog, ven you try to pass your puppies  on us for babies?\"    \"Hout, man, don't be angry,\" said the Scotchman, stifling a laugh;  \"you see 'tis only a joke!\"    \"Joke! me no understand such joke. Bete!\" returned the angry  Frenchman, bestowing a savage kick on one of the unoffending pups  which was frisking about his feet. The pup yelped; the slut barked  and leaped furiously at the offender, and was only kept from biting  him by Sam, who could scarcely hold her back for laughing; the  captain was uproarious; the offended Frenchman alone maintained  a severe and dignified aspect. The dogs were at length dismissed,  and peace restored.    After some further questioning from the officials, a Bible was  required for the captain to take an oath. Mine was mislaid, and  there was none at hand.    \"Confound it!\" muttered the old sailor, tossing over the papers  in his desk; \"that scoundrel, Sam, always stows my traps out of  the way.\" Then taking up from the table a book which I had been  reading, which happened to be Voltaire's History of Charles"]]]
