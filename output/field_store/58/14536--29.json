These mills were about one-half  mile apart and it was about these mills and along the mill races and  ponds of these mills that I set my first traps for muskrats, mink and  coon. Before I was stout enough to set a trap which was strong enough  to hold the varmint, it was necessary for me to get some older person  to set the trap. I would take the trap to the intended place and set  for the particular animals I was in quest of, whether mink, coon or  rat.    In those days clearings were small, woods large and full of game.  Deer could be seen in bunches every morning in the fields and it was  not uncommon to see a bear's track near the house that had been made  during the night. Wolves were not plenty though it was a common thing  to see their tracks and sometimes hear them howl on the hills.    Like other boys who lead an outdoor life, I grew stronger each year  and as I grew older and stronger my trap lines grew longer and my  hunts took me farther into the woods. Finally as game became scarcer  my hunts grew from a few hours in length to weeks and months camping  in a cabin built in the woods in a section where game was plenty.    At the age of thirteen while out with a party of men on a hunting and  fishing trip, I killed my first bear. While I had now been out each  fall with my traps and gun, it was not until I was about eighteen  years old that I took my first lesson from an old and experienced  trapper, a man nearly eighty years old and a trapper and hunter from  boyhood. The man's name was Aleck Harris. We made our camp in the  extreme southeastern part of this (Potter) County in a section known  as \"The Black Forest\" and it was here that I learned many things from  an experienced trapper and hunter that served me well on the trap  line and the trail, in the years that followed.    It was here that I made my first bed in a foot or more of snow with a  fire against a fallen tree and a few boughs thrown on the ground for  a bed. At other times perhaps a bear skin just removed from the bear  for covering, or I might have no covering other than to remove my  coat and spread it over me. This I have often done when belated on  the trail so that I was unable to reach the cabin and was happy and  contented.    It was here I first learned to do up the saddles or the carcass of a  deer in the more convenient way to carry. It was here that I took my  first practical lessons in skinning, stretching, curing and handling  of skins and furs. I also learned many things of traps and trapping  and to do away with sheath knives and other unnecessary burdens on  the trap line. In my younger days I preferred to \"go it alone\" when  in a country that I was familiar with and many a week I have spent in  my cabin alone save for my faithful dog, but as I grew older and  became afflicted with rheumatism I have found a partner more  acceptable.    I have met with many queer circumstances while on the trap line and  trail, yet I have never met with any of those bloodcurdling and  hair-breadth escapes from wild animals which are mostly \"pipe dreams\".  Perhaps the nearest I ever came to being seriously hurt by a wild  animal was from a large buck deer. It was in November and on a stormy  day. I had killed a doe and was in the act of dressing the doe and  was leaning over the deer at work. I was within a few feet of a  fallen tree. Hearing a slight noise, I raised up to see what caused  it, when with the speed of a cannon ball a buck flew past me, barely  missing and landed six or eight feet beyond me.    The deer had come up to this fallen tree on the track of the doe and  seeing me at work over the doe, became angered and sprung at me and  only my straightening up at the very instant that I did saved me from  being seriously hurt or perhaps killed. I sprang over the log. The  deer stood and gazed at me for a moment. His eyes were of a green hue  and the hair on his back all stuck up towards his head. After gazing  at me for a moment the deer walked slowly away. The suddenness of the  occurrence so unnerved me that I was unable to shoot for some minutes  though my gun was standing against the tree within reach.    At another time I was somewhat frightened by what I supposed was a  dead bear suddenly coming to life. I had caught the bear in a trap  and it had got fastened in some saplings growing on the steep bank of  a small brook. I shot the bear in the head, as I thought, and it fell  over the bank in such a manner that his whole weight was held by the  leg that was fast in the trap. I was unable to release it from the  trap where it was hanging as I had no clamp to put the trap springs  down with, to release the bear's foot. I had set my gun, a single  barrel rifle, against a tree without reloading it.    I cut the bear's paw off close to the trap which allowed the animal  to roll down the bank to level ground. I had begun to rip down the  leg that had been caught in the trap. A lad of about ten years was  with me having accompanied me to attend the traps that day. The lad  stood looking on when all of a sudden he said, \"See him wink.\" I  stopped my work and glanced at the bear's eyes and sure enough he was  winking and winking fast, too, and almost before I knew it the bear  was trying to get onto his feet. My gun was unloaded and the lad was  screaming at the top of his voice, \"Kill him! Kill him!\" But what was  I to kill him with? Nothing came to my mind at first except to use my  gun as a club but I did not like to break it.    In a moment I thought of my hatchet which I had taken from the  holster and laid on the bank where I had cut the bear's foot off to  release him from the trap. I grabbed the hatchet and one good blow on  the head put a stop to the rumpus and nobody harmed, although the boy  was badly frightened.    At another time I might have got into trouble with a bear also caught  in a trap. I was quite young at this time. I had gone some ten or  twelve miles from home and set a trap for a bear. The trap was rather  a poor one with a very light chain for a bear trap. I had only set  the trap a few days before yet I thought I must go and look after it,  but it was more the desire to be in the woods than it was of  expecting to have a bear in the trap at that time. I did not take a  gun with me, only a revolver loaded as I had no more balls and this  was before the days of fixed ammunition.    When I came to the trap there was an ugly bear in it and he had the  clog fast in some roots and among some fallen trees. After firing one  shot at the Bear's head, which I missed, I then shot the two  remaining balls into the bear's body with the only effect of making  him more determined to get at me. I now cut a good club determined to  put a quietus on Bruin in that manner but after landing several blows  my knees began to feel weak. I gave up the job and returned home  leaving Bruin in the trap feeling as well as he did when I first  found him, so far as I was able to see. But when I returned the next  morning with help and now with a regular gun we found Bruin nearly  dead and helpless from the shots that I had given him the day before  from the revolver.    I have met with other circumstances not quite so fascinating as those  just related. At one time a young companion and I were camping and  trapping several miles from home and several miles from a road. One  day while we were some ways out from camp setting traps my friend  became suddenly very ill. It required no skilled doctor to see that  it was a case that must have help at once. I started with my friend  to get to camp. While my companion was not as old as I, he was larger  and heavier. I worked along with him, half carrying him, while he  would support himself as best he could. I got him within about a mile  of the cabin when he completely gave out and could go no farther and  with all my pleadings I could not get him to try to go any farther,  but he promised that if I went after help that after resting he would  work his way to camp.    Seeing that there was no other way to do, I left him and started for  help. It was now dark. My way was over a road of about twelve miles  and nearly all the way through a thick woods and part of the way  without a road other than a path. When I reached the cabin I stopped  long enough to build a fire so that the cabin would be warm when my  companion got there if he did get there at all, which I doubted.    I took a lunch in my hand and started for help. I would take a trot  whenever the woods were sufficiently open to let in light enough so  that I could see my way. I got to my companion's home about midnight  and we were soon on the way back with a team and wagon while my  companion's father went after a doctor to have him there when we got  back with the patient. We drove with the wagon as far as the road  would allow, then we left the wagon and rode the horses to the camp.    When we reached the cabin, contrary to expectations, we found my  companion there but very sick. We lost no time in getting him onto a  horse and starting for the wagon where we had a bed for the patient  to lie down on. We got home about eight o'clock in the morning. The  doctor was waiting for us and he said as soon as he looked at the man  that it was a bad case of typhoid fever. He was right, for it took  many weeks before my friend was able to be out again.    When game began to get scarce, that is when game was no longer found  plenty right at the door, I began to look for parts where game was  plentiful and accordingly, with three companions, I arranged to hunt  and trap on Thunder Bay River in Michigan, where deer and all kinds  of game, we had been told, were plenty and also lots of fur bearers.  This we found to be quite true but the state had passed a law  forbidding the shipment of deer. We did not know this when we left  home and two of the boys soon got discouraged and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#2)"],[1," wings, and,  straight as an arrow, it flew away over the sands and the waters toward  the doura-fields and Cairo.    And the sunset waned, and the afterglow flamed and faded, and the clear,  soft African night fell. The pilgrims who day by day visit the Sphinx,  like the bird, had gone back to Cairo. They had come, as the bird  had come; as those who have conquered Egypt came; as the Greeks came,  Alexander of Macedon, and the Ptolemies; as the Romans came; as the  Mamelukes, the Turks, the French, the English came.    They had come--and gone.    And that enormous face, with the stains of stormy red still adhering  to its cheeks, grew dark as the darkness closed in, turned brown as a  fellah's face, as the face of that fellah who whispered his secret in  the sphinx's ear, but learnt no secret in return; turned black almost  as a Nubian's face. The night accentuated its appearance of terrible  repose, of super-human indifference to whatever might befall. In the  night I seemed to hear the footsteps of the dead--of all the dead  warriors and the steeds they rode, defiling over the sand before the  unconquerable thing they perhaps thought that they had conquered. At  last the footsteps died away. There was a silence. Then, coming down  from the Great Pyramid, surely I heard the light patter of a donkey's  feet. They went to the Sphinx and ceased. The silence was profound.  And I remembered the legend that Mary, Joseph, and the Holy Child once  halted here on their long journey, and that Mary laid the tired Christ  between the paws of the Sphinx to sleep. Yet even of the Christ the soul  within that body could take no heed at all.    It is, I think, one of the most astounding facts in the history of  man that a man was able to contain within his mind, to conceive, the  conception of the Sphinx. That he could carry it out in the stone is  amazing. But how much more amazing it is that before there was the  Sphinx he was able to see it with his imagination! One may criticize the  Sphinx. One may say impertinent things that are true about it: that  seen from behind at a distance its head looks like an enormous mushroom  growing in the sand, that its cheeks are swelled inordinately, that  its thick-lipped mouth is legal, that from certain places it bears a  resemblance to a prize bull-dog. All this does not matter at all. What  does matter is that into the conception and execution of the Sphinx has  been poured a supreme imaginative power. He who created it looked beyond  Egypt, beyond the life of man. He grasped the conception of Eternity,  and realized the nothingness of Time, and he rendered it in stone.    I can imagine the most determined atheist looking at the Sphinx and, in  a flash, not merely believing, but feeling that he had before him proof  of the life of the soul beyond the grave, of the life of the soul of  Khufu beyond the tomb of his Pyramid. Always as you return to the Sphinx  you wonder at it more, you adore more strangely its repose, you steep  yourself more intimately in the aloof peace that seems to emanate from  it as light emanates from the sun. And as you look on it at last perhaps  you understand the infinite; you understand where is the bourne to which  the finite flows with all its greatness, as the great Nile flows from  beyond Victoria Nyanza to the sea.    And as the wonder of the Sphinx takes possession of you gradually, so  gradually do you learn to feel the majesty of the Pyramids of Ghizeh.  Unlike the Step Pyramid of Sakkara, which, even when one is near it,  looks like a small mountain, part of the land on which it rests, the  Pyramids of Ghizeh look what they are--artificial excrescences, invented  and carried out by man, expressions of man's greatness. Exquisite as  they are as features of the drowsy golden landscape at the setting of  the sun, I think they look most wonderful at night, when they are black  beneath the stars. On many nights I have sat in the sand at a distance  and looked at them, and always, and increasingly, they have stirred  my imagination. Their profound calm, their classical simplicity, are  greatly emphasized when no detail can be seen, when they are but black  shapes towering to the stars. They seem to aspire then like prayers  prayed by one who has said, \"God does not need any prayers, but I need  them.\" In their simplicity they suggest a crowd of thoughts and of  desires. Guy de Maupassant has said that of all the arts architecture is  perhaps the most aesthetic, the most mysterious, and the most nourished  by ideas. How true this is you feel as you look at the Great Pyramid by  night. It seems to breathe out mystery. The immense base recalls to you  the labyrinth within; the long descent from the tiny slit that gives you  entrance, your uncertain steps in its hot, eternal night, your falls  on the ice-like surfaces of its polished blocks of stone, the crushing  weight that seemed to lie on your heart as you stole uncertainly on,  summoned almost as by the desert; your sensation of being for ever  imprisoned, taken and hidden by a monster from Egypt's wonderful light,  as you stood in the central chamber, and realized the stone ocean into  whose depths, like some intrepid diver, you had dared deliberately to  come. And then your eyes travel up the slowly shrinking walls till they  reach the dark point which is the top. There you stood with Abou, who  spends half his life on the highest stone, hostages of the sun, bathed  in light and air that perhaps came to you from the Gold Coast. And  you saw men and camels like flies, and Cairo like a grey blur, and the  Mokattam hills almost as a higher ridge of the sands. The mosque of  Mohammed Ali was like a cup turned over. Far below slept the dead in  that graveyard of the Sphinx, with its pale stones, its sand, its palm,  its \"Sycamores of the South,\" once worshipped and regarded as Hathor's  living body. And beyond them on one side were the sleeping waters, with  islands small, surely, as delicate Egyptian hands, and on the other the  great desert that stretches, so the Bedouins say, on and on \"for a march  of a thousand days.\"    That base and that summit--what suggestion and what mystery in their  contrast! What sober, eternal beauty in the dark line which unites them,  now sharply, yet softly, defined against the night, which is purple as  the one garment of the fellah! That line leads the soul irresistibly  from earth to the stars.          III    SAKKARA    It was the \"Little Christmas\" of the Egyptians as I rode to Sakkara,  after seeing a wonderful feat, the ascent and descent of the second  Pyramid in nineteen minutes by a young Bedouin called Mohammed Ali who  very seriously informed me that the only Roumi who had ever reached the  top was an \"American gentlemens\" called Mark Twain, on his first visit  to Egypt. On his second visit, Ali said, Mr. Twain had a bad foot, and  declared he could not be bothered with the second Pyramid. He had been  up and down without a guide; he had disturbed the jackal which lives  near its summit, and which I saw running in the sunshine as Ali drew  near its lair, and he was satisfied to rest on his immortal laurels. To  the Bedouins of the Pyramids Mark Twain's world-wide celebrity is owing  to one fact alone: he is the only Roumi who has climbed the second  Pyramid. That is why his name is known to every one.    It was the \"Little Christmas,\" and from the villages in the plain the  Egyptians came pouring out to visit their dead in the desert cemeteries  as I passed by to visit the dead in the tombs far off on the horizon.  Women, swathed in black, gathered in groups and jumped monotonously up  and down, to the accompaniment of stained hands clapping, and strange  and weary songs. Tiny children blew furiously into tin trumpets,  emitting sounds that were terribly European. Men strode seriously by,  or stood in knots among the graves, talking vivaciously of the things of  this life. As the sun rose higher in the heavens, this visit to the dead  became a carnival of the living. Laughter and shrill cries of merriment  betokened the resignation of the mourners. The sand-dunes were black  with running figures, racing, leaping, chasing one another, rolling over  and over in the warm and golden grains. Some sat among the graves and  ate. Some sang. Some danced. I saw no one praying, after the sun was up.  The Great Pyramid of Ghizeh was transformed in this morning hour, and  gleamed like a marble mountain, or like the hill covered with salt at  El-Outaya, in Algeria. As we went on it sank down into the sands, until  at last I could see only a small section with its top, which looked  almost as pointed as a gigantic needle. Abou was there on the hot stones  in the golden eye of the sun--Abou who lives to respect his Pyramid, and  to serve Turkish coffee to those who are determined enough to climb  it. Before me the Step Pyramid rose, brown almost as bronze, out of the  sands here desolate and pallid. Soon I was in the house of Marriette,  between the little sphinxes.    Near Cairo, although the desert is real desert, it does not give, to  me, at any rate, the immense impression of naked sterility, of almost  brassy, sun-baked fierceness, which often strikes one in the Sahara to  the south of Algeria, where at midday one sometimes has a feeling of  being lost upon a waste of metal, gleaming, angry, tigerish in color.  Here, in Egypt, both the people and the desert seem gentler, safer, more  amiable. Yet these tombs of Sakkara are hidden in a desolation of the  sands, peculiarly blanched and mournful; and as you wander from tomb to  tomb, descending and ascending, stealing through great galleries beneath  the sands, creeping through tubes of stone, crouching almost on hands  and knees in the sultry chambers of the dead, the awfulness of the  passing away of dynasties and of race comes, like a cloud, upon your  spirit. But this cloud lifts and floats from you in the cheerful"]]]
