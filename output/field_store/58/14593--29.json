[Illustration: U.S. MARINE HOSPITAL, BROOKLYN.]    The Marine Hospital at the Wallabout, Brooklyn, near the Navy Yard,  belongs to the government of the United States, and is intended for  the use of the sailors and officers of the navy, and none others. It  was built from a fund called the hospital fund, which is created by a  payment of twenty cents a month by all the officers and seamen of the  navy. The Hospital stands on high ground, on one of the healthiest and  pleasantest spots in the vicinity of New-York, commands a superb view  of the East River as it sweeps toward the Sound, and overlooks both  Brooklyn and New-York. The buildings constituting the Hospital are two  fine large airy edifices constructed of white marble, with galleries  and piazzas, and surrounded by well-kept grounds which abound with  choice fruit trees, and every requisite for the health and comfort of  the invalids. The patients remain there only while under treatment for  disease. Our government has no asylum for the support of the sailors  or soldiers who lose their health or limbs in its service, like the  hospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea, and, in this respect at least, we  are behind the government of Great Britain, which makes ample and  generous provision for all classes and grades of public servants.    As New-York was the first maritime city that built a chapel expressly  for seamen, so it was the first to build a floating church, for  although there had been previously in London and Liverpool old hulks  fitted up as chapels, and moored in the docks for the use of sailors,  there had never been an actual church edifice put afloat before the  FLOATING CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR, which now lies moored at the foot of  Pike-street, in the East River. This novel edifice was finished and  consecrated in February, 1844. It is under the charge of the Young  Men's Church Missionary Society of the City of New-York, by whom it  was built, and has been under the pastoral care of the Rev. B. C. C.  Parker, of the Episcopal church, from its consecration to the present  time. It is seventy feet long, and thirty feet wide, and will  comfortably seat five hundred persons. It has an end gallery, in which  is an organ. A beautiful baptismal font of white marble, in the shape  of a capstan, surmounted by a seashell, chiselled from the same block  with the shaft--the gift of St. Mark's church in the Bowery,  New-York--stands in front of the chancel rail. The top of the  communion-table is a marble slab, and the Ten Commandments are placed  on the panels on each side in the recess over it. An anchor in gold,  painted on the back-ground between these panels, rests upon the Bible  and prayer-book. The roof, at the apex, is twenty-six feet high, and  eleven feet at the eaves. The edifice is built on a broad deck,  seventy-six by thirty-six feet, covering two boats of eighty tons  each, placed ten feet apart. The spire contains a bell, and the top of  the flag-staff is about seventy feet from the deck. Divine service is  regularly performed on Sundays, commencing in the morning at half-past  ten, and in the afternoon at three o'clock. Both the boats on which  the edifice rests are well coppered, and protected from injury by  booms placed around them.    [Illustration: THE FLOATING CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR.]    A similar floating church has been built and moored near  Rector-street, in the North River, near which is another floating  chapel, formed of an old hulk, after the manner of the first floating  chapels in London. In addition to these houses of worship for seamen,  there is a large and handsome church for sailors near the \"Home,\" in  Cherry-street, under the charge of the Baptists, and a small seamen's  chapel in Brooklyn, near the Catharine Ferry. To complete this system  of benevolent enterprises for the benefit of sailors, there is a  Seaman's Savings Bank in Wall-street, a very handsome structure of  brown free-stone, in the third story of which are the offices of the  Seaman's Friend Society.    In Franklin Square, which, at the time of Washington's last visit to  New-York, bore about the same relation to the heart of the city that  Union Square and Grammercy Park now do, being the Ultima Thule of  fashion, and the very focus of gentility and aristocracy, there is the  Sailor's Home for colored seamen, which has been most respectably  conducted on the principle of the \"Home\" in Cherry-street, and under  the supervision of, although not belonging to, the Seaman's Friend  Society. The Colored Home consists of two respectable three-story  brick buildings, and is next door to the old Walton House, which is  the last remnant of ante-revolutionary splendor remaining in the  commercial metropolis of the Union, which once abounded in stately old  mansions full of historical mementoes of the days when we acknowledged  to kingly authority.    The principle of compelling men, when they have means, to lay up a  trifle against the exigencies of a rainy day, has worked well, as we  have seen, when applied to the most improvident of all the laboring  classes, and we are not sure but the same principle applied to other  classes would not prove equally beneficial. If the law should require  every author, or merchant, or broker, or editor, to pay a monthly  stipend to provide houses of refuge for the needy of their class, it  would be only carrying out the principle of government which has been  applied to seamen, and might save many a poor wretch from committing  suicide to avoid the fate of a pauper.    [Illustration: A CUB OF THE BARN-YARD]          RURAL LIFE IN VIRGINIA: THE \"SWALLOW BARN.\"      We remember no book of its class altogether more delightful than the  \"Swallow Barn\" of JOHN P. KENNEDY. In Irving's \"Bracebridge Hall\" we  have exquisite sketches of English homes, such sketches as could be  drawn only by that graceful and genial humorist, but Bracebridge Hall  is not in our own country, and we scarcely feel \"at our own\" in it, as  we do in every scene to which we are introduced by the author of  \"Swallow Barn,\" the best painter of manners who has ever tried his  hand at their delineation in America. The love of nature, the fine  appreciation of a country life, the delicate and quiet humor, and  hearty joy in every one's enjoyment, which those who know Mr. Kennedy  personally will recognize as principal elements of his own character,  are reflected in the pages of the book, and with its other good  qualities make it one of the most charming compositions in the  literature of the present time.    Mr. Putnam in a few days will publish a new edition of \"Swallow Barn,\"  profusely illustrated by Mr. Strother, an artist who seems perfectly  at home in the Old Dominion, as if--which may be the case--all his  life had been spent there. Some of these we shall transfer to our own  pages, but first we copy in full Mr. Kennedy's \"Word in Advance to the  Reader\":         \"Swallow Barn was written twenty years ago, and was       published in a small edition, which was soon exhausted. From       that date it has disappeared from the bookstores, being       carelessly consigned by the author to that oblivion which is       common to books and men--out of sight, out of mind. Upon a       recent reviewal of it, after an interval sufficiently long       to obliterate the partialities with which one is apt to       regard his own productions, I have thought it was worthy of       more attention than I had bestowed upon it, and was, at       least, entitled to the benefit of a second edition. In       truth, its republication has been so often advised by       friends, and its original reception was so prosperous, that       I have almost felt it to be a duty once more to set it       afloat upon the waters, for the behoof of that good-natured       company of idle readers who are always ready to embark on a       pleasure excursion in any light craft that offers. I have,       therefore, taken these volumes in hand, and given them a       somewhat critical revisal. Twenty years work sufficient       change upon the mind of an author to render him, perhaps       more than others, a fastidious critic of his own book. If       the physiologists are right, he is not the same person after       that lapse of time; and all that his present and former self       may claim in common, are those properties which belong to       his mental consciousness, of which his aspiration after fame       is one. The present self may, therefore, be expected to       examine more rigorously the work of that former and younger       person, for whom he is held responsible. This weighty       consideration will be sufficient to account for the few       differences which may be found between this and the first       edition. Some quaintness of the vocabulary has been got rid       of--some dialogue has been stript of its redundancy--some       few thoughts have been added--and others retrenched. I shall       be happy to think that the reader will agree with me that       these are improvements:--I mean the reader who may happen to       belong to that small and choice corps who read these volumes       long ago--a little troop of friends of both sexes, to whom I       have reason to be grateful for that modicum of good opinion       which cheered my first authorship. Health and joy to them       all--as many as are now alive! I owe them a thanksgiving for       their early benevolence.         \"Swallow Barn exhibits a picture of country life in       Virginia, as it existed in the first quarter of the present       century.

Its history, (#2)"],[1,"to elucidate it; and all these rays of light will  converge to a common centre, reflecting, we flatter ourselves, some  evident facts and practical truths.    This work on the contagious typhus of the ox is divided into four  principal parts.    The first part contains the history of this typhus from the remotest  times down to the present day. It is divided into several sections.    The second part, which gives the description of the disease, is  subdivided into four chapters.    The first chapter treats of general typhus, in order that a perfect  understanding may be arrived at as to the name and definition of the  particular distemper which affects the ox.    The second relates to the causes and origin of the disease.    The third treats of its symptoms, its progress, &c.    The fourth contains its mode of treatment.    The third part gives some plain instructions for the benefit of farmers,  cattle-dealers, and dairymen.    The fourth part gives a development of the scientific means and  safeguards to be adopted, in order that this country shall never relapse  into that state of helpless panic to which a want of preparation exposed  it when the present epizootia began its ravages.          FIRST PART.        _The History of the Contagious Typhus of the Ox, from the        remotest times down to the present day._      I.    General, local, and particular causes of destruction are constantly  reacting on organized creatures, and these causes account for those  _epiphytic_ diseases which infest plants, the _epizootic_ diseases which  spread mortality among the brute creation, and the _epidemic_, which  strike and are fatal to the human species. Thus it is that we  particularize at present, in the vegetable kingdom, the disease which  has attacked the vines, olive-trees, and potatoes; in the animal  kingdom, the silkworm sickness, and the cholera, and the typhoid fever  of cattle: so that we may safely say, that one or other of these  diseases is always, at a given moment, raging in some part of the globe  among some species of animal, either birds, pigs, horses, sheep, horned  cattle, or, in fine, attacks man himself.    When, however, the peccant invasion falls only on the vegetables and  animals situated at our antipodes, we seldom hear of the ravages it  commits; and when we do, forgetful of the affinity which links together  all the organic beings on the earth and their mutual dependence, nothing  can exceed the indifference we show to these calamities. Then, when the  danger threatens us nearer home, or when the evil has invaded us, we  have recourse to quarantine as the grand preservative to shield us. But  this preservative remedy is most frequently deceptive--a mere illusion;  for the real plague, typhus and cholera, borne along by the winds of  heaven, pass over the longest distances and the highest obstacles, and  baffle all our calculations; teaching us, by their successive returns,  that we shall continually be exposed to their destructive havoc so long  as we neglect to eradicate the evil at its original source, that is, in  those countries from which it emanates.    And this is the place to observe, that the cholera morbus threatens to  keep a permanent footing in the English possessions of India, because  the public works, by means of which the great rivers used to be confined  to their beds, have not of late been repaired and kept in good order in  those countries; owing to which neglect, their waters overflow the  plains, leaving, when they subside, those pestilential deposits which  afford a perpetual incubation to the cholera.    We are induced to dwell thus on the general causes of these diseases,  because the sick plants, on which dumb animals feed, and the sick  animals, on which man himself feeds, have a continual relation of cause  and effect; and we shall have to refer to this subject and give it  weight, when we come to speak of the treatment of these diseases.    It is an important fact, which deserves our most pointed attention and  consideration, that the vital resistance inherent in the animal frame to  withstand the attacks of these contagious diseases, is very far from  being the same throughout the whole kind. Man, in this respect, is the  most favoured and best fortified; he is able, without much  degenerating, to inhabit any latitude, to go with a sort of impunity, if  his calling require him to do so, amidst the most pestilential  emanations, and to continue for hours inhaling their baneful fumes. We  could quote many striking examples of this resisting power in man. But  there is one which we have recently witnessed, and which all can  appreciate. We refer to the slaughter-house of the great Metropolitan  Market. Here we saw, in lumps and fragments, every variety of corrupt  _detritus_ of animals which had been seized with the contagious typhus;  we saw the animals, too, being felled and slaughtered and dissected, in  a high temperature which rendered the air so poisonous that we could  hardly breathe it; yet amidst all this infection the workmen employed to  move and handle these revolting wrecks appeared indifferent to the  scene, and quite in their usual health. No living animal besides man  could stand such a trial; no other could breathe for hours, and day  after day, like these workmen, an atmosphere so charged with decomposing  impurities.    We say, therefore, that man may expose himself, with less danger to his  life than any other animal, to those pernicious causes which produce and  develop contagious diseases. Next to him, with respect to this power of  vital resistance, come the omnivorous animals, then the carnivorous, and  last of all, the herbivorous, in which this faculty is very feeble  indeed.    This prime consideration, to be fully understood and appreciated by  unscientific readers, would require explanations beyond the scope of  this work. Let us, however, for the present establish the fact, that  herbivorous animals, such as sheep and horned cattle, offer but a very  weak resistance to the causes which generate infectious and epizootic  diseases, and let us do our best to prove it by demonstration; for if  this truth be once admitted, we shall therefrom deduce that it is the  duty of man constantly to surround these frail and delicate creatures  with special care and attention, if he wishes to prevent their being  decimated from time to time, and if he would likewise avoid the  consequent injuries to himself--the loss of health and money accruing  from this deterioration.    So long as the herbivorous or grass-eating animal is properly fed; so  long as he browses on fat pastures; so long as his blood retains those  physiological elements which are the prime condition of health, he can,  and does, resist the causes of most contagious maladies. But if a hot  summer and a long continuance of dry weather chance to curtail, in  temperate zones, the usual abundance of his fodder, then comes the fatal  change: the blood is impoverished, the secretions are debilitated, a  strange languor runs through the system, the vital resistance is  unnerved, and he becomes an easy prey to those noxious influences which  were encountered before without injury whilst his provision was  abundant.    This is a fundamental matter. We therefore beg leave to support and  justify our argument by borrowing some additional evidence from prior  labours of ours, accomplished at the Ecole d'Alfort, near Paris,  conjointly with Professor Delafond, whose name has so often been cited  in the public journals in connexion with the cattle plague.    All vegetables and animals; with the exception of _adult_ men, whenever  their health declines from any cause (but more particularly from  paucity of food), spontaneously generate microscopic parasites, or very  minute insects, the germs of which are inherent in their system. A flock  of fleecy animals, wasted by deficient food in dry and parched meadows,  becomes attacked in due time by a parasitical cutaneous disease, known  as the _itch_, which is enough, if not checked, to destroy the whole.  Now, all that is required is to remove this flock to a more fertile  soil, where there is plenty to feed them, and the disease will disappear  of itself without any treatment. Deficiency of food destroys the health  of animals, and abundance of food overcomes disease in them.    A sheep affected by this parasitical disease may, without any fear, be  placed in a flock of healthy sheep, for he will not propagate the  distemper; but if instead of being sound and healthy, the flock is in a  weak declining state, this contaminated animal will diffuse the disease  with frightful rapidity, and may cause their entire destruction. These  facts may seem startling, but we are only speaking after the  incontestable authority of experiments.    We selected six healthy sheep, which we kept well supplied with  provisions; we covered these healthy sheep with parasites (acari). On  every one of these sound, well-fed sheep, the microscopic animalculae  died off without generating the cutaneous disease; for the blood, the  humours, and the skin of sound and healthy sheep constitute a soil  unfavourable to the propagation of these parasites, and actually starve  them to death.    After this first experiment, we subjected these six sheep to a deficient  diet; they grew lean, their blood was impoverished, and then all we had  to do was to lay upon them not thousands and thousands of these  parasites--as we had done in the first instance--but one solitary female  in a state of fecundity; and the parasitical distemper unfolded itself  so fiercely as to cause the death of three of these sheep on which the  test was allowed to run its course; whilst the other three sheep, having  been restored in time to a recoverable condition just as they were about  to drop off, were thoroughly cured, without any special treatment, by  the sole influence of good food and ordinary"]]]
