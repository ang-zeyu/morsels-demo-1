Whatever  powers are manifested throughout the world, those powers exist in  germ, in latency, in you. He, the Supreme, does not evolve. In  Him there are no additions or subtractions. His portions, the  Jivatmas, are as Himself, and they only unfold their powers in  matter as conditions around them draw those powers forth. If you  realize the unity of the Self amid the diversities of the  Not-Self, then Yoga will not seem an impossible thing to you.          The Quickening of the Process of Self-unfoldment        Educated and thoughtful men and women you already are; already  you have climbed up that long ladder which separates the present  outer form of the Deity in you from His form in the dust. The  manifest Deity sleeps in the mineral and the stone. He becomes  more and more unfolded in vegetables and animals, and lastly in  man He has reached what appears as His culmination to ordinary  men. Having done so much, shall you not do more ? With the  consciousness so far unfolded, does it seem impossible that it  should unfold in the future into the Divine?    As you realize that the laws of the evolution of form and of the  unfolding of consciousness in the universe and man are the same,  and that it is through these laws that the yogi brings out his  hidden powers, then you will understand also that it is not  necessary to go into the mountain or into the desert, to hide  yourself in a cave or a forest, in order that the union with the  Self may be obtainedÄHe who is within you and without you.  Sometimes for a special purpose seclusion may be useful. It may  be well at times to retire temporarily from the busy haunts of  men. But in the universe planned by Isvara, in order that the  powers of the Self may be brought outÄthere is your best field  for Yoga, planned with Divine wisdom and sagacity. The world is  meant for the unfolding of the Self: why should you then seek to  run away from it? Look at Shri Krishna Himself in that great  Upanishad of yoga, the Bhagavad-Gita. He spoke it out on a  battle-field, and not on a mountain peak. He spoke it to a  Kshattriya ready to fight, and not to a Brahmana quietly retired  from the world. The Kurukshetra of the world is the field of  Yoga. They who cannot face the world have not the strength to  face the difficulties of Yoga practice. If the outer world  out-wearies your powers, how do you expect to conquer the  difficulties of the inner life? If you cannot climb over the  little troubles of the world, how can you hope to climb over the  difficulties that a yogi has to scale? Those men blunder, who  think that running away from the world is the road to victory,  and that peace can be found only in certain localities.    As a matter of fact, you have practised Yoga unconsciously in the  past, even before your self- consciousness had separated itself,  was aware of itself. Sand knew itself to be different, in  temporary matter at least, from all the others that surround it.  And that is the first idea that you should take up and hold  firmly: Yoga is only a quickened process of the ordinary  unfolding of consciousness.    Yoga may then be defined as the \"rational application of the laws  of the unfolding of consciousness in an individual case\". That is  what is meant by the methods of Yoga. You study the laws' of the  unfolding of consciousness in the universe, you then apply them  to a special caseÄand that case is your own. You cannot apply  them to another. They must be self-applied. That is the definite  principle to grasp. So we must add one more word to our  definition: \"Yoga is the rational application of the laws of the  unfolding of consciousness, self-applied in an individual case.\"          Yoga Is a Science        Next, Yoga is a science. That is the second thing to grasp. Yoga  is a science, and not a vague, dreamy drifting or imagining. It  is an applied science, a systematized collection of laws applied  to bring about a definite end. It takes up the laws of  psychology, applicable to the unfolding of the whole  consciousness of man on every plane, in every world, and applies  those rationally in a particular case. This rational application  of the laws of unfolding consciousness acts exactly on the same  principles that you see applied around you every day in other  departments of science.    You know, by looking at the world around you, how enormously the  intelligence of man, co-operating with nature, may quicken  \"natural\" processes, and the working of intelligence is as  \"natural\" as anything else. We make this distinction, and  practically it is a real one, between \"rational\" and \"natural\"  growth, because human intelligence can guide the working of  natural laws; and when we come to deal with Yoga, we are in the  same department of applied science as, let us say, is the  scientific farmer or gardener, when he applies the natural laws  of selection to breeding. The farmer or gardener cannot transcend  the laws of nature, nor can he work against them. He has no other  laws of nature to work with save universal laws by which nature  is evolving forms around us, and yet he does in a few years what  nature takes, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of years to do. And  how? By applying human intelligence to choose the laws that serve  him and to neutralize the laws that hinder. He brings the divine  intelligence in man to utilise the divine powers in nature that  are working for general rather than for particular ends.    Take the breeder of pigeons. Out of the blue rock pigeon he  develops the pouter or the fan-tail; he chooses out, generation  after generation, the forms that show most strongly the  peculiarity that he wishes to develop. He mates such birds  together, takes every favouring circumstance into consideration  and selects again and again, and so on and on, till the  peculiarity that he wants to establish has become a well-marked  feature. Remove his controlling intelligence, leave the birds to  themselves, and they revert to the ancestral type.    Or take the case of the gardener. Out of the wild rose of the  hedge has been evolved every rose of the garden. Many-petalled  roses are but the result of the scientific culture of the  five-petalled rose of the hedgerow, the wild product of nature. A  gardener who chooses the pollen from one plant and places it on  the carpers of another is simply doing deliberately what is done  every day by the bee and the fly. But he chooses his plants, and  he chooses those that have the qualities he wants intensified,  and from those again he chooses those that show the desired  qualities still more clearly, until he has produced a flower so  different from the original stock that only by tracing it back  can you tell the stock whence it sprang.    So is it in the application of the laws of psychology that we  call Yoga. Systematized knowledge of the unfolding of  consciousness applied to the individualized Self, that is Yoga.  As I have just said, it is by the world that consciousness has  been unfolded, and the world is admirably planned by the LOGOS  for this unfolding of consciousness; hence the would-be yogi,  choosing out his objects and applying his laws, finds in the  world exactly the things he wants to make his practice of Yoga  real, a vital thing, a quickening process for the knowledge of  the Self. There are many laws. You can choose those which you  require, you can evade those you do not require, you can utilize  those you need, and thus you can bring about the result that  nature, without that application of human intelligence, cannot so  swiftly effect.    Take it, then, that Yoga is within your reach, with your powers,  and that even some of the lower practices of Yoga, some of the  simpler applications of the laws of the unfolding of  consciousness to yourself, will benefit you in this world as well  as in all others. For you are really merely quickening your  growth, your unfolding, taking advantage of the powers nature  puts within your hands, and deliberately eliminating the  conditions which would not help you in your work, but rather  hinder your march forward. If you see it in that light, it seems  to me that Yoga will be to you a far more real, practical thing,  than it is when you merely read some fragments about it taken  from Sanskrit books, and often mistranslated into English, and  you will begin to feel that to be a yogi is not necessarily a  thing for a life far off, an incarnation far removed from the  present one.          Man a Duality        Some of the terms used in Yoga are necessarily to be known. For  Yoga takes man for a special purpose and studies him for a  special end and, therefore, only troubles itself about two great  facts regarding man, mind and body. First, he is a unit, a unit  of consciousness. That is a point to be definitely grasped. There  is only one of him in each set of envelopes, and sometimes the  Theosophist has to revise his ideas about man when he begins this  practical line. Theosophy quite usefully and rightly, for the  understanding of the human constitution, divides man into many  parts and pieces. We talk of physical, astral, mental, etc. Or we  talk about Sthula-sarira, Sukshma-sarira, Karana-sarira, and so  on. Sometimes we divide man into Anna-maya-kosa, Prana-maya-kosa,  Mano-maya-kosa, etc. We divide man into so many pieces in order  to study him thoroughly, that we can hardly find the man because  of the pieces. This is, so to say, for the study of human anatomy  and physiology.    But Yoga is practical and psychological. I am not complaining of  the various sub-divisions of other systems. They are necessary  for the purpose of those systems. But Yoga, for its practical  purposes, considers man simply as a dualityÄmind and body, a unit  of consciousness in a set of envelopes. This is not the duality  of the Self and the Not-Self. For in Yoga, \"Self\" includes  consciousness plus such matter as it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4290"],[0,"The Dominion in 1983 (#2)"],[1,"Atlantic. Canada was affected detrimentally  by losing for a time the prestige consequent on being backed up  by British ironclads and regiments, every available soldier and  every vessel of war being required for the protection of British  interests nearer home.    The harvest again in 1886 was below the average. Trade and finance  had not recovered from the shock of the previous year. The outlook  was certainly gloomy.    A Conservative government, with Sir --- ---, as Premier, was in  power at Ottawa. Sir --- and his government were, however, in  great straits, owing to the prevailing depression throughout the  Dominion, for the hard times were seized upon by the opponents  of the government as a means whereby to thwart and distract the  ministers, and stir up discontent among the people. The States were  pointed to by the Reformers as the only country in the world where  security and prosperity co-existed. British connection was held up  to scorn as a tie whose supposed advantages had proved worthless. A  less able or a less determined ministry would have collapsed under  the strain. The winter of 1886-7 was very severe, and discontent  began to be noisy and aggressive. To make matters worse, a Fenian  organization was going on in the States with the avowed object of  invading Canada in the coming Spring. The heads of the movement  were well-known politicians of a low order, having considerable  funds at their command, and much influence in certain quarters.  Their emissaries were known to be working all over Canada, freely  distributing American gold and holding secret meetings. The  position of affairs was one of increasing gravity owing to the  connivance of the American authorities and the powerlessness of the  Home Government. So matters progressed until the spring of 1887,  when the situation became one of extreme tension. The Conservatives  were taunted with having ruined the country financially and with  pursuing a \"Jingo\" policy certain to end in bloodshed. Reformers  \"stumped\" the country, calling on their excited audiences to march  to Ottawa and compel the Premier and his infatuated followers to  resign. Annexation was openly advocated as the only sensible way  to be relieved from the overwhelming surrounding difficulties.    A ray of hope to buoy up the sorely-tried loyalists appeared,  when Canadians who had been domiciled in all parts of the States  returned to defend their native land on hearing of the great danger  she was undoubtedly in. Having lived many years under the shadow of  the Stars and Stripes, they knew well enough all that it amounted  to; the glamour of accumulated successes had not turned their heads  for they had had opportunities of observing the sinister influences  at work in American affairs, beneath the attractive exterior.  Quebec rallied to a man, and the latent military strength of the  province was developed under efficient leaders to a formidable  degree. Invaders would have met with a warm reception in this  quarter. Manitoba and the whole North-west were up and ready,  prepared to fight, more to preserve their own independence,  however, than the integrity of the Dominion, as there was then  considerable difference in sentiment between the North-west and  the Eastern Provinces. The Manitobans, too, though the Irish  element had become very strong, did not intend to succumb to Fenian  raiders, however well organized and backed up. The weakest points  were the Maritime Provinces, Ontario and British Columbia; not that  the feeling in British Columbia was not loyal to the Dominion, but  that some 30,000 rowdies who had assembled and organized in San  Francisco were preparing for a descent upon her poorly fortified  ports. Now was the turning point in the destinies of the country.  If the ministers at Ottawa had not stood firmly to their guns,  all our subsequent career, instead of being the golden century  of magnificent progress and peace that it has been, would have  been linked with all the turbulence and the alternate advance  and retrogression of the States.    A general election for the Dominion had been timed to take place  in the beginning of June, and the day was looked forward to by all  the noisy demagogues of Ontario as the day when the blood-thirsty  Tories were to be hurled from power by the people in righteous  wrath, and the country saved from the horrors of war. According to  these garrulous parties, Ontario, the wealthiest and most populous  Province of the seven, was to welcome the invaders, bidding them  enter Canadian territory in the name of the people, and plant the  Stars and Stripes wherever they halted. Bloodshed would thus be  avoided, and everyone would soon come round to the new order of  things and take to it naturally. Quebec might perhaps object,  \"but what did a few handfuls of Frenchmen matter anyway.\"    On the day before the election, one party was full of boisterous,  bragging insolence; the other, still steadfast, firmly clinging  to what seemed a forlorn hope. Before the ending of another day  all was changed--a complete transformation scene had taken place.    When the morning journals on the election day appeared, their news  from the United States was such a terrible chapter of accidents as  has rarely fallen to the lot of journals to publish in one day. The  President had been shot at in New York by an unemployed foreign  artisan, the night before, while leaving a mansion on Fifth Avenue.  Troubles between labor and capital, which had been brewing for  some time, had broken out in several manufacturing centres, and  were threatening to spread to all large cities. The money market  was showing signs of considerable derangement. Fearful storms and  floods were chronicled from all parts; while last, but not least,  three transports which had embarked the greater part of the \"army,\"  at San Francisco, that was to have \"delivered\" British Columbia,  had foundered in a hurricane only two miles out, dragging all the  poor deluded fellows to a watery grave. The same day brought good  news from the old world. Ireland's great statesman had won for  Britain a wonderful diplomatic triumph in the East, which added  to the Empire, without a drop of blood being shed, territories  extending from the confines of British India to the Mediterranean.  All the leading men in Europe (so the despatch read) were  astonished at the exhibition of so much moral force in the Old  Country after they had been imagining the Empire as about to go to  pieces under the recent terrible strain. Other good news which had  its effect here was that for Ireland there had at last been found  men who understood her wants, and what was better, whom she herself  understood, so that she considered herself as having just embarked  upon a new career of glory as an integral and indispensable part  of the Empire.    The effect of all this information on the electors of Canada was  very marked. The demagogues who elevated themselves upon barrels or  waggons and buggies to spout their frothy nonsense to the public,  could get but few listeners, though only twenty-four hours ago  applauding crowds would have assembled. Their hold on the people was  gone; every one was reading the papers or discussing the startling  news. Many men who the day before were noisily advocating everything  disloyal and rebellious, were silent and thoughtful. Men who had  remained loyal to Canada all through quickly seized the occasion and  appealed to the people to stand firm to the Dominion, pointing out  the uncertainty of affairs in the States and contrasting them with  the vitality and power of the Old Country, doubly powerful now that  Ireland had obtained perfect satisfaction and was contented. The  election resulted in a complete triumph for the government, and was  a most satisfactory vindication of their policy. The ranks of the  Opposition were broken up and their forces demoralized. Not a word  was heard about annexation that night unless in scorn.    The heart of the young nation was stirred to its very depths during  the next two months, while a most sublime period in our history  was being passed through. The would-be invaders of Canada were  determined not to be baulked in their enterprise, the movement  having gone too far to collapse suddenly, and perhaps the leaders  had not sufficient foresight to see that the troubles rising in the  States must necessarily get worse before they were better, and take  several years to subside; perhaps they did not realize fully the  new unanimity of public feeling in Canada. Anyhow the activity of  their preparations did not lessen, but rather increased, and the  commencement of offensive operations was postponed so that they  might be more complete. Disloyalty was no longer popular in  Ontario or in any other province, in fact among all who had been  disaffected a reaction and revulsion of feeling set in, in favor  of intense loyalty to the Dominion, and a most felicitous union was  effected between the Conservatives and Reformers. The common danger  brought all parties together, forgetful of old prejudices, and the  old bitter hatred grew less and less until its final extinction.  Henceforth there was but one party with but one object in view--the  welfare of the Dominion.    Every able-bodied man in Canada between the ages of 20 and 45 was  under drill, and the country was fully prepared and fully expecting  to undertake the invaders without outside assistance, but Great  Britain being in no danger now in Europe, despatched 12,000 men to  Canada, and with her recovered prestige was enabled to remonstrate  forcibly with the Washington Government concerning American  connivance. The British remonstrances had the desired effect, for  the American authorities promptly arrested the leaders of the \"army  of deliverance,\" though by so doing they aroused the animosity of  many of their own supporters. The \"army\" then speedily fell away  and all"]]]
