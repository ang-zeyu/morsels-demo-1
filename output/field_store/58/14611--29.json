[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37363"],[0,"Making Up with Mr. Dog (#2)"],[1,"HE CAME]    There he was. His feet didn't quite touch the ground, and he couldn't  get up any higher either. Then all at once the people up stairs saw how  it was, and they commenced to laugh in spite of themselves, and hitched  the rope around a peg under the sill so they could rest a minute. That  was fun for them, but it wasn't for Mr. Dog, by a good deal. He couldn't  laugh, and he couldn't rest, either. And just then Mr. Squirrel came  with his trunk, and Mr. Robin with his satchel and a hand bag, and Mr.  Turtle with his things in a big sack. Mr. 'Coon ran down and let them  all in and locked the door. Then he ran back to the window where Mr. Dog  was.    \"If we'll let you down will you go home and not come around this hotel  interfering with our business?\" says Mr. 'Possum.    \"Yes; will you promise not to try to get any of our guests away from  us?\" says Mr. 'Coon.    [Illustration: HE CAUGHT IT AS HE WENT BY]    Mr. Dog couldn't talk much in the fix he was in, but he did the best he  could, and promised yes to everything, so pretty soon they let the trunk  down till his feet touched the ground and he could get his teeth out of  the strap. Then he put out for home just about as fast as he could go,  without so much as thanking them for letting him down, and up went Mr.  Rabbit's trunk pretty quick, now that there were plenty to help.    Then the guests all hurried to their rooms to unpack, and Mr. Crow  bustled around to get supper with what he had in the house, for Mr.  'Possum and Mr. 'Coon hadn't time yet to bring in anything. It was a  pretty good supper, though, and all the guests said so, and said they  knew what a good cook Mr. Crow was if he had things to work with, and  the Crow said he guessed he could do his part if the 'Coon and 'Possum  would do theirs.    Well, it makes a good deal of difference whether you're company at a  house or a boarder. They all felt a good deal like company at first, but  by the next evening at supper time they felt different. Mr. 'Coon and  Mr. 'Possum had been out all day bringing in things, too, and Mr. Crow  had been cooking harder than ever. Mr. Robin was first to make remarks.  He said the cherries were canned, and not very good at that.    [Illustration: THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHER GUESTS]    \"That's what I said,\" put in Mr. 'Coon, \"but Mr. 'Possum said you  wouldn't know the difference.\"    \"Oh, he did, did he?\" says Mr. Robin. \"Well, I've got better cherries  than these at home,\" and he got up from the table with a disgusted air.    Then Mr. Squirrel picked up some roasted nuts that the Crow had just  brought in.    \"Where'd you get these nuts?\" he says, after he'd cracked one or two of  them.    \"Down on the slope of Green Bushes,\" says Mr. 'Coon. \"Why, aren't they  good ones?\"    \"I suppose they were once,\" says Mr. Squirrel--\"two or three years ago.  Nuts have to be fresh to be good.\"    \"That's what I told him,\" says Mr. 'Possum, \"but he said you wouldn't  know the difference.\"    \"Oh, he did, did he?\" says Mr. Squirrel. \"Well, I've got better nuts  than these at home,\" and Mr. Squirrel _he_ got up and left the table.    Then Jack Rabbit began.    \"Where'd you get this salad?\" he says, turning up his nose.    \"Out by Mr. Man's back gate,\" says Mr. 'Possum. \"Why, isn't it good?\"    \"Might have been once,\" says Mr. Rabbit. \"I s'pose it's some Mr. Man  threw out because it was wilted.\"    \"That's what I told him,\" says Mr. 'Coon, \"but he said you wouldn't know  the difference.\"    \"Oh, he did, did he? Well, I've got better salad than this at home,\" and  Jack Rabbit _he_ got up and he left the table.    And then, pretty soon, Mr. Turtle made a face over the fish because they  were salt mackerel and not nice fresh fish, such as he was used to at  home. So he got up and left the table, too, and there sat the 'Coon and  'Possum and the Old Black Crow all by themselves and looking cheap  enough to fall through the floor. Mr. Crow said it wasn't his fault, and  then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum commenced to blame it on each other, and  nearly got into a fight. They were just about to fight when Mr. Crow  happened to think of something. Mr. Crow always did think of things.    \"I'll tell you!\" he says. \"We'll just rent rooms.\"    \"Do what?\" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon together.    \"Why, just rent each of our guests his room and let him take his meals  out. Then we won't have any work.\"    \"Whoop-ee!\" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon both together, as loud as  ever they could. That made all the guests come running back, and when  they heard the new plan they all said it was just the thing.    So then Mr. 'Possum went down and got the sign and brought it up and  changed it to read:--            THE HOLLOW TREE INN.          FURNISHED ROOMS ONLY.    And that was how business began at last in the Hollow Tree.          A DEEP WOODS FISHING PARTY    AN ADVENTURE WITH MR. DOG AND A VERY LARGE FISH      ONE warm, still June morning (this, of course, was before the Hollow  Tree Inn started) Mr. Jack Rabbit looked out of the window while he was  dressing and thought to himself that it would be just the very morning  for fish to bite.    Jack Rabbit liked to fish better than anything, almost, so right after  breakfast he took an empty tomato can and went out in the back yard and  turned over boards till he had the can about half full of bait, with a  little dirt thrown on top. Then he reached up under the eaves of the  smoke-house and pulled out a long cane pole with a line and hook and  floater on it, all rigged up ready, and flung it over his shoulder and  started.    Mr. Rabbit walked pretty fast--even lazy folks do that when they go  fishing, and Mr. Jack Rabbit wasn't lazy, by a good deal. So pretty soon  he came to the Hollow Tree, and there, looking out of an up-stairs  window, he saw the 'Coon, the 'Possum, and the Old Black Crow.    \"Hello, up there!\" he said. \"Don't you fellows want to go fishing?\"    Mr. 'Possum said he thought fish would bite well on such a morning, and  that he'd like to go first rate. Mr. 'Coon said he knew a place where  you could pull them out as fast as you could throw in your hook, and he  went on and told how he caught a fish there last year that would weigh  more than four pounds, and lost him just as he got him to the top of the  water. Mr. Crow said he'd always noticed that Mr. 'Coon's four-pound  fish never got any nearer to him than the top of the water, and that for  his part he didn't care much about fishing. He said, though, that if  the 'Coon and the 'Possum wanted to go he'd stay at home and get dinner  while they were gone, so's to have it ready when they all came home  hungry. He told them that he had some nice canned salmon in the cupboard  that he could catch 'most any time, and that if they really wanted fish  for dinner he s'posed he might as well open it. Then they all laughed,  and in about a minute down came Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum with their  fishing things. Jack Rabbit said he had plenty of bait, so away they  went. Mr. Crow sat up in the window and watched them off, and Mr. Robin,  who happened along just then, laughed and called after them that he'd  take a few pounds of nice bass when they got home. The Robin just said  that to plague them, of course, and Mr. 'Coon called back that they'd  fool him this time, and then he went on to remark that he'd never in his  life seen a finer day for fishing.    Jack Rabbit said yes, that it was fine, and that it was a fine day for  Mr. Dog to be out gallivanting over the country, too, and that they'd  better hurry up and get to the lake and out in his boat before anything  happened. That made Mr. 'Possum take a good deal livelier step, though  he commenced to whistle and said he wasn't afraid of Mr. Dog, anyway.  Mr. 'Coon said he'd always noticed that a fellow mostly whistled when he  wasn't afraid, but for his part he couldn't get to that boat any too  soon. And pretty soon they did get to it, and Mr. 'Possum was the first  one to pile in, though Mr. Dog wasn't anywhere in sight.    [Illustration: WHEN THEY GOT OUT TO WHERE MR. 'COON SAID THE GOOD PLACE  WAS, THEY ALL WENT TO FISHING]    Well, they pushed off, and Jack Rabbit took one oar and Mr. 'Coon the  other, while the 'Possum sat on the back seat and baited his hook so's  to catch the first fish. Then, when they got out to where Mr. 'Coon said  the good place was, they all went to fishing, and Mr. 'Possum did get  the first bite, but he didn't get anything else when he pulled. Mr.  'Coon told him he pulled too quick, and Jack Rabbit told him he didn't  pull quick enough, and asked him if he expected the fish to climb out on  his pole. Then Mr. Rabbit had a bite himself, and pulled and didn't get  anything, either. Of course, that made Mr. 'Possum laugh, and then, all  at once, the 'Coon had a great big bite that took his float away down  out of sight the first grab.    Mr. 'Coon let him go for a minute and then gave a hard pull and  commenced to call out that he had him this time and that he'd show Mr.  Crow now about only getting fish to the top of the water and having  canned salmon for dinner. Then he stood up in the boat and pulled as  hard as ever he could till all of a sudden his line broke, and down he  went backward, right on top of Mr. 'Possum, while the Rabbit swung his  hook over where the 'Coon's hook had been and the big fish grabbed it  before you could say Jack Robinson.    That was too bad for the 'Coon and the 'Possum, of course, and it wasn't  as much fun for Jack Rabbit as you might suppose, for he couldn't get  the big fish out to save his life, and he had to hold on to the boat to  keep from being pulled into the lake. Then he called to the others to  help him, and they both got up and took hold of the pole and hauled it  in hand over hand till they got to the line, and that was as far as they  could get. So Mr. Rabbit gave the line a twist or two around the iron  ring in the front of his boat,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37472"],[0,"Zanzibar Tales: Told (#2)"],[1,"nkey?\"    \"What peculiarity is there about a washerman's donkey?\"    \"It is a creature that has neither heart nor ears.\"    The shark, his curiosity overcoming his haste, thereupon begged to  be told the story of the washerman's donkey, which the monkey related  as follows:    \"A washerman owned a donkey, of which he was very fond. One day,  however, it ran away, and took up its abode in the forest, where it  led a lazy life, and consequently grew very fat.    \"At length Soongoo'ra, the hare, by chance passed that way, and saw  Poon'da, the donkey.    \"Now, the hare is the most cunning of all beasts--if you look at  his mouth you will see that he is always talking to himself about  everything.    \"So when Soongoora saw Poonda he said to himself, 'My, this donkey  is fat!' Then he went and told Sim'ba, the lion.    \"As Simba was just recovering from a severe illness, he was still so  weak that he could not go hunting. He was consequently pretty hungry.    \"Said Mr. Soongoora, 'I'll bring enough meat to-morrow for both of  us to have a great feast, but you'll have to do the killing.'    \"'All right, good friend,' exclaimed Simba, joyfully; 'you're very  kind.'    \"So the hare scampered off to the forest, found the donkey, and said  to her, in his most courtly manner, 'Miss Poonda, I am sent to ask  your hand in marriage.'    \"'By whom?' simpered the donkey.    \"'By Simba, the lion.'    \"The donkey was greatly elated at this, and exclaimed: 'Let's go at  once. This is a first-class offer.'    \"They soon arrived at the lion's home, were cordially invited in,  and sat down. Soongoora gave Simba a signal with his eyebrow, to  the effect that this was the promised feast, and that he would wait  outside. Then he said to Poonda: 'I must leave you for a while to  attend to some private business. You stay here and converse with your  husband that is to be.'    \"As soon as Soongoora got outside, the lion sprang at Poonda, and  they had a great fight. Simba was kicked very hard, and he struck  with his claws as well as his weak health would permit him. At last  the donkey threw the lion down, and ran away to her home in the forest.    \"Shortly after, the hare came back, and called, 'Haya! Simba! have  you got it?'    \"'I have not got it,' growled the lion; 'she kicked me and ran away;  but I warrant you I made her feel pretty sore, though I'm not strong.'    \"'Oh, well,' remarked Soongoora; 'don't put yourself out of the way  about it.'    \"Then Soongoora waited many days, until the lion and the donkey  were both well and strong, when he said: 'What do you think now,  Simba? Shall I bring you your meat?'    \"'Ay,' growled the lion, fiercely; 'bring it to me. I'll tear it in  two pieces!'    \"So the hare went off to the forest, where the donkey welcomed him  and asked the news.    \"'You are invited to call again and see your lover,' said Soongoora.    \"'Oh, dear!' cried Poonda; 'that day you took me to him he scratched  me awfully. I'm afraid to go near him now.'    \"'Ah, pshaw!' said Soongoora; 'that's nothing. That's only Simba's  way of caressing.'    \"'Oh, well,' said the donkey, 'let's go.'    \"So off they started again; but as soon as the lion caught sight of  Poonda he sprang upon her and tore her in two pieces.    \"When the hare came up, Simba said to him: 'Take this meat and roast  it. As for myself, all I want is the heart and ears.'    \"'Thanks,' said Soongoora. Then he went away and roasted the meat in  a place where the lion could not see him, and he took the heart and  ears and hid them. Then he ate all the meat he needed, and put the  rest away.    \"Presently the lion came to him and said, 'Bring me the heart and  ears.'    \"'Where are they?' said the hare.    \"'What does this mean?' growled Simba.    \"'Why, didn't you know this was a washerman's donkey?'    \"'Well, what's that to do with there being no heart or ears?'    \"'For goodness' sake, Simba, aren't you old enough to know that if  this beast had possessed a heart and ears it wouldn't have come back  the second time?'    \"Of course the lion had to admit that what Soongoora, the hare,  said was true.    \"And now,\" said Keema to the shark, \"you want to make a washerman's  donkey of me. Get out of there, and go home by yourself. You are not  going to get me again, and our friendship is ended. Good-bye, Papa.\"                II.    THE HARE AND THE LION.      One day Soongoo'ra, the hare, roaming through the forest in search  of food, glanced up through the boughs of a very large calabash tree,  and saw that a great hole in the upper part of the trunk was inhabited  by bees; thereupon he returned to town in search of some one to go  with him and help to get the honey.    As he was passing the house of Boo'koo, the big rat, that worthy  gentleman invited him in. So he went in, sat down, and remarked:  \"My father has died, and has left me a hive of honey. I would like  you to come and help me to eat it.\"    Of course Bookoo jumped at the offer, and he and the hare started  off immediately.    When they arrived at the great calabash tree, Soongoora pointed out  the bees' nest and said, \"Go on; climb up.\" So, taking some straw with  them, they climbed up to the nest, lit the straw, smoked out the bees,  put out the fire, and set to work eating the honey.    In the midst of the feast, who should appear at the foot of the tree  but Sim'ba, the lion? Looking up, and seeing them eating, he asked,  \"Who are you?\"    Then Soongoora whispered to Bookoo, \"Hold your tongue; that old  fellow is crazy.\" But in a very little while Simba roared out angrily:  \"Who are you, I say? Speak, I tell you!\" This made Bookoo so scared  that he blurted out, \"It's only us!\"    Upon this the hare said to him: \"You just wrap me up in this straw,  call to the lion to keep out of the way, and then throw me down. Then  you'll see what will happen.\"    So Bookoo, the big rat, wrapped Soongoora, the hare, in the straw,  and then called to Simba, the lion, \"Stand back; I'm going to throw  this straw down, and then I'll come down myself.\" When Simba stepped  back out of the way, Bookoo threw down the straw, and as it lay on the  ground Soongoora crept out and ran away while the lion was looking up.    After waiting a minute or two, Simba roared out, \"Well, come down,  I say!\" and, there being no help for it, the big rat came down.    As soon as he was within reach, the lion caught hold of him, and asked,  \"Who was up there with you?\"    \"Why,\" said Bookoo, \"Soongoora, the hare. Didn't you see him when I  threw him down?\"    \"Of course I didn't see him,\" replied the lion, in an incredulous  tone, and, without wasting further time, he ate the big rat, and then  searched around for the hare, but could not find him.    Three days later, Soongoora called on his acquaintance, Ko'bay,  the tortoise, and said to him, \"Let us go and eat some honey.\"    \"Whose honey?\" inquired Kobay, cautiously.    \"My father's,\" Soongoora replied.    \"Oh, all right; I'm with you,\" said the tortoise, eagerly; and away  they went.    When they arrived at the great calabash tree they climbed up with  their straw, smoked out the bees, sat down, and began to eat.    Just then Mr. Simba, who owned the honey, came out again, and,  looking up, inquired, \"Who are you, up there?\"    Soongoora whispered to Kobay, \"Keep quiet;\" but when the lion repeated  his question angrily, Kobay became suspicious, and said: \"I will  speak. You told me this honey was yours; am I right in suspecting  that it belongs to Simba?\"    So, when the lion asked again, \"Who are you?\" he answered, \"It's only  us.\" The lion said, \"Come down, then;\" and the tortoise answered,  \"We're coming.\"    Now, Simba had been keeping an eye open for Soongoora since the day  he caught Bookoo, the big rat, and, suspecting that he was up there  with Kobay, he said to himself, \"I've got him this time, sure.\"    Seeing that they were caught again, Soongoora said to the tortoise:  \"Wrap me up in the straw, tell Simba to stand out of the way, and then  throw me down. I'll wait for you below. He can't hurt you, you know.\"    \"All right,\" said Kobay; but while he was wrapping the hare up he  said to himself: \"This fellow wants to run away, and leave me to  bear the lion's anger. He shall get caught first.\" Therefore, when he  had bundled him up, he called out, \"Soongoora is coming!\" and threw  him down.    So Simba caught the hare, and, holding him with his paw, said, \"Now,  what shall I do with you?\" The hare replied, \"It's of no use for you  to try to eat me; I'm awfully tough.\" \"What would be the best thing  to do with you, then?\" asked Simba.    \"I think,\" said Soongoora, \"you should take me by the tail, whirl  me around, and knock me against the ground. Then you may be able to  eat me.\"    So the lion, being deceived, took him by the tail and whirled him  around, but just as he was going to knock him on the ground he slipped  out of his grasp and ran away, and Simba had the mortification of  losing him again.    Angry and disappointed, he turned to the tree and called to Kobay,  \"You come down, too.\"    When the tortoise reached the ground, the lion said, \"You're pretty  hard; what can I do to make you eatable?\"    \"Oh, that's easy,\" laughed Kobay; \"just put me in the mud and rub my  back with your paw until my shell comes off.\"    Immediately on hearing this, Simba carried Kobay to the water, placed  him in the mud, and began, as he supposed, to rub his back; but the  tortoise had slipped away, and the lion continued rubbing on a piece  of rock until his paws were raw. When he glanced down at them he saw  they were bleeding, and, realizing that he had again been outwitted,  he said, \"Well, the hare has done me to-day, but I'll go hunting now  until I find him.\"    So Simba, the lion, set out immediately in search of Soongoora,  the hare, and as he went along he inquired of every one he met,  \"Where is the house of Soongoora?\" But each person he asked answered,  \"I do"]]]
