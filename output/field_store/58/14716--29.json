We may repulse Oudinot's attack; but  France could send any amount of reinforcements to him, while we have no  friends to go to. It is well that your wife, Muriel, and the boy were  sent off a month since to Leghorn, where, if we escape from what must  happen here, we can join them and take ship for England.\"    \"I am sorry that you should be involved in this affair, Leonard.\"    \"I am not sorry,\" the other said. \"In the first place, after being here  more than ten years, I have come to hate the tyranny and oppression, I  don't say of the Pope himself, but of his underlings, as much as you do.  In the second place, I would fight by the side of Garibaldi in almost  any quarrel. I do not agree with him in his love for republics, but he  has infected me with his hatred of tyrants and his burning patriotism.  He is a glorious man; and after having been his comrade, I may almost  say his brother, in adventures, hardships, and battles for two years, it  would be strange indeed if I hesitated to join him in his crusade to rid  Italy of her tyrants. I am a soldier, and I own to a fondness for  fighting when convinced that the cause is a just one. I know your  opinions on the subject; but I suppose you do not propose to fight  yourself?\"    \"I do indeed, Leonard. I do not say that I should be a match for a  strong and active man in a bout with swords, though of course I learned  the use of the rapier when a student, but at fifty I can at least use a  musket as well as a younger man, and if Rome fights I fight with her.  Ah, here comes Garibaldi!\"    The door opened, and a man entered, whose appearance, even had he not  been dressed in a red shirt, blue trousers of rough cloth, and a soft,  broad-brimmed wide-awake, would have been remarked wherever he went. Of  middle height, he was exceptionally wide across the shoulders and deep  in the chest; he wore his hair and beard long--both were of a golden  yellow, giving a remarkably leonine look to his face; his eyes were  blue, and the general expression of his face, when not angered, was  pleasant and good-tempered, although marked also by resolution and  firmness. At that time his name was comparatively little known in  Europe, although the extraordinary bravery and enterprise that he had  shown at Rio and Monte Video had marked him as a leader of guerilla  warfare, possessing many characteristics that recalled the exploits of  Lord Cochrane. It was only when, after his services had been declined by  Carlo Alberto, King of Sardinia, he was, with a few hundred followers,  making his way to aid in the defence of Venice against the Austrians,  that, on hearing that Rome had risen, he hurried to aid the movement,  and on his arrival there was greeted with enthusiasm by the populace,  who had been informed by Mazzini of his exploits.    \"You have heard the news?\" he said as he entered.    \"Yes; we were just talking it over,\" Leonard Percival said, \"and  conclude, as I suppose you do, that the French come as enemies.\"    \"There can be no doubt about it, my friend,\" Garibaldi said. \"If they  had said that they came as enemies I might have doubted them; but after  the evasive answer their general gave to the deputation Mazzini sent  them this morning, I have no question whatever that they will attack us  to-morrow.\"    \"And you will fight?\"    \"Of course. We shall beat them, I think; in the end Rome must fall, but  our resistance will not have been in vain. The stand we shall make  against tyranny will touch every heart throughout Italy. It will show  that, ground down as the people have been for centuries, the old fire of  the Romans is not extinct. This will be but the beginning. When it is  seen that the despots cannot maintain their authority save by the aid of  foreign powers, there will be revolt after revolt until Italy is free.  There were some grand lines you once told me as we sat round a camp  fire, Percival, that exactly express my thoughts.\"    \"I know what you mean,\" the Englishman said. \"They were Byron's:        For freedom's battle once begun,      Bequeath'd by bleeding sire to son,      Though baffled oft, is ever won.\"    \"They are splendid and true,\" Garibaldi said enthusiastically. \"So shall  it be with us. This is our first battle--we cannot hope to win it; but  our guns will tell Italy and Europe that we have awoke at last, that,  after being slaves so long that we had come to be looked upon as a  people content to be ruled by despots, we are still men, and that,  having once begun the fight for freedom, we will maintain it until  freedom is won.\"    \"And now, what are your plans for to-morrow?\"    \"As soon as the French are seen approaching the city the church bells  will ring and the alarm be beaten in the streets. The word has been  passed round that all are to assemble instantly. The troops that have  been organised will first pour out; the rest will follow with such arms  as they have. We shall simply rush upon the French. In such a fight  there is no need for manoeuvring; and it is well that it is so, for  there the French would be our superiors. We shall simply attack and  drive them back. We may take it for granted that, being boastful  creatures and believing that they have but to show themselves and we  shall lay down our arms and implore their mercy, they will be wholly  taken by surprise and disconcerted by our onslaught. Can you recommend  anything better, my friend?\"    \"No. With such a force as yours, newly raised and wholly unused to  discipline, it is probable that at the first engagement, and with the  advantage of surprise, they will, as you say, drive back the French; but  you will have to adopt different tactics afterwards: to stand on the  defensive and prevent their entering the city as long as possible, and  to defend every street and lane, as the Spaniards did at Saragossa. They  may take the city at last, but at so terrible a cost of blood that we  may be sure that when you rise again the French people will not allow  another expedition to be undertaken for a cause in which they have no  concern, and which would entail such heavy sacrifices.\"    \"Will you have a separate command, Percival? You have but to choose one,  and it is yours.\"    \"I will fight by your side,\" the Englishman said briefly. \"I know that I  shall get my full share of the work then.\"    \"And you, professor?\"    \"I shall go out with the rest. The students have elected me their  captain, and I shall, of course, lead them. It is a simple matter. I see  the enemy in front, and I go at them. Even I, a man of peace all my  life, understand that. I shall have with me at least a dozen of my  colleagues, and if I am shot they can direct our boys as well as I can.\"    \"Good!\" Garibaldi said. \"If I thought that you could keep the students  in hand, and then dash into the thick of it if you see our men wavering  anywhere, I should say do so; but I know that it would be impossible.  They will long to be in the front rank and to set an example to others,  and I shall feel confident that, wherever they may be, there will be no  faltering. Your chief difficulty will be in restraining their ardour.  Well, my friends, I have many things to arrange, so must be going. You  will find me in my quarters at nine o'clock this evening, Percival. The  officers and the heads of the various quarters of the town are to meet  me there at that hour, to arrange where the assembling-places are to be  when the alarm is given, and the streets through which they must move  when we see at which point the French are going to attack us.\"    \"I will come down with him,\" the professor said. \"I will send word to my  colleagues where to meet me an hour later, so that I can inform them of  the arrangements.\"    And with a nod Garibaldi, who had been unanimously elected general of  the Roman forces, strolled away.    Leonard Percival had been a captain in the British army, but having  become tired of garrison life during the long peace, had sold out in  1837, and sailed for South America, where there were always  opportunities for a man of action to distinguish himself. He took part  in the struggle of Rio Grande for separation from Brazil. Here he first  made the acquaintance of Garibaldi, and shared with him in the many  perilous adventures and desperate fights of that war. Becoming disgusted  with the factions and intrigues that were rampant at Rio, he left the  service of the little republic and returned to England.    He was the second son of a wealthy English gentleman, who had viewed  with much disapproval his leaving the army and undertaking the life of a  soldier of fortune when there was no occasion for his doing so, as he  had an allowance amply sufficient for him to live upon. His father was  not much surprised when, after staying for a month at home, Leonard told  him that, having a taste for art, he had made up his mind to adopt it as  a profession, and should go out to Rome to study. This seemed to him  better than wandering about the world fighting in quarrels in which he  had no concern, and he had no valid reply to his son when the latter  said,--    \"You see, father, you cannot expect me to spend my life in absolute  laziness. I must be doing something. The life of a club lounger is the  last I should choose. I have no liking for a country life--if I had I  would go out to Australia or Canada and settle; but I know that in a few  months I should be home again, for I could not stand a life of solitude.  If you can suggest anything better I shall be ready, as far as possible,  to be guided by your wishes.\"    \"You may as well have your own way, Leonard. I suppose it will come to  that in the end, and therefore you may as well do it first as last; and  at any rate, a few months in Rome will be a change for you, and I shall  not be expecting by every post a communication saying that you have been  killed.\"    So Captain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#2)"],[1,"their possessions, now insignificant and torn from us by war, by  treachery, by the loss of time, by ancestral extravagance, by adhesion  to the old faith and monarch, were formerly prodigious, and embraced  many counties, at a time when Ireland was vastly more prosperous than  now. I would assume the Irish crown over my coat-of-arms, but that there  are so many silly pretenders to that distinction who bear it and render  it common.    Who knows, but for the fault of a woman, I might have been wearing  it now? You start with incredulity. I say, why not? Had there been a  gallant chief to lead my countrymen, instead or puling knaves who bent  the knee to King Richard II., they might have been freemen; had there  been a resolute leader to meet the murderous ruffian Oliver Cromwell, we  should have shaken off the English for ever. But there was no Barry in  the field against the usurper; on the contrary, my ancestor, Simon de  Bary, came over with the first-named monarch, and married the daughter  of the then King of Munster, whose sons in battle he pitilessly slew.    In Oliver's time it was too late for a chief of the name of Barry  to lift up his war-cry against that of the murderous brewer. We were  princes of the land no longer; our unhappy race had lost its possessions  a century previously, and by the most shameful treason. This I know to  be the fact, for my mother has often told me the story, and besides had  worked it in a worsted pedigree which hung up in the yellow saloon at  Barryville where we lived.    That very estate which the Lyndons now possess in Ireland was once the  property of my race. Rory Barry of Barryogue owned it in Elizabeth's  time, and half Munster beside. The Barry was always in feud with the  O'Mahonys in those times; and, as it happened, a certain English colonel  passed through the former's country with a body of men-at-arms, on the  very day when the O'Mahonys had made an inroad upon our territories, and  carried off a frightful plunder of our flocks and herds.    This young Englishman, whose name was Roger Lyndon, Linden, or Lyndaine,  having been most hospitably received by the Barry, and finding him just  on the point of carrying an inroad into the O'Mahonys' land, offered  the aid of himself and his lances, and behaved himself so well, as it  appeared, that the O'Mahonys were entirely overcome, all the Barrys'  property restored, and with it, says the old chronicle, twice as much of  the O'Mahonys' goods and cattle.    It was the setting in of the winter season, and the young soldier was  pressed by the Barry not to quit his house of Barryogue, and remained  there during several months, his men being quartered with Barry's own  gallowglasses, man by man in the cottages round about. They conducted  themselves, as is their wont, with the most intolerable insolence  towards the Irish; so much so, that fights and murders continually  ensued, and the people vowed to destroy them.    The Barry's son (from whom I descend) was as hostile to the English as  any other man on his domain; and, as they would not go when bidden, he  and his friends consulted together and determined on destroying these  English to a man.    But they had let a woman into their plot, and this was the Barry's  daughter. She was in love with the English Lyndon, and broke the whole  secret to him; and the dastardly English prevented the just massacre of  themselves by falling on the Irish, and destroying Phaudrig Barry, my  ancestor, and many hundreds of his men. The cross at Barrycross near  Carrignadihioul is the spot where the odious butchery took place.    Lyndon married the daughter of Roderick Barry, and claimed the estate  which he left: and though the descendants of Phaudrig were alive, as  indeed they are in my person,[Footnote: As we have never been able to  find proofs of the marriage of my ancestor Phaudrig with his wife,  I make no doubt that Lyndon destroyed the contract, and murdered the  priest and witnesses of the marriage.--B. L.] on appealing to the  English courts, the estate was awarded to the Englishman, as has ever  been the case where English and Irish were concerned.    Thus, had it not been for the weakness of a woman, I should have been  born to the possession of those very estates which afterwards came to me  by merit, as you shall hear. But to proceed with my family, history.    My father was well known to the best circles in this kingdom, as in that  of Ireland, under the name of Roaring Harry Barry. He was bred like many  other young sons of genteel families to the profession of the law, being  articled to a celebrated attorney of Sackville Street in the city of  Dublin; and, from his great genius and aptitude for learning, there is  no doubt he would have made an eminent figure in his profession, had not  his social qualities, love of field-sports, and extraordinary graces  of manner, marked him out for a higher sphere. While he was attorney's  clerk he kept seven race-horses, and hunted regularly both with the  Kildare and Wicklow hunts; and rode on his grey horse Endymion that  famous match against Captain Punter, which is still remembered by lovers  of the sport, and of which I caused a splendid picture to be made and  hung over my dining-hall mantelpiece at Castle Lyndon. A year afterwards  he had the honour of riding that very horse Endymion before his late  Majesty King George II. at New-market, and won the plate there and the  attention of the august sovereign.    Although he was only the second son of our family, my dear father came  naturally into the estate (now miserably reduced to L400 a year); for my  grandfather's eldest son Cornelius Barry (called the Chevalier Borgne,  from a wound which he received in Germany) remained constant to the old  religion in which our family was educated, and not only served abroad  with credit, but against His Most Sacred Majesty George II. in the  unhappy Scotch disturbances in '45. We shall hear more of the Chevalier  hereafter.    For the conversion of my father I have to thank my dear mother, Miss  Bell Brady, daughter of Ulysses Brady of Castle Brady, county Kerry,  Esquire and J.P. She was the most beautiful woman of her day in Dublin,  and universally called the Dasher there. Seeing her at the assembly,  my father became passionately attached to her; but her soul was above  marrying a Papist or an attorney's clerk; and so, for the love of her,  the good old laws being then in force, my dear father slipped into my  uncle Cornelius's shoes and took the family estate. Besides the force of  my mother's bright eyes, several persons, and of the genteelest society  too, contributed to this happy change; and I have often heard my mother  laughingly tell the story of my father's recantation, which was solemnly  pronounced at the tavern in the company of Sir Dick Ringwood, Lord  Bagwig, Captain Punter, and two or three other young sparks of the  town. Roaring Harry won 300 pieces that very night at faro, and laid  the necessary information the next morning against his brother; but his  conversion caused a coolness between him and my uncle Corney, who joined  the rebels in consequence.    This great difficulty being settled, my Lord Bagwig lent my father his  own yacht, then lying at the Pigeon House, and the handsome Bell Brady  was induced to run away with him to England, although her parents  were against the match, and her lovers (as I have heard her tell many  thousands of times) were among the most numerous and the most wealthy  in all the kingdom of Ireland. They were married at the Savoy, and my  grandfather dying very soon, Harry Barry, Esquire, took possession of  his paternal property and supported our illustrious name with credit in  London. He pinked the famous Count Tiercelin behind Montague House, he  was a member of 'White's,' and a frequenter of all the chocolate-houses;  and my mother, likewise, made no small figure. At length, after his  great day of triumph before His Sacred Majesty at Newmarket, Harry's  fortune was just on the point of being made, for the gracious monarch  promised to provide for him. But alas! he was taken in charge by another  monarch, whose will have no delay or denial,--by Death, namely, who  seized upon my father at Chester races, leaving me a helpless orphan.  Peace be to his ashes! He was not faultless, and dissipated all our  princely family property; but he was as brave a fellow as ever tossed  a bumper or called a main, and he drove his coach-and-six like a man of  fashion.    I do not know whether His gracious Majesty was much affected by this  sudden demise of my father, though my mother says he shed some royal  tears on the occasion. But they helped us to nothing: and all that was  found in the house for the wife and creditors was a purse of ninety  guineas, which my dear mother naturally took, with the family plate, and  my father's wardrobe and her own; and putting them into our great coach,  drove off to Holyhead, whence she took shipping for Ireland. My father's  body accompanied us in the finest hearse and plumes money could buy; for  though the husband and wife had quarrelled repeatedly in life, yet at my  father's death his high-spirited widow forgot all her differences, gave  him the grandest funeral that had been seen for many a day, and erected  a monument over his remains (for which I subsequently paid), which  declared him to be the wisest, purest, and most affectionate of men.    In performing these sad duties over her deceased lord, the widow spent  almost every guinea she had, and, indeed, would have spent a great deal  more, had she discharged one-third of the demands which the ceremonies  occasioned. But the people around our old house of Barryogue, although  they did not like my father for his change of faith, yet stood by him at  this moment, and were for exterminating the mutes sent by Mr. Plumer of  London with the lamented remains.
