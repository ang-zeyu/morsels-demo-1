A haze of Tyrian hue purpled the hills that  encircled the little town, and mellowed the glory of the sunshine. There  were splashes of green in the meadows so delicate as to be almost  yellow, and along the brooks the willows played their fast greening  boughs against a background of gray wood color. The very earth was  odorous and the air was like balm, but Beatrice, usually susceptible to  the beauties of Nature, was in too abstracted a mood to be conscious of  the loveliness about her.    \"But of course he would know me,\" she told herself at length,  reassuringly. \"Why, I should know him, and I was only five years old  when he went away.\"    And with this she laughed aloud that she should have been so foolish as  to consider for even a moment the absurd possibility of her father's not  knowing her, and with her customary brightness of spirit restored she  quickened her steps, and soon reached her uncle's place.    There were many acres in the estate. Henry Raymond was a well to do  lawyer, and the walk to the dwelling lay through a large orchard. As Bee  came in sight of the house the door opened, and a girl, about her own  age, came out on the piazza, and ran down the steps to meet her. She was  an extremely pretty girl. A slim graceful figure was hers, with a proud  little head and sunny, shining hair that hung about her face with its  beautiful blue eyes like a halo. She seemed rather the personification  of loveliness than a flesh and blood maiden.    \"What made you so late, Bee?\" she cried. \"I have been watching for you  fully an hour.\"    \"I staid to help Professor Lawrence for one thing; then the girls  stopped me to talk with them. They want us to go to Edna's tomorrow  afternoon. Will you be well enough to go, Adele?\"    \"Oh, I'm all right now, Bee. Papa came home early with a box of  chocolates, and that seemed to be just what I needed.\"    Bee laughed.    \"You butterfly,\" she said. \"Always feeding on sweets. Did you leave me  any?\"    \"Well--\" Adele Raymond hesitated. \"Not many, and that's a fact, Bee. You  shouldn't have kept me waiting so long. And you haven't even noticed  that I have on a new hat.\"    \"But I thought that yours had violets on it,\" remarked Bee as she  glanced at the hat. \"That has red roses.\"    \"Well, this one is yours, goosey. You're a funny girl, Bee, not to know  your own hat. I have been trying mine on, then I thought I'd wear yours  to meet you. And oh, Bee! the pictures have come too.\"    \"What? Our photographs?\" exclaimed Bee eagerly.    \"Why Aunt Annie thought that we wouldn't have them for a week yet.  Where are they, Adele?\"    \"In the library. I never knew you to be so concerned about your picture  before, Bee.\"    \"I am going to send one to father,\" observed Bee as she hurried into the  house. \"It's come just in time to go out with the letter.\"    \"But do come up stairs first, Bee, and see my new hat. Wouldn't you like  to see it?\"    \"I'd rather see the pictures,\" answered Bee making a dash for the  library, flinging her hat in one direction and her books in another as  she did so.    \"Mamma won't like it if she sees your things lying about,\" observed her  cousin following her into the library.    \"I'll pick them up just as soon as I see the photographs,\" said Bee  impatiently as she took up the pictures.    \"Oh, Adele! how pretty you do look in yours; but mine--Oh, dear! it  certainly leaves much to be desired.\"    \"Mamma said that your good looks lay in your expression,\" remarked her  cousin. \"That is what makes it so hard to get a good picture of you,  Bee. You are not going to send it to Uncle William, are you?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Bee with determination. \"I never would send one before  because I always hoped to get a good one, but tonight Sue Ford asked me  if I thought he would know me if he were to meet me unexpectedly, and I  am going to make sure of it. Now, if you don't mind, Adele, I'll begin  my letter at once.\"    \"Oh, Bee. I have been so lonely and dull,\" pleaded Adele. \"Must you  write it this very minute?\"    \"If I don't he won't hear from me at all this month, and father insists  on hearing once a month. It is such a little thing to do for him, and I  love to please him. It won't take me long.\"    \"Of course then I must go away, and leave you alone,\" said her cousin  petulantly. \"Mamma doesn't want me to bother you when you are writing to  him; but please don't be long, Bee.\"    \"I won't,\" promised Bee, and at last she was left in peace.    An hour later Adele opened the door the merest trifle to peep in: \"Mamma  wants you to come to her just as soon as you have finished Bee,\" she  said. \"Are you through?\"    \"I have written the letter, but I haven't fixed the envelope for the  picture yet,\" answered Beatrice jumping up from the desk. \"If you don't  mind doing it for me, Adele, I'll see what Aunt Annie wants.\"    \"I don't mind a bit, Bee.\" Adele came into the room quickly. \"Where is  the address?\"    \"Here!\" Bee moved a slip of paper on the desk toward her. \"He is to be  in Egypt this month.\"    \"Just think of it,\" commented Adele bending over the desk. \"That's a  long way off. Shall I put the picture in for you, Bee?\"    But Bee had already left the room. Adele directed the envelope in her  best hand, then picked up her cousin's photograph, and looked at it  critically.    \"Poor Bee!\" she said aloud. \"It isn't very good of her. I'd hate to have  my father think I looked like that if he was far away from me. And Bee  is much better looking. I suppose Uncle William won't mind though, as  she is his daughter. Now if it were my picture--\"    She placed her own picture beside that of Bee's, and gazed at it  complacently. Suddenly she gave a little ripple of laughter:    \"Wouldn't it be fun to send my picture instead of Bee's?\" she exclaimed,  her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"I believe I'll do it. Bee will never  know, and hers is really not good enough to send.\"    With this she slipped Bee's photograph into a drawer of the desk, placed  her own in the envelope, and sealed it just as Bee re-entered the room.    \"You're a dear!\" exclaimed Bee taking it from her, and picking up her  letter. \"Aunt Annie wants me to go down town for her, and I'll be just  in time for the night mail.\"          Chapter II    The Omen of the Butterfly        \"Light and silv'ry cloudlets hover        In the air as yet scarce warm;      Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,        Peeps the sun through fragrant balm.\"        _May Song. Goethe._      \"I am so glad that I sent it,\" exclaimed Beatrice again and again after  posting the letter and the photograph. \"Father has always wanted my  picture, but I waited hoping that sometime I'd get a good one. Still, it  will give him an idea of how I look even though it is a poor likeness. I  do wonder if he will like it!\"    And with a roguish smile Adele would answer: \"I think so, Bee.\"    The days passed. With more than her usual impatience Bee waited for an  answer to her letter. If the connections were prompt, if he were not  away from civilization on an extended butterfly hunt, if he wrote just  as soon as he received it, she ought to hear by the last of May, she  told herself; so, having arrived at this conclusion, she tried to rest  in patience until that time should come.    At length the timid beauties of April were merged into the exuberance of  the leaf and flower of May, and Nature was resplendent in the full glory  of the springtide. The last day of the month fell upon a Saturday, and  early in the morning of that day Bee dressed herself to go into town for  the mail. Seating herself upon the steps of the piazza to wait for Adele  who was to accompany her she feasted her eyes upon the beauty of the  orchard whose trees seemed like great pink and white bouquets set in the  ground. Suddenly a puff of wind stirred the branches, and sent the  petals of the apple blossoms flying in every direction.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the girl springing up from the steps in pretended  dismay as a shower of the fragrant blooms deluged her. \"Snow in May! I  told Adele that it would be Christmas before she was ready. Come out,  and see the storm, Aunt Annie.\"    A lady standing just inside a long French window which opened upon the  porch came through it to her niece's side.    \"What an idea!\" she said in a clear musical voice.    \"Get the broom, Bee, and sweep off the steps. I shall be glad when the  blossoms are gone. They make such a litter.\"    \"Why, Aunt Annie, glad when the blossoms are gone? You can't mean it.  Just look at those trees! Did you ever see anything so pretty?\"    \"They are pretty enough, child,\" returned Mrs. Raymond carelessly.  \"There! cease your rhapsodies, and get the broom. When you have seen as  many Springs as I have you won't be quite so ecstatic over them.\"    \"I believe that I'll always feel just as I do now,\" declared Bee as she  ran for the broom. \"When the trees begin to bud something gets into my  being that makes me feel like--like--Oh, like Alexander the Great: that  I could conquer the world.\"    \"It's the wine of youth in your blood, Bee.\" The lady smiled at the  girl's enthusiasm. \"That's what it is to be young. You are very like  your father.\"    \"Am I, auntie?\" Beatrice flushed with pleasure.    \"Yes. At least you are in regard to your feeling for Nature. He sees  beauty in everything; or used to do so. It seems to be a family trait of  the Raymonds. I don't notice it so much in Adele; but then she takes  after my people.\"    \"Perhaps it is because she is so beautiful herself,\" remarked Bee  meditatively. \"I've noticed that people don't prize what they themselves  possess.\"    \"Don't say that, Bee. You are far from being homely,\" spoke Mrs. Raymond  graciously, noting a trace of wistfulness in her niece's tone. \"Beside,  'Beauty is only skin--'\"    \"Yes; I know, Aunt Annie. Spare me!\" The girl put her hand in laughing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#2)"],[1," another sort of squirrel, which lives in the woods of  America, and is even a much better leaper than ours. It is called the  flying squirrel, though that is not a very proper name, for it cannot  really fly; I mean that it cannot raise itself from the ground, like a  bird can. But it can leap to a surprising distance, for besides a large  bushy tail, it has a very curious membrane, or skin, on each side of  its body, reaching from the fore to the hind leg. So when the flying  squirrel leaps, it stretches out this skin as wide as possible, and as  the air bears it up, it appears almost to _fly_ from one tree to  another. Travellers who have seen them, tell us that when a number of  them leap at the same time, they appear, at a distance, like leaves  blown off by the wind.          CHAPTER II.      After several days of cold wintry weather, the sun burst through the  clouds again, calling into life plants, and insects, _and squirrels_.  Brush and his wife, and their three children, who were born the  preceding summer, and had lived with their parents through the winter,  were all awake and enjoying themselves again. How they frolicked and  chased each other about from tree to tree, and played at hide-and-seek  among the branches! You would have thought that they had laid wagers  with each other, who should venture upon the most difficult and  dangerous leaps.    Then what feasting there was upon buds and young bark! and though this  fresh green food was very nice as a change, still they all seemed to  agree with our friend Brush, that nuts and acorns were not to be  despised neither.    Once or twice the gamekeeper gave the young squirrels a terrible fright  by shouting to them, when they were making free with the tender bark of  his master's trees; but their parents told them, as they had often done  before, that there was nothing to fear from Harvey, nor from his  frightful looking gun. I hope you have not forgotten who it was that  had saved the lives of so many squirrels. But if Harvey's frolicsome  young spaniels, Flora and Juno, had met with one of our friends at a  distance from any tree, I am afraid it would have been a bad business,  for squirrels cannot run very fast on the ground, and their bushy tails  seem rather in the way there. And the cunning little animals appear to  know this, for though they sometimes come down to the ground, you will  very seldom see them at any great distance from a tree.    A few days after the squirrels roused themselves from their long winter  sleep, their cousins, the dormice, in the thicket at the foot of the  tree, opened their sleepy eyes at last, and came out of their nests.  But when they were once thoroughly awake, their eyes did not look  sleepy at all, but on the contrary, were most beautifully bright and  dark, and rather large for the size of the animal.    [Illustration: THE DORMICE. Page 23.]    I call the dormouse a relation to the squirrel,[2] because in some  respects, he is really very like him, though at first sight you would  not think so, and would perhaps say, that he was very little different  from a common mouse, except in being rather fatter, and of a prettier  colour. But his tail, though not nearly so large and bushy, is  something like the squirrel's, and not at all like that of the mouse,  which is almost entirely bare of hair, and in my opinion, has a very  ugly and disagreeable appearance. The tail of the dormouse is handsome,  and useful also, for when he sleeps he curls it over his head and back,  to keep him warm and comfortable. Then in his habits he resembles the  squirrel, for like him he can climb trees well, though he cannot leap  very far, and he likes to dwell in the shade and retirement of the  pleasant woods, far from the habitations of man. Here he generally  makes his nest, which is composed of moss and leaves, in the thickest  parts of bushes or underwood, and he lays up a winter store, like the  squirrel.          [2] The genus _myoxus_, to which the dormouse belongs, appears to        be intermediate between the genera _sciurus_ and _mus_, in each        of which this animal has been placed by different naturalists.    Dormice are such sociable little creatures, that several families are  sometimes found living close together, like those that had chosen their  habitations at the foot of our squirrel's great oak-tree. Perhaps  before I have finished this tale I may have something more to tell you  about little Gotobed, the dormouse.    Do you suppose that Brush and his family spent the whole of the summer  in frolicking and feasting? No, indeed! for even squirrels have work to  do, and duties to perform. So, after a few days spent in the merry way  I have described, one afternoon, when their children were gone on an  excursion to the larch-grove, Mr. and Mrs. Brush perched themselves up  on the topmost branch of their own oak-tree, and had some very serious  conversation together. At least, they meant that the conversation  should be serious; but Brush was such a merry waggish fellow, that he  seldom could talk very long upon any subject without a laugh or a joke.    \"Well, my dear,\" he began very gravely, \"this is the third family you  and I have seen playing around us. For three years we have lived  happily together in this old oak, and a finer tree or a more  comfortable nest than ours I do not believe can be found in the whole  world.\"    Here in the gaiety of his heart he darted off to a neighbouring bough,  and after performing a few strange antics for his companion's  amusement, he was again perched up by her side, and went on with his  speech.    \"Three years,\" continued he, \"yes, I declare, it is three years since I  persuaded you to have nothing more to say to that tiresome old fellow  Bigtail, and to take me for a companion instead.\"    \"Come, come, you rogue,\" said his wife, \"if this is the serious  conversation you wanted to have with me, you may as well hold your  tongue.\"    \"Ha! ha!\" he proceeded without attending to the interruption, \"ha! ha!  I remember that conceited old fellow Bigtail, and how you preferred him  to me, because his tail was the least bit in the world longer than  mine. I made him ashamed of his fine tail though at last. Oh, what fun!  I shall never forget it! He was stuck up by your side, talking the most  ridiculous stuff, I dare say, when I leaped down suddenly upon him from  the branch above. I never did anything better in my life! Over he went  like a dead thing. The old fellow was too much frightened, and too  stiff in his joints, to catch hold of the boughs below, so down he  tumbled to the ground. I declare I thought he was killed! But no, he  only broke--ha! ha! ha! I am ready to die when I think of it--he only  _broke his tail_! Ha! ha! he never could hold it up over his back  afterwards, so there it was always dragging behind him, like a bundle  of dead grass. What a ridiculous old fellow! After that tumble, he  always went by the name Brokentail, instead of Bigtail; and from that  time you never could abide him, you know.\"    \"Really, Mr. Brush,\" said his partner, \"if you make such a fool of  yourself, I wont speak another word to you all day. What has all this  nonsense to do with the serious conversation you wished to have with me  about the children?\"    \"Oh yes, it was about the children I wanted to talk to you,\" replied  Brush, \"and not about old Broken----. Well, well, I wont say anything  more about him, then, so come and sit down quietly again, and I'll be  very serious indeed! There! now we are all right once more. Well, my  dear, now then about these children of ours. I believe you know what I  am going to say--_we must part from them_, Mrs. Brush! It is high time  for you and me to see about putting the nest in order for another  family, and these three children of ours must go and see the world, and  find companions for themselves, for the rest of their lives. I only  hope that when the boys are seeking for companions they will not break  their tails like old ----; I mean, I hope they will both meet with as  good a partner as their mother has been to me.\"    The two old squirrels had a great deal more talk upon this subject, but  as conversation about family affairs is often rather tiresome, I shall  not repeat all they said about the matter. Though they both regretted  parting from their children, they were convinced that a separation was  necessary, and they agreed that the sooner it took place the better.    Perhaps you may think they were rather unamiable and hard-hearted, in  treating their children in this manner; but you must remember that,  though these were not yet a year old, they were very nearly, if not  quite, as large as their parents, and were well able to take care of  themselves.    When the young squirrels were informed of this determination, they were  very sorry at first; but the thoughts of being their own masters, and  of having comfortable nests of their own, reconciled them to the  separation. I never heard what good advice their parents gave them at  parting, but I have not the least doubt that Brush cautioned them to  beware of the sad fate of old Brokentail.    So the three children, leaving their native tree, set off by themselves  into the wide world, and I have nothing more to tell you about _them_.  We must see what Brush and his companion did during the rest of the  summer, what adventures they met with, and what new acquaintances they  found among the various animals that lived in the neighbourhood of  their beautiful oak-tree.    Here I must give you a short description of the place where this tree  grew, and where it had flourished for five or six hundred years at  least.    It was in a small, but very beautiful valley, through which ran a brook  of the clearest water imaginable. This little stream came down from the  hills, and ran through the upper part of the valley, in a very furious  manner, as if it were in a hurry to be"]]]
