Their Ikram amounts to eight purses, and they number from a hundred to  a hundred and fifty families.    The Ahali[FN#12] (burghers) or Madani properly speaking, who have homes  and families, and were born in Al-Madinah. They claim six purses.    The Mujawirin, strangers, as Egyptians or Indians, settled at, though  not born in, Al-Madinah. Their honorarium is four purses.    The Madani traveller, on arrival at Constantinople, reports his arrival  to his Consul, the Wakil al-Haramayn. This Agent of the two Holy Places  applies to the Nazir al-Aukaf, or Intendant of Bequests; the latter,    [p.8]after transmitting the demand to the different officers of the  treasury, sends the money to the Wakil, who delivers it to the  applicant. This gift is sometimes squandered in pleasure, more often  profitably invested either in merchandise or in articles of home-use,  presents of dress and jewellery for the women, handsome arms,  especially pistols and Balas[FN#13] (yataghans), silk tassels, amber  pipe-pieces, slippers, and embroidered purses. They are packed up in  one or two large Sahharahs, and then commences the labour of returning  home gratis. Besides the Ikram, most of the Madani, when upon these  begging trips, are received as guests by great men at Constantinople.  The citizens whose turn it is not to travel, await the Aukaf and  Sadakat (bequests and alms),[FN#14] forwarded every year by the  Damascus Caravan; besides which, as has been before explained, the  Harim supplies even those not officially employed in it with many  perquisites.    Without these advantages Al-Madinah would soon be abandoned to  cultivators and Badawin. Though commerce is here honourable, as  everywhere in the East, business is slack,[FN#15] because the higher  classes prefer the idleness of administering their landed estates, and  being servants to the Mosque. I heard of only four respectable houses,  Al-Isawi, Al-Shaab, Abd al-Jawwad, and a family from Al-Shark (the  Eastern Region).[FN#16] They all deal in grain, cloth, and provisions,  and perhaps the richest have a capital of twenty thousand dollars.  Caravans in    [p.9]the cold weather are constantly passing between Al-Madinah and  Egypt, but they are rather bodies of visitors to Constantinople than  traders travelling for gain. Corn is brought from Jeddah by land, and  imported into Yambu or via Al-Rais, a port on the Red Sea, one day and a  halfs journey from Safra. There is an active provision trade with the  neighbouring Badawin, and the Syrian Hajj supplies the citizens with  apparel and articles of luxurytobacco, dried fruits, sweetmeats, knives,  and all that is included under the word notions. There are few  store-keepers, and their dealings are petty, because articles of every  kind are brought from Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople. As a general  rule, labour is exceedingly expensive,[FN#17] and at the Visitation  time a man will demand fifteen or twenty piastres from a stranger for  such a trifling job as mending an umbrella. Handicraftsmen and  artisanscarpenters, masons, locksmiths, potters, and othersare either  slaves or foreigners, mostly Egyptians.[FN#18] This proceeds partly  from the pride of the people. They are taught from their childhood that  the Madani is a favoured being, to be respected however vile or  schismatic; and that the vengeance of Allah will fall upon any one who  ventures to abuse, much more to strike him.[FN#19] They receive a  stranger at the shop window with the haughtiness of Pashas, and take  pains to show him, by words as well as by looks, that they consider  themselves as    [p.10]good gentlemen as the king, only not so rich. Added to this pride  are indolence, and the true Arab prejudice, which, even in the present  day, prevents a Badawi from marrying the daughter of an artisan. Like  Castilians, they consider labour humiliating to any but a slave; nor is  this, as a clever French author remarks, by any means an unreasonable  idea, since Heaven, to punish man for disobedience, caused him to eat  daily bread by the sweat of his brow. Besides, there is degradation,  moral and physical, in handiwork compared with the freedom of the  Desert. The loom and the file do not conserve courtesy and chivalry  like the sword and spear; man extends his tongue, to use an Arab phrase,  when a cuff and not a stab is to be the consequence of an injurious  expression. Even the ruffian becomes polite in California, where his  brother-ruffian carries his revolver, and those European nations who  were most polished when every gentleman wore a rapier, have become the  rudest since Civilisation disarmed them.    By the tariff quoted below it will be evident that Al-Madinah is not a  cheap place.[FN#20] Yet the citizens,    [p.11]despite their being generally in debt, manage to live well. Their  cookery, like that of Meccah, has borrowed something from Egypt,  Turkey, Syria, Persia, and India: as all Orientals, they are  exceedingly fond of clarified butter.[FN#21]    [p.12]I have seen the boy Mohammed drink off nearly a tumbler-full,  although his friends warned him that it would make him as fat as an  elephant. When a man cannot enjoy clarified butter in these countries,  it is considered a sign that his stomach is out of order, and all my  excuses of a melancholic temperament were required to be in full play  to prevent the infliction of fried meat swimming in grease, or that  guest-dish,[FN#22] rice saturated with meltedperhaps I should sayrancid  butter. The Samn of Al-Hijaz, however, is often fresh, being brought in  by the Badawin; it has not therefore the foul flavour derived from the  old and impregnated skin-bag which distinguishes the ghi of India.[FN#23]  The house of a Madani in good circumstances is comfortable, for the  building is substantial, and the attendance respectable. Black  slave-girls here perform the complicated duties of servant-maids in  England; they are taught to sew, to cook, and to wash, besides sweeping  the house and drawing water for domestic use. Hasinah (the Charmer, a  decided misnomer) costs from $40 to $50; if she be a mother, her value  is less; but neat-handedness, propriety of demeanour, and skill in  feminine accomplishments, raise her to $100=£25. A little black boy,  perfect in all his points, and tolerably intelligent, costs about a  thousand piastres; girls are dearer, and eunuchs fetch double that sum.  The older the children become, the    [p.13]more their value diminishes; and no one would purchase[,] save  under exceptional circumstances, an adult slave, because he is never  parted with but for some incurable vice. The Abyssinian, mostly Galla,  girls, so much prized because their skins are always cool in the  hottest weather, are here rare; they seldom sell for less than £20, and  they often fetch £60. I never heard of a Jariyah Bayza, a white slave  girl, being in the market at Al-Madinah: in Circassia they fetch from  £100 to £400 prime cost, and few men in Al-Hijaz could afford so expensive  a luxury. The Bazar at Al-Madinah is poor, and as almost all the slaves  are brought from Meccah by the Jallabs, or drivers, after exporting the  best to Egypt, the town receives only the refuse.[FN#24]    The personal appearance of the Madani makes the stranger wonder how  this mongrel population of settlers has acquired a peculiar and almost  an Arab physiognomy. They are remarkably fair, the effect of a cold  climate; sometimes the cheeks are lighted up with red, and the hair is  a dark chestnutat Al-Madinah I was not stared at as a white man. The  cheeks and different parts of the childrens bodies are sometimes marked  with Mashali or Tashrih, not the three long stripes of the  Meccans,[FN#25] but little scars generally in threes. In some points  they approach very near the true Arab type, that is to say, the Badawi  of ancient and noble family. The cheek-bones are high and saillant, the  eye small, more round than long,    [p.14] piercing, fiery, deep-set, and brown rather than black. The head  is small, the ears well-cut, the face long and oval, though not  unfrequently disfigured by what is popularly called the lantern-jaw; the  forehead high, bony, broad, and slightly retreating, and the beard and  mustachios scanty, consisting of two tufts upon the chin, with,  generally speaking, little or no whisker. These are the points of  resemblance between the city and the country Arab. The difference is  equally remarkable. The temperament of the Madani is not purely  nervous, like that of the Badawi, but admits a large admixture of the  bilious, and, though rarely, the lymphatic. The cheeks are fuller, the  jaws project more than in the pure race, the lips are more fleshy, more  sensual and ill-fitting; the features are broader, and the limbs are  stouter and more bony. The beard is a little thicker, and the young  Arabs of the towns are beginning to imitate the Turks in that  abomination to their ancestorsshaving. Personal vanity, always a ruling  passion among Orientals, and a hopeless wish to emulate the flowing  beards of the Turks and the Persiansperhaps the only nations in the  world who ought not to shave the chinhave overruled even the religious  objections to such innovation. I was more frequently appealed to at  Al-Madinah than anywhere else, for some means of removing the  opprobrium Kusah, or scant-bearded man. They blacken the beard with  gall-nuts, henna, and other preparations, especially the Egyptian  mixture, composed of sulphate of iron one part, ammoniure of iron one  part, and gall-nuts two parts, infused in eight parts of distilled  water. It is a very bad dye. Much refinement of dress is now found at  Al-Madinah,Constantinople, the Paris of the East, supplying it with the  newest fashions. Respectable men wear either a Benish or a Jubbah; the  latter, as at Meccah, is generally of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#2)"],[1,"seventeen heretical and eleven  objectionable doctrines in his writings.    This bull is interesting as showing what were the points in  Eckhart's teaching which in the fourteenth century were considered  dangerous. They also indicate very accurately what are the real  errors into which speculative mysticism is liable to fall, and how  thinkers of this school may most plausibly be misrepresented by  those who differ from them. After expressing his sorrow that \"a  certain Teuton named Ekardus, doctor, ut fertur, sacrae paginae, has  wished to know more than he should,\" and has sown tares and thistles  and other weeds in the field of the Church, the Pope specifies the  following erroneous statements as appearing in Eckhart's  writings[5]:--1. \"God created the world as soon as God was. 2. In  every work, bad as well as good, the glory of God is equally  manifested. 3. A man who prays for any particular thing prays for an  evil and prays ill, for he prays for the negation of good and the  negation of God, and that God may be denied to him.[6] 4. God is  honoured in those who have renounced everything, even holiness and  the kingdom of heaven. 5. We are transformed totally into God, even  as in the Sacrament the bread is converted into the Body of Christ.  Unum, non simile. 6. Whatever God the Father gave to His  only-begotten Son in His human nature, He has given it all to me. 7.  Whatever the Holy Scripture says about Christ is verified in every  good and godlike man. 8. External action is not, properly speaking,  good nor divine; God, properly speaking, only works in us internal  actions. 9. God is one, in every way and according to every reason,  so that it is not possible to find any plurality in Him, either in  the intellect or outside it; for he who sees two, or sees any  distinction, does not see God; for God is one, outside number and  above number, for one cannot be put with anything else, but follows  it; therefore in God Himself no distinction can be or be understood.  10. All the creatures are absolutely nothing: I say not that they  are small or something, but that they are absolutely nothing.\" All  these statements are declared to have been found in his writings. It  is also \"objected against the said Ekardus\" that he taught the  following two articles in these words:--1. \"There is something in  the soul, which is uncreated and uncreatable: if the whole soul were  such, it would be uncreated and uncreatable: and this is the  intelligence.[7] 2. God is not good or better or best: I speak ill  when I call God good; it is as if I called white black.\"[8] The bull  declares all the propositions above quoted to be heretical, with the  exception of the three which I have numbered 8-10, and these \"have  an ill sound\" and are \"very rash,\" even if they might be so  supplemented and explained as to bear an orthodox sense.    This condemnation led to a long neglect of Eckhart's writings. He  was almost forgotten till Franz Pfeiffer in 1857 collected and  edited his scattered treatises and endeavoured to distinguish those  which were genuine from those which were spurious. Since Pfeiffer's  edition fresh discoveries have been made, notably in 1880, when  Denifle found at Erfurt several important fragments in Latin, which  in his opinion show a closer dependence on the scholastic theology,  and particularly on St Thomas Aquinas, than Protestant scholars,  such as Preger, had been willing to allow. But the attempt to prove  Eckhart a mere scholastic is a failure; the audacities of his German  discourses cannot be explained as an accommodation to the tastes of  a peculiar audience. For good or evil Eckhart is an original and  independent thinker, whose theology is confined by no trammels of  authority.    Sect. 3. ECKHART'S RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY    The Godhead, according to Eckhart, is the universal and eternal  Unity comprehending and transcending all diversity. \"The Divine  nature is Rest,\" he says in one of the German discourses; and in the  Latin fragments we find: \"God rests in Himself, and makes all things  rest in Him.\" The three Persons of the Trinity, however, are not  mere modes or accidents,[9] but represent a real distinction within  the Godhead. God is unchangeable, and at the same time an  \"everlasting process.\" The creatures are \"absolutely nothing\"; but  at the same time \"God without them would not be God,\" for God is  love, and must objectify Himself; He is goodness, and must impart  Himself. As the picture in the mind of the painter, as the poem in  the mind of the poet, so was all creation in the mind of God from  all eternity, in uncreated simplicity. The ideal world was not  created in time; \"the Father spake Himself and all the creatures in  His Son\"; \"they exist in the eternal Now\"[10]--\"a  becoming without a becoming, change without change.\" \"The Word of  God the Father is the substance of all that exists, the life of all  that lives, the principle and cause of life.\" Of creation he says:  \"We must not falsely imagine that God stood waiting for something to  happen, that He might create the world. For so soon as He was God,  so soon as He begat His coeternal and coequal Son, He created the  world.\" So Spinoza says: \"God has always been before the creatures,  without even existing before them. He precedes them not by an  interval of time, but by a fixed eternity.\" This is not the same as  saying that the world of sense had no beginning; it is possible that  Eckhart did not mean to go further than the orthodox scholastic  mystic, Albertus Magnus, who says: \"God created things from  eternity, but the things were not created from eternity.\" St  Augustine (Conf. xi. 30) bids objectors to \"understand that there  can be no time without creatures, and cease to talk nonsense.\"  Eckhart also tries to distinguish between the \"interior\" and the  \"exterior\" action of God. God, he says, is in all things, not as  Nature, not as Person, but as Being. He is everywhere, undivided;  yet the creatures participate in Him according to their measure.[11]  The three Persons of the Trinity have impressed their image upon the  creatures, yet it is only their \"nothingness\" that keeps them  separate creatures. Most of this comes from the Neoplatonists, and  much of it through the pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a  Platonising Christian of the fifth century, whose writings were  believed in the Middle Ages to proceed from St Paul's Athenian  convert. It would, however, be easy to find parallels in St  Augustine's writings to most of the phases quoted in this paragraph.  The practical consequences will be considered presently.    The creatures are a way from God; they are also a way to Him. \"In  Christ,\" he says, \"all the creatures are one man, and that man is  God.\" Grace, which is a real self-unfolding of God in the soul, can  make us \"what God is by Nature\"--one of Eckhart's audacious phrases,  which are not really so unorthodox as they sound. The following  prayer, which appears in one of his discourses, may perhaps be  defended as asking no more than our Lord prayed for (John xvii.) for  His disciples, but it lays him open to the charge, which the Pope's  bull did not fail to urge against him, that he made the servant  equal to his Lord. \"Grant that I, by Thy grace, may be united to Thy  Nature, as Thy Son is eternally one in Thy Nature, and that grace  may become my nature.\"    The ethical aim is to be rid of \"creatureliness,\" and so to be  united to God. In Eckhart's system, as in that of Plotinus,  speculation is never divorced from ethics. On our side the process  is a negative one. All our knowledge must be reduced to  not-knowledge; our reason and will, as well as our lower faculties,  must transcend themselves, must die to live. We must detach  ourselves absolutely \"even from God,\" he says. This state of  spiritual nudity he calls \"poverty.\" Then, when our house is empty  of all else, God can dwell there: \"He begets His Son in us.\" This  last phrase has always been a favourite with the mystics. St Paul  uses very similar language, and the Epistle to Diognetus, written in  the second century, speaks of Christ as, \"being ever born anew in  the hearts of the saints.\" Very characteristic, too, is the doctrine  that complete detachment from the creatures is the way to union with  God. Jacob Bhme has arrived independently at the same conclusion as  Eckhart. \"The scholar said to his master: How may I come to the  supersensual life, that I may see God and hear Him speak? The master  said: When thou canst throw thyself but for a moment into that place  where no creature dwelleth, then thou hearest what God speaketh. The  scholar asked: Is that near or far off? The master replied: It is in  thee, and if thou canst for a while cease from all thy thinking and  willing, thou shalt hear unspeakable words of God. The scholar said:  How can I hear, when I stand still from thinking and willing? The  master answered: When thou standest still from the thinking and  willing of self, the eternal hearing, seeing, and speaking will be  revealed to thee, and so God heareth and seeth through thee.\"    In St Thomas Aquinas it is \"the will enlightened by reason\" which  unites us to God. But there are two sorts of reason. The passive  reason is the faculty which rises through discursive thinking to  knowledge. The active reason is a much higher faculty, which exists  by participation in the divine mind, \"as the air is light by  participation in the sunshine.\" When this active reason is regarded  as the standard of moral action, it is called by Aquinas  synteresis.[12] Eckhart was at first content with this teaching of  St Thomas, whom he always cites with great reverence; but the whole  tendency of his thinking was to leave the unprofitable  classification of faculties in which the Victorine School almost  revelled, and to concentrate his attention on the union of the soul  with God. And therefore in his more developed teaching,"]]]
