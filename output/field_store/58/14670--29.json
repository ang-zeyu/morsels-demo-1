There are representatives of many Asiatic races,  including not only the volunteers from the native States of India, but  elements from the French colony in Cochin China, with Annam, Cambodia,  Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang Chau Wan. England and France both contribute  many African tribes, including Arabs from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese,  Saharans, and many of the South African races. The red races of North  America are represented in the armies of both Canada and the United  States, while the Maoris, Samoans, and other Polynesian races are  likewise represented. And as, in the American Army, there are men of  German, Austrian, and Hungarian descent, and, in all probability,  contingents also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood, it may be said that  Foch commands an army representing the whole human race, united in  defense of the ideals of the Allies. The presence, among Foch's  strategic reserves, of 250,000 Italian soldiers is peculiarly  interesting, as no Italian force at all comparable to this in numbers  seems ever to have operated on French soil, though French armies have  again and again fought in Italy. During the early wars of Napoleon this  was the case, and again in 1859, when the battles of Magenta and  Solferino gave names to two new shades of red. In 1870 also there were  French troops in Rome; their withdrawal, in the Summer of that year,  opened the way for the final union of Italy.      MEETING OF THE GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN EMPERORS    The German and Austrian Emperors held a consultation at German Great  Headquarters on May 12 to discuss future relations between the two  empires. Emperor Karl was accompanied by Foreign Minister Burian, Field  Marshal von Arz, Chief of the General Staff, and Prince Hohenlohe,  Austrian Ambassador at Berlin. Germany was represented by Imperial  Chancellor von Hertling, Field Marshal von Hindenburg, General  Ludendorff, Foreign Secretary von Kuehlmann, and Count von Wedel,  Ambassador at Vienna.    According to an official statement issued in Berlin, all the fundamental  political, economic, and military questions affecting present and future  relations were thoroughly discussed, and \"there was complete accord on  all these questions, tending to deepen the existing alliance.\" In many  quarters the impression prevailed that the result of the meeting  was to define and recognize formally the subservient relations of  Austria-Hungary toward the German Empire. The State Department at  Washington made public a report based upon indications given by the  Berlin newspapers that the agreement made at the meeting concerned three  points:        1. The duration of the alliance was fixed for twenty-five years.        2. Germany and Austria-Hungary are to sign a military convention      imposing upon each much stricter military obligations than did the      preceding treaty.        3. The economic relations will be regulated so as to realize the      plan of Mitteleuropa.    A solution of the Polish question was also arrived at, according to a  newspaper statement published in Berlin, on the lines of complete union  between Austria-Hungary and Poland. Another message said that the German  and Austrian Emperors had selected monarchs for Poland, Lithuania,  Courland, and Esthonia. It was officially stated that no actual treaty  was signed.    One of the most interesting subsequent revelations was that King Ludwig  of Bavaria and King Frederick August of Saxony were also present at the  meeting at German Great Headquarters. Some of the reports represented  these two monarchs as having been present uninvited.      THE PRINCE SIXTUS LETTER    Arthur J. Balfour, British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, replying to  inquiries in the House of Commons, May 16, stated that Emperor Karl's  peace letter to Prince Sixtus, which had been received while Mr. Balfour  was in America, was        a private letter written by Emperor Charles to a relative (Prince      Sixtus of Bourbon) and conveyed by him to President Poincare and the      French Premier under seal of the strictest secrecy, but with no      permission to communicate it to any one except the Sovereign and      Premier of this country, [Great Britain.] The letter was      communicated to the French and English Premiers under these pledges.    He stated that he had no secrets from President Wilson, and added:  \"Every thought I have on the war or on the diplomacy connected with the  war is as open to President Wilson as to any other human being.\" He  declared that he regarded the Sixtus letter as not a peace effort, but a  manoeuvre to divide the Allies. He declared that they were not fighting  for \"a bigger Alsace-Lorraine than in 1870,\" and added:        If any representative of any belligerent country desires seriously      to lay before us any proposals we are ready to listen to them.      Lord Robert Cecil, Minister of Blockade, in the same debate, after  indorsing the preceding statement of Mr. Balfour, added this reference  to Russia:        We have no quarrel with Russia at all. On the contrary, with the      Russian people we have always desired to be on the closest possible      terms of friendship. We are anxious to do all we can to support and      assist the Russian people to preserve Russia as a great country, not      only now, but in the period after the war.    Lord Robert denied that Great Britain had any quarrel with the  Bolsheviki over their domestic policy, saying:        That is a matter for Russia, and Russia alone; we have no other      desire than to see Russia great, powerful, and non-German.      ATTACKS ON HOSPITAL SHIPS    The British Admiralty issued an official announcement on May 1, stating  that it was considered proved conclusively that the British hospital  ship Guildford Castle was attacked by a German submarine in the Bristol  Channel, March 10, and narrowly escaped destruction. At the time the  Guilford Castle was carrying 438 wounded soldiers and flying a Red  Cross flag of the largest size with distinguishing marks distinctly  illuminated. The attack occurred at 5:35 P. M., in clear weather. Two  torpedoes were fired. In evidence of attacks on hospital ships the  British Admiralty quotes the following extracts from the German official  message, sent through the German wireless stations on April 24, 1918:        With respect to the results of the submarine war for the month of      march, the Deutsche Tageszeitung says: \"Lloyd George and Geddes      falsify the losses of ships plying in the military service (?      ignoring) so-called naval losses, auxiliary cruisers, guard ships,      _hospital ships_, and very probably also troop transports and      munition steamers, that is to say, precisely that shipping space      _which is particularly exposed to and attacked by the U-boats_.      TWO MORE LATIN-AMERICAN REPUBLICS ALIGNED AGAINST GERMANY    On April 22, 1918, the National Assembly of Guatemala declared that that  republic occupied the same position toward the European belligerents as  did the United States. Guatemala had broken off diplomatic relations  with Germany in April, 1917. On May 7 Nicaragua declared war against  Germany and her allies. The declaration was in the form of a  recommendation of President Chamorro, which the Nicaraguan Congress  adopted with only four dissenting votes. A further declaration was  adopted of solidarity with the United States and the other American  republics at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Nicaragua was the  twentieth nation to declare war against Germany. Uruguay remains a  neutral at this writing. On April 12 the Government asked Berlin,  through Switzerland, whether Germany considered that a state of war  existed with Uruguay, as stated by the commander of a submarine who had  captured a Uruguayan military commission bound for France. The German  Government replied on May 16 that it did not consider that a state of  war existed. Chile refused to ask free passage of Spain for a commission  of Chileans who sought to reach Germany, thereby indicating partiality  to the Germans. Argentina in the President's message, delivered May 18,  1918, reaffirmed its neutrality.      FRANCE'S SECOND TREASON TRIAL.    Duval, who was director of the suppressed Germanophile newspaper, Bonnet  Rouge, was condemned to death May 15 by court-martial for treason, and  six other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment: Marion, assistant  manager, for ten years; Landau, a reporter, eight years; Goldsky, a  reporter, eight years; Joucla, a reporter, five years; Vercasson, two  years and $1,000 fine; Leymarie, former director of the Ministry of the  Interior, two years' imprisonment and $200 fine.    The Bonnet Rouge was an evening paper of decided pacifist tendency,  which lost no occasion of belittling the military and political leaders  and policy, not only of France, but also of England. The attention of  the Government was drawn to it early in 1917, and its editor, Almeyreda,  and its manager, Duval, were under lock and key by August, 1917.    The police investigations showed that the Bonnet Rouge was to a great  extent dependent for its capital upon men whose ardor in the allied  cause had not been notable, and revealed the astonishing fact that M.  Malvy, as Minister of the Interior, had thought fit to subsidize the  paper to the extent of $1,200 a month and to encourage it in other ways.  It also became known to the public that Almeyreda before the war had  been in the closest contact with M. Caillaux and that he had received  from that politician, at the moment when Mme. Caillaux was being tried  for the murder of M. Calmette, the editor of the Figaro, the sum of  $8,000.

This is a fossil beetle. Don't you see the  distinguishing mark of the coleoptera, those two elytra, or wing-covers,  which meet in the median dorsal line? A beetle, but with the shell of a  crustacean instead of mere chitin. That's what led you astray, I expect.  God, what a tale we'll have to tell when we get back to New York! We'll  drop everything else, and spend years, if need be, looking for other  specimens.\"    \"Like fun you will!\" shouted Higby, the astronomer of the party. \"Lemme  tell you right here, Dodd, nobody outside the Museum of Natural History  is going to care a damn about your old fossils. What we're going to do  is to march straight to the true pole, and spend a year taking  observations and parallaxes. If Einstein's brochure, in which he links  up gravitation with magnetism, is correct--\"    \"Fossil beetles!\" Jim Dodd burst out, ignoring the astronomer. \"That  means that in the Tertiary Era, probably, there existed forms of life in  the antarctic continent that have never been found elsewhere. Imagine a  world in which the insect reached a size proportionate to the great  saurians, Captain Storm! I'll wager poor Bram discovered this. That's  why he stayed behind when the Greystoke Expedition came within a hundred  miles of the pole. I'll wager he's left a cairn somewhere with full  details inside it. We've got to find it. We--\"           *       *       *       *       *    But Jim Dodd, suddenly realizing that the rest of the party could hardly  be said to share his enthusiasm in any marked degree, broke off and  looked sulky.    \"You say you found this thing pretty nearly upon the site of the true  pole?\" Captain Storm asked Tommy.    \"Within five miles, I'd say, Captain. The fog was so bad that we  couldn't get our directions very well.\"    \"Well, then, there's going to be no difficulty,\" answered Storm. \"If  this fair weather lasts, we'll be at the pole in another week, and we'll  start making our permanent camp. Plenty of opportunity for all you  gentlemen. As for me, I'm merely a sailor, and I'm trying to be  impartial.    \"And please remember, gentlemen, that we're well into March now, and  likely to have the first storms of autumn on us any day. So let's drop  the argument and remember that we've got to pull together!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy Travers was the only skilled aviator of the expedition, which had  brought two planes with it. It was a queer friendship that had sprung up  between him and Jim Dodd. Tommy, the blase ex-Harvard man, who was known  along Broadway, and had never been able to settle down, seemed as  different as possible from the spectacled, scholarly Dodd, ten years his  senior, red-haired, irascible, and living, as Tommy put it, in the Age  of Old Red Sandstone, instead of in the year 1930 A. D.    It was generally known--though the story had been officially  denied--that there had been trouble in the Greystoke Expedition of three  years before. Captain Greystoke had taken the brilliant, erratic Bram,  of the Carnegie Archaeological Institute, with him, and Bram's history  was a long record of trouble.    It was Bram who had exploded the faked neolithic finds at Mannheim,  thereby earning the undying enmity of certain European savants, but  brilliantly demolishing them when he smashed the so-called Mannheim  stone pitcher (valued at a hundred thousand dollars) with a pocket-axe,  and caustically inquired whether neolithic man used babbit metal rivets  to fasten on his jug handles.           *       *       *       *       *    Bram's brilliant work in the investigation of the origin of the negrito  Asiatic races had been awarded one of the Nobel prizes, and Bram had  declined it in an insulting letter because he disapproved of the year's  prize award for literature.    He had been a storm center for years, embittered by long opposition,  when he joined the Greystoke Expedition for the purpose of investigating  the marine fauna of the antarctic continent.    And it was known that his presence had nearly brought the Greystoke  Expedition to the point of civil war. Rumor said he had been  deliberately abandoned. His enemies hoped he had. The facts seemed to  be, however, that in an outburst of temper he had walked out of camp in  a furious snowstorm and perished. For days his body had been sought in  vain.    Jimmy Dodd had run foul of Bram some years before, when Bram had  published a criticism of one of Dodd's addresses dealing with fossil  monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. In his inimitable way, Bram had  suggested that the problem which came first, the egg or the chicken, was  now seen to be linked up with the Darwinian theory, and solved in the  person of Dodd.    Nevertheless, Jimmy Dodd entertained a devoted admiration for the memory  of the dead scientist. He believed that Bram must have left records of  inestimable importance in a cairn before he died. He wanted to find that  cairn.    And he knew, what a number of Bram's enemies knew, that the dead  scientist had been a morphine addict. He believed that he had wandered  out into the snow under the influence of the drug.           *       *       *       *       *    Dodd, who shared a tent with Tommy, had raved the greater part of the  night about the find.    \"Well, but see here, Jimmy, suppose these beetles did inhabit the  antarctic continent a few million years ago, why get excited?\" Tommy had  asked.    \"Excited?\" bellowed Dodd. \"It opens one of the biggest problems that  science has to face. Why haven't they survived into historic times? Why  didn't they cross into Australia, like the opossum, by the land bridge  then existent between that continent and South America? Beetles five  feet in length, and practically invulnerable! What killed them off? Why  didn't they win the supremacy over man?\"    Jimmy Dodd had muttered till he went to sleep, and he had muttered  worse in his dreams. Tommy was glad that Captain Storm had given them  permission to return to the same spot next morning and look for further  fossils, though his own interest in them was of the slightest.    The dogs were being harnessed next morning when the two men hopped into  the plane. The thermometer was unusually high for the season, for in the  south polar regions the short summer is usually at an end by March.  Tommy was sweating in his furs in a temperature well above the freezing  point. The snow was crusted hard, the sky overcast with clouds, and a  wind was blowing hard out of the south, and increasing in velocity  hourly.    \"A bad day for starting,\" said Captain Storm. \"Looks like one of the  autumn storms was blowing up. If I were you, I'd watch the weather,  Tommy.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy glanced at Dodd, who was huddled in the rear cockpit, fuming at  the delay, and grinned whimsically. \"I guess I can handle her, Captain,\"  he answered. \"It's only an hour's flight to where he found that fossil.\"    \"Just as you please,\" said Storm curtly. He knew that Tommy's judgment  as a pilot could always be relied upon. \"You'll find us here when you  return,\" he added. \"I've counter-manded the order to march. I don't like  the look of the weather at all.\"    Tommy grinned again and pressed the starter. The engine caught and  warmed up. One of the men kicked away the blocks of ice that had been  placed under the skids to serve as chocks. The plane taxied over the  crusted snow, and took off into the south.           *       *       *       *       *    The camp was situated in a hollow among the ice-mountains that rose to a  height of two or three thousand feet all around. Tommy had not dreamed  how strongly the gale was blowing until he was over the top of them.  Then he realized that he was facing a tougher proposition than he had  calculated on. The storm struck the biplane with full force.    A snowstorm was driving up rapidly, blackening the sky. The sun, which  only appeared for a brief interval every day, was practically touching  the horizon as it rose to make its minute arc in the sky. A star was  visible through a rift in the clouds overhead, and the pale daylight in  which they had started had already become twilight.    Tommy was tempted to turn back, but it was only a hundred miles, and  Jimmy Dodd would give him no peace if he did so. So he put the plane's  nose resolutely into the wind, watching his speed indicator drop from a  hundred miles per hour to eighty, sixty, forty--less.    The storm was beating up furiously. Of a sudden the clouds broke into a  deluge of whirling snow.    In a moment the windshield was a frozen, opaque mass. Tommy opened it,  and peered out into the biting air. He could see nothing.... The plane,  caught in the fearful cross-currents that swirl about the southern roof  of the world, was fluttering like a leaf in the wind. The altimeter was  dropping dangerously.    Tommy opened the throttle to the limit, zooming, and, like a spurred  horse, the biplane shot forward and upward. She touched five thousand,  six, seven--and that, for her, was ceiling under those conditions, for a  sudden tremendous shock of wind, coming in a fierce cross-current, swung  her round, tossed her to and fro in the enveloping white cloud. And  Tommy knew that he had the fight of his life upon his hands.           *       *       *       *       *    The compasses, which required considerable daily adjusting to be of use  so near to the pole, had now gone out of use altogether. The air speed  indicator had apparently gone west, for it was oscillating between zero  and twenty. The turn and bank indicator was performing a kind of tango  round the dial. Even the eight-day clock had ceased to function, but  that might have been due to the fact that Tommy had neglected to wind  it. And the oil "]]]
