[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34437"],[0,"Methods of Destroying Rats (#2)"],[1,"are much more effective. While  trapping, all other food should be removed and the trap bait should be  changed often. Rats are very suspicious, and baits and traps should be  handled as little as possible. Increased success may be secured both in  trapping and poisoning if the rats are fed for a night or two with the  kinds of food to be used for bait.      USE OF FERRETS AND DOGS.    A ferret is useful for the purpose of driving rats out of burrows and  other hiding places so that dogs can capture them. An experienced person  with dogs and ferrets trained to work together can kill many rats when  they are numerous. But the amateur ferreter is likely to be greatly  disappointed.    In the rice fields of the far East the natives build numerous piles of  brush and rice straw and leave them for several days until many rats  have taken shelter in them. A portable bamboo inclosure several feet in  height is then set up around each pile in succession and the straw and  brush are thrown out over the top while dogs and men kill the trapped  rodents. Large numbers are killed in this way, and the plan with  modifications may be utilized in America with satisfactory results. A  wire netting of fine mesh may be used for the inclosure. The scheme is  applicable at the removal of grain, straw, or hay stacks, as well as  brush piles.      FUMIGATION.    Rats may be destroyed in their burrows in the fields, and, still more  important, in levees and rice-field dikes, by the use of carbon  bisulphid. A wad of cotton or other absorbent material is saturated with  the liquid and pushed into the burrow, the opening being packed with  soil to prevent escape of the gas. All animals in the burrow are  asphyxiated. Fumigation about buildings is not so effective, as the gas  can not readily be confined.          RAT-PROOF CONSTRUCTION.      The best way of excluding rats from buildings, whether in the city or  country, is by the use of cement in construction. As the advantages of  this material are coming to be generally understood, its use is rapidly  extending to all kinds of building. Dwellings, dairies, barns, stables,  chicken houses, ice houses, bridges, dams, silos, tanks, cisterns,  root-cellars, hotbeds, sidewalks, and curbs are now often made wholly of  concrete. In constructing dwelling houses the additional cost of making  the foundations rat-proof is slight as compared with the advantages. The  cellar walls should have concrete footings and the walls themselves be  laid in cement mortar. The cellar floor should be of \"medium\" rather  than \"lean\" concrete, and all water and drain pipes should be surrounded  with concrete. Even an old cellar may be made rat-proof at comparatively  small expense. Rat holes may be permanently closed by a mixture of  cement, sand, and broken glass or sharp bits of stone.    Rat-proof granaries, corncribs, and poultry houses may be constructed by  a liberal use of concrete in the foundations and floors.    Rats, mice, and sparrows may be excluded from corncribs by the use of  either an inner or an outer covering of fine-mesh wire netting  sufficiently heavy to resist the teeth of rats.    The common custom of setting corncribs upon posts with inverted pans at  the top often fails because the posts are not long enough to insure that  the lower cracks of the structure are beyond jumping reach of rats. The  posts should project at least 3 feet above the surface of the ground.          NATURAL ENEMIES OF RATS.      The value of carnivorous mammals and the larger birds of prey in  destroying rats should be more fully recognized, especially by the  farmer and the game preserver. Chief among the animals that are useful  in destroying these rodents are the fox, skunk, and weasel, and the  larger species of owls and hawks. Rats destroy more poultry and game,  both eggs and young chicks, than all the birds and wild mammals named  combined, yet some of our most useful birds of prey and carnivorous  mammals are persecuted almost to the point of extinction. An enlightened  public sentiment should cause the repeal of all bounties on these  animals and afford protection to the majority of them.          CONCLUSIONS.      By the persistent use of traps, occasional resort to poison, and the  exercise of forethought in the construction of farm buildings so as to  minimize the opportunities for harborage, farmers and others may prevent  the greater part of the loss and annoyance they now experience from rat  depredations. The same statement applies in great measure to city and  village conditions. Hence cooperation in the warfare on rats is  particularly important and can not be too strongly urged."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34449"],[0,"A New Extinct Emydid Turtle from the Lower Pliocene of Oklahoma (#2)"],[1,"further growth the length becomes relatively greater. Specimens in the  length group of 135 to 144 mm. have the widths ranging from 71 to 81 per  cent of the lengths. In all specimens larger than this, the ratio is in  the low seventies, and the largest specimen, 177 mm. in length, has the  width of the carapace amounting to only 74 per cent of the length. The  fossil species, _C. timida_, with a length of 160 mm., has the width  amounting to 75 per cent of the length, and _C. limnodytes_, with an  estimated length of 180 mm., has the width amounting to 80.5 per cent of  the length. _C. timida_ is widest anteriorly, whereas _C. limnodytes_  and the other species of the genus are widest posteriorly.

However, any resemblance to _Pseudemys_ is not to be considered as  evidence that _C. limnodytes_ is in any way ancestral to the genus  _Pseudemys_. The fossil specimens of _Pseudemys_ from the Pliocene are  too poorly known to allow the student certainly to place them in their  correct systematic positions. The fossil Emydids from Western Europe,  listed as species of _Chrysemys_, differ very much from this species, or  belong to other genera of the family.    Only a few turtles are known from the Laverne formation. Hesse (Chaney  and Elias, 1936) reported a small _Testudo_ from the Laverne of Beaver  County, Oklahoma, but neglected to state whether it was among the  material borrowed by him from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural  History. The Museum has an incomplete carapace and plastron (No. 3101)  of a small _Testudo_ from that locality and formation. In Harper County,  Oklahoma, the field party from the University recovered a large number  of fragments of a large _Testudo_. Although this specimen is as yet  unprepared, enough fragments have been pieced together to reveal that  the tibia is 127 mm. long. This dimension and those of some of the  fragments indicate that the animal may have been four to five feet long.    Mrs. Bernita Mansfield of the Geology Department, University of Kansas,  prepared the plate.          LITERATURE CITED      BERGOUNIOUX, FREDERIC-MARIE.      1935.
