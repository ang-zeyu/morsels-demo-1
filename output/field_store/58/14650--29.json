Of this, more in the chapter on breeding.    To buy imported or pedigreeless small toys for breeding is a complete  lottery. Foreign breeders are extremely careless with regard to their  strains, and purity of blood can never be depended on. Another point  which must be insisted upon in relation to profitable toy breeding is  the necessity for health in the kennel. I say kennel because it is a  useful word, but am far from suggesting that toys of any kind should be  kept in the way understood by \"having a kennel\" among larger dogs. The  breeder who succeeds best is invariably the one who keeps one or two, or  even four or five, _pet_ bitches, running about the house enjoying full  liberty and all the happiness of personal favourites, with, it may be, a  dog also of the party. The breeder who is most troubled with skin  complaints, distemper, lengthy vet's bills, and all the expenses, such  as sick diet, which eat up profits, is the one who has built or fitted  \"kennels,\" no matter at what expense, and filled them with dogs.          CHAPTER II    ON BREEDING      Very small bitches, and especially those belonging to certain breeds  which are known to be \"shy,\" are not only often reluctant to breed at  all, but are not infrequently very indifferent mothers, while there are  great risks to the bitch in pupping where the sire is larger than  herself, or where larger dogs occur in the immediate ancestry on either  side. For these reasons, brood bitches are always wisely chosen of  medium size, and mated to very tiny dogs. In all the breeds which come  under the head of toys, smallness is a desideratum, but the practice of  inbreeding which has been extensively resorted to cannot be too highly  condemned; while the equally mistaken idea of attaining this end by  under-feeding puppies has also contributed to the weakliness of  constitution which is an immense drawback to some breeds. Reckoning size  by weight is another faulty practice much against the true interests of  toys, which we want to be small and healthy at the same time; for a very  tiny dog, if compact and sturdy, may weigh much more than a leggy  specimen which, to the eye, seems half as large again.    A bitch from 5 lbs. to 7 lbs., if, as I said before, of a small strain,  may be safely used for breeding, and the smaller the dog the better,  provided he is healthy. The plan of sending away bitches to a stud dog  saves the expense of buying a dog of one's own; the sire's wins help to  sell the puppies very materially, and the good offices of his owner may  generally be reckoned upon to assist the novice; but there are other  facets to the question.    These tiny dogs, which are frequently exhibited, are often very  unreliable sires; they work too hard, and their owners are sometimes  very indifferent as to whether the visiting bitches are satisfactorily  attended to. True, the terms always do, or certainly always should,  include a second visit free if the first proves fruitless, but there is  the loss of time, the disappointment to the owner, and sometimes to the  little bitch herself, who may have been quite anxious to breed and not  have had a fair chance, and the trouble and expense of travelling for  her. On the whole, I am much inclined to advise the novice to, at any  rate, _begin_ by rearing up a male puppy of such breeds as Pekingese and  Griffons, or the scarcer toy Bulldogs, and using it for the home stud;  for the other plan is less likely to result in disappointment when a  little knowledge has been gained of the kennel world in general. This,  of course, unless the whole thing is gone into under the aegis of some  experienced owner, as before suggested. Some little bitches are  exceedingly capricious, and will not take the least notice of a strange  dog, where they would willingly mate with one they knew and liked;  others are so upset by a journey and a strange place as to be useless  _pro tem._; others, again, instead of being ready to breed twice a year,  as is the usual habit of female dogs, may only come in season once in  twelve months, and then but fugitively. In such cases it is a positive  necessity to have a dog on the spot. Where a sire must be chosen from  among strangers, his points should correct any in which the bitch is  deficient; your toy pug may have too small a head, with little  wrinkle--you must look for a dog with good head properties as her mate;  your Pom may be long in back, and you must seek a male with the opposite  quality, and a plume well over and touching his frill.    The first puppies of two young dogs are generally larger than the  parents, but I do not believe the theory often advanced that the first  litter is always the best. Puppies by a very old sire are usually small.    A toy bitch, if sent away, should be carefully packed in a roomy, warm  basket; the provision of draughty, tumble-to-pieces baskets is false  economy, both for show and breeding purposes. If possible, a toy dog of  either sex should have a cosy little basket kennel, with a door, which  it can use at home as a sleeping-place, and in which it can travel; the  basket can be fitted with an outer case of wood for greater security,  but the dog will stand the journey much better if it is in a familiar  basket. Something with a peaked or rounded top should be chosen; the  ventilation being safer in this, as flat-sided and flat-topped packages  may be so crowded upon with others in a guard's van as to suffocate the  inmate.    Illustration: GRIFFON BRUXELLOIS. _\"Sparklets,\" the property of Miss  Johnson._    The usual period of willingness to breed in a toy bitch is, more or  less, one week. This is preceded by about a fortnight's preparation, a  week or so of gradual enlargement of the parts concerned, and a week of  a coloured discharge from the uterus and vagina. Either or all of the  stages may last a longer or shorter time; but three weeks is generally  accepted as the period. No attempt at mating the bitch should be made  during the first two stages; it is when the discharge begins to cease  that she is ready, and the correct judging of this time is what chiefly  puzzles amateurs, though after they have once been through it they will  not find any difficulty. As a rule, bitches are sent away too soon, and  as the conveniences for keeping them at the stud dog's house are often  few, they are cooped up for day after day, and may become quite \"stale\"  and dull before the real mating time comes--a poor prospect. If the two  dogs are in the house together, the male should be kept entirely away  from the female from the very beginning of her attraction for him, until  she is ready, otherwise he will worry her incessantly and become himself  ultimately indifferent and useless in the matter. Toy dogs should never  be left to themselves in breeding matters; it is highly dangerous to do  so, especially if they are young and inexperienced, and I strongly  advise the beginner either to get some experienced breeder to overlook  matters and give advice, or failing this, when the female is ready, to  send the two dogs for a few hours to some kind and sensible veterinary  surgeon. They should be allowed to be together twice, either on  consecutive days, or with a day between.    Once mated, the little toy bitch must be petted and taken good care of:  not over-fed, but given plenty of good, nourishing food, and  systematically exercised. If she is in pup it will become evident about  the fifth to the seventh week. Some dogs show it much more than others;  whether she has puppies or not, she will have the natural provision of  milk for them. If she does not pup, she may very likely come in season  again in half the usual time. A failure to prove in pup is generally  evidenced by a time of great heaviness and dullness, the bitch sleeping  a great deal, getting very fat, and decidedly stupid; under these  circumstances give her extra exercise and one or two small doses of  sulphate of magnesia in food, to ward off skin irritation, a not  uncommon correlative. People are far too apt to decide that \"missing\" is  the bitch's fault; certainly she is apt to miss if she is too fat at the  time of mating, and Nature often, and very sensibly, arranges that she  shall do so when she has been regularly bred from at her seasons for a  number of times; but outside these occasions it is quite as often the  dog's fault as not.    A question which is frequently asked is as to the desirability or  otherwise of giving a toy bitch worm medicine, or an aperient, while she  is in pup or just before her babies arrive. It is as well to give one  mild dose of worm medicine about the end of the third week, if the bitch  is known to be troubled with these parasites to any great extent; but it  would be much better to have dosed her before her breeding time came on.  As to the aperient before pupping which we often see advised, it is a  totally unnecessary interference with Nature, and when castor oil, a  violent irritant to dogs, is employed, it is a sheer piece of cruelty,  likely to have very bad effects.          CHAPTER III    THE TOY BITCH WHEN PUPPING      Too much interference is generally alternated in the case of dogs with a  disregard of their natural feelings where the arrival of puppies is  concerned. It is quite natural that the little bitch, feeling distressed  and uneasy, should claim a great deal of notice and attention, and if  she has been made a pet of she will expect, and deserve, to be allowed  to have her puppies in her mistress's dressing-room or some similar  luxury; in which she should be indulged. But once she has got over the  preliminaries, which I will presently describe, she should, if possible,  be left to herself as far as manual assistance goes. Nature will bring  the puppies into the world far better than our clumsy hands, and the  merest little tyro of a year-old"]]]
