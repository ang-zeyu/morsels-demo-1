[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47182"],[0,"The Vitality of Mormonism: Brief Essays on Distinctive Doctrines of the Church (#2)"],[1," in  proportion as the actuality of its survival has become generally  evident, the assumed certainty of its imminent decline has been the  more confidently proclaimed. The fall of the spreading tree, whose  branches afford unfailing food and shelter, has been predicted time and  again, but never realized.    On the sixth day of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints was organized as a body corporate at Fayette in the  State of New York, with a membership of six persons. True, at that time  a few times six had associated themselves more or less closely with the  new religious movement; but, as the laws of the State specified six as  the minimum required to form a religious corporation, only that number  took part in the legal procedure. And they, save one, were relatively  obscure.    The name of Joseph Smith had already been heard beyond his home  district. He was at the time a subject of widening notoriety if not  of enviable fame. The Book of Mormon, purporting to be a record of  the aboriginal peoples of the Western Continent, had already been  published. In reference to the title page of this work the appellation  \"Mormons\" came to be fastened upon members of the Church.    Such a beginning as that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints would seem to afford little ground of either hope or fear as  to future developments. What was there to cause hostile concern over  the voluntary association of six men and a few of their friends in  an organization of openly expressed purpose, and that, the peaceful  promulgation of what they verily believed to be the uplifting religion  of life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ? Whatever may be the answer to the  query, the fact that the Church met opposition, which for a long period  was increasingly severe, is abundantly attested by history. [1]    Today the \"Mormon\" Church is known, by name at least, throughout the  civilized world, as well as among most of the semi-cultured peoples in  the remoter parts of the earth and on the islands of the sea. The six  have increased to over half a million adherents.    The growth of the organization is apparent to even the poorly informed.  But the Church has not only grown; it has developed. Between growth  and development there is an essential difference; and not a few of  the grave mistakes of men, even in every-day affairs--in business,  in politics, in statesmanship--are traceable to our confusing and  confounding the two. Growth alone is the result of accretion, the  accumulation of material, the amassing of stuff. Development involves  an extension of function, a gradation of efficiency, a passing from  immaturity to maturity, from the seed to the fruiting tree.    Growth produces big things, and not only things of this sort but men.  Between bigness and greatness, however, there is a distinction of kind.  Growth is a measure of bulk, of quantity; it is specified as \"so many\"  or \"so much\"; development is a gradation of quality; its terms are \"so  good\" or \"so bad.\" Our nation boasts a constantly increasing host of  big men; the great men of the country may be more easily counted. And  as with men so with institutions.    Dead things may grow, as witness the tiny salt crystal in its  mother-brine--at first a microscopic cube, then a huge hexahedron  limited only by the size of the container or other external conditions.  Development, however, is the characteristic of life, to which mere  growth is essentially secondary and subordinate.    The vital character of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints has been evident from the first. \"Mormonism\" lives because it  is healthy, normal and undeformed. In general, a healthy organism  is assured of life, barring destruction from external violence or  deprivation of physical necessities; whereas one that is abnormal and  sickly is doomed to decline. Opposition to the Church, the pitiless  maltreatment to which its people have been subjected, particularly in  the earlier decades of its history, comprising mobbings, drivings,  spoliation, scourgings, and assassination, have operated to strengthen  the Church, body and soul. True, the heat of persecution has scorched  and withered a few of the sickly plants, such as had little depth of  sincerity; but the general effect has been to promote a fuller growth,  and to make richer and more fertile the Garden of the Lord.    The Church has never experienced a distinctive period of reduced  membership. Always the present has been the time of its highest  achievement. In spite of persecution, some of which sprang from  misplaced sincerity and zeal while much was born of ignorance and  fanaticism, the strength of the institution, measured in terms of  loyalty, devotion and unswerving adherence to the principles of the  restored Gospel, has steadily increased.    It is a notable fact that its members are imbued with the testimony of  certitude as to the genuineness of the Gospel they have espoused and  the perpetuity of the Church. This has been a distinguishing feature  from the beginning.    Apostasy from the organization is so rare as to be negligible.  Excommunicants, who are deprived of their membership through failure  to live up to the high standard of morality and duty required by the  revealed law of the Church, while not numerous exceed by many fold  those who voluntarily withdraw and affiliate with other religious  bodies.    \"Mormonism\" is definite and incisive in its claims. It speaks to the  world in no uncertain tone. Its voice is virile; its activities are  strong. It presents an unbroken front and is unafraid. Its attitude  is not hostile, though strongly aggressive. Its methods are those of  reason and persuasion, coupled with a fearless affirmation of testimony  as to the surpassing importance of its message, which message it labors  to convey to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.    It is not too much to affirm that the leaven of \"Mormonism\" is  leavening the world and its theology. Every studious reader of recent  commentaries on the Holy Scriptures, and of theological treatises in  general, is aware of a surprising progressiveness in modern views of  things spiritual, amounting in many instances to an abandonment of what  were once regarded as the fundamentals of orthodoxy.    _In the new theology \"Mormonism\" has pioneered the way_.    In its early days the Church received the word of the Lord avouching  the perpetuity of the organization. While no individual was promised  that he should not fall away, and though the forfeiture of the Holy  Spirit's companionship was specified as the sure and incalculable  loss to all who wilfully persisted in sin, the blessed assurance was  given that the Church of Jesus Christ was established for the last  time, never to be destroyed, nor again driven from the earth through  apostasy. Men may come and men may go, but the Church shall go on  forever.    There has never been revision nor amendment in the fundamental law of  the Church, and the only changes are those natural to development,  expansion and adaptation to new conditions.    The world is full of sects and churches, and there is scarcely one that  has not a counterpart in a revised or reformed or reorganized sect.  _But the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is no sect; it  is an original creation, established upon the earth in this age as a  restoration_. There will never be a reformed or reorganized variant of  this, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    The faith of the people is no whit weakened because of their fewness.  This very condition was foretold. Nearly six centuries before the  Savior's birth, a Hebrew prophet on the Western Continent predicted the  establishment of this Church in the last days, and testified of it, as  he had seen in vision, that its members would be found in all parts of  the earth, but that their numbers would be relatively small. See Book  of Mormon, 1 Nephi 14.    \"_Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life,  and few there be that find it_.\" (Matt. 7:14, also Book of Mormon, 3  Nephi 14:14.)    The doors of the Church are open to all, rich and poor, learned and  unlearned; and the pleading invitation to enter and become partakers  of the blessings that pertain both to mortality and to the eternities  beyond is freely extended--_to you and yours and to everybody, near and  afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call_.

When asked for a concise  presentation of the principal doctrines accepted by his people, Joseph  Smith, through whose instrumentality the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints was established, responded with the Articles of Faith  presented below. This was in the year 1841.    From the time of their first promulgation The Articles have been in  force as an authorized statement of belief; and they were early adopted  as such by the Church in general conference assembled.    The Articles of Faith    of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints    1.    We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and  in the Holy Ghost.    2.    We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for  Adam's transgression.    3.    We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be  saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4.    We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel  are:--(1) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; (3)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47192"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"of the Twelve and the Seventy.
