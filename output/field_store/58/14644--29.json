The explanation is that the German  war party could use quotations from the Bolo papers to persuade the  German people that their existence was threatened by the French, thereby  justifying the German Government and rekindling in the people the war  fervor which was fast oozing out of them. Then, when the opportune  moment came, the same ultra-patriotic papers, so it was expected, would  suddenly turn pacifist and thereby stir up dissension in the nation and  destroy the efficiency of its war measures.      THE NUMBERS IN THE WORLD'S GREATEST BATTLES    THE stupendous character of the battle of Picardy is realized when the  numbers engaged in previous noted battles of history are considered.  Setting aside the mythical five millions of the army of Xerxes and the  ten thousand of Xenophon, accurate figures in Greece are recorded for  the campaigns of Philip of Macedon and his more famous son. At  Cheronaea, fought in B. C. 338, Philip had 30,000 infantry and 2,000  cavalry, the latter led by Alexander, then 18 years old. Alexander's  cavalry attack on the flank won the battle, driving back the Athenians  and Thebans, who were slightly outnumbered. At Arbela, in October, 331,  Alexander the Great, with 47,000 Macedonians, defeated a Persian force  three or four times as great, piercing between the Persian left and  centre. Pyrrhus of Epirus had, at Asculum, in the year 279, 45,000  infantry against an equal number of Romans, but he had elephants,  practically equivalent to artillery.    Hannibal at Cannae, in 216, had 50,000 veterans against Varro's 50,000  Romans, who were drawn up with their backs to the sea, and were thus  unable to withdraw before Hannibal's overwhelming onslaught. Julius  Caesar at Alesia had 50,000 Romans against 80,000 Gallic infantry and  15,000 cavalry. At Pharsalus, in the civil war, the Pompeians, with  60,000, were routed by the Caesareans with 25,000, losing 15,000, while  Julius Caesar lost only 200. Augustus Caesar formed a standing army of  300,000, his legions consisting of 3,000 heavy infantry, 1,200 light  infantry, and 300 cavalry each.    Genghiz Khan began with a small force of 6,000, with which he fought and  conquered his father-in-law, who had 10,000. At the Battle of the Indus,  Genghiz Khan commanded a huge army of 300,000 Tartars. At the battle of  Karakin, in 1218, he led 700,000 Tartars against 400,000 Kharismians,  completely defeating them. Oliver Cromwell's army, in its most complete  form, numbered about 80,000. The army of Frederick the Great, at its  highest point of efficiency, numbered 200,000, while the army of Louis  XIV. numbered 240,000 men.    In 1793, when Republican France was threatened with invasion, and Carnot  was \"organizing victory,\" the effective French forces probably numbered  300,000, though the total number available under the newly introduced  system of conscription was four times as many, about a million and a  quarter. At the battle of Auerstadt-Jena, on Oct. 14, 1806, Napoleon had  a French Army of 160,000, against some 140,000 Prussians. About this  time Napoleon made the army corps the practical unit instead of the  division, as formerly. The Grand Army, which invaded Russia in 1812,  totaled 467,000, but this included 280,000 foreign troops. At the battle  of Leipsic, a year after the retreat from Moscow, Napoleon, with  155,000, faced 160,000 Austrians, 60,000 Prussians, and 60,000 Swedes  under the recreant Frenchman Bernadotte, the ancestor of the present  King of Sweden.    At Waterloo, the French Army is said to have numbered 72,000, against  whom were drawn up, at the beginning of the battle, 24,000 British and  43,500 Dutch and Belgian troops. The Dutch and Belgians withdrew before  the end of the battle, their place being taken by Bluecher's contingent.    The forces commanded by George Washington were always numerically small,  a few thousand only, and were in ceaseless flux. In 1790, the American  Army consisted of 1,216 men. In the war of 1812, the invading force,  which burned the national capital, numbered 3,500 men. At the beginning  of the American civil war, the regular army numbered 15,300. Between  April, 1861, and April, 1865, the total Federal forces enrolled amounted  to 2,759,049, while the Confederates enrolled about 1,100,000, making a  total of practically 4,000,000 from a population of 32,000,000; this  would be equivalent to an army of from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 with the  present population of the United States. The total furnished for the war  with Spain was 10,017 officers and 213,218 men.    The Austrian Army at Sadowa numbered 200,000; the French Army at Sedan  some 120,000. At the battle of Mukden, Russians and Japanese each had a  force of about 300,000, the largest number in any modern battle up to  that time, though greatly outnumbered by Genghiz Khan.      EMPEROR CHARLES'S SEPARATE PEACE PLAN    The disclosures regarding Austria's efforts to make a separate peace  with France, which are dealt with elsewhere in this issue of CURRENT  HISTORY MAGAZINE, took a more sensational turn April 11, 1918, when the  following official note was issued by the French Government:    _Once caught in the cogwheels of lying, there is no means of stopping.  Emperor Charles, under Berlin's eye, is taking on himself the lying  denials of Count Czernin, and thus compels the French Government to  supply the proof. Herewith is the text of an autograph letter  communicated on March 31, 1917, by Prince Sixtus de Bourbon, the Emperor  of Austria's brother-in-law, to President Poincare, and communicated  immediately, with the Prince's consent, to the French Premier:_        MY DEAR SIXTUS: The end of the third year of this war, which has      brought so much mourning and grief into the world, approaches.      All the peoples of my empire are more closely united than ever      in the common determination to safeguard the integrity of the      monarchy at the cost even of the heaviest sacrifices.        Thanks to their union, with the generous co-operation of all      nationalities, my empire and monarchy have succeeded in      resisting the gravest assaults for nearly three years. Nobody      can question the military advantages secured by my troops,      particularly in the Balkans.        France, on her side, has shown force, resistance, and dashing      courage which are magnificent. We all unreservedly admire the      admirable bravery, which is traditional to her army, and the      spirit of sacrifice of the entire French people.        Therefore it is a special pleasure to me to note that, although      for the moment adversaries, no real divergence of views or      aspirations separates many of my empire from France, and that I      am justified in hoping that my keen sympathy for France, joined      to that which prevails in the whole monarchy, will forever avoid      a return of the state of war, for which no responsibility can      fall on me.        With this in mind, and to show in a definite manner the reality      of these feelings, I beg you to convey privately and      unofficially to President Poincare that I will support by every      means, and by exerting all my personal influence with my allies,      France's just claims regarding Alsace-Lorraine.        Belgium should be entirely re-established in her sovereignty,      retaining entirely her African possessions without prejudice to      the compensations she should receive for the losses she has      undergone.        Serbia should be re-established in her sovereignty, and, as a      pledge of our good-will, we are ready to assure her equitable      natural access to the Adriatic, and also wide economic      concessions in Austria-Hungary. On her side, we will demand, as      primordial and essential conditions, that Serbia cease in the      future all relation with and suppress every association or group      whose political object aims at the disintegration of the      monarchy, particularly the Serbian political society, Narodni      Ochrana; that Serbia loyally and by every means in her power      prevent any kind of political agitation, either in Serbia or      beyond her frontiers, in the foregoing direction, and give      assurances thereof under the guarantee of the Entente Powers.        The events in Russia compel me to reserve my ideas with regard      to that country until a legal definite Government is established      there.        Having thus laid my ideas clearly before you, I would ask you in      turn, after consulting with these two powers, to lay before me      the opinion first of France and England, with a view thus to      preparing the ground for an understanding on the basis of which      official preliminary negotiations could be taken up and reach a      result satisfactory to all.        Hoping that thus we will soon be able together to put a limit to      the sufferings of so many millions of men and families now      plunged in sadness and anxiety, I beg to assure you of my      warmest and most brotherly affection.        CHARLES.    The reply of Emperor Charles to the foregoing letter was in the form of  the following telegram to Emperor William:        Clemenceau's accusations against me are so low that I have no      intention to discuss longer this affair with France. My cannon      in the west is our last reply.        In faithful friendship,        CHARLES.    As a result of the publication of the letter, whose existence it is  claimed was unknown to him, Count Czernin on April 15 resigned his  portfolio as Foreign Minister and Premier, and accepted appointment as a  Major General in the Austrian Army. He was succeeded by Baron Burian,  who was Minister of Foreign Affairs from Sept. 15, 1914, to Dec. 23,  1916, when he was succeeded by Count Czernin.    It was authoritatively announced that the letter was communicated to the  British, French, and Italian Premiers at a meeting which took place at  St. Jean "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38767"],[0,"Spanish Highways and Byways (#2)"],[1," sapphire waters makes it evident that  there must be an outlet to the ocean. Such a rift, in fact, was  disclosed as the strong-armed old ferry woman rowed us across, a deep  but narrow passage (hence the name) between sheer walls of rock, whose  clefts and crannies thrill the most respectable tourist with longings  to turn smuggler. The village clings with difficulty to its stony  strip between steep and wave. On one side of that single street, the  peering stone houses, some still showing faded coats of arms, are half  embedded in the mountain, and on the other the tide beats perilously  against the old foundation piles.    Above the uneven roofs, on the precipitous hillside, sleep the dead,  watched over by Santa Ana from her neglected hermitage. Only once a  year, on her own feast day, is her gorgeous altar cloth brought forth  and her tall candles lighted, while the rats, who have been nibbling  her gilded shoes and comparing the taste of the blues and crimsons in  her painted robes, skurry into their holes at the unaccustomed sound  of crowding feet. Pasajes boasts, too, a touch of historical dignity.  From here Lafayette, gallant young Frenchman that he was, sailed for  America, and probably then, as now, little Basque girls ran at the  stranger's side with small hands full of wild flowers, and roguish  Basque boys hid behind boulders and tried to frighten him by playing  brigand, with a prodigious waving of thorn-branch guns and booming of  vocal artillery.    But not the joy of beauty nor the pride of ancient memory takes the  place of bread. We approached a factory and asked of the workman at  the entrance, \"What do you manufacture here?\" \"What they manufacture  in all Spain, nowadays,\" he answered, \"misery.\" This particular  misery, however, had the form of tableware, the long rows of simple  cups and plates and pitchers, in various stages of completion, being  diversified by jaunty little images of the Basque ball players, whose  game is famous throughout the Peninsula. We finally succeeded in  purchasing one of these for fifteen cents, although the village was  hard put to it to make change for a dollar, and was obliged, with  grave apologies, to load us down with forty or so big Spanish coppers.    \"The lazy Spaniard!\" Look at the very children as they romp about San  Sebastian. This is the most aristocratic summer resort in Spain, the  Queen Regent having a chalet on that artistic bay called the _Concha_  or Shell. It is a crescent of shimmering color, so dainty and so  perfect, with guardian mountains of jasper and a fringe of diamond  surf, that it is hard to believe it anything but a bit of magical  jewel-work. It might be a city of fairyland, did not the clamor of  childish voices continually break all dreamy spells. What energy and  tireless activity! Up and down the streets, the cleanest streets in  Spain, twinkle hundreds of little _alpargatas_, brightly embroidered  canvas shoes with soles of plaited hemp. Spanish families are large,  although from the ignorance of the mothers and the unsanitary  condition of the homes, the mortality among the children is extreme.  Here is a household, for example, where out of seventeen black-eyed  babies but three have fought their way to maturity. Spanish parents  are notably affectionate, but, in the poorer classes, at least,  impatient in their discipline. It is the morning impulse of the busy  mother, working at disadvantage in her small and crowded rooms, to  clear them of the juvenile uproar by turning her noisy brood out of  doors for the day. Surprisingly neat in their dress but often with  nothing save cabbage in their young stomachs, forth they storm into  the streets. Here the stranger may stand and watch them by the hour as  they bow and circle, toss and tumble, dance and race through an  enchanting variety of games. The most violent seem to please them  best. Now and then a laughing girl stoops to whisk away the beads of  perspiration from a little brother's shining face, but in general they  are too rapt with the excitement of their sports to be aware of  weariness. Such flashing of eyes and streaming of hair and jubilee of  songs!    One of their favorite games, for instance, is this: An especially  active child, by preference a boy, takes the name of _milano_, or  kite, and throws himself down in some convenient doorway, as if  asleep. The others form in Indian file, the _madre_, or mother, at the  head, and the smallest girl, Mariquilla, last in line. The file  proceeds to sing:--         \"We are going to the garden,        Although its wicked warden,        Hungry early and late,        Is crouching before the gate.\"    Then ensues a musical dialogue between the mother and Mariquilla:--         _Mother._       Little Mary in the rear!         _Little Mary._  What's your bidding, mother dear?         _Mother._       Tell me how the kite may thrive.         _Little Mary [after cautiously sidling up to the doorway and       inspecting the prone figure there]._                         He's half dead and half alive.    Then the file chants again:--                         \"We are going to the garden,                       Although its wicked warden,                       Hungry early and late,                       Is crouching before the gate.\"         _Mother._       Little Mary in the rear!         _Little Mary._  What's your bidding, mother dear?         _Mother._       Of the kite I bid you speak.         _Little Mary [after a second reconnoissance, which sends her       scampering back to her own place]._                         He whets his claws and whets his beak.    Here the enemy advances, beating a most appalling tattoo:--         _Kite._         Pum, pum! Tat, tat!         _Mother._       Who is here and what is that?         _Kite._         'Tis the kite.         _Mother._                 What seeks the kite?         _Kite._         Human flesh! A bite, a bite!         _Mother._       You must catch before you dine.                       Children, children, keep the line!    And with this the dauntless parent, abandoning song for action, darts  with outspread arms in front of the robber, who bends all his energies  to reaching and snatching away Little Mary. The entire line, keeping  rank, curves and twists behind the leader, all intent on protecting  that poor midget at the end. And when the wild frolic has resulted in  her capture, and every child is panting with fatigue, they straightway  resume their original positions and play it all over again. In Seville  this game takes on a religious variation, the kite becoming the Devil,  and the _madre_ the angel Michael defending a troop of souls. In Cuba  we have a hawk pitted against a hen with her brood of chickens.    We stepped into a Protestant Kindergarten one day to see how such  stirring atoms of humanity might demean themselves in school. Talk of  little pitchers! Here were some twoscore tiny jugs, bubbling full of  mischief, with one bright, sympathetic girl of twenty-two keeping a  finger on every dancing lid. Impossible, of course! But all her week's  work looked to us impossible. We had known diligent teachers in the  United States; this \"lazy Spaniard,\" however, not only keeps her  Kindergarten well in hand from nine to twelve, but instructs the same  restless mites--so many of them as do not fall into a baby-sleep over  their desks--in reading and counting from two to four, gives a Spanish  lesson from six to seven, and struggles with the pathetic ignorance of  grown men and women in the night school from eight to half-past nine  or ten.    The Spanish pastor and his wife, also teachers in day school, night  school, Sunday school, are no less marvels of industry. The  multiplication table, lustily intoned to the tramp of marching feet,  called us into a class-room where the older girls were gathered for  lessons in reading and writing, arithmetic and geography, sewing and  embroidery. The delicate little lady who presides over this lively  kingdom may be seen on Sunday, seated at the melodeon, leading the  chapel music--an exquisite picture of a Spanish senora, with the lace  mantilla crowning the black hair and gracefully falling to the slender  shoulders. We had heard her give an address on foreign soil, before an  audience of a hundred strangers, speaking with an irresistible fervor  of appeal, and no less charming was she at the head of her own table,  the soul of vivacious and winsome hospitality.    As for the pastor himself, he carries the administrative burdens of  church and school, teaches the larger boys morning and afternoon, and  the men in the evening, preaches once on Thursday and twice on Sunday,  and slips in between these stated tasks all the innumerable incidental  duties of a missionary pastorate. And yet this man of many labors is  not only Spanish, but Philippine. His childhood was passed at Cavite,  the home of his father, a Spanish officer, who had chosen his bride  from a native family. The boy was put to school with the friars at  Manila, where, rather to the disgust of the soldier-father, he formed  the desire to enter the brotherhood. He was not blind--what students  are?--to the blemishes of his teachers. He had often stood by with the  other lads and shouted with laughter to see a group of friars, their  cassocks well girded up, drive a pig into their shallow pond and stab  the plunging creature there, that it might be counted \"fish\" and serve  them for dinner on Friday. But his faith in the order held firm, and,  when his novitiate was well advanced, he was sent to Madrid for the  final ceremonies. Here, by chance, he dropped into a Protestant  service, and after several years of examination and indecision, chose  the thorny road.      [Illustration: PASAJES]    All his wearing occupations do not dull that fine sense of courtesy  inherent in a Spanish gentleman. The sun itself had hardly risen when  we departed from San Sebastian, "]]]
