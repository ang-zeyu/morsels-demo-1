Kimball's Journal (#2)"],[1,"prayers were continually ascending to the Lord of  sabaoth, that He would prepare the way, and hasten the time when      \"The servants of the Lord    Soon should take their stand,    And spread the glorious light of truth--    Throughout their native land.\"    Notwithstanding this desire, the way was not open for the Elders until  the spring of 1837, when the word of the Lord to the Elders of Israel  was, that they might go forth to the distant nations of the earth, that  the kingdom might roll forth, so that every heart might be penetrated.    Prior to this, my labors had been confined to my own land, in which  I had traveled about six thousand miles, preaching the gospel to the  best of my ability, and had the pleasure of baptizing several of my  countrymen for the remission of sins, and introducing them into the  kingdom which the Lord has set up in these last days.    I had frequently felt a desire to visit the shores of Europe, and  believed that the time was fast approaching when I should take leave of  my own country and lift up my voice to other nations, warning them of  the things which were coming on the earth, and making known to them the  great things which the Lord had brought to pass. Yet it never occurred  to my mind that I should be one of the first commissioned to preach the  everlasting gospel on the shores of Europe, and I can assure my friends  I was taken by surprise when I was informed by Brother Hyrum Smith,  one of the Presidency of the Church, that I had been designed by the  Spirit, and, at a conference of the authorities of the Church which had  been held, was appointed to take the charge of a mission to the kingdom  of Great Britain.    The idea of being appointed to such an important office and mission  was almost more than I could bear up under. I felt my weakness and  unworthiness, and was nearly ready to sink under the task which  devolved upon me, and I could not help exclaiming: \"O Lord I am a man  of 'stammering tongue,' and altogether unfit for such a work. How can  I go to preach in that land, which is so famed throughout Christendom  for light, knowledge and piety, and as the nursery of religion; and to  a people whose intelligence is proverbial?\"    Again, the idea of leaving my family for so long a time, which a  mission to that country must necessarily require--of being separated  from my friends whom I loved, and with whom I had enjoyed many  blessings and happy seasons--of leaving my native land to sojourn among  strangers in a strange land, was almost overwhelming.    However, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of  duty. Neither did I confer with flesh and blood; but the moment I  understood the will of my Heavenly Father, I felt a determination to  go at all hazards, believing that He would support me by His almighty  power, and endow me with every qualification I needed.    Although my family were dear to me, and I should have to leave them  almost destitute, I felt that the cause of truth, the gospel of Christ,  outweighed every other consideration; and I felt willing to leave them,  believing that their wants would be provided for by that God who taketh  care of sparrows and who feedeth the young ravens when they cry.    I was then set apart, along with Elder Hyde, who was likewise appointed  to that mission, by the laying on of the hands of the Presidency, who  agreed that Elders Goodson, Russell, Richards, Fielding and Snider  should accompany us.    After spending a few days in arranging my affairs and settling my  business, on the thirteenth day of June, A. D. 1837, I bade adieu to my  family and friends, and the town of Kirtland, where the house of the  Lord stood, in which I had received my anointing, and had seen such  wonderful displays of the power and glory of God. In company with Elder  Hyde and the other brethren, I arrived at Fairport, on Lake Erie, that  afternoon, a distance of twelve miles; and about an hour after our  arrival, took passage in a steam-boat for Buffalo, New York.    We were accompanied by Brother R. B. Thompson and wife, who were on  their way to Canada, from Kirtland, where he intended to labor in the  ministry.    After a pleasant voyage, we reached Buffalo the next day, at which  place we expected to get some funds which were promised us, to assist  us on our journey, but we were unfortunately disappointed.    At that time we had but very little means, but still we determined to  prosecute our journey, believing that the Lord would open our way.    We accordingly continued our journey, and took our passage in a line  boat on the Erie Canal to Utica, a distance of two hundred and fifty  miles, and thence to Albany on the railroad.    From this latter place I went with Brother Richards into the country  about thirty miles, where we were successful in obtaining some means to  enable us to prosecute our journey. We then returned and took passage  on a steamboat for New York, at which place we arrived on the 22nd day  of June.    On our arrival we met with Brothers Goodson and Snider, according to  appointment (they having gone round by the way of Canada), all in good  health.    When we arrived at New York we found a vessel ready to sail, but not  having sufficient means we were obliged to wait until such time as  we could obtain funds to pay our passage and buy provisions for the  voyage. We rented a small room in a store house, hoping that some  way would be provided for us to go forward and fulfill the mission  whereunto we were sent.    We spent considerable time while we were there in praying to our  Heavenly Father for His guidance and protection, that He would make  our way plain before us, bless us with a prosperous voyage across the  billows of the mighty ocean, and make us a blessing to each other and  to the captain and crew with whom we should sail.    During our stay in that city, we were subject to many inconveniences.  We had to lay upon the floor, and had to buy and cook our own victuals;  yet none of these things moved us, neither did we feel discouraged,  believing that the Lord would open our way and guide us to our  destination.    We conversed with many persons on the subject of the gospel, and  distributed a large number of copies of the \"Prophetic Warning\" among  all classes of the community; not forgetting the ministers of religion  who abound in that city. We sent a copy to every one whose name we  could ascertain through the medium of the post office.    After remaining a few days, we were presented with sixty dollars to  assist us. Brother Elijah Fordham made us a present of ten dollars,  and concluded to accompany us on our mission, but upon more mature  consideration, we thought it was best for him to stop in that place,  believing that the Lord had a people in that city, and that a Church  would be built up, which was afterwards done by the instrumentality of  Elders Parley P. and Orson Pratt.    Having obtained as much money as would pay our passage across the  Atlantic, we laid in a stock of provisions, and on the first day of  July went on board the ship _Garrick_, bound for Liverpool, and weighed  anchor about ten o'clock, a. m., and about four o'clock, p. m. of the  same day, lost sight of my native land. I had feelings which I cannot  describe when I could no longer behold its shores, and when I bade  adieu to the land of my birth, which was fast receding, I felt to  exclaim:      \"Yes, my native land, I love thee:    All thy scenes I love them well:    Friends, connections, happy country,    Can I bid you all farewell?    Can I leave you    Far in distant lands to dwell?\"    However, when I reflected on the causes which had induced me to leave  it for a while, and the work which devolved upon me I could likewise  say,      \"I go, but not to plough the main    To ease a restless mind.\"    No; I hope I was actuated by a different motive than either to please  myself or to gain the riches and applause of the world; it was a  higher consideration than these that induced me to leave my home. It  was because a dispensation of the gospel had been committed to me,  and I felt an ardent desire that my fellow-creatures in other lands,  as well as those of the land of my birth, might hear the sound of the  everlasting gospel, obey its requisitions, rejoice in the fullness and  blessings thereof and escape the judgments which were threatened upon  the ungodly.    Our passage was very agreeable, and the winds for most part very  favorable. On the banks of Newfoundland we saw several whales and many  different species of fish.    We were kindly treated while on board, both by the officers and crew,  and their conduct was indeed praiseworthy; had we been their own  relatives, they could not have behaved more kindly or have treated us  better. Thus the Lord answered our prayers in this respect, for which I  desire to praise His holy name.    The Lord also gave us favor in the eyes of the passengers, who treated  us with the greatest respect. During our voyage a child belonging to  one of the passengers was very sick and was given up for dead by the  doctor who attended it; consequently, its parents had given up all  hopes of its recovery, and expected to have to commit their little  one to the ocean. Feeling a great anxiety for the child, I went to  its parents and reasoned with, and laid before them the principle of  faith, and told them that the Lord was able to restore their child,  notwithstanding there was no earthly prospect of its recovery, to  which they listened with great interest. Having an opportunity shortly  after, secretly to lay hands upon the child, I did so, and in the name  of Jesus Christ rebuked the disease which preyed upon its system. The  Spirit of the Lord attended the administration, and from that time the  child began to recover, and two or three days after it was running  about perfectly well. Its parents had to acknowledge that it was healed  by the power "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4759"],[0,"The Romance of Rubber (#2)"],[1,"fenced in by barbed wire. A cow must be starving that would care  to flavor her luncheon with the needles that the thistle bears.  The common skunk cabbage would make a tempting meal for her after  a winter of dry feeding, had not Nature given it an odor that  disgusts even a spring-time appetite. The milkweed welcomes the  bees and flies that help to distribute her pollen where she wants  it spread, but she has her own way of punishing the useless  thieves that trespass up her stalk. Wherever the hooks of an  insect's feet pierce her tender skin, she pours out a milky juice  to entangle its feet and body, and it is a lucky bug that succeeds  in escaping before this juice hardens, and holds him a prisoner  condemned to die.    All over the world there are plants with the same ability that the  milkweed has, but it is especially true of certain trees and vines  of the tropics. As soon as the little beetle begins to bore into  the bark of one of these trees, there pours out a sticky, milky  fluid that kills the insect at once. If this were all, the wound  would remain open, ready for the next robber who came along. In  order that the break may be healed, a cement is necessary, but not  a hard, unyielding one, for that would crumble away with the  motion of the tree in the wind.    So with Mother Nature's perfection in doing things, the very plant  juice that has done duty as a poison is hardened into an elastic  stopper, with the result that, no matter how far the tree may sway  and tug at the wound, the filling gives and stretches, true to the  task it has to perform.    This was the juice the crafty savage induced the tree to give up.  Wherever the bark was cut, the fluid poured forth to heal the  break and hardened like blood on a cut finger. The native caught  it while it was still soft and applied it to his simple needs.    This juice is not the sap of the rubber tree. Sap, which is the  life-blood of the tree, flows through the wood, but the juice we  are describing is contained in the inner bark, a thin layer  directly below the outer bark.    Scientific men call this juice latex. It is like milk in three  ways: it is white, it contains tiny particles that rise to the top  like cream, and it spoils quickly.    The particles in cow's milk are full of fats which make it good  for us to drink. But a rubber tree's milk has tiny atoms of rubber  and resin and other things, and it took time to discover which of  the vines and trees was the prize milker of the tropics and gave  the largest amount of pure rubber. Finally, the Hevea, the very  tree the Frenchman wrote about, proved to be the best, and,  although by no means the only rubber tree of commercial value, it  is acknowledged the greatest of rubber trees.    The Hevea tree grows sixty feet tall, and when full grown is eight  or ten feet around. It rises as straight as an elm, with high  branching limbs and long, smooth oval leaves. Sprays of pale  flowers blossom upon it in August, followed in a few months by  pods containing three speckled seeds which look like smooth,  slightly flattened nutmegs. When the seeds are ready to drop the  outer covering of the pod bursts with a loud report, the seeds  shooting in all directions.    This is Nature's clever scheme to spread the Hevea family. The  tree grows wild in the hot, damp forests of the Amazon valley and  in other parts of South America that have a similar climate. The  ideal climate for the rubber tree is one which is uniform all the  year round, from eighty-nine to ninety-four degrees at noon, and  riot lower than seventy degrees at night. The Amazon country has a  rainy season which lasts half the year, though the other season is  by no means a dry one, and so for half the time the jungles are  flooded.    These rubber storehouses had been growing for thousands of years  in the Amazon jungle with their wealth securely sealed up in their  bark, the peck of a bird, the boring of a beetle, or the scratch  of a climbing animal being the only draft upon their treasure. The  trees around the mouth of the river supplied whatever was needed  for the little manufacturing that was at first done. But the  discovery that made a universal use for rubber changed all this.  Brazil was surprised to find what great treasure her forests  contained. Large rubber areas were found a thousand miles up the  river and she began in a serious way to develop a large crude  rubber business.    Less than twenty years ago Brazil produced practically all the  rubber used in the world. But to-day she furnishes less than  one-tenth of the world's supply. How Brazil, possessing in her vast  forests millions of rubber trees of the finest quality, has been  forced by unfavorable conditions to permit the Far East to sweep  from her in this short time the crude rubber supremacy of the  world is one of the most unusual chapters in modern industrial  history.          CHAPTER 4    WICKHAM'S IDEA      The story of the success of the East Indies in wresting the crude  rubber supremacy from Brazil, begins with an Englishman named  Wickham, who might be called the father of plantation rubber.    Wickham, who had spent some years in South America, understood the  difficulties of gathering rubber in the jungles. He believed that  if rubber could be cultivated it might prove a good crop on the  coffee plantations in India which a blight had recently rendered  valueless for coffee. What a strange fact it is that this blight  gave Brazil a chance to go into coffee growing, and that while  Brazil was losing the rubber supremacy to the Far East, the Far  East at about the same time was surrendering the leadership in  coffee to Brazil. The latter now holds first place in coffee  growing as firmly as does the Far East in rubber growing.    Wickham saw that there were difficulties that would prevent the  gathering of wild rubber from keeping pace with the growing  demand. Although millions of rubber trees still stood untouched in  the Brazilian forests, only those trees near the river banks could  be tapped because of the impossibility of getting the rubber out  of the dense vegetation. Life in the jungle was dangerous and  lonely, and therefore rubber gatherers were not easy to find. They  were compelled to work far from their families and friends, and in  constant danger from wild beasts, reptiles and death-bearing  fevers. It is no wonder that rubber obtained in this way came to  be known as \"wild rubber.\" Moreover, transporting the crude  product through the jungles was hard and expensive and the rubber  obtained under these conditions was not always so clean or high in  quality as might be wished.    \"If rubber trees grow from the seeds which nature scatters in the  jungle,\" said Wickham to himself, \"why should they not grow from  seeds put into the ground by hand?\"    \"If rubber trees could be raised from seed, they could be planted  in the open in rows where they could easily be tended and tapped,  and the rubber gathered quickly and safely. Instead of having to  brave the dangerous jungles, men could plant and cultivate rubber  in spots of their own choosing so long as they chose places where  the climate was right.\"    For many years people only laughed at Wickham's great idea, but  like Goodyear he had faith enough to persevere. While in Brazil he  planted some rubber seeds to see what would happen. The seeds DID  grow, and the book which Wickham wrote about his idea and his  experiments finally came into the hands of Sir Joseph Hooker, the  Director of the Botanical Gardens in Kew, near London. So  interested did he become that he called Wickham's plan to the  attention of the Government of India, and finally Wickham was  commissioned to take a cargo of rubber seeds to England, so that  his idea might be tried out.    This commission was more difficult than one might think, and all  of Wickham's faith and perseverance were needed to carry it out.  Indeed for a time it seemed hopeless, principally because the  seeds so quickly dry up and lose their vitality that they must be  planted very soon after being gathered.    But Wickham watched his opportunity, and finally he was able to  charter a ship in the name of the Indian Government. About a third  of the way up the Amazon River he placed in her hold several  thousand carefully packed seeds of the Hevea Braziliensis, or  rubber tree. Let Wickham, himself, tell how he surmounted the next  difficulty:    \"We were bound to call in at the city of Para as the port of  entry, in order to obtain clearance papers for the ship before we  could go to sea. Any delay would have rendered my precious freight  quite valueless and useless. But again fortune favored. I had a  'friend at court' in the person of Consul Green, who went himself  with me to call on the proper official, and supported me as I  presented to His Excellency 'my difficulty and anxiety, being in  charge of, and having on board a ship anchored out in the stream,  exceedingly delicate botanical specimens, especially designated  for delivery to Her Britannic Majesty's own Royal Garden of Kew.  Even while doing myself the honor of thus calling on His  Excellency, I had given orders to the captain of the ship to keep  up steam, having ventured to trust His Excellency would see his  way clear to furnishing me with immediate dispatch. An interview  most polite, full of mutual compliments in the best Portuguese  manner, enabled us to get under way as soon as the captain had got  the dinghy hauled aboard.\"    Can you imagine Wickham's sigh of relief as his vessel, with its  freight of perishable treasure, steamed out of port, and began the  long journey to England?          CHAPTER 5    PLANTATION DEVELOPMENT      The transporting of the rubber seeds from the Brazilian forests to  England was only the first step in Wickham's project. The real  test was still to come. The seeds were planted in the famous  Botanical Gardens of Kew, and on"]]]
