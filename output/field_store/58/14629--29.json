NOTE. All measurements are in inches and tenths, and a        variation of about ten per cent. from the figures given may be        expected. The number before the name of each species is that of        the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North        American Birds.'          INTRODUCTION      HOW TO LEARN A BIRD'S NAME    \"How can I learn to know the birds?\" is the first question of the  seeker after bird-lore. The scientist's reply, \"By shooting them and  studying their structure and markings in detail,\" may do for the few  who, like himself, desire to know the birds scientifically; but it is  emphatically not the answer to give the ninety and nine who, while  they desire to secure an intimate, accurate knowledge of birds, will  not gain it at the sacrifice of bird-life.    In the present volume, therefore, an attempt has been made so to  group, figure, and describe our birds that any species may be named  which has been _definitely seen_. The birds are kept in their  systematic Orders, a natural arrangement, readily comprehended, but,  further than this, accepted classifications have been abandoned and  the birds have been grouped according to color and markings.    A key to the Orders gives the more prominent characters on which they  are based; telling for example, the external differences between a  Duck and a Grebe. In comparatively few instances, however, will the  beginner have much difficulty in deciding to what Order a bird  belongs. Probably eight times, out of ten the unknown bird will belong  to the Order Passeres, or Perching Birds, when one has only to select  the color section in which it should be placed, choose from among the  colored figures the bird whose identity is sought, and verify one's  selection by reading the description of the bird's characteristics and  the outline of its range.    In the case of closely related species, and particularly subspecies,  the subjects of range and season are of the utmost importance. Most  subspecies resemble their nearest allies too closely to be identified  in life by color alone, and in such cases a bird's name is to be  learned by its color in connection with its distribution and the  season in which it is seen.    During the breeding period, unless one chance to be in a region where  two races intergrade, subspecific names may be applied to the bird in  nature with some certainty, for it is a law that only one subspecies  of a species can nest in the same area; but during migrations and in  the winter, when several subspecies of one species may be found  associated, it is frequently impossible to name them with accuracy.    For example, during the summer one need have no hesitancy in calling  the Robins of the lowlands of South Carolina the Southern Robin  (_Planesticus migratorius achrusterus_) but later, when the Northern  Robins (_Planesticus migratorius migratorius_) begin to appear, it  would be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish them in life  from the resident birds.    If it were possible to impress the student, who proposes to name the  bird in the bush, with the _absolute necessity_ for careful, definite  observation he would be saved many disappointing and discouraging  experiences.    It is not possible to examine your bird too thoroughly. Never be  satisfied with a superficial view and a general impression. Look at  your bird, if you can, from several points of view; study its  appearance in detail, its size, bill, crown, back, tail, wings,  throat, breast, etc., and AT ONCE enter what you see in a note-book  kept for that purpose. In this way, and this way alone, can you expect  to compete with those who use the gun.    It does not follow, however, that because one does not collect  specimens of birds one cannot study them scientifically. While the  student may not be interested in the classification of birds purely  from the standpoint of the systematist, he is strongly urged to  acquaint himself with at least the arrangement of the Orders and  Families of our birds and their leading structural characters.    To the student who desires to prepare himself for his work afield such  a study may well come before he attempts to name the birds. But where  the chief end in view is to learn a bird's name, the more technical  side of the subject may be deferred. In any event, it should not be  neglected. This orderly arrangement of knowledge will not only be  practical benefit in one's future labors but it will bring with it  that sense of satisfaction which accompanies the assurance that we  know what we know.    As one learns to recognize bird after bird it is an admirable plan to  classify systematically one's list of bird acquaintances under their  proper Orders and Families. These may be learned at once from the  systematic table at the end of the book, where the numbers which  precede each species are arranged serially, and hence systematically.    In some instances, as an aid to identification in the field,  descriptions of birds' notes have been included. It is not supposed  that these descriptions will convey an adequate idea of a bird's song  to a person who has never heard it, but it is hoped that they may  occasionally lead to the recognition of calls or songs when they are  heard.    An adequate method of transcribing bird's notes has as yet to be  devised and the author realizes only too well how unsatisfactory the  data here presented will appear to the student. It is hoped, however,  that they may sometimes prove of assistance in naming birds in life.    As has been said before, the aim of this volume is to help students to  learn the names of our birds in their haunts. But we should be doing  scant justice to the possibilities of bird study if, even by silence,  we should imply that they ended with the learning to know the bird.  This is only the beginning of the quest which may bring us into close  intimacy with the secrets of nature. The birds' haunts and food, their  seasons and times of coming and going; their songs and habits during  courtship, their nest-building, egg-laying, incubating and care of  their young, these and a hundred other subjects connected with their  lives may claim our attention and by increasing our knowledge of  bird-life, add to our love of birds.      HOW BIRDS ARE NAMED    Birds have two kinds of names. One is a common, vernacular, or popular  name; the other is a technical or scientific name. The first is  usually given to the living bird by the people of the country it  inhabits. The second is applied to specimens of birds by  ornithologists who classify them.    Common names in their origin and use know no law. Technical names are  bestowed under the system of nomenclature established by LinnA|us and  their formation and application are governed by certain definite,  generally accepted rules. The LinnA|an system, as it is now employed by  most American ornithologists, provides that a bird, in addition to  being grouped in a certain Class, Order, Family, etc., shall have a  generic and specific name which, together, shall not be applied to  any other animal.    Our Robin, therefore, is classified and named as follows:      CLASS AVES,      ORDER PASSERES, Perching Birds.      Suborder _Oscines_, Singing Perching Birds.      Family _TurdidA|_ Thrushes.      Subfamily _TurdinA|_ Thrushes.      Genus, _Planesticus_, Thrushes.      Species, _migratorius_ American Robin.    The Robin's distinctive scientific name, therefore, which it alone  possesses, is _Planesticus migratorius_. There are numerous other  members of the genus _Planesticus_, but not one of them is called  _migratorius_ and this combination of names, therefore, applied to  only one bird.    The questions Why use all these Latin terms? Why not call the bird  \"Robin\" and be done with it? are easily answered. Widely distributed  birds frequently have different names in different parts of their  range. The Flicker (_Colaptes auratus_), for instance, has over one  hundred common or vernacular names. Again, the same name is often  applied to wholly different birds. Our Robin (_Planesticus  migratorius_) is not even a member of the same family as the European  Robin (_Erithacus rubecola_.) If, therefore, we should write of birds  or attempt to classify them only by their common names, we should be  dealing with such unfixed quantities that the result would be  inaccurate and misleading. But by using one name in a language known  to educated people of all countries, a writer may indicate, without  danger of being misunderstood, the particular animal to which he  refers. Among people speaking the same tongue, where a definite list  of vernacular names of animals has been established, they can of  course be used instead of the scientific names.    Such a list of North American birds has been prepared by the American  Ornithologists' Union. It furnishes a common as well as scientific  name for each of our birds, and is the recognized standard of  nomenclature among American ornithologists. The names and numbers of  birds employed in this Color Key are those of the American  Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North American Birds.'    It will be observed that in this 'Check-List,' and consequently in the  following pages, many birds have three scientific names, a generic,  specific, and subspecific. The Western Robin, for example, appears as  _Planesticus migratorius propinquus_. What is the significance of this  third name?    In the days of LinnA|us, and for many years after, it was supposed that  a species was a distinct creation whose characters never varied. But  in comparatively recent years, as specimens have been gathered from  throughout the country inhabited by a species, comparison frequently  shows that specimens from one part of its range differ from those  taken in another part of its range.

That this interest is not merely confined to a few scientific  men, but is shared by the general public, is shown by the numerous  articles, including many telegrams, in the columns of the daily papers.  The object of this book is to tell some of the interesting facts  concerning a few of the better known or more remarkable of these extinct  inhabitants of the ancient world; also, if possible, to ease the strain  on these venerable animals, caused by stretching them so often beyond  their due proportions._    _The book is admittedly somewhat on the lines of Mr. Hutchinson's  \"Extinct Monsters\" and \"Creatures of Other Days,\" but it is hoped that  it may be considered with books as with boats, a good plan to build  after a good model. The information scattered through these pages has  been derived from varied sources; some has of necessity been taken from  standard books, a part has been gathered in the course of museum work  and official correspondence; for much, the author is indebted to his  personal friends, and for a part, he is under obligations to friends he  has never met, who have kindly responded to his inquiries. The endeavor  has been conscientiously made to exclude all misinformation; it is,  nevertheless, entirely probable that some mistakes may have crept in,  and due apology for these is hereby made beforehand._    _The author expects to be taken to task for the use of scientific names,  and the reader may perhaps sympathize with the old lady who said that  the discovery of all these strange animals did not surprise her so much  as the fact that anyone should know their names when they were found.  The real trouble is that there are no common names for these animals.  Then, too, people who call for easier names do not stop to reflect  that, in many cases, the scientific names are no harder than others,  simply less familiar, and, when domesticated, they cease to be hard:  witness mammoth, elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, boa constrictor, all of  which are scientific names. And if, for example, we were to call the  Hyracotherium a Hyrax beast it would not be a name, but a description,  and not a bit more intelligible._    _Again, it is impossible to indicate the period at which these creatures  lived without using the scientific term for it--Jurassic, Eocene,  Pliocene, as the case may be--because there is no other way of doing  it._    _Some readers will doubtless feel disappointed because they are not told  how many years ago these animals lived. The question is often asked--How  long ago did this or that animal live? But when the least estimate puts  the age of the earth at only 10,000,000 years, while the longest makes  it 6,000,000,000, it does seem as if it were hardly worth while to name  any figures. Even when we get well toward the present period we find the  time that has elapsed since the beginning of the Jurassic, when the  Dinosaurs held carnival, variously put at from 15,000,000 to 6,000,000  years; while from the beginning of the Eocene, when the mammals began to  gain the supremacy, until now, the figures vary from 3,000,000 to  5,000,000 years. So the question of age will be left for the reader to  settle to his or her satisfaction._    _The restorations of extinct animals may be considered as giving as  accurate representations of these creatures as it is possible to make;  they were either drawn by Mr. Knight, whose name is guarantee that they  are of the highest quality, or by Mr. Gleeson, with the aid of Mr.  Knight's criticism. That they are infallibly correct is out of the  question; for, as Dr. Woodward writes in the preface to \"Extinct  Monsters,\" \"restorations are ever liable to emendation, and the present  ... will certainly prove no exception to the rule.\" As a striking  instance of this, it was found necessary at the last moment to change  the figure of Hesperornis, the original life-like portrait proving to be  incorrect in attitude, a fact that would have long escaped detection but  for the Pan-American Exposition. The connection between the two is  explained on page 76. However, the reader may rest assured that these  restorations are infinitely more nearly correct than many figures of  living animals that have appeared within the last twenty-five years, and  are even now doing duty._    _The endeavor has been made to indicate, at the end of each chapter, the  museums in which the best examples of the animals described may be seen,  and also some book or article in which further information may be  obtained. As this book is intended for the general reader, references to  purely technical articles have, so far as possible, been avoided, and  none in foreign languages mentioned._    _For important works of reference on the subject of paleontology, the  reader may consult \"A Manual of Paleontology,\" by Alleyne Nicholson and  R. Lydekker, a work in two volumes dealing with invertebrates,  vertebrates, and plants, or \"A Text-Book of Paleontology,\" by Karl von  Zittel, English edition, only the first volume of which has so far been  published. An admirable book on the vertebrates is \"Outlines of  Vertebrate Paleontology,\" by Arthur Smith Woodward. It is to be  understood that these are not at all \"popular\" in their scope, but  intended for students who are already well advanced in the study of  zooelogy._          ANIMALS OF THE PAST I    FOSSILS, AND HOW THEY ARE FORMED        \"_How of a thousand snakes each one      Was changed into a coil of stone._\"      Fossils are the remains, or even the indications, of animals and plants  that have, through natural agencies, been buried in the earth and  preserved for long periods of time. This may seem a rather meagre  definition, but it is a difficult matter to frame one that will be at  once brief, exact, and comprehensive; fossils are not necessarily the  remains of extinct animals or plants, neither are they, of necessity,  objects that have become petrified or turned into stone.    Bones of the Great Auk and Rytina, which are quite extinct, would hardly  be considered as fossils; while the bones of many species of animals,  still living, would properly come in that category, having long ago been  buried by natural causes and often been changed into stone. And yet it  is not essential for a specimen to have had its animal matter replaced  by some mineral in order that it may be classed as a fossil, for the  Siberian Mammoths, found entombed in ice, are very properly spoken of as  fossils, although the flesh of at least one of these animals was so  fresh that it was eaten. Likewise the mammoth tusks brought to market  are termed fossil-ivory, although differing but little from the tusks of"]]]
