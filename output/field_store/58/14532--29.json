Mamm., 6:55,    February 9, 1925. (Type from St. Michael, Alaska.)    _Specimens examined._--Two from _Alaska_: 1 mi. NE Anchorage, 100 ft.    _Remarks._--Both specimens of this pale subspecies were trapped, along  with six _Clethrionomys_ and one _Mus_, in a grassy area bordered on  one side by the road and on the other by a spruce forest. No. 21069,  [male]?, taken on August 21, is in molt, with one patch of new fur on  the rump and another along the midline of the nape and shoulders.

N  Kinuso, 2.    _Remarks._--Some of the shrews taken in extreme southwestern Yukon  Territory (11/2 miles south and 3 miles east of Dalton Post) and in  extreme northwestern British Columbia (Stonehouse Creek and Mt. Glave)  show evidence of intergradation with the coastal subspecies, _S. o.  alascensis_, in length of hind foot. These individuals have a long  hind foot (14 and 15); the hind feet of specimens from the other  localities listed measure 13 and 14.    Alcorn, like Rand (1944:35), found the dusky shrew to be less common  than the cinereous shrew; both were taken in the same trap lines. The  dusky shrew was taken at a higher altitude (4000 feet, on Mt. Glave)  than the cinereous shrew.

Stonehouse Creek and  Kelsall River, 2.    _Remarks._--Those males with worn teeth seem to have a slightly longer  and deeper rostrum with a larger, more inflated cranium than specimens  of _S. p. navigator_ from Washington, but in other ways resemble  typical _S. p. navigator_. An adult male, with slightly worn teeth,  from Dezadeash Lake has sagittal and lambdoidal crests. All of the  water shrews were taken in July and early August and at the edge of  water in traps baited with rolled oats. None of the females had  embryos.

The paper was loose  and had buckled in numerous places allowing room for the bats to  ensconce themselves between the paper and outside wall.      Myotis lucifugus alascensis Miller    Little Brown Bat        _Myotis lucifugus alascensis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:63,    October 16, 1897. (Type from Sitka, Alaska.)    _Specimens examined._--One from _British Columbia_: Screw Creek,  10 mi. S and 50 mi. E Teslin.    _Remarks._--The specimen is considerably darker both above and below  than either of two specimens of _M. l. alascensis_ from Red Bluff Bay,  Alaska. Alcorn searched ten frame buildings in an abandoned camp on  the east side of Screw Creek, for bats and found only the one bat. It  was above some droppings. No droppings were found in other buildings.      Ochotona collaris (Nelson)    Collared Pika        _Lagomys collaris_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 8:117,    December 21, 1893. (Type from near head of Tanana River, about    200 miles south of Fort Yukon, Alaska.)        [_Ochotona_] _collaris_ Trouessart, Catal. Mamm. viv. foss.,    p. 648, 1897.    _Specimens examined._--Total 14, as follows: _British Columbia_:  Stonehouse Creek, 51/2 mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River,  1; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 13.    _Remarks._--In comparing specimens obtained by Alcorn with published  descriptions of _O. collaris_ in Howell (1924:35), it appeared that  measurable geographic variation might be present in this monotypic  species. Accordingly, comparisons were made with materials in the  Biological Surveys collection of the U. S. National Museum, the  Provincial Museum, Victoria, B. C., and the National Museum of Canada.  A comparison of specimens of similar ages showed that no subspecific  separation is justified although animals from the Yukon Territory,  British Columbia, and Northwest Territories, as compared with  available material from Alaska, tend to be grayer in color and longer  in total length with a slightly larger skull and greater alveolar  length of molariform tooth-row in both upper and lower jaws.    Specimens used for comparison were from the following localities:  _Alaska_: Mts. near Eagle (USBS), 15; 200 mi. S Fort Yukon (USBS), 2;  Upper Little Delta River, Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1;  Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 3; Little Delta River, Slate  Creek, Red Mt. Camp, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1; Muldron Glacier, Mt.  McKinley (USBS), 2; Mt. McKinley (USBS), 3; Summit of Chugach Mts., on  Richardson Highway, N of Valdez (USBS), 1; Chitina River Glacier (Nat.  Mus. Canada), 3. _Yukon Territory_: McMillan Pass, Canol Road, mile  282 (Nat.

(Type from Fort Anderson, near mouth of    Anderson River, Mackenzie, Canada.)    _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: W side  Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 1; 5 mi. W Teslin River,  2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 53 mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 14  mi. N Fort Halkett, W side Smith River, 1.    _Remarks._--Alcorn reports seeing few hares on his two trips to  Alaska. Near the Miniker River, a geologist told him that the numbers  of these animals had steadily declined since 1943. One of three seen  in a spruce forest on July 8, 1947, near Whitehorse was taken by  Alcorn. A young one was captured in a rat trap in a building near the  Teslin River on July 5 of the same year.      Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis A. H. Howell    Red Squirrel        _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol.    Soc. Washington, 49:135, August 22, 1936. (Type from Raspberry    Creek, about 30 mi. SE of Telegraph Creek, northern British Columbia.)    _Specimens examined._--Total 18, as follows: _Yukon Territory_:  McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; W side Lewes River,  2150 ft., 2 mi. SW Whitehorse, 1; 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16  mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct.

W Fort Nelson, 8.    _Remarks._--Rand (1944:42) experienced difficulty in assigning  subspecific names to red squirrels taken along the Alaska Highway in  northern British Columbia. Some variability as found by Rand is noted  in adults taken by Alcorn in this area. All of the specimens assigned  to _T. h. columbiensis_ have a darker tail and more tawny feet than  _T. h. preblei_. The average of skulls of adults is smaller than the  skull of an adult of _T. h. preblei_ from Yerrick Creek, Alaska.    Alcorn obtained most of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],[0,"The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#2)"],[1," think, will be found  valuable, of some apparatus that has been introduced, chiefly during  recent years, for experimenting upon gases under reduced pressure,  _e.g._ vacuum taps and joints. Finally, in Chapter V., there is a short  account of the methods of graduating and calibrating glass apparatus for  use in quantitative experiments.      =The Working-place.=--The blow-pipe must be placed in a position  perfectly free from draughts. It should not face a window, nor be in  too strong a light, if that can be avoided, for a strong light will  render the non-luminous flames, which are used in glass-blowing, almost  invisible, and seriously inconvenience the operator, who cannot apply  the various parts of the flames to his glass with the degree of  certainty that is necessary; neither can he perceive the condition of  the glass so correctly in a strong light, for though in many operations  the glass-worker is guided by feeling rather than by seeing, yet sight  plays a very important part in his proceedings.    My own blow-pipe is placed near a window glazed with opaque glass, which  looks southwards, but is faced by buildings at a short distance. In dull  weather the light obtained is good; but on most days I find it  advantageous to shade the lower half of the window with a green baize  screen. Some glass-blowers prefer gaslight to daylight.    The form of the table used is unimportant, provided that it is of a  convenient height, and allows free play to the foot which works the  blower underneath it. The blower should be _fixed_ in a convenient  position, or it will get out of control at critical moments. The table,  or that part of it which surrounds the blow-pipe, should be covered with  sheet-iron to protect it from the action of the fragments of hot glass  that will fall upon it. The tubes that supply air and gas to the  blow-pipe should come from beneath the table, and may pass through holes  cut for the purpose.    Many glass-blowers prefer to work at a rather high table, and sit on a  rather high stool, so that they are well above their work. No doubt this  gives extra command over the work in hand, which is often valuable. On  the other hand, it is somewhat fatiguing. For a long spell of labour at  work which is not of a novel character nor specially difficult, I am  disposed to recommend sitting on a chair or low stool, at a table of  such height as will enable the elbows to rest easily upon it whilst the  glass is held in the flame. The precise heights that are desirable for  the table and stool, and the exact position of the blow-pipe, will  depend upon the height and length of arm of the individual workman, and  it must therefore be left to each person to select that which suits him  best. A moveable rest made of wood, for supporting the remote end of a  long piece of glass tube a few inches above the table, whilst the other  end is being heated in the flame, will be found convenient.      =The Blow-pipe.=--Formerly a lamp, in which sweet oil or tallow was  burnt, was employed for glass-working, and such lamps are still  occasionally used. Thus, lamps burning oil or tallow were used on board  the _Challenger_ for hermetically sealing up flasks of water collected  at various depths to preserve them for subsequent examination. I shall  not, however, give an account of such a lamp, for the gas apparatus is  so much more convenient for most purposes that it has now practically  superseded the oil lamps. Fig. 1 shows a gas blow-pipe of exceedingly  simple construction, which can be easily made, and with which good work  can be done.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The tube _A_ is of brass, and has a side tube _B_ brazed to it, ten to  twelve centimetres from the end _E_, according to the dimensions of the  tube. A tube of glass, _EC_, is fitted into _A_ by a cork at _D_. _B_  is connected to a supply of gas by a flexible tube, _C_ is similarly  connected to the blower. By means of _CE_ a stream of air can be forced  into gas burning at the mouth of the blow-pipe _G_, and various flames,  with the characters described in a later section, can be produced with  this instrument. For producing the pointed flame (Fig. 3, p. 9) the  opening _E_ of the air-tube should be contracted to the size of a large  knitting needle. For producing a flame of large size, rich in air (Fig.  4, p. 9), the internal diameter of _E_ may be nearly half as great as  that of _A_ without disadvantage.    This blow-pipe may be fixed in position by the spike _F_, which will fit  into holes in a block of wood or a large cork. Several of these holes in  various positions should be made in the block, so that the position of  the blow-pipe may be varied easily. Two taps must be provided in  convenient positions near the edge of the table to enable the workman to  regulate the supplies of air and gas. These taps should be fixed to the  table and be connected with the gas and air supplies respectively on one  side, and with the blow-pipe on the other, by flexible tubes. If  blow-pipes of this kind be used, at least two of them should be  provided; one of small dimensions for working on small tubes and joints,  the other of larger size for operations on larger tubes. It will be  convenient to have both of them ready for use at all times, as it is  sometimes necessary to employ large and small flames on the same piece  of work in rapid succession. By having several air-tubes of different  sizes fitted to each blow-pipe, a greater variety of work may be done.    For the larger blow-pipe, the internal diameter of _A_ may be fifteen to  seventeen millimetres.    For the smaller instrument, eleven millimetres for the diameter of _A_  would be a useful size.    When a slightly greater outlay can be afforded it will be most  convenient to purchase the blow-pipe. They can be obtained of compact  form, supported on stands with universal joints giving great freedom of  movement, and with taps for regulating the supplies of gas and air, at  comparatively small cost.    As figures of various blow-pipes can be seen in the price-lists of most  dealers in apparatus, they are not given here. Their introduction would  be of but little service, for the construction of that which is adopted  can be readily ascertained by taking it to pieces. The simplest  blow-pipe usually used for glass-working is that of Herapath. This has  two taps to regulate the air and gas supplies respectively, and will  give a considerable variety of flames, which will be discussed  subsequently.    An excellent blow-pipe, made on the same principle as that shown in Fig.  1, but more substantially and with interchangeable jets, can be obtained  from Messrs. Muller of Holborn for a moderate outlay.    Another very good blow-pipe is the Automaton blow-pipe of Mr. Fletcher  of Warrington. In this, one tap regulates the supply both of air and  gas, which is a great gain when difficult work is in hand. Automaton  blow-pipes are made of two sizes. I have found that the larger size,  with a powerful bellows, heats large pieces of lead glass very  satisfactorily. On the other hand, the fine-pointed oxidising flame of  the Herapath blow-pipe is, perhaps, the most suitable for working joints  of lead glass. Therefore a good equipment would be a small Herapath  blow-pipe and a large-sized Automaton. If only one blow-pipe is  purchased it should be either a medium-sized Herapath, or the smaller  Automaton, as those are most useful for general work.    Mr. Fletcher also makes an ingenious combination of two blow-pipes in  which the gas and air supplies are regulated by a single lever-handle.  This is very convenient, and gives flames that answer well with tubes  made of soft soda glass, and it is very useful for general work. For use  with lead glass the supply of air is rather too small, and does not  enable one to get such good results. This can be easily amended,  however. By slightly increasing the size of the air-tube of the smaller  blow-pipe, and having increased the supply of air to the larger  blow-pipe also, by reducing the external diameter of the end of the  innermost tube, I now get medium-sized brush flames and pointed flames  with this blow-pipe, that are equal to any I have used for heating lead  glass.    For small laboratories the inexpensive No. 5 Bunsen burner of Mr.  Fletcher, which is convertible into a blow-pipe, will be very useful.    Jets of several sizes to fit the air-tubes of blow-pipes may be obtained  with them, and will serve for regulating the supply of air to the flame.      =The Bellows.=--The usual blowing apparatus is some form of foot-blower.  These may be obtained fitted to small tables with sheet-iron tops. But a  much less expensive apparatus is the large foot-blower made by Mr.  Fletcher of Warrington, which can be used at an ordinary table or  laboratory bench. Good foot-blowers can also be obtained from makers of  furnace bellows.    No part of the glass-blower's equipment exceeds the bellows in  importance. The best blower procurable should therefore be adopted. A  bellows which, when used with a large blow-pipe, will not enable you to  heat large pieces of lead glass tube to redness without blackening the  glass when the directions for heating lead glass on pages 17-21 are  followed, should on no account be received. I am told that at some  places, where the water-supply is at very high pressure, it is utilised  for working blow-pipes by means of the apparatus described below, and  that some glass-workers find it advantageous to use such automatic  blowers. But after a little practice, the effort of working the blower  with the foot whilst manipulating the glass is not a source of serious  inconvenience. Indeed, as it gives a certain degree of control over the  flame without the use of the hands, the foot-blower is preferable. It is  worth while to describe an automatic blower, however.      =Automatic Blower= (Fig. 2).--A strong glass tube _A_ is"]]]
