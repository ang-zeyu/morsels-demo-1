He was proud (but in  the right way), very honest, always straightforward and independent.  But, like his mother, he was warm-hearted and as true as could be. There  was nothing in his nature that was mean, or cruel, or wrong in any way.  He took pride in his talent and worked hard to perfect himself in it.    Here is what Beethoven's handwriting looked like.                              [Illustration: No. 9                            BEETHOVEN'S HANDWRITING]    Bit by bit, the great power of Beethoven as a pianist became known. He  played much among his friends, but he did not like to perform in public.    A story is told that once he was to play his C major Concerto at a  concert. When he arrived at the hall he found the piano was tuned so low  that he had to play the Concerto in C# major.    You know how hard it is to transpose a simple piece, but think of  transposing a Concerto and playing it with orchestra without time for  practice!    Do you sometimes wonder what the great composer looked like? Beethoven  lived outside of Vienna and often took long walks in the country. Once a  little boy ten years of age was taken by his father to visit Beethoven.  The boy must have been a very observant boy for he wrote out a  description of how Beethoven looked. This is the little boy's picture as  a man:                                 [Illustration: No. 10                                      CARL CZERNY]    And this is the description he gave of Beethoven.    \"Beethoven was dressed in a dark gray jacket and trousers of some  long-haired material, which reminded me of the description of Robinson  Crusoe I had just been reading. The jet-black hair stood upright on his  head. A beard, unshaven for several days, made still darker his  naturally swarthy face. I noticed also, with a child's quick perception,  that he had cotton wool which seemed to have been dipped in some yellow  fluid in both ears. His hands were covered with hair, and the fingers  were very broad, especially at the tips.\"    You know, of course, that when we think of music we think of _hearing_  it. We think how it _sounds_ to us. A lover of music loves to hear its  _tones_ and to feel its _rhythm_.    Like every other human being, Beethoven loved music in just this way. He  loved its sounds as they fell on the ear. As colors delight our eyes, so  tones fell with delight upon the ears of this man.    Beethoven was once invited to play at the home of a nobleman, but upon  being informed that he would be expected to go as a menial, he  indignantly rejected the proposal.                             [Illustration: No. 11                              THE ANGRY BEETHOVEN]    Beethoven had many friends and was fond of them. They knew that he was a  genius and were glad to forget some of the very strange things that he  did when he got angry. Here is a picture of the great master seated  among a group of his friends. Although Beethoven was odd, his friends  loved him.                             [Illustration: No. 12                       BEETHOVEN PLAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS]    But a strange Fate touched him and took away his sense of hearing. From  the time he was about thirty years old his hearing grew gradually worse.  Indeed it was necessary for him to have a piano especially constructed  with additional wires so that he could hear.                             [Illustration: No. 13                               BEETHOVEN'S PIANO]    Can you think of anything more cruel, more terrible, more depressing,  more awful?                             [Illustration: No. 14                           BEETHOVEN IN THE COUNTRY]    And yet he went on day, after day, composing beautiful music as he  walked the fields, or as he sat at his table. For we must remember that  he could hear his own music in his thoughts. That is, the mind that made  the music could hear it, though the ear itself was forever closed to the  sound of it.    Year after year he continued to write symphonies and concertos, sonatas,  songs, choral and chamber music.    And year after year the poor ears closed a little more and still a  little more, until finally not even the loudest noises could penetrate  them.    And yet he worked bravely; writing every beautiful music thought that  came to him, so that the world, and that means you and all of us, might  have them. When Beethoven was dying in 1827, Schubert called upon him  and remained with him for some time.

It is true, too, that we have  bright birds that have no excellence in song; but it is also true  that, in this favored land, there is a far greater proportion than  usual of fine song-birds.    The first generations of Australians were not taught to love  Australian things. We \"learned from our wistful mothers to call Old  England home.\" Our school books and our story books were made in Great  Britain for British boys and girls, and naturally they stressed what  was of interest to these boys and girls. We read much about the beauty  of the songs of the Lark, and the Thrush, and the Nightingale, but we  found no printed authority for the belief that our Magpie is one of  the great song-birds of the world; we read of the wonderful powers  of the American Mocking-Bird, and did not know that our beautiful  Lyrebird is a finer mimic; we learned by heart Barry Cornwall's  well-known poem on \"The Storm Petrel,\" and did not know that one of  the most interesting of Petrel rookeries is near the harbor gate  of Melbourne; and I remember well a lesson I heard as a boy on the  migration of birds, in which the teacher took all of his illustrations  from his boyish experiences in the South of England, and gave us no  idea that the annual migration of our familiar Australian birds to  far-off Siberia is a much more wonderful thing.    But all this is being rapidly changed. In the elementary schools  Nature-study is steadily improving, and children are being given an  eye for, and an interest in, the world of Nature around them. Our  school books are now written from the Australian standpoint, and more  use can, therefore, be made of the child's everyday experience. Field  Naturalists' clubs are doing much to extend the area of specialized  Nature-study, and their members are giving valuable assistance to the  schools by taking part in the programs for Arbor Day, Bird Day, and  the like. The growing interest in the Australian fauna and flora  is further evidenced by the frequent reservations by Government of  desirable areas as national parks and sanctuaries for the preservation  of Australian types. Last, but not least, is the production by capable  Nature students of special books on some form of Nature-study, such as  this Bird Book by Mr. Leach.    To our parents, Australia was a stranger land, and they were  sojourners here. Though they lived here, they did not get close enough  to it to appreciate fully its natural beauty and its charm. To us,  and especially to our children, children of Australian-born parents,  children whose bones were made in Australia, the place is home. To  them Nature makes a direct appeal, strengthened by those most powerful  of all associations, those gathered in childhood, when the foundations  of their minds were laid. The English boy, out on a breezy down, may  feel an exaltation of soul on hearing a Skylark raining down a flood  of delicious melody from far up at heaven's gate, but his joy is no  whit greater than his who hears, in the dewy freshness of the early  morning, the carol of the Magpie ringing out over an Australian plain.  To those who live in countries where the winter is long and bitter,  any sign that the genial time of flowers is at hand is very welcome.  All over the countryside the first call of the Cuckoo, spring's  harbinger, arouses the keenest delight in expectant listeners. This  delight is, however, more than mere delight in the bird's song. And to  those brought up with it year by year there comes a time when the call  of the Cuckoo stirs something deep down below the surface of ordinary  emotion. It is the resultant of multitudes of childhood experiences  and of associations with song and story. I first heard the Cuckoo in  Epping Forest one delicious May evening four years ago. It charmed me,  but my delight was almost wholly that of association. All the English  poetry I knew was at the back of the bird's song. Here in Australia  we have no sharply-defined seasons, yet I find myself every spring  listening eagerly for the first plaintive, insistent call of the  Pallid Cuckoo. For me his song marks another milestone passed.    Marcus Clarke wrote of the Laughing Jackasses as bursting into  \"horrible peals of semi-human laughter.\" But then Marcus Clarke was  English-bred, and did not come to Australia till he was eighteen years  old. It makes all the difference in our appreciation of bird or tree  or flower to have known it as a boy. I venture to think no latter-day  Australian who has grown up with our Kookaburra can have any but  the kindliest of feelings for this feathered comedian. For myself, I  confess that I find his laughter infectious, and innumerable times he  has provoked me into an outburst as hearty and as mirthful as his own.  More than half of our pleasure is due to the fact that the bird is      \"The same that in my schoolboy days I listened to.\"    and to such a one we can say--      \"I can listen to thee yet,      Can lie upon the plain    And listen, till I do beget      That golden time again.\"    It is time that we Australians fought against the generally received  opinion that the dominant note of our scenery is weird melancholy.  This is the note sounded mainly by those who were bred elsewhere, who  came to us with other associations and other traditions, and sojourned  among us. It will not be the opinion of the native-born when they find  appropriate speech.      \"Whence doth the mournful keynote start?    From the pure depths of Nature's heart?    Or, from the heart of him who sings,    And deems his hand upon the strings,        Is Nature's own?\"    This little book should do much to popularize bird-study and to spread  a knowledge of our common birds among our people. I hope devoutly that  an effort will be made to give them suitable names. We should give  them names a poet or a child can use. A Chaucer poring lovingly over  his favorite flower, the daisy, could call it by a name which is  itself full of poetry. Even the unimaginative clown, Nick Bottom,  could sing of      \"The Ouzel Cock, so black of hue,      With orange-tawny bill,    The Throstle with his note so true,      The Wren with little quill,    The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Lark,      The plain-song Cuckoo gray.\"    And a Burns can invoke the Throstle in lines as musical as the song of  the bird itself--\"And thou mellow mavis, that hails the night-fa'.\"    But how shall an Australian bard sing of \"The Red-rumped Acanthiza,\"  or of that delightful songster, \"The Rufous-breasted Thickhead\"?  Australian Nature-poetry will be handicapped until our children give  names like \"Bobolink,\" and \"Chickadee,\" and \"Whip-poor-will,\" and  \"Jacky Winter,\" to our birds.    \"Oriel,\" in the _Argus_, some time ago, showed how hard it is to write  of love's young dream in Australian verse.      \"Sweetheart, we watched the evening sky grow pale,      And drowsy sweetness stole away our senses,    While ran adown the swamp the Pectoral Rail,      The shy Hypotaenidia philippinensis.      \"How sweet a thing is love! Sweet as the rose,      Fragrant as flowers, fair as the sunlight beaming!    Only the Sooty Oyster-Catcher knows      How sweet to us, as there we lingered dreaming.      \"Dear, all the secret's ours. The Sharp-tailed Stint      Spied, but he will not tell--though you and I    Paid Cupid's debts from Love's own golden mint,      While Yellow-Bellied Shrike-Tits fluttered nigh.      \"The Honey-eaters heard; the Fuscous--yea,      The Warty-faced, the Lunulated, too;    But this kind feathered tribe will never say      What words you said to me, or I to you.      \"The golden bloom was glorious in the furze,      And gentle twittering came from out the copses;    It was the Carinated Flycatchers,      Or else the black Monarcha melanopsis.      \"That day our troth we plighted--blissful hour,      Beginning of a joy a whole life long!    And while the wide world seemed to be in flower,      The Chestnut-rumped Ground-Wren burst forth in song.\"    It surely would not be amiss if the Bird Observers' Clubs throughout  Australia, and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union, enlisted  the aid of the State Education Departments, and endeavored to find out  what names the children use for the birds of their district. Executive  committees upon bird names are good; but a good name is not evoked by  arguments in committee. It ofttimes comes from the happy inspiration  of some child who loves the bird. At present the names given by  classifiers are often an offence. A few evenings ago I was charmed  with an unaccustomed song coming from out a big pittosporum tree in  my garden at Kew. I took careful note of the little warbler, and then  consulted Mr. Leach's _Descriptive List_. Judge of my satisfaction  when I found that my little friend was \"The Striated Field Wren or  Stink Bird\"!    The Australian boy is responding splendidly to the Nature-study  movement. Bird observers tell me that shy native birds, formerly  unknown near the haunts of men, are making their appearance,  feeling safer now from molestation. Nest hunting for the sake of egg  spoliation is happily becoming rarer, although children are developing  keener eyes for nests. To-day every country school has its nests  under loving observation for the purposes of bird-study and of  bird-protection. Walt Whitman might have been describing many a  Victorian school boy when he wrote--      \"And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,    And every day the she-bird, crouched on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,    And every day, I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,    Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.\"    This loving study must bear good fruit.
