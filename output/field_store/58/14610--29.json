Yonder is a hornet, just alighted at the foot of the old oak-tree where  I am writing, so uncomfortably near my nose, indeed, that I can't help  wishing he had kept to his nest for another month; but the same April  sunshine that lured me out of doors lured the hornet, and there it  stands, all a-quiver with delight, on a budding acorn, looking every  moment as if it would part amidships.  \"Do you think, Mrs Hornet, O  thou tigress of bees, if your lovely body, with its bars of gold, had  been of any other colour, that, under the peculiar conditions in which  your ancestors lived, you would, ages ago, have ceased to exist; that  ants, or other `crawling ferlies,' who detest the colour of turmeric,  would, in spite of your ugly sting, have devoured you and yours?\"    Yonder, again, is a beautiful chaffinch; he was very glad to come to my  lawn-window every day, during all the weary winter, to beg a crumb of  bread.  He forgets that now, or thinks perhaps that I do not know him in  his spring suit of clothes, and golden-braided coat and vest.  But I do,  and I still believe--simple though the belief may be--that the same  Being, who gave life and motion to that little beetle which is now  making its way to the highest pinnacle of my note-book, as proud as a  boy with a new kite, to try its wings for the first time, tipped that  ungrateful finch's feathers with crimson, white, and gold, in order to  make him more attractive to his little dowdy thing of a wife, who has  been so busy all the morning building her nest on the silver birch, and  trying to find lichens to match the colour of the tree.  For Mrs Finch  is a nervous, timid little body, and had no thoughts of marrying at all,  and indeed would have preferred to remain single, and would have so  remained, had she not been a female; but being a female, how could she  resist that splendid uniform?    I go into the garden and bend me over the crocus beds--white crocuses,  orange crocuses, and blue, all smiling in the sunshine of spring.  Each  is a little family in itself, and they would like to know each other too  so very much, for they have ever so many love tales to breathe into each  other's ears.  But they are all fast by one end and cannot move.  Whatever shall they do, and what will become of the next generation of  crocuses?  I can hear them whispering their tales of love to the passing  wind, and so can you if you are a lover of Nature; but the wind is too  busy, or too light, or too something or another, and cannot pause to  listen.  So the little things are all in despair, when past comes a bee.  Now bees, and butterflies too, for all they have got so many eyes, are  rather short-sighted, but even a bee cannot help seeing that gorgeous  display of orange, white, and blue, so he pops at once into the bosom of  a blue crocus, and is made as welcome as the flowers in May.    \"Oh! you dear old bee,\" says the crocus, \"you're just come in time; have  something to eat first.  I have a nice little store of honey for you;  and then you shall bear a message to my lady-love--the pretty blue belle  crocus mind, not the white.  I wouldn't have a race of variegated  children for the world.\"    \"All right,\" says the bee, and away he flies with the message of love to  the blue belle crocus, and thus the loves of the crocuses are cemented.  They tell the old, old story by proxy, because they can't do it as you  or I do, reader, eye to eye and lip to lip.    For colour has its uses, and nothing that exists was made in vain,  although some are selfish enough to believe that all the colour and  beauty they see around them, during a ramble in the country, was made  but to please the eye of man.    Colour I believe to be connected in some way with the mystery of heat  and life.  We all know that certain colours will dispel or retain heat;  black is more warm, for instance, than white.  There may be, then, a  _scale_ of colours as it were, each colour differing in the amount of  heat-retaining power; and, it may be that, having reference to this  scale, the colours on an animal's coat, are apportioned to it in the way  which shall best conduce to its health, comfort, and happiness.    The colour of any animal is an important consideration in determining  its breed, and this is especially the case among cats, where indeed it  forms the basis of our classification.  Colour is often the key to the  character of the cat--to its temper, whether savage or good-natured; to  its qualities as a good hunter or the reverse; and to its power of  endurance, its eyesight, and its hearing.    _Size_.--Cats of different breeds--I use the word for want of a better--  are generally of different sizes, and the skeleton is, as a rule, larger  in some breeds than in others.  The male ought to be larger than the  female.    _Form_.--The difference in form is principally observable in the shape  and rotundity of skull, the length and shape of the nasal bones and jaw,  and the length of the tail and its form at the point.  The ears also  vary a good deal in length in the different breeds, and also in breadth,  and in \"sit\" or position.    _Pelage, or Coat_.--The coat is of two different kinds, the long and the  short.  In the former, the longer and softer and silkier the better, and  in the latter the length of the hairs, their closeness and glossiness,  are to be taken into consideration.  You can generally tell by one  glance at the animal's coat how she is fed, how she is treated and  housed, and the condition of her health.    Having got so far, we will next bring pussy herself on the stage, and  see how far these remarks apply to her, according to her breed and  species.    CHAPTER TWO.    BREEDS AND CLASSES.    In future chapters I will give the habits and characteristics of the  domestic cat in general, with some specialities of a few of the  different kinds in particular.  The \"tricks and manners\" of one cat,  however, will be found to correspond pretty closely with those of any  other.    But before going farther on with this chapter, I wish to make a plea in  pussy's favour.  I myself have studied cat life, off and on, for twenty  years, so I suppose it will be admitted I am no mean authority on the  subject.  During that time I have come to certain conclusions, which in  some cases run contrary to the opinions generally conceived of those  animals--contrary, at any rate, to the belief current some years ago,  before pussy was thought worthy to hold a show of her own.  Towards this  ocean of contrary opinions I have been wafted, not by the wind of my own  sails alone, but aided and supported by many hundreds of anecdotes of  domestic pussy's daily life, habits, likes and dislikes.  These  anecdotes have been supplied to me from trustworthy people, in every  position of life--from the poverty-stricken old maid with her one feline  favourite; from the honest working-man with his fireside pet and  children's playmate; from farmers, solicitors, doctors, and parsons;  from baronets' ladies; and, in more than one instance, from the  daughters of peers of the realm, allied to royalty itself.  These  anecdotes have, in almost every case, been substantially authenticated,  and _always_ discarded wherever, in any case, they were open to doubt.    From these anecdotes and essays, and from my own experience as well, I  have arrived at the following conclusions--and be it remembered I speak  of cats that are properly fed and housed, and have been taught habits of  cleanliness when kittens:--    1.  That cats are extremely sagacious.    2 That cats are cleanly and regular in their habits.    3.  That cats are fond of children.    4.  That cats are excellent mothers, and will nurse the young of any  small animal on the loss of their own.    5.  That cats are fond of roaming abroad.    6.  That cats are brave to a fault.    7.  That cats are fond of other animals as playmates.    8.  That cats are easily taught tricks.    9.  That cats are excellent hunters.    10.  That cats are good fishers, and can swim on occasion.    11.  That cats are very tenacious of life.    12.  That cats are fond of home.    13.  That cats are _fonder far of master or mistress_.    14.  That cats are _not_, as a rule, _thieves, but the reverse_.    15.  That long-headed, sharp-nosed cats are the best mousers.    These are not texts, but deductions.    All that is known for certain of the origin of the domestic cat may be  expressed in three letters, _n i l_--nil.  And, after all, I cannot see  that it matters very much, for if the theory of Darwin be correct, that  everything living sprang originally from the primordial cell, then cats  or dogs, or human beings, we all had the same origin.  But, again,  according to Darwin, the cat is an older animal than man in the world's  history; and if this be so, how silly of us to bother our heads in  trying to find out who first domesticated the cat, when in all  probability _it was the cat who first domesticated man_.  But, avaunt!  all learned discourse on the subject; perish all discursive lore.  I  have studied the matter over and over again, and read about it in  languages dead and living, till my head ached, and my heart was sick;  and still, for the life of me, I cannot make out that there are any more  than two distinct _species_ of domestic cats in existence.  There are,  first, the European or Western cat, a short-haired animal; and secondly,  the Asiatic or Eastern cat--called also Persian or Angora, according to  the difference in the texture of the coat, it being exceedingly fine,  soft, and satiny in the Angora, and not so much so in the Persian--a  long-haired cat.  All the others, such as Assyrian, Abyssinian, the  Maltese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, French, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37350"],[0,"The Ancestry of Modern Amphibia: A Review of the Evidence (#2)"],[1,"structure of carpus and tarsus, see a relationship of Urodela  to Dipnoi, but accept the derivation of labyrinthodonts and other  tetrapods from Rhipidistia. All of this work is most detailed and  laborious, and has produced a great quantity of data useful to  morphologists, but the diphyletic theory is not widely adopted; the  evidence adduced for it seems to consist largely of minutiae which,  taken by themselves, are inconclusive, or lend themselves to other  interpretation. For instance Holmgren's numerous figures of embryonic  limbs of salamanders show patterns of cartilage elements that he would  trace to the Dipnoan type of fin, yet it is difficult to see that the  weight of evidence requires this, when the pattern does not differ in  any fundamental manner from those seen in other embryonic tetrapods, and  the differences that do appear may well be taken to have ontogenetic  rather than phylogenetic meaning. Further, the Dipnoan specialization of  dental plates and autostylic jaw suspension, already accomplished early  in the Devonian, would seem to exclude Dipnoi from possible ancestry of  the Urodela, an order unknown prior to the Mesozoic, in which the teeth  are essentially similar to those of late Paleozoic Amphibia, and the jaw  suspension is not yet in all members autostylic.

In this position the  tympanum could receive airborne sounds whether the animal were entirely  on land or lying nearly submerged with only the upper part of its head  exposed. Among those Anura in which the ear is not reduced the same is  true, except that the tabular is lost. In Temnospondyli (Fig. 3) the  posterior wall of the otic capsule was usually formed by the opisthotic,  which extended up and outward as a buttress from the exoccipital to the  tabular, and sometimes showed a paroccipital process for the insertion,  presumably, of a slip or tendon of the anterior axial musculature. The  stapes, in addition to its foot in the fenestra ovalis and its tympanic  or extrastapedial process to the tympanum, bore a dorsal process (or  ligament) to the tabular, an \"internal\" process (or ligament) to the  quadrate or an adjacent part of the squamosal, and a ligament to the  ceratohyal. Some of these attachments might be reduced or absent in  special cases, but they seem to have been the ones originally present  both phylogenetically and embryonically in Amphibia.    Among typical frogs (Fig. 4) the base, or otostapes, is present and  bony, the extrastapedial process (extracolumella, or hyostapes) is  usually cartilaginous, the dorsal process (processus paroticus) is of  cartilage or ligament, but the other two attachments are absent in the  adult. The exoccipital extends laterally, occupying the posterior face  of the otic capsule. Between it and the otostapes is a small disc,  usually ossified, the operculum, which normally fits loosely in a  portion of the fenestral membrane, and is developed from the otic  capsule. The opercularis muscle extends from this disc to the  suprascapula, in many but by no means all families of Anura.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Diagram of middle ear structures in _Rana_ (upper  figure, after Stadtmueller, 1936, and lower left after DeBeer, 1937), and  _Ambystoma_ (lower right, after DeBeer, 1937); all x 4. For explanation  of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]    Among Urodela (Fig. 4) the middle ear cavity and tympanum are lacking,  and the stapes (columella) consists of no more than its footplate and  the stylus, which is attached to the border of the squamosal, thus  corresponding to the \"internal\" process. In families in which  individuals metamorphose and become terrestrial (Hynobiidae,  Ambystomidae, Salamandridae, Plethodontidae), an operculum and  opercularis muscle appear in the adult, just as in frogs, except that in  Plethodontidae, the most progressive family, the operculum fuses with  the footplate of the stapes. Among neotenous or perennibranchiate  urodeles there is no separate operculum or opercularis. The evidence  given by Reed (1915) for fusion of the operculum with the columella in  _Necturus_ appears inconclusive, in spite of the great care with which  his observations were made. On the other hand, _Necturus_ and _Proteus_  alone among living salamanders have a distinct opisthotic on the  posterior wall of the otic capsule (Fig. 3), as do the Cretaceous  _Hylaeobatrachus_ and the Eocene _Palaeoproteus_. Probably these  Proteidae should be regarded as primitive in this respect, although many  other features may be attributed to neoteny.    There is a contrast between Anura and most Urodela in the relative  positions of the stapes and facial nerve, as shown in DeBeer's (1937)  diagrams. In the latter (_Ambystoma_) the nerve is beneath, and in the  former (_Rana_) above, the stapes. Judging by figures of _Neoceratodus_,  _Hypogeophis_, and several types of reptiles and mammals, the Urodela  are exceptional. _Necturus_, however, has the nerve passing above its  stapes, and this may be primitive in the same sense as the persistent  opisthotic. There can be, of course, no question of the nerve having  worked its way through or over the obstructing stapes in order to come  below it in salamanders; rather, the peripheral growth of neuron fibers  in the embryo must simply pursue a slightly different course among the  partially differentiated mesenchyme in the two contrasting patterns.    Although DeBeer (1937) shows in his figure of _Hypogeophis_ (one of the  Apoda) an operculum, this is apparently a mistake. The stapes has a  large footplate, and its stylus articulates with the quadrate, but no  true operculum or opercularis has been described in the Apoda. The  facial nerve passes above the stapes. It does not seem necessary to  regard the conditions in this order as related directly to those of  either salamanders or frogs, but a reduction of the stapes comparable to  that in salamanders has occurred.    The presence in both frogs and terrestrial salamanders of a special  mechanism involving the opercularis muscle and an operculum cut out in  identical fashion from the wall of the otic capsule behind the stapes  seems to require some other explanation than that of a chance  convergence or parallelism. Although the stapes and otic region are  readily visible in a number of labyrinthodonts and lepospondyls, no  indication of an operculum seems to be reported among them. But in the  Triassic _Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 1), which is unmistakably a frog in its  skull, pelvis and some other features, Piveteau (1937) has shown,  immediately behind the foot of the stapes, a small bony tubercle, which  he and Watson (1940) designated opisthotic. Very clearly it served for  insertion of a muscle, and it is equally clear that the bone is a  reduced opisthotic, carrying the paroccipital process already mentioned  as characteristic of it in some temnospondyls. Since the remainder of  the posterior wall of the otic capsule consists of cartilage, meeting  the exoccipital, it may be that the opisthotic becomes the operculum in  frogs. _Protobatrachus_ was too far specialized in the Anuran direction,  although it still had a tail, and the forelegs and hind legs were nearly  the same size, to be considered a possible ancestor of the Urodeles. But  at one stage in the general reduction of the skull in the ancestry of  both groups, a condition similar to that in _Protobatrachus_ may have  characterized the otic region, long before the Triassic.    In the argument thus far we have considered terrestrial, adult  amphibians, since it is only in these that either the normal middle ear  and tympanum, or the opercular apparatus, is present. But among the  urodeles several neotenic types occur (this term applies also to the  perennibranchs). For most of these there is nothing about the otic  region that would be inconsistent with derivation, by neoteny, from  known families in which adults are terrestrial; for example,  _Cryptobranchus_ could have had a Hynobiid-like ancestor. But this, as  mentioned above, does not hold for the Proteidae, which possess an  opisthotic of"]]]
