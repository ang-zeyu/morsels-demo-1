Talent Bourrienne had in  abundance; indeed he is careful to hint that at school if any one had  been asked to predict greatness for any pupil, it was Bourrienne, not  Napoleon, who would have been fixed on as the future star. He went with  his General to Egypt, and returned with him to France. While Napoleon  was making his formal entry into the Tuileries, Bourrienne was preparing  the cabinet he was still to share with the Consul. In this cabinet--our  cabinet, as he is careful to call it--he worked with the First Consul  till 1802.    During all this time the pair lead lived on terms of equality and  friendship creditable to both. The secretary neither asked for nor  received any salary: when he required money, he simply dipped into the  cash-box of the First Consul. As the whole power of the State gradually  passed into the hands of the Consul, the labours of the secretary became  heavier. His successor broke down under a lighter load, and had to  receive assistance; but, perhaps borne up by the absorbing interest of  the work and the great influence given by his post, Bourrienne stuck to  his place, and to all appearance might, except for himself, have come  down to us as the companion of Napoleon during his whole life. He had  enemies, and one of them--[Boulay de la Meurthe.]--has not shrunk from  describing their gratification at the disgrace of the trusted secretary.  Any one in favour, or indeed in office, under Napoleon was the sure  mark of calumny for all aspirants to place; yet Bourrienne might  have weathered any temporary storm raised by unfounded reports as  successfully as Meneval, who followed him. But Bourrienne's hands were  not clean in money matters, and that was an unpardonable sin in any one  who desired to be in real intimacy with Napoleon. He became involved in  the affairs of the House of Coulon, which failed, as will be seen in the  notes, at the time of his disgrace; and in October 1802 he was called on  to hand over his office to Meneval, who retained it till invalided after  the Russian campaign.    As has been said, Bourrienne would naturally be the mark for many  accusations, but the conclusive proof of his misconduct--at least for  any one acquainted with Napoleon's objection and dislike to changes in  office, whether from his strong belief in the effects of training, or  his equally strong dislike of new faces round him--is that he was never  again employed near his old comrade; indeed he really never saw the  Emperor again at any private interview, except when granted the naval  official reception in 1805, before leaving to take up his post at  Hamburg, which he held till 1810. We know that his re-employment was  urged by Josephine and several of his former companions. Savary himself  says he tried his advocacy; but Napoleon was inexorable to those who, in  his own phrase, had sacrificed to the golden calf.    Sent, as we have said, to Hamburg in 1805, as Minister Plenipotentiary  to the Duke of Brunswick, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and to the  Hanse towns, Bourrienne knew how to make his post an important one.  He was at one of the great seats of the commerce which suffered so  fearfully from the Continental system of the Emperor, and he was charged  to watch over the German press. How well he fulfilled this duty we learn  from Metternich, who writes in 1805: \"I have sent an article to the  newspaper editors in Berlin and to M. de Hofer at Hamburg. I do not  know whether it has been accepted, for M. Bourrienne still exercises an  authority so severe over these journals that they are always submitted  to him before they appear, that he may erase or alter the articles which  do not please him.\"    His position at Hamburg gave him great opportunities for both financial  and political intrigues. In his Memoirs, as Meneval remarks, he or his  editor is not ashamed to boast of being thanked by Louis XVIII. at St.  Ouen for services rendered while he was the minister of Napoleon at  Hamburg. He was recalled in 1810, when the Hanse towns were united,  or, to use the phrase of the day, re-united to the Empire. He then hung  about Paris, keeping on good terms with some of the ministers--Savary,  not the most reputable of them, for example. In 1814 he was to be found  at the office of Lavallette, the head of the posts, disguising, his  enemies said, his delight at the bad news which was pouring in, by  exaggerated expressions of devotion. He is accused of a close and  suspicious connection with Talleyrand, and it is odd that when  Talleyrand became head of the Provisional Government in 1814, Bourrienne  of all persons should have been put at the head of the posts. Received  in the most flattering manner by Louis XVIII, he was as astonished as  poor Beugnot was in 1815, to find himself on 13th May suddenly ejected  from office, having, however, had time to furnish post-horses to  Manbreuil for the mysterious expedition, said to have been at least  known to Talleyrand, and intended certainly for the robbery of the Queen  of Westphalia, and probably for the murder of Napoleon.    In the extraordinary scurry before the Bourbons scuttled out of Paris  in 1814, Bourrienne was made Prefet of the Police for a few days, his  tenure of that post being signalised by the abortive attempt to arrest  Fouché, the only effect of which was to drive that wily minister into  the arms of the Bonapartists.    He fled with the King, and was exempted from the amnesty proclaimed  by Napoleon. On the return from Ghent he was made a Minister of State  without portfolio, and also became one of the Council. The ruin of his  finances drove him out of France, but he eventually died in a madhouse  at Caen.    When the Memoirs first appeared in 1829 they made a great sensation.  Till then in most writings Napoleon had been treated as either a demon  or as a demi-god. The real facts of the case were not suited to the  tastes of either his enemies or his admirers. While the monarchs of  Europe had been disputing among themselves about the division of the  spoils to be obtained from France and from the unsettlement of the  Continent, there had arisen an extraordinarily clever and unscrupulous  man who, by alternately bribing and overthrowing the great monarchies,  had soon made himself master of the mainland. His admirers were  unwilling to admit the part played in his success by the jealousy of his  foes of each other's share in the booty, and they delighted to invest  him with every great quality which man could possess. His enemies were  ready enough to allow his military talents, but they wished to attribute  the first success of his not very deep policy to a marvellous duplicity,  apparently considered by them the more wicked as possessed by a parvenu  emperor, and far removed, in a moral point of view, from the statecraft  so allowable in an ancient monarchy. But for Napoleon himself and his  family and Court there was literally no limit to the really marvellous  inventions of his enemies. He might enter every capital on the  Continent, but there was some consolation in believing that he himself  was a monster of wickedness, and his Court but the scene of one long  protracted orgie.    There was enough against the Emperor in the Memoirs to make them  comfortable reading for his opponents, though very many of the old  calumnies were disposed of in them. They contained indeed the nearest  approximation to the truth which had yet appeared. Metternich, who must  have been a good judge, as no man was better acquainted with what he  himself calls the \"age of Napoleon,\" says of the Memoirs: \"If you want  something to read, both interesting and amusing, get the Memoires de  Bourrienne. These are the only authentic Memoirs of Napoleon which have  yet appeared. The style is not brilliant, but that only makes them the  mere trustworthy.\" Indeed, Metternich himself in his own Memoirs  often follows a good deal in the line of Bourrienne: among many formal  attacks, every now and then he lapses into half involuntary and indirect  praise of his great antagonist, especially where he compares the men  he had to deal with in aftertimes with his former rapid and talented  interlocutor. To some even among the Bonapartists, Bourrienne was not  altogether distasteful. Lucien Bonaparte, remarking that the time in  which Bourrienne treated with Napoleon as equal with equal did not last  long enough for the secretary, says he has taken a little revenge in his  Memoirs, just as a lover, after a break with his mistress, reveals all  her defects. But Lucien considers that Bourrienne gives us a good enough  idea of the young officer of the artillery, of the great General, and  of the First Consul. Of the Emperor, says Lucien, he was too much in  retirement to be able to judge equally well. But Lucien was not a fair  representative of the Bonapartists; indeed he had never really thought  well of his brother or of his actions since Lucien, the former \"Brutus\"  Bonaparte, had ceased to be the adviser of the Consul. It was well for  Lucien himself to amass a fortune from the presents of a corrupt court,  and to be made a Prince and Duke by the Pope, but he was too sincere  a republican not to disapprove of the imperial system. The real  Bonapartists were naturally and inevitably furious with the Memoirs.  They were not true, they were not the work of Bourrienne, Bourrienne  himself was a traitor, a purloiner of manuscripts, his memory was as bad  as his principles, he was not even entitled to the de before his name.  If the Memoirs were at all to be pardoned, it was because his share was  only really a few notes wrung from him by large pecuniary offers at  a time when he was pursued by his creditors, and when his brain was  already affected.    The Bonapartist attack on the Memoirs was delivered in full form, in  two volumes, 'Bourrienne et ses Erreurs, Volontaires et Involontaires'  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#2)"],[1,"to: _Timaeus_, sec. 39 (III, 459 in Jowett's  translation).]    [Footnote 7: Aristotle: _De Mundo_, c. 2 et 6 (III, 628 and 636).]    The stars were an even greater problem. Anaximenes thought they were  \"fastened like nails\" in a crystalline firmament, and others thought  them to be \"fiery plates of gold resembling pictures.\"[8] But if the  heavens were solid, how could the brief presence of a comet be  explained?    [Footnote 8: Plutarch: _Op. cit._, Lib. III, c. 2 (V, 303-4).]    Among the philosophers were some noted as mathematicians whose leader  was Pythagoras (c. 550 B.C.). He and at least one of the members of  his school, Eudoxus (409?-356? B.C.), had visited Egypt, according to  Diogenes Laertius,[9] and had in all probability been much interested  in and influenced by the astronomical observations made by the  Egyptian priests. On the same authority, Pythagoras was the first to  declare the earth was round and to discuss the antipodes. He too  emphasized the beauty and perfection of the circle and of the sphere  in geometry, forms which became fixed for 2000 years as the fittest  representations of the perfection of the heavenly bodies.    [Footnote 9: Diogenes Laertius: _De Vitis_, Lib. VIII, c. 1, et 8  (205, 225).]    There was some discussion in Diogenes' time as to the author of the  theory of the earth's motion of axial rotation. Diogenes[10] gives the  honor to Philolaus (5th cent. B.C.) one of the Pythagoreans, though he  adds that others attribute it to Icetas of Syracuse (6th or 5th cent.  B.C.). Cicero, however, states[11] the position of Hicetas of Syracuse  as a belief in the absolute fixedness of all the heavenly bodies  except the earth, which alone moves in the whole universe, and that  its rapid revolutions upon its own axis cause the heavens apparently  to move and the earth to stand still.    [Footnote 10: Diogenes: _Op. cit._, Lib. VIII, c. 7 (225).]    [Footnote 11: Cicero: _Academica_, Lib. II, c. 39 (322).]    Other thinkers of Syracuse may also have felt the Egyptian influence;  for one of the greatest of them, Archimedes (c. 287-212 B.C.), stated  the theory of the earth's revolution around the sun as enunciated by  Aristarchus of Samos. (Perhaps this is the \"hearth-fire of the  universe\" around which Philolaus imagined the earth to whirl.[12]) In  _Arenarius_, a curious study on the possibility of expressing infinite  sums by numerical denominations as in counting the sands of the  universe, Archimedes writes:[13] \"For you have known that the universe  is called a sphere by several astrologers, its center the center of  the earth, and its radius equal to a line drawn from the center of the  sun to the center of the earth. This was written for the unlearned, as  you have known from the astrologers.... [Aristarchus of Samos][14]  concludes that the world is many times greater than the estimate we  have just given. He supposes that the fixed stars and the sun remain  motionless, but that the earth following a circular course, revolves  around the sun as a center, and that the sphere of the fixed stars  having the same sun as a center, is so vast that the circle which he  supposes the earth to follow in revolving holds the same ratio to the  distance of the fixed stars as the center of a sphere holds to its  circumference.\"    [Footnote 12: Plutarch: _Op. cit._, Lib. II (V. 299-300).]    [Footnote 13: Archimedes: _Arenarius_, c. 1. Delambre: _Astr. Anc._,  I, 102.]    [Footnote 14: This is the only account of his system. Even the age in  which he flourished is so little known that there have been many  disputes whether he was the original inventor of this system or  followed some other. He was probably a contemporary of Cleanthes the  Stoic in the 3rd century B.C. He is mentioned also by Ptolemy,  Diogenes Laertius and Vitruvius. (Schiaparelli: _Die Vorlaufer des  Copernicus im Alterthum_, 75. See also Heath: _Op. cit._)]    These ancient philosophers realized in some degree the immensity of  the universe in which the earth was but a point. They held that the  earth was an unsupported sphere the size of which Eratosthenes (c.  276-194 B.C.) had calculated approximately. They knew the sun was far  larger than the earth, and Cicero with other thinkers recognized the  insignificance of earthly affairs in the face of such cosmic  immensity. They knew too about the seven planets, had studied their  orbits, and worked out astronomical ways of measuring the passage of  time with a fair amount of accuracy. Hipparchus and other thinkers had  discovered the fact of the precession of the equinoxes, though there  was no adequate theory to account for it until Copernicus formulated  his \"motion of declination.\" The Pythagoreans accepted the idea of the  earth's turning upon its axis, and some even held the idea of its  revolution around the motionless sun. Others suggested that comets had  orbits which they uniformly followed and therefore their reappearance  could be anticipated.[15]    [Footnote 15: Plutarch: _Op. cit._: Bk. III, c. 2 (V, 317-318).]    Why then was the heliocentric theory not definitely accepted?    In the first place, such a theory was contrary to the supposed facts  of daily existence. A man did not have to be trained in the schools to  observe that the earth seemed stable under his feet and that each  morning the sun swept from the east to set at night in the west.  Sometimes it rose more to the north or to the south than at other  times. How could that be explained if the sun were stationary?    Study of the stars was valuable for navigators and for surveyors,  perhaps, but such disturbing theories should not be propounded by  philosophers. Cleanthes,[16] according to Plutarch,[17] \"advised that  the Greeks ought to have prosecuted Aristarchus the Samian for  blasphemy against religion, as shaking the very foundations of the  world, because this man endeavoring to save appearances, supposed that  the heavens remained immovable and that the earth moved through an  oblique circle, at the same time turning about its own axis.\" Few  would care to face their fellows as blasphemers and impious thinkers  on behalf of an unsupported theory. Eighteen hundred years later  Galileo would not do so, even though in his day the theory was by no  means unsupported by observation.    [Footnote 16: The Stoic contemporary of Aristarchus, author of the  famous Stoic hymn. See Diogenes Laertius: _De Vitis_.]    [Footnote 17: Plutarch: _De Facie in Orbe Lunae_, (V, 410).]    Furthermore, one of the weaknesses of the Greek civilization militated  strongly against the acceptance of this hypothesis so contrary to the  evidence of the senses. Experimentation and the development of applied  science was practically an impossibility where the existence of slaves  made manual labor degrading and shameful. Men might reason  indefinitely; but few, if any, were willing to try to improve the  instruments of observation or to test their observations by  experiments.    At the same time another astronomical theory was developing which was  an adequate explanation for the phenomena observed up to that  time.[18] This theory of epicycles and eccentrics worked out by  Apollonius of Perga (c. 225 B.C.) and by Hipparchus (c. 160 B.C.) and  crystallized for posterity in Ptolemy's great treatise on astronomy,  the _Almagest_, (c. 140 A.D.) became the fundamental principle of the  science until within the last three hundred years. The theory of the  eccentric was based on the idea that heavenly bodies Following  circular orbits revolved around a center that did not coincide with  that of the observer on the earth. That would explain why the sun  appeared sometimes nearer the earth and sometimes farther away. The  epicycle represented the heavenly body as moving along the  circumference of one circle (called the epicycle) the center of which  moves on another circle (the deferent). With better observations  additional epicycles and eccentric were used to represent the newly  observed phenomena till in the later Middle Ages the universe became a                                      \"----Sphere      With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er,      Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb\"--[19]    [Footnote 18: Young: 109.]    [Footnote 19: Milton: _Paradise Lost_, Bk. VIII, ll. 82-85.]    Yet the heliocentric theory was not forgotten. Vitruvius, a famous  Roman architect of the Augustan Age, discussing the system of the  universe, declared that Mercury and Venus, the planets nearest the  sun, moved around it as their center, though the earth was the center  of the universe.[20] This same notion recurs in Martianus Capella's  book[21] in the fifth century A.D. and again, somewhat modified, in  the 16th century in Tycho Brahe's conception of the universe.    [Footnote 20: Vitruvius: _De Architectura_, Lib. IX, c. 4 (220).]    [Footnote 21: Martianus Capella: _De Nuptiis_, Lib. VIII, (668).]    Ptolemy devotes a column or two of his _Almagest_[22] (to use the  familiar Arabic name for his _Syntaxis Mathematica_) to the refutation  of the heliocentric theory, thereby preserving it for later ages to  ponder on and for a Copernicus to develop. He admits at the outset  that such a theory is only tenable for the stars and their phenomena,  and he gives at least three reasons why it is ridiculous. If the earth  were not at the center, the observed facts of the seasons and of day  and night would be disturbed and even upset. If the earth moves, its  vastly greater mass would gain in speed upon other bodies, and soon  animals and other lighter bodies would be left behind unsupported in  the air--a notion \"ridiculous to the last degree,\" as he comments,  \"even to imagine it.\" Lastly, if it moves, it would have such  tremendous velocity that stones or arrows shot straight up in the air  must fall to the ground east of their starting point,--a \"laughable  supposition\" indeed to Ptolemy.
