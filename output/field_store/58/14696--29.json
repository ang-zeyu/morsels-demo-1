The intervening months passed rapidly away, and I fear that I did not  make much progress, yet I thought I should be able to pass the  preliminary examination.  That which was to follow worried me more  and gave me many sleepless nights; but these would have been less in  number, I fully believe, had it not been for one specification of my,  outfit which the circular that accompanied my appointment demanded.  This requirement was a pair of \"Monroe shoes.\"  Now, out in Ohio,  what \"Monroe shoes\" were was a mystery--not a shoemaker in my section  having so much as an inkling of the construction of the perplexing  things, until finally my eldest brother brought an idea of them from  Baltimore, when it was found that they were a familiar pattern under  another name.    At length the time for my departure came, and I set out for West  Point, going by way of Cleveland and across Lake Erie to Buffalo.  On  the steamer I fell in with another appointee en route to the academy,  David S. Stanley, also from Ohio; and when our acquaintanceship had  ripened somewhat, and we had begun to repose confidence in each  other, I found out that he had no \"Monroe shoes,\" so I deemed myself  just that much ahead of my companion, although my shoes might not  conform exactly to the regulations in Eastern style and finish.  At  Buffalo, Stanley and I separated, he going by the Erie Canal and I by  the railroad, since I wanted to gain time on account of commands to  stop in Albany to see my father's uncle.  Here I spent a few days,  till Stanley reached Albany, when we journeyed together down the  river to West Point.  The examination began a few days after our  arrival, and I soon found myself admitted to the Corps of Cadets, to  date from July 1, 1848, in a class composed of sixty-three members,  many of whom--for example, Stanley, Slocum, Woods, Kautz, and Crook  --became prominent generals in later years, and commanded divisions,  corps, and armies in the war of the rebellion.    Quickly following my admission I was broken in by a course of hazing,  with many of the approved methods that the Cadets had handed down  from year to year since the Academy was founded; still, I escaped  excessive persecution, although there were in my day many occurrences  so extreme as to call forth condemnation and an endeavor to suppress  the senseless custom, which an improved civilization has now about  eradicated, not only at West Point, but at other colleges.    Although I had met the Academic board and come off with fair success,  yet I knew so little of Algebra or any of the higher branches of  mathematics that during my first six months at the Academy I was  discouraged by many misgivings as to the future, for I speedily  learned that at the January examination the class would have to stand  a test much severer than that which had been applied to it on  entering.  I resolved to try hard, however, and, besides, good  fortune gave me for a room-mate a Cadet whose education was more  advanced than mine, and whose studious habits and willingness to aid  others benefited me immensely.  This room-mate was Henry W. Slocum,  since so signally distinguished in both military and civil capacities  as to win for his name a proud place in the annals of his country.  After taps--that is, when by the regulations of the Academy all the  lights were supposed to be extinguished, and everybody in bed--Slocum  and I would hang a blanket over the one window of our room and  continue our studies--he guiding me around scores of stumbling-blocks  in Algebra and elucidating many knotty points in other branches of  the course with which I was unfamiliar.  On account of this  association I went up before the Board in January with less  uneasiness than otherwise would have been the case, and passed the  examination fairly well.  When it was over, a self-confidence in my  capacity was established that had not existed hitherto, and at each  succeeding examination I gained a little in order of merit till my  furlough summer came round--that is, when I was half through the  four-year course.    My furlough in July and August, 1850, was spent at my home in Ohio,  with the exception of a visit or two to other Cadets on furlough in  the State, and at the close of my leave I returned to the Academy in  the full expectation of graduating with my class in 1852.    A quarrel of a belligerent character in September, ,1851, with Cadet  William R. Terrill, put an end to this anticipation, however, and  threw me back into the class which graduated in 1853.  Terrill was a  Cadet Sergeant, and, while my company was forming for parade, having,  given me an order, in what I considered an improper tone, to \"dress\"  in a certain direction, when I believed I was accurately dressed, I  fancied I had a grievance, and made toward him with a lowered  bayonet, but my better judgment recalled me before actual contact  could take place.  Of course Terrill reported me for this, and my ire  was so inflamed by his action that when we next met I attacked him,  and a fisticuff engagement in front of barracks followed, which was  stopped by an officer appearing on the scene.  Each of us handed in  an explanation, but mine was unsatisfactory to the authorities, for I  had to admit that I was the assaulting party, and the result was that  I was suspended by the Secretary of War, Mr. Conrad, till August 28,  1852--the Superintendent of the Academy, Captain Brewerton, being  induced to recommend this milder course, he said, by my previous good  conduct.  At the time I thought, of course, my suspension a very  unfair punishment, that my conduct was justifiable and the  authorities of the Academy all wrong, but riper experience has led me  to a different conclusion, and as I look back, though the  mortification I then endured was deep and trying, I am convinced that  it was hardly as much as I deserved for such an outrageous breach of  discipline.    There was no question as to Terrill's irritating tone, but in giving  me the order he was prompted by the duty of his position as a file  closer, and I was not the one to remedy the wrong which I conceived  had been done me, and clearly not justifiable in assuming to correct  him with my own hands.  In 1862, when General Buell's army was  assembling at Louisville, Terrill was with it as a brigadier-general  (for, although a Virginian, he had remained loyal), and I then took  the initiative toward a renewal of our acquaintance.  Our renewed  friendship was not destined to be of long duration, I am sorry to  say, for a few days later, in the battle of Perryville, while  gallantly fighting for his country, poor Terrill was killed.    My suspension necessitated my leaving the Academy, and I returned  home in the fall of 1851, much crestfallen.  Fortunately, my good  friend Henry Dittoe again gave me employment in keeping the books of  his establishment, and this occupation of my time made the nine  months which were to elapse before I could go back to West Point pass  much more agreeably than they would have done had I been idle.  In  August, 1852, I joined the first class at the Academy in accordance  with the order of the War Department, taking my place at the foot of  the class and graduating with it the succeeding June, number  thirty-four in a membership of fifty-two.  At the head of this class  graduated James B. McPherson, who was killed in the Atlanta campaign  while commanding the Army of the Tennessee.  It also contained such  men as John M. Schofield, who commanded the Army of the Ohio; Joshua  W. Sill, killed as a brigadier in the battle of Stone River; and many  others who, in the war of the rebellion, on one side or the other,  rose to prominence, General John B. Hood being the most distinguished  member of the class among the Confederates.    At the close of the final examination I made no formal application  for assignment to any particular arm of the service, for I knew that  my standing would not entitle me to one of the existing vacancies,  and that I should be obliged to take a place among the brevet second  lieutenants.  When the appointments were made I therefore found  myself attached to the First Infantry, well pleased that I had  surmounted all the difficulties that confront the student at our  national school, and looking forward with pleasant anticipation to  the life before me.          CHAPTER II.    ORDERED TO FORT DUNCAN, TEXAS--\"NORTHERS\"--SCOUTING  DUTY--HUNTING--NEARLY CAUGHT BY THE INDIANS--A PRIMITIVE HABITATION  --A BRAVE DRUMMERBOY'S DEATH--A MEXICAN BALL.    On the 1st day of July, 1853, I was commissioned a brevet second  lieutenant in the First Regiment of United States Infantry, then  stationed in Texas.  The company to which I was attached was  quartered at Fort Duncan, a military post on the Rio Grande opposite  the little town of Piedras Negras, on the boundary line between the  United States and the Republic of Mexico.    After the usual leave of three months following graduation from the  Military Academy I was assigned to temporary duty at Newport  Barracks, a recruiting station and rendezvous for the assignment of  young officers preparatory to joining their regiments.  Here I  remained from September, 1853, to March, 1854, when I was ordered to  join my company at Fort Duncan.  To comply with this order I  proceeded by steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New  Orleans, thence by steamer across the Gulf of Mexico to Indianola,  Tex., and after landing at that place, continued in a small schooner  through what is called the inside channel on the Gulf coast to Corpus  Christi, the headquarters of Brigadier-General Persifer F. Smith, who  was commanding the Department of Texas.  Here I met some of my old  friends from the Military Academy, among them Lieutenant Alfred  Gibbs, who in the last year of the rebellion commanded under me a  brigade of cavalry, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#2)"],[1," philosophical thinking; one has here to  learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and \"innateness.\" As  little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process  and procedure of heredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" OPPOSED  to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the  conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his  instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and  its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak  more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite  mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the  uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than \"truth\" such valuations,  in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be  only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may  be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,  in effect, that man is not just the \"measure of things.\"    4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is  here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The  question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,  species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally  inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic  judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that  without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of  reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,  without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,  man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be  a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A  CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of  value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,  has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.    5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully  and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they  are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in  short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not  enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and  virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in  the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had  been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,  divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,  who, fairer and foolisher, talk of \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact, a  prejudiced proposition, idea, or \"suggestion,\" which is generally  their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with  arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not  wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their  prejudices, which they dub \"truths,\"--and VERY far from having the  conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having  the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be  understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence  and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally  stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic  by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his \"categorical  imperative\"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small  amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical  preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by  means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and  mask--in fact, the \"love of HIS wisdom,\" to translate the term fairly  and squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart  of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible  maiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and  vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!    6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up  till now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and  a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover  that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted  the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.  Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a  philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first  ask oneself: \"What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\" Accordingly,  I do not believe that an \"impulse to knowledge\" is the father of  philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made  use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever  considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining  how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and  cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time  or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to  look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate  LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as  SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in  the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--\"better,\" if  you will; there there may really be such a thing as an \"impulse to  knowledge,\" some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well  wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of  the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual  \"interests\" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another  direction--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;  it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little  machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a  good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not  CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the  contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,  his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE  IS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature  stand to each other.    7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging  than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the  Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense,  and on the face of it, the word signifies \"Flatterers of  Dionysius\"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles;  besides this, however, it is as much as to say, \"They are all ACTORS,  there is nothing genuine about them\" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular  name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that  Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the  mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of  which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos,  who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three  hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who  knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god  Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?    8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the \"conviction\" of  the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an  ancient mystery:    Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.    9. You desire to LIVE \"according to Nature\"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what  fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly  extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,  without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:  imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live  in accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just  endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,  preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?  And granted that your imperative, \"living according to Nature,\" means  actually the same as \"living according to life\"--how could you do  DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves  are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:  while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,  you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players  and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and  ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;  you insist that it shall be Nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and would  like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal  glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,  you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such  hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,  that you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some  unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that  BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is  self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is  not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting  story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today,  as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always  creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy  is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the  will to \"creation of the world,\" the will to the causa prima.    10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with  which the problem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at  present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and  he who hears"]]]
