How great was the tension may be known from the fact of the  contemplated emigration to the American colonies of such leaders as Lord  Saye and Sele, Lord Warwick, Lord Brooke, and Sir John Hampden and Oliver  Cromwell. When the rupture at last came, the Parliament was found to have  secured the larger arsenals, and also to have forces at its disposal in  the trained bands of London and in the militia, which it was enabled  rapidly to enrol. Though the unfurling of the Royal Standard near  Nottingham failed to secure many adherents to the King's cause, Essex  hesitated to attack the royalists when they might have been easily  dispersed, thinking no doubt to overawe the King by mere show of force.  Yet when Charles began recruiting in the neighbourhood of Shrewsbury, he  was soon able to gather an army, and on October 12th, 1642, he commenced  his march upon London. The astute and carefully moderate policy of the  Commons was to rescue the King from his surroundings, and to destroy the  enemies, especially the foreign enemies, of the State, about the King's  person. The sanctity of the King's person was yet a prominent factor--the  belief in divinity of Kingship, notwithstanding all the misrule there had  been, was yet alive in the hearts of the people. Therefore when the King  had gathered his forces together and began his Southward march, Lord Essex  with his army was commissioned \"to march against his Majesties Army and  fight with them, and to rescue the persons of the King, Prince and Duke of  York.\" The Earl of Essex, with the Parliamentarian forces, was at that  time in Worcestershire, endeavouring to prevent the recruiting of the  King's troops; and though the Earl moved two days later on by rapid  marches into Warwickshire, it was only to find that he had been  out-marched by the King, who, after resting at Southam, stood with the  Royalist army at Edgcot across the way to the capital. That this had been  accomplished, notwithstanding the opposition of the strongholds of Warwick  and Coventry, speaks not unfavourably for the generalship of Earl Lindsay,  the King's Lieutenant-General, whom we find at Edgcot contemplating an  attack upon Banbury Castle. The King's was a good position: it commanded  all the roads to London, held Banbury in its hand, covered the Cherwell  bridge and fords, and had within touch the dominating escarpment of Edge  Hill. If the purpose was the subjection of some prominent leaders of the  Parliamentarians it succeeded only in the taking of Lord Saye and Sele's  house at Broughton, and of Banbury, and Banbury Castle; in the partial  destruction of Lord Spencer's house[B] at Wormleighton, and in sending a  summons to Warwick Castle[P] to surrender.    Kineton, on October 22nd, was the headquarters of the Parliamentary army,  the troops in the evening disposing themselves on the surrounding plain.  \"The common soldiers have not come into a bed, but lain in the open field  in the wet and cold nights,\" says the Worthy Divine[PG] \"and most of them  scarcely eat or drank at all for 24 hours together, nay, for 48, except  fresh water when they could get it.\" The want of transport, which had  necessitated Hampden and Hollis struggling behind a day's march in the  rear in the neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon, had no doubt entailed  these privations upon the army. Nor do the Royalists appear to have fared  better, for Clarendon[B381] complains of the hostility of the country  people, stating also that the circuit in which the battle was fought,  being between the dominions of Lord Saye and Lord Brooke, was the most  eminently corrupt of any in the kingdom. The King's forces seem to have  been quartered about the country between Wormleighton and Cropredy, Prince  Rupert with his cavalry near Wormleighton, the King himself staying at  Edgcot House, whilst the main body of the army occupied the slopes and  high lands on the Northamptonshire side of the Cherwell vale near by. Thus  the three roads North of Banbury were dominated by the Royalist troops,  and the fourth, the old London road, was within striking distance.    The preaching of the local divines, Robert Harris, John Dod, and Robert  Cleaver, had no doubt added largely to the enthusiasm of the country folk  for the cause of the Commons. Though no great increase of the King's  forces could be expected in such a district, yet there is an interesting  account in Kimber and Johnson's Baronetage[NO] (1771) of a country  gentleman Mr. (afterwards Sir Richard) Shuckburgh:    \"Sir Richard Shuckburgh, Knt., eldest son and heir, was in no way inferior  to his ancestors. As King Charles I. marched to Edgecot, near Banbury, on  October 22nd, 1642, he saw him hunting in the fields with a very good pack  of hounds, upon which it is reported that he fetched a deep sigh, and  asked who the gentleman was that hunted so merrily that morning when he  was going to fight for his crown and dignity; and being told that it was  this Richard Shuckburgh, he was graciously ordered to be called to him,  and was by him very graciously received. Upon which he went immediately  home, armed all his tenants, and the next day attended him in the field,  where he was knighted, and was present at the battle of Edge Hill. After  the taking of Banbury Castle, and his Majesty's retreat from those parts,  he went to his own seat and fortified himself on the top of Shuckborough  Hill, where, being attacked by some of the Parliament forces, he defended  himself till he fell, with most of his tenants about him; but being taken  up and life perceived in him, he was carried away prisoner to Kenilworth  Castle, where he lay a considerable time, and was forced to purchase his  liberty at a dear rate.\"    A fight for the possession of Lord Spencer's house at Wormleighton was the  Saturday evening's prelude to the Sunday's battle. It had been garrisoned  by some Parliamentarian troops sent by Essex, and in Rupert's attack some  prisoners were taken, from whom, it is said, the whereabouts of the  Parliamentarian army was learned.[Y] The house is said to have been  partly burned down in the fight, but it is not clear whether it happened  then or in the year 1643. Though with the Parliamentarians in the early  part of the Rebellion, Lord Spencer became Royalist long ere the campaigns  were over. The fact of an outpost being pushed so far as Wormleighton  shows that the Dassett Hills were held by the Parliament forces. The  Royalists had marched into the heart of a hostile country, Warwick Castle  and Lord Brooke on the N.W., Fawsley House and the Knightleys on the N.E.,  and on the South, Sir A. Cope and Hanwell Castle, and Banbury and  Broughton Castle. Lord Northampton's lands on the Western border of  Oxfordshire were near enough to find touch with the King. His house played  locally a most prominent part for the Royalist cause, and its military  leadership was of the best.      III.    Early on the morning of Sunday, October 23rd, Prince Rupert forwarded  information to the King that the camp fires of the Parliamentarian army  had been seen on the plain between Edge Hill and Kineton. With keen  foresight Earl Lindsay abandoned the intended advance upon Banbury, and  speedily began the movement of the Royalist army towards the fringe of  hills which dominates the Warwickshire vale. It seems at first strange  that the Parliamentarians, familiar as so many of them were with the  physical features of the neighbourhood, should have neglected when so near  to secure possession of some part of the Edge Hill ridge. This, however,  is explained in a pamphlet of the time,[PH] \"An Exact and True Relation of  the Dangerous and Bloudy Fight between his Majestie's Army and the  Parliament near Keynton.\" Therein we learn that the artillery were  unready, for want of draught horses, and with Colonel Hampden and Colonel  Grantham were forced to be left behind, and hence no advance could safely  be made beyond Keynton.    Hampden had with him three regiments of foot, nine or ten troops of horse,  some companies of dragooners, and seven pieces of cannon, with the  necessary ammunition train,[PB] perhaps about 4,000 men in all. The troops  of the Parliament were quartered in the villages of the plain. Tradition  says that Tysoe was occupied, and that the soldiers took the bread from  the village ovens ere they marched down street to the fight. But of the  doings at Compton in the Hole, barely a mile distant, during the  occupation we know nothing.    It is hard also to understand that there should have been anything in the  nature of a surprise[B] in the Royalist advance, for within a district so  sympathetic to their cause, one would have supposed the Puritan leaders to  have been immediately informed of every movement of their enemies. Indeed,  in another quaint pamphlet, \"A Letter sent from a Worthy Divine,\"[PG] the  writer says that the alarm came at about eight o'clock in the morning,  that the enemy were advancing, and that \"it pleased God to make myself the  first instrument of giving a certain discovery of it, by the help of a  perspective glass, from the top a hill.\"    Deploying, therefore, before daybreak, across Cropredy Bridge, then  narrower than at present, and no doubt crossing the Cherwell at certain  fords also, the King's forces marched by way of Mollington to Warmington,  where they had been preceded by Prince Rupert's horse, who would have  travelled across the Southern part of the Dassett Hills. It is said[B]  that \"the foot were quartered at so great distance that many regiments  marched seven or eight miles to the rendezvous, so that it was past one of  the clock before the King's forces marched down hill.\" Much delay would be  occasioned in getting the troops across the river Cherwell, not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#2)"],[1,"hing;  for Thou hast appointed that man should from others guess much as to  himself; and believe much on the strength of weak females. Even then I  had being and life, and (at my infancy's close) I could seek for signs  whereby to make known to others my sensations. Whence could such a being  be, save from Thee, Lord? Shall any be his own artificer? or can there  elsewhere be derived any vein, which may stream essence and life into  us, save from thee, O Lord, in whom essence and life are one? for Thou  Thyself art supremely Essence and Life. For Thou art most high, and art  not changed, neither in Thee doth to-day come to a close; yet in Thee  doth it come to a close; because all such things also are in Thee. For  they had no way to pass away, unless Thou upheldest them. And since  Thy years fail not, Thy years are one to-day. How many of ours and  our fathers' years have flowed away through Thy \"to-day,\" and from it  received the measure and the mould of such being as they had; and still  others shall flow away, and so receive the mould of their degree of  being. But Thou art still the same, and all things of tomorrow, and all  beyond, and all of yesterday, and all behind it, Thou hast done to-day.  What is it to me, though any comprehend not this? Let him also rejoice  and say, What thing is this? Let him rejoice even thus! and be content  rather by not discovering to discover Thee, than by discovering not to  discover Thee.    Hear, O God. Alas, for man's sin! So saith man, and Thou pitiest him;  for Thou madest him, but sin in him Thou madest not. Who remindeth me of  the sins of my infancy? for in Thy sight none is pure from sin, not even  the infant whose life is but a day upon the earth. Who remindeth me?  doth not each little infant, in whom I see what of myself I remember  not? What then was my sin? was it that I hung upon the breast and cried?  for should I now so do for food suitable to my age, justly should I be  laughed at and reproved. What I then did was worthy reproof; but since  I could not understand reproof, custom and reason forbade me to be  reproved. For those habits, when grown, we root out and cast away. Now  no man, though he prunes, wittingly casts away what is good. Or was  it then good, even for a while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt?  bitterly to resent, that persons free, and its own elders, yea, the very  authors of its birth, served it not? that many besides, wiser than it,  obeyed not the nod of its good pleasure? to do its best to strike and  hurt, because commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its  hurt? The weakness then of infant limbs, not its will, is its innocence.  Myself have seen and known even a baby envious; it could not speak, yet  it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother. Who knows not  this? Mothers and nurses tell you that they allay these things by I know  not what remedies. Is that too innocence, when the fountain of milk  is flowing in rich abundance, not to endure one to share it, though  in extremest need, and whose very life as yet depends thereon? We bear  gently with all this, not as being no or slight evils, but because they  will disappear as years increase; for, though tolerated now, the very  same tempers are utterly intolerable when found in riper years.    Thou, then, O Lord my God, who gavest life to this my infancy,  furnishing thus with senses (as we see) the frame Thou gavest,  compacting its limbs, ornamenting its proportions, and, for its general  good and safety, implanting in it all vital functions, Thou commandest  me to praise Thee in these things, to confess unto Thee, and sing unto  Thy name, Thou most Highest. For Thou art God, Almighty and Good, even  hadst Thou done nought but only this, which none could do but Thou:  whose Unity is the mould of all things; who out of Thy own fairness  makest all things fair; and orderest all things by Thy law. This age  then, Lord, whereof I have no remembrance, which I take on others' word,  and guess from other infants that I have passed, true though the guess  be, I am yet loth to count in this life of mine which I live in this  world. For no less than that which I spent in my mother's womb, is it  hid from me in the shadows of forgetfulness. But if I was shapen in  iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me, where, I beseech Thee, O  my God, where, Lord, or when, was I Thy servant guiltless? But, lo! that  period I pass by; and what have I now to do with that, of which I can  recall no vestige?    Passing hence from infancy, I came to boyhood, or rather it came to me,  displacing infancy. Nor did that depart,--(for whither went it?)--and  yet it was no more. For I was no longer a speechless infant, but a  speaking boy. This I remember; and have since observed how I learned to  speak. It was not that my elders taught me words (as, soon after, other  learning) in any set method; but I, longing by cries and broken accents  and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts, that so I might  have my will, and yet unable to express all I willed, or to whom I  willed, did myself, by the understanding which Thou, my God, gavest me,  practise the sounds in my memory. When they named any thing, and as they  spoke turned towards it, I saw and remembered that they called what they  would point out by the name they uttered. And that they meant this  thing and no other was plain from the motion of their body, the natural  language, as it were, of all nations, expressed by the countenance,  glances of the eye, gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice,  indicating the affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses,  rejects, or shuns. And thus by constantly hearing words, as they  occurred in various sentences, I collected gradually for what they  stood; and having broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave  utterance to my will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current  signs of our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse  of human life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of  elders.    O God my God, what miseries and mockeries did I now experience, when  obedience to my teachers was proposed to me, as proper in a boy, in  order that in this world I might prosper, and excel in tongue-science,  which should serve to the \"praise of men,\" and to deceitful riches. Next  I was put to school to get learning, in which I (poor wretch) knew not  what use there was; and yet, if idle in learning, I was beaten. For this  was judged right by our forefathers; and many, passing the same course  before us, framed for us weary paths, through which we were fain to  pass; multiplying toil and grief upon the sons of Adam. But, Lord, we  found that men called upon Thee, and we learnt from them to think of  Thee (according to our powers) as of some great One, who, though hidden  from our senses, couldest hear and help us. For so I began, as a boy, to  pray to Thee, my aid and refuge; and broke the fetters of my tongue to  call on Thee, praying Thee, though small, yet with no small earnestness,  that I might not be beaten at school. And when Thou heardest me not (not  thereby giving me over to folly), my elders, yea my very parents, who  yet wished me no ill, mocked my stripes, my then great and grievous ill.    Is there, Lord, any of soul so great, and cleaving to Thee with so  intense affection (for a sort of stupidity will in a way do it); but  is there any one who, from cleaving devoutly to Thee, is endued with so  great a spirit, that he can think as lightly of the racks and hooks and  other torments (against which, throughout all lands, men call on Thee  with extreme dread), mocking at those by whom they are feared most  bitterly, as our parents mocked the torments which we suffered in  boyhood from our masters? For we feared not our torments less; nor  prayed we less to Thee to escape them. And yet we sinned, in writing or  reading or studying less than was exacted of us. For we wanted not, O  Lord, memory or capacity, whereof Thy will gave enough for our age; but  our sole delight was play; and for this we were punished by those who  yet themselves were doing the like. But elder folks' idleness is called  \"business\"; that of boys, being really the same, is punished by those  elders; and none commiserates either boys or men. For will any of sound  discretion approve of my being beaten as a boy, because, by playing a  ball, I made less progress in studies which I was to learn, only that,  as a man, I might play more unbeseemingly? and what else did he who beat  me? who, if worsted in some trifling discussion with his fellow-tutor,  was more embittered and jealous than I when beaten at ball by a  play-fellow?    And yet, I sinned herein, O Lord God, the Creator and Disposer of all  things in nature, of sin the Disposer only, O Lord my God, I sinned in  transgressing the commands of my parents and those of my masters. For  what they, with whatever motive, would have me learn, I might afterwards  have put to good use. For I disobeyed, not from a better choice, but  from love of play, loving the pride of victory in my contests, and to  have my ears tickled with lying fables, that they might itch the more;  the same curiosity flashing from my eyes more and more, for the shows  and games of my elders. Yet those who give these shows are in such  esteem, that almost all wish the same for their children, and yet are  very willing that they should be beaten, if those very games detain them  from the studies, whereby they would have them attain to be the givers  of them. Look with pity, Lord, on these things, and deliver us who call  upon Thee now; deliver those too who call not on Thee yet, that they may  call on Thee, and Thou mayest deliver them.      As a boy, then, I had already heard of an eternal life, promised  us through the humility of the Lord our God stooping to our pride; and  even from the womb of my mother, who greatly"]]]
