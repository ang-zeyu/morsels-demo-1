The fabrications, often quite clever, of the clearly insane,  which in earlier literature are confounded with pathological  lying, we have discriminated against as not being profitable for  us to discuss here, while not denying, however, the possibility  in some instances of lies coexisting with actual delusions.  We  well remember a patient, a brilliant conversationalist and letter  writer, but an absolutely frank case of paranoia, whom we had not  seen for a period during which she had concocted a new set of  notions involving even her own claim to royal blood, confronting  us with a merry, significant smile and the remark, ``You don't  believe my new stories, do you?''    A short statement on the relation of lying to delinquency may be  of interest here.  Ferriani's discussion[4] of the lying of 500  condemned juvenile offenders, with classification of their lies,  ranging from self-defense, weakness, and fancy, to nobility of  purpose, does not include our field.  Nor does he leave much room  for appreciation of the fact we very definitely have observed,  namely, that plenty of young offenders are robust speakers of the  truth.  Our analysis[5] of the delinquencies of 1000 young  repeated offenders carefully studied by us does not tell the  proportion of truth tellers as distinguished from liars, but it  does give the number in which lying was a notable and excessive  trait.  The total number of males studied was 694, of females  306.  Ages ranged from 6 to 22; average about 16 years.    [4] loc. cit.

It  would be safe to say that 8 or 10 of the 1000 were genuine cases  of pathological lying according to our definition, that 5 more  engaged in pathological false accusations without a notorious  career in other kinds of lying.  Examples of borderline mental  cases showing fantastic lying and accusations are given in our  special chapter.  Some of the cases of pathological lying given  in this work do not belong to the series of 1000 cases analyzed  for statistical purposes.  The extraordinary number of times  several of these individuals appeared in court (resembling in  this respect the European case histories) shows that the total  amount of trouble caused by this class is not in the least  represented by their numerical proportion among offenders.    We have purposely limited our own material for presentation.  Here, as elsewhere, we insist on the value of genetics and  consequently have busied ourselves at length with those cases  where we could gain something like an adequate conception of the  antecedents in family and developmental histories and where some  measure of the psychogenetic features could be taken.  Cases of  older individuals with their prolonged and often picturesque  careers, equivalent to those recounted in European literature, we  have left strictly alone.  One ever finds that the older the  individual the less one can learn satisfactorily of beginnings of  tendencies, just on account of the unreliability of the principal  actor in the drama.  The cases of older swindlers at first sight  seem to offer much for the student of criminalistics, if only for  purely descriptive purposes, but in the literature we have failed  to find any satisfactory studies of the formative years of such  careers.  By taking instances of younger pathological liars, such  as we have studied, the natural progress into swindling can be  readily seen.    In court work we have been brought face to face with many cases  of false accusation and, of course, with plenty of the usual kind  of lying.  Where either of these has been entered into by way of  revenge or in belief that it would aid in getting out of trouble,  no further attention has been paid to it from the standpoint of  pathological lying.  Our acquaintance with some professional  criminals, particularly of the sneak-thief or pick-pocket class,  has taught us that living conditions for the individual may be  founded on whole careers of misrepresentation and lies--for very  understandable reasons.  Self-accusations may sometimes be  evolved with the idea of gaining directly practical results, as  when a lover or a comrade is shielded, or when there is danger of  a larger crime being fastened on the self-incriminator.    In selection and treatment of our material we have confined  ourselves as closely as possible to the definition first given in  this chapter--a definition that after some years of observation  we found could be made and held to.  While we would not deny that  some of our cases may eventually find their way into an insane  hospital, still none of them, except some we have enumerated  under the name of border-line types, has so far shown any  indication of this.  That some of our cases have more or less  recovered from a strongly-marked and prolonged inclination to  falsify is a fact of great importance for treatment and  prognosis.    We see neither reason for including insane cases nor for  overlapping the already used classifications which are based on  more vital facts than the symptom of lying.  Our use of abnormal  cases in our chapter, ``Illustrations of Border-Line Types,''  will be perfectly clear to those who read these cases.  They  represent the material not easily diagnosed, sometimes after long  observation by professional people, or else they are clearly  abnormal individuals who, by the possession of certain  capacities, manage to keep their heads well above the level of  social incompetency as judged by the world at large.    We have introduced only the cases where we have had ample proof  that the individual had been given to excessive lying of our  peculiar type.  In the court room and working with delinquents  outside the court, it is in rare instances totally impossible to  know where the truth finally rests; such have been left out.  Then, too, we omit cases in which false accusations have about  them the shadow of even a suspicion of vindictiveness.  False  accusations of young children against parents would hardly seem  to have such a basis, and yet in some instances this fact has  come out clearly.  Grudge-formation on the part of young  individuals has all through our work been one of the  extraordinary findings; capacity for it varies tremendously in  different individuals.    Several forms of excessive lying, particularly those practised by  children and adolescents, are not discussed by us because they  are largely age phenomena and only verge upon the pathological as  they are carried over into wider fields of conduct.  The  fantasies of children, and the almost obsessional lying in some  young adolescents, too, we avoid.  There is much shading of  typical pathological lying into, on the one hand, the really  insane types, and, on the other hand, into the lying which is to  be explained by quite normal reactions or where the tendency to  mendacity is only partially developed.    It has been a matter of no small interest to us that in planning  this monograph we conceived it necessary to consider part of our  material under the head of episodic pathological lying and that  later we had to omit this chapter.  Surely there had been  cases--so it seemed to us at first--where purposeless lying had  been indulged in for a comparatively short time, particularly  during the adolescent period, without expression of a  prevaricating tendency before or after this time.  When we came  to review our material with this chapter in mind we found no  sufficient verification of the fact that there was any such thing  as episodic pathological lying, apart from peculiar  manifestations in cases of epilepsy, hysteria, and other mental  abnormalities.  A short career of extensive lying, not  unfrequently met with in work for juvenile courts and other  social agencies, seems, judging from our material, to be always  so mixed up with other delinquencies or unfortunate sex  experiences that the lying, after all, cannot be regarded as  purposeless.  It is indulged in most often in an attempt to  disguise undesirable truths.  That false accusations and even  self-accusations are engaged in for the same purpose goes without  saying.  The girl who donned man's clothes, left home and lived  for months a life of lies was seeking an adventure which would  offset intolerable home conditions.  The young woman who after  seeing something of the pleasures of the world was placed in a  strict religious home where she told exaggerated stories about  her own bad behavior, was endeavoring to get more freedom  elsewhere.  A young fellow whom we found to be a most persistent  and consistent liar was discovered to have been already well  schooled in the art of professional criminalistic  self-protection.  So it has gone.  Investigation of each of these  episodic cases has shown the fabrications to emanate either from  a distinctly abnormal personality or to partake of a character  which rules them out of the realm of pathological lying.  In our  cases of temporary adolescent psychoses lying was rarely found a  puzzling feature; the basic nature of the case was too easily  discoverable.    A fair question to ask at this point is whether pathological  lying is ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44941"],[0,"The Government of God (#2)"],[1,"here let me remark how different is this to the works of man.  We see, then, the power of God manifested in their preservation  and guidance; but when we reflect a little further, that while our  planetary system rolls in perfect order round the sun, there are other  systems which perform their revolutions round their suns; and the whole  of these, our system with its centre, and other systems with their  centres, roll round another grand centre: and the whole of those, and  innumerable others, equally as great, stupendous, and magnificent, roll  round another more great, glorious, and resplendent, till numbers,  magnificence, and glory, drown the thought, we are led to exclaim  with the prophet, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and  knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgements, and His ways  past finding out!\" Romans xi. 33. Without referring again to the  motions of our earth, and the beautiful regularity and precision of the  whole of this elegant machinery, we will turn our attention a little to  the works of creation as found on the earth. The make, construction,  and adaptation of each for its proper sphere, are the work of God; and  they are all controlled by His wisdom and power, independent of man. In  the conformation of the birds, the beasts, the fishes, the reptiles,  the grains, herbs, plants, and trees, we see a striking exemplification  of this fact. No matter which way we turn our attention, the same  order and intelligence are displayed. The fish in their organization  are peculiarly adapted to their proper element; the birds and beasts  to theirs; the amphibious animals to theirs. The nicely organized  machinery of their bodies; their bones, muscles, skins, feathers,  scales, or hair; the formation of their bodies, their manner of living,  together with the nature of their food, and their particular adaptation  to the various elements and climates which they occupy, are all so many  marked evidences of skill, forethought, intelligence and power. We will  here notice a few examples. Plunge bird, beast, or man, into the water,  and let them remain there, and they will soon die; take a fish out of  the water, and death ensues; yet all are happy, and move with perfect  enjoyment in their proper spheres. Elevate a man, beast, or fish, into  the air, and let them fall, and they will be bruised to death; but the  bird, with its wings, light bones, and fragile body, is peculiarly  adapted to the aerial element in which it moves, and is perfectly at  home; while the brute creation and men feel as much so on the earth.  Again, their habits, food, coatings, or coverings, digestive powers,  and the organization of their systems, are all peculiarly adapted to  their several situations. The same principle is developed in their  arrangement and position on the earth. Those that inhabit a southern  climate are peculiarly adapted to that situation; while those that  inhabit a northern are equally fitted for theirs.    Take the reindeer and polar bear to the torrid zone, and they would  be out of their proper latitude, and would probably die. Remove the  elephant, lion, or tiger, to Iceland or Greenland, and leave them to  their own resources, and they would inevitably perish.    We will notice for a moment the construction of their systems. Each  one is possessed with muscular strength, or agility, according to  its position, wants, or dangers, and there is a beauty, a symmetry,  and a perfection about all God's works, which baffle and defy human  intelligence to copy. An artist is considered talented if he can make,  after years of toil, a striking likeness of any of those things,  either on canvas, or in marble. But when he has done, it is only a  dead outline; remove a little paint, or tear the canvas, and its  beauty is destroyed; break the arm of a statue, and we see nothing  but a mutilated stone. But take a man, for example, and remove the  skin, there is still order and beauty; remove the flesh, there is  still workmanship and skill, and the bones, the flesh, the muscles,  the arteries and veins, and the nerves, and the lungs, not to forget  the exquisite fineness of the sensitive organs, manifesting a skill, a  forethought, a wisdom, and a power, as much above that of man as the  heavens are above the earth.    We see the power, wisdom, and government of God, displayed in the  amazing strength of some of the largest of the brute creation; as  also in the fineness and delicacy, of the arrangement of the smaller.  And while we admire the stupendous power of the elephant, we are  equally struck with the fineness, delicacy, and beauty of some of the  smaller insects. The prescience, and intelligence of God, are as much  manifested in arranging the bones, muscles, arteries, and digestive  organs of the smallest animaculae, as in the construction of the horse,  rhinoceros, elephant, or whale. I might touch upon the organization of  plants, herbs, trees, and fruits; their various compositions, modes  of nourishment, manner of propagating their kind, &c.; but enough  has already been said upon this subject. It is one that no one will  dispute upon; Jew and Gentile, black and white, Christian and Heathen,  philosopher and fool, all have one faith on this subject.    I have briefly touched upon it for the purpose of presenting in a  clear light the imbecility and weakness of man; for wherever we turn  our attention, we see power, wisdom, prescience, order, forethought,  beauty, grandeur and magnificence.    These are the works of God, and shew His skill, workmanship, glory, and  intelligence. They reflect His divine power, and shew in unmistakeable  characters the wisdom of his government, and the order that prevails in  that part of creation over which He has the sole and unlimited control.    We can perceive very clearly that what God has done, is rightly done.  It is not governed by instability and disorder, but continues from  eternity to eternity to bear the impress of Jehovah.        Chapter II.  ------------------    The Government of Man.    We will now turn our attention a little to the government of man, and  see how that will compare with the foregoing, for man stands at the  head of this beautiful creation; he is endued with intelligence and  capacity for improvement; he is placed as a moral agent, and has the  materials put into his hands to work with, the works of his Father  as a pattern, the conduct of many of the inferior creation as an  example--and might make the earth a garden, a paradise, a place of  uninterrupted happiness and felicity, a heaven below. And if God had  not delegated this moral agency and power to man, and thus given him  the privilege, in part, of being the arbiter of his own destiny, such  it would have been to this day, like the Eden from which he was ejected  because of his transgression. For he had everything placed within his  power, and was made lord of the creation. The beasts, birds, fish,  and fowl, were placed under his control; the earth yielded plenty for  his wants, and abounded in fruits, grain, herbs, flowers and trees,  both to satisfy his hunger, and to please the sight, taste, and smell.  The fields waved with plenty, and produced a perennial harvest. The  fruits teemed forth in all their luscious varieties to satisfy his  most capacious desires. The flowers, in all their gaiety, beauty,  and richness, delighted the eye; while their rich fragrance filled  the air with odoriferous perfumes. The feathered tribes, with all  their gorgeous plumage and variety of song, both pleased the eye, and  enchanted and charmed the ear. The horse, the cow, and other animals,  were there to promote his happiness, supply his wants, and make him  comfortable and happy. All were under his control, to contribute to his  happiness and comfort, supply his most extended desires, and to add to  his enjoyment; but with all these privileges what is his situation?    With celestial blessings within his reach, he has plunged down to the  very verge of hell, and is found in a state of poverty, confusion, and  distress. He found the earth an Eden--a paradise; he has filled it with  misery and woe, and has made it comparatively a howling wilderness. And  let us not blame Adam alone for this state of things; for after his  ejection from Paradise, the earth was sufficiently fertile to satisfy  all the desires of man with moderate industry, and is at the present  day, if it were not for the confusion that exists, and if men were  properly situated, and its resources developd. But more of this anon.    At present we will examine some of these evils, and then point out  their cause, and the remedy.    We find the world split up and divided into different nations, having  different interests, and different objects; with their religious and  political views as dissimilar as light and darkness, all the time  jealous of each other, and watching each other as so many thieves;  and that man at the present day (and it has been the case for ages),  is considered the greatest statesman, who, with legislation or  diplomacy, can make the most advantageous arrangement with, or coerce  by circumstances, other nations into measures that would be for the  benefit of the nation with which he is associated. No matter how  injurious it might be to the nation or nations concerned, the measure  that would yield his nation an advantage, might plunge another in  irremediable misery, while there is no one to act as father and parent  of the whole, and God is lost sight of. What is it that the private  ambition of man has not done to satisfy his craving desires for the  acquisition of territory and wealth, and what is falsely called _honor_  and _fame_?    Those private, jarring interests have kept the world in one continual  ferment and commotion from the commencement until the present time;  and the history of the world is a history of the rise and fall of  nations--of wars, commotions,"]]]
