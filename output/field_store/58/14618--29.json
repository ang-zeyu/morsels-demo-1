At God's bidding the avalanche fell. No precaution could  save the traveler who was in its path. He was instantly borne to  destruction, and buried where no voice but the archangel's trump  could ever reach his ear. Terrific storms of wind and snow often  swept through those bleak altitudes, blinding and smothering the  traveler. Hundreds of bodies, like pillars of ice, embalmed in  snow, are now sepulchred in those drifts, there to sleep till the  fires of the last conflagration shall have consumed their winding  sheet. Having toiled two days through such scenes of desolation  and peril, the adventurous traveler stands upon the summit of the  pass, eight thousand feet above the level of the sea, two thousand  feet higher than the crest of Mount Washington, our own mountain  monarch. This summit, over which the path winds, consists of a  small level plain, surrounded by mountains of snow of still higher  elevation.    The scene here presented is inexpressibly gloomy and appailing.  Nature in these wild regions assumes her most severe and sombre  aspect. As one emerges from the precipitous and craggy ascent,  upon this Valley of Desolation, as it is emphatically called, the  Convent of St. Bernard presents itself to the view. This cheerless  abode, the highest spot of inhabited ground in Europe, has been  tenanted, for more than a thousand years, by a succession of joyless  and self-denying monks, who, in that frigid retreat of granite and  ice, endeavor to serve their Maker, by rescuing bewildered travelers  from the destruction with which they are ever threatened to be  overwhelmed by the storms, which battle against them. In the middle  of this ice-bound valley, lies a lake, clear, dark, and cold, whose  depths, even in mid-summer, reflect the eternal glaciers which soar  sublimely around. The descent to the plains of Italy is even more  precipitous and dangerous than the ascent from the green pastures  of France. No vegetation adorns these dismal and storm-swept cliffs  of granite and of ice. Even the pinion of the eagle fails in its  rarified air, and the chamois ventures not to climb its steep and  slippery crags. No human beings are ever to be seen on these bleak  summits, except the few shivering travelers, who tarry for an hour  to receive the hospitality of the convent, and the hooded monks,  wrapped in thick and coarse garments, which their staves and their  dogs, groping through the storms of sleet and snow. Even the wood  which burns with frugal faintness on the hearths, is borne, in  painful burdens, up the mountain sides, upon the shoulders of the  monks.    Such was the barrier which Napoleon intended to surmount, that  he might fall upon the rear of the Austrians, who were battering  down the walls of Genoa, where Massena was besieged, and who were  thundering, flushed with victory, at the very gates of Nice. Over  this wild mountain pass, where the mule could with difficulty  tread, and where no wheel had ever rolled, or by any possibility  could roll, Napoleon contemplated transporting an army of sixty  thousand men, with ponderous artillery and tons of cannon balls,  and baggage, and all the bulky munitions of war. England and Austria  laughed the idea to scorn. The achievement of such an enterprise  was apparently impossible. Napoleon, however was as skillful in  the arrangement of the minutest details, as in the conception of  the grandest combinations. Though he resolved to take the mass of  his army, forty thousand strong, across the pass of the Great St.  Bernard, yet to distract the attention of the Austrians, he arranged  also to send small divisions across the passes of Saint Gothard,  Little St. Bernard, and Mount Cenis. He would thus accumulate  suddenly, and to the utter amazement of the enemy, a body of sixty-five  thousand men upon the plain of Italy. This force, descending, like  an apparition from the clouds, in the rear of the Austrian army,  headed by Napoleon, and cutting off all communication with Austria,  might indeed strike a panic into the hearts of the assailants of  France.    The troops were collected in various places in the vicinity  of Dijon, ready at a moment's warning to assemble at the point of  rendezvous, and with a rush to enter the defile. Immense magazines  of wheat, biscuit, and oats had been noiselessly collected in  different places. Large sums of specie had been forwarded, to hire  the services of every peasant, with his mule, who inhabited the  valleys among the mountains. Mechanic shops, as by magic, suddenly  rose along the path, well supplied with skillful artisans, to repair  all damages, to dismount the artillery, to divide the gun-carriages  and the baggage-wagons into fragments, that they might be transported,  on the backs of men and mules, over the steep and rugged way. For  the ammunition a vast number of small boxes were prepared, which  could easily be packed upon the mules. A second company of mechanics,  with camp forges, had been provided to cross the mountain with the  first division, and rear their shops upon the plain on the other  side, to mend the broken harness, to reconstruct the carriages,  and remount the pieces. On each side of the mountain a hospital  was established and supplied with every comfort for the sick and  the wounded. The foresight of Napoleon extended even to sending,  at the very last moment, to the convent upon the summit, an immense  quantity of bread, cheese, and wine. Each soldier, to his surprise,  was to find, as he arrived at the summit, exhausted with Herculean  toil, a generous slice of bread and cheese with a refreshing cup  of wine, presented to him by the monks. All these minute details  Napoleon arranged, while at the same time he was doing the work  of a dozen energetic men, in reorganizing the whole structure of  society in France. If toil pays for greatness, Napoleon purchased  the renown which he attained. And yet his body and his mind were  so constituted that this sleepless activity was to him a pleasure.    The appointed hour at last arrived. On the 7th of May, 1800,  Napoleon entered his carriage at the Tuileries, saying, \"Good-by,  my dear Josephine! I must go to Italy. I shall not forget you, and  I will not be absent long.\" At a word, the whole majestic array  was in motion. Like a meteor he swept over France. He arrived at  the foot of the mountains. The troops and all the paraphernalia of  war were on the spot at the designated hour. Napoleon immediately  appointed a very careful inspection. Every foot soldier and every  horseman passed before his scrutinizing eye. If a shoe was ragged,  or a jacket torn, or a musket injured, the defect was immediately  repaired. His glowing words inspired the troops with the ardor  which was burning in his own bosom. The genius of the First Consul  was infused into the mighty host. Each man exerted himself to the  utmost. The eye of their chief was every where, and his cheering  voice roused the army to almost super-human exertions. Two skillful  engineers had been sent to explore the path, and to do what could  be done in the removal of obstructions. They returned with an  appalling recitasl of the apparently insurmountable difficulties  of the way. \"Is it possible ,\" inquired Napoleon, \"to cross the  pass?\" \"Perhaps,\" was the hesitating reply, \"it is within the limits  of possibility .\" \"Forward, then,\" was the energetic response.  Each man was required to carry, besides his arms, food for several  days and a large quantity of cartridges. As the sinuosities of  the precipitous path could only be trod in single file, the heavy  wheels were taken from the carriages, and each, slung upon a pole,  was borne by two men. The task for the foot soldiers was far less  than for the horsemen. The latter clambered up on foot, dragging  their horses after them. The descent was very dangerous. The  dragoon, in the steep and narrow path, was compelled to walk before  his horse. At the least stumble he was exposed to being plunged  headlong into the abysses yawning before him. In this way many  horses and several riders perished. To transport the heavy cannon  and howitzers pine logs were split in the centre, the parts hollowed  out, and the guns sunks into grooves. A long string of mules, in  single file, were attached to the ponderous machines of war, to  drag them up the slippery ascent. The mules soon began to fail, and  then the men, with hearty good-will, brought their own shoulders into  the harness--a hundred men to a single gun. Napoleon offered the  peasants two hundred dollars for the transporation of a twelve-pounder  over the pass. The love of gain was not strong enough to lure them  to such tremendous exertions. But Napoleon's fascination over the  hearts of his soldiers was a more powerful impulse. With shouts  of encouragement they toiled at the cables, successive bands of  a hundred men relieving each other every half hour. High on those  craggy steeps, gleaming through the midst, the glittering bands of  armed men, like phantoms appeared. The eagle wheeled and screamed  beneath their feet. The mountain goat, affrighted by the unwonted  spectacle, bounded away, and paused in bold relief upon the cliff  to gaze upon the martial array which so suddenly had peopled the  solitude.    When they approached any spot of very especial difficulty the trumpets  sounded the charge, which re-echoed, with sublime reverberations,  from pinnacle to pinnacle of rock and ice. Animated by these bugle  notes the soldiers strained every nerve as if rushing upon the  foe. Napoleon offered to these bands the same reward which he had  promised to the peasants. But to a man, they refused the gold.  They had imbibed the spirit of their chief, his enthusiasm, and  his proud superiority to all mercenary motives. \"We are not toiling  for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#2)"],[1," with him, and that was why he sold it to Tom. The two thus became  acquainted, and their friendship grew from year to year.    After many adventures on his motor-cycle Tom got a motor-boat, and  had some exciting times in that. One of the things he and his father  and his chum, Ned Newton, did, was to rescue, from a burning balloon  that had fallen into Lake Carlopa, an aeronaut named John Sharp.  Later Tom and Mr. Sharp built an airship called the Red Cloud, and  with Mr. Damon and some others had a series of remarkable fights.    In the Red Cloud they got on the track of some bank robbers, and  captured them, thus foiling the plans of Andy Foger, a town bully,  and one of Tom's enemies, and putting to confusion the plot of Mr.  Foger, Andy's father.    After many adventures in the air Tom and his friends, in a submarine  boat, invented by Mr. Swift, went under the ocean for sunken  treasure and secured a large part of it.    It was not long after this that Tom conceived the idea of a powerful  electric car, which proved, to be the speediest of the road, and in  it he won a great race, and saved from ruin a bank in which his  father and Mr. Damon were interested.    The sixth book of the series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Wireless  Message,\" tells how, in testing a new electric airship, which a  friend of Mr. Damon's had invented, Tom, the inventor and Mr. Damon  were lost on an island in the middle of the ocean. There they found  some castaways, among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Nestor, parents of Mary  Nestor of Shopton, a girl of whom Tom was quite fond.    Tom Swift, after his arrival home, went on an expedition among a  gang of men known as the \"Diamond Makers\" who were hidden in the  Rocky Mountains. He was accompanied by Mr. Barcoe Jenks, one of the  castaways of Earthquake Island. They found the diamond makers, and  had some surprising adventures, barely escaping with their lives.    This did not daunt Tom, however, and he once more started off on an  expedition in his airship the Red Cloud to Alaska, amid the caves of  ice. He was searching for a valley of gold, and though he and his  friends found it, they came to grief. The Fogers, father and son,  tried to steal the gold from them, and, failing in that, incited the  Eskimos against our friends. There was a battle, but the forces of  nature were even more to be dreaded than the terrible savages.    The ice cave, in which the Red Cloud was stored, collapsed, crushing  the gallant craft, and burying it out of sight forever under  thousand of tons of the frozen bergs.    After a desperate journey Tom and his friends reached civilization,  with a large supply of gold. Tom regretted very much the destruction  of the airship, but he at once set to work on another--a monoplane  this time, instead of a combined aeroplane and dirigible balloon.  This new craft he called the Humming-Bird and it was a \"sky racer\"  of terrific speed. In it, as we have said, Tom brought a specialist  to operate on his father, when, because of a broken railroad bridge,  the physician could not otherwise have gotten to Shopton. He and Tom  traveled through the air at the rate of over one hundred miles an  hour. Later, Tom took part in a big race for a ten-thousand-dollar  prize, and won, defeating Andy Foger, and a number of well-known  \"bird-men\" who used biplanes and monoplanes of a more or less  familiar type.    The government became interested in Tom's craft, the Humming-Bird,  and, as told in the ninth book of this series, Tom Swift and His Sky  Racer, they secured some rights in the invention.    And now Tom, who had done nothing for several months following the  great race--that is, nothing save to work on his new rifle--Tom, we  say, sighed for new adventures.    \"Well, Tom, what is on your mind?\" asked his father at the supper  table that evening. \"What is worrying you?\"    \"Nothing is worrying me, Dad.\"    \"You are thinking of something. I can see that. Are you afraid your  electric rifle won't work as well as you hope, when Ned comes over  to try it?\"    \"No, it isn't that, Dad. But I may as well tell you, I guess. I've  been reading in the paper about a big elephant hunt in Africa, and  I--\"    \"That's enough, Tom! You needn't say any more,\" interrupted Mr.  Swift. \"I can see which way the wind is blowing. You want to go to  Africa with your new rifle.\"    \"Well, Dad, not exactly--that is--\"    \"Now, Tom, you needn't deny it,\" and Mr. Swift laughed. \"Well, I  don't blame you a bit. You have been rather idle of late.\"    \"I would like to go, Dad,\" admitted the young inventor, \"only I'd  never think of it while you weren't well.\"    \"Don't worry about me, Tom. Of course I will be lonesome while you  are gone, but don't let that stand in the way. If you want to go to  Africa, you may start to-morrow, and take your new rifle with you.\"    \"The rifle part would be all right, Dad, but if I went I'd want to  take an airship along, and it will take me some little time to  finish the Black Hawk, as I have named my new craft.\"    \"Well, there's no special hurry, is there?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"The  elephants in Africa are likely to stay there for some time. If you  want to go, why don't you get right to work on the Black Hawk and  make the trip? I'd like to go myself.\"    \"I wish you would, Dad,\" exclaimed Tom eagerly.    \"No, son, I couldn't think of it. I want to stay here and get well.  Then I am going to resume work on my wireless motor. Perhaps I'll  have it finished when you come back from Africa with an airship load  of elephants' tusks.\"    \"Perhaps,\" admitted the young inventor. \"Well, Dad, I'll think of  it. But now I'm going after my rifle, and--\"    Tom was interrupted by a ring of the front-door bell, and Mrs.  Baggert, the housekeeper, who was almost like a mother to the youth,  went to answer it.    \"It's Ned Newton, I guess,\" murmured Tom, and, a little later, his  chum entered the room.    \"Oh, I guess I'm early,\" said Ned. \"Haven't you had supper yet,  Tom?\"    \"Yes, we're just finished. Come on out and we'll try the gun.\"    \"And practice shooting elephants,\" added Mr. Swift with a laugh, as  he mentioned to Ned the latest idea of Tom.    \"Say! That would be great!\" cried the bank clerk. \"I wish I could  go!\"    \"Come along!\" invited Tom cordially. \"We'll have more fun than we  did in the caves of ice,\" for Ned had gone on the voyage to Alaska.    The two youths went out to the shed where the rifle gallery had been  built. The new electric weapon was out there, and Eradicate Sampson,  the colored man, who was a sort of servant and man-of-all-work about  the Swift household, had set up the scarecrow figure at the end of  the gallery.    \"Now we'll try some shots,\" said Tom, as he took the gun out of the  case. \"Just turn on a few more lights, will you, Mr. Jackson,\" and  the engineer, who was employed by Tom and his father to aid them in  their inventive work, did as requested.    The gallery was now brilliantly illuminated, with the reflectors  throwing the beams on the big stuffed figure, which, save for a  face, looked very much like a human being, standing at the end of  the gallery.    \"I don't suppose you want to go down there and hold it, while I  shoot at it; do you, Rad?\" asked Tom jokingly, as he prepared the  electric rifle for use.    \"No indeedy, I don't!\" cried Eradicate. \"Yo'-all will hab t' scuse  me, Massa Tom. I think I'll be goin' now.\"    \"What's your hurry?\" asked Ned, as he saw the colored man hastily  preparing to leave the improvised gallery.    \"I spects I'd better fro' down some mo' straw fo' a bed fo' my mule  Boomerang!\" exclaimed Eradicate, as he hastily slid out of the door,  and shut it after him.    \"Rad is nervous,\" remarked Tom. \"He doesn't like this gun. Well, it  certainly does great execution.\"    \"How does it work'\" asked Ned, as he looked at the curious gun. The  electric weapon was not unlike an ordinary heavy rifle in appearance  save that the barrel was a little longer, and the stock larger in  every way. There were also a number of wheels, levers, gears and  gages on the stock.    \"It works by electricity,\" explained Tom.    \"That is, the force comes from a powerful current of stored  electricity.\"    \"Oh, then you have storage batteries in the stock?\"    \"Not exactly. There are no batteries, but the current is a sort of  wireless kind. It is stored in a cylinder, just as compressed air or  gases are stored, and can be released as I need it.\"    \"And when it's all gone, what do you do?\"    \"Make more power by means of a small dynamo.\"    \"And does it shoot lead bullets?\"    \"Not at all. There are no bullets used.\"    \"Then how does it kill?\"    \"By means of a concentrated charge of electricity which is shot from  the barrel with great force. You can't see it, yet it is there. It's  just as if you concentrated a charge of electricity of five thousand  volts into a small globule the size of a bullet. That flies through  space, strikes the object aimed at and--well, we'll see what it does  in a minute. Mr. Jackson, just put that steel plate up in front of  the scarecrow; will you?\"    The engineer proceeded to put into place a section of steel armor-plate  before the stuffed figure.    \"You don't mean to say you're going to shoot through that, do you?\"  asked Ned in surprise.    \"Surely. The electric bullets will pierce anything. They'll go  through a brick wall as easily as the x-rays do. That's one valuable  feature of my rifle. You don't have to see the object you aim at. In  fact you can fire through a house, and kill something on the other  side.\"    \"I should think that would be dangerous.\"    \"It would be, only I can calculate exactly, by means of an automatic  arrangement, just how far the charge of electricity will go. It  stops short just at the limit of the range, and is not effective  beyond that. Otherwise, if I did not limit it and if I fired at the  scarecrow, through the piece of steel, and the bullet hit"]]]
