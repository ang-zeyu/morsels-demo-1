Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.  We've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get  home again.\"    The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked  thoughtful.  Then he started to say something to his little companion,  but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side  to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them.  Next minute there  was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground  open in a wide crack and then come together again.    \"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat.  \"What was  that?\"    \"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face.  \"It  almost got us that time, Dorothy.\"    The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.  Zeb shook the  reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn.  Then the boy cracked  his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan  of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.    Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes.  There was a  breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would  shake violently.  Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and  every muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home.  He  was not going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to  appear and at times he would tremble like a leaf.    The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds  as it swept over the valley.    Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into  another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.  With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit,  drawing the buggy and its occupants after him.    Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same.  The sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.    Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they  waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for  the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its  dreadful depths.    The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying  noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the  little girl lost consciousness.  Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but  he was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,  expecting every moment would be his last.          2.  The Glass City      When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so  fast.  The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an  umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated  downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to  bear.  The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this  great crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was  about to overtake them at any moment.  Crash after crash echoed far  above their heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and  stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side.  These  they could not see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and  Jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and  struck his boney body.  They did not really hurt the poor horse,  because everything was falling together; only the stones and rubbish  fell faster than the horse and buggy, which were held back by the  pressure of the air, so that the terrified animal was actually more  frightened than he was injured.    How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,  she was so greatly bewildered.  But bye and bye, as she stared ahead  into the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the  form of the horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his  long legs sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space.  Also, turning her head, she found that she could see the boy beside  her, who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself.    Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.  She began to realize  that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely  started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and  unusual as were those she had before encountered.    With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over  the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.  Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.  The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.  Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five  brilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one  blue and one orange.  This splendid group of colored suns sent rays  darting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy  and Zeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays  began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more  and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly  illuminated.    Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big  ears turn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail  should be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the  stripes of a zebra.  Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and  whose hair was pink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.    \"Isn't it funny?\" she said.    The boy was startled and his eyes were big.  Dorothy had a green streak  through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came  together, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.    \"I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!\" he stammered.    Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the  horse tipping also.  But they continued to fall, all together, and the  boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they  were before.  Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll  slowly over until they were right side up again.  During this time Jim  struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding  himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of  voice:    \"Well, that's better!\"    Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.    \"Can your horse talk?\" she asked.    \"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.    \"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had  overheard them, \"and I can't explain why I happened to speak then.  This is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?\"    \"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,  cheerfully.  \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"    \"Of course,\" growled the horse, \"and then we shall be sorry it  happened.\"    Zeb gave a shiver.  All this was so terrible and unreal that he could  not understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.    Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close  beside them.  The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,  and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.  There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had  passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing  rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.    \"We've got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep  sigh.  \"We can't keep falling forever, you know.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy.  \"We are somewhere in the middle of the  earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before  long.  But it's a big hollow, isn't it?\"    \"Awful big!\" answered the boy.    \"We're coming to something now,\" announced the horse.    At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked  down.  Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away,  either.  But they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it  could no longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to  take heart and look about them.    They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very  like those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly  colored by the variegated lights from the six suns.  Here and there  were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they  sparkled so brightly.    \"I'm sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice.  \"We  are falling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land,  and this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"    \"We'll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan.    \"Oh, I'm not so sure of that,\" replied the girl.  \"But don't let us  worry over such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you  know, and I've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.\"    The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and  soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread  out below them.  They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a  big city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and  sharp-pointed spires.  These spires were like great spear-points, and  if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious  injury.    Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight  up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense.  But no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a  stop at last.    When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs  trembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#2)"],[1,"grains have been worn  and rounded. They are sorted also, those of each layer being about  of a size. By some means they have been brought hither from some  more ancient source. Surely these grains have had a history before  they here found a resting place,--a history which we are to learn  to read.    The successive layers of the rock suggest that they were built one  after another from the bottom upward. We may be as sure that each  layer was formed before those above it as that the bottom courses  of stone in a wall were laid before the courses which rest upon  them.    We have no reason to believe that the lowest layers which we see  here were the earliest ever formed. Indeed, some deep boring in  the vicinity may prove that the ledges rest upon other layers of  rock which extend downward for many hundreds of feet below the  valley floor. Nor may we conclude that the highest layers here  were the latest ever laid; for elsewhere we may find still later  layers lying upon them.    A short search may find in the rock relics of animals, such as the  imprints of shells, which lived when it was deposited; and as  these are of kinds whose nearest living relatives now have their  home in the sea, we infer that it was on the flat sea floor that  the sandstone was laid. Its present position hundreds of feet  above sea level proves that it has since emerged to form part of  the land; while the flatness of the beds shows that the movement  was so uniform and gentle as not to break or strongly bend them  from their original attitude.    The surface of some of these layers is ripple-marked. Hence the  sand must once have been as loose as that of shallow sea bottoms  and sea beaches to-day, which is thrown into similar ripples by  movements of the water. In some way the grains have since become  cemented into firm rock.    Note that the layers on one side of the valley agree with those on  the other, each matching the one opposite at the same level. Once  they were continuous across the valley. Where the valley now is  was once a continuous upland built of horizontal layers; the  layers now show their edges, or OUTCROP, on the valley sides  because they have been cut by the valley trench.    The rock of the ledges is crumbling away. At the foot of each step  of rock lie fragments which have fallen. Thus the valley is slowly  widening. It has been narrower in the past; it will be wider in  the future.    Through the valley runs a stream. The waters of rains which have  fallen on the upper parts of the stream's basin are now on their  way to the river and the sea. Rock fragments and grains of sand  creeping down the valley slopes come within reach of the stream  and are washed along by the running water. Here and there they  lodge for a time in banks of sand and gravel, but sooner or later  they are taken up again and carried on. The grains of sand which  were brought from some ancient source to form these rocks are on  their way to some new goal. As they are washed along the rocky bed  of the stream they slowly rasp and wear it deeper. The valley will  be deeper in the future; it has been less deep in the past.    In this little valley we see slow changes now in progress. We find  also in the composition, the structure, and the attitude of the  rocks, and the land forms to which they have been sculptured, the  record of a long succession of past changes involving the origin  of sand grains and their gathering and deposit upon the bottom of  some ancient sea, the cementation of their layers into solid rock,  the uplift of the rocks to form a land surface, and, last of all,  the carving of a valley in the upland. Everywhere, in the fields,  along the river, among the mountains, by the seashore, and in the  desert, we may discover slow changes now in progress and the  record of similar changes in the past. Everywhere we may catch  glimpses of a process of gradual change, which stretches backward  into the past and forward into the future, by which the forms and  structures of the face of the earth are continually built and  continually destroyed. The science which deals with this long  process is geology. Geology treats of the natural changes now  taking place upon the earth and within it, the agencies which  produce them, and the land forms and rock structures which result.  It studies the changes of the present in order to be able to read  the history of the earth's changes in the past.    The various agencies which have fashioned the face of the earth  may. be divided into two general classes. In Part I we shall  consider those which work upon the earth from without, such as the  weather, running water, glaciers, the wind, and the sea. In Part  II we shall treat of those agencies whose sources are within the  earth, and among whose manifestations are volcanoes and  earthquakes and the various movements of the earth's crust. As we  study each agency we shall notice not only how it does its work,  but also the records which it leaves in the rock structures and  the land forms which it produces. With this preparation we shall  be able in Part III to read in the records of the rocks the  history of our planet and the successive forms of life which have  dwelt upon it.            PART I    EXTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES    CHAPTER I    THE WORK OF THE WEATHER      In our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed  a process which is going forward in all lands. Everywhere the  rocks are crumbling away; their fragments are creeping down  hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the  sea, where they are rebuilt into rocky layers. When again the  rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew; again  they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams  to the sea. Let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at  the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of  the weather. In studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall  learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away.    STRATIFICATION AND JOINTING. At the sandstone ledges we saw that  the rock was divided into parallel layers. The thicker layers are  known as STRATA, and the thin leaves into which each stratum may  sometimes be split are termed LAMINAE. To a greater or less degree  these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain, showing  that the material has been sorted. The planes which divide them  are called BEDDING PLANES.    Besides the bedding planes there are other division planes, which  cut across the strata from top to bottom. These are found in all  rocks and are known as joints. Two sets of joints,  running at about right angles to each other, together with the  bedding planes, divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks.    SANDSTONE. Examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of  grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches. Most of  the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz. These  quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife  blade. They are not affected by acid, and their broken surfaces  are irregular like those of broken glass.    The grains of sandstone are held together by some cement. This may  be calcareous, consisting of soluble carbonate of lime. In brown  sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous,--hydrated iron  oxide, or iron rust, forming the bond, somewhat as in the case of  iron nails which have rusted together. The strongest and most  lasting cement is siliceous, and sand rocks whose grains are  closely cemented by silica, the chemical substance of which quartz  is made, are known as quartzites.    We are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the  action of the weather. On ledges where the rock is exposed to view  its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose  and may be rubbed off with the finger. On gentle slopes the rock  is covered with a soil composed of sand, which evidently is  crumbled sandstone, and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the  decay of vegetation. Clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement  that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand. A piece of sandstone  with calcareous cement, or a bit of old mortar, which is really an  artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime, may be  treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the  process.    A LIMESTONE QUARRY. Here also we find the rock stratified and  jointed (Fig. 2). On the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen  to be altered for some distance from its upper surface. Below the  altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building; but  the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for  this purpose. If the limestone is laminated, the laminae here have  split apart, although below they hold fast together. Near the  surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch,  while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of  limestone meal, on which rests a fine reddish clay.    Limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly  held together by a calcareous cement. A piece of the stone placed  in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk  effervescence, leaving the insoluble impurities, which were  disseminated through it, at the bottom of the tube as a little  clay.    We can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the  quarry. At the surface of the rock the limestone has completely  dissolved, leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish  clay. Immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into  meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been  removed, while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the  cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination  where the stone is more porous. As these changes in the rock are  greatest at the surface and diminish downward, we infer that they  have been caused by"]]]
