To examine its structure,  to ascertain the uses and modes of action of its various parts, how to  protect it from injury, and maintain it in a healthy condition, is the  design of this work.    The departments of knowledge which are concerned in these investigations,  are the science of Human Physiology and the art of Hygiene.    PHYSIOLOGY treats of the vital actions and uses of the various parts of  living bodies, whether vegetable or animal. Every living thing, therefore,  has a Physiology. We have a _Vegetable_ Physiology, which relates to  plants; and an _Animal_ Physiology, relating to the animal kingdom. The  latter is also divided into _Comparative_ Physiology, which treats of the  inferior races of animals, and _Human_ Physiology, which teaches the uses  of the various parts of the human body.    HYGIENE, or the art of preserving health, is the practical use of  Physiology. It teaches us how to cultivate our bodily and mental powers, so  as to increase our strength and to fit us for a higher enjoyment of life.  It also shows us how to prevent some of the accidents which may befall the  body, and to avoid disease. It is proper that we should {12} understand the  construction and powers of our bodies; but it is our duty, as rational  beings, to know the laws by which health and strength may be maintained and  disease warded off.    There are various means by which we gain important information respecting  the Physiology of man. Plants aid us in understanding the minute structure  of the human body, its circulation, and absorption. From inferior animals  we learn much in respect to the workings of the different _organs_, as we  call those parts of the system which have a particular duty to perform. In  one of them, as in the foot of the frog, we can study the circulation of  the blood; in another, we can study the action of the brain.    By _vivisection_, or the laying bare of some organ of a living animal, we  are able to investigate certain vital processes which are too deeply hidden  in the human body to be studied directly. This is not necessarily a cruel  procedure, as we can, by the use of anaesthetics, so blunt the sensibility  of the animal under operation, that he need not suffer while the experiment  is being performed. There are other means by which we gather our  information. There are occasionally men, who, from some accident, present  certain parts, naturally out of view, in exposed positions. In these cases,  our knowledge is of much greater value than when obtained from creatures  lower in the scale of being than man.    We are greatly aided, also, by the use of various instruments of modern  invention. Chief among these is the microscope, which is, as we shall learn  hereafter, an arrangement and combination of lenses in such a way as  greatly to magnify the objects we wish to examine. {13}    We have much to say of Life, or vital activity, in the course of our study  of Physiology; but the most that we know of it is seen in its results. What  Life is, or where its precise position is, we are not able to determine. We  discover one thing, however, that all the parts of the body are united  together with wonderful sympathy, so that one part cannot be injured and  other parts not suffer damage. It is further evident that all organs are  not equally important in carrying on the work of Life; for some may  temporarily suspend their action, without serious results to the system,  while others must never cease from acting. Yet there is nothing superfluous  or without aim in our frames, and no part or organ can suffer harm without  actual loss to the general bodily health. On this point Science and Holy  Writ strictly agree.           *       *       *       *       *      {14}    {15}    PHYSIOLOGY,    AND    HYGIENE.    CHAPTER I.    THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BODY.    _The Bones--Their Form and Composition--The Properties of Bone--The  Skeleton--The Joints--The Spinal Column--The Growth of Bone--The Repair of  Bone._    [Sidenote: 1. The framework of the body? The superstructure? Softness and  delicacy of the organs? How protected?]    1. THE BONES.--The framework which sustains the human body is composed of  the _Bones_. The superstructure consists of the various organs on which the  processes of life depend. These organs are soft and delicately formed, and,  if unprotected, would, in most cases, rapidly be destroyed when subjected  to violence, however slight. The bones, having great strength and power of  resistance, afford the protection required.    [Sidenote: 2. The more delicate the organ? Example in relation to the  brain? The eye? The lungs? The services performed by the bones?]    2. The more delicate the organ, the more completely does Nature shield it.  For example: the brain, which is soft in structure, is enclosed on all  sides by a complete box of bone; the eye, though it must be near the  surface of the body to command an extensive view, is sheltered from injury  within a deep recess of bone; the lungs, requiring freedom of motion as  well as protection, are surrounded by a large case of bone and muscle. The  bones serve other useful purposes. They give permanence of form to the  body, by {16} holding the softer parts in their proper places. They assist  in movement, by affording points of attachment to those organs which have  power of motion--the muscles.    [Sidenote: 3. Their shape and size? Of what composed? Possibility of being  separated? Effect of fire? Of dilute acid?]    3. THE FORM AND COMPOSITION OF THE BONES.--Their shape and size vary  greatly in different parts of the body, but generally they are arranged in  pairs, one bone for each side of the body. They are composed of both  mineral and animal substances, united in the proportion of two parts of the  former to one of the latter; and we may separate each of these substances  from the other for examination. First, if we expose a bone to the action of  fire, the animal substance is driven off, or \"burned out.\" We now find  that, though the shape of the bone is perfectly retained, what is left is  no longer tough, and does not sustain weight as before. Again, we may  remove the mineral portion, which is a form of lime, by placing a bone into  a dilute acid. The lime will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3422"],[0,"The Life of the Fly; With Which are Interspersed Some Chapters of Autobiography (#2)"],[1,"our stride a little. As these plants, especially the  first two, might be of use to me by offering the Bees and Wasps a spoil  to forage, I am compelled to reinstate them in the ground whence they  were driven by the fork.    What abounds without my mediation is the invaders of any soil that is  first dug up and then left for a long time to its own resources. We  have, in the first rank, the couch grass, that execrable weed which  three years of stubborn warfare have not succeeded in exterminating.  Next, in respect of number, come the centauries, grim looking one  and all, bristling with prickles or starry halberds. They are the  yellow-flowered centaury, the mountain centaury, the star thistle and  the rough centaury: the first predominates. Here and there, amid their  inextricable confusion, stands, like a chandelier with spreading, orange  flowers for lights, the fierce Spanish oyster plant, whose spikes are  strong as nails. Above it, towers the Illyrian cotton thistle, whose  straight and solitary stalk soars to a height of three to six feet and  ends in large pink tufts. Its armor hardly yields before that of the  oyster plant. Nor must we forget the lesser thistle tribe, with first  of all, the prickly or 'cruel' thistle, which is so well armed that the  plant collector knows not where to grasp it; next, the spear thistle,  with its ample foliage, ending each of its veins with a spear head;  lastly, the black knapweed, which gathers itself into a spiky knot.  In among these, in long lines armed with hooks, the shoots of the blue  dewberry creep along the ground. To visit the prickly thicket when the  Wasp goes foraging, you must wear boots that come to mid-leg or else  resign yourself to a smarting in the calves. As long as the ground  retains a few remnants of the vernal rains, this rude vegetation does  not lack a certain charm, when the pyramids of the oyster plant and the  slender branches of the cotton thistle rise above the wide carpet formed  by the yellow-flowered centaury saffron heads; but let the droughts of  summer come and we see but a desolate waste, which the flame of a match  would set ablaze from one end to the other. Such is, or rather was,  when I took possession of it, the Eden of bliss where I mean to live  henceforth alone with the insect. Forty years of desperate struggle have  won it for me.    Eden, I said; and, from the point of view that interests me, the  expression is not out of place. This cursed ground, which no one would  have had at a gift to sow with a pinch of turnip seed, is an earthly  paradise for the bees and wasps. Its mighty growth of thistles and  centauries draws them all to me from everywhere around. Never, in my  insect hunting memories, have I seen so large a population at a single  spot; all the trades have made it their rallying point. Here come  hunters of every kind of game, builders in clay, weavers of cotton  goods, collectors of pieces cut from a leaf or the petals of a flower,  architects in pasteboard, plasterers mixing mortar, carpenters  boring wood, miners digging underground galleries, workers handling  goldbeater's skin and many more.    Who is this one? An Anthidium [a tailor bee]. She scrapes the cobwebby  stalk of the yellow-flowered centaury and gathers a ball of wadding  which she carries off proudly in the tips of her mandibles. She will  turn it, under ground, into cotton felt satchels to hold the store of  honey and the egg. And these others, so eager for plunder? They are  Megachiles [leaf-cutting bees], carrying under their bellies their  black, white or blood red reaping brushes. They will leave the thistles  to visit the neighboring shrubs and there cut from the leaves oval  pieces which will be made into a fit receptacle to contain the harvest.  And these, clad in black velvet? They are Chalicodomae [mason bees], who  work with cement and gravel. We could easily find their masonry on the  stones in the harmas. And these noisily buzzing with a sudden flight?  They are the Anthophorae [wild bees], who live in the old walls and the  sunny banks of the neighborhood.    Now come the Osmiae. One stacks her cells in the spiral staircase of an  empty snail shell; another, attacking the pith of a dry bit of bramble,  obtains for her grubs a cylindrical lodging and divides it into floors  by means of partition walls; a third employs the natural channel of a  cut reed; a fourth is a rent-free tenant of the vacant galleries of  some mason bee. Here are the Macrocerae and the Eucerae, whose males are  proudly horned; the Dasypodae, who carry an ample brush of bristles on  their hind legs for a reaping implement; the Andrenae, so manifold in  species; the slender-bellied Halicti [all wild bees]. I omit a host of  others. If I tried to continue this record of the guests of my thistles,  it would muster almost the whole of the honey yielding tribe. A learned  entomologist of Bordeaux, Professor Perez, to whom I submit the naming  of my prizes, once asked me if I had any special means of hunting,  to send him so many rarities and even novelties. I am not at all an  experienced and, still less, a zealous hunter, for the insect interests  me much more when engaged in its work than when struck on a pin in a  cabinet. The whole secret of my hunting is reduced to my dense nursery  of thistles and centauries.    By a most fortunate chance, with this populous family of honey gatherers  was allied the whole hunting tribe. The builders' men had distributed  here and there in the harmas great mounds of sand and heaps of stones,  with a view to running up some surrounding walls. The work dragged on  slowly; and the materials found occupants from the first year. The mason  bees had chosen the interstices between the stones as a dormitory where  to pass the night, in serried groups. The powerful eyed lizard, who,  when close pressed, attacks both man and dog, wide mouthed, had selected  a cave wherein to lie in wait for the passing scarab [a dung beetle  also known as the sacred beetle]; the black-eared chat, garbed like a  Dominican, white-frocked with black wings, sat on the top stone,  singing his short rustic lay: his nest, with its sky blue eggs, must be  somewhere in the heap. The little Dominican disappeared with the loads  of stones. I regret him: he would have been a charming neighbor. The  eyed lizard I do not regret at all.    The sand sheltered a different colony. Here, the Bembeces [digger wasps]  were sweeping the threshold of their burrows, flinging a curve of dust  behind them; the Languedocian Sphex was dragging her Ephippigera [a  green grasshopper] by the antennae; a Stizus [a hunting wasp] was  storing her preserves of Cicadellae [froghoppers]. To my sorrow, the  masons ended by evicting the sporting tribe; but, should I ever wish to  recall it, I have but to renew the mounds of sand: they will soon all be  there.    Hunters that have not disappeared, their homes being different, are the  Ammophilae, whom I see fluttering, one in spring, the others in autumn,  along the garden walks and over the lawns, in search of a caterpillar;  the Pompili [digger or hunting wasp], who travel alertly, beating their  wings and rummaging in every corner in quest of a spider. The largest  of them waylays the Narbonne Lycosa [known also as the black-bellied  tarantula], whose burrow is not infrequent in the harmas. This burrow is  a vertical well, with a curb of fescue grass intertwined with silk. You  can see the eyes of the mighty Spider gleam at the bottom of the den  like little diamonds, an object of terror to most. What a prey and what  dangerous hunting for the Pompilus! And here, on a hot summer afternoon,  is the Amazon ant, who leaves her barrack rooms in long battalions and  marches far afield to hunt for slaves. We will follow her in her raids  when we find time. Here again, around a heap of grasses turned to mould,  are Scoliae [large hunting wasps] an inch and a half long, who fly  gracefully and dive into the heap, attracted by a rich prey, the grubs  of Lamellicorns, Orycotes and Ceotoniae [various beetles].    What subjects for study! And there are more to come. The house was as  utterly deserted as the ground. When man was gone and peace assured, the  animal hastily seized on everything. The warbler took up his abode in  the lilac shrubs; the greenfinch settled in the thick shelter of the  cypresses; the sparrow carted rags and straw under every slate; the  Serin finch, whose downy nest is no bigger than half an apricot, came  and chirped in the plane tree tops; the Scops made a habit of uttering  his monotonous, piping note here, of an evening; the bird of Pallas  Athene, the owl, came hurrying along to hoot and hiss.    In front of the house is a large pond, fed by the aqueduct that supplies  the village pumps with water. Here, from half a mile and more around,  come the frogs and Toads in the lovers' season. The natterjack,  sometimes as large as a plate, with a narrow stripe of yellow down his  back, makes his appointments here to take his bath; when the evening  twilight falls, we see hopping along the edge the midwife toad, the  male, who carries a cluster of eggs, the size of peppercorns, wrapped  round his hindlegs: the genial paterfamilias has brought his precious  packet from afar, to leave it in the water and afterwards retire under  some flat stone, whence he will emit a sound like a tinkling bell.  Lastly, when not croaking amid the foliage, the tree frogs indulge in  the most graceful dives. And so, in May, as soon as it is dark, the  pond becomes a deafening orchestra: it is impossible to talk at table,  impossible to sleep. We had to remedy this by means perhaps a little  too rigorous. What could we do? He who tries to sleep and cannot needs  becomes ruthless.    Bolder still, the wasp has taken possession of the dwelling house. On my  door sill, in a soil of rubbish, nestles the white-banded Sphex: when  I go indoors, I "]]]
