Some Canadian horses, and a few specimens of a famous Vermont breed  (the Morgan) were among them. Our attention was not specially drawn in this  direction, and we will leave the merits of the rival competitors to the  awards of the judges.    [Illustration: DEVON HEIFER.    _Best three-fourth bred Devon Heifer: owned by George Shaeffer._]    [Illustration: OLD CLYDE.    _Best Foreign Horse: owned by Jane Ward, Markham, Canada West._]    [Illustration: CONSTERNATION.    _Best thorough-bred horse over four years old: owned by John B. Burnet._]    [Illustration: SOUTH DOWN SHEEP.    _Best Middle-Wooled Ewe, over Two Years Old: Owned by Lewis G. Morris._]    Of Sheep, there were a large number present--at a rough guess, Two  Thousand--embracing specimens of widely contrasted varieties. The  fine-wooled Saxonies and Merioes were largely represented; so were  coarse-wooled but fine-fleshed Bakewells and Southdowns. For three or four  years past, the annual product of wool, especially of the finer qualities,  has been unequal to the demand, causing a gradual appreciation of prices,  until a standard has this year been reached above the value of the staple.  Speculators, who had observed the gradual rise through two or three  seasons, rushed in to purchase this year's clip, at prices which cannot be  maintained, and the farmers have received some hundreds of thousands of  dollars more for their wool than the buyers can ever sell it for. This has  naturally reacted on the price of sheep, whereof choice specimens for  breeding have been sold for sums scarcely exceeded during the celebrated  Merino fever of 1816-18. _Bona fide_ sales for $100 each and over have  certainly been made; and it is confidently asserted that picked animals  from the flocks of a famous Vermont breeder were sold, to improve Ohio  flocks, at the late Fair of that State--a buck for $1,000, and six ewes for  $300 each. These reports, whether veritable or somewhat inflated, indicate  a tendency of the times. Where sheep are grown mainly for the wool, it is  as absurd to keep those of inferior grades, as to plant apple-trees without  grafting and grow two or three bushels of walnut-sized, vinegar-flavored  fruit on a tree which might as well have borne ten bushels of Spitzenbergs  or Greenings. But there is room also for improvement and profit in the  breeding of sheep other than the fine-wooled species. The famous  roast-mutton of England ought to be more than rivaled among us; for we have  a better climate and far better sheep-walks than the English in the rugged  mountain districts of New-England, of Pennsylvania, and of our own State.  The breeding of large, fine-fleshed sheep of the choicest varieties, on the  lines of all the railroads communicating with the great cities, is one of  the undertakings which promise largest and surest returns to our farmers,  and it is yet in its infancy. A hundred thousand of such sheep would be  taken annually by New-York and Philadelphia at largely remunerating prices.  Thousands of acres of sterile, scantily timbered land on the Delaware and  its branches might be profitably transformed into extensive sheep-walks,  while they must otherwise remain useless and unimproved for ages. These  lands may now be bought for a song, and are morally certain to be far  higher within the next dozen years.    [Illustration: LONG-WOOLED SHEEP.    _Best long-wooled buck and ewe over two years old: owned by J. McDonald and  Wm. Rathbone._]    Of Swine there were a good many exhibited at the Fair, but we did not waste  much time upon them. The Hog Crop once stood high among the products of the  older States, but it has gradually fallen off since the settlement of the  great West, and the cheapening of intercommunication between that section  and the East, and is destined to sink still lower. Pork can be made on the  prairies and among the nutwood forests and corn-bearing intervales of the  West for half the cost of making it in New-England; no Yankee can afford to  feed his hogs with corn, much less potatoes, as his grandfather freely did.  Only on a dairy farm can any considerable quantity of pork be profitably  made east of the Ohio; and he who keeps but a pig or two to eat up the  refuse of the kitchen cares little (perhaps too little) for the breed of  his porkers. So let them pass.    \"Fancy\" Fowls are among the hobbies of our day, as was abundantly evinced  at the State Fair. Coops piled on coops, and in rows twenty rods long, of  Chinese, Dorking, and other breeds of the most popular domestic bird,  monopolized a large share of attention; while geese, ducks, turkies, &c.,  were liberally and creditably represented. The \"Hen Convention,\" which was  a pet topic of Boston waggery a year or two since, might have been easily  and properly held at Rochester. Many of these choice barn-yard fowls were  scarcely inferior in size while doubtless superior in flavor to the  ordinary turky, while the farmer who opens the spring with a hundred of  them may half feed his family and at the same time quite keep down his  store-bill with their daily products. Small economies steadily pursued are  the source of thrift and competence to many a cultivator of flinty and  ungenial acres; few farmers can afford to disregard them. If thrice the  present number of fowls were kept among us, their care and food would  scarcely be missed, while their product would greatly increase the  aggregate not only of thrift but of comfort.    [Illustration: J. DELAFIELD'S CHINESE HOGS.]    \"Floral Hall\" was the name of a temporary though spacious structure of  scantling and rough boards, in which were exhibited, in addition to a  profusion of the flowers of the season, a display of Fruits and Vegetables  whereof Rochester might well be proud. This city seems the natural centre  of the finest fruit-growing district on the American continent--yes, in the  whole world. Its high latitude secures the richest flavors, while the harsh  northern winds, which elsewhere prove so baneful, are here softened by  passing over lake Erie or Ontario, and a climate thus produced, which, for  fruit, has no rival. Large delicious grapes of innumerable varieties;  excellent peaches; delicate, juicy, luscious pears; quinces that really  tempt the eye, though not the palate; and a profusion of fair, fragrant,  golden, mammoth apples,--these were among the products of the immediate  vicinity of Rochester exhibited in bounteous profusion. In the department  of Vegetables also there were beets and turnips of gigantic size; several  squashes weighing about one hundred and thirty pounds each; with  egg-plants, potatoes, tomatoes, and other edibles, which were all that  palate could desire. The fertility of western New-York is proverbial; but  it was never more triumphantly set forth than in the fruit and vegetables  exhibited at the State Fair.    Of butter, cheese, honey, (obtained without destroying the bees,)  maple-sugar &c., the display was much better than we have remarked on any  former occasion. And in this connection the rock salt from our own State  works around Syracuse deserves honorable mention. New-York salt has been  treated with systematic injustice by western consumers. In order to save a  shilling or two on the barrel, they buy the inferior article produced by  boiling instead of the far better obtained by solar evaporation; then they  endeavor to make a New-York standard bushel of fifty six pounds do the work  of a measured bushel of Turks Island weighing eighty pounds; and because  the laws regulating the preservation and decomposition of animal substances  will not thus be swindled, they pronounce the New-York salt impure and  worthless. Now there is no purer, no better salt than the New-York solar;  but, even of this, fifty-six pounds will not do the work of eighty. Buy the  best quality, (and even this is dog cheap,) use the proper quantity, and no  salt in the world will preserve meats better than this. The New-York solar  salt exhibited at Rochester could not be surpassed, and that which had been  _ground_ has no superior in its adaptation to the table.    There were many tasteful Counterpanes and other products of female skill  and industry exhibited, but the perpetual crowd in the 'halls' devoted to  manufactures allowed no opportunity for their critical examination. Of  stoves and ranges, heating and (let us be thankful for it, even at this  late day) ventilating apparatus and arrangements, there was a supply; and  so of daguerreotypes, trunks, harness, &c. &c. Nothing, however, arrested  our attention in this hall but the specimens of FLAX-COTTON and its various  proportions exhibited by E. G. Roberts, assignee of Claussen's patents for  the United States. We saw one intelligent influential citizen converted  from skepticism to enthusiasm for flax-cotton by his first earnest  examination. It _will_ go inevitably. A cotton fibre scarcely  distinguishable from Sea Island may be produced from flax by Claussen's  process for six cents per pound; and a machine for breaking out the fibre  from the unrotted stalk was exhibited by Mr. Clemmons of Springfield,  Massachusetts, which is calculated materially to expedite the flax-cotton  revolution. This machine renders the entire fibre, with hardly a loss of  two per cent. as 'swingle-tow,' straight and wholly separated from the  woody substance or 'shives,' at a cost which can hardly equal one cent per  pound of dressed flax. Its operation is very simple,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#2)"],[1,"ection)                       \"      252       From a Photograph by Neurdein         LA PROVENDE DES POULES.

Most travellers from London enter Paris in the evening, and I think  they are wise. I wish it were possible again and again to enter Paris  in the evening for the first time; but since it is not, let me hasten  to say that the pleasure of re-entering Paris in the evening is one  that custom has almost no power to stale. Every time that one emerges  from the Gare du Nord or the Gare St. Lazare one is taken afresh by  the variegated and vivid activity of it all--the myriad purposeful  self-contained bustling people, all moving on their unknown errands  exactly as they were moving when one was here last, no matter how long  ago. For Paris never changes: that is one of her most precious  secrets.    The London which one had left seven or eight hours before was populous  enough and busy enough, Heaven knows, but London's pulse is slow and  fairly regular, and even at her gayest, even when greeting Royalty,  she seems to be advising caution and a careful demeanour. But  Paris--Paris smiles and Paris sings. There is an incredible vivacity  in her atmosphere.    Sings! This reminds me that on the first occasion that I entered  Paris--in the evening, of course--my cabman sang. He sang all the way  from the Gare du Nord to the Rue Caumartin. This seemed to me  delightful and odd, although at first I felt in danger of attracting  more attention than one likes; but as we proceeded down the Rue  Lafayette--which nothing but song and the fact that it is the high  road into Paris from England can render tolerable--I discovered that  no one minded us. A singing cabman in London would bring out the Riot  Act and the military; but here he was in the picture: no one threw at  the jolly fellow any of the chilling deprecatory glances which are the  birthright of every light-hearted eccentric in my own land. And so we  proceeded to the hotel, often escaping collision by the breadth of a  single hair, the driver singing all the way. What he sang I knew not;  but I doubt if it was of battles long ago: rather, I should fancy, of  very present love and mischief. But how fitting a first entry into  Paris!    An hour or so later--it was just twenty years ago, but I remember it  so clearly--I observed written up in chalk in large emotional letters  on a public wall the words \"Vivent les femmes!\" and they seemed to me  also so odd--it seemed to me so funny that the sentiment should be  recorded at all, since women were obviously going to live whatever  happened--that I laughed aloud. But it was not less characteristic of  Paris than the joyous baritone notes that had proceeded from beneath  the white tall hat of my cocher. It was as natural for one Parisian to  desire the continuance of his joy as a lover, even to expressing it in  chalk in the street, as to another to beguile with lyrical snatches  the tedium of cab-driving.    I was among the Latin people, and, as I quickly began to discover, I  was myself, for the first time, a foreigner. That is a discovery which  one quickly makes in Paris.    But I have not done yet with the joy of entering and re-entering Paris  in the evening--after the long smooth journey across the marshes of  Picardy or through the orchards of Normandy and the valley of the  Seine--whichever way one travels. But whether one travels by Calais,  Boulogne, Dieppe or Havre, whether one alights at the Gare du Nord or  St. Lazare, once outside the station one is in Paris instantly: there  is no debatable land between either of these termini and the city, as  there is, for example, between the Gare de Lyons and the city. Paris  washes up to the very platforms. A few steps and here are the foreign  tables on the pavements and the foreign waiters, so brisk and clean,  flitting among them; here are the vehicles meeting and passing on the  wrong or foreign side, and beyond that, knowing apparently no law at  all; here are the deep-voiced newsvendors shouting those magic words  _La Patrie!_ _La Patrie!_ which, should a musician ever write a Paris  symphony, would recur and recur continually beneath its surface  harmonies. And here, everywhere, are the foreign people in their  ordered haste and their countless numbers.    The pleasure of entering and re-entering Paris in the evening is only  equalled by the pleasure of stepping forth into the street the next  morning in the sparkling Parisian air and smelling again the pungent  Parisian scent and gathering in the foreign look of the place. I know  of no such exuberance as one draws in with these first Parisian  inhalations on a fine morning in May or June--and in Paris in May and  June it is always fine, just as in Paris in January and February it is  always cold or wet. His would be a very sluggish or disenchanted  spirit who was not thus exhilarated; for here at his feet is the  holiday city of Europe and the clean sun over all.    And then comes the question \"What to do?\" Shall we go at once to  \"Monna Lisa\"? But could there be a better morning for the children in  the Champs-Elysees? That beautiful head in the His de la Salle  collection--attributed to the school of Fabriano! How delightfully the  sun must be lighting up the red walls of the Place des Vosges! Rodin's  \"Kiss\" at the Luxembourg--we meant to go straight to that! The wheel  window in Notre Dame, in the north transept--I have been thinking of  that ever since we planned to come.    So may others talk and act; but I have no hesitancies. My duty is  clear as crystal. On the first morning I pay a visit of reverence and  delight to the ancient auberge of the Compas d'Or at No. 64 Rue  Montorgeuil. And this I shall always do until it is razed to the  earth, as it seems likely to be under the gigantic scheme, beyond  Haussmann almost, which is to renovate the most picturesque if the  least sanitary portions of old Paris at a cost of over thirty millions  of pounds. Unhappy day--may it be long postponed! For some years now I  have always approached the Compas d'Or with trembling and foreboding.  Can it still be there? I ask myself. Can that wonderful wooden hanger  that covers half the courtyard have held so long? Will there be a  motor-car among the old diligences and waggons? But it is always the  same.    From the street--and the Rue Montorgeuil is as a whole one of the most  picturesque and characteristic of the older streets of Paris, with its  high white houses, each containing fifty families, its narrowness, its  barrows of fruit and green stuff by both pavements, and its crowds of  people--from the street, the Compas d'Or is hardly noticeable, for a  butcher and a cutler occupy most of its facade; but the sign and the  old carvings over these shops give away the secret, and you pass  through one of the narrow archways on either side and are straightway  in a romance by the great Dumas. Into just such a courtyard would  D'Artagnan have dashed, and leaping from one sweating steed leap on  another and be off again amid a shower of sparks on the stones. Time  has stood still here.    There is no other such old inn left. The coach to Dreux--now probably  a carrier's cart--still regularly runs from this spot, as it has done  ever since the beginning of the sixteenth century. Rows of horses  stand in its massive stables and fill the air with their warm and  friendly scent; a score of ancient carts huddle in the yard, in a  corner of which there will probably be a little group of women  shelling peas; beneath the enormous hanger are more vehicles, and  masses of hay on which the carters sleep. The ordinary noise of Paris  gives way, in this sanctuary of antiquity, to the scraping of hoofs,  the rattle of halter bolts, and the clatter of the wooden shoes of  ostlers. It is the past in actual being--Civilisation, like Time, has  stood still in the yard of the Compas d'Or. That is why I hasten to it  so eagerly and shall always do so until it disappears for ever. There  is nothing else in Paris like it.    And after? Well, the next thing is to have lunch. And since this  lunch--being the first--will be the best lunch of the holiday and  therefore the best meal of the holiday (for every meal on a holiday in  Paris is a little better than that which follows it), it is an  enterprise not lightly to be undertaken. One must decide carefully,  for this is to be an extravagance: the search for the little  out-of-the-way restaurant will come later. To-day we are rich.      [Illustration: THE COURTYARD OF THE COMPAS D'OR, RUE MONTORGEUIL]    This book is not a guide for the gastronome and gourmet. How indeed  could it be, even although when heaven sends a cheerful hour one would  scorn to refrain? Yet none the less it would be pleasant in this  commentary upon a city illustrious for its culinary ingenuity and  genius to say something of restaurants. But what is one to say here on  such a theme? Volumes are needed. Every one has his own taste."]]]
