And the only man on earth who could prove his innocence  was Kirkstone, the man who was gloating like a Shylock over his pound  of flesh. Conniston, if you had known these things and had been in my  shoes, what would you have done?\"    Conniston, lighting another taper over the oil flame, hesitated and  answered: \"I don't know yet, old chap. What did you do?\"    \"I fairly got down on my knees to the scoundrel,\" resumed Keith. \"If  ever a man begged for another man's life, I begged for my father's--for  the few words from Kirkstone that would set him free. I offered  everything I had in the world, even my body and soul. God, I'll never  forget that night! He sat there, fat and oily, two big rings on his  stubby fingers--a monstrous toad in human form--and he chuckled and  laughed at me in his joy, as though I were a mountebank playing amusing  tricks for him--and there my soul was bleeding itself out before his  eyes! And his son came in, fat and oily and accursed like his father,  and HE laughed at me. I didn't know that such hatred could exist in the  world, or that vengeance could bring such hellish joy. I could still  hear their gloating laughter when I stumbled out into the night. It  haunted me. I heard it in the trees. It came in the wind. My brain was  filled with it--and suddenly I turned back, and I went into that house  again without knocking, and I faced the two of them alone once more in  that room. And this time, Conniston, I went back to get justice--or to  kill. Thus far it was premeditated, but I went with my naked hands.  There was a key in the door, and I locked it. Then I made my demand. I  wasted no words--\"    Keith rose from the table and began to pace back and forth. The wind  had died again. They could hear the yapping of the foxes and the low  thunder of the ice.    \"The son began it,\" said Keith. \"He sprang at me. I struck him. We  grappled, and then the beast himself leaped at me with some sort of  weapon in his hand. I couldn't see what it was, but it was heavy. The  first blow almost broke my shoulder. In the scuffle I wrenched it from  his hand, and then I found it was a long, rectangular bar of copper  made for a paper-weight. In that same instant I saw the son snatch up a  similar object from the table, and in the act he smashed the table  light. In darkness we fought. I did not feel that I was fighting men.  They were monsters and gave me the horrible sensation of being in  darkness with crawling serpents. Yes, I struck hard. And the son was  striking, and neither of us could see. I felt my weapon hit, and it was  then that Kirkstone crumpled down with a blubbery wheeze. You know what  happened after that. The next morning only one copper weight was found  in that room. The son had done away with the other. And the one that  was left was covered with Kirkstone's blood and hair. There was no  chance for me. So I got away. Six months later my father died in  prison, and for three years I've been hunted as a fox is hunted by the  hounds. That's all, Conniston. Did I kill Judge Kirkstone? And, if I  killed him, do you think I'm sorry for it, even though I hang?\"    \"Sit down!\"    The Englishman's voice was commanding. Keith dropped back to his seat,  breathing hard. He saw a strange light in the steely blue eyes of  Conniston.    \"Keith, when a man knows he's going to live, he is blind to a lot of  things. But when he knows he's going to die, it's different. If you had  told me that story a month ago, I'd have taken you down to the hangman  just the same. It would have been my duty, you know, and I might have  argued you were lying. But you can't lie to me--now. Kirkstone deserved  to die. And so I've made up my mind what you're going to do. You're not  going back to Coronation Gulf. You're going south. You're going back  into God's country again. And you're not going as John Keith, the  murderer, but as Derwent Conniston of His Majesty's Royal Northwest  Mounted Police! Do you get me, Keith? Do you understand?\"    Keith simply stared. The Englishman twisted a mustache, a half-humorous  gleam in his eyes. He had been thinking of this plan of his for some  time, and he had foreseen just how it would take Keith off his feet.    \"Quite a scheme, don't you think, old chap? I like you. I don't mind  saying I think a lot of you, and there isn't any reason on earth why  you shouldn't go on living in my shoes. There's no moral objection. No  one will miss me. I was the black sheep back in England--younger  brother and all that--and when I had to choose between Africa and  Canada, I chose Canada. An Englishman's pride is the biggest fool thing  on earth, Keith, and I suppose all of them over there think I'm dead.  They haven't heard from me in six or seven years. I'm forgotten. And  the beautiful thing about this scheme is that we look so deucedly  alike, you know. Trim that mustache and beard of yours a little, add a  bit of a scar over your right eye, and you can walk in on old McDowell  himself, and I'll wager he'll jump up and say, 'Bless my heart, if it  isn't Conniston!' That's all I've got to leave you, Keith, a dead man's  clothes and name. But you're welcome. They'll be of no more use to me  after tomorrow.\"    \"Impossible!\" gasped Keith. \"Conniston, do you know what you are  saying?\"    \"Positively, old chap. I count every word, because it hurts when I  talk. So you won't argue with me, please. It's the biggest sporting  thing that's ever come my way. I'll be dead. You can bury me under this  floor, where the foxes can't get at me. But my name will go on living  and you'll wear my clothes back to civilization and tell McDowell how  you got your man and how he died up here with a frosted lung. As proof  of it you'll lug your own clothes down in a bundle along with any other  little identifying things you may have, and there's a sergeancy  waiting. McDowell promised it to you--if you got your man. Understand?  And McDowell hasn't seen me for two years and three months, so if I  MIGHT look a bit different to him, it would be natural, for you and I  have been on the rough edge of the world all that time. The jolly good  part of it all is that we look so much alike. I say the idea is  splendid!\"    Conniston rose above the presence of death in the thrill of the great  gamble he was projecting. And Keith, whose heart was pounding like an  excited fist, saw in a flash the amazing audacity of the thing that was  in Conniston's mind, and felt the responsive thrill of its  possibilities. No one down there would recognize in him the John Keith  of four years ago. Then he was smooth-faced, with shoulders that  stooped a little and a body that was not too strong. Now he was an  animal! A four years' fight with the raw things of life had made him  that, and inch for inch he measured up with Conniston. And Conniston,  sitting opposite him, looked enough like him to be a twin brother. He  seemed to read the thought in Keith's mind. There was an amused glitter  in his eyes.    \"I suppose it's largely because of the hair on our faces,\" he said.  \"You know a beard can cover a multitude of physical sins--and  differences, old chap. I wore mine two years before I started out after  you, vandyked rather carefully, you understand, so you'd better not use  a razor. Physically you won't run a ghost of a chance of being caught.  You'll look the part. The real fun is coming in other ways. In the next  twenty-four hours you've got to learn by heart the history of Derwent  Conniston from the day he joined the Royal Mounted. We won't go back  further than that, for it wouldn't interest you, and ancient history  won't turn up to trouble you. Your biggest danger will be with  McDowell, commanding F Division at Prince Albert. He's a human fox of  the old military school, mustaches and all, and he can see through  boiler-plate. But he's got a big heart. He has been a good friend of  mine, so along with Derwent Conniston's story you've got to load up  with a lot about McDowell, too. There are many things--OH, GOD--\"    He flung a hand to his chest. Grim horror settled in the little cabin  as the cough convulsed him. And over it the wind shrieked again,  swallowing up the yapping of the foxes and the rumble of the ice.    That night, in the yellow sputter of the seal-oil lamp, the fight  began. Grim-faced--one realizing the nearness of death and struggling  to hold it back, the other praying for time--two men went through the  amazing process of trading their identities. From the beginning it was  Conniston's fight. And Keith, looking at him, knew that in this last  mighty effort to die game the Englishman was narrowing the slight  margin of hours ahead of him. Keith had loved but one man, his father.  In this fight he learned to love another, Conniston. And once he cried  out bitterly that it was unfair, that Conniston should live and he  should die. The dying Englishman smiled and laid a hand on his, and  Keith felt that the hand was damp with a cold sweat.    Through the terrible hours that followed Keith felt the strength and  courage of the dying man becoming slowly a part of himself. The thing  was epic. Conniston, throttling his own agony, was magnificent. And  Keith felt his warped and despairing soul swelling with a new life and  a new hope, and he was thrilled by the thought of what he must do to  live up to the mark of the Englishman. Conniston's story was of the  important things first. It began with his acquaintance with McDowell.  And then, between the paroxysms that stained his lips red, he filled in  with incident and smiled wanly as he told how McDowell had sworn him to  secrecy once in the matter of an incident which the chief did not want  the barracks to know--and laugh over. A very sensitive man in some ways  was McDowell! At the end of the first hour Keith stood up in the middle  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#2)"],[1,"was not quite born  until then. And when Kazan went away, leaving them alone in darkness,  Baree whimpered for him to come back, just as he had cried for his  mother when now and then she had left him in response to her mate's  call.    The sun was straight above the forest when, an hour or two after  Kazan's visit, Gray Wolf slipped away. Between Baree's nest and the top  of the windfall were forty feet of jammed and broken timber through  which not a ray of light could break. This blackness did not frighten  him, for he had yet to learn the meaning of light. Day, and not night,  was to fill him with his first great terror. So quite fearlessly, with  a yelp for his mother to wait for him, he began to follow. If Gray Wolf  heard him, she paid no attention to his call, and the sound of the  scraping of her claws on the dead timber died swiftly away.    This time Baree did not stop at the eight-inch log which had always  shut in his world in that particular direction. He clambered to the top  of it and rolled over on the other side. Beyond this was vast  adventure, and he plunged into it courageously.    It took him a long time to make the first twenty yards. Then he came to  a log worn smooth by the feet of Gray Wolf and Kazan, and stopping  every few feet to send out a whimpering call for his mother, he made  his way farther and farther along it. As he went, there grew slowly a  curious change in this world of his. He had known nothing but  blackness. And now this blackness seemed breaking itself up into  strange shapes and shadows. Once he caught the flash of a fiery streak  above him--a gleam of sunshine--and it startled him so that he  flattened himself down upon the log and did not move for half a minute.  Then he went on. An ermine squeaked under him. He heard the swift  rustling of a squirrel's feet, and a curious whut-whut-whut that was  not at all like any sound his mother had ever made. He was off the  trail.    The log was no longer smooth, and it was leading him upward higher and  higher into the tangle of the windfall, and was growing narrower every  foot he progressed. He whined. His soft little nose sought vainly for  the warm scent of his mother. The end came suddenly when he lost his  balance and fell. He let out a piercing cry of terror as he felt  himself slipping, and then plunged downward. He must have been high up  in the windfall, for to Baree it seemed a tremendous fall. His soft  little body thumped from log to log as he shot this way and that, and  when at last he stopped, there was scarcely a breath left in him. But  he stood up quickly on his four trembling legs--and blinked.    A new terror held Baree rooted there. In an instant the whole world had  changed. It was a flood of sunlight. Everywhere he looked he could see  strange things. But it was the sun that frightened him most. It was his  first impression of fire, and it made his eyes smart. He would have  slunk back into the friendly gloom of the windfall, but at this moment  Gray Wolf came around the end of a great log, followed by Kazan. She  muzzled Baree joyously, and Kazan in a most doglike fashion wagged his  tail. This mark of the dog was to be a part of Baree. Half wolf, he  would always wag his tail. He tried to wag it now. Perhaps Kazan saw  the effort, for he emitted a muffled yelp of approbation as he sat back  on his haunches.    Or he might have been saying to Gray Wolf:    \"Well, we've got the little rascal out of that windfall at last,  haven't we?\"    For Baree it had been a great day. He had discovered his father--and  the world.        CHAPTER 2    And it was a wonderful world--a world of vast silence, empty of  everything but the creatures of the wild. The nearest Hudson's Bay post  was a hundred miles away, and the first town of civilization was a  straight three hundred to the south. Two years before, Tusoo, the Cree  trapper, had called this his domain. It had come down to him, as was  the law of the forests, through generations of forefathers. But Tusoo  had been the last of his worn-out family; he had died of smallpox, and  his wife and his children had died with him. Since then no human foot  had taken up his trails. The lynx had multiplied. The moose and caribou  had gone unhunted by man. The beaver had built their  homes--undisturbed. The tracks of the black bear were as thick as the  tracks of the deer farther south. And where once the deadfalls and  poison baits of Tusoo had kept the wolves thinned down, there was no  longer a menace for these mohekuns of the wilderness.    Following the sun of this first wonderful day came the moon and the  stars of Baree's first real night. It was a splendid night, and with it  a full red moon sailed up over the forests, flooding the earth with a  new kind of light, softer and more beautiful to Baree. The wolf was  strong in him, and he was restless. He had slept that day in the warmth  of the sun, but he could not sleep in this glow of the moon. He nosed  uneasily about Gray Wolf, who lay flat on her belly, her beautiful head  alert, listening yearningly to the night sounds, and for the tonguing  of Kazan, who had slunk away like a shadow to hunt.    Half a dozen times, as Baree wandered about near the windfall, he heard  a soft whir over his head, and once or twice he saw gray shadows  floating swiftly through the air. They were the big northern owls  swooping down to investigate him, and if he had been a rabbit instead  of a wolf dog whelp, his first night under the moon and stars would  have been his last; for unlike Wapoos, the rabbit, he was not cautious.  Gray Wolf did not watch him closely. Instinct told her that in these  forests there was no great danger for Baree except at the hands of man.  In his veins ran the blood of the wolf. He was a hunter of all other  wild creatures, but no other creature, either winged or fanged, hunted  him.    In a way Baree sensed this. He was not afraid of the owls. He was not  afraid of the strange bloodcurdling cries they made in the black spruce  tops. But once fear entered into him, and he scurried back to his  mother. It was when one of the winged hunters of the air swooped down  on a snowshoe rabbit, and the squealing agony of the doomed creature  set his heart thumping like a little hammer. He felt in those cries the  nearness of that one ever-present tragedy of the wild--death. He felt  it again that night when, snuggled close to Gray Wolf, he listened to  the fierce outcry of a wolf pack that was close on the heels of a young  caribou bull. And the meaning of it all, and the wild thrill of it all,  came home to him early in the gray dawn when Kazan returned, holding  between his jaws a huge rabbit that was still kicking and squirming  with life.    This rabbit was the climax in the first chapter of Baree's education.  It was as if Gray Wolf and Kazan had planned it all out, so that he  might receive his first instruction in the art of killing. When Kazan  had dropped it, Baree approached the big hare cautiously. The back of  Wapoos, the rabbit, was broken. His round eyes were glazed, and he had  ceased to feel pain. But to Baree, as he dug his tiny teeth into the  heavy fur under Wapoos's throat, the hare was very much alive. The  teeth did not go through into the flesh. With puppyish fierceness Baree  hung on. He thought that he was killing. He could feel the dying  convulsions of Wapoos. He could hear the last gasping breaths leaving  the warm body, and he snarled and tugged until finally he fell back  with a mouthful of fur. When he returned to the attack, Wapoos was  quite dead, and Baree continued to bite and snarl until Gray Wolf came  with her sharp fangs and tore the rabbit to pieces. After that followed  the feast.    So Baree came to understand that to eat meant to kill, and as other  days and nights passed, there grew in him swiftly the hunger for flesh.  In this he was the true wolf. From Kazan he had taken other and  stronger inheritances of the dog. He was magnificently black, which in  later days gave him the name of Kusketa Mohekun--the black wolf. On his  breast was a white star. His right ear was tipped with white. His tail,  at six weeks, was bushy and hung low. It was a wolf's tail. His ears  were Gray Wolf's ears--sharp, short, pointed, always alert. His  foreshoulders gave promise of being splendidly like Kazan's, and when  he stood up he was like the trace dog, except that he always stood  sidewise to the point or object he was watching. This, again, was the  wolf, for a dog faces the direction in which he is looking intently.    One brilliant night, when Baree was two months old, and when the sky  was filled with stars and a June moon so bright that it seemed scarcely  higher than the tall spruce tops, Baree settled back on his haunches  and howled. It was a first effort. But there was no mistake in the note  of it. It was the wolf howl. But a moment later when Baree slunk up to  Kazan, as if deeply ashamed of his effort, he was wagging his tail in  an unmistakably apologetic manner. And this again was the dog. If  Tusoo, the dead Indian trapper, could have seen him then, he would have  judged him by that wagging of his tail. It revealed the fact that deep  in his heart--and in his soul, if we can concede that he had one--Baree  was a dog.    In another way Tusoo would have found judgment of him. At two months  the wolf whelp has forgotten how to play. He is a slinking part of the  wilderness, already at work preying on creatures smaller and more  helpless than himself. Baree still played. In his excursions away from  the windfall he had never gone farther than the creek, a hundred yards  from where his mother lay. He had helped to tear many dead and dying  rabbits into pieces. He believed, if he thought upon the matter at all,  that he was exceedingly fierce and courageous. But it was his ninth  week before he felt his spurs and fought his terrible battle with the  young owl in"]]]
