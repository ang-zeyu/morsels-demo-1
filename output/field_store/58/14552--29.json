We  waited near all day at Big Spring. Then thet greaser rode up an' sent us  here. We're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets.\"    \"I won't keep you long,\" said Beasley. \"But even if I did you'd not  mind--when I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchincloss--the man who  made an outlaw of you!\"    Anson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame. Wilson,  likewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door--then began  to whisper.    \"Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent  back to Missouri for a niece--a young girl--an' he means to leave his  ranches an' sheep--all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else....  Them ranches--an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were  pardners in sheep-raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw  me out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt--owed me  sheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine--an' all the way down  the trail--as Auchincloss has.... An' Snake, see here--\"    He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the  blaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim  Wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.    \"See here,\" panted Beasley. \"The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on  the sixteenth. That's a week from to-morrow. She'll take the stage to  Snowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.\"    \"A-huh!\" grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. \"An' what of all thet?\"    \"She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!\"    \"You want me to hold up the stage--an' get the girl?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Wal--an' what then?\"    \"Make off with her.... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll  press my claims on Auchincloss--hound him--an' be ready when he croaks  to take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I  care.... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let  the gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll  make you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new  territory.\"    \"Thet might be wise,\" muttered Snake Anson. \"Beasley, the weak point in  your game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.\"    \"Auchincloss is a dyin' man,\" declared Beasley, with such positiveness  that it could not be doubted.    \"Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him.... Beasley, in  case I play your game--how'm I to know that girl?\"    \"Her name's Helen Rayner,\" replied Beasley, eagerly. \"She's twenty  years old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the  handsomest.\"    \"A-huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal--an' one I ain't  fancyin'.... But I never doubted your word.... Come on--an' talk out.  What's in it for me?\"    \"Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it  was never held up.... But you want to mask.... How about ten thousand  sheep--or what they bring at Phenix in gold?\"    Jim Wilson whistled low.    \"An' leave for new territory?\" repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.    \"You've said it.\"    \"Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on  me.... September sixteenth at Magdalena--an' her name's Helen--an' she's  handsome?\"    \"Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if  the weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.\"    Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves  and pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode  out into the night.    \"Jim, what do you make of him?\" queried Snake Anson.    \"Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,\" replied Wilson.    \"A-huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.\" And he led the way out.    Low voices drifted into the cabin, then came snorts of horses and  striking hoofs, and after that a steady trot, gradually ceasing.  Once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest  stillness.        CHAPTER II    Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with thoughtful eyes, into the gloom.    He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his  school and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon-train of pioneers, he was  one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White  Mountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep-raising or  monotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest,  with only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This  wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for  the villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but  that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive  instinctive force of a savage.    And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one  of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a  friend.    \"That man Beasley!\" he soliloquized. \"Beasley--in cahoots with Snake  Anson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor  old man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!\"    Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.    \"A girl--Helen Rayner--twenty years old,\" he mused. \"Beasley wants her  made off with.... That means--worse than killed!\"    Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired  by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked  their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for  that trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and  children appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls.  The image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he  suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not  to befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably  she was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home.  How little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many  trails ended abruptly in the forest--and only trained woodsmen could  read the tragedy.    \"Strange how I cut across country to-day from Spruce Swamp,\" reflected  Dale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His  methods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of  his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and  of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was  indeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew  conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had  little to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt  his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.    \"Old Al won't listen to me,\" pondered Dale. \"An' even if he did, he  wouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will.... All the same, Snake Anson  won't get that girl.\"    With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and  his pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and  peered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;  broken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;  fine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of  a low, dull roar.    \"Reckon I'd better hang up here,\" he said, and turned to the fire. The  coals were red now. From the depths of his hunting-coat he procured a  little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid  for a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;  then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter  grateful for little.    He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of  the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.  Outside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased  to a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily  lulling; and he heard the storm-wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,  and anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw  pictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.    Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,  and soon fell asleep.      When the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross-country, to the  village of Pine.    During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A  suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray--the  parks, the glades--and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the  forest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent  with spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the  dreaming woodland awoke to the far-reaching rays of a bursting red sun.    This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset  was his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that  answered the whistle of a stag from a near-by ridge. His strides were  long, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the  dew-laden grass.    Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest  climbing, but the \"senacas\"--those parklike meadows so named by Mexican  sheep-herders--were as round and level as if they had been made by man  in beautiful contrast to the dark-green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both  open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance  of game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the  spruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush,  and stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he  noiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking  some quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges.  They whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In  every senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds "]]]
