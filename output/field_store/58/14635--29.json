She paused in  the doorway and smiled pleasantly.    \"Garny, old horse,\" said Ukridge with some pride, \"this is _her_! The  pride of the home. Companion of joys and sorrows and all the rest of  it. In fact,\" in a burst of confidence, \"my wife.\"    I bowed awkwardly. The idea of Ukridge married was something too  overpowering to be readily assimilated.    \"Buck up, old horse,\" said Ukridge encouragingly. He had a painful  habit of addressing all and sundry by that title. In his school-master  days--at one period of his vivid career he and I had been colleagues on  the staff of a private school--he had made use of it interviewing the  parents of new pupils, and the latter had gone away, as a rule, with a  feeling that this must be either the easy manner of Genius or due to  alcohol, and hoping for the best. He also used it to perfect strangers  in the streets, and on one occasion had been heard to address a bishop  by that title, rendering that dignitary, as Mr. Baboo Jaberjee would  put it, _sotto voce_ with gratification. \"Surprised to find me married,  what? Garny, old boy,\"--sinking his voice to a whisper almost inaudible  on the other side of the street--\"take my tip. Go and jump off the dock  yourself. You'll feel another man. Give up this bachelor business. It's  a mug's game. I look on you bachelors as excrescences on the social  system. I regard you, old man, purely and simply as a wart. Go and get  married, laddie, go and get married. By gad, I've forgotten to pay the  cabby. Lend me a couple of bob, Garny old chap.\"    He was out of the door and on his way downstairs before the echoes of  his last remark had ceased to shake the window. I was left to entertain  Mrs. Ukridge.    So far her share in the conversation had been confined to the pleasant  smile which was apparently her chief form of expression. Nobody talked  very much when Ukridge was present. She sat on the edge of the  armchair, looking very small and quiet. I was conscious of feeling a  benevolent pity for her. If I had been a girl, I would have preferred  to marry a volcano. A little of Ukridge, as his former head master had  once said in a moody, reflective voice, went a very long way. \"You and  Stanley have known each other a long time, haven't you?\" said the  object of my commiseration, breaking the silence.    \"Yes. Oh, yes. Several years. We were masters at the same school.\"    Mrs. Ukridge leaned forward with round, shining eyes.    \"Really? Oh, how nice!\" she said ecstatically.    Not yet, to judge from her expression and the tone of her voice, had  she found any disadvantages attached to the arduous position of being  Mrs. Stanley Ukridge.    \"He's a wonderfully versatile man,\" I said.    \"I believe he could do anything.\"    \"He'd have a jolly good try!\"    \"Have you ever kept fowls?\" asked Mrs. Ukridge, with apparent  irrelevance.    I had not. She looked disappointed.    \"I was hoping you might have had some experience. Stanley, of course,  can turn his hand to anything; but I think experience is rather a good  thing, don't you?\"    \"Yes. But ...\"    \"I have bought a shilling book called 'Fowls and All About Them,' and  this week's copy of C.A.C.\"    \"C.A.C.?\"    \"_Chiefly About Chickens_. It's a paper, you know. But it's all rather  hard to understand. You see, we ... but here is Stanley. He will  explain the whole thing.\"    \"Well, Garny, old horse,\" said Ukridge, re-entering the room after  another energetic passage of the stairs. \"Years since I saw you. Still  buzzing along?\"    \"Still, so to speak, buzzing,\" I assented.    \"I was reading your last book the other day.\"    \"Yes?\" I said, gratified. \"How did you like it?\"    \"Well, as a matter of fact, laddie, I didn't get beyond the third page,  because the scurvy knave at the bookstall said he wasn't running a free  library, and in one way and another there was a certain amount of  unpleasantness. Still, it seemed bright and interesting up to page  three. But let's settle down and talk business. I've got a scheme for  you, Garny old man. Yessir, the idea of a thousand years. Now listen to  me for a moment. Let me get a word in edgeways.\"    He sat down on the table, and dragged up a chair as a leg-rest. Then he  took off his pince-nez, wiped them, re-adjusted the ginger-beer wire  behind his ears, and, having hit a brown patch on the knee of his grey  flannel trousers several times, in the apparent hope of removing it,  resumed:    \"About fowls.\"    The subject was beginning to interest me. It showed a curious tendency  to creep into the conversation of the Ukridge family.    \"I want you to give me your undivided attention for a moment. I was  saying to my wife, as we came here, 'Garnet's the man! Clever devil,  Garnet. Full of ideas.' Didn't I, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"Laddie,\" said Ukridge impressively, \"we are going to keep fowls.\"    He shifted himself farther on to the table and upset the ink-pot.    \"Never mind,\" he said, \"it'll soak in. It's good for the texture. Or am  I thinking of tobacco-ash on the carpet? Well, never mind. Listen to  me! When I said that we were going to keep fowls, I didn't mean in a  small, piffling sort of way--two cocks and a couple of hens and a  golf-ball for a nest-egg. We are going to do it on a large scale. We  are going to run a chicken farm!\"    \"A chicken farm,\" echoed Mrs. Ukridge with an affectionate and admiring  glance at her husband.    \"Ah,\" I said, feeling my responsibilities as chorus. \"A chicken farm.\"    \"I've thought it all over, laddie, and it's as clear as mud. No  expenses, large profits, quick returns. Chickens, eggs, and the money  streaming in faster than you can bank it. Winter and summer  underclothing, my bonny boy, lined with crackling Bradbury's. It's the  idea of a lifetime. Now listen to me for a moment. You get your hen--\"    \"One hen?\"    \"Call it one for the sake of argument. It makes my calculations  clearer. Very well, then. Harriet the hen--you get her. Do you follow  me so far?\"    \"Yes. You get a hen.\"    \"I told you Garnet was a dashed bright fellow,\" said Ukridge  approvingly to his attentive wife. \"Notice the way he keeps right after  one's ideas? Like a bloodhound. Well, where was I?\"    \"You'd just got a hen.\"    \"Exactly. The hen. Pricilla the pullet. Well, it lays an egg every day  of the week. You sell the eggs, six for half a crown. Keep of hen costs  nothing. Profit--at least a couple of bob on every dozen eggs. What do  you think of that?\"    \"I think I'd like to overhaul the figures in case of error.\"    \"Error!\" shouted Ukridge, pounding the table till it groaned. \"Error?  Not a bit of it. Can't you follow a simple calculation like that? Oh, I  forgot to say that you get--and here is the nub of the thing--you get  your first hen on tick. Anybody will be glad to let you have the hen on  tick. Well, then, you let this hen--this first, original hen, this  on-tick-hen--you let it set and hatch chickens. Now follow me closely.  Suppose you have a dozen hens. Very well, then. When each of the dozen  has a dozen chickens, you send the old hens back to the chappies you  borrowed them from, with thanks for kind loan; and there you are,  starting business with a hundred and forty-four free chickens to your  name. And after a bit, when the chickens grow up and begin to lay, all  you have to do is to sit back in your chair and endorse the big  cheques. Isn't that so, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"We've fixed it all up. Do you know Combe Regis, in Dorsetshire? On the  borders of Devon. Bathing. Sea-air. Splendid scenery. Just the place  for a chicken farm. A friend of Millie's--girl she knew at school--has  lent us a topping old house, with large grounds. All we've got to do is  to get in the fowls. I've ordered the first lot. We shall find them  waiting for us when we arrive.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"I'm sure I wish you luck. Mind you let me know how you  get on.\"    \"Let you know!\" roared Ukridge. \"Why, my dear old horse, you're coming  with us.\"    \"Am I?\" I said blankly.    \"Certainly you are. We shall take no refusal. Will we, Millie?\"    \"No, dear.\"    \"Of course not. No refusal of any sort. Pack up to-night and meet us at  Waterloo to-morrow.\"    \"It's awfully good of you ...\"    \"Not a bit of it--not a bit of it. This is pure business. I was saying  to Millie as we came along that you were the very man for us. A man  with your flow of ideas will be invaluable on a chicken farm.  Absolutely invaluable. You see,\" proceeded Ukridge, \"I'm one of those  practical fellows. The hard-headed type. I go straight ahead, following  my nose. What you want in a business of this sort is a touch of the  dreamer to help out the practical mind. We look to you for suggestions,  laddie. Flashes of inspiration and all that sort of thing. Of course,  you take your share of the profits. That's understood. Yes, yes, I must  insist. Strict business between friends. Now, taking it that, at a  conservative estimate, the net profits for the first fiscal year amount  to--five thousand, no, better be on the safe side--say, four thousand  five hundred pounds ... But we'll arrange all that end of it when we  get down there. Millie will look after that. She's the secretary of the  concern. She's been writing letters to people asking for hens. So you  see it's a thoroughly organised business. How many hen-letters did you  write last week, old girl?\"    \"Ten, dear.\"    Ukridge turned triumphantly to me.    \"You hear? Ten. Ten letters asking for hens. That's the way to succeed.  Push and enterprise.\"    \"Six of them haven't answered, Stanley, dear, and the rest refused.\"    \"Immaterial,\" said Ukridge with a grand gesture. \"That doesn't matter.  The point is that the letters were written. It shows we are solid and  practical. Well now, can you get your things ready by to-morrow, Garny  old horse?\"    Strange how one reaches an epoch-making moment in one's life without  recognising"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],[0,"Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#2)"],[1,"of braincase._--Greatest distance across braincase, taken at  right angles to long axis of skull. _G_ to _G'_    _Depth of cranium._--The distance from the dorsalmost part of the  braincase to a flat plane touching tips of incisors and ventral border  of each auditory bulla.

The names of the cusps and ridges of the teeth (see Figure 2) are those  suggested by Wood and Wilson (1936:389-390). Terminology of the enamel  grooves and folds is that of Hershkovitz (1944:17) and Hooper  (1952b:20-21).    Because secondary sexual variation was not significant (see page 597),  both males and females of like age and pelage were used in comparisons  of samples designed to reveal geographic variation.    The species are arranged from less to more progressive; the subspecies  are arranged alphabetically.    In the synonymy of each subspecies, the plan has been to cite: (1) the  name first proposed; (2) the first usage of the name combination  employed by me; (3) all other name combinations in chronological order  that have been applied to the subspecies concerned.    The localities of specimens examined are listed by country from north to  south. Within a country, the listing is by state, beginning with the  northwesternmost state and proceeding by tiers (west to east) to the  southeasternmost state. Within a state of the United States, the listing  is by counties in the same geographic order as described for states.  Within any county in the United States, within any state in Mexico, and  within any country in Central America, the listing of localities is from  north to south. When more than one locality is on the same line of  latitude, the westernmost locality is listed first. Marginal localities  for each subspecies are listed in a paragraph at the end of each  account. Each marginal locality is mapped by means of a circle. The  circles are listed in clockwise order, beginning with the northernmost.  When more than one of these localities lies on the same line of  latitude, the westernmost is cited first. Localities not represented on  the distribution maps, so as to avoid undue crowding of symbols, are  italicized in the lists of specimens examined.        [Illustration: FIG. 2.

PALEONTOLOGY OF THE GENUS      Five fossil species, all extinct, have been assigned to the genus and  range in time from early late Pliocene (Saw Rock Canyon fauna of  Hibbard, 1953:408) to Mid-Pleistocene (see Hibbard, 1958:25, who  assigns the Curtis Ranch fauna to late Kansan or early Yarmouth).    I examined all known fossil material and compared it with Recent  material. When the antiquity of the genus is considered, the degree of  difference between the oldest fossil species and the two living species  is much less than might be expected.      =Baiomys sawrockensis= Hibbard        _Baiomys sawrockensis_ Hibbard, Papers Mich. Acad. Sci., Arts and         Letters, 38:402, April 27, 1953.    _Type._--No. 27506, Univ. Michigan; left mandibular ramus bearing m1-m3  and incisor; Saw Rock Canyon, early late Pliocene, XI member of the  Rexroad formation, sec. 36, T. 34 S, R. 31 W, Seward County, Kansas  (University of Kansas, Locality 6).    _Referred material._--Univ. Michigan, Nos. 25781, 27503-27505,  28159-28165, 29708-29715, 31015.    _Diagnosis._--Ramus of medium size to small for the genus; lower incisor  broad, moderately recurved; diastemal region broad; anterior median fold  between anterior labial conulid and anterior lingual conulid of m1 deep;  primary first fold between anteroconulid and protoconid of m2 deep;  cingular ridge (ectolophid) at entrance to posteroexternal reentrant  valley (major fold, see Figure 2) between protoconid and hypoconid of m1  and m2; average and extreme measurements of lower molar row of eight  specimens are, 2.65 (2.5-2.7).    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. brachygnathus_, see account of  that species. From _B. rexroadi_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: anterior  median fold of m1 deeper; incisor narrower; diastemal region broader;  coronoid process broader and better developed; cingular ridges  (ectolophids and mesolophids) more pronounced in their development;  incisors less prooedont, more retrodont.    From _B. kolbi_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: crowns of molars  narrower; incisors less prooedont; cingular ridges (ectolophids and  mesolophids) of m1 and m2 more pronounced in their development.    From _B. minimus_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: incisor less  procumbent; masseteric ridge extending farther anteriorly; anterior  cingulum of m2 slightly larger.    From _B. musculus_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: over-all size of jaw  and molar row less; diastema more acutely curved; incisors shorter;  anterior median fold of m1 slightly deeper.    From _B. taylori_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: m1 and m2 smaller;  cingular ridges in m1 and m2 more pronounced; anterolingual conulid  farther forward; incisors shorter, more prooedont; molar teeth depressed,  less hypsodont; diastemal region broader, more acutely curved;  masseteric ridge not extending so far anteriorly.    _Remarks._--_B. sawrockensis_ is the oldest known pygmy mouse. The  extreme development of the anterior median fold between the  anterolingual conulid and the anterolabial conulid is regarded as a  primitive feature in the pygmy mice. In this character, the Recent  species can be traced back in time through _B. minimus_ to _B.  sawrockensis_. _B. sawrockensis_ resembles _Calomys laucha_ of South  America in general conformation of jaw and tooth structure. The molars  of _sawrockensis_ are smaller than those of _C. laucha_, and the  anterolingual conulid of _sawrockensis_ is farther forward.      =Baiomys rexroadi= Hibbard        _Baiomys rexroadi_ Hibbard, Amer.
