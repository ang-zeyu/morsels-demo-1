She began the process of changing her brain  impressions. If she heard noises that annoyed her she would use her  will to direct her attention toward dropping resistance to the  noises, and in order to drop her mental resistance she gave her  attention to loosening out the bodily contractions. Finally she  became interested in the new process as in a series of deep and true  experiments. Of course her living and intelligent interest enabled  her to gain very much faster, for she not only enjoyed her growing  freedom, but she also enjoyed seeing her experiments work. Nature  always tends toward health, and if we stop interfering with her she  will get us well.    There is just this difference between the healing of a physical sore  and the healing of strained and irritated nerves With the one our  bodies are healed, and things go on in them about the same as  before. With the other, every use of the will to free ourselves from  the irritation and its cause not only enables us to get free from  the nervous illness, but in addition brings us new nerve vigor.    When nervous illness is met deeply enough and in the normal way, the  result is that the nerves become stronger than ever before.    Often the effect of nervous strain in women is constant talking.  Talk--talk--talk, and mostly about themselves, their ailments, their  worries, and the hindrances that are put in their way to prevent  their getting well. This talking is not a relief, as people  sometimes feel. It is a direct waste of vigor. But the waste would  be greater if the talk were repressed. The only real help comes when  the talker herself recognizes the strain of her talk and \"loosens\"  into silence.    People must find themselves out to get well--really well--from  nervous suffering. The cause of nervous strain is so often in the  character and in the way we meet circumstances and people that it  seems essential to recognize our mistakes in that direction, and to  face them squarely before we can do our part toward removing the  causes of any nervous illness.    Remember it is not circumstances that keep us ill. It is not people  that cause our illness. It is not our environment that overcomes us.  It is the way we face and deal with circumstances, with people, and  with environment that keeps our nerves irritated or keeps them quiet  and wholesome and steady.    Let me tell the story of two men, both of whom were brought low by  severe nervous breakdown. One complained of his environment,  complained of circumstances, complained of people. Everything and  every one was the cause of his suffering, except himself. The result  was that he weakened his brain by the constant willful and enforced  strain, so that what little health he regained was the result of  Nature's steady and powerful tendency toward health, and in spite of  the man himself.    The other man--to give a practical instance--returned from a journey  taken in order to regain the strength which he had lost from not  knowing how to work. His business agent met him at the railroad  station with a piece of very bad news. Instead of being frightened  and resisting and contracting in every nerve of his body, he took it  at once as an opportunity to drop resistance. He had learned to  relax his body, and by doing relaxing and quieting exercises over  and over he had given himself a brain impression of quiet and \"let  go\" which he could recall at will. Instead of expressing distress at  the bad news he used his will at once to drop resistance and relax;  and, to the surprise of his informant, who had felt that he must  break his bad news as easily as possible, he said \"Anything else?\"  Yes, there was another piece of news about as bad as the first. \"Go  on,\" answered the man who had been sick with nerves; \"tell me  something else.\"    And so he did, until he had told him five different things which  were about as disagreeable and painful to hear as could have been.  For every bit of news our friend used his will with decision to drop  the resistance, which would, of course, at once arise in response to  all that seemed to go against him.    He had, of course, to work at intervals for long afterward to keep  free from the resistance; but the habit is getting more and more  established as life goes on with him, and the result is a brain  clearer than ever before in his life, a power of nerve which is a  surprise to every one about him, and a most successful business  career.    The success in business is, however, a minor matter. His brain would  have cleared and his nerve strengthened just the same if what might  be called the business luck had continued to go against him, as it  seemed to do for the first few months after his recovery. That  everything did go against him for some time was the greatest  blessing he could have had. The way he met all the reverses  increased his nerve power steadily and consistently.    These two men are fair examples of two extremes. The first one did  not know how to meet life. If he had had the opportunity to learn he  might have done as well as the other. The second had worked and  studied to help himself out of nerves, and had found the true secret  of doing it.    Some men, however, and, I regret to say, more women, have the  weakening habit so strong upon them that they are unwilling to learn  how to get well, even when they have the opportunity. It seems so  strange to see people suffer intensely--and be unwilling to face and  follow the only way that will lead them out of their torture.    The trouble is we want our own way and nervous health, too, and with  those who have once broken down nervously the only chance of  permanent health is through learning to drop the strain of  resistance when things do not go their way. This is proved over and  over by the constant relapse into \"nerves\" which comes to those who  have simply been healed over. Even with those who appear to have  been well for some time, if they have not acquired the habit of  dropping their mental and physical tension you can always detect an  overcare for themselves which means dormant fear--or even active  fear in the background.    There are some wounds which the surgeons keep open, even though the  process is most painful, because they know that to heal really they  must heal from the inside. Healing over on the outside only means  decay underneath, and eventual death. This is in most cases exactly  synonymous with the healing of broken-down nerves. They must be  healed in causes to be permanently cured. Sometimes the change that  comes in the process is so great that it is like reversing an  engine.    If the little woman whom I mentioned first had practiced relaxing  and quieting exercises every day for years, and had not used the  quiet impression gained by the exercises to help her in dropping  mental resistances, she never would have gained her health.    Concentrating steadily on dropping the tension of the body is very  radically helpful in dropping resistance from the mind, and the  right idea is to do the exercises over and over until the impression  of quiet openness is, by constant repetition, so strong with us that  we can recall it at will whenever we need it. Finally, after  repeated tests, we gain the habit of meeting the difficulties of  life without strain--first in little ways, and then in larger ways.    The most quieting, relaxing, and strengthening of all exercises for  the nerves comes in deep and rhythmic breathing, and in voice  exercises in connection with it. Nervous strain is more evident in a  voice than in any other expressive part of man or woman. It  sometimes seems as if all other relaxing exercises were mainly  useful because of opening a way for us to breathe better. There is a  pressure on every part of the body when we inhale, and a consequent  reaction when we exhale, and the more passive the body is when we  take our deep breaths the more freely and quietly the blood can  circulate all the way through it, and, of course, all nervous and  muscular contraction impairs circulation, and all impaired  circulation emphasizes nervous contraction.    To any one who is suffering from \"nerves,\" in a lesser or greater  degree, it could not fail to be of very great help to take half an  hour in the morning, lie flat on the back, with the body as loose  and heavy as it can be made, and then study taking gentle, quiet,  and rhythmic breaths, long and short. Try to have the body so loose  and open and responsive that it will open as you inhale and relax as  you exhale, just as a rubber bag would. Of course, it will take  time, but the refreshing quiet is sure to come if the practice is  repeated regularly for a long enough time, and eventually we would  no more miss it than we would go without our dinner.    We must be careful after each deep, long breath to rest quietly and  let our lungs do as they please. Be careful to begin the breaths  delicately and gently, to inhale with the same gentleness with which  we begin, and to make the change from inhaling to exhaling with the  greatest delicacy possible--keeping the body loose.    For the shorter breaths we can count three, or five, or ten to  inhale, and the same number to exhale, until we have the rhythm  established, and then go on breathing without counting, as if we  were sound asleep. Always aim for gentleness and delicacy. If we  have not half an hour to spare to lie quietly and breathe we can  practice the breathing while we walk. It is wonderful how we detect  strain and resistance in our breath, and the restfulness which comes  when we breathe so gently that the breath seems to come and go  without our volition brings new life with it.

However, to reduce animal sociability to  love and sympathy means to reduce its generality and its importance,  just as human ethics based upon love and personal sympathy only have  contributed to narrow the comprehension of the moral feeling as a whole.  It is not love to my neighbour--whom I often do not know at all--which  induces me to seize a pail of water and to rush towards his house when I  see it on fire; it is a far wider, even though more vague feeling or  instinct of human solidarity and sociability which moves me. So it is  also with animals. It is not love, and not even sympathy (understood in  its proper sense) which induces a herd of ruminants or of horses to form  a ring in order to resist an attack of wolves; not love which induces  wolves to form a pack for hunting; not love which induces kittens or  lambs to play, or a dozen of species of young birds to spend their days  together in the autumn; and it is neither love nor personal sympathy  which induces many thousand fallow-deer scattered over a territory as  large as France to form into a score of separate herds, all marching  towards a given spot, in order to cross there a river. It is a feeling  infinitely wider than love or personal sympathy--an instinct that has  been slowly developed among animals and men in the course of an  extremely long evolution, and which has taught animals and men alike the  force they can borrow from the practice of mutual aid and support, and  the joys they can find in social life.    The importance of this distinction will be easily appreciated by the  student of animal psychology, and the more so by the student of human  ethics. Love, sympathy and self-sacrifice certainly play an immense part  in the progressive development of our moral feelings. But it is not love  and not even sympathy upon which Society is based in mankind. It is the  conscience--be it only at the stage of an instinct--of human solidarity.  It is the unconscious recognition of the force that is borrowed by each  man from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of every  one's happiness upon the happiness of all; and of the sense of justice,  or equity, which brings the individual to consider the rights of every  other individual as equal to his own. Upon this broad and necessary  foundation the still higher moral feelings are developed. But this  subject lies outside the scope of the present work, and I shall only  indicate here a lecture, \"Justice and Morality\" which I delivered in  reply to Huxley's Ethics, and in which the subject has been treated at  some length.    Consequently I thought that a book, written on Mutual Aid as a Law of  Nature and a factor of evolution, might fill an important gap. When  Huxley issued, in 1888, his \"Struggle-for-life\" manifesto (Struggle for  Existence and its Bearing upon Man), which to my appreciation was a very  incorrect representation of the facts of Nature, as one sees them in the  bush and in the forest, I communicated with the editor of the Nineteenth  Century, asking him whether he would give the hospitality of his review  to an elaborate reply to the views of one of the most prominent  Darwinists; and Mr. James Knowles received the proposal with fullest  sympathy. I also spoke of it to W. Bates. \"Yes, certainly; that is true  Darwinism,\" was his reply. \"It is horrible what 'they' have made of  Darwin. Write these articles, and when they are printed, I will write to  you a letter which you may publish.\" Unfortunately, it took me nearly  seven years to write these articles, and when the last was published,  Bates was no longer living.    After having discussed the importance of mutual aid in various classes  of animals, I was evidently bound to discuss the importance of the same  factor in the evolution of Man. This was the more necessary as there are  a number of evolutionists who may not refuse to admit the importance of  mutual aid among animals, but who, like Herbert Spencer, will refuse to  admit it for Man. For primitive Man--they maintain--war of each against  all was the law of life. In how far this assertion, which has been too  willingly repeated, without sufficient criticism, since the times of  Hobbes, is supported by what we know about the early phases of human  development, is discussed in the chapters given to the Savages and the  Barbarians.    The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were  developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses,  during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the  next village-community period, and the immense influence which these  early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of  mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches  to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most  interesting period--the free medieval city republics, of which the  universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet  been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief  the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by  mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern  society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle: \"every one for  himself, and the State for all,\" but which it never has succeeded, nor  will succeed in realizing.    It may be objected to this book that both animals and men are  represented in it under too favourable an aspect; that their sociable  qualities are insisted upon, while their anti-social and self-asserting  instincts are hardly touched upon. This was, however, unavoidable. We  have heard so much lately of the \"harsh, pitiless struggle for life,\"  which was said to be carried on by every animal against all other  animals, every \"savage\" against all other \"savages,\" and every civilized  man against all his co-citizens--and these assertions have so much  become an article of faith--that it was necessary, first of all, to  oppose to them a wide series of facts showing animal and human life  under a quite different aspect. It was necessary to indicate the  overwhelming importance which sociable habits play in Nature and in the  progressive evolution of both the animal species and human beings: to  prove that they secure to animals a better protection from their  enemies, very often facilities for getting food and (winter provisions,  migrations, etc.), longevity, therefore a greater facility for the  development of intellectual faculties; and that they have given to men,  in addition to the same advantages, the possibility of working out those  institutions which have enabled mankind to survive in its hard struggle  against Nature, and to progress, notwithstanding all the vicissitudes of  its history. It is a book on the law of Mutual Aid, viewed at as one of  the chief factors of evolution--not on all factors of evolution and  their respective values; and this first book had to be written, before  the latter could become possible.    I should certainly be the last to underrate the part which the  self-assertion of the individual has played in the evolution of mankind.  However, this subject requires, I believe, a much deeper treatment than  the one it has hitherto received. In the history of mankind, individual  self-assertion has often been, and continually is, something quite  different from, and far larger and deeper than, the petty, unintelligent  narrow-mindedness, which, with a large class of writers, goes for  \"individualism\" and \"self-assertion.\" Nor have history-making  individuals been limited to those whom historians have represented as  heroes. My intention, consequently, is, if circumstances permit it, to  discuss separately the part taken by the self-assertion of the  individual in the progressive evolution of mankind. I can only make in  this place the following general remark:--When the Mutual Aid  institutions--the tribe, the village community, the guilds, the medieval  city--began, in the course of history, to lose their primitive  character, to be invaded by parasitic growths, and thus to become  hindrances to progress, the revolt of individuals against these  institutions took always two different aspects. Part of those who rose  up strove to purify the old institutions, or to work out a higher form  of commonwealth, based upon the same Mutual Aid principles; they tried,  for instance, to introduce the principle of \"compensation,\" instead of  the lex talionis, and later on, the pardon of offences, or a still  higher ideal of equality before the human conscience, in lieu of  \"compensation,\" according to class-value. But at the very same time,  another portion of the same individual rebels endeavoured to break down  the protective institutions of mutual support, with no other intention  but to increase their own wealth and their own powers. In this  three-cornered contest, between the two classes of revolted individuals  and the supporters of what existed, lies the real tragedy of history.  But to delineate that contest, and honestly to study the part played in  the evolution of mankind by each one of these three forces, would  require at least as many years as it took me to write this book.    Of works dealing with nearly the same subject, which have been published  since the publication of my articles on Mutual Aid among Animals, I must  mention The Lowell Lectures on the Ascent of Man, by Henry Drummond  (London, 1894), and The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct, by A.  Sutherland (London, 1898). Both are constructed chiefly on the lines  taken in Buchner's Love, and in the second work the parental and  familial feeling as the sole influence at work in the development of the  moral feelings has been dealt with at some length. A third work dealing  with man and written on similar lines is The Principles of Sociology, by  Prof. F.A."]]]
