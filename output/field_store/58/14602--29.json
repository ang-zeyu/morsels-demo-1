[Illustration: Fig. 1. AN ANGRY ADELIE (Page 3)]    When seen for the first time, the Adelie penguin gives you the  impression of a very smart little man in an evening dress suit, so  absolutely immaculate is he, with his shimmering white front and black  back and shoulders. He stands about two feet five inches in height,  walking very upright on his little legs.    His carriage is confident as he approaches you over the snow, curiosity  in his every movement. When within a yard or two of you, as you stand  silently watching him, he halts, poking his head forward with little  jerky movements, first to one side, then to the other, using his right  and left eye alternately during his inspection. He seems to prefer using  one eye at a time when viewing any near object, but when looking far  ahead, or walking along, he looks straight ahead of him, using both  eyes. He does this, too, when his anger is aroused, holding his head  very high, and appearing to squint at you along his beak, as in  Figure 1.    After a careful inspection, he may suddenly lose all interest in you,  and ruffling up his feathers sink into a doze. Stand still for a minute  till he has settled himself to sleep, then make sound enough to wake him  without startling him, and he opens his eyes, stretching himself, yawns,  then finally walks off, caring no more about you. (Figs. 2 and 3.)    The wings of Adelies, like those of the other penguins, have taken the  form of paddles, and are covered with very fine scale-like feathers.  Their legs being very short, they walk slowly, with a waddling gait, but  can travel at a fair pace over snow or ice by falling forward on to  their breasts, and propelling themselves with all four limbs.    To continue the sketch, I quote two other writers:    M. Racovitza, of the \"Belgica\" expedition, well describes them as  follows:    \"Imagine a little man, standing erect, provided with two broad paddles  instead of arms, with head small in comparison with the plump stout  body; imagine this creature with his back covered with a black coat ...  tapering behind to a pointed tail that drags on the ground, and adorned  in front with a glossy white breast-plate. Have this creature walk on  his two feet, and give him at the same time a droll little waddle, and a  pert movement of the head; you have before you something irresistibly  attractive and comical.\"      [Illustration: Fig. 2. Dozing]      [Illustration: Fig. 3. Waking up, Stretching, and Yawning (Page 3)]    Dr. Louis Gain, of the French Antarctic expedition, gives us the  following description:    \"The Adelie penguin is a brave animal, and rarely flees from danger. If  it happens to be tormented, it faces its aggressor and ruffles the black  feathers which cover its back. Then it takes a stand for combat, the  body straight, the animal erect, the beak in the air, the wings  extended, not losing sight of its enemy.    \"It then makes a sort of purring, a muffled grumbling, to show that it  is not satisfied, and has not lost a bit of its firm resolution to  defend itself. In this guarded position it stays on the spot; sometimes  it retreats, and lying flat on the ground, pushes itself along with all  the force of its claws and wings. Should it be overtaken, instead of  trying to increase its speed, it stops, backs up again to face anew the  peril, and returns to its position of combat. Sometimes it takes the  offensive, throws itself upon its aggressor, whom it punishes with blows  of its beak and wings.\"    The Adelie penguin is excessively curious, taking great pains to inspect  any strange object he may see. When we were waiting for the ship to  fetch us home, some of us lived in little tents which we pitched on the  snow about fifty yards from the edge of the sea. Parties of penguins  from Cape Royds rookery frequently landed here, and almost invariably  the first thing they did on seeing our tents, was at once to walk up the  slope and inspect these, walking all round them, and often staying to  doze by them for hours. Some of them, indeed, seemed to enjoy our  companionship. When you pass on the sea-ice anywhere near a party of  penguins, these generally come up to look at you, and we had great  trouble to keep them away from the sledge dogs when these were tethered  in rows near the hut at Cape Evans. The dogs killed large numbers of  them in consequence, in spite of all we could do to prevent this.    The Adelies, as will be seen in these pages, are extremely brave, and  though panic occasionally overtakes them, I have seen a bird return time  after time to attack a seaman who was brutally sending it flying by  kicks from his sea-boot, before I arrived to interfere. An exact  description of the plumage of the Adelie penguins will be found in the  Appendix, as it is more especially of their habits that I intend to  treat in this work.    Before describing these, and with a view to making them more  intelligible to the general reader, I will proceed to a short  explanation.    The Adelie penguins spend their summer and bring forth their young in  the far South. Nesting on the shores of the Antarctic continent, and on  the islands of the Antarctic seas, they are always close to the water,  being dependent on the sea for their food, as are all Antarctic fauna;  the frozen regions inland, for all practical purposes, being barren of  both animal and vegetable life.    Their requirements are few: they seek no shelter from the terrible  Antarctic gales, their rookeries in most cases being in open wind-swept  spots. In fact, three of the four rookeries I visited were possibly in  the three most windy regions of the Antarctic. The reason for this is  that only wind-swept places are so kept bare of snow that solid ground  and pebbles for making nests are to be found.    When the chicks are hatched and fully fledged, they are taught to swim,  and when this is accomplished and they can catch food for themselves,  both young and old leave the Southern limits of the sea, and make their  way to the pack-ice out to the northward, thus escaping the rigors and  darkness of the Antarctic winter, and keeping where they will find the  open water which they need. For in the winter the seas where they nest  are completely covered by a thick sheet of ice which does not break out  until early in the following summer. Much of this ice is then borne  northward by tide and wind, and accumulates to form the vast rafts of  what is called \"pack-ice,\" many hundreds of miles in extent, which lie  upon the surface of the Antarctic seas. (Fig. 4.)    It is to this mass of floating sea-ice that the Adelie penguins make  their way in the autumn, but as their further movements here are at  present something of a mystery, the question will be discussed at  greater length presently.    When young and old leave the rookery at the end of the breeding season,  the new ice has not yet been formed, and their long journey to the pack  has to be made by water, but they are wonderful swimmers and seem to  cover the hundreds of miles quite easily.    Arrived on the pack, the first year's birds remain there for two  winters. It is not until after their first moult, the autumn following  their departure from the rookery, that they grow the distinguishing mark  of the adult, black feathers replacing the white plumage which has  hitherto covered the throat.    The spring following this, and probably every spring for the rest of  their lives, they return South to breed, performing their journey, very  often, not only by water, but on foot across many miles of frozen sea.      [Illustration: Fig. 4. Pack Ice (on which the Adelies winter)    Two Weddell Seals are seen on a Floe]      [Illustration: Fig. 5. Heavy Seas in the Autumn (Page 10)]    For those birds who nest in the southernmost rookeries, such as Cape  Crozier, this journey must mean for them a journey of at least four  hundred miles by water, and an unknown but considerable distance on foot  over ice.    As I am about to describe the manners and customs of Adelie penguins at  the Cape Adare rookery, I will give a short description of that spot.    Cape Adare is situated in lat. 71 deg. 14' S. long. 170 deg. 10' E., and is a  neck of land jutting out from the sheer and ice-bound foot-hills of  South Victoria Land northwards for a distance of some twenty miles.    For its whole length, the sides of this Cape rise sheer out of the sea,  affording no foothold except at the extreme end, where a low beach has  been formed, nestling against the steep side of the cliff which here  rises almost perpendicularly to a height of over 1000 feet.    Hurricanes frequently sweep this beach, so that snow never settles there  for long, and as it is composed of basaltic material freely strewn with  rounded pebbles, it forms a convenient nesting site, and it was on this  spot that I made the observations set forth in the following pages.    Viewed before the penguins' arrival in the spring, and after recent  winds had swept the last snowfalls away, the rookery is seen to be  composed of a series of undulations and mounds, or \"knolls,\" while  several sheets of ice, varying in size up to some hundreds of yards in  length and one hundred yards in width, cover lower lying ground where  lakes of thaw water form in the summer. Though doubtless the ridges and  knolls of the rookery owe their origin mainly to geological phenomena,  their contour has been much added to as, year by year, the penguins have  chosen the higher eminences for their nests; because their guano, which  thickly covers the higher ground, has protected this from weathering and  the denuding effect of the hurricanes which pass over it at certain  seasons and tend to carry away the small fragments of ground that have  been split up by the frost.    The shores of this beach are protected by a barrier of ice-floes which  are stranded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#2)"],[1,", having discovered the island  of Trinidad and the mainland of South America on the 31st of July  1498, arrived at San Domingo in the end of August. In October he sent  five ships to Spain with the news of the discovery, a chart of the  new coast-line and islands, and a report containing mention of the  existence of pearls. These precious documents fell into the hands of  Bishop Fonseca, who showed them to Hojeda, a man whom he favoured. The  Bishop suggested that his _protege_ should equip an expedition to reap  all the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of the Admiral,  and granted him a licence. Hojeda was nothing loth, but he was in want of  funds, and only succeeded in fitting out four vessels by promising shares  of the expected profits to persons in Seville and Cadiz who would advance  money. Vespucci seems to have been one of these promoters of Hojeda's  voyage. Las Casas supposes that he was taken on board as a merchant who  had contributed to the expenses, and also possibly on account of his  theoretical knowledge of cosmography, of which he doubtless made the most.    As there is no doubt that Vespucci wrote the famous letters from Lisbon,  we may gather some idea of the man from their contents. He was fond  of airing his classical knowledge, though it was a mere smattering;  for he thought that Pliny was the contemporary of Mecaenas,[10] and  that the sculptor Policletus was a painter.[11] On the other hand he  quotes Petrarch, and gives a correct reference to a passage in Dante's  _Inferno_.[12] He was inaccurate in his narratives and regardless of the  truth, as was ably shown by Las Casas,[13] while he habitually assumed the  credit of work which belonged to his superiors; and pretended to knowledge  and influence which he could never have possessed.[14] Though externally  civil and obliging, he harboured jealousy and hatred in his heart,[15]  and was disloyal towards the men under whom he served.[16] Of his natural  ability there can be no doubt. He wrote well, and some of his stories  are capitally told.[17] He must have been a plausible talker, so that,  by such men as Fonseca and Peter Martyr, the theoretical pretender was  taken at the value he put upon himself, and was believed to be a great  pilot and navigator.[18]    He was certainly not a practical navigator, much less a pilot, as the term  was understood in those days. Hojeda, in his evidence, said that he took  with him \"Juan de la Cosa, and Morigo Vespuche, and other pilots\". In  this sentence the \"other pilots\" must be intended to be coupled with  Juan de la Cosa, not with \"Morigo Vespuche\". A man of fifty years of  age could not go to sea for the first time and be a pilot. The thing  would be absurd now, but it would be much more absurd in the fifteenth  century. With the perfectly graduated and adjusted instruments, the  facilities for calculations, and the appliances of all kinds with which  the modern navigator is supplied, the business of the sea may be learnt  more quickly than in former days. Yet no one would now dream of calling  a middle-aged man an expert navigator because he had read a book on  astronomy and made one or two voyages. In the fifteenth century the  instruments were of the roughest kind, and much more depended on the  skill and intuitive instincts of the seaman himself, qualifications  which could only be acquired by a long training and many years of  experience. Vespucci has the assurance to talk of his astrolabe and  quadrant and sea chart, and to write disparagingly of the trained  pilots of whom he was jealous.[19] But his own writings make it clear  to any seaman that the Florentine contractor was merely a landlubber  with a smattering of Sacrobosco or some other work _De Sphaera_, which  enabled him to impose upon his brother landsmen by talking of climates,  of steering by winds, and of measuring diameters of fixed stars. Hojeda  certainly did not ship a pilot when he took Amerigo Vespucci on board,  but a very clever and very plausible landsman with a keen eye to his  own interests.    Alonzo de Hojeda left Cadiz, with four vessels, on May 20th, 1499.  Endeavouring to steer by the chart of Columbus, he made a landfall at  some distance to the south of Paria, off the mouths of the Orinoco.  Coasting along to the northward, he came to the Gulf of Paria, went out  by the Boca del Drago, and visited the island of Margarita. He then  proceeded along the coast of the continent, visited Curacoa, which he  called the \"Isla de los Gigantes\", and came to the Gulf of Maracaibo,  where he found a village built on piles, which was named Venezuela, or  Little Venice. His most western point was the province of Cuquibacoa and  the Cabo de la Vela. His discovery consisted of 200 leagues of coast to  the west of Paria. Along this coast Hojeda obtained gold and pearls. He  had an encounter with the natives, in which one Spaniard was killed  and about twenty wounded, the place being named \"Puerto Flechado\". He  refitted in a harbour where the people were friendly, and which Amerigo  considered to be the best harbour in the world. Las Casas believed this  to have been Cariaco, near Cumana. On leaving the coast Hojeda proceeded  to Espanola, where he behaved in the outrageous manner described by Las  Casas,[20] remaining two months and seventeen days, from September 5th,  1499, to November 22nd, finally visiting some islands, probably the  Bahamas,[21] and carrying off 200 natives as slaves. Hojeda returned to  Cadiz in February 1500. In the same year Juan de la Cosa, the pilot of the  expedition, compiled his famous map of the world, on which he delineated  this new coast-line from Paria to Cabo de la Vela, the extreme point  of continental land that was known up to that time. On this coast-line  he placed twenty-two names, including the Boca del Drago, Margarita,  the \"Isla de los Gigantes\", the Lake of Venezuela (or Little Venice),  and the Cabo de la Vela. The map of Juan de la Cosa is important when  we come to the consideration of the statements in the letters of Vespucci.    The Florentine, on his return from this voyage, took up his residence  at Seville. Here, according to his own account, he received a message  from the King of Portugal, asking him to come to Lisbon. The bearer of  the message was a countryman of his own, named Giuliano di Bartolomeo  di Giocondo, and Vespucci would have us believe that the King attached  importance to his entering the Portuguese service. The Visconde de  Santarem has searched the archives in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, and  all the Portuguese documents in Paris, without once meeting with the  name of Vespucci. This absence of all official allusion to him points  to the conclusion that he never held any important position as pilot or  commander. He asserts that he joined a Portuguese expedition of discovery  along the coast of Brazil, which sailed on March 10th, 1501, and returned  on September 7th, 1502.[22] In the following March or April (1503)  he addressed a letter to the head of the mercantile house to which he  had belonged, Lorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici, giving his account of  the voyage. On May 10th, 1503, he sailed from Lisbon on another voyage,  returning on June 28th, 1504.    In the following September he finished writing the famous letter  containing an account of his alleged four voyages. The original Italian  version was sent to a magnificent Lord, who is supposed to have been Piero  Soderini, Gonfaloniere of Florence in 1504; and a French translation  was sent to Rene, Duke of Lorraine. Soon afterwards Vespucci left the  Portuguese service and returned to Spain.    In February 1505, the Admiral, Christopher Columbus, was laid up with  an illness at Seville, while his brother and his son Diego were at  court. Vespucci, having returned to Spain from Lisbon, went to pay his  respects to the great discoverer, and the Admiral entrusted him with a  letter to his son. \"The bearer of this letter\", wrote Columbus, \"is going  to court on matters relating to navigation. He always showed a desire to  please me, and he is a very respectable man. Fortune has been adverse  to him, as to many others. His labours have not been so profitable to  him as might have been expected. He leaves me with the desire to do  me service, if it should be in his power.\" Vespucci had evidently been  complaining to the Admiral that his Portuguese service had been a failure,  and had brought him no profit. He went on to the court of Ferdinand,  and soon obtained employment; receiving letters of naturalisation on  the 24th of April 1505[23]; but there is no record of his ever having  been of any service to the Admiral. He was very plausible, and knew how  to ingratiate himself with men in power. It was intended to send him on  a voyage of discovery with Vicente Yanez Pinzon, and in 1506 and 1507  he was engaged in purchasing provisions for the voyage; but the idea of  despatching this expedition was abandoned in 1508.[24]    It has been supposed, from a sentence in a letter from Hieronimo Vianelo,  the Venetian Ambassador, dated at Burgos on December 23rd, 1506, that  Vespucci accompanied Juan de la Cosa on a voyage of discovery to the  Indies during that year.[25] \"The two ships have arrived from the Indies  which went on a voyage of discovery under Juan Biscaino and Almerigo  Fiorentino.\" But Vianelo must have been misinformed. There are documentary  proofs that Vespucci was in Spain until August 1506. It is highly  probable that the voluble Florentine retailed the story of Juan de la  Cosa's voyage in such a way as to give Vianelo the impression that the  narrator took part in it himself. The story of the voyage, as we find it  in the letter of the Venetian Ambassador, is quite in Vespucci's manner.    On the 6th of August 1508, Amerigo Vespucci received the appointment of  Chief Pilot (_Piloto Mayor_) of Spain, with a salary of 75,000 maravedis  a year.[26] The \"Real Titulo\","]]]
