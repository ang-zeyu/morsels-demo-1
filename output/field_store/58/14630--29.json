Never did he by a single action belie the kindly expression of his face.    He had a frank air, a lively, intelligent eye, and large, red lips.    Born in the neighborhood of Aix, he betrayed, when animated, a slight  Provencal accent that gave a peculiar flavor to his genial humor.    The news of the robbery had extremely agitated him, for his usually  florid face was now quite pale.    \"What is this I hear? what has happened?\" he said to the clerks, who  respectfully stood aside when he entered the room.    The sound of M. Fauvel's voice inspired the cashier with the factitious  energy of a great crisis. The dreaded and decisive moment had come; he  arose, and advanced toward his chief.    \"Monsieur,\" he began, \"having, as you know, a payment to make this  morning, I yesterday drew from the Bank of France three hundred and  fifty thousand francs.\"    \"Why yesterday, monsieur?\" interrupted the banker. \"I think I have a  hundred times ordered you to wait until the day of the payment.\"    \"I know it, monsieur, and I did wrong to disobey you. But the evil is  done. Yesterday evening I locked the money up: it has disappeared, and  yet the safe has not been broken open.\"    \"You must be mad!\" exclaimed M. Fauvel: \"you are dreaming!\"    These few words destroyed all hope; but the very horror of the situation  gave Prosper, not the coolness of a matured resolution, but that sort  of stupid, stolid indifference which often results from unexpected  catastrophes.    It was with apparent calmness that he replied:    \"I am not mad; neither, unfortunately, am I dreaming: I am simply  telling the truth.\"    This tranquillity at such a moment appeared to exasperate M. Fauvel. He  seized Prosper by the arm, and shook him roughly.    \"Speak!\" he cried out. \"Speak! who do you pretend to say opened the  safe? Answer me!\"    \"I cannot say.\"    \"No one but you and I knew the secret word. No one but you and myself  had keys.\"    This was a formal accusation; at least, all the auditors present so  understood it.    Yet Prosper's strange calmness never left him for an instant. He quietly  released himself from M. Fauvel's grasp, and very slowly said:    \"In other words, monsieur, I am the only person who could have taken  this money.\"    \"Unhappy wretch!\"    Prosper drew himself to his full height, and, looking M. Fauvel full in  the face, added:    \"Or you!\"    The banker made a threatening gesture; and there is no knowing what  would have happened if they had not been interrupted by loud and angry  voices at the entry-door.    A man insisted upon entering in spite of the protestations of the  errand-boys, and succeeded in forcing his way in. It was M. de Clameran.    The clerks stood looking on, bewildered and motionless. The silence was  profound, solemn.    It was easy to see that some terrible question, a question of life or  death, was being weighed by all these men.    The iron-founder did not appear to observe anything unusual. He  advanced, and without lifting his hat said, in the same impertinent  tone:    \"It is after ten o'clock, gentlemen.\"    No one answered; and M. de Clameran was about to continue, when, turning  around, he for the first time saw the banker, and walking up to him  said:    \"Well, monsieur, I congratulate myself upon finding you in at last. I  have been here once before this morning, and found the cash-room not  opened, the cashier not arrived, and you absent.\"    \"You are mistaken, monsieur, I was in my office.\"    \"At any rate, I was told you were out; that gentleman over there assured  me of the fact.\"    And the iron-founder pointed out Cavaillon.    \"However, that is of little importance,\" he went on to say. \"I return,  and this time not only the cash-room is closed, but I am refused  admittance to the banking-house, and find myself compelled to force my  way in. Be so good as to tell me whether I can have my money.\"    M. Fauvel's flushed face turned pale with anger as he listened to this  insolence; yet he controlled himself.    \"I would be obliged to you monsieur, for a short delay.\"    \"I thought you told me--\"    \"Yes, yesterday. But this morning, this very instant, I find I have been  robbed of three hundred and fifty thousand francs.\"    M. de Clameran bowed ironically, and said:    \"Shall I have to wait long?\"    \"Long enough for me to send to the bank.\"    Then turning his back on the iron-founder, M. Fauvel said to his  cashier:    \"Write and send as quickly as possible to the bank an order for three  hundred thousand francs. Let the messenger take a carriage.\"    Prosper remained motionless.    \"Do you hear me?\" said the banker angrily.    The cashier trembled; he seemed as if trying to shake off a terrible  nightmare.    \"It is useless to send,\" he said in a measured tone; \"we owe this  gentleman three hundred thousand francs, and we have less than one  hundred thousand in the bank.\"    M. de Clameran evidently expected this answer, for he muttered:    \"Naturally.\"    Although he pronounced this word, his voice, his manner, his face  clearly said:    \"This comedy is well acted; but nevertheless it is a comedy, and I don't  intend to be duped by it.\"    Alas! After Prosper's answer, and the iron-founder's coarsely expressed  opinion, the clerks knew not what to think.    The fact was, that Paris had just been startled by several financial  crashes. The thirst for speculation caused the oldest and most reliable  houses to totter. Men of the most unimpeachable honor had to sacrifice  their pride, and go from door to door imploring aid.    Credit, that rare bird of security and peace, rested with none, but  stood with upraised wings, ready to fly off at the first rumor of  suspicion.    Therefore this idea of a comedy arranged beforehand between the banker  and his cashier might readily occur to the minds of people who, if not  suspicious, were at least aware of all the expedients resorted to  by speculators in order to gain time, which with them often meant  salvation.    M. Fauvel had had too much experience not to instantly divine the  impression produced by Prosper's answer; he read the most mortifying  doubt on the faces around him.    \"Oh! don't be alarmed, monsieur,\" said he to M. de Clameran, \"this house  has other resources. Be kind enough to await my return.\"    He left the room, went up the narrow steps leading to his study, and  in a few minutes returned, holding in his hand a letter and a bundle of  securities.    \"Here, quick, Couturier!\" he said to one of his clerks, \"take my  carriage, which is waiting at the door, and go with monsieur to M. de  Rothschild's. Hand him this letter and these securities; in exchange,  you will receive three hundred thousand francs, which you will hand to  this gentleman.\"    The iron-founder was visibly disappointed; he seemed desirous of  apologizing for his impertinence.    \"I assure you, monsieur, that I had no intention of giving offence. Our  relations, for some years, have been such that I hope--\"    \"Enough, monsieur,\" interrupted the banker, \"I desire no apologies. In  business, friendship counts for nothing. I owe you money: I am not ready  to pay: you are pressing: you have a perfect right to demand what is  your own. Follow my clerk: he will pay you your money.\"    Then he turned to his clerks who stood curiously gazing on, and said:    \"As for you, gentlemen, be kind enough to resume your desks.\"    In an instant the room was cleared of everyone except the clerks who  belonged there; and they sat at their desks with their noses almost  touching the paper before them, as if too absorbed in their work to  think of anything else.    Still excited by the events so rapidly succeeding each other, M.  Andre Fauvel walked up and down the room with quick, nervous steps,  occasionally uttering some low exclamation.    Prosper remained leaning against the door, with pale face and fixed  eyes, looking as if he had lost the faculty of thinking.    Finally the banker, after a long silence, stopped short before Prosper;  he had determined upon the line of conduct he would pursue.    \"We must have an explanation,\" he said. \"Let us go into your office.\"    The cashier mechanically obeyed without a word; and his chief followed  him, taking the precaution to close the door after him.    The cash-room bore no evidences of a successful burglary. Everything was  in perfect order; not even a paper was misplaced.    The safe was open, and on the top shelf lay several rouleaus of gold,  overlooked or disdained by the thieves.    M. Fauvel, without troubling himself to examine anything, took a seat,  and ordered his cashier to do the same. He had entirely recovered his  equanimity, and his countenance wore its usual kind expression.    \"Now that we are alone, Prosper,\" he said, \"have you nothing to tell  me?\"    The cashier started, as if surprised at the question. \"Nothing,  monsieur, that I have not already told you.\"    \"What, nothing? Do you persist in asserting a fable so absurd and  ridiculous that no one can possibly believe it? It is folly! Confide in  me: it is your only chance of salvation. I am your employer, it is true;  but I am before and above all your friend, your best and truest friend.  I cannot forget that in this very room, fifteen years ago, you were  intrusted to me by your father; and ever since that day have I had cause  to congratulate myself on possessing so faithful and efficient a  clerk. Yes, it is fifteen years since you came to me. I was then just  commencing the foundation of my fortune. You have seen it gradually  grow, step by step, from almost nothing to its present height. As my  wealth increased, I endeavored to better your condition; you, who,  although so young, are the oldest of my clerks. At each inventory of my  fortune, I increased your salary.\"    Never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#2)"],[1,"(Oreortyx pictus plumiferus)    The range of the plumed partridge is throughout the entire length of the  Sierra Nevadas and of the coast range south of San Francisco bay into  Lower California, where it intergrades with the San Pedro partridge,  but it does not cross the Colorado river and enter Arizona or the  mainland of Mexico. This species begins its migrations early in the  spring, keeping close to the snow line until they reach altitudes as  high as 7000 to 8000 feet, where they nest and rear their young. In the  fall, just before the winter rains begin, they commence their migrations  down again to the foothills, where they remain until the following  spring. Unless driven by unusually heavy snows, they rarely descend  lower than 2000 to 3000 feet above sea level.      SAN PEDRO MARTIR MOUNTAIN QUAIL    (Oreortyx pictus confinis)    The San Pedro partridge, so named by the ornithologist, is a resident  of the San Pedro Martir mountains of Lower California, and ascends to  a height of ten thousand feet, and is rarely seen lower than five  thousand feet above the sea.    I want to say here that no work on ornithology that I have seen,  describes the San Pedro partridge properly. Most likely this is the  result of an examination of the intergrades only, for they do  intergrade with the California species to the northward. The two  species first mentioned have the plume from one and a half to two and  a half inches long and nearly round in form. The plume of the San  Pedro partridge is flat, about three-sixteenths of an inch wide and  from three and a half to four and a half inches long. The plume of the  other varieties is erectile, but that of the San Pedro denizen is soft  and falls down the side. In all species both sexes are alike, with the  exception that the plume of the female is generally a trifle the  shorter; but this can not always be relied upon to distinguish the  sex.    Generally speaking there is not much sport in hunting the mountain  quail, but I have at times had a bevy scattered in ferns, and in such  cases had very good sport with them with a dog, and found them to lie  very well. They are about a half larger than the valley quail, and as  a table bird much more succulent.    =Color=--Top of head, back of neck and breast, an ashy blue, darker on  the back of the neck than the breast; back and wings, inclining to  olive brown, in the Coast species with a slight reddish tinge; abdomen  and flanks, rich chestnut barred with black and white; under tail  feathers, black; entire throat, reaching well down onto the breast,  rich chestnut, bordered with white; chin, white; bill, black. The two  California species have two round, black plumes falling gracefully  over the back of the neck, but erectile when excited. These plumes  will vary from one and a half to two and a half inches in length. The  Lower California species have two flat, black plumes about  three-sixteenths of an inch in width and from three and a half to five  inches long. Both sexes are alike in all species.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest, like that of all gallinaceous birds, is a  depression on the ground, hidden among a bunch of bushes or under a  log, surrounded by a few dry leaves. The number of eggs will average  about a dozen, rather oval in shape and of a light ochreous color.    =Measurements=--Length (see diagram), will average about 10 inches;  wing 5-1/2, bill about 5/8 of an inch.        [Illustration: CALIFORNIA VALLEY QUAIL                   (Lophortyx californicus vallicola)]      THE CALIFORNIA VALLEY QUAIL    (Lophortyx californicus vallicola)    There are two varieties of the California valley quail. They are  distinguished not so much by the slight difference in color as in the  very marked difference in their habits.    As with the mountain quail the ornithologist has taken the wrong bird  for the type, making the larger race the subspecies. To the species  (=Lophortyx californicus=) inhabiting the foothills of the Coast range  north of the bay of San Francisco and into western Oregon, the  ornithologist has given the English name California partridge. This  species is a lover of damp places and rank growths of underbrush and  ferns. The subspecies (=Lophortyx californicus vallicola=), to which  has been given the name valley partridge, ranges from central Oregon  throughout the great valleys of California, the foothills of the  western slope of the Sierras, both sides of the Coast range south from  San Francisco bay and throughout the peninsula of Lower California.  Like the mountain quail it does not cross the Colorado desert into  Arizona or the mainland of Mexico. Nevertheless it has a wider range  than any other one species of game bird.    Of all the game birds of America the California valley quail is the  most resourceful and characterized by the greatest cunning. Having  hunted these birds for upward of fifty years and practically  throughout their entire range, I freely give them credit for knowing  more tricks and being able to concoct more schemes of deception than  all the rest of the =tetraonidae= combined, and this resourcefulness  has led to most of the false statements regarding their behavior and  gameness. It has been said by writers, who should know better, that a  dog is no use in hunting them because of their disposition to run. Any  bird with more game than a fool-hen will either flush or run where  there is no undercover in which to hide, and the valley quail being so  often found in dry, open places or chaparral devoid of undercover,  will either flush or run until it finds suitable hiding grounds.    But give the valley quail cover in which to hide and it can and will  out-hide any game bird except the Montezuma quail of Mexico. In fact it  is this remarkable faculty of hugging the ground until it is almost  stepped upon that has led, more than anything else, to its false  reputation as a runner. The man who hunts the valley quail without a  dog--and most of its detractors do--can walk through a patch of good  cover with a hundred birds scattered in it for an hour or more and not  get up a half dozen. Unlike the bobwhite or the Montezuma quail of  Mexico, the valley quail bunches in the fall. These bunches will  contain anywhere from two or three broods to two or three hundred  individuals, and sometimes even thousands, and they seem to understand  that the larger the bunch the greater the necessity for avoiding  pursuit. They are fond of the open places and the bare hill-tops and  when driven from these, being a brush bird, they very naturally seek  the brush. If there is no grass or suitable undercover in which to  hide they will continue to work their way through it or double back on  their pursuers until hiding places are found, when they will hug the  ground so closely that even a good dog must pass reasonably near to  them before he will detect their scent. The man who hunts without a  dog generally passes through the cover into which his bevy has  settled, continues his walk for a mile or more, then sits down,  filling the air with a sulphurous streak of strong sounding words as  he curses the game little birds for running, while the resourceful  little fellows, closely hid, laugh over the security a false  reputation has given them.    There has been a great deal written about the ability of quail to  withhold their scent, and many theories have been advanced. That all  game birds do lose their scent temporarily while passing rapidly  through the air I believe to be true, and the valley quail has this  faculty strongly added to its other resources. This too often deceives  the inexperienced man even when hunting with a dog. Where birds have  been flushed into good cover and can not be raised, sit down and take  a smoke, if you like, for twenty minutes or half an hour, then cast in  your dog and you will be rewarded with point after point, where before  your dog failed to detect the slightest scent. After years of  experience with all of the upland birds of the United States and half  of Mexico, I do not hesitate to pronounce the California quail the  chief of them all in gameness, in resourcefulness, and in its general  adaptability to furnish the highest form of upland shooting. But  California quail can not be hunted successfully without a good dog.    The food of the adult California quail, according to an investigation  made by the United States Agricultural Department, through the  examination of the stomachs of 619 birds, taken during every month of  the year, except May, consists of 97 per cent vegetable and 3 per cent  animal matter, the vegetable varying according to the seasons. During  the rainy season, when green vegetation is abundant, grasses and  foliage of various kinds form fully 80 per cent of the entire food,  while in the dry season it forms barely one per cent. In the dry  season weed seeds form as high as 85 per cent of the food; one stomach  examined containing 2144 seeds of various kinds. During the harvesting  season when there is a good deal of grain on the ground, and during  the sowing season, grains form about 6 per cent of the diet. During  the season when wild blackberries, elder and other wild berries are  ripe, these, with a few grapes and a little of some other fruits, form  23 per cent of the food.    During the first week of the life of the young birds, insects of  various kinds make up 75 per cent of their food, but by the time they  are a month old their animal food is no greater than that of the old  birds.    =Color=--Male--Forehead, gray; top and back of head, sooty black,  bordered with white running around from one eye to the other, and this  again has a faint edging of black; throat, black, margined with white;  plume, narrow at the base and wide at the top, consisting of six  black, V-shaped feathers, each folded within the other and curved  forward; back and sides of the neck to the shoulders, deep ashy blue  with the"]]]
