A moment later, and the royal top-gallantsail, topsail and mainsail  disappear from the main mast, upon which appears a regular fore and aft  suit of canvass, consisting of mainsail, gaff topsail, and gaff  top-gallantsail, reducing the vessel to a square rig forward, and a  plain fore and aft rig aft. A few minutes more, and the foremast passed  through the same metamorphose, leaving the \"Sea Witch\" a three-masted  schooner, with fore and aft sails on every mast and every stay. All this  had been accomplished with a celerity that showed the crew to be no  strangers to the manouvres through which they had just passed, each man  requiring to work with marked intelligence. Fifty well drilled men,  thorough sea dogs, can turn a five hundred ton ship \"inside out,\" if the  controlling mind understands his position on the quarter-deck.    \"She wears that dress as though it suited her taste exactly, Mr.  Faulkner,\" said the captain, running his eye over the vessel, and  glancing over the side to mark her headway.    \"Any rig becomes the 'Sea Witch,'\" answered the officer, with evident  pride.    \"That is true,\" returned the captain. \"Luff, sir, luff a bit, so, well,\"  he continued to the man at the helm; \"we will have all of her weatherly  points that site will give.\"    \"The wind is rather more unsteady than it was an hour past,\" said Mr.  Faulkner.    \"Rather puffy, and twice I thought it would haul right about, but here  we have it still from the north'rd and east'rd,\" replied the captain.    \"Here it is again,\" added the mate, as the wind hauled once more.    The immediate object of the change in the vessel's rig, which we have  described, was at once apparent, enabling the vessel to lie nearer the  wind in her course, as well its giving her increased velocity by  bringing more canvass to draw than a square rig could do when close  hauled. But a shrewd observer would have been led to ask, what other  reason, save that of disguise, could have been the actuating motive in  thus giving to the \"Sea Witch\" a double character in her rig? For though  temporary and somewhat important advantage could at times be thus  gained, as we have seen, yet such an object alone would not have  warranted the increased outlay that was necessarily incurred, to say  nothing of the imperative necessity of a vessel's being very strongly  manned in order to enable her to thus change her entire aspect with any  ordinary degree of celerity, and as had just been accomplished.          CHAPTER II.    CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN.      THE watch below, after completing the work which had summoned them for  the time being on deck, tumbled helter-skelter down the fore hatch once  more, and left on the deck of the \"Sea Witch\" about a dozen able seamen  who formed the watch upon deck. A number of these were now gathered in a  knot on the forecastle, and while they were sitting cross-legged,  picking old rope, and preparing it in suitable form for caulking the  ship's seams, one of their number was spinning a yarn, the hero of which  was evidently him who now filled the post of commander on board their  vessel. The object of their remarks, meanwhile, stood once more quietly  leaning over the monkey-rail on the weather side of the quarter-deck,  quite unconscious that he was supplying a theme of entertainment to the  forecastle.    There was an absent expression in his handsome face, a look as though  his heart was far distant from the scene about him, and yet a habit of  watchful caution seemed ever and anon to recall his senses, and his  quick, keen glance would run over the craft from stem to stern with a  searching and comprehensive power that showed him master of his  profession, and worthy his trust. Trust?--what was the trust he held?  Surely, no legitimate commerce could warrant the outfit of such a vessel  as he controlled. A man-of-war could hardly have been more fully  equipped with means of offence and defence. Amidship, beneath that long  boat, was a long, heavy metalled gun that worked on a traverse, and  which could command nearly every point of the compass, while the ship  kept her course. Just inside the rise of the low quarter-deck--the cabin  being entered from the deck by the descent of a couple of steps--there  were ranged boarding pikes, muskets, cutlasses and pistols, ready for  instant use. In shape they formed stars, hearts and diamonds, dangerous  but fantastic ornaments.    The brightness of these arms, and the handy way in which they were  arranged in the sockets made to receive them, showed at once that they  were designed for use, while the various other fixtures of the cabin and  docks plainly bespoke preparation for conflict. A strong and lofty  boarding-netting being stowed, also, told of the readiness of the \"Sea  Witch\" to repel boarders. That all these preparations had been made  merely as ordinary precautions in a peaceful trade was by no means  probable; and yet there they were, and there stood the bright-eyed,  handsome and youthful commander upon the quarter-deck, but he did not  look the desperado--such a term would have poorly accorded with his  open and manly countenance, hie quiet and gentlemanly mien. A pirate  would hardly have dared to lay the course he steered in these latitudes,  where an English or French cruiser was very likely to cross his track.    \"He handles a ship as prettily as ever a true blue did yet,\" said one of  the forecastle group, in replying to some remark of a comrade concerning  the commander.    \"That's true,\" answered another; \"he seems to have a sort of natural way  with him, as though he'd been born aboard and never seed the land at  all; and as to that matter, there may be them on board who say as much  of him.\"    \"That isn't far from the truth,\" answered Bill Marline, \"seein' he  started so arly on the sea he can't tell when he wasn't there himself.\"    \"How was that matter, Bill?\" asked one of his messmates. \"They say you  have kept the captain's reckoning, man and boy, these fifteen years.\"    \"That have I, and never a truer heart floated than the man you see  yonder leaning over the rail on the quarterdeck, where he belongs,\"  answered Bill Marline.    \"How did you first fall in with him, Bill?--Tell us that,\" said one of  the crew.    \"Well, do ye see, messmates, it must have been the matter of thirteen  years ago, there or thereabouts, but I can't exactly say, seeing's I  never have kept a log and can't write; but must have been about that  length of time, when I was a foremast hand on board the 'Sea Lion,' as  fine an Indiaman as you would wish to see. We were lying in the  Liverpool docks, with sails bent and cargo stowed, under sailing orders,  when one afternoon there strolled alongside a boy rather ragged and  dirty, but with such eyes and such a countenance as would make him a  passport anywhere. Well, do ye see, we were lazing away time on board,  and waiting the captain's coming before we hauled out into the stream,  and so we coaxed the lad aboard. He either didn't know where he came  from or wouldn't tell, and when we proposed to take him to sea with us,  he readily agreed, and sure enough he sailed in the 'Sea Lion.'\"    \"Well, heave ahead, Bill,\" said one of the group, as the narrator  stopped to stove a fresh instalment of the Virginia weed in his larboard  cheek.    \"Heave ahead.\"    \"We hadn't got fairly clear of the channel,\" continued Bill Marline,  \"before the boy had become a general favorite all over the ship. We  washed him up and bent on a new suit of toggery on him, with a reg'lar  tarpaulin, and there was almost a fight whether the forecastle or the  cabin should have him. At last it was left to the boy himself, and he  chose to remain with us in the forecastle. The boy wasn't sick an hour  on the passage until after we left the Cape of Good Hope, when the flag  halliards getting fouled, he was sent up to the peak to loosen it, and  by some lurch of the ship was throw upon deck. Why it didn't kill him  was the wonder of all, but the boy was crazy for near a month from the  blow on his head, which he got in falling, but he gradually got cured  under our captain's care.    \"Well, do ye see, our captain was a regular whole-souled fellow, though  he did sometimes work up a hand's old iron pretty close for him, and so  he took the boy into the cabin and gave him a berth alongside his own,  and as he grew better took to teaching him the use of his instruments,  and mathematics, and the like. The boy they said was wonderful ready,  and learned like a book, and could take the sun and work up the ship's  course as well as the captain; but what was the funniest of all was  that, after he got well, he didn't know one of us, he had forgotten or  even how he came on board the ship, the injury had put such a stopper on  his brain that he had forgotten all that ever occurred before it. To my  mind, howdsomever, it wasn't much to forget, seeing he was little better  than a baby, and hadn't been to sea at all, and you know there aint  anything worth knowing on shore, more'n one can overhaul in a day's  leave, more or less, within hail of the sea.\"    \"That's true,\" growled one or two of his messmates.    \"Our ship was a first class freighter and passage vessel, and on the  home voyage we had plenty of ladies. 'Twas surprisin' to see how natural  like the boy took to 'em, and how they all liked him. He was constantly  learning something, and soon got so he could parley vou like a real  frog-eating Frenchman. And then, as I said before, he took the sun and  worked up the the ship's reckoning like a commodore. Well, do ye se,  messmates, we made a second and third voyage together in that ship, and  when master Will Ratlin--for that was a name we give him when he first  came on board, and he's kept it ever since--was a matter of fourteen  years, he was nearly as big as he is now, and acted as mate, and through  I say it, who ought to know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46751"],[0,"The Strength of the \"Mormon\" Position (#2)"],[1,"conferred  upon them by three other heavenly messengers--the Apostles Peter, James  and John. Thus empowered, the two young men, with four associates,  organized on the sixth of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints. This event took place in Fayette, Seneca County, New  York.    Thus was restored the Ancient Faith, with the powers of the Eternal  Priesthood, the delegated divine authority that enables men to act as  God's representatives, and without which no man can lawfully administer  the sacred ordinances of the Gospel. \"No man taketh this honor unto  himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron\". (Heb. 5:4.) Thus  was re-established the true Church of Christ, and the prophetic Ensign  lifted for the gathering of scattered Israel (Isaiah 11:12); an event  preparatory to the Savior's second coming.    A Catholic Utterance.    Many years ago a learned man, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,  came to Utah and spoke from the stand of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. I  became well acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly.  A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue's end,  he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science, and  philosophy. One day he said to me: \"You Mormons are all ignoramuses.  You don't even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong  that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world,  and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between  Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are  right, we are wrong; and that's all there is to it. The Protestants  haven't a leg to stand on. For if we are wrong, they are wrong with  us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are  right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the  apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there was no need of  Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then  such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism's attitude is  the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the Gospel  from ancient times, or the restoration of the Gospel in latter days.\"    My reply was substantially as follows: \"I agree with you, Doctor,  in nearly all that you have said. But don't deceive yourself with  the notion that we \"Mormons\" are not aware of the strength of our  position. We are better aware of it than anyone else. We have not all  been to college; we cannot all speak the dead languages; we may be  'ignoramuses', as you say; but we know that we are right, and we know  that you are wrong\". I was just as frank with him as he had been with  me.    An Episcopal View.    At a later period I conversed with another man of culture, a bishop of  the Episcopal Church. He affirmed that if Joseph Smith, at the outset  of his career, had become acquainted with the Episcopalians, he would  have been content and would have looked no further for spiritual light.  \"The trouble is\", said the Bishop, \"Joseph encountered the Methodists,  the Baptists, the Presbyterians and others, with their conflicting  creeds and claims. These failing to satisfy him, he sought elsewhere.  Now the Episcopalians have an unbroken succession of authority all down  the centuries, and if Joseph Smith had become informed as to them, he  would never have taken the trouble to organize another church.\"    And these are some of the views that learned men take of \"Mormonism\".  With all their learning, they are not able to come to a knowledge of  the truth. They do not begin to dream of the greatness of God's work,  the grandeur of Christ's cause. They have no idea of the real strength  of its position. They assume that Joseph Smith stumbled upon something  of which he did not know the true value, and that it was sheer luck  which gave to \"Mormonism\" its vantage ground, its recognized strength  of position. Never was there a grosser error. There are concepts as  much higher than these, as the heavens are higher than the earth. The  \"Mormons\" are not the \"ignoramuses\" when it comes to a consideration of  the Gospel's mighty themes.    The Real Reason.    Yet it is not because of human \"smartness\"--not because the followers  of Joseph Smith are brainier than other people, that they have a  greater knowledge of God and are capable of loftier ideals in religion.  It is because they have received, through the gift of the Holy Ghost,  a perceptive power, a spiritual illumination which the world, with all  its culture, does not possess, and without which no man can know God  or comprehend His purposes. It cannot be had from books and schools.  Colleges and universities cannot impart it. It can come only in one  way--God's way, not man's. The Latter-day Saints have it, not because  of any greater natural ability than other men and women possess, but  because they have bowed in obedience to the divine will, thus making  themselves worthy to receive this inestimable boon. All mankind may  have it upon precisely the same conditions.    Another Objection.    The Episcopal Bishop whom I have mentioned remarked to me on another  occasion, that his main objection to \"Mormonism\" was that we \"Mormons\"  were not interested in anything going on outside of our own community.  He declared that we gave no credit to other peoples or to other systems  for the good they were accomplishing. \"For instance\", said he, \"we  retranslate the Scriptures, making them more plain, more intelligible,  with a view to enlightening mankind thereon; but you give us no credit  for that. We uncover ancient cities, buried civilizations, here in  America and elsewhere; we decipher old-time inscriptions on obelisks,  in documents, etc., seeking to acquaint the present with the past; but  you put no value on such work. We found hospitals and infirmaries,  maintain missions, carry the name of Christ to the heathen, publish the  Bible by millions of copies, and are endeavoring to place one in every  home. But you take no account of these things; you are not interested  in our efforts; you think them all vain and of no worth\".    Not a Narrow Religion.    The remark surprised me. I was astonished that any well informed person  could entertain such an opinion respecting us and our religion. There  may be such a thing as a narrow \"Mormon\"; there may be such a thing  as a narrow notion in the mind of some \"Mormon\"; but there never has  been and there never will be such a thing as a narrow \"Mormonism\".  Far from ignoring what other peoples and other systems are doing, it  takes account of everything, and assigns it to its proper place in  the universal scheme. \"If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of  good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\" So says the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in one of its Articles of  Faith.    \"Mormonism\" is a much bigger thing than Catholic scholars or Episcopal  bishops imagine. It is the greatest system of philosophy that the world  has ever known, the grandest poem that Divine Genius ever created, the  mightiest melody ever struck from the vibrant harps of Eternity. It  is the sublime drama of all the ages, and the last act is now on, the  final scene about to unfold.    What \"Mormonism\" Stands For    \"Mormonism\" stands for the restoration of the Gospel in this  dispensation; but that is not all. It stands for the Gospel itself in  all the dispensations, as those periods are termed during which God  has spoken to man and dispensed from heaven these saving principles  and powers. This is but one of a number of such periods, reaching from  the days of Adam down to the present time. The Gospel preached by the  ancient Twelve was a restored Gospel, just as much as it is to-day. It  had been upon Earth before the age of the Apostles. \"Christianity\",  the faith of the once despised \"Christians\", is now \"Mormonism\", the  religion of the unpopular \"Mormons\". What matter the names bestowed  upon it by men? Truth is not to be disposed of by pelting it with  epithets. The character of a jewel is not changed by covering it with  rubbish and dirt. A diamond is a diamond, whether it sparkle in the  dust at your feet, or glitter in the diadem of a queen.    \"Mormonism\" is not a product of the Nineteenth Century. Joseph Smith  did not originate it, nor did any other man. What is called \"Mormonism\"  is the Everlasting Gospel, the religion of all the ages, God's great  plan for the salvation of the human family; and not only their  salvation, but their exaltation if they obey it in fulness. The Gospel  has a three fold power; it redeems, saves, and glorifies. Redemption  is resurrection, but that is not sufficient; it is not enough that  man be brought forth from the grave. All men, good and bad, will be  resurrected; but resurrection is not salvation, any more than salvation  is exaltation. Many redeemed from the grave will be condemned at the  final judgment, for evil deeds done in the body; and many will be  saved, yet come short of the glory that constitutes exaltation.    God's greatest gift, eternal life, has been offered to man again and  again, in a series of dispensations of which this is the greatest and  the last. The \"winding up scene\", the final act of the play--such is  the dispensation now opened, wherein will be brought to a glorious  finale the whole of God's mighty work pertaining to this planet; a  work begun at the very dawn of creation, and continued down to this  day. \"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might gather  together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and  which are on earth; even in Him\". (Eph. 1:10.)    The God Story.    What is generally termed \"The Gospel\" relates to \"the laws and  ordinances of the Gospel\". (See L.D.S. Articles of Faith.) But the  term in its broadest sense means far more. The English word \"Gospel\"  comes from the Anglo-Saxon \"Godspell\" or God-Story. Hence we"]]]
