And so, all in a moment, his troubles blew away, as troubles often do.  Here is a picture of Chopin playing in the home of a prince.                [Illustration 11: CHOPIN PLAYING FOR THE PRINCE]    Do you wonder what kind of a man the little Polish boy became after he  found success in Paris?    One person said about him:    \"Chopin talks little, and rarely about music. But when he does speak of  music one must listen to him.\"    Another said:    \"He is reserved and quiet, especially among strangers, but among his  friends he is witty and full of sly humor.\"    But his thoughts were not for words, they did not weave the pretty  phrases of idle talk. They were busy making nocturnes, waltzes,  mazurkas, impromptus and many other kinds of music that we shall learn  to love as we hear them.    Music was Chopin's true speech. The world soon learned to love what he  said in it. And it always will love it.    See how beautifully he wrote his music.                      [Illustration 12: CHOPIN'S AUTOGRAPH]    There was neither telephone nor telegraph in those days. Yet it did not  take long for another composer, Robert Schumann, who lived far away, in  Germany, to learn that a genius by the name of Chopin lived in Paris.    The post carried to Schumann a copy of Chopin's first printed music.  This was a theme taken from Mozart's Opera _Don Juan_, which Chopin  arranged with variations for the piano.    When Schumann played it to his friends everyone exclaimed: \"How  beautiful it is!\"    Then someone said:    \"Chopin--I never heard the name. Who can he be?\"                         [Illustration 13: R. SCHUMANN]    So we see that his thoughts printed as music flew like winged messengers  to carry news of him to others in distant places. And people not merely  asked: \"Who can he be?\" but they found out who he was, and kept passing  the news on and on until finally it has reached us!    Chopin was never a robust person, though he was well and busy most of  his life. But in the last years he suffered much from illness. This led  him to travel to many places from Paris for the good of his health.    Chopin was devoted to Poland, the beloved land of his birth. Here is a  picture of the great composer who has fallen asleep at the keyboard and  is dreaming of a glorious future for Poland.                  [Illustration 14: CHOPIN DREAMING OF POLAND]    Once he went to England and to Scotland. He played in London and was  highly praised for the beautiful way he performed his own music.    While it is true that Chopin was ill in the last years of his life, we  must notice that he kept right on with his work. He played and composed  just as he always had done. Chopin died in Paris, October 17, 1849, just  two years after Mendelssohn, who died in 1847.    Many men, who would have given up everything had they not been brave,  have worked right on through illness.    Milton was blind, but he dictated _Paradise Lost_ to his daughter.    Beethoven was deaf, but he did not give up composing.    Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote the lovely _Child's Garden of Verses_,  was ill all his life, but he kept on writing. Grieg was probably never  well all his life, but he never gave up.                           [Illustration 15: MILTON]                          [Illustration 16: BEETHOVEN]                          [Illustration 17: STEVENSON]                            [Illustration 18: GRIEG]    Have you ever thought that the beautiful ideas of great men sometimes  outlive famous cities?    What a lot of cities and countries we must visit in our thoughts, to see  the great composers at their work. For example--    1. Grieg belongs to Norway.    2. Chopin to Warsaw and Paris.    3. Schubert to Vienna in Austria.    4. Bach to Thuringia in Saxony, Germany.    5. Handel to Germany and England.    6. Haydn to Hungary.    7. Beethoven to Germany and Vienna. (He was born at Bonn on the Rhine.)    8. Schumann to Germany.    9. Mendelssohn to Hamburg and Berlin, Germany.    10. Mozart to Salzburg and Vienna in Austria.    It will be a pleasant thing for us to see if we can arrange these names  in order, beginning with the oldest, Bach and Handel, and coming down to  the latest. By doing such things, time and time again, they begin to  stick in the memory.

In the list of composers in the instructions on how to use the book, the  \"r with a caron\" in the name Dvorak was replaced with a regular \"r\".    On page 6, a new paragraph was begun at \"Berlioz was the only\".    On page 7, a quotation mark was added after \"a true lover of music.\"    On page 12, in example seven, the period was moved within the closing  parenthesis.    On page 14, the question mark at the end of question 17 (\"Name some of  the kinds of music that Chopin composed?) was changed to a period."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35062"],[0,"The Woodpeckers (#2)"],[1,", or the throat; or else  in stripes or streaks down the sides of the head and neck, as in the  logcock, or pileated woodpecker.    There is no rule about the color markings of the sexes, as in some  families of birds. Usually the female lacks all the bright markings of  the male; sometimes, as in the logcock, she has them but in more  restricted areas; sometimes, as in the flickers, she has all but one of  the male's color patches; and in a few species, as the red-headed and  Lewis's woodpeckers, the two sexes are precisely alike in color. In the  black-breasted woodpecker, sometimes called Williamson's sapsucker, the  male and female are so totally different that they were long described  and named as different birds. It sometimes happens that a young female  will show the color marks of the male, but will retain them only the  first year.    Though the woodpeckers cling to the trunks of trees, they are not  exclusively climbing birds. Some kinds, like the flickers, are quite as  frequently found on the ground, wading in the grass like meadowlarks.  Often we may frighten them from the tangled vines of the frost grape and  the branches of wild cherry trees, or from clumps of poison-ivy, whither  they come to eat the fruit. The red-headed woodpecker is fond of sitting  on fence posts and telegraph poles; and both he and the flicker  frequently alight on the roofs of barns and houses and go pecking and  pattering over the shingles. The sapsuckers and several other kinds will  perch on dead limbs, like a flycatcher, on the watch for insects; the  flickers, and more rarely other kinds, will sit crosswise of a limb  instead of crouching lengthwise of it, as is the custom with  woodpeckers.    All these points you will soon learn. You will become familiar with the  form, the flight, and the calls of the different woodpeckers; you will  learn not only to know them by name, but to understand their characters;  they will become your acquaintances, and later on your friends.    This heavy bird, with straight, chisel bill and sharp-pointed  tail-feathers; with his short legs and wide, flapping wings, his  unmusical but not disagreeable voice, and his heavy, undulating,  business-like flight, is distinctly bourgeois, the type of a bird  devoted to business and enjoying it. No other bird has so much work to  do all the year round, and none performs his task with more energy and  sense. The woodpecker makes no aristocratic pretensions, puts on none of  the coy graces and affectations of the professional singer; even his gay  clothes fit him less jauntily than they would another bird. He is  artisan to the backbone,--a plain, hard-working, useful citizen,  spending his life in hammering holes in anything that appears to need a  hole in it. Yet he is neither morose nor unsocial. There is a vein of  humor in him, a large reserve of mirth and jollity. We see little of it  except in the spring, and then for a time all the laughter in him  bubbles up; he becomes uproarious in his glee, and the melody which he  cannot vent in song he works out in the channels of his trade, filling  the woodland with loud and harmonious rappings. Above all other birds he  is the friend of man, and deserves to have the freedom of the fields.          II    HOW THE WOODPECKER CATCHES A GRUB      Did you ever see a hairy woodpecker strolling about a tree for what he  could pick up?    There is a _whur-r-rp_ of gay black and white wings and the flash of a  scarlet topknot as, with a sharp cry, he dashes past you, strikes the  limb solidly with both feet, and instantly sidles behind it, from which  safe retreat he keeps a sharp black eye fixed upon your motions. If you  make friends with him by keeping quiet, he will presently forgive you  for being there and hop to your side of the limb, pursuing his ordinary  work in the usual way, turning his head from side to side, inspecting  every crevice, and picking up whatever looks appetizing. Any knot or  little seam in the bark is twice scanned; in such places moths and  beetles lay their eggs. Little cocoons are always dainty morsels, and  large cocoons contain a feast. The butterfly-hunter who is hoping to  hatch out some fine cecropia moths knows well that a large proportion of  all the cocoons he discovers will be empty. The hairy woodpecker has  been there before him, and has torn the chrysalis out of its silken  cradle. For this the farmer should thank him heartily, even if the  butterfly-hunter does not, for the cecropia caterpillar is destructive.    But sometimes, on the fair bark of a smooth limb, the woodpecker stops,  listens, taps, and begins to drill. He works with haste and energy,  laying open a deep hole. For what? An apple-tree borer was there cutting  out the life of the tree. The farmer could see no sign of him; neither  could the woodpecker, but he could hear the strong grub down in his  little chamber gnawing to make it longer, or, frightened by the heavy  footsteps on his roof, scrambling out of the way.    [Illustration: Boring larva.]    It is easy to hear the borer at work in the tree. When a pine forest has  been burned and the trees are dead but still standing, there will be  such a crunching and grinding of borers eating the dead wood that it can  be heard on all sides many yards away. Even a single borer can sometimes  be heard distinctly by putting the ear to the tree. Sound travels much  farther through solids than it does through air; notice how much farther  you can hear a railroad train by the click of the rails than by the  noise that comes on the air. Even our dull ears can detect the woodworm,  but we cannot locate him. How, then, is the woodpecker to do what we  cannot do?    Doubtless experience teaches him much, but one observer suggests that  the woodpecker places the grub by the sense of touch. He says he has  seen the red-headed woodpecker drop his wings till they trailed along  the branch, as if to determine where the vibrations in the wood were  strongest, and thus to decide where the grub was boring. But no one else  appears to have noticed that woodpeckers are in the habit of trailing  their wings as they drill for grubs. It would be a capital study for one  to attempt to discover whether the woodpecker locates his grub by  feeling, or whether he does it by hearing alone. Only one should be sure  he is looking for grubs and not for beetles' eggs, nor for ants, nor for  caterpillars. By the energy with which he drills, and the size of the  hole left after he has found his tidbit, one can decide whether he was  working for a borer.    But when the borer has been located, he has yet to be captured. There  are many kinds of borers. Some channel a groove just beneath the bark  and are easily taken; but others tunnel deep into the wood. I measured  such a hole the other day, and found it was more than eight inches long  and larger than a lead-pencil, bored through solid rock-maple wood. The  woodpecker must sink a hole at right angles to this channel and draw the  big grub out through his small, rough-sided hole. You would be  surprised, if you tried to do the same with a pair of nippers the size  of the woodpecker's bill, to find how strong the borer is, how he can  buckle and twist, how he braces himself against the walls of his house.  Were your strength no greater than the woodpecker's, the task would be  much harder. Indeed, a large grub would stand a good chance of getting  away but for one thing, the woodpecker _spears_ him, and thereby saves  many a dinner for himself.    [Illustration: Indian spear.]    Here is a primitive Indian fish-spear, such as the Penobscots used. To  the end of a long pole two wooden jaws are tied loosely enough to spring  apart a little under pressure, and midway between them, firmly driven  into the end of the pole, is a point of iron. When a fish was struck,  the jaws sprung apart under the force of the blow, guiding the iron  through the body of the fish, which was held securely in the hollow  above, that just fitted around his sides, and by the point itself.    [Illustration: Solomon Islander's spear.]    The tool with which the woodpecker fishes for a grub is very much the  same. His mandibles correspond to the two movable jaws. They are  knife-edged, and the lower fits exactly inside the upper, so that they  give a very firm grip. In addition, the upper one is movable. All birds  can move the upper mandible, because it is hinged to the skull. (Watch a  parrot some day, if you do not believe it.) A medium-sized woodpecker,  like the Lewis's, can elevate his upper mandible at least a quarter of  an inch without opening his mouth at all. This enables him to draw his  prey through a smaller hole than would be needed if he must open his  jaws along their whole length. Between the mandibles is the  sharp-pointed tongue, which can be thrust entirely through a grub,  holding him impaled. Unlike the Indian's spear-point, the woodpecker's  tongue is barbed heavily on both sides, and it is extensile. As a tool  it resembles the Solomon Islander's spear. A medium-sized woodpecker can  dart his tongue out two inches or more beyond the tip of his bill. A New  Bedford boy might tell us, and very correctly, that the woodpecker  _harpoons_ his grub, just as a whaleman harpoons a whale. If the grub  tries to back off into his burrow, out darts the long, barbed tongue and  spears him. Then it drags him along the crooked tunnel and into the  narrow shaft picked by the woodpecker, where the strong jaws seize and  hold him firmly.          III    HOW THE WOODPECKER COURTS HIS MATE      Other birds woo their mates with songs, but the woodpecker has no voice  for singing. He cannot pour out his soul in melody and tell his love his  devotion in music. How do songless birds express their emotions? Some by  grotesque actions and oglings, as the horned owl, and some by frantic  dances, as the sharp-tailed grouse, woo and win their mates; but the"]]]
