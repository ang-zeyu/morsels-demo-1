Since this second refraction is attended with much loss  of light it must be evident, that in the immersion system a much greater  quantity of light enters the objective than is possible, other things  being equal, in objectives of the dry system.    If we let _u_ represent one half the angular aperture of an objective,  represented in the diagram by _D'BN_ in the case of the immersion, and  _n_ the index of refraction of the medium interposed between the  cover-glass and the objective we have in the formula _n_ sin. _u_ a  mathematical expression of the optic power of the various systems of  lenses, or in other words for what is designated the numerical aperture.    The following table gives the numerical apertures of objectives of the  various systems and of various angular apertures. In the dry system  _n._, representing the index of refraction of air is taken as 1.00; in  the immersion systems _n_ equals 1.33 for water, 1.52 for cedar oil and  1.66 for monobromnaphthalin. A glance at the table will suffice to show  the great advantage which the immersion objectives have over those of  the dry series.      --------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----    Angular       |10 deg. |20 deg. |30 deg. |40 deg. |50 deg. |60 deg. |70 deg. |80 deg. |90 deg. |100 deg.|110 deg.|120 deg.|130 deg.|140 deg.    aperture 2 _u_|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |      =Numerical apertures.=      --------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----    Dry series    |0,09|0,18|0,26|0,34|0,42|0,50|0,57|0,64|0,71|0,77|0,82|0,87|0,91|0,94    _n_ = 1,00    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    --------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----    Water-        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    Immersion     |0,12|0,24|0,35|0,46|0,56|0,66|0,76|0,85|0,94|1,02|1,09|1,15|1,20|1,25    _n_ = 1,33    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    --------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----    Homogeneous   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    Oil-Immersion |0,14|0,26|0,40|0,52|0,64|0,76|0,87|0,98|1,07|1,16|1,24|1,32|1,38|1,43    _n_ = 1,52    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    --------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----    Monobromide of|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    Naphthaline-  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    Immersion     |0,15|0,29|0,43|0,57|0,70|0,83|0,95|1,07|1,17|1,27|1,36|1,44|1,50|1,56    _n_ = 1,66    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    [Illustration: Photographic objectives with iris diaphragms, f/3.5]      ----------------+----+----+----+----    Focal length mm | 64 | 42 | 35 | 24    ----------------+----+----+----+----    Price $         | 20 | 18 | 18 | 18    ----------------+----+----+----+----            =Objective 1b.=      It is designed principally for drawing extended sections and large  specimens, and consists of two adjustable doublets.

(#2)"],[1,"whole, with the change of the details.    An analogy, given by Max Verworn, carries us a step further. He likens  life to a flame, and takes a gas flame with its butterfly shape as a  particularly appropriate illustration. Here the shape of the flame remains  constant, even in its details. Immediately above the burner, at the base  of the flame, there is a completely dark space; surrounding this, a bluish  zone that is faintly luminous; and beyond this again, the broad spread of  the two wings that are brightly luminous. The flame, like the river,  preserves its identity of form, while its constituent details--the gases  that feed it--are in continual change. But there is not only a change of  material in the flame; there is a change of condition. Everywhere the gas  from the burner is entering into energetic combination with the oxygen of  the air, with evolution of light and heat. There is change in the  constituent particles as well as change of the constituent particles;  there is more than the mere flux of material through the form; there is  change of the material, and in the process of that change energy is  developed.    A steam-engine may afford us a third illustration. Here fresh material is  continually being introduced into the engine there to suffer change. Part  is supplied as fuel to the fire there to maintain the temperature of the  engine; so far the illustration is analogous to that of the gas flame. But  the engine carries us a step further, for part of the material supplied to  it is water, which is converted into steam by the heat of the fire, and  from the expansion of the steam the energy sought from the machine is  derived. Here again we have change in the material with development of  energy; but there is not only work done in the subject, there is work done  by it.    But the living organism differs from artificial machines in that, of  itself and by itself, it is continuously drawing into itself non-living  matter, converting it into an integral part of the organism, and so  endowing it with the qualities of life. And from this non-living matter it  derives fresh energy for the carrying on of the life of the organism.    The engine and the butterfly gas flame do not give us, any more than the  river, a complete picture of the living organism. The form of the river is  imposed upon it from without; the river is defined by its bed, by the  contour of the country through which it flows. The form and size of the  flame are equally defined by exterior conditions; they are imposed upon it  by the shape of the burner and the pressure of the gas passing through it.  The form of the engine is as its designer has made it. But the form of the  living organism is imposed upon it from within; and, as far as we can  tell, is inherent in it. Here is the wonder and mystery of life: the power  of the living organism to assimilate dead matter, to give it life and  bring it into the law and unity of the organism itself. But it cannot do  this indiscriminately; it is not able thus to convert every dead material;  it is restricted, narrowly restricted, in its action. \"One of the chief  characteristics of living matter is found in the continuous range of  chemical reactions which take place between living cells and their  inorganic surroundings. Without cease certain substances are taken up and  disappear in the endless round of chemical reactions in the cell. Other  substances which have been produced by the chemical reactions in living  matter pass out of the cell and reappear in inorganic nature as waste  products of the life process. The whole complex of these chemical  transformations is generally called _Metabolism_. Inorganic matter  contrasts strikingly with living substance. However long a crystal or a  piece of metal is kept in observation, there is no change of the  substance, and the molecules remain the same and in the same number. For  living matter the continuous change of substances is an indispensable  condition of existence. To stop the supply of food material for a certain  time is sufficient to cause a serious lesion of the life process or even  the death of the cell. But the same happens when we hinder the passing out  of the products of chemical transformation from the cell. On the other  hand, we may keep a crystal of lifeless matter in a glass tube carefully  shut up from all exchange of substance with the external world for as many  years as we like. The existence of this crystal will continue without end  and without change of any of its properties. There is no known living  organism which could remain in a dry resting state for an infinitely long  period of time. The longest lived are perhaps the spores of mosses which  can exist in a dry state more than a hundred years. As a rule the seeds of  higher plants show their vital power already weakened after ten years;  most of them do not germinate if kept more than twenty to thirty years.  These experiences lead to the opinion that even dry seeds and spores of  lower plants in their period of rest of vegetation continue the processes  of metabolism to a certain degree. This supposition is confirmed by the  fact that a very slight respiration and production of carbonic acid can be  proved when the seeds contain a small percentage of water. It seems as if  life were weakened in these plant organs to a quite imperceptible degree,  but never, not even temporarily, really suspended.    \"Life is, therefore, quite inseparable from chemical reactions, and on the  whole what we call life is nothing else but a complex of innumerable  chemical reactions in the living substance which we call protoplasm.\"[1]    The essential quality, therefore, of life is continual change, but not  mere change in general. It is that special process of the circulation of  matter which we call metabolism, and this circulation is always connected  with a particular chemical substance--protoplasm.    In this substance five elements are always present and  predominant--carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur. The  compounds which these five elements form with each other are most complex  and varied, and they also admit to combination--but in smaller  proportions--some of the other elements, of which phosphorus, potassium,  calcium, magnesium, and iron are the most important.    For protoplasm--using the term in the most general sense--is a chemical  substance, not a mere mixture of a number of chemical elements, nor a mere  mechanical structure. \"However differently the various plasma substances  behave in detail, they always exhibit the same general composition as the  other albuminoids out of the five 'organo-genetic elements'--namely in  point of weight, 51-54% carbon, 21-23% oxygen, 15-17% nitrogen, 6-7%  hydrogen, and 1-2% sulphur.\"[2]    Haeckel, the writer just quoted, describes the plasm, the universal basis  of all the vital phenomena, in the following terms: \"In every case where  we have with great difficulty succeeded in examining the plasm as far as  possible and separating it from the plasma-products, it has the appearance  of a colourless, viscous substance, the chief physical property of which  is its peculiar thickness and consistency. The physicist distinguishes  three conditions of inorganic matter--solid, fluid, and gaseous. Active  living protoplasm cannot be strictly described as either fluid or solid in  the physical sense. It presents an intermediate stage between the two  which is best described as viscous; it is best compared to a cold jelly,  or solution of glue. Just as we find the latter substance in all stages  between the solid and the fluid, so we find in the case of protoplasm. The  cause of this softness is the quantity of water contained in the living  matter, which generally amounts to a half of its volume and weight. The  water is distributed between the plasma molecules or the ultimate  particles of living matter in much the same way as it is in the crystals  of salts, but with the important difference that it is very variable in  quantity in the plasm. On this depends the capacity for the absorption or  imbibition in the plasm, and the mobility of its molecules, which is very  important for the performance of the vital actions. However, this capacity  of absorption has definite limits in each variety of plasm; living plasm  is not soluble in water, but absolutely resists the penetration of any  water beyond this limit.\"[3] And Czapek further tells us that \"the most  striking feature of cell life is the fact that an enormous number of  chemical reactions take place within the narrowest space. Most plant cells  do not exceed 0.1 to 0.5 millimetres in diameter. Their greatest volume  therefore can only be an eighth of a cubic millimetre. Nevertheless, in  this minute space we notice in every stage of cell life a considerable  number of chemical reactions which are carried on contemporaneously,  without one disturbing the other in the slightest degree.\"[4]    It is clear if organic bodies were built up of chemical compounds of small  complexity and great stability that this continuous range of chemical  reactions, this unceasing metabolism, could not take place. It is  therefore a necessary condition for organic substances that they should be  built up of chemical compounds that are most complex and unstable.  \"Exactly those substances which are most important for life possess a very  high molecular weight, and consequently very large molecules, in  comparison with inorganic matter. For example: egg-albumin is said to have  the molecular weight of at least 15,000, starch more than 30,000, whilst  the molecular weight of hydrogen is 2, of sulphuric acid and of potassium  nitrate about 100, and the molecular weight of the heaviest metal salts  does not exceed about 300.\"[5]    To sum up: the living organism, whether it be a simple cell, or the  ordered community of cells making up the perfect plant or animal, is an  entity,"]]]
