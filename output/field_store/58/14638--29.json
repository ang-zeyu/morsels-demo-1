This is especially true on steep hillsides. Common trees  in the middle layer include _Achras zapote_, _Bombax ellipticum_,  _Cecropia mexicana_, _Orbignya cohune_, and _Sabal_ sp. The lowermost  layer reaches a height of about 10 meters; in many places in the forest  this layer is absent. Common trees in the lower stratum include  _Crysophila argentea_, _Cymbopetalum penduliflorum_, _Casearia_ sp., and  _Hasseltia dioica_.    The ground cover is sparce; apparently only a few small herbs and ferns  live on the heavily shaded forest floor. Important herpetological  habitats include the leaf litter, rotting stumps, and rotting tree  trunks on the forest floor and the buttresses of many of the gigantic  trees, especially _Ceiba pentandra_ (Pl. 2). Epiphytes, especially  various kinds of bromeliads, are common. Most frequently these are in  the trees in the upper and middle strata.    At Toocog there is sharp break between savanna and forest (Pl. 7, fig.  2). The forest is noticeably drier and more open than at Chinaja (Pl.  9). The crowns of the trees are lower, and there is no nearly continuous  canopy between 40 and 50 meters above the ground. Although _Swietenia  macrophylla_ and other large trees occur, they are less common than at  Chinaja. Especially common at Toocog are _Achras zapote_, _Brosimum  alicastrum_, and various species of _Ficus_.          GAZETTEER      The localities from which specimens were obtained are cited below and  shown on the accompanying map (Fig. 1).    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of El Peten, Guatemala, showing localities  mentioned in text.]          Chinaja.--Lat. 16 deg. 02', long. 90 deg. 13', elev. 140 m. Camp of        the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala and formerly a small        settlement. On some maps Chinaja is located just to the north        of the Alta Verapaz--El Peten boundary; recent surveys place        the location just to the south of the imaginary line through        the rainforest. Field work was conducted in the immediate        vicinity of the camp, on the lower slopes of the Serrania de        Chinaja, and at several sites to the northwest and        north-northwest of Chinaja, where the forest was being        cleared. The entire area supports rainforest.          La Libertad.--Lat. 16 deg. 47', long. 90 deg. 07', elev., 170 m. A        town on the savannas in central El Peten; although we        collected there in the rainy season, the specimens obtained on        the savannas are not included in this report.          Paso Subin.--Lat. 16 deg. 38', long. 90 deg. 12', elev. 90 m. A small        settlement on the Rio Subin, a tributary of the Rio de la        Pasion. Specimens were obtained in rainforest in the immediate        vicinity of the settlement.          Rio de la Pasion.--A large river flowing northward through        southern El Peten and thence westward into the Rio Usumacinta.        Specimens were obtained along the river between the Rio Subin        and Sayaxche.          Rio San Roman.--A river flowing northward in south-central El        Peten to the Rio Salinas (Usumacinta). We collected along the        river at a place about 16 kilometers north-northwest of        Chinaja, approximately at Lat. 16 deg. 10', long. 90 deg. 17', elev.        110 m. In the dry season the river was clear; it is surrounded        by rainforest.          Sayaxche.--Lat. 16 deg. 31', long. 90 deg. 09', elev. 80 m. A town on        the southern bank of the Rio de la Pasion. Specimens were        obtained in the rainforest and in cleared areas in the        immediate vicinity of the town.          Toocog (formerly Sojio).--Lat. 16 deg. 41', long. 90 deg. 02', elev.        140 m. A camp of the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala located at        the rainforest-savanna edge, 15 kilometers southeast of La        Libertad. Although we collected on the savannas as well as in        the forest, especially to the east of the camp, only species        obtained in the forest are considered in this report.          THE HERPETOFAUNA OF THE RAINFOREST      In presenting an account of the herpetofauna of southern El Peten three  items need to be considered: (1) The composition of the fauna; (2) the  ecology of the fauna; (3) the relationships of the fauna. Each of these  topics is discussed briefly below. Logically a discussion of the origin  of the fauna should follow, but this is being withheld for inclusion in  a report on the herpetofauna of the entire El Peten by L. C. Stuart and  the author; at that time the above topics will be expanded to cover the  herpetofauna of the whole region.

Another 13 species probably occur in southern El  Peten (see Hypothetical List of Species). The fauna primarily is  composed of typical humid lowland forest inhabitants, such as:      _Hyla ebraccata_    _Hyla loquax_    _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_    _Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta_    _Anolis biporcatus_    _Anolis capito_    _Anolis humilis uniformis_    _Eumeces sumichrasti_    _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_    _Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas_    _Leptophis ahaetulla praestans_    _Xenodon rabdocephalus mexicanus_    _Bothrops nasutus_    _Bothrops schlegeli schlegeli_    Nevertheless, the region also provides at least a limited amount of  habitat suitable for some species that are more frequently found in open  forest of a drier nature; such species include:      _Hyla microcephala martini_    _Hyla staufferi_    _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_    _Anolis sericeus sericeus_    _Eumeces schwartzei_    _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_    Because of the absence of sufficiently open habitat or owing to the  presence of competitors, some conspicuous members of sub-humid forests  are not present in southern El Peten. Conspicuous absentees are the  following:      _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_    _Phrynohyas spilomma_    _Triprion petasatus_    _Anolis tropidonotus_    _Ctenosaura similis_    _Ameiva undulata_    _Cnemidophorus angusticeps_    _Conophis lineatus_    _Masticophis mentovarius mentovarius_    PLATE 7    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Rain pond in forest at Toocog. This was a  breeding site for six species of frogs.]      Ecology of the Herpetofauna    Our two visits to Chinaja and Toocog afforded the opportunity to gather  data on the ecology of the rainforests of southern El Peten and to study  the relationships between the environment and members of the  herpetofauna. Tropical rainforests present the optimum conditions  for life, and it is in this environment that life reaches its greatest  diversity. Here, too, biological inter-relationships are most complex.  This complexity is illustrated by the presence of many species of some  genera, all of which are found together in the same geographic region.  In the rainforests of southern El Peten there are six species of  _Anolis_, five of _Hyla_, four of _Bothrops_, and three of  _Coniophanes_. Obviously, the diversity of ecological niches in the  rainforest is sufficient to support a variety of related species. Of the  examples mentioned above, fairly adequate ecological data were obtained  for most of the species of _Anolis_, which will be used to show the  ecological diversity and vertical stratification of sympatric species in  the rainforests.    Of the six species of _Anolis_, all except _A. sericeus_ are typically  found in humid forests. _Anolis sericeus sericeus_ is poorly represented  in the collections from southern El Peten, where it may be in  competition with _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_ that resembles _Anolis s.  sericeus_ in size, coloration, and habits. Therefore, _Anolis sericeus  sericeus_ is excluded from the following discussion. The common  terrestrial species is _Anolis humilis uniformis_; sometimes this small  species perches or suns on the bases of small trees or buttresses of  some large trees. When disturbed it takes to the ground and seeks cover  in the leaf litter or beneath logs or palm fronds. _Anolis lemurinus  bourgeaei_ is about twice the size of _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and is  usually observed on buttresses of large trees or on the lower two meters  of tree trunks. Individuals were seen foraging on the ground along with  _Anolis humilis uniformis_. At no time were _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_  observed to ascend the trunks of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38404"],[0,"A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in (#2)"],[1,"   Hearne's general Map        MAP OF COPPERMINE RIVER                        _At end_          As surveyed by Sir John Franklin in 1821.

When a young man, only twenty-four years old, he was  sent on foot to explore the interior of a great continent. Though he  knew nothing of mines or minerals, he, like many a man similarly  equipped since his day, was to report on a great mining property.  Naturally his report on the \"mine\" of copper is of little value, but his  account of Northern Canada and of the life of the natives who inhabited  it is the first published detailed description of any portion of the  interior of Western Canada. Very few men of his age accomplished so  much, and fewer still have published such admirable narratives of their  enterprises.    All that we know of Hearne's early life is contained in an obituary  notice which appeared in the _European Magazine and London Review_ for  June 1797, entitled \"Some Account of the late Mr. Samuel Hearne, Author  of 'A Journey from Prince of Wales Fort, in Hudson's Bay, to the  Northern Ocean, undertaken by order of the Hudson's Bay Company for the  discovery of Copper Mines, a North-West Passage, &c., in the years 1769,  1770, 1771, and 1772.'\"        \"Mr. Samuel Hearne was born in the year 1745. He was the son of      Mr. Hearne, Secretary to the Waterworks, London Bridge, a very      sensible man, and of a respectable family in Somersetshire; he      died of fever in his 40th year, and left Mrs. Hearne with this      son, then but three years of age, and a daughter two years      older. Mrs. Hearne, finding her income too small to admit her      living in town as she had been accustomed to, retired to      Bimmester, in Dorsetshire (her native place), where she lived as      a gentlewoman, and was much respected. It was her wish to give      her children as good an education as the place afforded, and      accordingly [she] sent her son to school at a very early period,      but his dislike to reading and writing was so great that he made      very little progress in either. His masters, indeed, spared      neither threats nor persuasion to induce him to learn, but their      arguments were thrown away on one who seemed predetermined never      to become a learned man; he had, however, a very quick      apprehension, and, in his childish sports, showed unusual      activity and ingenuity; he was particularly fond of drawing, and      though he never had the least instruction in the art, copied      with great delicacy and correctness even from nature. Mrs.      Hearne's friends, finding her son had no taste for study,      advised her fixing on some business, and proposed such as they      judged most suitable for him; but he declared himself utterly      averse to trade, and begged he might be sent to sea. His mother      very reluctantly complied with his request, took him to      Portsmouth, and remained with him till he sailed. His captain      (now Lord Hood) promised to take care of him, and he kept his      word; for he gave him every indulgence his youth required. He      was then but eleven years of age. They had a warm engagement      soon after he entered, and took several prizes. The captain told      him he should have his share, but he begged, in a very      affectionate manner, it should be given to his mother, and she      should know best what to do with it. He was a midshipman several      years under the same commander; but, either on the conclusion of      the war, or having no hopes of preferment, he left the navy, and      entered into the service of the Hudson's Bay Company as mate of      one of their sloops. He was, however, soon distinguished from      his associates by his ingenuity, industry, and a wish to      undertake some hazardous enterprise by which mankind might be      benefited. This was represented to the Company, and they      immediately applied to him as a proper person to be sent on an      expedition they had long had in view, viz. to find out the      North-West Passage. He gladly accepted the proposal, and how far      he succeeded is shown to the public in his Journal. On his      return he was advanced to a more lucrative post at Prince of      Wales Fort, on Hudson Bay, and in a few years was made      Commander-in-Chief, in which position he remained till 1782,      when the French unexpectedly landed at Prince of Wales Fort,      took possession of it, and after having given the governor leave      to secure his own property, seized the stock of furs, &c. &c.,      and blew up the fort. At the Company's request Mr. H. went out      the year following, saw it rebuilt,[1] and the new Governor      settled in his habitation (which they took care to fortify a      little better than formerly), and returned to England in 1787.      He had saved a few thousands, the fruits of many years'      industry, and might, had he been blessed with prudence, have      enjoyed many years of ease and plenty; but he had lived so long      where money was of no use that he seemed insensible of its value      here, and lent it with little or no security to those he was      scarcely acquainted with by name. Sincere and undesigning      himself, he was by no means a match for the duplicity of others.      His disposition, as may be judged by his writing, was naturally      humane; what he wanted in learning and polite accomplishments he      made up in native simplicity and innate goodness; and he was so      strictly scrupulous with regard to the property of others that      he was heard to say a few days before his death, 'He could lay      his hand on his heart and say he had never wronged any man of      sixpence.'        \"Such are the outlines of Mr. Hearne's character, who, if he had      some failings, had many virtues to counterbalance them, of which      charity was not the least. He died of the dropsy, November 1792,      aged 47.\"    He seems to have entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company and to  have been sent to Fort Prince of Wales, the great stone fortification on  the low bare rocky point at the mouth of the Churchill River on Hudson  Bay, when he was about twenty years old. For several years he was  engaged in the fur trade with the Eskimos, up and down the coast of  Hudson Bay, north of Churchill River. One little glimpse is caught of  him, on July 1, 1767, for on that day he chiselled his name on the  smooth hard rock of Sloops Cove, on the west side of Churchill harbour.  When I visited the place, in 1894, the name was as fresh and plain as if  his hammer and chisel had just been laid aside.    Being possessed of much more than the average amount of ability and  enthusiasm, he was chosen by Moses Norton, the energetic Governor of  Fort Prince of Wales, to go out with the Indians into the vast, and as  far as that was then known, limitless, territory west of Hudson Bay, in  order to find and prospect the place where the native copper had been  found which the Indians often brought with them to the fort.    During the year preceding his departure on his first expedition, he had  had an excellent opportunity to perfect himself in a knowledge of  astronomical and geodetic work, for in the summer of 1768 the annual  ship had brought William Wales, F.R.S., and Joseph Dymond from London,  commissioned by the Royal Society to remain at Fort Prince of Wales  throughout the ensuing year in order to observe the transit of Venus  over the sun on the 3rd of June 1769.[2] They remained at the fort until  the ship left again for London in August of the following year (1769).  Mr. Wales was one of the foremost astronomers, mathematicians, and  litterateurs of his age. Shortly after his return to England he"]]]
