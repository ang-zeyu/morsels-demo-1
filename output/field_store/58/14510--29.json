Thus then with regard to theories we have hitherto had \"confusion worse  confounded,\" and as with theories so it has been with antidotes. They  were proposed in numbers, but only to be given up again, some intended  to decompose and destroy the subtle poison in the system, others to  counteract its action on the system with that action unknown. It is  scarcely too much to assert that there are but few chemicals and drugs  in the materia medica that have not been tried as antidotes in  experiments on animals and dozens upon dozens that have been tried in  vain on man.    The reasons for this somewhat chaotic state of our science on a subject  of so much interest to mankind are various. The countries of Europe, in  which scientific research is most keenly pursued, have but few  indigenous, and these comparatively harmless snakes. The best scientific  talent has, therefore, only exceptionally been brought to bear on the  subject. In those countries on the other hand in which venomous snakes  abound and opportunities for observing the poison-symptoms on man are  more plentiful, the observing element has been comparatively deficient.    A still more potent source of failure must be sought in the faulty  methods of research pursued by most investigators. Experiments on  animals were far too much resorted to, and their frequently misleading  results accepted as final, whilst observations on man did not receive  the attention their importance demanded.    In the investigation of this subject the first desideratum was no doubt  to find the correct theory of the action of snake poison and to define  the law governing that action, assuming as a working hypothesis that  there is but one law for all snake-poison and not several ones, just as  there is one law for the structure of these reptiles, admitting of  variations, but not of absolute divergence from the general plan. The  shortest and surest way to find this law is close observation and  careful analysis of the symptoms produced by the poison on man, and as  the opportunities for such observation are not of frequent occurrence to  the individual, co-operation and careful comparison of notes on the part  of many observers.    This method of investigation, which, during the last few years, has been  pursued in Australia with most satisfactory results, was never practised  anywhere else, not even in America, but instead of it each observer,  with few exceptions, kept his own notes to himself, and if there  happened to be one here and there hungry for more knowledge than his  scanty opportunities for observation on man would supply, his resort  was usually experiments on animals. A few snakes were caught, a few  luckless dogs or other animals procured, and the slaughter of the  innocents began.    As test experiments to confirm observations on man, or made with a view  of finding a correct theory of the action of snake-poison, these  attempts were unobjectionable, although, without an elaborate scientific  apparatus and in other than skilled hands, they were not likely to  produce results of any value. But most of the experimenters were not  content with purely theoretical aims. They were seeking to find the  antidote by a purely empirical method, and had nothing to guide them in  the choice of drugs. A dose of snake-poison was administered to an  animal, and then a dose of some drug or chemical, chosen _ad libitum_,  sent after it. Next day another presumed antidote was tried, another  animal slaughtered, and so on _ad nauseam_, until finally the baffled  antidote-searcher, not one whit the wiser for all his trouble and the  useless tortures inflicted, confessed himself beaten and joined in the  \"_non possums_\" of his predecessors.    One important point has been completely left out of sight and ignored in  all this experimenting on animals. It is the fact that the action of  snake-poison on the human system and on that of animals, more especially  dogs, though very similar, is not absolutely identical, and that for  this reason alone results of experiments on the latter cannot be  indiscriminately applied to man. As pointed out before, analogy has  been confounded with identity. When a dog, for instance, has been bitten  by a snake he does not usually collapse as quickly as a human being, but  is able to drag himself about much longer before his hind legs refuse  their service and he is unable to walk. This longer duration of the  first stage of the poisoning process is no doubt owing to a higher  organisation and greater functional power of the motor nerve centres of  dogs. The amount of motor force at their disposal is greater, and hence  they offer greater resistance to the invader seeking to turn off this  force. When finally the latter gains the ascendency, irregular  discharges of motor nerve force still take place and find their  expression in convulsions, which in man only exceptionally occur. But  the difference between man and dog becomes more marked yet when  strychnine is administered to a dog suffering from snake-poison. It  counteracts the latter quite as effectually in a dog as in man, but has  to be injected with extreme caution, for whilst in man a slight excess  in the quantity required to subdue the snake-virus is not only harmless,  but actually necessary, any excess of it in a dog will at once produce  violent tetanic convulsions and cause the animal to die even quicker  than the snake-poison would have killed it, if allowed to run its  course. In the face of these facts the judiciousness of the proposal  lately made both here and in India to subject the strychnine treatment  of snakebite once more to a series of test experiments on animals  appears more than questionable.    Another cause that has largely contributed to render experiments on  animals so barren of results must be sought in the injudicious selection  of substances intended to serve as antidotes. It is simply impossible to  act on an organic compound like snake-poison, coursing through a living  system, by chemicals that will either combine with it or decompose it in  a manner likely to deprive it of its deadly qualities and render it  innocuous. Yet what do we find? Acids and alkalis, arsenic, bromides and  iodides, chlorine, mercurial preparations, &c., &c., have been poured  into the luckless animals as if they were so many test tubes. A chemical  antidote, a substance possessing special affinity to snake-poison and by  means of this affinity combining with it in some mysterious and  incomprehensible manner, one can hardy imagine to exist. Physiological  antidotes, on the other hand, substances acting on the system in a  manner the exact reverse of, and in direct antagonism to the  snake-poison, though apparently the only feasible ones, have been  strangely neglected and almost despised by experimenters.    In the vast storehouse of Nature the department most likely to furnish  such antidotes is the vegetable kingdom. The untutored human mind has  for centuries past intuitively clung to this idea, and sought among  plants for remedies against the deadly ophidian poison. Hence the great  number of vegetable antidotes that have from time to time been  recommended and the efficacy of some of which at least has been  confirmed by reliable observations. But the hint thus given to science  was not taken. Instead of research being pushed on diligently in the  only direction that promised any chance of success, it was cut short by  the baneful method of experimenting on animals. When it had been  demonstrated that a dog, a cat, or other animal, after having been  saturated with snake-poison, did not recover after the administration of  an alleged antidote, the illogical conclusion was drawn at once that it  could not possibly be of any use to man, whilst, in reality, the only  proof rendered by the experiment, if made properly, was that the  respective antidote could not be relied on in treating animals of the  class experimented on. That some of these despised antidotes are worth a  little further investigation may, in the light of present experience as  to the value of strychnine in snakebite, be inferred from the fact, that  among them is the wood of _Strychnos Colubrina_, and also the well-known  _Huang Noo_, a vegetable extract made from another variety of the  Strychnos family, and largely used by the Chinese, whilst, according to  a letter in the _Australasian Medical Gazette_, July, 1892, the  principal ingredient of a strange compound used by the native snake  doctors of Central America with much success is _Nux Vomica_.    It is superfluous to enter into a criticism of the treatment of  snakebite until recently in vogue, for, with the exception of the local  one by ligature and excision, it stands self-condemned by its complete  inefficiency. It may be summed up as a vain attempt to stem the  collapse invariably attending snakebite by the administration of  stimulants, such as alcohol, ether, ammonia, &c. The attempt is vain,  for a person in collapse from snakebite cannot be stimulated by any of  these remedies, since neither the heart nor the nerve centres respond to  them in the slightest degree, as they do in the absence of snake-poison,  the only one that has any effect at all in slight cases being ammonia.  But the attempt is not only in vain, it is highly injurious, especially  if made with the usual large doses of alcohol, for, in addition to the  latter not having the slightest influence on the snake-poison and its  baneful effects, they act as an anaesthetic and thus add to the existing  depression, besides increasing the tendency to internal haemorrhage.    It might, under these circumstances, have been expected that any new  method of treating snakebite, based on scientific grounds and holding  out a sure prospect of success, would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#2)"],[1," perhaps another  stream? another river flowing into that lake? Encountering difficulties  he would become more and more uneasy as to that point, until at last he  would have detached a scout to make sure.    But mark this further: The party's informants had told Hubbard that he  would find the river easily navigable for eighteen miles. As a matter of  fact the expedition ran into shallows and rapids _within a half mile of  the lake_.    [Sidenote: What Should Have Been Done]    To a woodsman the answer would have stood out as plain as print. He  would have retraced his way, explored farther, found the right river,  and continued. But poor Hubbard was in a hurry, and moreover possessed  that optimistic temperament that so endeared him to all who knew him.  \"They must have made a mistake in the distance. I guess this is all  right,\" said he, and pushed on against difficulties that eventually  killed him.    To a man accustomed to exploration such a mistake is inconceivable.  Labrador is not more dangerous than other wooded northern countries; not  so dangerous as the big mountains; much safer than the desert. A wrong  turn in any of these wildernesses may mean death. Forty men succumbed to  the desert last summer. Do not make that wrong turn. Be sure. Take  _nothing_ for granted--either that \"they made a mistake in the  distance,\" or that \"it's probably all right.\" One of the greatest of  American wilderness travelers knew this--as all wilderness travelers  must--and phrased it in an epigram that has become classic. \"Be sure you  are right, and then go ahead,\" advised Daniel Boone.    [Sidenote: Alertness]    So you do not get lost--barring accidents--you are safe enough. But to  travel well you must add to your minor affairs the same quality,  slightly diluted, perhaps, that I have endeavored to describe above. In  this application it becomes thoroughness and smartness. A great many  people object while camping to keeping things in trim, to getting up in  the morning, to moving with expedition and precision. \"Oh, what's the  use in being so particular!\" they grumble, \"this is supposed to be a  pleasure trip.\"    [Sidenote: Discipline]    Outside the fact that a certain amount of discipline brings efficiency,  there is no doubt that a slack camp means trouble sooner or later. Where  things are not picked up, something important will sooner or later be  lost or left behind. Where the beginning of the day's journey hangs  fire, sooner or later night will catch you in a very bad place indeed.  Where men get in the habit of slouching, physically and mentally, they  become in emergencies unable to summon presence of mind, and incapable  of swift, effective movements. The _morale_ is low; and exclusive of the  fact that such things are an annoyance to the spirit, they may in some  exceptional occasion give rise to serious trouble. Algernon is ten  minutes slow in packing his horse; and Algernon gets well cursed. He is  hurt as to the soul, and demands of himself aggrievedly how ten minutes  can be valued so high. It is not the ten minutes as a space of time, but  as a measure of incompetence. This pack train is ten minutes short of  what a pack train should be; and if the leader's mind is properly  constructed, he is proportionately annoyed.    Although not strictly germane to a discussion of equipments, I am  tempted to hold up a horrible example.    [Sidenote: A Horrible Example]    One evening we were all sitting around a big after-dinner fire at the  Forest Supervisor's summer camp in the mountains, when an outfit drifted  in and made camp a few hundred yards down stream. After an interval the  leader of the party came over and introduced himself.    [Sidenote: A Horrible Example]    He proved to be a youngish man, with curly hair, regular features, a  good physique, and eyes handsome, but set too close together. A blue  flannel shirt whose top button was unfastened, rolled back to show his  neck; a handkerchief was knotted below that; in all his external  appearance he leaned toward the foppish-picturesque. This was in itself  harmless enough. Shortly he began to tell us things. He confided that  his chief ambition was to rope a bear; he related adventures in the more  southern mountains; he stated that he intended to travel up through the  Minarets and over Agnew's Pass, and by way of Tuolumne. This was to  consume two weeks! Finally he became more personal. He told us how  President Roosevelt when on his Pacific Coast tour had spoken to him  personally.    \"When the train started,\" said he, \"I ran after it as hard as I could  with a lot of others, but I ran a lot faster and got ahead, so the  President spoke directly to me--not to the crowd, but to _me_!\"    He left us suitably impressed. Next morning his camp was astir at five  o'clock--as was proper considering the strenuous programme he had  outlined. About seven our friend came over to get his animals, which he  had turned out in the Supervisor's pasture over night--ten animals in  another man's mountain pasture! We had a shooting match, and talked  Reserve matters for just one hour and twenty minutes. Then somebody  waked up.    \"I wonder what's become of Jones; let's go see.\"    We went. Jones was standing dusty in the middle of the corral. In his  hand he held a short loop not over three feet across. This he whirled  forward and _overhand_. Occasionally he would cast it at a horse. Of  course the outraged and astounded animal was stricken about the knees,  whereupon he circulated the confines of the corral at speed.    [Sidenote: Jones and the Mule]    And the animals! At the moment of our arrival Jones was bestowing  attention on a dignified and gaunt mule some seventeen hands high. I  never saw such a giraffe. Two about the size of jackasses hovered near.  One horse's lower lip wabbled abjectly below a Roman nose.    We watched a few moments; then offered mildly to \"help.\" Jones, somewhat  heated and cross, accepted. The first horse I roped I noticed was  barefoot. So were the others. And the route was over a rough granite and  snow country. Thus we formed a procession, each leading some sort of  equine freak. It was by now nearly nine o'clock.    Camp we found about half picked up. The other members of the party were  nice, well-meaning people, but absolutely inexperienced in the ways of  the wilderness. They had innocently intrusted themselves to Jones on the  strength of his self-made reputation; and now undoubtedly were taking  all this fuss and discomfit quite as part of \"roughing it.\"    [Sidenote: Helping the Tenderfeet]    When we saw them we were stricken with pity and a kindly feeling which  Jones had failed to arouse, so we turned in to help them saddle up.    Jones was occupied with a small mule which he claimed was \"bad.\" He  hitched said mule to a tree, then proceeded to elevate one hind leg by  means of a rope thrown over a limb. Why he did not simply blindfold the  animal no one could tell. We looked forward with some joy to the  throwing of the pack-hitches.    [Illustration: On the Trail]    [Sidenote: A Forest Fire]    But at this moment a Ranger dashed up with news of a forest fire over in  the Rock Creek country. The Rangers present immediately scattered for  their saddle horses, while I took a pack and went in search of supplies.    Shortly after one o'clock I was organized, and departed on the trail of  the Rangers. They had struck over the ridge, and down the other side of  the mountains. Their tracks were easy to follow, and once atop the  divide I could see the flames and smoke of the fire over the next  mountain system. Desiring to arrive before dark, I pushed ahead as  rapidly as possible. About half way down the mountain I made out dust  ahead.    \"A messenger coming back for something,\" thought I.    In ten minutes I was stricken dumb to overtake the Jones party plodding  trustingly along in the tracks made by the Rangers.    \"Well,\" I greeted them, \"what are you doing over here? A little off your  beat, aren't you?\"    The members of the party glanced at each other, while Jones turned a  dull red.    \"Wrong trail, eh?\" said he easily; \"where does this one go to?\"    [Sidenote: Jones and the Trail]    \"Why, this isn't a trail!\" I cried. \"Can't you see it's just fresh  tracks made since morning? This will take you to the fire, and that's  about all. Your trail is miles to the north of here.\"    For the moment he was crushed. It was now too late to think of going  back; a short cut was impossible on account of the nature of the  country. Finally I gave him a direction which would cut another  trail--not where he had intended to go, but at least leading to horse  feed. Then I bade him farewell, and rode on to the fire.    [Sidenote: We Put Them Right]    Long after dark, when hunting for the place the boys had camped, I met  that deluded outfit moving supperless, homeless, lost, like ghosts in  the glow of the fire line. Jones was cross and snapped at me when I  asked him if he wasn't seeing a good deal of country. But I looked at  the tired faces of the other members of the party, and my heart  relented, and I headed them for a meadow.    \"How far beyond is Squaw Dome?\" asked Jones as he started.    \"Sixteen miles--about,\" said I.    \"About eight hours the way you and I travel, then,\" said he.    \"About eight weeks the way you travel,\" amended a Ranger standing near.    Two days later a shakemaker came to help us fight fire.    \"Oh, yes, they passed my place,\" said he. \"I went out and tried to tell  him he was off'n the trail, but he waved me aside. 'We have our maps,'  says he, very lofty.\"    Twelve days subsequently I rode a day and a half to Jackass Meadow. They  told us the Jones party just passed! I wonder what became of them, and  how soon their barefooted horses got tender.    Now the tenderfoot one helps out, nor makes fun of, for he is merely  inexperienced and will learn. But this man is in the mountains every  "]]]
