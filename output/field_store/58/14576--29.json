Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear:         *       *       *       *       *      Death hath no power yet upon thy beauty--    Thou art not conquered; beauty's ensign yet    Is crimson on thy lips, and in thy cheeks.--SHAKSPEARE.      It maybe set down, we suppose, as a matter sufficiently settled to become  a principle, that men are moved by nothing more generally and certainly  than by the power of Beauty--particularly Beauty in Woman. That it has an  influence upon _all_ of one sex, like that which Master Shakspeare has  given picture of in the lines we have set upon our front, we would not  pretend to say: but that the wild bard was no freshman in his knowledge of  humanity so far as heart and mind matters were concerned, we feel safe to  assert--and feel confident that the passionate language of Romeo  trespasses no bounds, and is but a faithful declaration of a power that  rules with a milder or a mightier sway in the bosoms of all who answer to  the distinctive name of Man.    This may seem a wide assertion. But it is no less true. The reason of the  slow belief in this universality is, that men are not always subject to  the influence, while the principle of it is always a tenant within them.  There is a time--and with the time comes the development. The mind, as it  unfolds, becomes acquainted with nothing so calculated to excite its  wonder, as its own properties and capabilities--its new perceptions--its  new affections. Till progress brings with it this knowledge of ourselves,  we remain ignorant of half that is within us to affect us like a spell,  and within whose reach we have been unconsciously passing onward and  upward, by a Providential ordering, from our childhood at least, if not  from our cradles.    Keeping this in view, let us consider for a moment something of the  elements of Beauty, and their influence, as a principle, upon the  principles of our nature.--And first it must be admitted that they are  good--of a good origin--and tend to a good result. They are good elements,  we believe, for we find them almost ever associated with what is pleasing,  improving, and satisfactory to us. Indeed, in this connexion, we find them  a source of consolation and delight, where all else has failed to minister  or even suggest them. They are of a good origin--for, if they were not, no  such effect would be wrought upon a system so sadly prone to evil and  villanous principles, and so little open to pure, and elevating, and  comforting ones, that they may be said to come about it, most  emphatically, like \"angel-visits.\" They are elements, again, that tend to  a good result, in their operation, for their consequences are almost ever,  to make men better satisfied with their condition--where they come in, as  an influence upon it, at all--better satisfied with almost everything  about them, so long as they are conscious they are creatures of  proportions and proprieties, and affected intrinsically by them.    If what we here set down respecting the _elements_ of Beauty be true, it  is certainly of an interesting importance in view of the influence of that  quality upon the principles of our nature. We call it _quality_. Perhaps  this is not name enough for something so peculiar and powerful in its  connexion with the _total_ of our spirits. We will term it such, however,  for want of a wider language--and leave men to _feel_ out such definition  as they may deem more good and grateful.    Implanted, then, so deeply as Beauty is in the human heart--so universal,  that millions bow to it as something to fear while they worship--so  certain, as a principle, that scarcely a human being can be said to walk  without the sphere of its influence--it would be needless as well as  unphilosophical to deny that the great object of its fixture--its  enthronement upon its high place, should be one of no common character, or  of a tendency and effect within us, which it would be wrong and  inexcusable to overlook.    What then is the design of this singular and mysterious power, in  connexion with this sad and unaccountable nature--so often the theme of  eulogy and lament--of lofty, long, and desperate satire, among men? The  best answer, we think, is rendered in the influence, where operation is  open to every one who thinks, observes, reasons, acts, among his  fellows.--To enter into particular definitions here, would be needless as  well as wearisome. The general effect upon man, as a sentient and moral  being, must be the point to which our simple remarks and reasons must be  confined.    We have somewhere seen it observed--and have little doubt in the publicity  and good sense of the thought--that there was perhaps no one thing which  tended so materially to awaken lofty and good sentiments among the  people--to qualify the rough outline of character--and soften and  harmonize the untaught elements of their nature, as the frequent,  unrestrained, and encouraged contemplation of the perfect statuary, which  their master sculptors were continually erecting in their temples. This  freedom was a perpetual lesson to a nation. The principle was developed,  and the power of Beauty had a new, and forming, and mastering sway. A  people were coming into the light of better feeling--better  society--better government, under the gradual but no less certain  operation of a living principle, brought into great and beautiful action,  under the commanding hand of Genius, that seemed to pass at once from the  sky, whose perfect things it presented to the sons of earth!--It is not  singular, we think, that such a leading forth of Beauty to the  contemplation of awakened man, should produce effects like those to which  we have adverted. It strikes us that it would have been strange had this  consequence not been generated, and noble sculpture thus have stood before  a world as cold as the marble from which it was stricken. We believe that  Beauty saw a renovating power in the wonder of the Venus--and it would be  a sad thing to feel that it had ever ceased in its progress where woman or  the chisel were doing such things to advance it. Nor has it ceased.  History presents too many instances of the monarch power of Beauty in  woman, to permit us to doubt upon this subject. It has passed upon the  spirit of Man like a thing of necromance--winning him to its command, and  bowing him to its will, until royalty itself has stood powerless in its  presence, and the poor mass of mortals, stricken and panting like cornered  deer before the inexorable hunter. It has been the salvation and ruin of  nations, as well as families and individuals--for queens have obeyed its  supremacy as well as maidens, and kings squared their mandates, and  regulated their course, by the \"line of beauty.\" All this is matter of  record. Sacred and profane story abounds with instances which admit of no  denial, while they excite our wonder. But the wonder ceases,  notwithstanding, when we turn from record to our own experience, and _see_  the effect, on others and ourselves, of what we once _read_ about in the  curious annals of our species. We now see the finished sculpture that  delighted and softened the people of an age, gazed on and admired by every  being whom we are accustomed to regard as rational. No one pretends to  question, much less to deny the beauty of the lovely statue, in which the  perfection of woman is portrayed in the finished feature or the swelling  form. Insensibility here would properly be regarded as a thing to be  ashamed of--as little better than a moral paralysis, which might well  exclude the questionable man from the circle of reasonable, enlightened,  and rising people, as a sad fellow, and a poor pilgrim on the earth. You  will rarely find the roughest nature with a cuticle that will not confess  some sensibility in a presence such as this--and I think we may set it  down as a thing well ascertained, that the picture or chiselling of a  beautiful woman will command the tribute of delight--the  acknowledgment--and loud one too--of a whole and hearty worship from the  tar, as well as the amateur. The galleries of our artists, in which the  principle of Beauty is made to speak and command, sufficiently prove that  there is no passing away of this power which has moved, ruled, and  regulated, to a degree almost incredible, the world of Man, from the time  he came to this school, and this trial of the passions and affections. Let  the question be asked of any one, whose spirit is in healthful action, if  his experience before the work of art, imbodying the Beauty we speak of,  is not of a humanizing--and we will add civilizing, as well as elevating  character, and we are willing to abide the issue of his answer, in full  support of the position we have taken. Such is our belief on the  universality of this influence or element.

Recordings of the breeding calls were made with a Magnemite Portable  Tape-recorder; audiospectrographs were made on a vibralyzer (Kay  Electric Company) using normal pattern and wide bandwidth.          ANALYSIS OF DATA      Data that are used to arrive at a systematic arrangement of the  species of _Ptychohyla_ are analyzed and discussed below for the  values inherent in the analysis. These data are of some value also  in the recognition of species and subspecies but if employed for that  purpose the data must be used in combination with the keys and the  diagnoses of the individual species and subspecies.      External Morphology    Each of the external morphological characters used in the systematic  treatment of _Ptychohyla_, as well as the nature of the tongue,  is discussed below.    SIZE AND PROPORTIONS.--Comparisons of size and certain proportions are  given in Table 1. Frogs of this genus are small; the largest specimen  examined is a female of _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ having a  snout-vent length of 53.3 mm. The species comprising the _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ group are smaller; the largest specimen examined is a  female of _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ having a snout-vent length of  38.0 mm. An analysis of the various measurements and proportions shows  few constant differences. _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ differs from all of  the other species in having the head slightly wider than long and the  tympanum noticeably less than half the size of eye. _Ptychohyla  spinipollex_ has a relatively narrow interorbital distance,  approximately equal to the width of the eyelid, whereas in all of the  other species that distance is much more than the width of the eyelid.    SNOUT.--All species have a blunt snout. In _P. leonhardschultzei_ and  _P. ignicolor_ the snout is nearly square in lateral profile; in _P.  schmidtorum_ the snout is slightly rounded above and below, and in the  other species it is rounded above. _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ and  _P. spinipollex_ have a vertical fleshy rostral keel on the snout; in  these species, because of this keel, the snout in dorsal profile is  pointed. The nostrils are slightly protuberant in all species, and in  _P. schmidtorum_ the internarial region is slightly depressed.    HAND.--The species in the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group have a  vestige of web between the first and second fingers; the other fingers  are about one-third webbed. Breeding males have a cluster of horny  nuptial spines on the thumb. The spines are largest in _P. spinipollex_  (Fig. 1) and vary in number from 35 to 66 (average 47.4) on each thumb.  In the other species of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group the spines  are smaller and usually more numerous; the numbers of spines on each  thumb (means in parentheses) in members of this group are: _P.  euthysanota euthysanota_, 44-143 (83.8); _P. euthysanota  macrotympanum_, 40-110 (63.0); _P. leonhardschultzei_, 24-80 (54.7).  The species in the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group have no web between  the first and second fingers and only a vestige of web between the  other fingers. Furthermore, these species lack nuptial spines in  breeding males. Like the usual horny excrescences on the thumbs of  many species of frogs, the horny spines on the thumbs of members of  the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group are seasonal in development.

Palmar views of right hands of          (A) _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ (KU 58054) and          (B) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 58043).]      Many workers have used the presence of a bifid subarticular tubercle  beneath the fourth finger as a diagnostic character of certain species  of hylids. Examination of the subarticular tubercles in _Ptychohyla_  reveals considerable intraspecific variation. Bifid tubercles beneath  the fourth finger are found in all species except _P. ignicolor_,  which is known from only two specimens. In _P. euthysanota  euthysanota_ nearly 60 per cent and in _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_  about 90 per cent of the specimens have a bifid tubercle beneath the  fourth finger on one or both hands. All specimens of _P.  leonhardschultzei_ have either a bifid or double tubercle beneath the  fourth finger, and some have a bifid distal tubercle beneath the third  finger.    FEET.--Members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group have a weak  tarsal fold, whereas in the species comprising the _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ group the tarsal fold is absent. Webbing on the foot  extends to the discs of the third and fifth toes and to the base of  the penultimate phalanx of the fourth toe, except in _P. ignicolor_,  which has less webbing.    VENTROLATERAL GLANDS.--Breeding males develop thickened, pigmented  glandular areas on the sides of the body. In living specimens of _P.  schmidtorum_ and _P. ignicolor_ the glands are not readily visible,  but in preservative they show as distinctive orange-colored areas.  These glands are most distinct in _P. euthysanota_; in many specimens  of this species the glands are elevated above the surrounding skin.  The extent of the glands is variable (Fig. 2); probably this  variability is due to different degrees of development in individual  frogs rather than to interspecific differences. All _Ptychohyla  ignicolor_ and some _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ have a small, round  glandular area on the chin; to my knowledge this does not occur in the  other species. Superficial examination of microscopic preparations of  the glands reveals no histological differences between species. The  glands occupy most of the thickened area and have narrow ducts leading  to the exterior. Detailed studies of the histology will be reported  elsewhere. Since the glands are developed only in breeding males, it  is surmised that the glands are associated with some phase of the  breeding activity.        [Illustration: FIG. 2. Normal extent of ventrolateral glands in          (A) _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ (KU 58008),          (B) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 58037), and          (C) _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ (UMMZ 119603).]      TONGUE.--The shape of the tongue varies intraspecifically. Usually the  tongue is ovoid; in some specimens it is barely notched posteriorly,  whereas in others it is deeply notched, making the tongue cordiform.  Deeply notched cordiform tongues are found in _P. leonhardschultzei_  and _P. schmidtorum_; with the exception of these two species, some  individuals of all species have emarginate tongues. Some individuals  of all species have tongues that are shallowly notched posteriorly.        Color and Pattern    The dorsum in living frogs of the genus"]]]
