[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#2)"],[1," life with the gallants of the time.  The real quality of this  comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are  conceived.  Ben Jonson had theories about poetry and the drama, and  he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with  them in his plays.  This makes Jonson, like Dryden in his time, and  Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with; particularly when  we remember that many of Jonson's notions came for a time  definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English  poetry.  First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed  in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent  ungoverned and irresponsible Renaissance spirit.  Jonson believed  that there was a professional way of doing things which might be  reached by a study of the best examples, and he found these  examples for the most part among the ancients.  To confine our  attention to the drama, Jonson objected to the amateurishness and  haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and set himself to do  something different; and the first and most striking thing that he  evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours.    As Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote  his own words as to \"humour.\"  A humour, according to Jonson, was a  bias of disposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which         \"Some one peculiar quality       Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw       All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,       In their confluctions, all to run one way.\"    But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:         \"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,       The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,       A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot       On his French garters, should affect a humour!       O, it is more than most ridiculous.\"    Jonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage  personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable  simplification of actual life be it observed in passing); and,  placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict  and contrast, struck the spark of comedy. Downright, as his name  indicates, is \"a plain squire\"; Bobadill's humour is that of the  braggart who is incidentally, and with delightfully comic effect, a  coward; Brainworm's humour is the finding out of things to the end  of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled in the end himself.  But it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the success of  \"Every Man in His Humour.\"  The play is admirably written and each  character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on  observation of the men of the London of the day.  Jonson was  neither in this, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that  he wrote), a supine classicist, urging that English drama return to  a slavish adherence to classical conditions.  He says as to the  laws of the old comedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the  unities of time and place and the use of chorus): \"I see not then,  but we should enjoy the same licence, or free power to illustrate  and heighten our invention as they [the ancients] did; and not be  tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few,  who are nothing but form, would thrust upon us.\"  \"Every Man in His  Humour\" is written in prose, a novel practice which Jonson had of  his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly.  Even the word \"humour\" seems  to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman before  Jonson's use of it.  Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only a  heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,  viewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent  species of comedy in the language.  None the less, Jonson's comedy  merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in  which comedy long continued to run.  To mention only Shakespeare's  Falstaff and his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the  rest, whether in \"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\"  all are conceived in the spirit of humours.  So are the captains,  Welsh, Scotch, and Irish of \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially  later; though Shakespeare never employed the method of humours for  an important personage.  It was not Jonson's fault that many of his  successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated, that is,  degrade the humour: into an oddity of speech, an eccentricity of  manner, of dress, or cut of beard.  There was an anonymous play  called \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\"  Chapman wrote \"A Humourous  Day's Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later, \"The  Humourous Lieutenant,\" and Jonson, besides \"Every Man Out of His  Humour,\" returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies  in \"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled.\"    With the performance of \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" in 1599, by  Shakespeare's company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in  Jonson's career.  Despite his many real virtues, if there is one  feature more than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his  arrogance; and to this may be added his self-righteousness,  especially under criticism or satire.  \"Every Man Out of His  Humour\" is the first of three \"comical satires\" which Jonson  contributed to what Dekker called the poetomachia or war of the  theatres as recent critics have named it.  This play as a fabric of  plot is a very slight affair; but as a satirical picture of the  manners of the time, proceeding by means of vivid caricature,  couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that  righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true  satire -- as a realisation, in short, of the classical ideal of  comedy -- there had been nothing like Jonson's comedy since the  days of Aristophanes.  \"Every Man in His Humour,\" like the two  plays that follow it, contains two kinds of attack, the critical or  generally satiric, levelled at abuses and corruptions in the  abstract; and the personal, in which specific application is made  of all this in the lampooning of poets and others, Jonson's  contemporaries.  The method of personal attack by actual caricature  of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama.  Aristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and  Socrates in \"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in  English drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again.  What Jonson really did, was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an  art, and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a  dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency.  With the  arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in  scorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no wonder that Jonson  soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with  his fellow-authors.  The circumstances of the origin of this  'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have written on the  topic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer.  The  origin of the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references,  apparently to Jonson, contained in \"The Scourge of Villainy,\" a  satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by John  Marston, a fellow playwright, subsequent friend and collaborator of  Jonson's.  On the other hand, epigrams of Jonson have been  discovered (49, 68, and 100) variously charging \"playwright\"  (reasonably identified with Marston) with scurrility, cowardice,  and plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams cannot be  ascertained with certainty.  Jonson's own statement of the matter  to Drummond runs: \"He had many quarrels with Marston, beat him,  and took his pistol from him, wrote his \"Poetaster\" on him; the  beginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on the  stage.\"*    [footnote] *The best account of this whole subject is to be found  in the edition of \"Poetaster\" and \"Satiromastrix\" by J. H. Penniman  in \"Belles Lettres Series\" shortly to appear.  See also his earlier  work, \"The War of the Theatres,\" 1892, and the excellent  contributions to the subject by H. C. Hart in \"Notes and Queries,\"  and in his edition of Jonson, 1906.    Here at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the  quarrel are known.  \"Histriomastix,\" a play revised by Marston in  1598, has been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus  \"represented on the stage\"; although the personage in question,  Chrisogonus, a poet, satirist, and translator, poor but proud, and  contemptuous of the common herd, seems rather a complimentary  portrait of Jonson than a caricature.  As to the personages  actually ridiculed in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" Carlo Buffone  was formerly thought certainly to be Marston, as he was described  as \"a public, scurrilous, and profane jester,\" and elsewhere as the  grand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of the time  (Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston's work  being entitled \"The Scourge of Villainy\").  Apparently we must now  prefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of  whom gossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold  impertinent fellow...a perpetual talker and made a noise like a  drum in a room.  So one time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats  him and seals up his mouth (that is his upper and nether beard)  with hard wax.  From him Ben Jonson takes his Carlo Buffone  ['i.e.', jester] in \"Every Man in His Humour\" ['sic'].\"  Is it  conceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing Marston, and that  the point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of  \"the grand scourge or second untruss\" with \"the scurrilous and  profane\" Chester?    We have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify  the difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the  allusions in these forgotten quarrels.  We are on sounder ground of  fact in recording other manifestations of Jonson's enmity.  In \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4028"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (#2)"],[1,"a, that most ancient town of Italy, where too are plenty of gentle  folk. In Pisa also there are some, and I have discovered them in many  parts of Christendom; and in this state also the breed exists, men  devoted to the profession of arms; for not many years ago a young man,  called Luca Cellini, a beardless youth, fought with a soldier of  experience and a most valorous man, named Francesco da Vicorati, who had  frequently fought before in single combat. This Luca, by his own valour,  with sword in hand, overcame and slew him, with such bravery and  stoutness that he moved the folk to wonder, who were expecting quite the  contrary issue; so that I glory in tracing my descent from men of valour.    As for the trifling honours which I have gained for my house, under the  well-known conditions of our present ways of living, and by means of my  art, albeit the same are matters of no great moment, I will relate these  in their proper time and place, taking much more pride in having been  born humble and having laid some honourable foundation for my family,  than if I had been born of great lineage and had stained or overclouded  that by my base qualities. So then I will make a beginning by saying how  it pleased God I should be born.    Note 1. He is alluding to the name 'Fluenzia,' which some antiquaries of  his day thought to have been the earliest name of the city, derived from  its being near 'Arno Fluente.' I have translated the word 'fluente' in  the text literally, though of course it signifies situated on a flowing  river. I need not call attention to the apocryphal nature of Cellinis  own derivation from the name of his supposed ancestor.    III    MY ancestors dwelt in Val d Ambra, where they owned large estates, and  lived like little lords, in retirement, however, on account of the then  contending factions. They were all men devoted to arms and of notable  bravery. In that time one of their sons, the younger, who was called  Cristofano, roused a great feud with certain of their friends and  neighbours. Now the heads of the families on both sides took part in it,  and the fire kindled seemed to them so threatening that their houses  were like to perish utterly; the elders upon this consideration, in  concert with my own ancestors, removed Cristofano; and the other youth  with whom the quarrel began was also sent away. They sent their young  man to Siena. Our folk sent Cristofano to Florence; and there they  bought for him a little house in Via Chiara, close to the convent of S.  Orsola, and they also purchased for him some very good property near the  Ponte a Rifredi. The said Cristofano took wife in Florence, and had sons  and daughters; and when all the daughters had been portioned off, the  sons, after their fathers death, divided what remained. The house in  Via Chiara with some other trifles fell to the share of one of the said  sons, who had the name of Andrea. He also took wife, and had four male  children. The first was called Girolamo, the second Bartolommeo, the  third Giovanni, who was afterwards my father, and the fourth Francesco.  This Andrea Cellini was very well versed in architecture, as it was then  practised, and lived by it as his trade. Giovanni, who was my father,  paid more attention to it than any of the other brothers. And since  Vitruvius says, amongst other things, that one who wishes to practise  that art well must have something of music and good drawing, Giovanni,  when he had mastered drawing, began to turn his mind to music, and  together with the theory learned to play most excellently on the viol  and the flute; and being a person of studious habits, he left his home  but seldom.    They had for neighbour in the next house a man called Stefano Granacci,  who had several daughters, all of them of remarkable beauty. As it  pleased God, Giovanni noticed one of these girls who was named  Elisabetta; and she found such favour with him that he asked her in  marriage. The fathers of both of them being well acquainted through  their close neighbourhood, it was easy to make this match up; and each  thought that he had very well arranged his affairs. First of all the two  good old men agreed upon the marriage; then they began to discuss the  dowry, which led to a certain amount of friendly difference; for Andrea  said to Stefano: My son Giovanni is the stoutest youth of Florence, and  of all Italy to boot, and if I had wanted earlier to have him married, I  could have procured one of the largest dowries which folk of our rank  get in Florence: whereupon Stefano answered: You have a thousand  reasons on your side; but here am I with five daughters and as many  sons, and when my reckoning is made, this is as much as I can possibly  afford. Giovanni, who had been listening awhile unseen by them,  suddenly broke in and said: O my father, I have sought and loved that  girl and not their money. Ill luck to those who seek to fill their  pockets by the dowry of their wife! As you have boasted that I am a  fellow of such parts, do you not think that I shall be able to provide  for my wife and satisfy her needs, even if I receive something short of  the portion you would like to get? Now I must make you understand that  the woman is mine, and you may take the dowry for yourself. At this  Andrea Cellini, who was a man of rather awkward temper, grew a trifle  angry; but after a few days Giovanni took his wife, and never asked for  other portion with her.    They enjoyed their youth and wedded love through eighteen years, always  greatly desiring to be blessed with children. At the end of this time  Giovannis wife miscarried of two boys through the unskilfulness of the  doctors. Later on she was again with child, and gave birth to a girl,  whom they called Cosa, after the mother of my father. [1] At the end of  two years she was once more with child; and inasmuch as those longings  to which pregnant women are subject, and to which they pay much  attention, were now exactly the same as those of her former pregnancy,  they made their minds up that she would give birth to a female as  before, and agreed to call the child Reparata, after the mother of my  mother. It happened that she was delivered on a night of All Saints,  following the feast-day, at half-past four precisely, in the year 1500.  [2] The midwife, who knew that they were expecting a girl, after she had  washed the baby and wrapped it in the fairest white linen, came softly  to my father Giovanni and said: I am bringing you a fine present, such  as you did not anticipate. My father, who was a true philosopher, was  walking up and down, and answered: What God gives me is always dear to  me; and when he opened the swaddling clothes, he saw with his own eyes  the unexpected male child. Joining together the palms of his old hands,  he raised them with his eyes to God, and said Lord, I thank Thee with  my whole heart; this gift is very dear to me; let him be Welcome. All  the persons who were there asked him joyfully what name the child should  bear. Giovanni would make no other answer than Let him be  Welcome-Benvenuto; [3] and so they resolved, and this name was given me  at Holy Baptism, and by it I still am living with the grace of God.    Note 1. Cosa is Florentine for Niccolòsa.    Note 2. The hour is reckoned, according to the old Italian fashion, from  sunset of one day to sunset of the next-twenty-four hours.    Note 3. Benvenuto means Welcome.    IV    ANDREA CELLINI was yet alive when I was about three years old, and he  had passed his hundredth. One day they had been altering a certain  conduit pertaining to a cistern, and there issued from it a great  scorpion unperceived by them, which crept down from the cistern to the  ground, and slank away beneath a bench. I saw it, and ran up to it, and  laid my hands upon it. It was so big that when I had it in my little  hands, it put out its tail on one side, and on the other thrust forth  both its mouths. [1] They relate that I ran in high joy to my  grandfather, crying out: Look, grandpapa, at my pretty little crab.  When he recognised that the creature was a scorpion, he was on the point  of falling dead for the great fear he had and anxiety about me. He  coaxed and entreated me to give it him; but the more he begged, the  tighter I clasped it, crying and saying I would not give it to any one.  My father, who was also in the house, ran up when he heard my screams,  and in his stupefaction could not think how to prevent the venomous  animal from killing me. Just then his eyes chanced to fall upon a pair  of scissors; and so, while soothing and caressing me, he cut its tail  and mouths off. Afterwards, when the great peril had been thus averted,  he took the occurrence for a good augury.    When I was about five years old my father happened to be in a  basement-chamber of our house, where they had been washing, and where a  good fire of oak-logs was still burning; he had a viol in his hand, and  was playing and singing alone beside the fire. The weather was very  cold. Happening to look into the fire, he spied in the middle of those  most burning flames a little creature like a lizard, which was sporting  in the core of the intensest coals. Becoming instantly aware of what the  thing was, he had my sister and me called, and pointing it out to us  children, gave me a great box on the ears, which caused me to howl and  weep with all my might. Then he pacified me good-humouredly, and spoke  as follows: My dear little boy, I am not striking you for any wrong  that you have done, but only to make you remember that that lizard which  you see in the fire is a salamander, a creature which has never been  seen before by any one of whom we have credible information. So saying,  he kissed me and gave me some pieces of money.    Note 1. The word is 'bocche,' so I have translated it by 'mouths.' But  Cellini clearly meant the gaping claws of the scorpion.    V    MY "]]]
