Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.--  The addressee was Liszt's former teacher, the celebrated Viennese  teacher of music and composer of innumerable instructive works  (1791-1857).]    My very dear Master,    When I think of all the immense obligations under which I am  placed towards you, and at the same time consider how long I have  left you without a sign of remembrance, I am perfectly ashamed  and miserable, and in despair of ever being forgiven by you!  \"Yes,\" I said to myself with a deep feeling of bitterness, \"I am  an ungrateful fellow; I have forgotten my benefactor, I have  forgotten that good master to whom I owe both my talent and my  success.\"...At these words a tear starts to my eyes, and I assure  you that no repentant tear was ever more sincere! Receive it as  an expiation, and pardon me, for I cannot any longer bear the  idea that you have any ill-feeling towards me. You will pardon  me, my dear Master, won't you? Embrace me then...good! Now my  heart is light.    You have doubtless heard that I have been playing your admirable  works here with the greatest success, and all the glory ought to  be given to you. I intended to have played your variations on the  \"Pirate\" the day after tomorrow at a very brilliant concert that  I was to have given at the theater of H.R.H. Madame, who was to  have been present as well as the Duchess of Orleans; but man  proposes and God disposes. I have suddenly caught the measles,  and have been obliged to say farewell to the concert; but it is  not given up because it is put off, and I hope, as soon as ever I  am well again, to have the pleasure of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#2)"],[1,"directed by a Will--Their Restless Character                                     CHAPTER IV.

PLAIN HINTS ON MICROSCOPES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT.

The microscope is rapidly becoming the companion of every intelligent  family that can afford its purchase, and, thanks to the skill of our  opticians, instruments which can be made to answer the majority of  purposes may be purchased for three or four guineas, while even those  whose price is counted in shillings are by no means to be despised. The  most eminent English makers, Wales, and Tolles, in America, and  Hartnack, in Paris, occupy the first rank, while the average productions  of respectable houses exhibit so high a degree of excellence as to make  comparisons invidious. We shall not, therefore, indulge in the praises  of particular firms, but simply recommend any reader entering upon  microscopic study to procure an achromatic instrument, if it can be  afforded, and having at least two powers, one with a focus of an inch or  two thirds of an inch, and the other of half or a quarter. Cheap  microscopes have usually only one eye-piece, those of a better class  have two, and the best are furnished with three, or even more.    The magnifying power of a compound microscope depends upon the focal  length of the object-glass (or glass nearest the object), upon the  length of the tube, and the power of the eye-piece. With regard to  object-glasses, those of shortest focal length have the highest powers,  and the longest eye-pieces have the lowest powers. The body of a  microscope, or principal tube of which it is composed, is, in the best  instruments, about nine inches long, and a draw tube, capable of being  extended six inches more, is frequently useful. From simple optical  principles, the longer the tube the higher the power obtained with the  same object-glass; but only object-glasses of very perfect construction  will bear the enlargement of their own imperfections, which results from  the use of long tubes; and consequently for cheap instruments the  opticians often limit the length of the tube, to suit the capacity of  the object-glasses they can afford to give for the money. Such  microscopes may be good enough for the generality of purposes, but they  do not, with glasses of given focal length, afford the same magnifying  power as is done by instruments of better construction. The best and  most expensive glasses will not only bear long tubes, but also  eye-pieces of high power, without any practical diminution of the  accuracy of their operation, and this is a great convenience in natural  history investigations. To obtain it, however, requires such perfection  of workmanship as to be incompatible with cheapness. An experienced  operator will not be satisfied without having an object-glass at least  as high as a quarter, that will bear a deep eye-piece, but beginners are  seldom successful with a higher power than one of half-inch focus, or  thereabouts, and before trying this, they should familiarise themselves  with the use of one with an inch focus.    It is a popular error to suppose that enormous magnification is always  an advantage, and that a microscope is valuable because it makes a flea  look as big as a cat or a camel. The writer has often smiled at the  exclamations of casual visitors, who have been pleased with his  microscopic efforts to entertain them. \"Dear me, what a wonderful  instrument; it must be immensely powerful;\" and so forth. These  ejaculations have often followed the use of a low power, and their  authors have been astonished at receiving the explanation that the best  microscope is that which will show the most with the least  magnification, and that accuracy of definition, not mere increase of  bulk, is the great thing needful.    Scientific men always compute the apparent enlargement of the object by  _one_ dimension only. Thus, supposing an object one hundredth of an inch  square were magnified so as to appear one inch square, it would, in  scientific parlance, be magnified to \"one hundred diameters,\" or one  hundred linear; and the figures 100 would be appended to any drawing  which might be made from it. It is, however, obvious that the length is  magnified as well as the breadth; and hence the magnification of the  whole surface, in the instance specified, would be one hundred"]]]
