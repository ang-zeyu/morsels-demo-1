Vol. 1 (of 3) (#2)"],[1,"unfortunate,\" I exclaimed. \"No, no,\" said Burton, \"it is  impossible they could have overheard us, besides, they may have only  just got there.\"    \"Well, _coute qui coute_, I will venture.\"    \"And I will watch.\"    The next moment I was bowing profoundly with all the grace I could  muster. \"I fear I am too presumptuous in hoping that you do not quite  forget me.\"    She gazed on me at first with such a puzzled but full and steady glance  from her dark clear grey eyes, that I felt ashamed of myself; then  again sparkling all over with a smile and look of recognition, she held  out her hand, saying quietly--\"I am very stupid not to know you at  once, but the moustache alters you, and it is a long time since I saw  you; how is your brother?\"    I was electrified--the most cutting declaration that my flimsy artifice  was seen thro', could not have perplexed me more. A momentary glance  showed me Burton, standing transfixed, with mouth and eyes wide open;  then rallying my scattered ideas I hastened to avail myself of this  happy mistake, and answered that my brother was quite well, and would  be delighted to hear I had met her. She bowed. But I had a brother,  could she really know him? Her next words solved the problem: \"How did  he like your leaving the regiment? It was so pleasant to be always  together,\" murmuring something of submission to necessity. I begged  her to join the quadrille then forming, to which, after some slight  hesitation, she assented, saying to her friends, \"Shall I find you  here?\" \"Yes,\" said \"he of the seals,\" as G. P. R. James would call him,  \"I am glad you are going to dance;\" the little woman gave her a smile  and a nod, and we joined the quadrille. Longing to draw her from her  reminiscences which kept me in a frightful state of mind lest I should  make a false step, not daring to start almost any topic lest it should  betray me, I feel convinced I presented an illustration of the acme of  boobyism. At length I ventured to remark that I was surprised not to  have seen her at any of the oratorios; this was true at all events. \"We  only came over for yesterday's performances,\" she said, \"and arriving  very early we got up near the orchestra. How superb that double chorus  was. I should like to have heard it in some huge dim cathedral; the  theatric decorations of that concert room seemed to jar upon the eye.\"    \"Yes! I quite agree with you; I am certain had I heard it under those  circumstances I should have been ready to shave my head, tie a cord  round my waist, and join the Franciscans _sur l'instant_!\"    I felt more at ease--\"If I can avoid my brother and the old regiment I  am tolerably safe.\" I thought--\"if I could get the smallest glimpse of  who I am I should go ahead famously.\"    A few more sentences, broken by the movements of the dance, when my  partner, returning to me, again threw me off my centre, by suddenly  raising her eyes to mine with a sort of demure merriment sparkling in  them, saying, \"You have not enquired for any of your old friends! But,  military memories are proverbially short, and yours is no exception  I fear.\" Passing over the dangerous commencement of this speech, I  launched into a glowing defence of military memories in general, and  my own in particular, and wound up by entreating her to give me the  fullest intelligence of all my old friends. She shook her head, \"Ah!  those generalities speak but badly of the kindliness of recollection I  like.\" Good Heavens! I was getting deeper in the mire; the rich soft  tones that could not be uttered by any one not possessed both of heart  and intellect, seemed to sink into mine! So, hastily stammering that  she did me great injustice, I reiterated my request for all the news  she could impart. \"I suppose you know all about the--\"    \"I cannot remember the numbers of regiments,\" said she, looking to me  for the word.    \"Oh! of course,\" said I hastily, \"a copious correspondence places me  pretty well _au fond_.\"    \"Yes! but my cousin, I know you will be glad to hear though you have  not the grace to ask, is still abroad, and, I hear, as beautiful as  ever, and refusing all that princes and peers can offer to induce her  again to try the lottery of marriage.\"    \"Ah! the loved are not always soon forgotten,\" said I, trying to chime  in with the tone of subdued feeling which seemed to pervade all my  fair companion said. She looked at me with an air of disapprobation  and replied gravely, \"Notwithstanding their great disparity of years,  my cousin did truly and deeply feel her husband's loss.\" I had better  take care! could I but draw her off from her confounded cousin! At  that moment she dropped her fan; I looked at it for a moment before  restoring it to her; it was antique, with gold sticks, and of great  value, the only part of her toilet that bespoke wealth. \"You remember  that fan and Lady Desmond's grand ball?\" said she smiling. \"Indeed I  do,\" I exclaimed, enraptured to have learned at one _coup_ that Dublin  was the scene of our acquaintance and that Lady Desmond was a mutual  friend. Here, however, the quadrille ended, and accepting my arm, my  unknown belle turned her steps and mine, _malgr√© moi_, in the direction  of the oft mentioned pillars, near which we had left her chaperons;  but those deserving individuals had, with praiseworthy carelessness,  disappeared, and my companion after looking round in vain, said, in a  somewhat anxious tone, \"they are certainly not here, I shall never find  them again.\" I suggested the probability of nature requiring support,  and that the refreshment room would be the most likely place in which  to recover her lost guardians.    Assenting to this, and to my proposal of an ice, we were soon moving  _en masse_ with the other dancers towards the tea rooms, and now, freed  _pro. tem._ from the incubus of cousins and brothers, whom my partner  appeared to forget in her keen appreciation of the many ridiculous  points in the mob around her, I felt my spirits rise to concert pitch,  the embargo on my tongue removed, and, fancying myself most agreeable,  the passage to the refreshment table seemed to me to be performed with  miraculous rapidity.--Here, after a short inspection, we discovered  the missing individuals, and hastening towards them with speed I  thought rather ungracious, this puzzling, but fascinating girl, with  an inclination of the head and a smile in which much suppressed mirth  seemed struggling, dropped my arm and took her station beside her  incongruous companions. But I was not to be so easily sent adrift; I  had not served a twelve or thirteen years' apprenticeship to ball rooms  to be thus dismissed if I choose to stay; so with a deferential bow, \"I  shall bring your ice here,\" said I; and rapidly securing one, I had  the satisfaction of hearing her say, as I approached with it, as if in  continuation of something, \"knew him slightly in Dublin, a long time  ago;\" which, in some measure, placed me _au dessous des cartes_; for if  only a slight acquaintance, I could not be expected to have very many  subjects or reminiscences in common with her; so resolutely determined  to stand my ground, have another dance, learn who she really was, and,  if possible, lay the foundation of a future acquaintance, I took up  a position beside the beautiful incognita, and ventured to discuss  Ireland in a guarded and general manner, observing, with perfect truth,  that two of the pleasantest years of my life had been spent there. I  could perceive a decided increase of cordiality in Miss ---- (what would  I not have given to know the name) as I pronounced this eulogy on her  native country--for I had soon guessed, by the indescribable spirit  of frankness, arch, yet tempered with a certain dignity in its gay  _abandon_, which pervaded her manner, that she was Irish--and just as  she had turned laughingly to answer some playful charge against its  characteristics, spoken apparently through a medium of mashed potatoes  in his throat, by the man with the seals, Burton touched my arm,  \"Egerton, don't keep all your luck to yourself, introduce me.\"    \"Hold your tongue--for Heaven's sake, my dear fellow,\" I exclaimed in a  rapid aside--\"don't breathe my name: at this moment I have not the most  remote idea who I am, and am constantly on the verge of an unpardonable  scrape; be silent and begone, I will tell you all afterwards.\" Silenced  and amazed, poor Burton retired, and my unknown friend, turning to me  as I stood elate at having conquered difficulties, again showed me  my uncertain footing by observing--\"But you used to cherish the most  heretical opinions on these points, and offend me not a little by their  open avowal.\" What an ill-bred savage she must identify me with! \"Raw  boys are always odious and irrational; you should not have deigned to  listen to me,\" said I in despair.    \"Oh! you were by no means a raw boy, you looked quite as old as you do  now; besides, it is not half a century since we met,\" she replied, with  another distracting look; and then--with a merry burst of apparently  irrepressible laughter, in which, though I could not account for it,  her friends and myself joined--it was so infectious, added--\"You  must forgive me, but really your reminiscences seem to be in such  inextricable confusion, I cannot help laughing.\" In an agony lest all  should be discovered--with the respectable couple before-mentioned for  umpires, I urged in defence \"that my memory was like the background  of a picture from which one figure alone stood out clear and well  defined.\" Then, observing that she was beating time to the sound of a  most delicious waltz just begun, \"Am I too unreasonable to ask for a  waltz as well as a quadrille,\" I said. She half shook her head, then,  smiling to her companions, observed--\"It is so long since I had a  waltz I cannot resist it; shall I keep you too late, _Caro Maestro_?\"  \"No, no,\" said the lady with the cap, \"we will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#2)"],[1,"Africa--how can we best  secure this? The abiding difficulty at the Cape and throughout the  states that will form the future South African Confederation is the  colour question. The \"colour\" is not that of the gold to be found so  often in many places, but the question of the white and the black races  dwelling in the same country.    Dutchman and Englishman will in time form one race. There is nothing to  part them. They are European cousins. They both come from North Europe.  The blood of the Dutchman runs in the veins of the Englishman. The  parent stock of the Dutch gave off many a swarm wherewith to people the  East Anglian shores. England has been fed and fought by the Dutch since  those old days. We have received many of their sturdy countrymen into  London. Any one who does not know the number and influence of the Dutch  in comparatively recent times in our metropolis should pay a visit to  the Austen Friars, the place where the monks of St. Augustine had their  headquarters in the city, and see the fine old church the Dutch built,  and in which they still worship. We remember well the stiff battles of  Charles II.'s time. We know the names of Van Tromp and De Witt as well  as any Dutchman. We have learned to respect our Dutch cousins, both on  sea and land.    And their religion? There is nothing there to separate us. Has the  Presbyterian form of religion kept Scotland separate? No, save in the  pride of her ancient history. No Scotsman has any objection to marry an  English lass, especially if she has herself more than will give both of  them something better than oatcake. And the Dutch Reformed Church is  much like the Presbyterian. There is nothing that can in its tenets  form any bar to the mixing of the British and Dutch people in South  Africa. To be sure, a \"nacht-maal\" is not precisely a Church of England  convocation or congress. It approaches much nearer to a Scottish  communion service in out-of-the-way Highland parishes. There is nothing  aggressive or exclusive in the staid and sober faith of our Dutch  friends. And this being so, Scotsmen especially have intermarried often  with the Boers.    As trustee of a Highland estate, some time ago my consent was asked to  the granting of a leasehold to a Scottish gentleman, who had returned  from the Transvaal. The only objection the lawyer who asked the question  mentioned as existing against this man was that he was said to have  married a native. Some canny objectors had written a letter saying that  this ought to form a bar to any grant of land to the man, though he had  originally come from the district. Who was the lady? was the next  inquiry. Was she a Hottentot Venus? Did she \"bang her hair\" in too  negroid a fashion? Would she introduce among the dim lights of the North  the terrible practices of her people? Would the quiet village be  scandalised by strange feasts and weird howlings? No, by no means. What  was she, then? Why, nothing but a nice flaxen-haired, rather  squab-featured, but withal comely Boer girl! So she entered into her  Highland possession, had a door \"stoop,\" or something like a bit of  raised verandah flooring put outside the entrance, but found, poor soul,  that it was rather a dripping place of observation in her adopted  climate. Nevertheless, the last news of her is that she is a happy,  \"sonsie\" mother, and has some children, who don't speak Dutch as their  common language, but only a few low Dutch words, with very Highland  accent.    But this is said to be only the case where a Scotsman marries a Boer.  There is apparently something in the Scot that makes him look after his  family more carefully than does the average Englishman or Irishman. It  is therefore only the Scot, as it is said, both in Africa and in Canada,  whose children, if he marry one of another race, do not desert the  accents of their forefathers on the paternal side. As a rule the  children become much what the mother is. I have seen the children of a  naval man who had married an Indian woman on the Pacific Coast become  almost like the small fish-eating savages around them. They were willing  to do a little work for a spurt, and then relapsed into dirt and  laziness. So in the north-west of Canada it is only an Orkney or  Aberdeen east-coast Scot who can keep his family to civilised life, if  he marry a Cree or member of any other Indian tribe. The Frenchman's  children, by an Indian mother, take to hunting only. Even with the Scots  in Old Canada the same rule holds good, at least wherever a Celt has  married a French Canadian. There are numbers of families below Quebec,  on the north side of the river St. Lawrence, whose names are Highland.  They are the descendants chiefly of Fraser's Highlanders, one of the  regiments employed during the war against the French in 1748-49. When  the soldiers obtained grants of land on the conclusion of the war they  married French-Canadian women. Their descendants now can seldom speak  one word of English or of Gaelic. They speak nothing but Canadian French  patois. It is the mother's influence, with rare exceptions, that tells.  So it is in South Africa. In some districts it is as with Fraser's  Highlanders, in Province Quebec. You may visit farm after farm,  especially those whose owners have Irish names, and you will not find  any person in the house, or on the land belonging to the farm, who can  speak a word of either English or Irish! It may be doubted if there  would have been much loyalty taught to any government by the use of the  Erse tongue. The \"Taal\" may inculcate a certain amount more of respect  for paternal and government authority. Yet if theory distinguishes  between Briton and Boer, or Englishman and Africander, Nature does not,  and you find that the mingling of the races is a practical principle  acted on regularly wherever the races are brought together. We may  congratulate ourselves that this is so. The mixed race will be a  magnificent one, with the size, courage, and tenacity of the Dutch, and  the gentleness, bravery, and power of government and of cohesion of the  Britisher. There are no handsomer women anywhere than there are among  the Dutch ladies of Cape Colony. Many of their sons are sent to English  public schools and universities, and though there are, alas, only too  many who live under British institutions and who do not become British,  there is no reason why, in course of time, they should not become as  good citizens of a British Commonwealth as have the Vanderbilts and Van  Horns and Roosevelts, and many others of Dutch name and lineage in New  York State, for New York was New Amsterdam, and a very flourishing Dutch  colony. On the banks of the Hudson you may still see thoroughly Dutch  houses, built in the old days. What New Yorker would now change his  nationality, though of Dutch descent? The freedom they have in the  United States their cousins will also have in South Africa. They will  mix with the English, whose language most of them speak already. They  will do so all the more readily as time passes, in that they can never  feel themselves to be anything but the equals of the British in all save  in numbers.    It was for the benefit of the union between England and Scotland that  the Scots won Bannockburn and many another hard fight besides. They  could point to their victories as the English could to theirs. And so  with those of Dutch race at the Cape. They can point to famous names of  good soldiers, who have inflicted defeat on the best British troops. And  for this they will be all the greater friends hereafter. Unless each  partner in business or in marriage can bring something into the common  pot, there is not so happy a sense of helpfulness and mutual aid given,  as there is when this union is a more equal one. There is another and a  most weighty consideration which will tend to the union of the European  races. This is the common necessity each has to strengthen the other  against any possible predominance of the blacks. The danger in this  matter will arise more in the warmer regions of the north of the future  confederation than in the more temperate south. Time has proved that the  white races can do well in the Cape. They increase rapidly. The climate  is most favourable. The physical character of the races does not in any  way deteriorate. On the contrary, it improves. They gain, as the  Americans say, in \"avoirdupois.\" An \"avoirdupois\" Dutchman at the Cape,  whose ancestors have been \"avoirdupoising\" there for two centuries, is a  better all-round, and very round man, than is his compatriot in race at  home among the canals and tulip gardens of Holland. But the black holds  his own in weight and in numbers even in the temperate climate of the  Cape Colony. Farther north, where the temperature is hotter, it is  certain that he will be a better man than the white. The only exception  to this can be in the mountain districts, where at high elevations in  the plateaus there is probably a possibility that the white man's  children may thrive. In general, however, in all the low ground north of  the Transvaal, and in many districts there, the \"Kaffir\" will be more  favoured by the climate than will be the white invader. The Europeans  will partially subject them, and partially they will remain,  deteriorated in morals, but by no means likely to remain only the  obedient servants that they are expected to be. There are many who now  say that the next big trouble in South Africa will be with the blacks.  This apprehension, if there be any reason in it, is another incentive  for the whites to combine to make settlements secure and numerous, where  they can defy any movement among the blacks. It is an additional  incentive to us in the old land to see what we may do to make this union  of the whites as British in feeling, as liberty loving, as British  institutions can make it. The Boers in fighting have not lost their  freedom. They have only "]]]
