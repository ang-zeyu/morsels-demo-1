In this, which was formerly the Chapel of  the Faithful, are represented several mysteries of our redemption; some  apostles, some holy martyrs, and in particular the transit of one of the  righteous from this life, on whom the archangel, St. Michael, is seen  bestowing his assistance. Here the symbols, the workmanship, the design,  the attitudes, the drapery of the figures, and the characters united,  permit us not to doubt that the painting must be much anterior to the  revival of the arts in Italy. But most writers seem to trace the  rudiments of Venetian painting from the eleventh century, about the year  1070, at the period when the Doge Selvo invited the mosaic workers from  Greece to adorn the magnificent temple, consecrated to St. Mark the  Evangelist. Such artificers, however rude, must have been acquainted, in  some degree, with the art of painting; none being enabled to work in  mosaic who had not previously designed and coloured, upon pasteboard or  cartoon, the composition they intended to execute.    And these, observe the same writers, were the first essays of the art of  painting in Venice. However this may be, it speedily took root, and  began to flourish after the year 1204, when Constantinople being taken,  Venice was in a short time filled, not indeed with Grecian artists, but  with their pictures, statues, and bassi relievi.[6] Had I not here  restricted my observations to existing specimens of the art, bestowing  only a rapid glance upon the rest, along with their authors, I might  prove, that from the above period, the city was no longer destitute of  artists; and was enabled, in the thirteenth century, to form a company  of them with their appropriate laws and institutions.    But of these elder masters of the art, there remains either only the  name, as of a Giovanni da Venezia and a Martinello da Bassano, or some  solitary relic of their labours without a name, as in the sarcophagus,  in wood, of the Beata Giuliana, painted about the year 1262, the same in  which she died. This monument remains in her own monastery of San Biagio  alla Guidecca, long held in veneration, even after the body of the  blessed saint had been removed, in the year 1297, into an urn of stone.  There are there represented San Biagio, the titular saint of the church,  San Cataldo, the bishop, and the blessed Giuliana, the two former in an  upright, the latter in a kneeling posture; their names are written in  Latin, and the style, although coarse, is nevertheless not Greek.  Probably that of the painter is also in the same corner, a picture of  whom, a Pieta, has recently been discovered by the Ab. Boni, who  considers him a new Cimabue of the Venetian art. As it has already been  described by him in his Florentine collection of \"Opuscoli  Scientifici,\"[7] I shall not extend my account of it; for the reader  will there find other names, as will afterwards be shewn, recently  discovered by the indefatigable author of some early Venetian writers,  until this period unknown to history. Among these are Stefano Pievano,  of S. Agnese, a picture by whom, dated 1381, is described; Alberegno,  belonging to the fifteenth century, and one Esegrenio, who flourished  somewhat later, to which time we may refer two fine and highly valued  figures of holy virgins, not long since discovered, of Tommaso da  Modena, and which, from the disputes they have elicited, have been  subjected to experiments at Florence, to ascertain whether they are  painted in oil or distemper--experiments that tend only to prove that  this Tommaso was unacquainted with the art of colouring in oil.    It was only subsequent to the year 1300, that the names, united to the  productions of the Venetians, began to make themselves manifest; when,  partly by the examples held out by Giotto, partly by their own assiduity  and talent, the painters of the city and of the state visibly improved,  and softened the harshness of their manner. Giotto, according to a MS.  cited by Rossetti,[8] was at Padua in 1306; according to Vasari, he  returned from Avignon in 1316; and a little while afterwards he was  painting at Verona, in the palace of Can della Scala, and at Padua,  employed on a chapel in the church of the titular saint. He adds, that  towards the close of his days he was again invited there, and  embellished other places with his pieces. Nothing, however, remains of  him in Verona; but in Padua there still exists the chapel of the  Nunziata all'Arena, divided all round into compartments, in each of  which is represented some scriptural event. It is truly surprising to  behold, not less on account of its high state of preservation, beyond  any other of his frescos, than for its full expression of native grace,  together with that air of grandeur which Giotto so well knew how to  unite. With respect to the chapel, it is believed that Vasari was less  accurately informed, inasmuch as Savonarola, who has been cited by Sig.  Morelli,[9] relates that Giotto ornamented the little church of the  Arena, _capitulumque Antonii nostri_, and the chapter _of our St.  Antony_. And in fact, in the apartment of the chapter house, there yet  remain several traces of ancient painting, though turned white with age.  In a very ancient MS., of the year 1312,[10] there is made mention of  his also having been employed _in Palatio Comitis_, which others suppose  ought to be read _Communis_, intended to apply to the Saloon, of which I  shall shortly have to give some account.    To Giotto succeeded Giusto Padovano, so called from the place of his  naturalization and usual residence; being, in truth, a Florentine,  sprung from the family of the Menabuoi. As a disciple of Giotto, Vasari  attributes to him the very extensive work which adorns the church of St.  John the Baptist. In the picture over the altar, if it be his, Giusto  has exhibited various histories of St. John the Baptist; on the walls  are represented both scriptural events and mysteries of the Apocalypse;  and on the cupola he has drawn a Choir of Angels, where we behold, as if  in a grand consistory, the blessed arrayed in various garments, seated  upon the ground; simple, indeed, in its conception, but executed with an  incredible degree of diligence and felicity. It is mentioned in the  _Notizia Morelli_, that formerly there was to be read there an  inscription over one of the gates--_Opus Johannis et Antonii de  Padua_,--probably companions of Giusto, and, probably, as is conjectured  by the author of the MS. above alluded to, the painters of the whole  temple. This would seem to augment the number of the Paduan artists, no  less than the imitators of Giotto; since the works, already described,  are equally as much in his manner as those by Taddeo Gaddi, or any other  of his fellow pupils in Florence. The same commendation is bestowed upon  Jacopo Davanzo, of whom I treat more at length in the school of Bologna.  A less faithful follower of Giotto was Guariento, a Paduan, held in high  esteem about the year 1360, as appears from the honourable commissions  he obtained from the Venetian senate. One of his frescos and a  crucifixion yet remain at Bassano;[11] and in the choir of the  Eremitani, at Padua, there are many of his figures now retouched, from  which Zanetti took occasion to commend him for his rich invention, the  spirit of his attitudes, and the felicity with which, at so early a  period, he disposed his draperies. At Padua there is an ancient church,  dedicated to St. George, erected about 1377, which boasts some history  pieces of St. James, executed by the hand of Alticherio, or Aldigieri,  da Zevio in the Veronese; and others of St. John, the work of one  Sebeto,[12] says the historian, a native of Verona. These, likewise,  approach pretty nearly the style of Giotto, and more especially the  first, who painted also a good deal in his native place.    To these two I may add Jacopo da Verona, known only by his numerous  paintings in fresco at San Michele of Padua, which remain in part  entire; and Taddeo Bartoli, of Siena, who has shewn himself ambitious at  the Arena, of emulating the contiguous labours of Giotto, without  attaining the object in view. Another production of the same period is  seen in the great hall at Padua, reported to be one of the largest in  the world, consisting, as it does, of a mixture of sacred historic  pieces, of celestial signs borrowed from Igino, and of the various  operations carried on during the respective months of the year, besides  several other ideas certainly furnished by some learned man of that age.  It is partly the work, says Morelli in his _Notizia_, upon the authority  of Campagnuola, of an artist of Ferrara, and partly that of Gio.  Miretto, a Paduan. This recent discovery justifies my own previous  opinions, having been unable to prevail upon myself to ascribe such a  production to Giotto, although it partakes strongly of his style, which  appears to have spread pretty rapidly throughout the territories of  Padua, of Verona, of Bergamo, and great part of the Terra Ferma.    Besides this manner, which may be, in some measure, pronounced foreign,  there are others equally observable in Venice, no less than in Treviso,  in the Chapter of the Padri Predicatori, and in other of the subject  cities, and these might more accurately be termed national, so remote  are they from the style of Giotto, and that of his disciples before  mentioned. I have elsewhere pointed out how far the miniature painters  contributed to this degree of originality, a class of artists, with whom  Italy, at no time destitute, more fully abounded about that period,  while they still continued to improve by employing their talents in  drawing objects from the life, and not from any Greek or Italian model.  Indeed they had already made no slight advances in every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34672"],[0,"Fish Stories (#2)"],[1,"and  of necessity. Long legs were, therefore, required in his business,  and having begun life with a pair of long legs, Bill's body was  mounted, so to speak, on stilts, high in the air, and he found it  necessary to grow a long neck so that when he presented his bill it  might reach to the ground. This long neck was ordinarily carried  gracefully looped back above his body in the form of a letter S. On  the rare occasions when Bill straightened this crooked neck of his,  it shot out with the speed of an electric spark, and he never was  known to miss the object aimed at.    At the upper end of Bill's long neck his small head was secured, and  from it drooped an eight inch beak, which opened and closed like a  pair of tailor's shears.    Bill wore a coat of the same color as a French soldier's uniform and  his family name was Heron--Blue Heron. Bill had cousins named Crane  and he was distantly related to a fellow who, with queer family  traditions, paraded under the name of Stork.      [Illustration: Bill]    Bill did not belong to the union; he worked eighteen hours a day. His  operations, chiefly, were conducted in a shallow bay where a brook  emptied into the lake, directly opposite our cottage. There, Bill  might be seen during the season, in sunshine and in rain, from long  before sunrise until late at night, standing in the shallow water  near shore in an attitude which he copied from a Japanese fire  screen; or with Edwin Booth's majestic, tragedian stage tread, slowly  wading among the pond lily pads and pickerel grass; lifting high and  projecting forward in long deliberate strides, one foot after  another; each step being carefully placed before his weight was  shifted.    Though an awkward appearing person by himself, in a landscape Bill  made a picture of symmetry and beauty and his march was the very  poetry of motion.    Bill had very definite opinions concerning boats. He knew that they  were generally occupied by human animals, of whose intentions he was  always suspicious. Either through experience or inherited instinct,  he seemed to know exactly how far a shot-gun would carry. Bige and I  never had used one on him and we seldom had a gun up our sleeve while  in a boat, but Bill never allowed us to approach beyond the safety  line.    Day after day through many seasons Bill has stood and observed our  boat cross the lake. Without moving an eyelash he would watch our  approach until the boat reached a certain definite spot in the lake,  when with slow flap of wide spread wings he lifted his long legs,  trailing them far behind, while he flew up the lake behind the  island. As soon as we had passed about our business, Bill always  returned and resumed his job of fishing at the same old stand, where  he \"watchfully waited\" for something to turn up.    Bill was the most patient fisherman I ever knew. Neither Mr. Job nor  Woodrow Wilson had anything on Bill. His motto seemed to be, \"all  things come to him who can afford to wait.\"    Early in the season Mrs. Bill was busy with household duties. With  coarse sticks, brush, mud and moss, in the dead branches of a tall  pine, she built the family nest and laid the family eggs. She also  sat upon those eggs, with her long, spindly legs hanging straight  downward, one on either side of the nest, as one might sit upon a  saddle suspended in mid-air. When the brood of young herons were  hatched and could be left alone, the mother also went fishing with  Bill, and toward the end of the season the young birds were on the  job with mother and dad.    One day early in the season, Bige and I were crossing the lake. It  was about ten o'clock. Bill had been watchfully waiting at his old  stand since 3:30 A. M. One eye was now turned on the approaching  boat, but the other eye continued its search of the waters for the  long delayed morning meal. About this time, a yellow perch who also  was hunting a breakfast, discovered a minnow who had strayed into  deep water far from his home. Perchy immediately gave chase, while  the alarmed minnow swiftly darted toward safety in his birthplace  under a clump of pickerel grass near the shore. As they passed our  boat, the race was headed straight for a pair of yellow legs a few  rods away.    Ten seconds later, a snake like neck uncoiled and straightened while  an opened pair of shears, with lightning speed descended into the  water. When they lifted, the shears were closed across the body of a  half pound yellow perch. Bill thus held his fish an instant, then  tossed it in the air and it descended head first into his wide open  mouth. A swelling slowly moving downward marked the passage through a  long gullet into his crop, of a breakfast that six and a half hours  Bill had been patiently fishing for.    \"Sufferin' Maria!\" exclaimed Bige, \"What a lot of pleasure Bill had  swallowing that kicking, wriggling morsel of food down half a yard of  throat.\"        BIGE and I had been spending the day at Moose Pond. Going over early  in the morning, we went up the river about five miles, then followed  the tote-road around the western side of the mountain to an abandoned  lumber camp near the pond. This road had not been used for lumber  operations for ten years or more, but it still made a good foot path,  though to reach our destination it led us a long way around.    Returning late in the afternoon to Buck Mountain Camp, where we were  then staying, we decided to go directly over Moose Mountain, by a  shorter route, though the walking through the lumbered section of the  woods would be more difficult. In the bottom of the valley between  the two mountains, we crossed West Bay Brook. This brook we had  fished three or four miles below, near where it emptied into Cedar  Lake, but in this section where the stream was small, overgrown with  alders and covered with \"slash\" from the lumber operations, we had  not thought it worth the effort.      [Illustration: Dinner at Buck Mountain Camp]    There was an elbow in the brook at the place where we crossed it, and  a large tree lying across the stream had collected driftwood and  formed a dam above which was a deep pool about thirty feet in  diameter. Looking down from the bridge which the west wind had made  for us to cross upon, we saw that the pool was alive with trout. The  bottom seemed black with a solid army formation of fish, lying close  together, sides touching, heads up stream; while schools of smaller  trout, disturbed by our presence, swiftly swam around the pool  reflecting the bright sunshine in brilliant rainbow hues. The scene  was one to arrest the attention of the most casual observer, and Bige  and I lingered long upon the bridge watching the movements of the  hundreds of inhabitants of this natural aquarium.    On the way back to camp we discussed the possibilities of fishing  this pool, deciding upon the best place of approach, where one could  be partially concealed by bushes while casting. We spent all of the  following day marking a trail down the mountain and across the  valley, about three miles, from camp to the pool, cutting brush and  clearing out a path; then one day when the weather conditions were  favorable, Bige went out to headquarters to bring in some food  supplies and I, with a fly rod, went down over our new trail to catch  a few trout in a pool that had never been fished.    Cautiously approaching, when near the brook, I heard sounds of  splashing in the water. Creeping on hands and knees, then slowly on  stomach, I reached a position where, through the bushes, the surface  of the pool came into view, when, crawling up the opposite bank, I  saw a long, slender, shiny, water soaked, fur coated body which was  surmounted with a cat-like head; the legs were so short they were  invisible and the body appeared to drag upon the ground, while a  tapering tail about a foot long followed in the rear. The Otter,  including tail, was about three feet long and he had a trout in his  mouth which he deposited on the ground and immediately slid down the  bank and disappeared under the water. In less than a minute he  crawled up the bank again with another fish in his mouth, which was  dropped by the first one and the operation was repeated.    I do not know how long the otter had been fishing when I arrived, but  I watched him work fully fifteen minutes, when he came to the surface  without a fish. He then deliberately surveyed his catch, appearing to  gloat over it, after which he started down stream, tumbling in and  climbing out of the water as far as he could be seen and I heard him  several minutes after he had gone out of view.    Coming out of my cramped position of concealment, I crossed over on  the fallen tree and saw scattered over the opposite bank literally  scores of trout, large and small; some had their heads bitten off,  others were cut in half, all were mutilated. Obviously, the otter had  eaten his fill and then had continued to fish just for the joy of  killing, like some other trout-hogs in human form, such as we all  have met.      [Illustration: The Otter]    I went back to camp that night without fish. We visited the pool  later, several times, but never got a rise and never saw another  trout in that hole. The otter had made a perfect and complete job of  it. There was not left even a pair of trout for seed.        A TWENTY inch pickerel of my acquaintance, one day swallowed his  grandson. This was an exhibition of bad judgment on the part of  Grandad Pickerel. The mere fact of killing his near relative was not  in itself reprehensible, since, if all pickerel were not cannibals  they would soon exterminate from streams, ponds, and lakes, fishes of  all other species. But this particular \"pick\" was a husky youngster,  and while he might very properly have been bitten in half, or have  been chewed up into small pieces, the older fish got himself into  trouble when he swallowed the kid whole.
