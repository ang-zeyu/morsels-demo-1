The judgment, therefore, which he passes on each  artist, is not wholly to be despised, since he formed it on those of the  various professors then living in Rome, as Winckelmann has observed  (tom. i. p. 450); and, if these persons, as it is pretended, have erred  in their judgment on the Greek sculptors, they have certainly not erred  in their estimate of modern painters, particularly Luti, to whom I  imagine Pascoli, from esteem and intimacy, deferred more than to any  other artist.    We have from Bellori other lives, written with more learning and  criticism, some of which are supposed to be lost. He had originally  applied himself to painting, but deserted that art, as we may conjecture  from Pascoli (_vita del Canini_), and attached himself to poetry, and  the study of antiquities: and his skill in both arts manifests itself in  the lives he has left, which are few, but interspersed with interesting  and minute particulars of the characters of the painters and their  works. In his plan, he informs us he has followed the advice of Niccolo  Poussin. He composed also a \"Description of the figures painted by  Raffaello, in the churches of the Vatican;\" a tract which contains some  severe reflections on Vasari,[2] but is nevertheless highly useful. We  also find a profusion of entertaining anecdotes in Taja, in his  \"Description of the Vatican;\" and in Titi, in his account of the  pictures, sculpture, and architecture of Rome. This work has recently  been republished, with additions; and we shall occasionally quote it  under the name of the _Guide_. Pesaro is indebted for a similar _Guide_  to Signor Becci, and Ascoli and Perugia to Signor Baldassare Orsini, a  celebrated architect. We have also the _Lettere Perugine_ of Sig.  Dottore Annibale Mariotti, which treat of the early painters of Perugia,  with a store of information and critical acumen that render them highly  valuable. To these may also be added, the _Risposta_ of the above named  Sig. Orsini, whom I regret to see entering on Etruscan ground, as he  there repeats many ancient errors, which have been long exploded by  common consent: in other points it is a treatise worth perusal. If we  turn to _Descriptions_, we have them of several periods, as that of the  Basilica Loretana, and that of Assisi, composed by P. Angeli; and the  account of the Duomo of Orvieto, written by P. della Valle; and the  works on the churches of S. Francesco di Perugia, and S. Pietro di Fano,  by anonymous writers. The Abbate Colucci has favoured us with recent  notices on various artists of Piceno and Umbria, and Urbino, in his  _Antichita Picene_, extended, as far as my observation goes, to tom.  XXXI.[3] The learned authors whom I have named, and others to whom I  shall occasionally refer, have furnished the chief materials of my  present treatise, although I have myself collected a considerable part  from artists and lovers of art, either in conversation, or in my  correspondence. Thus far in the way of introduction.

I  have not, however, made an equal use of all; as I believe some pictures  to be copies, which are there referred to as originals; and as several  names there mentioned, may with propriety be omitted. In my references,  I shall often cite the collections; sometimes also the authors of some  more considerable treatises, as P. Civalli, Terzi, Sig. Agostino Rossi,  Sig. Arciprete Lazzari, respecting whom I must refer to the second  index, where will be found the titles of their respective works.]            ROMAN SCHOOL      EPOCH I.      _Early Artists._      If we turn our eyes for a moment to that tract of country which we have  designated as falling within the limits of the Roman School, amidst the  claims of modern art, we shall occasionally meet with both Greek and  Latin pictures of the rude ages; from the first of which we may  conclude, that Greek artists formerly painted in this part of Italy; and  from the latter, that our own countrymen were emulous to follow their  example. One of these artists is said to have had the name of Luca, and  to him is ascribed the picture of the Virgin, at S. Maria Maggiore, and  many others in Italy, which are believed to be painted by S. Luke the  Evangelist. Who this Luca was, or whether one painter or more of that  name ever existed, we shall presently inquire. The tradition was  impugned by Manni,[4] and after him by Piacenza, (tom. ii. p. 120,) and  is now only preserved among the vulgar, a numerous class indeed, who  shut their ears to every rational criticism as an innovation on their  faith. This vulgar opinion is alike oppugned by the silence of the early  artists, and the well attested fact, that in the first ages of the  church the Virgin was not represented with the holy Infant in her  arms;[5] but had her hands extended in the act of prayer. This is  exemplified in the funeral vase of glass in the Museo Trombelli at  Bologna, with the inscription MARIA, and in many bassirilievi of  christian sarcophagi, where she is represented in a similar attitude.  Rome possesses several of these specimens, and several are to be found  in Velletri.[6] It is however a common opinion, that these pictures are  by a painter of the name of Luca. Lami refers to a legend of the 14th  century of the Madonna dell'Impruneta, where they are said to be the  works of a Florentine of the name of Luca, who for his many christian  virtues obtained the title of saint.[7] They are not however all in the  same style, and some of them bear Greek inscriptions, whence we may  conclude that they are by various hands; although they all appear to be  painted in or about the 12th century. This tradition was not confined to  Italy alone, but found its way also into many of the eastern churches.  The author of the _Anecdotes des Beaux Arts_, relates that the memory of  a Luca, a hermit, who had painted many rude portraits of the Virgin, was  held in great veneration in Greece; and that through a popular  superstition he had succeeded to the title of S. Luke the Evangelist.  Tournefort (_Voyage, &c._) mentions an image of the Virgin at Mount  Lebanon, attributed by the vulgar to S. Luke; but which was doubtless  also the work of some Luke, a monk in one of the early ages.    More considerable remains both of the Greek and Italian artists of the  13th century are to be found in Assisi, as related in my first book; and  to those already mentioned as painted on the walls, may be added others  on panel, and all by unknown artists; particularly a crucifixion in S.  Chiara, of which there is a tradition, that it was painted before Giunta  appeared. Another picture anterior to this period, and bearing the date  of 1219, is to be seen at Subiaco; it is a consecration of a church, and  the painter informs us that _Conciolus pinxit_. If in addition to these  artists we inquire after the miniature painters, we may find specimens  of them in abundance, in the library of the Vatican, and other  collections in Rome. I shall name S. Agostino, in the public library of  Perugia, where the Redeemer is seen in the midst of saints, and the  opening of Genesis is painted in miniature; a design which, from the  angular folds of the drapery, partakes of the Greek style, but still  serves to prove this art to have been known at that time in Umbria. In  addition to what I have remarked, I may also observe, that in Perugia,  in the course of the same century, the artists were sufficiently  numerous to form an academy, as we may collect from the _Lettere  Perugine_, and these, when we consider the time, must have been in great  part miniature painters.    It is now time to notice Oderigi of Gubbio, a town very near to Perugia.  Vasari tells us that he was a man of celebrity, and a friend of Giotto,  in Rome; and Dante, in his second _Cantica_, calls him an honour to  Agobbio, and excelling in the art of miniature. These are the only  authorities that Baldinucci could have for transferring this ancient  artist to the school of Cimabue, and ingrafting him in his usual manner  on that stock. Upon these he founded his conjecture; and, according to  his custom, gave them more weight than they deserved. His opinion,  however amplified, reduces itself to the assumption that Giotto,  Oderigi, and Dante, were lovers of art, and common friends, and became  therefore acquainted in the school of Cimabue; a very uncertain  conclusion. We shall consider this subject more maturely in the school  of Bologna, since Oderigi lived there, and instructed Franco, from whom  Bologna dates the series of her painters. It is thought, too, that he  left some scholars in his native place, and not long after him, in 1321,  we find Cecco, and Puccio da Gubbio, engaged as painters of the  Cathedral of Orvieto; and about the year 1342, Guido Palmerucci of the  same place, employed in the palace of his native city. There remains a  work of his in fresco in the hall, much injured by time; but some  figures of saints are still preserved, which do not yield to the best  style of Giotto. Some other vestiges of very ancient paintings are to be  seen in the Confraternita de' Bianchi; in whose archives it is mentioned  that the picture of S. Biagio was repaired by Donato, in 1374; whence it  must necessarily be of a very early period. This and other interesting  information I obtained from Sig. Sebastiano"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#2)"],[1,"       = _H. microcephala underwoodi_      _Discussion._--The color pattern is the most useful character in  distinguishing the species of the _Hyla microcephala_ group from one  another. Except in _Hyla microcephala_, little geographic variation in  color pattern is noticeable. The features of color pattern that are  helpful in identifying the species are: 1) presence or absence of  lateral dark brown stripe; 2) longitudinal extent and width of lateral  stripe, if present; 3) presence or absence of a narrow white line just  dorsal to the lateral dark stripe; 4) presence or absence of an  interorbital dark mark; 5) the arrangement of dark markings on the  back, either as longitudinal lines or series of dashes, or in the form  of various kinds of transverse markings; 6) presence of dark flecks,  longitudinal line, or transverse marks on shanks.    Few consistent differences in measurements and proportions exist among  the species (Table 1). The most obvious morphological difference is  that the head is noticeably narrower in _H. robertmertensi_ than in  the other species. _Hyla phlebodes_ is the smallest species; adult  males attain snout-vent lengths of only 23.6 mm. The body is slender  in _H. microcephala_ and _robertmertensi_, slightly wider in  _phlebodes_, and noticeably broader in _sartori_.    _Distribution._--The composite range of the Middle American frogs of  the _Hyla microcephala_ group includes the lowlands of southern Mexico  and Central America, in some places to elevations of 1200 meters,  southeastward from southern Jalisco and southern Veracruz, excluding  arid regions (northern Yucatan Peninsula, Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin,  Plains of Tehuantepec, Grijalva Valley, Salama Basin, and upper  Motagua Valley) to the Pacific lowlands and the Cauca and Magdalena  valleys in Colombia.
