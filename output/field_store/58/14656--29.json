Chapter II - Adam and Eve faint when they leave the Garden.  God sends  His Word to encourage them.    1 But when our father Adam, and Eve, went out of the garden, they  walked the ground on their feet, not knowing they were walking.    2 And when they came to the opening of the gate of the garden, and saw  the broad earth spread before them, covered with stones large and  small, and with sand, they feared and trembled, and fell on their  faces, from the fear that came over them; and they were as dead.    3 Because--whereas until this time they had been in the garden land,  beautifully planted with all manner of trees--they now saw themselves,  in a strange land, which they knew not, and had never seen.    4 And because, when they were in the garden they were filled with the  grace of a bright nature, and they had not hearts turned toward earthly  things.    5 Therefore God had pity on them; and when He saw them fallen before  the gate of the garden, He sent His Word to our father, Adam and Eve,  and raised them from their fallen state.          Chapter III - Concerning the promise of the great five and a half days.      1 God said to Adam, \"I have ordained on this earth days and years, and  you and your descendants shall live and walk in them, until the days  and years are fulfilled; when I shall send the Word that created you,  and against which you have transgressed, the Word that made you come  out of the garden, and that raised you when you were fallen.    2 Yes, the Word that will again save you when the five and a half days  are fulfilled.\"    3 But when Adam heard these words from God, and of the great five and a  half days, he did not understand the meaning of them.    4 For Adam was thinking there would be only five and a half days for  him until the end of the world.    5 And Adam cried, and prayed to God to explain it to him.    6 Then God in his mercy for Adam who was made after His own image and  likeness, explained to him, that these were 5,000 and 500 years; and  how One would then come and save him and his descendants.    7 But before that, God had made this covenant with our father, Adam, in  the same terms, before he came out of the garden, when he was by the  tree where Eve took of the fruit and gave it to him to eat.    8 Because, when our father Adam came out of the garden, he passed by  that tree, and saw how God had changed the appearance of it into  another form, and how it shriveled.    9 And as Adam went to it he feared, trembled and fell down; but God in  His mercy lifted him up, and then made this covenant with him.    10 And again, when Adam was by the gate of the garden, and saw the  cherub with a sword of flashing fire in his hand, and the cherub grew  angry and frowned at him, both Adam and Eve became afraid of him, and  thought he meant to put them to death.  So they fell on their faces,  trembled with fear.    11 But he had pity on them, and showed them mercy; and turning from  them went up to heaven, and prayed to the Lord, and said;--    12 \"Lord, You sent me to watch at the gate of the garden, with a sword  of fire.    13 But when Your servants, Adam and Eve, saw me, they fell on their  faces, and were as dead.  O my Lord, what shall we do to Your servants?\"    14 Then God had pity on them, and showed them mercy, and sent His Angel  to keep the garden.    15 And the Word of the Lord came to Adam and Eve, and raised them up.    16 And the Lord said to Adam, \"I told you that at the end of the five  and a half days, I will send my Word and save you.    17 Strengthen your heart, therefore, and stay in the Cave of Treasures,  of which I have before spoken to you.\"    18 And when Adam heard this Word from God, he was comforted with that  which God had told him.  For He had told him how He would save him.          Chapter IV - Adam mourns over the changed conditions.  Adam and Eve  enter the Cave of Treasures.    1 But Adam and Eve cried for having come out of the garden, their first  home.    2 And indeed, when Adam looked at his flesh, that was altered, he cried  bitterly, he and Eve, over what they had done.  And they walked and  went gently down into the Cave of Treasures.    3 And as they came to it, Adam cried over himself and said to Eve,  \"Look at this cave  that is to  be our prison in this world, and a  place of punishment!    4 What is it compared with the garden?  What is its narrowness compared  with the space of the other?    5 What is this rock, by the side of those groves?  What is the gloom of  this cavern, compared with the light of the garden?    6 What is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us, compared with  the mercy of the Lord that overshadowed us?    7 What is the soil of this cave compared with the garden land?  This  earth, strewed with stones; and that, planted with delicious fruit  trees?\"    8 And Adam said to Eve, \"Look at your eyes, and at mine, which before  beheld angels praising in heaven; and they too, without ceasing.    9 But now we do not see as we did; our eyes have become of flesh; they  cannot see like they used to see before.\"    10 Adam said again to Eve, \"What is our body today, compared to what it  was in former days, when we lived in the garden?\"    11 After this, Adam did not want to enter the cave, under the  overhanging rock; nor would he ever want to enter it.    12 But he bowed to God's orders; and said to himself, \"Unless I enter  the cave, I shall again be a transgressor.\"          Chapter V - Eve makes a noble and emotional intercession, taking the  blame on herself.    1 Then Adam and Eve entered the cave, and stood praying, in their own  tongue, unknown to us, but which they knew well.    2 And as they prayed, Adam raised his eyes and saw the rock and the  roof of the cave that covered him overhead.  This prevented him from  seeing either heaven or God's creatures.  So he cried and beat his  chest hard, until he dropped, and was as dead.    3 And Eve sat crying; for she believed he was dead.    4 Then she got up, spread her hands toward God, appealing to Him for  mercy and pity, and said, \"O God, forgive me my sin, the sin which I  committed, and don't remember it against me.    5 For I alone caused Your servant to fall from the garden into this  condemned land; from light into this darkness; and from the house of  joy into this prison.    6 O God, look at this Your servant fallen in this manner, and bring him  back to life, that he may cry and repent of his transgression which he  committed through me.    7 Don't take away his soul right now; but let him live that he may  stand after the measure of his repentance, and do Your will, as before  his death.    8 But if You do not bring him back to life, then, O God, take away my  own soul, that I be like him, and leave me not in this dungeon, one and  alone; for I could not stand alone in this world, but with him only.    9 For You, O God, caused him to fall asleep, and took a bone from his  side, and restored the flesh  in the place of it, by Your divine power.    10 And You took me, the bone, and make me a woman, bright like him,  with heart, reason, and speech; and in flesh, like to his own; and You  made me after the likeness of his looks, by Your mercy and power.    11 O Lord, I and he are one, and You, O God, are our Creator, You are  He who made us both in one day.    12 Therefore, O God, give him life, that he may be with me in this  strange land, while we live in it on account of our transgression.    13 But if You will not give him life, then take me, even me, like him;  that we both may die the same day.\"    14 And Eve cried bitterly, and fell on our father Adam; from her great  sorrow.          Chapter VI - God's reprimand to Adam and Eve in which he points out how  and why they sinned.    1 But God looked at them; for they had killed themselves through great  grief.    2 But He decided to raise them and comfort them.    3 He, therefore, sent His Word to them; that they should stand and be  raised immediately.    4 And the Lord said to Adam and Eve, \"You transgressed of your own free  will, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.    5 Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for  divinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I  deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made  you come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.    6 If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law,  and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree which I told you not to come  near!  And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.    7 But the wicked Satan did not keep his faith and had no good intent  towards Me, that although I had created him, he considered Me to be  useless, and sought the Godhead for himself; for this I hurled him down  from heaven so that he could not remain in his first estate--it was he  who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by  believing his words.    8 Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore I have  brought on you all these sorrows.    9 For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not  intend to destroy them.  But after they had sorely roused My anger, I  punished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.    10 But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their  transgression, they shall be under a curse forever.\"          Chapter VII - The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#2)"],[1,"latest editions have been supplied       with some very valuable notices, (drawn also from MSS.) by       the Ab. Bianconi, already commended by us, and by Sig.       Marcello Oretti, a very diligent collector of pictoric       anecdotes, as well as by other persons. I cite this work       under the title of the _Guide_ of Bologna; in addition to       which I mention in Romagna that of Ravenna by Beltrami, that       of Rimini by Costa, and of Pesaro by Becci, which is farther       illustrated by observations upon the chief paintings at       Pesaro, and a dissertation upon the art; both very ably       treated by the pen of Sig. Canon. Lazzarini.                           BOLOGNESE SCHOOL.                               EPOCH I.                     _The Ancients._      The new Guide of Bologna, published in the year 1782, directs our attention  to a number of figures, in particular those of the Virgin, which, on the  strength of ancient documents, are to be assigned to ages anterior to the  twelfth century. Of some of these we find the authors' names indicated; and  it forms, perhaps, the peculiar boast of Bologna to claim three of them  during the twelfth century: one Guido, one Ventura, and one Ursone, of whom  there exist memorials as late back as 1248. Most part, however, are from  unknown hands, and so well executed, that we are justified in suspecting  that they must have been retouched about the times of Lippo Dalmasio, to  whose style a few of them bear considerable resemblance. Yet not so with  others; more especially a specimen in San Pietro, which I consider to be  one of the most ancient preserved in Italy. But the finest monument of  painting possessed by Bologna, at once the most unique and untouched, is  the _Catino_ of San Stefano, on which is figured the Adoration of the Lamb  of God, described in the Apocalypse; and below this are several scriptural  histories; as the Birth of our Lord, his Epiphany, the Dispute, and similar  subjects. The author was either Greek, or rather a scholar of those Greeks  who ornamented the church of St. Mark in Venice with their mosaics; the  manner much resembling theirs in its rude design, the spareness of the  limbs, and in the distribution of the colours. It is besides, certain, that  these Greeks educated several artists for Italy, and among others the  founder of the Ferrarese School, of whom more in its appropriate place.  However this may be, the painter exhibits traces that differ from those  mosaic workers, such as the flow of the beard, the shape of the garments,  and a taste less bent on thronging his compositions. And in respect to his  age, it is apparent it must have been between the twelfth and thirteenth  centuries, from the form of the characters, collated with other writings  belonging to the same period.    Entering upon the age of Giotto, the most disputed of all, on account of  the Florentines having declared themselves the tutors of the Bolognese, and  the aversion of the latter to admit that they have been instructed by the  Florentines;--I decline to dwell upon their writings, in which the heat of  controversy has effectually obscured the candour of real history. I shall  rather gather light from the figures of the _trecentisti_ dispersed  throughout the city and all parts of Romagna, and from the ample  collections which are to be seen in various places. Such is that of the  Padri Classensi at Ravenna, that of the Institute at Bologna, and in the  same place one at the Malvezzi palace, where the pictures of the ancient  masters are exhibited in long series, with their names; not always  inscribed, indeed, in ancient character, nor always equally genuine; but  still calculated to reflect honour upon the noble family that made the  collection. In all these I discovered paintings, some manifestly Greek;  some indisputably Giottesque; certain others of Venetian style; and not a  few in a manner which I never saw, except in Bologna. They possess a body  of colouring, a taste in perspective, a method of designing and draping the  figures, not met with in any other cities; as for instance, in several  places I saw scripture histories, where the Redeemer invariably appears  arrayed in a red mantle; while other characters appear in garments trimmed  in a certain novel style with gilt borders; trifles in themselves, yet not  apparent in any other school. From similar observations we seem to be  justified in concluding that the Bolognese of that age likewise had a  school of their own, not indeed so elegant, nor so celebrated, but  nevertheless peculiar, and so to say, municipal, derived from ancient  masters of mosaic, and also from those in miniature.    On this head, notwithstanding our proposed brevity, I must here refer to  the words of Baldinucci in his notices of the miniature painter, Franco:  \"After Giotto, that very celebrated Florentine painter, had discovered his  novel and fine method by which he gained the name of the first restorer of  the art of painting, or rather to have raised it from utter extinction; and  after he had acquired with industrious diligence that fine mode of painting  which is called _di minio_,[2] which for the most part consists in  colouring very diminutive figures; many others also applied themselves to  the like art, and soon became illustrious. One of these was Oderigi  d'Agubbio, concerning whom we have spoken in his proper place among the  disciples of Cimabue. We discovered that this Oderigi, as we are assured by  Vellutello in his comment upon Dante, in the eleventh canto of the  Purgatorio,[3] was master in the art to Franco Bolognese, which assertion  acquires great credit from his having worked much in miniature in the city  of Bologna, according to these words that I find said of him by Benvenuto  da Imola, a contemporary of Petrarch, in his comment upon Dante: 'Iste  Odorisius fuit magnus miniator in civitate Bononiae, qui erat valde vanus  jactator artis suae.' From this Franco, according to the opinion of  Malvasia, the most noble and ever glorious city of Bologna received the  first seeds of the beautiful art of painting.\"         Footnote 2: _Di minio_, a peculiar red colour, used also in       oil painting, and well known to the ancients, who on festal       days were accustomed to ornament with it the face of Jove's       statue, as also that of the victors on days of triumph.       Pliny and others explain the ancient method of employing it.       The term, in its simple acceptation, means here the art of       designing and colouring in miniature, (from _di minio_)       early applied to the ornamenting and illuminating of ancient       works and MSS. R.         Footnote 3:           \"Oh dissi lui non se' tu Oderisi,           L'onor d'Agubbio, e l'onor di quell'arte           Che alluminar e chiamata a Parisi?         Frate, diss'egli, piu ridon le carte           Che pennellegia Franco Bolognese:           L'onor e tutto or suo, e mio in parte.         Ben non sarei stato si cortese           Mentre ch'io vissi per lo gran disio           Dell'eccellenza, ove mio cor intese.         Di tal superbia qui si paga il fio.\"    With this narrative does the author proceed, like a careful culturist,  gently sprinkling with refreshing drops his pictoric tree, whose seed he  had shortly before planted, in order to trace the whole derivation of early  artists from the leading stock of Cimabue. It has elsewhere been observed  that this famous tree can boast no root in history; that it sprung out of  idle conjectures, put together as an answer to the _Felsina Pittrice_ of  Malvasia, in which the Bolognese School is made to appear, as it were,  _autoctona_, derived only from itself. Now Baldinucci, in order to give its  origin to Florence, would persuade us that Oderigi, a miniaturist, and  master of Franco, the first painter at Bologna on the revival of the arts,  had actually been a disciple of Cimabue. His argument amounts to this: that  Dante, Giotto, and Oderigi, being known to have lived on the most intimate  terms together, and all three greatly devoted to the fine arts, must have  contracted their friendship in the school of Cimabue; as if such an  intimacy might not have sprung up at any other time or place amongst three  men who travelled. It is besides difficult to believe that Oderigi,  ambitious of the fame of a miniaturist in ornamenting books, should have  applied to Cimabue, who in those times was not the best designer of  figures, though the most eminent painter in fresco, and of grand figures.    A more probable supposition, therefore, is that Oderigi acquired the art  from the miniaturists, who then greatly abounded in Italy, and carried it  to further perfection by his own design. Neither are the epochs themselves,  fixed upon by Baldinucci, in favour of his system. He would have it that  Giotto, at ten years of age, being about the year 1286, began to design in  the school of Cimabue, when the latter had attained his forty-sixth year;  nor could Oderigi have been any younger, whose death happened about 1299,  one year before that of Cimabue, his equal in reputation, and in the  dignity of the pupil, who already surpassed the master. How difficult then  to persuade ourselves that a genius, described by Dante as lofty and full  of vaunting, should demean himself by deigning to design at the school of a  contemporary, near the seat of a mere child; and subsequently surviving  only thirteen years, should acquire the fame of the first miniaturist of  his age, besides forming the mind of a pupil superior to himself. It is no  less incredible that Oderigi, after having seen Giotto's specimens in  miniature, \"_should in a short time become famous_.\" Giotto, in 1298, when  twenty-two years of age, was at Rome in the service of the pope; where,  observes Baldinucci, he also illuminated a book for the Car. Stefaneschi; a  circumstance not mentioned by Vasari, nor supported by any"]]]
