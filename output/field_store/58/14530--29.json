The offerings of Lampson and Nesbitt is short of a year ago with the  exceptions of beaver, muskrat and skunk. The advanced price of muskrat,  no doubt, caused more trapping of these animals than ever before. Again  the fact of the dry fall in many localities bunched the rats, so that  they were much easier caught. The rats offered at the recent sales are  largely fall and winter. From reports, the collection of spring rats  will be very light--in many localities not more than one-fourth of an  average collection.    While the offerings now show some 200,000 in excess of March, 1908, and  also March, 1907, indications are that before the year 1909 ends there  will be a shortage in the total rat catch for the year. Considerable  anxiety is felt regarding skunk, as the number offered was 545,280  compared with 416,000 in March, 1908, which is nearly 130,000 more. This  is hardly a fair test. The offerings at March Sales 1908 were light from  the fact that skunk were not in demand at the beginning of the fall  season of 1907, when a good per cent. of skunk are caught for the  following March Sales. Go back another year, that is March, 1907, and  see what the offerings of skunk were; you perhaps will be surprised to  learn that it was 615,900 or 70,000 more than at this spring's sale. The  offerings of beaver were larger than a year ago, but with these  exceptions, there appears a decided falling off--note the quantity of  fox, coon, marten, lynx--all much less.    Furs are fashionable throughout the entire civilized world, and the  catch seems inadequate on many articles. This is probably responsible  for the high prices. At any rate, some articles have advanced beyond all  previous high record. Prices for wolf, fox, lynx, wild cat and muskrat  are very high, as well as many other American raw furs. Skunk reached a  price that no one expected the past season. Since early in March or  shortly after, too late to get goods into the London Sales, prices were  lowered on skunk, opossum, raccoon and some grades of mink, especially  Southern and Southwestern, but at the same time it should be taken into  consideration that the quality is not so desirable as during the  midwinter months.    Many believe that by far the most of the furs come from the Far North.  This is erroneous. It is true that the most valuable furs, such as  silver, black and cross foxes, lynx and marten, come from that section.  Some of the best otter, red fox and mink are also secured in the far  northern country. Yet fully one-half of the value of the American catch  of raw furs is comprised in the three following articles--skunk, mink  and muskrat.    In the Far North there will be foxes, otter, mink, and marten for some  time to come. But what about that part of the country, say south of the  Great Lakes, west of the Allegheny Mountains, north of the Tennessee and  Arkansas Rivers and east of the Rocky Mountains?--a section which has  been producing about half of the furs.    This section is the great skunk producing one and as well as one of the  best mink and muskrat sections. It also furnishes from the Southern  States within the area outlined, great quantities of coon and opossum.  When those interested in the fur business consider that half the value  of the annual catch is skunk, mink, and muskrat and that the best  producing section has hitherto been the section as outlined, one can  easily see that the supply will not long be equal to the demand.    During recent years, owing to persistent trapping, the fur producers  have been greatly reduced and if not practically exterminated in parts  of the country, are destined to become nearly so. The fact that skunk,  mink and muskrat have been so greatly reduced in the past few years has  caused those interested in the fur industry to ask,--\"what of the  future?\" with the settlement of the country and the draining of the  swamps, clearing of the forests, etc., which deprives many species of  fur producers of their natural homes, how can it be expected that the  supply will last?    That skunk, mink and muskrat do well in settled sections, there is no  question, but since their pelts are so valuable, more trappers are after  them than ever before. In addition, magazines and books on the subject  are more plentiful than in former years, so that the inexperienced  hunter and trapper has far better success than in past years.    There is always a cash market for raw furs and since the discovery of  America, raw furs have been an important article of commerce. In the  early days, beaver was the leading article and even at this date  thousands of skins are secured annually by the professional trapper in  the swamps of the south and along the streams and lakes of the north.  Scattered thruout the South, Rocky Mountain sections, Northern Canada  and parts of the East, are several thousand professional hunters and  trappers whose annual catch amounts to several hundred dollars each. The  aggregate of these men, footing up to perhaps $3,000,000 or $4,000,000.  In the settled sections are tens of thousands of boys and amateur  trappers with here and there a professional. The annual catch of these  foot up to perhaps $6,000,000 to $8,000,000, or double the catch of the  professionals who leave civilization in September and are not seen again  until May or June.    It is this class (boys and amateurs) that secures the greatest  quantities of fur and as the number of trappers is so large and the  grounds necessarily limited, here is where the animals are rapidly  decreasing and at the present rate are in danger of extermination. In  some sections there has been a wonderful falling off in the catch of  late years, altho the number of trappers is larger.    An industry paying the hunter and trapper probably $15,000,000 yearly is  one that should receive attention. At the present rate of extermination,  some of the fur bearers are destined to soon follow in the wake of the  buffalo. The demand for furs is increasing as the population of the  world is becoming more and more. Again furs are being put to more uses  than ever. While the demand for furs are increasing, what of the supply?  The day, perhaps, is not far in the distance when the demand will call  for two or three times as many furs as today. Where are they to come  from? The natural supply is surely diminishing.    The matter of 'Supply and Demand' is one that there is considerable  difference of opinion upon. Hunters and trappers, as a rule, are of one  opinion and that is that the number of pelts secured upon a certain  territory is becoming less each year. Trappers going over their lines  are surely the ones who know whether the fur is holding out or not.    The number of persons seeking fur is larger each year. In localities  furnishing as much fur as ever, the chances are that the number of  animals left for breeding is less each year. If such is true the day  when these localities will show a falling off in the receipts is not far  in the distance.    Until recently, many dealers and manufacturers believed that the supply  of wild fur-bearing animals was practically inexhaustible--that when  wanted, trappers would go out into the \"wilds,\" catch, skin and send the  pelts to market. These people are beginning to awaken to the true  situation and while they send out price lists, circulars, and traveling  buyers after raw furs, they say it is much harder to secure the goods  wanted than formerly.    A well known dealer in Minneapolis in sizing up the situation, says:  \"With the vast fund of information about trapping being sent out and  with improved traps for catching and the great stimulus to trapping  owing to high prices, in five to ten years, there will not be one-fourth  to one-half the fur bearers that there are now, unless stringent laws  are enacted to curtail the trapping.\"    \"Under proper conditions, with intelligent care, no doubt, raising fur  animals can be made to pay. The raiser starting on a small scale and  increasing as their knowledge increases. Most all successful business is  built up by starting small.\"    The dealer who wrote the above advertises quite extensively for furs.  The territory tributary to that city has always been considered a good  fur producing one. During recent years, the supply has fallen off  materially in face of the fact of improved trapping methods and a  greatly increased number of persons seeking the fur bearers. The same  conditions are true to a greater or less degree in many parts of the  country.    The American people, however, can be depended upon to meet all  emergencies. They have already set about to provide for the future raw  fur supply by raising the animals. As early as 1884, experiments were  made at raising foxes on the islands in the Northern Pacific Ocean,  along the coast of British Columbia and Alaska. The experiments, as a  rule, proved successful and there has been for years a number of  successful fox raisers on the islands of the North Pacific. More will be  said about them elsewhere.    In various parts of North America, experiments have been made,  principally with skunk, altho a few have tried mink and other animals  but only in a small way, or by men who expected to get rich quick and  who did not give the enterprise the care and attention that is necessary  to make a success at any business.          CHAPTER II.    WHAT ANIMALS TO RAISE.      There is a bright future to \"Fur Farming.\" The person who knows  something of the habits of the animal or animals that they expect to  raise, will be the successful ones.

In that case,  her choice might have appeared as the result of personal experience of some  peculiar benefit or pleasure derived from the plant, and then this  sentiment might have become hereditary; just as, for example, the acquired  taste for game is hereditary with sporting dogs. Whereas the fact is, that  a butterfly only occasionally, and as a matter of accident rather than  rule, derives her own nectareous food from the flowers of the plant, whose  leaves nourish her caterpillar progeny. So that this, as well as numberless  other phenomena of instinct, remains a mystery to be admired, but not  explained by any ordinary rule of cause and effect.    Having thus efficiently provided, as far as board and lodging are  concerned, for the welfare of the future brood, the mother seems to  consider them settled for life, takes no further care of them, nor even  awaits the opening of the sculptured caskets that contain their tiny  life-germs; but, trusting them to the sun's warmth for their hatching, and  then to their own hungry little instincts to teach them good use of the  food placed within their reach, she sees them no more.    But though abandoning her offspring to fate in this manner, it must not be  imagined that the butterfly mother takes her pattern of maternity from  certain {6} human mothers, and in a round of \"butterfly's balls,\" and such  like dissipations, forgets the sacred claims of the nursery. No, she has  far other and better excuses for absenting herself from her family; one of  which is, that she usually dies before the latter are hatched; and if that  is not enough, that the young can get on quite as well without her; for  probably she could not teach them much about caterpillar economics, unless,  indeed, she remembered her own infantile habits of lang syne, so totally  different from those of her perfected butterfly life.    The space of time passed in the egg state varies much according to the  temperature--from a few days when laid in genial summer weather, to several  months in the case of those laid in the autumn, and which remain quiescent  during the winter, to hatch out in the spring.    The eggs of butterflies, in common with those of insects in general, are  capable of resisting not only vicissitudes, but extremes of temperature  that would be surely destructive of life in most other forms. The severest  cold of an English winter will not kill the tender butterfly eggs, whose  small internal spark of vitality is enough to keep them from freezing under  a much greater degree of cold than they are ever subjected to in a state of  nature. For example, they have been placed in an artificial freezing  mixture, which brought down the thermometer to 22deg below zero--a deadly  chill--and yet they survived with apparent {7} impunity, and afterwards  lived to hatch duly. Then as to their heat-resisting powers, some tropical  insects habitually lay their eggs in sandy, sun-scorched places, where the  hand cannot endure to remain a few moments; the heat rising daily to  somewhere about 190deg of the thermometer--and we know what a roasting one  gets at 90deg or so. Yet they thrive through all this.    For a short time previous to hatching, the form and colour of the  caterpillar is faintly discoverable through the semi-transparent egg-shell.  The juvenile CATERPILLAR, or LARVA, gnaws his way through the shell into  the world, and makes his appearance in the shape of a slender worm,  exceedingly minute of course, and bearing few of the distinctive marks of  his species, either as to shape or colouring. On finding himself at  liberty, in the midst of plentiful good cheer, he at once falls vigorously  to work at the great business of his life--_eating_; often making his first  meal--oddly enough--off the egg-shell, lately his cradle. This singular  relish, or digestive pill, swallowed, he addresses himself to the food that  is to form the staple fare during the whole of his caterpillar  existence--viz. the leaves of his food-plant, which at the same time is his  home-plant too.    At this stage his growth is marvellously rapid, and few creatures can equal  him in the capacity for doubling his weight--not even the starved  lodging-house \"slavey,\" when she gets to her new place, with _carte  blanche_ allowance and the key of the pantry; for, in the course {8} of  twenty-four hours, he will have consumed more than twice his own weight of  food: and with such persevering avidity does he ply his pleasant task,  that, as it is stated, a caterpillar in the course of one month has  increased nearly ten thousand times his original weight on leaving the egg;  and, to furnish this increase of substance, has consumed the prodigious  quantity of forty thousand times his weight of food--truly, a ruinous rate  of living, only that green leaves are so cheap.    But the life of a caterpillar, after all, is not merely the smooth  continual feast he would doubtless prefer it to be; it is interrupted,  several times in its course, by the necessity nature has imposed upon him  of now and then changing his coat--to him a very troublesome, if not a  painful affair.    For some time previous to this phenomenon, even eating is nearly or quite  suspended,--the caterpillar becomes sluggish and shy, creeping away into  some more secluded spot, and there remaining till his time of trouble is  over. Various twitchings and contortions of the body now testify to the  _mal-aise_ of the creature in his old coat, which, though formed of a  material capable of a moderate amount of stretching, soon becomes outgrown,  and most uncomfortably tight-fitting, with such a quick-growing person  inside it: so off it must come, but it being unprovided with buttons,  there's the rub. However, with a great deal of fidgeting and  shoulder-shrugging, he manages to tear his coat down the back, and lastly,  by patient efforts, shuffles off the old rag; {9} when, lo! underneath is a  lustrous new garment, somewhat similar, but not exactly a copy of the last,  for our beau has his peculiar dress for each epoch of his life,--the most  splendid being often reserved for the last.    This change of dress (\"_moulting_,\" it is sometimes called) is repeated  thrice at least in the creature's life, but more generally five or six  times. Not only does the outer husk come off at these times, but, wonderful  to relate! the lining membrane of all the digestive passages, and of the  larger breathing tubes, is cast off and renewed also.    After each moult, the caterpillar makes up for his loss of time by eating  more voraciously even than before, in many instances breaking his fast by  making a meal of his \"old clo'\"--an odd taste, first evinced, as we have  seen, in earliest infancy, when he swallowed his cradle.    On Plate I. are shown the chief varieties of form taken by the caterpillars  of our British butterflies, and a glance at these will give, better than  verbal descriptions, a general idea of their characteristics.    Their most usual shape is elongated and almost cylindrical, or slightly  tapering at one or both ends. Of these, some are smooth, or only studded  with short down or hairs; such are the caterpillars of the Swallow-tail  butterfly (fig. 1), of the Brimstone (fig. 2), Clouded Yellows, and Garden,  and other white butterflies. Others, of the same _general_ form, are beset  with long branched spines, making perfect _chevaux-de-frise_; such {10} are  those of the Peacock, Red Admiral, Painted Lady, and the Silvery  Fritillaries.    The caterpillars of another large section have the body considerably  thicker in the middle (rolling-pin shaped), and the tail part two-forked,  or _bifurcate_. This form belongs to the numerous family that includes the  Meadow-brown (fig. 3), the Ringlets, and many others.    The _bizarre_ personage, at fig. 4, turns to the graceful White Admiral  butterfly.    The Purple Emperor begins his royal career in the curious form shown at  fig. 5--a shape unique among British butterflies, as beseems that of their  sovereign; and he carries a coronet on his brow already.    All those beautiful little butterflies called the Hair-streaks (fig. 9),  the Blues (fig. 10), and the Coppers, have very short and fat caterpillars,  that remind one forcibly of wood-lice--a shape shared also by that small  butterfly with a big name, the Duke of Burgundy Fritillary (fig. 8), an  insect very distinct from the Fritillaries above mentioned with thorny  caterpillars.    The _legs of a caterpillar are usually sixteen in number_, and composed of  two distinct kinds, viz. of _six true legs_, answering to those of the  perfect insect, and placed on the foremost segments of the body; and of  _ten_ others, called \"_prolegs_;\" temporary legs, used principally for  strengthening the creature's hold upon leaf or branch.    Like the rest of its body, the caterpillar's head widely {11} differs in  structure from that of the perfect insect, being furnished with a pair of  jaws, horny and strong, befitting the heavy work they have to get through,  and shaped like pincers, opening and shutting from side to side, instead of  working up and down after the manner of the jaws in vertebrate animals.  This arrangement offers great convenience to the creature, feeding, as it  is wont to do, on the thin edge of a leaf. It is a curious sight to watch a  caterpillar thus engaged. Adhering by his close-clinging prolegs, and  guiding the edge of the leaf between his forelegs, he stretches out his  head as far as he can reach, and commences a series of rapid bites, at each  nibble bringing the head nearer the legs, till they almost meet; then  stretching out again the same regular set of mouthfuls is abstracted, and  so on, repeating the process till a large semi-circular indentation is  formed, reaching perhaps to the midrib of the leaf; then shifting his  position to a new vantage ground, the marauder recommences operations,  another sweep is"]]]
