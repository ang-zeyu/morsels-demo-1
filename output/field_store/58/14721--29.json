In addition to what I learned from the Quakers I received about  the same time, also from America, some information on the subject  from a source perfectly distinct and previously unknown to me.    The son of William Lloyd Garrison, the famous champion of the  emancipation of the negroes, wrote to me that he had read my book, in  which he found ideas similar to those expressed by his father in the  year 1838, and that, thinking it would be interesting to me to know  this, he sent me a declaration or proclamation of \"non-resistance\" drawn  up by his father nearly fifty years ago.    This declaration came about under the following circumstances:  William Lloyd Garrison took part in a discussion on the means of  suppressing war in the Society for the Establishment of Peace  among Men, which existed in 1838 in America.  He came to the  conclusion that the establishment of universal peace can only be  founded on the open profession of the doctrine of non-resistance  to evil by violence (Matt. v. 39), in its full significance, as  understood by the Quakers, with whom Garrison happened to be on  friendly relations. Having come to this conclusion, Garrison  thereupon composed and laid before the society a declaration,  which was signed at the time--in 1838--by many members.       \"DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS ADOPTED BY PEACE CONVENTION.     \"Boston, 1838.       \"We the undersigned, regard it as due to ourselves, to the     cause which we love, to the country in which we live, to     publish a declaration expressive of the purposes we aim to     accomplish and the measures we shall adopt to carry forward the     work of peaceful universal reformation.       \"We do not acknowledge allegiance to any human government.  We     recognize but one King and Lawgiver, one Judge and Ruler of     mankind.  Our country is the world, our countrymen are all     mankind.  We love the land of our nativity only as we love all     other lands.  The interests and rights of American citizens are     not dearer to us than those of the whole human race.  Hence we     can allow no appeal to patriotism to revenge any national     insult or injury...       \"We conceive that a nation has no right to defend itself     against foreign enemies or to punish its invaders, and no     individual possesses that right in his own case, and the unit     cannot be of greater importance than the aggregate.  If     soldiers thronging from abroad with intent to commit rapine and     destroy life may not be resisted by the people or the     magistracy, then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic     troublers of the public peace or of private security.       \"The dogma that all the governments of the world are     approvingly ordained of God, and that the powers that be in the     United States, in Russia, in Turkey, are in accordance with his     will, is no less absurd than impious.  It makes the impartial     Author of our existence unequal and tyrannical. It cannot be     affirmed that the powers that be in any nation are actuated by     the spirit or guided by the example of Christ in the treatment     of enemies; therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of     God, and therefore their overthrow by a spiritual regeneration     of their subjects is inevitable.       \"We regard as unchristian and unlawful not only all wars,     whether offensive or defensive, but all preparations for war;     every naval ship, every arsenal, every fortification, we regard     as unchristian and unlawful; the existence of any kind of      standing army, all military chieftains, all monuments     commemorative of victory over a fallen foe, all trophies won in     battle, all celebrations in honor of military exploits, all     appropriations for defense by arms; we regard as unchristian     and unlawful every edict of government requiring of its     subjects military service.       \"Hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms, and we cannot hold any     office which imposes on its incumbent the obligation to compel     men to do right on pain of imprisonment or death.  We therefore     voluntarily exclude ourselves from every legislative and     judicial body, and repudiate all human politics, worldly     honors, and stations of authority.  If we cannot occupy a seat     in the legislature or on the bench, neither can we elect others     to act as our substitutes in any such capacity.  It follows     that we cannot sue any man at law to force him to return     anything he may have wrongly taken from us; if he has seized     our coat, we shall surrender him our cloak also rather than     subject him to punishment.       \"We believe that the penal code of the old covenant--an eye for     an eye, and a tooth for a tooth--has been abrogated by Jesus     Christ, and that under the new covenant the forgiveness instead     of the punishment of enemies has been enjoined on all his     disciples in all cases whatsoever.  To extort money from     enemies, cast them into prison, exile or execute them, is     obviously not to forgive but to take retribution.       \"The history of mankind is crowded with evidences proving that     physical coercion is not adapted to moral regeneration, and     that the sinful dispositions of men can be subdued only by     love; that evil can be exterminated only by good; that it is     not safe to rely upon the strength of an arm to preserve us     from harm; that there is great security in being gentle,     long-suffering, and abundant in mercy; that it is only the meek     who shall inherit the earth; for those who take up the sword     shall perish by the sword.       \"Hence as a measure of sound policy--of safety to property,     life, and liberty--of public quietude and private enjoyment--as     well as on the ground of allegiance to Him who is King of kings     and Lord of lords, we cordially adopt the non-resistance     principle, being confident that it provides for all possible     consequences, is armed with omnipotent power, and must     ultimately triumph over every assailing force.       \"We advocate no Jacobinical doctrines.  The spirit of     Jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation, violence, and murder.     It neither fears God nor regards man.  We would be filled with     the spirit of Christ.  If we abide evil by our fundamental     principle of not opposing evil by evil we cannot participate in     sedition, treason, or violence.  We shall submit to every     ordinance and every requirement of government, except such as     are contrary to the commands of the Gospel, and in no case     resist the operation of law, except by meekly submitting to the     penalty of disobedience.       \"But while we shall adhere to the doctrine of non-resistance     and passive submission to enemies, we purpose, in a moral and     spiritual sense, to assail iniquity in high places and in low     places, to apply our principles to all existing evil,     political, legal, and ecclesiastical institutions, and to     hasten the time when the kingdoms of this world will have     become the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It appears to us     a self-evident truth that whatever the Gospel is designed to     destroy at any period of the world, being contrary to it, ought     now to be abandoned.  If, then, the time is predicted when     swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning     hooks, and men shall not learn the art of war any more, it     follows that all who manufacture, sell, or wield these deadly     weapons do thus array themselves against the peaceful dominion     of the Son of God on earth.       \"Having thus stated our principles, we proceed to specify the     measures we propose to adopt in carrying our object into     effect.       \"We expect to prevail through the Foolishness of Preaching.  We     shall endeavor to promulgate our views among all persons, to     whatever nation, sect, or grade of society they may belong.     Hence we shall organize public lectures, circulate tracts and     publications, form societies, and petition every governing     body.  It will be our leading object to devise ways and means     for effecting a radical change in the views, feelings, and     practices of society respecting the sinfulness of war and the     treatment of enemies.       \"In entering upon the great work before us, we are not     unmindful that in its prosecution we may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#2)"],[1,"              \"       81      THE TOWERS OF SAN GIMIGNANO                               \"       89      CHIUSURE FROM MONTE OLIVETO MAGGIORE                      \"      107      CITTA DELLA PIEVE FROM CHIUSI                             \"      118      ETRUSCAN CINERARY URNS                                    \"      122      CHIMNEYS AT PASSIGNANO                                    \"      133      ASSISI: S.

It had been a  breathless day. Even at Genoa the air hung heavy with the sirocco.  We found Pisa in a mirage, and the white hills of Carrara  glistening like the lime rocks of a desert.    It was good to be in Tuscany again--Tuscany with her grey farms  and lichened roofs, her towered horizons, her blue hills, her  vineyards, and her olive-gardens. We could hear the song of the  cicalas vibrating in the sunshine above the jar of the train; near  at hand the hills swelled up, clothed with the tender mist of  olives or linked with vines; stone-pines floated darkly against the  sky, and cypress spires climbed the hillsides in a long procession  like souls on pilgrimage.    Perhaps it is because Arezzo, little Arezzo, with her ancient  history and her tale of great men, was the earliest of our  hill-cities that we loved her at first sight. Coming from London  and Genoa, with the noise and dust and heat of long train journeys  still hanging about us, she seemed very cool and sweet among her  vineyards and olive-gardens. She has left her hill-top now that  she needs no more the walls which Sangallo built in the fighting  days of the Popes, and has trailed down to the railway in the  valley, leaving behind her wide piazzas which she has filled with  shady trees, and benches, and statues of her great ones. Her paved  streets, steep and clean, climb up the hillside between grey  palaces, green-shuttered, with wide Tuscan eaves, whose fantastic  outlines, seen in echelon against the sky, bring back a score of  memories of other clean-swept Tuscan towns.    Now that we were threading her byways, Arezzo, though she had  looked imposing from the valley, dwindled to a little brown city,  full of memories, and frescoed churches, and ancient houses in  which the labourer dwells in his poverty to-day where the rich  citizens of Arezzo once held great state. Capers and all manner of  pensive creepers grew out of the rough walls; fig-trees, roses,  wistarias, and oleanders in full blossom poured over them, so that  the air was full of fragrance. And there were flowers in the upper  windows of thirteenth-century houses, for your Tuscan is fond  of flowers, and will have his _garofani_ upon his window-ledge.  Through the low-browed gateways we could see women spinning in  arcaded courtyards; and the shoemakers and basket-weavers worked  at their humble trades as they sat on the steps of weather-beaten  Gothic houses.    And often as we wandered through her narrow streets we paused  to look down upon the calm beauty of the Tuscan plain, which  stretched from the vineyards below her walls to the blue mountains  of Chianti. Nor did it require any effort of imagination, while we  were walking in those mediaeval byways between the Borgunto and  the Via di Pellicceria, to people the rich valley with the pageant  which Dante witnessed while he was staying in Arezzo with the elder  Petrarch, both exiles from Florence.      'It hath been heretofore my chance to see    Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,    To onset sallying, or in muster rang'd,    Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight;    Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers    Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,    And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,    Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,    Tabors, or signals made from castled heights.'[1]    A common sight enough, heaven knows, in the Middle Ages, when every  little city sought to rule itself, and the populace and the petty  lords alike cloaked their ambitions under the old war-cry of Guelph  and Ghibelline!    There is an air of gaiety in Arezzo, a simple, almost pastoral,  joy. The philosopher felt it at once.    'We are like flowers,' he said, as we sat on a bench outside the  inn after our first breakfast in Tuscany. 'In London our roots  spread in the ground, and they get knotted and twisted in the  darkness. Here we shoot right up into the sun.'    And, indeed, Arezzo is a happy place, whose charm, it may be,  owes its origin to an earlier civilisation, which has left so  many broken fragments of its art scattered on the neighbouring  hillsides. They are garnered to-day in the museum among the  relics of Arezzo's history, of which they are the chief glory now  that the bronze Chimera and the magnificent Etruscan statue of  Minerva have gone to swell the treasures of Florence. There is not  a vase or _patera_ unbroken. The entire collection is composed  of fragments, moulds and casts in low relief. But every piece is  exquisitely beautiful; each one is like a shell cast by the tides  of fantasy upon the shores of a work-a-day world. And though the  streets of Arezzo are nearly always empty and silent, I think the  flutes and lyres and dancing fauns, with which the artists of  Arretium delicately graced their coral-coloured bowls and cups,  are not silenced yet upon this Tuscan hill. Perhaps the spirit of  the slim-limbed girls and youths, and merry little loves, whose  forms are beauty, and whose fragile feet seem scarce to bruise the  ground, dance still to their forgotten songs about the vineyards  of Arretium. It is as though the dream of some Attic poet, for I  cannot think that the heavy-eyed people of Etruria imagined such  gods, lingers on in this little Tuscan town, and the echo of its  ancient music vibrates in the stillness of the museum like the  murmur of waves in a shell. Or perhaps it is a magic in the air,  the subtle air of Tuscany, that poets sing of, which has inspired  more genius than we can find in all the rest of Italy.    For Arezzo, like Florence, has been the mother of great men.  Michelangelo, himself born but a few miles from Arezzo, wrote to  Vasari, 'Giorgio, of myself I have no power. I happened to be born  in the subtle air of your _paese_.'    Poets and artists, sculptors and musicians, have issued from  her walls. All the world knows that she bred Maecenas and  Petrarch, but only those who pause to read her chronicles know  how many of her sons have walked with History in the corridors of  Time--Margheritone, the Spinelli; Leonardo Bruni; Carlo Marsuppini,  and a host of other humanists; the fighting bishop, Guido Tarlati;  Vasari; and Guido Monaco, the Benedictine monk, born in the closing  years of the eleventh century, who was the inventor of our modern  system of musical notation.    Whether Arezzo occupies the site of Arretium, the city of the  Etruscan league, which is unlikely, or whether it rose like a  phoenix from the ashes of its ancient necropolis, or grew from a  Roman colony of that name near the Etruscan settlement, is not for  me to say, since antiquaries are undecided. In any case there is  little of either Etruscan or"]]]
