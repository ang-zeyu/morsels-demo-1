Even in spite of  Willoughby's personal resemblance to Dixon, there was a suggestion  of latent physical force and leathery durability in the bullock driver,  altogether lacking in the whaler, and equiponderated only by a certain air  of refinement.  How could it be otherwise?   Willoughby, of course,  had no horse--in fact, like Bassanio, all the wealth he had ran in his veins;  he was a gentleman.  Well for the world if all representatives of his Order  were as harmless, as inexpensive, and as unobtrusive as this poor fellow,  now situated like that most capricious poet, honest Ovid, among the Goths.    One generally feels a sort of diffidence in introducing one's self;  but I may remark that I was at that time a Government official,  of the ninth class; paid rather according to my grade than my merit,  and not by any means in proportion to the loafing I had to do.  Candidly, I was only a Deputy-Assistant-Sub-Inspector,  but with the reversion of the Assistant-Sub-Inspectorship itself  when it should please Atropos to snip the thread of my superior officer.    The repast being concluded, the drivers went into committee  on the subject of grass--a vital question in '83, as you may remember.    \"It's this way,\" said Mosey imperatively, and deftly weaving into his address  the thin red line of puissant adjective; \"You dunno what you're doin'  when you're foolin' with this run.  She's hair-trigger at the best o' times,  an' she's on full cock this year.  Best watched station on the track.  It's risk whatever way you take it.  We're middlin' safe to be collared  in the selection, an' we're jist as safe to be collared in the ram-paddick.  Choice between the divil an' the dam.  An' there's too big a township o' wagons  together.  Two's enough, an' three's a glutton, for sich a season as this.\"    \"I think Cooper and I had better push on to the ram-paddock,\"  suggested Thompson.  \"You three can work on the selection.  Division of labour's the secret of success, they say.\"    \"Secret of England's greatness,\" mused Dixon.  \"I forgit what  the (irrelevant expletive) that is.\"    \"The true secret of England's greatness lies in her dependencies,  Mr. Dixon,\" replied Willoughby handsomely; and straightway the serene,  appreciative expression of the bullock driver's face, rightly interpreted,  showed that his mind was engaged in a Graeco-Roman conflict  with the polysyllable, the latter being uppermost.    \"Well, no,\" said Mosey, replying to Thompson; \"no use separatin' now;  it's on'y spreadin' the risk; we should 'a' separated yesterday.  I would n't misdoubt the selection, on'y Cunningham told me the other day,  Magomery's shiftin' somebody to live there.  If that's so, it's up a tree,  straight.  The ram-paddick's always a risk--too near the station.\"    \"The hut on the selection was empty a week ago,\" I remarked.  \"I know it, for I camped there one night.\"    \"Good grass?\" inquired a chorus of voices.    \"About the best I've had this season.\"    \"We'll chance the selection,\" said Mosey decidedly.  \"Somebody can  ride on ahead, an' see the coast clear.  But they won't watch  a bit of a paddick in the thick o' the shearin', when there's nobody  livin' in it.\"    \"Squatters hed orter fine grass f'r wool teams, an' glad o' the chance,\"  observed Price, with unprintable emphasis.    \"Lot of sense in that remark,\" commented Mosey, with a similar potency  of adjective.    \"Well, this is about the last place God made,\" growled Cooper,  the crimson thread of kinship running conspicuously through his observation,  notwithstanding its narrow provinciality.    \"Roll up, Port Phillipers! the Sydney man's goin' to strike a match!\"  retorted Mosey.  \"I wonder what fetched a feller like you on-to  bad startin'-ground.  I swear we did n't want no lessons.\"    Cooper was too lazy to reply; and we smoked dreamily, while my kangaroo dog  silently abstracted a boiled leg of mutton from Price's tuckerbox,  and carried it out of sight.  By-and-by, all eyes converged  on a shapeless streak which had moved into sight in the restless,  glassy glitter of the plain, about a mile away.    \"Warrigal Alf going out on the lower track,\" remarked Thompson, at length.  \"He was coming behind Baxter and Donovan yesterday, but he stopped  opposite the station, talking to Montgomery and Martin, and the other fellows  lost the run of him.  I wonder where he camped last night?  He ought to be able to tell us where the safest grass is, considering  he's had a load in from the station.  But to tell you the truth,  I'm in favour of the ram-paddock.  If we're caught there, we'll most likely  only get insulted--and we can stand a lot of that--but if we're caught  in the selection, it's about seven years.  Then we can make the Lignum Swamp  to-morrow from the ram-paddock, and we can't make it from the selection.  So I think we better be moving; it'll be dark enough before we unyoke.  I've worked on that ram-paddock so often that I seem to have  a sort of title to it.\"    \"But there's lots o' changes since you was here last,\" said Mosey.  \"Magomery he's beginnin' to think he's got a sort o' title  to the ram-paddick now, considerin' it's all purchased.  Tell you what I'll do:  I'll slip over in two minits on Valiparaiser, an' consult with Alf.  Me an' him's as thick as thieves.\"    \"I'll go with you, Mosey,\" said I.  \"I've got some messages for him.  Keep an eye on my dog, Steve.\"    Mosey untied the fine upstanding grey horse from the rear of his wagon;  I hitched Bunyip to a tree, and mounted Fancy, and we cantered away together  across the plain; the ponderous empty wagon--Sydney-side pattern--with  eight bullocks in yoke and twelve travelling loose, coming more clearly  into detail through the vibrating translucence of the lower atmosphere.  Alf did n't deign to stop.  I noticed a sinister smile on his sad, stern face  as Mosey gaily accosted him.    \"An' how's the world usin' you, Alf?  Got red o' Pilot, I notice.  Ever see sich a suck-in?  Best at a distance, ain't he?  Tell you  what I come over for, Alf:  They say things is middlin' hot here on Runnymede;  an' we're in a (sheol) of a (adjective) stink about what to do with our frames  to-night.  Our wagons is over there on the other track, among the pines.  Where did you stop las' night?  Your carrion's as full as ticks.\"    \"I had them in the selection; took them out this morning after they lay down.\"    \"Good shot!\"    \"Why, I don't see how it concerns you.\"    \"The selection's reasonable safe--ain't it?\"    \"Please yourself about that.\"    \"Is the ram-paddick safe?\".    \"No.\"    \"Is there enough water in the tank at the selection?\"    \"How do I know?  There was enough for me.\"    \"I say, Alf,\" said I:  \"Styles, of Karowra, told me to let you know,  if possible, that you were right about the boring rods;  and he'll settle with you any time you call.  Also there's a letter for you  at Lochleven Station.  Two items.\"    \"I'm very much obliged to you for your trouble, Collins,\" replied Alf,  with a shade less of moroseness in his tone.    \"Well, take care o' yourself, ole son; you ain't always got me  to look after you,\" said Mosey pleasantly; and we turned our horses  and rode away.  \"Evil-natured beggar, that,\" he continued.  \"He's floggin' the cat now, 'cos he laid us on to the selection  in spite of his self.  If that feller don't go to the bottomless  for his disagreeableness, there's somethin' radic'ly wrong about Providence.  I'm a great believer in Providence, myself, Tom; an' what's more,  I try to live up to my (adj.) religion.  I'm sure I don't want to see  any pore (fellow) chained up in fire an' brimstone for millions o' millions  o' years, an' a worm tormentin' him besides; but I don't see  what the (adj.  sheol) else they can do with Alf.  Awful to think of it.\"  Mosey sighed piously, then resumed, \"Grand dog you got since I seen you last.  Found the (animal), I s'pose?\"    \"No, Mosey.  Bought him fair.\"    \"Jist so, jist so.  You ought to give him to me.  He's bound to pick up a bait  with you; you're sich a careless &c., &c.\" And so the conversation ran  on the subject of dogs during the return ride.    On our reaching the wagons, it was unanimously resolved that the selection  should be patronised.  This being so, there was no hurry--rather the reverse--  for the selection was not to be reached till dusk.    You will understand that the bullock drivers' choice of accommodation  lay between the selection, the ram-paddock, and a perisher on the plain.  The selection was four or five miles ahead; the near corner of the ram-paddock  about two miles farther still; whilst a perisher on the plain is seldom  hard to find in a bad season, when the country is stocked for good seasons.  Runnymede home station--Mooney and Montgomery, owners; J.  G.  Montgomery,  managing partner--was a mile or so beyond the further corner  of the ram-paddock, and was the central source of danger.    Presently the tea leaves were thrown out of the billies;  the tuckerboxes were packed on the pole-fetchels; and the teams got under way.  Thompson pressed me to camp with him and Cooper for the night,  and I readily consented; thus temporarily eluding a fatality which was  in the habit of driving me from any given direction to Runnymede homestead--  a fatality which, I trust, I shall have no farther occasion to notice  in these pages.    We therefore tied Fancy beside Thompson's horse at the rear of his wagon,  and disposed Bunyip's pack-saddle and load on the top of the wool;  the horse, of course, following Fancy according to his daily habit.    A quarter of a mile of stiff pulling through the sand of the pine-ridge,  and the plain opened out again.

She was a devout Christian woman, who cheered and encouraged Arndt amid  his many cares, alleviated every burden to the extent of her ability, and  was always regarded by him with tenderness and gratitude. They were  childless; but many an orphan found that their hearts could overflow with  love towards the young and destitute--a love as full of warmth as beloved  children have ever experienced parental love to be.    § 6. In this first pastoral charge of Arndt, the unhappy state of affairs  subjected him, particularly during the latter part of the seven years  which he spent in it, to a \"Lutheran martyrdom,\" as Tholuck expresses  himself (Herzog. Encyk. I., 536). The duke, John George, who now reigned  (a relative of the palsgrave, or count palatine, Casimir, a zealous  Calvinist), after various inward struggles, abandoned the Lutheran faith,  and, in the year 1596, publicly adopted the Reformed faith, a few years  after the transactions to which we now refer. Even Protestant rulers, who  had not yet learned the theory that a union of church and state can  operate only perniciously, perpetually interfered in the internal affairs  of the church.--At this period it was the custom of Lutheran pastors, when  they administered the rite of Baptism, to follow the liturgical form which  prescribed \"exorcism.\" This feature of the whole baptismal form, which was  introduced as early as the third century, or even earlier (before the days  of Tertullian and Origen), consisted simply in a sentence adjuring the  evil spirit to depart from the subject of Baptism. The early practice had,  like others, been gradually associated, after the rise and development of  popery, with superstitious ideas, such as was also the case with the  Lord's Supper, until it assumed an absurd and even revolting form. At the  period of the Reformation, Zwingli and Calvin (Inst. IV., c. 15, 19; c.  19, 24) rejected the whole form of exorcism. Luther and Melanchthon, on  the other hand, after discarding the popish excrescences, believed that  the scriptural doctrine which the early form involved or suggested,  authorized the retention of the practice, when restricted to a very plain  and simple formula, expressive of a scriptural truth.--Now, at that period,  as it is well known, unfriendly feelings, engendered by various causes,  existed to a certain extent, between the heads respectively of the  Reformed and the Lutheran churches, in consequence of which even harmless  customs which none would, under ordinary circumstances, either advocate or  condemn with partisan feeling, assumed a confessional character. Such was  the case with the purified and simple Lutheran baptismal sentence  containing the \"exorcism.\"    § 7. Arndt's course in this matter has often been misunderstood; as it,  however, demonstrates him to have been alike a very firm and conscientious  man, and also an uncompromising supporter of the distinctive doctrines and  usages of the Lutheran Church, the following details may be appropriately  furnished.--The language which Luther retained in his form for Baptism  (_Taufbuechlein_), after omitting all popish and superstitious practices,  was the following. Between the prayer and the reading of Mark 10:13-16,  the pastor says: \"I adjure thee, thou unclean spirit, in the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou go out and depart  from this servant of Jesus Christ, Amen.\"--Luther understood the form to be  a declaration or distinct confession of the doctrine of Original Sin, and  a renunciation of Satan. Still, the Lutheran Church, as such, never  recognized the _necessity_ of this ancient form, and its confessional  writings never allude to it. After the excitement of feeling peculiar to  Arndt's age, had been allayed by time, the Lutheran Church regarded the  whole as a mere _adiaphoron_, that is, a \"thing indifferent,\" not  essentially involving any principle whatever, inasmuch as the doctrine of  Original Sin had already been very explicitly set forth and confessed in  her Symbolical Books. Such was the opinion of the eminent Lutheran  dogmatical writers, Gerhard, Quenstedt, Hollaz, etc.; and men like Baier  and Baumgarten even advocated the discontinuance of the practice. It is no  longer retained in any prominent manner in the Lutheran Church.--But in the  age in which Arndt lived, who was not a man that would obstinately cling  to a mere form, the _rejection_ of the formula of Exorcism _did_ involve a  principle; for, under the peculiar circumstances, that rejection might be  understood to be, first, a rejection of the doctrine of Original Sin, and,  secondly, an affirmation that the children of believing parents were in  the kingdom of heaven, even before they had received Baptism. But all this  seemed to conflict with the Pauline doctrine that all are \"by nature the  children of wrath.\" Eph. 2:3. While, then, J. Ben. Carpzov, the  distinguished interpreter of the Symbolical Books, who died in 1557,  decides that the \"Exorcism\" is in itself a matter of indifference, and may  without scruple be dropped, he nevertheless holds that if the omission of  it should be understood as a denial of the Scripture doctrine of the  corruption of human nature (Original Sin), it becomes, in such a case, a  matter of principle to retain the formula. (_Isagoge_, etc., p. 1122  _ff._; 1608.) Walch, the other eminent interpreter of the Symbolical Books  (_Introductio_, etc.), does not refer to the matter at all, as it is no  essential part of the Lutheran Creed. But Arndt, who was a calm,  sagacious, and conscientious observer, and who may justly be considered as  claiming that, in forming a judgment respecting him, we should not  overlook the spirit of his times, apprehended that the suppression of the  \"exorcism\" was secretly designed to be the forerunner of the suppression  of the entire Lutheran faith, which constituted the life of his soul; he  could not, under such circumstances, consent to endanger his most precious  treasure.    § 8. Now the duke, John George, after his virtual adoption of the Reformed  faith and practice, issued a peremptory order that the formula of Exorcism  should no longer be employed in his dominions at the baptism of any  infant. Arndt, who was characterized by a childlike submission to those in  authority, as long as matters of principle were not involved, could not  renounce his faith in God's word, and, especially, his personal conviction  of the natural depravity of the human heart. He might have consented to  drop a mere form; but he saw here an entering wedge, which justly alarmed  him. His apprehensions were subsequently proved to have been only too well  founded, when, soon afterwards, Luther's Catechism was suppressed, and  another substituted in its place. Hence, as he could not renounce a  prominent feature of the Lutheran creed, he firmly and positively refused  to obey the ducal command. He remarked, in the written statement which  embodied his reasons for refusing to obey, and which was submitted to the  civil authorities, that his conscience would not allow him to comply with  such a demand of the secular authority--that the orthodox fathers, who had,  during thirteen centuries, connected \"exorcism\" with Baptism, understood  it in accordance with the mind and true sense of the Scriptures (_ex mente  et vero sensu Scripturae_)--that it was, therefore, by no means \"an impious  ceremony\" (as the civil ruler, a layman, had thought proper to designate  it),--that he must necessarily abide by the decision of his conscience--and,  that he would humbly submit to any sentence which his prince might  pronounce in the case. The date which he affixed to the document, is Sept.  10, 1590. That sentence, which was soon afterwards proclaimed, deposed  Arndt from his office, and banished him from the ducal territories. The  reader of Book I. of the \"True Christianity,\" will now understand, after  observing the earnestness with which the author insists on the doctrine of  Original Sin, or the depravity of human nature, that he could not  conscientiously take any step which would, even indirectly, involve a  denial of that sad truth of the Bible,--a truth to which his knowledge of  his own heart daily testified.    § 9. But the Divine Head of the Church did not depose this faithful  minister. At the very time when Arndt seemed to be homeless and  friendless, two important posts were offered to him--one in Mansfeld, the  other in Quedlinburg, an important city, which, after belonging to various  rulers, has at last been incorporated with the monarchy of Prussia. The  city adopted the Lutheran faith in 1539. Arndt decided to make this place  his home, and he labored here with eminent success, during a period of  seven years, as the pastor of the church of St. Nicholas. However, he also  endured much affliction in this new charge, and his holy zeal and devout  spirit, while fully appreciated by intelligent and enlightened believers,  were misunderstood and even hated by others, so that he longed to be  transferred to another field of labor.    § 10. He was at length permitted to depart, and removed to the city of  Brunswick, situated in the territory of the duke of Brunswick; it aspired  at that time to become a \"free city,\" subject directly to the German  emperor. The warfare between the duke and the city, during Arndt's  residence in the latter, subjected him to many sore trials. His abode in  it, extending from 1590 to 1608, is specially interesting, as he then  presented to the religious community Book I. of his \"True Christianity.\"  Dr. A. Wildenhahn, who has, in recent times, furnished us with various  charming volumes, descriptive of the times, respectively, of Luther,  Spener, Paul Gerhardt, etc., in which he combines \"fiction and truth,\" has  selected this period of Arndt's history, as the one to which he dedicates  his two delightful volumes, entitled \"Johan"]]]
