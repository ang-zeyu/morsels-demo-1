On the morrow, being tired  of killing, the people began to destroy, and this phase lasted a long  time, it being less fatiguing to throw stones about than corpses.  All  the convents, all the monasteries, all the houses of the priests and  canons were attacked in turn; nothing was spared except the cathedral,  before which axes and crowbars seemed to lose their power, and the church  of Ste. Eugenie, which was turned into a powder-magazine.  The day of the  great butchery was called \"La Michelade,\" because it took place the day  after Michaelmas, and as all this happened in the year 1567 the Massacre  of St.  Bartholomew must be regarded as a plagiarism.    But from this period, each flux and reflux bears more and more the  peculiar character of the party which for the moment is triumphant; when  the Protestants get the upper hand, their vengeance is marked by  brutality and rage; when the Catholics are victorious, the retaliation is  full of hypocrisy and greed.  The Protestants pull down churches and  monasteries, expel the monks, burn the crucifixes, take the body of some  criminal from the gallows, nail it on a cross, pierce its side, put a  crown of thorns round its temples and set it up in the market-place--an  effigy of Jesus on Calvary.  The Catholics levy contributions, take back  what they had been deprived of, exact indemnities, and although ruined by  each reverse, are richer than ever after each victory.            Mary Stuart  marys10.txt or marys10.zip [Etext #2744]    Mary was a harmony in which the most ardent enthusiast for sculptured  form could have found nothing to reproach.  This was indeed Mary's great  and real crime: one single imperfection in face or figure, and she would  not have died upon the scaffold.  Besides, to Elizabeth, who had never  seen her, and who consequently could only judge by hearsay, this beauty  was a great cause of uneasiness and of jealousy, which she could not even  disguise, and which showed itself unceasingly in eager questions.    Unfortunately for her honour, Mary, always more the woman than the queen,  while, on the contrary, Elizabeth was always more the queen than the  woman, had no sooner regained her power than her first royal act was to  exhume Rizzio, who had been quietly buried on the threshold of the chapel  nearest Holyrood Palace, and to have him removed to the burial-place of  the Scottish kings, compromising herself still more by the honours she  paid him dead, than by the favour she had granted him living.              NISIDA  nisid10.txt or nisid10.zip [Etext #2747]    The priests had already begun to sing the death hymn; the executioner was  ready, the procession had set out, when Solomon the fisherman appeared  suddenly on the threshold of the prison, his eyes aflame and his brow  radiant with the halo of the patriarchs.  The old man drew himself up to  his full height, and raising in one hand the reddened knife, said in a  sublime voice, \"The sacrifice is fulfilled.  God did not send His angel  to stay the hand of Abraham.\"    The crowd carried him in triumph!    [The details of this case are recorded in the archives of the Criminal  Court at Naples.  We have changed nothing in the age or position of the  persons who appear in this narrative.  One of the most celebrated  advocates at the Neapolitan bar secured the acquittal of the old man.]              KARL LUDWIG SAND  ksand10.txt or ksand10.zip [Etext #2745]    Fundamentally nothing is great, you see, and nothing small, when things  are looked at apart from one another.

Fourneau having saluted Grandier, proceeded to carry out his orders,  whereupon a judge said it was not sufficient to shave the body of the  prisoner, but that his nails must also be torn out, lest the devil should  hide beneath them.  Grandier looked at the speaker with an expression of  unutterable pity, and held out his hands to Fourneau; but Forneau put  them gently aside, and said he would do nothing of the kind, even were  the order given by the cardinal-duke himself.            LA CONSTANTIN  const10.txt or const10.zip [Etext #2749]    Madly in love, which is the same as saying that he was hopelessly blind,  silly, and dense to everything around him.    It is singular how very clear-sighted we can be about things that don't  touch us.    There in semi-isolation and despoiled of her greatness lived  Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, formerly companion to Mademoiselle de Pons  and then maid of honour to Anne of Austria.  Her love intrigues and the  scandals they gave rise to had led to her dismissal from court.  Not that  she was a greater sinner than many who remained behind, only she was  unlucky enough or stupid enough to be found out.  Her admirers were so  indiscreet that they had not left her a shred of reputation, and in a  court where a cardinal is the lover of a queen, a hypocritical appearance  of decorum is indispensable to success.  So Angelique had to suffer for  the faults she was not clever enough to hide.            DERUES  derue10.txt or derue10.zip [Etext #2748]    \"All passions,\" says La Bruyere,--\"all passions are deceitful; they  disguise themselves as much as possible from the public eye; they hide  from themselves.  There is no vice which has not a counterfeit  resemblance to some virtue, and which does not profit by it.\"    The whole life of Derues bears testimony to the truth of this  observation.  An avaricious poisoner, he attracted his victims by the  pretence of fervent and devoted piety, and drew them into the snare where  he silently destroyed them.    As soon as his head was covered, the executioner gave the signal.  One  would have thought a very few blows would have finished so frail a being,  but he seemed as hard to kill as the venomous reptiles which must be  crushed and cut to pieces before life is extinct, and the 'coup de grace'  was found necessary.  The executioner uncovered his head and showed the  confessor that the eyes were closed and that the heart had ceased to  beat.  The body was then removed from the cross, the hands and feet  fastened together, and it was thrown on the funeral pile. While the  execution was proceeding the people applauded.  On the morrow they bought  up the fragments of bone, and hastened to buy lottery tickets, in the  firm conviction that these precious relics would bring luck to the  fortunate possessors!            THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK  ironm10.txt or ironm.zip [Etext #2751]    Voltaire added a few further details which had been given him by M.  de  Bernaville, the successor of M. de Saint-Mars, and by an old physician of  the Bastille who had attended the prisoner whenever his health required a  doctor, but who had never seen his face, although he had \"often seen his  tongue and his body.\"  He also asserted that M. de Chamillart was the  last minister who was in the secret, and that when his son-in-law,  Marshal de la Feuillade, besought him on his knees, de Chamillart being  on his deathbed, to tell him the name of the Man in the Iron Mask, the  minister replied that he was under a solemn oath never to reveal the  secret, it being an affair of state.  To all these details, which the  marshal acknowledges to be correct, Voltaire adds a remarkable note:  \"What increases our wonder is, that when the unknown captive was sent to  the Iles Sainte-Marguerite no personage of note disappeared from the  European stage.\"              JOAN OF NAPLES  jonap10.txt or jonap10.zip [Etext #2750]    The next morning the people were beforehand with the executioner, loudly  demanding their prey.  All the national troops and mercenaries that the  judicial authorities could command were echelonned in the streets,  opposing a sort of dam to the torrent of the raging crowd.  The sudden  insatiable cruelty that too often degrades human nature had awaked in the  populace: all heads were turned with hatred and frenzy; all imaginations  inflamed with the passion for revenge; groups of men and women, roaring  like wild beasts, threatened to knock down the walls of the prison, if  the condemned were not handed over to them to take to the place of  punishment: a great murmur arose, continuous, ever the same, like the  growling of thunder: the queen's heart was petrified with terror.    That same evening the sentence, to the great joy of all, was proclaimed,  that Joan was innocent and acquitted of all concern in the assassination  of her husband.  But as her conduct after the event and the indifference  she had shown about pursuing the authors of the crime admitted of no  valid excuse, the pope declared that there were plain traces of magic,  and that the wrong-doing attributed to Joan was the result of some  baneful charm cast upon her, which she could by no possible means resist.            MARTIN GUERRE  mguer10.txt or mguer10.zip [Etext #2752]    On the 10th of, August 1557, an inauspicious day in the history of  France, the roar of cannon was still heard at six in the evening in the  plains of St. Quentin; where the French army had just been destroyed by  the united troops of England and Spain, commanded by the famous Captain  Emanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy.

This abridgment is an  attempt to meet the wish and thereby to bring the work within the  range of a wider circle of readers. While the bulk of the book has  been greatly reduced, I have endeavoured to retain its leading  principles, together with an amount of evidence sufficient to  illustrate them clearly. The language of the original has also for  the most part been preserved, though here and there the exposition  has been somewhat condensed. In order to keep as much of the text as  possible I have sacrificed all the notes, and with them all exact  references to my authorities. Readers who desire to ascertain the  source of any particular statement must therefore consult the larger  work, which is fully documented and provided with a complete  bibliography.    In the abridgment I have neither added new matter nor altered the  views expressed in the last edition; for the evidence which has come  to my knowledge in the meantime has on the whole served either to  confirm my former conclusions or to furnish fresh illustrations of  old principles. Thus, for example, on the crucial question of the  practice of putting kings to death either at the end of a fixed  period or whenever their health and strength began to fail, the body  of evidence which points to the wide prevalence of such a custom has  been considerably augmented in the interval. A striking instance of  a limited monarchy of this sort is furnished by the powerful  mediaeval kingdom of the Khazars in Southern Russia, where the kings  were liable to be put to death either on the expiry of a set term or  whenever some public calamity, such as drought, dearth, or defeat in  war, seemed to indicate a failure of their natural powers. The  evidence for the systematic killing of the Khazar kings, drawn from  the accounts of old Arab travellers, has been collected by me  elsewhere.[1] Africa, again, has supplied several fresh examples of  a similar practice of regicide. Among them the most notable perhaps  is the custom formerly observed in Bunyoro of choosing every year  from a particular clan a mock king, who was supposed to incarnate  the late king, cohabited with his widows at his temple-tomb, and  after reigning for a week was strangled.[2] The custom presents a  close parallel to the ancient Babylonian festival of the Sacaea, at  which a mock king was dressed in the royal robes, allowed to enjoy  the real king's concubines, and after reigning for five days was  stripped, scourged, and put to death. That festival in its turn has  lately received fresh light from certain Assyrian inscriptions,[3]  which seem to confirm the interpretation which I formerly gave of  the festival as a New Year celebration and the parent of the Jewish  festival of Purim.[4] Other recently discovered parallels to the  priestly kings of Aricia are African priests and kings who used to  be put to death at the end of seven or of two years, after being  liable in the interval to be attacked and killed by a strong man,  who thereupon succeeded to the priesthood or the kingdom.[5]    [1] J.

Palmer, in _Journal of the African Society,_ July 1912, pp. 403,  407 _sq._    With these and other instances of like customs before us it is no  longer possible to regard the rule of succession to the priesthood  of Diana at Aricia as exceptional; it clearly exemplifies a  widespread institution, of which the most numerous and the most  similar cases have thus far been found in Africa. How far the facts  point to an early influence of Africa on Italy, or even to the  existence of an African population in Southern Europe, I do not  presume to say. The pre-historic historic relations between the two  continents are still obscure and still under investigation.    Whether the explanation which I have offered of the institution is  correct or not must be left to the future to determine. I shall  always be ready to abandon it if a better can be suggested. Meantime  in committing the book in its new form to the judgment of the public  I desire to guard against a misapprehension of its scope which  appears to be still rife, though I have sought to correct it before  now. If in the present work I have dwelt at some length on the  worship of trees, it is not, I trust, because I exaggerate its  importance in the history of religion, still less because I would  deduce from it a whole system of mythology; it is simply because I  could not ignore the subject in attempting to explain the  significance of a priest who bore the title of King of the Wood, and  one of whose titles to office was the plucking of a bough--the  Golden Bough--from a tree in the sacred grove. But I am so far from  regarding the reverence for trees as of supreme importance for the  evolution of religion that I consider it to have been altogether  subordinate to other factors, and in particular to the fear of the  human dead, which, on the whole, I believe to have been probably the  most powerful force in the making of primitive religion. I hope that  after this explicit disclaimer I shall no longer be taxed with  embracing a system of mythology which I look upon not merely as  false but as preposterous and absurd. But I am too familiar with the  hydra of error to expect that by lopping off one of the monster's  heads I can prevent another, or even the same, from sprouting again.  I can only trust to the candour and intelligence of my readers to  rectify this serious misconception of my views by a comparison with  my own express declaration.    J. G. FRAZER.    1 BRICK COURT, TEMPLE, LONDON,  June 1922.        I. The King of the Wood      1. Diana and Virbius    WHO does not know Turner's picture of the Golden Bough? The scene,  suffused with the golden glow of imagination in which the divine  mind of Turner steeped and transfigured even the fairest natural  landscape, is a dream-like vision of the little woodland lake of  Nemi-- \"Diana's Mirror,\" as it was called by the ancients. No one  who has seen that calm water, lapped in a green hollow of the Alban  hills, can ever forget it. The two characteristic Italian villages  which slumber on its banks, and the equally Italian palace whose  terraced gardens descend steeply to the lake, hardly break the  stillness and even the solitariness of the scene. Diana herself  might still linger by this lonely shore, still haunt these woodlands  wild.    In antiquity this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and  recurring tragedy. On the northern shore of the lake, right under  the precipitous cliffs on which the modern village of Nemi is  perched, stood the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis,  or Diana of the Wood. The lake and the grove were sometimes known as  the lake and grove of Aricia. But the town of Aricia (the modern La  Riccia) was situated about three miles off, at the foot of the Alban  Mount, and separated by a steep descent from the lake, which lies in  a small crater-like hollow on the mountain side. In this sacred  grove there grew a certain tree round which at any time of the day,  and probably far into the night, a grim figure might be seen to  prowl. In his hand he carried a drawn sword, and he kept peering  warily about him as if at every instant he expected to be set upon  by an enemy. He was a priest and a murderer; and the man for whom he  looked was sooner or later to murder him and hold the priesthood in  his stead. Such was the rule of the sanctuary. A candidate for the  priesthood could only succeed to office by slaying the priest, and  having slain him, he retained office till he was himself slain by a  stronger or a craftier.    The post which he held by this precarious tenure carried with it the  title of king; but surely no crowned head ever lay uneasier, or was  visited by more evil dreams, than his. For year in, year out, in  summer and winter, in fair weather and in foul, he had to keep his  lonely watch, and whenever he snatched a troubled slumber it was at  the peril of his life. The least relaxation of his vigilance, the  smallest abatement of his strength of limb or skill of fence, put  him in jeopardy; grey hairs might seal his death-warrant. To gentle  and pious pilgrims at the shrine the sight of him might well seem to  darken the fair landscape, as when a cloud suddenly blots the sun on  a bright day. The dreamy blue of Italian skies, the dappled shade of  summer woods, and the sparkle of waves in the sun, can have accorded  but ill with that stern and sinister figure. Rather we picture to  ourselves the scene as it may have been witnessed by a belated  wayfarer on one of those wild autumn nights when the dead leaves are  falling thick, and the winds seem to sing the dirge of the dying  year. It is a sombre picture, set to melancholy music--the  background of forest showing black and jagged against a lowering and  stormy sky, the sighing of the wind in the branches, the rustle of  the withered leaves under foot, the lapping of the cold water on the  shore, and in the foreground, pacing to and fro, now in twilight and  now in gloom, a dark figure with a glitter of steel at the shoulder  whenever the pale moon, riding clear of the cloud-rack, peers down  at him through the matted boughs.    The strange rule of this priesthood has no parallel in classical  antiquity, and cannot be"]]]
