Its iconoclastic  attitude alone toward literary tradition may entitle it to a certain  influence as a remote precursor of the romantic movement. The  publication which fought the battle for Romanticism was the  _Conciliatore_ (1818-1819). Around it was constituted the Romantic  school which produced Grossi and the others. Most of its followers in  the beginning were Lombardians, therefore under the espionage of the  Austrian Government. They were particularly Tommaso Grossi, the author  of a romance of the fourteenth century entitled \"Marco Visconti,\" of  \"Ildegonda,\" and \"I Lombardi\" (the best seller of its day), and Giovanni  Berchet, who, though of French descent, was the most Italian of  Italians, and spent a large part of his life in exile in Switzerland and  England.    Soon the Romanticists were given a political complexion--they were  resigned to their fate of being slaves to Austria--at least they were  accused of this by the classicists. In truth they were digging the  trenches in which were later implanted the bombs whose explosion put the  Austrians to flight.    The predominant figure of the romantic period was Alessandro Manzoni  (1785-1873). It is no exaggeration to say that he carried fame of  Italian letters to greater numbers of people the world over than any  writer save Dante. In 1827 he published a novel, \"I Promessi Sposi\"  (\"The Betrothed Ones\"), which Walter Scott said was the best ever  written, and this opinion was seconded by Goethe. He had shown his  emancipation from classicism in two earlier plays, \"Carmagnola\" and  \"Adelchi,\" but it was not until the romance above mentioned and which  earned his immortality that the romantic triumph can be said to have  occurred in Italy. The men who carried the movement forward were  Pellico, Niccolini, Grossi, D'Azeglio, Giordani, Leopardi, Giusti, and  many others.    Among these the two who have been most favored by posterity are Silvio  Pellico (1789-1854), principally because of the book in which he  described his experiences in Austrian dungeons, \"Le mie Prigioni\" (\"My  Prisons\"), and Leopardi, the intellectual giant of an arid epoch. The  immortality of the former is founded in sentiment, of the latter in  merit.    The poet who had greatest popularity in Italy at this time was Giuseppe  Giusti (1809-1850), a satirist who chose verse as his medium. Although  posterity has not given him a very high rating, his \"Versi\" are still  widely read in Italy. His most appealing possession was ability to  express in scannable, rememberable, singable verse what may be called  every-day sentiment, to depict simple characters whose virtues every one  would like to have, and to interlace political satires with the most  panoplied, pathetic, patriotic sentiments. There is no safer way to  sense to-day the sentiment of the first half of the nineteenth century  of Italy than to read Giusti's poems. His \"All'Amica Lontana\" (\"To the  Friend Far Away\"), \"Gli Umanitari\" (\"The Humanitarians\"), and his poems  of spleen and of dream have a sprightliness and freshness as if they  were of yesterday. Dario Niccodemi has recently borrowed the title  \"Prete Pero\" from one of Giusti's poems for a comedy in which is  depicted the conduct of a simple, honest, pious priest confronted with  the conflict of ecclesiastical instructions and war problems. Giusti's  brief life was a strange mixture of potential joy and actual suffering.  In the vigor of his manhood he was seized by a painful disease, and to  his sufferings was added the mental agony caused by fear of hydrophobia.    Giuseppina Guacci Nobile (1808-1848), of Naples, a contemporary of  Giusti, had great popularity as a poetess of sentiment. She sang of love  of country, of art, of husband, of children, of heaven, and when the  sadness of the times was so profound that she needs must sing of hate  she died.    Three poets of northern Italy must also be mentioned. Francesco  Dall'Ongaro, who, though born in the Friuli, went to Venice when he was  ten years old and lived for the rest of his life in the northern  provinces, had a tremendous popularity in the revolutionary period of  1848 because of a little collection of lyrics called \"Stornelli\";  Giovanni Prati, of Dasindo, Trent, whose permanent reputation as a poet  depends upon his ballads, became widely known through his poem  \"Edmenegarda\"; and Aleardo Aleardi, born at Verona in the early years of  the nineteenth century, whose best-known book, \"Le Prime Storie,\" was  extensively read.    The pillars of the romantic movement were soon erected in Central Italy  by the writings of Leopardi, Niccolini, and Giusti.    Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) had a personality that has fastened itself  upon Italy, even unto the present day, in a most extraordinary--one  might even say, inexplicable--way. He was laconic, silent, morose,  introspective, solitary, celibate. His filial love was readily  overdrawn; he loathed his ancestral home and environment; he contended  with ill health from infancy; he was denied the understanding friend,  save one, whose behavior toward Leopardi has been criticised severely.  He wandered solitarily about central Italy wrapped in the mantle of  introspection and veiled in melancholy until 1833, when he settled at  Naples, and there he remained four years, until he had attained his  thirty-ninth year, when he died under most distressing circumstances.  Ranieri, in his \"Sette Anni di Sodalizio con Giacomo Leopardi,\" gives  this description of Leopardi's appearance: he was of moderate height,  bent and thin, with a fair complexion that inclined to pallor, a large  head, a square, broad forehead, languid blue eyes, a short nose, and  very delicate features; his voice was modest and rather weak; his smile  ineffable and almost unearthly.    It is not easy for a foreigner to understand the exalted estimation in  which the poetry of Leopardi is held in Italy to-day. To do so one must  needs sense the spirit of the times when he lived. The \"whatever is is  right\" day of Pope had been succeeded by a day of tragedy the like of  which the world had perhaps never known, and things would never be again  as they were. Leopardi sung this change. He was the poet of pain and of  despair, the versifier of Schopenhauer's philosophy. He sang of  melancholy, but he was never reconciled to supine resignation. Though  classical in form, his poems are steeped with the romantic spirit.  Although a supporter of the romantic school, he scarcely can be called  an exponent or upholder of it. A familiarity with his writings is an  integral part of the education of all cultured Italians, and nearly  every schoolboy can recite parts of the poems \"To Italy\" or \"The Quiet  after the Storm.\"    Leopardi considered it was harder to write good prose than good verse.  Greek thoughts were clearer and more vivid to him than Latin or Italian.  It is a pitiable picture that Ranieri draws of him in Naples, suffering  from consumption and from dropsy, unable to read, turning night into  day, having dinner at midnight to the discomfiture of the household,  having to be nursed and entertained, disliking the country, and living  in abject terror of the cholera which then raged in Naples.    De Musset praised his work. Sainte-Beuve did homage to him, and at an  early date made his name familiar to French readers. The judgment of  posterity is the one that counts and not the judgment of individuals,  and Leopardi is Italy's greatest modern poet. De Sanctis said of him:  \"His songs are the most profound and occult verses of that laborious  transition called the nineteenth century.\" His death marked the close of  the first romantic period in Italy.    Gian Battista Niccolini (1785-1861) wrote tragedies, historical  romances, and poetry, the best known of which is \"Arnaldo da Brescia.\"  The Florentines have erected a noble monument to his memory in their  Westminster Abbey--the church of Santa Croce.    Massimo D'Azeglio (1798-1866), diplomat, statesman, and man of letters,  played a very conspicuous part in the political and social life of his  day, and left an extraordinarily interesting account of it and of his  period in \"I miei Ricordi\" (\"My Recollections\"), which no one desirous  of acquainting himself with the social life of the risorgimento period  fails to read.    A literary production of this period which must be mentioned, not  because of its merits but because it is a sign of the times, was that of  Cesare Cantu (1804-1895), a universal history in thirty-five volumes,  which went through forty editions. It displays lucidity of statement,  sequential narrative, and finished literary technic. It was highly  partisan and not based on critical study of documentary evidence. He saw  in all Italian writers, beginning with Dante, enemies of the church and  of God. All had something false in their art which it pleased him to  reveal. Italian writers were all anti-Catholic, and classic literature  was all pagan; he excepted Manzoni, however, and himself.    Two noteworthy historic writers were V. Gioberti (1801-1852) and  Pasquale Galluppi (1770-1846), though the latter confined himself  chiefly to philosophy. No review of the literature of this period should  fail to mention Francesco de Sanctis (1817-1883), one of the most  versatile and soundest literary critics, who was assiduous in calling  the attention of his countrymen to the writings of foreigners and in  keenly analyzing and evaluating home productions, and Pasquale Villari,  the historian of Savonarola and Macchiavelli.    There were two great literary figures in the romantic triumph of Italy  of the nineteenth century, Manzoni and Leopardi, and after their death  no figure of any importance came upon the stage for upward of a  generation.    During this period--from 1830 to 1860, let us say--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#2)"],[1,"vision,  would give different results as to the magnifying power of a lens. To  one who can see distinctly with the naked eye at a distance of five  inches, the magnifying power would seem and would indeed be only half  what we have assumed. Such instances are, however, rare; the focal  length of the eye usually ranges from six to twelve or fourteen  inches, so that the distance we first assumed of ten inches is very  near the true average, and is a convenient number, inasmuch as a  cipher added to the denominator of the fraction which expresses the  focal length of a lens gives its magnifying power. Thus a lens whose  focal length is one-sixteenth of an inch is said to magnify 160 times.    When the focal length of a lens is very small, it is difficult to  measure accurately the distance between its centre and its object. In  such cases the best way to obtain the focal length for parallel or  nearly parallel rays is to view the image of some distant object  formed by the lens in question through another lens of one inch solar  focal length, keeping both eyes open and comparing the image presented  through the two lenses with that of the naked eye. The proportion  between the two images so seen will be the focal length required. Thus  if the image seen by the naked eye is ten times as large as that shown  by the lenses, the focal length of the lens in question is one-tenth  of an inch. The panes of glass in a window, or courses of bricks in a  wall, are convenient objects for this purpose.    In whichever way the focal length of the lens is ascertained, the  rules given for deducing its magnifying power are not rigorously  correct, though they are sufficiently so for all practical purposes,  particularly as the whole rests on an assumption in regard to the  focal length of the eye, and as it does not in any way affect the  actual measurement of the object. To calculate with great precision  the magnifying power of a lens with a given focal length of eye, it is  necessary that the thickness of the lens be taken into the account,  and also the focal length of the eye itself.    We have hitherto considered a magnifying lens only in reference to its  enlargement of the object, or the increase of the angle under which  the object is seen. A further and equally important consideration is  that of the number of rays or quantity of light by which every point  of the object is rendered visible. The naked eye, as shown in Fig. 2,  admits from each point of every visible object a cone of light having  the diameter of the pupil for its base, and most persons are familiar  with that beautiful provision by which in cases of excessive  brilliancy the pupil spontaneously contracts to reduce the cone of  admitted light within bearable limits. This effect is still further  produced in the experiment already described, of looking at an object  through a needle-hole in a card, which is equivalent to reducing the  pupil to the size of a needle-hole. Seen in this way the object  becomes comparatively dark or obscure; because each point is seen by  means of a very small cone of light, and a little consideration will  suffice to explain the different effects produced by the needle-hole  and the lens. Both change the angular value of the cone of light  presented to the eye, but the lens changes the angle by bending the  extreme rays within the limits suited to distinct vision, while the  needle-hole effects the same purpose by cutting off the rays which  exceed those limits.    It has been shown that removing a brilliant object to a greater  distance will reduce the quantity of light which each point sends into  the eye, as effectually as viewing it through a needle-hole; and  magnifying an object by a lens has been shown to be the same thing in  some respects as removing it to a greater distance. We have to see the  magnified picture by the light emanating from the small object, and it  becomes a matter of difficulty to obtain from each point a sufficient  quantity of light to bear the diffusion of a great magnifying power.  We want to perform an operation just the reverse of applying the card  with the needle-hole to the eye--we want in some cases to bring into  the eye the largest possible pencil of light from each point of the  object.    Referring to Fig. 3, it will be observed that if the eye could see the  small arrow at the distance there shown without the intervention of  the lens, only a very small portion of the cones of light drawn from  its extremities would enter the pupil; whereas we have supposed that  after being bent by the lens the whole of this light enters the eye as  part of the cones of smaller angle whose summits are at C and D. These  cones will further explain the difference between large and small  pencils of light; those from the small arrow are large pencils; the  dotted cones from the large arrow are small pencils.    In assuming that the whole of this light could have been suffered to  enter the eye through the lens A B, we did so for the sake of not  perplexing the reader with too many considerations at once. He must  now learn that so large a pencil of light passing through a single  lens would be so distorted by the spherical figure of the lens, and by  the chromatic dispersion of the glass, as to produce a very confused  and imperfect image. This confusion may be greatly diminished by  reducing the pencil; for instance, by applying a stop, as it is  called, to the lens, which is neither more nor less than the  needle-hole applied to the eye. A small pencil of light may be thus  transmitted through a single lens without suffering from spherical  aberration or chromatic dispersion any amount of distortion which will  materially affect the figure of the object; but this quantity of light  is insufficient to bear diffusion over the magnified picture, which is  therefore too obscure to exhibit what we most desire to see--those  beautiful and delicate markings by which one kind of organic matter is  distinguished from another. With a small aperture these markings are  not seen at all: with a large aperture and a single lens they exhibit  a faint nebulous appearance enveloped in a chromatic mist, a state  which is of course utterly valueless to the naturalist, and not even  amusing to the amateur.    It becomes therefore a most important problem to reconcile a large  aperture with distinctness, or, as it is called, _definition_; and  this has been done in a considerable degree by effecting the required  amount of refraction through two or more lenses instead of one, thus  reducing the angles of incidence and refraction, and producing other  effects which will be shortly noticed. This was first accomplished in  a satisfactory manner by--        DR. WOLLASTON'S DOUBLET,    invented by the celebrated philosopher whose name it bears; it  consists of two plano-convex lenses (Fig. 4) having their focal  lengths in the proportion of 1 to 3, or nearly so, and placed at a  distance which can be ascertained best by actual experiment. Their  plane sides are placed towards the object, and the lens of shortest  focal length next the object.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    It appears that Dr. Wollaston was led to this invention by considering  that the Achromatic Huyghenean Eye-piece, which will be hereafter  described, would, if reversed, possess similar good properties as a  simple microscope. But it will be evident when the eye-piece is  understood, that the circumstances which render it achromatic are very  imperfectly applicable to the simple microscope, and that the doublet,  without a nice adjustment of the stop, would be valueless. Dr.  Wollaston makes no allusion to a stop, nor is it certain that he  contemplated its introduction, although his illness, which terminated  fatally soon after the presentation of his paper, may account for the  omission.    The nature of the corrections which take place in the doublet is  explained in the annexed diagram (Fig. 5), where L O L' is the object,  P a portion of the pupil, and D D the stop, or limiting aperture.    Now, it will be observed that each of the pencils of light from the  extremities L L' of the object is rendered eccentrical by the stop,  and of consequence each passes through the two lenses on opposite  sides of their common axis O P; thus each becomes affected by opposite  errors, which to some extent balance and correct each other. To take  the pencil L, for instance, which enters the eye at R B, R B; it is  bent to the right at the first lens, and to the left at the second;  and as each bending alters the direction of the blue rays more than  the red, and, moreover, as the blue rays fall nearer the margin of the  second lens, where the refraction, being more powerful than near the  centre, compensates in some degree for the greater focal length of the  second lens, the blue and red rays will emerge very nearly parallel,  and of consequence colorless to the eye. At the same time the  spherical aberration has been diminished by the circumstance that the  side of the pencil which passes one lens nearest the axis passes the  other nearest the margin.    This explanation applies only to the pencils near the extremities of  the object. The central pencil, it is obvious, would pass both lenses  symmetrically; the same portions of light occupying nearly the same  relative places on both lenses. The blue light would enter the second  lens nearer to its axis than the red, and being thus less refracted  than the red by the second lens, a small amount of compensation would  take place, quite different in principle and inferior in degree to  that which is produced in the eccentrical pencils. In the intermediate  spaces the corrections are still more imperfect and uncertain; and  this explains the cause of the aberrations which must of necessity  exist even in the best-made doublet. It is, however, infinitely  superior to a single lens, and will transmit a pencil "]]]
