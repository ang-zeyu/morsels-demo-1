I invite you to consider briefly with me the beginnings of known history  in our home region. Of the general character of that history, as a part  of the exploration and settlement of the lake region, you are already  familiar. What I undertake is to direct special attention to a few of  the individuals who made that history--for history, in the ultimate  analysis, is merely the record of the result of personal character and  influence; and it is striking to note how relatively few and individual  are the dominating minds.    Remembering this, when we turn to trace the story of the Niagara, we  find the initial impulses strikingly different from those which lie at  the base of history in many places. Often the first chapter in the story  is a record of war for war's sake--the aim being conquest, acquisition  of territory, or the search for gold. Not so here. The first invasion of  white men in this mid-lake region was a mission of peace and good will.  Our history begins in a sweet and heroic obedience to commands passed  down direct from the Founder of Christianity Himself. Into these wilds,  long before the banner of any earthly kingdom was planted here, was  borne the cross of Christ. Here the crucifix preceded the sword; the  altar was built before the hearth.    Now, I care not what the faith of the student be, he cannot escape the  facts. The cross is stamped upon the first page of our home history--of  this Buffalo and the banks of the Niagara; and whoever would know  something of that history must follow the footsteps of those who first  brought the cross to these shores. It is, therefore, a brief following  of the personal experiences of these early cross bearers that we  undertake; but first, a word may be permitted by way of reminder as to  the conditions here existing when our recorded history begins.    From remote days unrecorded, the territory bordering the Niagara,  between Lakes Erie and Ontario, was occupied by a nation of Indians  called the Neuters. A few of their villages were on the east side of the  river, the easternmost being supposed to have stood near the present  site of Lockport. The greater part of the Niagara peninsula of Ontario  and the north shore of Lake Erie was their territory. To the east of  them, in the Genesee valley and beyond, dwelt the Senecas, the  westernmost of the Iroquois tribes. To the north of them, on Lake Huron  and the Georgian Bay, dwelt the Hurons. About 1650 the Iroquois overran  the Neuter territory, destroyed the nation and made the region east of  the Niagara a part of their own territory; though more than a century  elapsed, after their conquest of the Neuters, before the Senecas made  permanent villages on Buffalo Creek and near the Niagara. It is  necessary to bear this fact in mind, in considering the visits of white  men to this region during that period; it had become territory of the  Senecas, but they only occupied it at intervals, on hunting or fishing  expeditions.    During the latter years of Neuter possession of our region, missionaries  began to approach the Niagara from two directions; but long before any  brave soul had neared it through what is now New York State,--then the  heart of the fierce Iroquois country,--others, more successful, had come  down from the early-established missions among the Hurons, had sojourned  among the Neuters and had offered Christian prayers among the savages  east of the Niagara.    Note, therefore, that the first white man known to have visited the  Niagara region was a Catholic priest. Moreover, so far as is  ascertained, he was the first man, coming from what is now Canada, to  bring the Christian faith into the present territory of the United  States. This man was Joseph de la Roche Dallion.[1] The date of his  visit is 1626.    Father Dallion was a Franciscan of the Recollect reform, who had been  for a time at the mission among the Hurons, then carried on jointly by  priests and lay brothers of the Recollects and also by Fathers of the  Society of Jesus. On October 18th of this year (1626), he left his  companions, resolved to carry the cross among the people of the Neuter  nation. An interpreter, Brusle, had \"told wonders\" of these people.  Brusle, it would seem, therefore, had been among them; and although, as  I have said, Father Dallion was the first white man known to have  reached the Niagara, yet it is just to consider the probabilities in the  case of this all but unknown interpreter. There are plausible grounds  for belief, but no proof, that Etienne Brusle was the first white man  who ever saw Niagara Falls. No adventurer in our region had a more  remarkable career than his, yet but little of it is known to us. He was  with Champlain on his journey to the Huron country. He left that  explorer in September, 1615, at the outlet of Lake Simcoe, and went on a  most perilous mission into the country of the Andastes, allies of the  Hurons, to enlist them against the Iroquois. The Andastes lived on the  head-waters of the Susquehanna, and along the south shore of Lake Erie,  the present site of Buffalo being generally included within the bounds  of their territory. Champlain saw nothing more of Brusle for three  years, but in the summer of 1618 met him at Saut St. Louis. Brusle had  had wonderful adventures, had even been bound to the stake and burned so  severely that he must have been frightfully scarred. The name by which  we know him may have been given him on this account. He was saved from  death by what the Indians regarded as an exhibition of wrath on the part  of the Great Spirit. I find no trace of him between 1618 and 1626, when  Father Dallion appears to have taken counsel of him regarding the  Neuters. Brusle was murdered by the Hurons near Penetanguishene in 1632.  What is known of him is learned from Champlain's narrative of the voyage  of 1618 (edition of 1627). Sagard also speaks of him, and says he made  an exploration of the upper lakes--a claim not generally credited.  Parkman, drawing from these sources and the \"Relations,\" tells his story  in \"The Pioneers of France in the New World,\" admiringly calls him \"That  Pioneer of Pioneers,\" and says that he seems to have visited the Eries  in 1615.    The interesting thing about him in connection with our present study is  the fact that he appears to have been the forerunner of Dallion among  the savages of the Niagara. There is no white man named in history who  may be even conjectured, with any plausibility, to have visited the  Niagara earlier than Brusle.[2]    Stimulated by this interpreter's reports, by the encouragement of his  companions and the promptings of his own zeal, Father Dallion set out  for the unknown regions. Two Frenchmen, Grenole and Lavallee,  accompanied him. They tramped the trail for six days through the woods,  apparently rounding the western end of Lake Ontario, and coming eastward  through the Niagara Peninsula. They were well received at the villages,  given venison, squashes and parched corn to eat, and were shown no sign  of hostility. \"All were astonished to see me dressed as I was,\" writes  the father, \"and to see that I desired nothing of theirs, except that I  invited them by signs to lift their eyes to heaven, make the sign of the  cross and receive the faith of Jesus Christ.\" The good priest, however,  had another object, somewhat unusual to the men of his calling. At the  sixth village, where he had been advised to remain, a council was held.  \"There I told them, as well as I could, that I came on behalf of the  French to contract alliance and friendship with them, and to invite them  to come to trade. I also begged them to allow me to remain in their  country, to be able to instruct them in the law of our God, which is the  only means of going to paradise.\" The Neuters accepted the priest's  offers, and the first recorded trade in the Niagara region was made when  he presented them \"little knives and other trifles.\" They adopted him  into the tribe, and gave him a father, the chief Souharissen.    After this cordial welcome, Grenole and Lavallee returned to the Hurons,  leaving Father Joseph \"the happiest man in the world, hoping to do  something there to advance God's glory, or at least to discover the  means, which would be no small thing, and to endeavor to discover the  mouth of the river of Hiroquois, in order to bring them to trade.\" After  speaking of the people and his efforts to teach them, he continues: \"I  have always seen them constant in their resolution to go with at least  four canoes to the trade, if I would guide them, the whole difficulty  being that we did not know the way. Yroquet, an Indian known in those  countries, who had come there with twenty of his men hunting for beaver,  and who took fully 500, would never give us any mark to know the mouth  of the river. He and several Hurons assured us that it was only ten  days' journey to the trading place; but we were afraid of taking one  river for another, and losing our way or dying of hunger on the land.\"  So excellent an authority as Dr. John Gilmary Shea says: \"This was  evidently the Niagara River, and the route through Lake Ontario. He  (Dallion) apparently crossed the river, as he was on the Iroquois  frontier.\" The great conquest of the Neuters by the Iroquois was not  until 1648 or 1650. Just what the \"Iroquois frontier\" was in 1627 is  uncertain. It appears to have been about midway between the Niagara and  the Genesee, the easternmost Neuter village being some thirty miles east  of the Niagara.

They are primarily  day fliers and are remarkable for the delicacy and beauty of their  membranous wings, covered with myriads of tiny scales that overlap one  another like the shingles on a house and show an infinite variety of  hue through the coloring of the scales and their arrangement upon the  translucent membrane running between the wing veins. It is this  characteristic structure of the wings that gives to the great order of  butterflies and moths its name Lepidoptera, meaning scale-winged.    In the general structure of the body, the butterflies resemble other  insects. There are three chief divisions: head, thorax, and abdomen.  The head bears the principal sense organs; the thorax, the organs of  locomotion; and the abdomen, the organs of reproduction.    By examining a butterfly's head through a lens it is easy to see the  principal appendages which it bears. Projecting forward from the  middle of the top is a pair of long feelers or antennae. Each of these  consists of short joints which in general may be divided into three  groups: first, a few large joints at the base connecting the feeler  with the head; second, many rather small joints which make up the  principal length; third, several larger joints which make up the outer  part or \"club\" of the antennae. In the case of the Skippers, there are  in addition a number of small joints coming to a sharp point at the  end of the club. Just below the insertion of the antennae on each side  of the head are the large compound eyes, which are almost  hemispherical. With a powerful glass, one can see the honeycomb-like  facets, of which there are thousands, making up each eye. Just below  the eyes there are two hairy projections, called the palpi, between  which is the coiled tongue or sucking tube. (_See plate, page 64-65._)       [Illustration: Butterfly Antennae, magnified. (From Holland)]    Anatomically the thorax is divided into three parts--the prothorax,  the mesathorax, and the metathorax; but the lines of division between  these parts are not easily seen without denuding the skin of its hairy  covering. The prothorax bears the first pair of legs. The mesathorax  bears the front pair of wings and the second pair of legs. The  metathorax bears the hind pair of wings and the third pair of legs. In  many butterflies, the first pair of legs are so reduced in size that  they are not used in walking.    The abdomen is composed of eight or nine distinct rings or segments,  most of which have two spiracles or breathing pores, one on each side.  It also bears upon the end of the body the ovipositor of the female  or the clasping organs of the male.          BUTTERFLY TRANSFORMATIONS      The butterflies furnish the best known examples of insect  transformations. The change from the egg to the caterpillar or larva,  from the caterpillar to the pupa or chrysalis, and from the chrysalis  to the butterfly or imago is doubtless the most generally known fact  concerning the life histories of insects. It is a typical example of  what are called complete transformations as distinguished from the  manner of growth of grasshoppers, crickets, and many other insects in  which the young that hatches from the egg bears a general resemblance  to the adult and in which there is no quiet chrysalis stage when the  little creature is unable to eat or to move about.       [Illustration: Egg of Baltimore Butterfly, much magnified.       (From Holland)]      _The Growth of the Caterpillars_    Caterpillars are like snakes in at least one respect: in order to  provide for their increase in size they shed their skins. When a  caterpillar hatches from the egg it is a tiny creature with a soft  skin over most of its body but with rather a firm covering for its  head. While we might fancy that there could be a considerable increase  in size provided for by the stretching of the soft skin it is easy to  see that the hard covering of the head will not admit of this. So the  story of the growth of a caterpillar may be told in this way:    A butterfly lays an egg upon a leaf. Some days later the egg hatches  into a larva, which is the technical name for the second stage of an  insect's life. In the case of the butterfly we call this larva a  caterpillar. The little caterpillar is likely to take its first meal  by eating the empty egg shell. This is a curious habit, and a really  satisfactory explanation of it seems not to have been made. Its next  meal is likely to be taken from the green tissues of the leaf,  commonly the green outer surface only being eaten at this time. The  future meals are also taken from the leaf, more and more being eaten  as the larva gets older.    After a few days of this feeding upon the leaf tissues the little  caterpillar becomes so crowded within the skin with which it was born  that it is necessary to have a larger one. So a new skin begins to  form beneath the first one. Consequently the latter splits open in a  straight line part way down the middle of the back just behind the  head. Then the new head covering is withdrawn from the old one and the  caterpillar wriggles its way out of the split skin and finds itself  clothed in a new one. At first all of the tissues of the new skin are  soft and pliable and they easily take on a larger size as the body of  the caterpillar expands. A little later these tissues become hardened  and no further expansion is possible.    This process of skin-shedding is called moulting. The cast skin is  often called the exuviae. The period of the caterpillar's life between  the hatching from the egg and this moult is often called a stage or  instar--that is, the caterpillar up to the time of this moult is  living in the first caterpillar stage or instar.    During the actual moulting the caterpillar is quite active in freeing  itself from the exuviae. But as soon as it is free it is likely to  rest quietly for some hours while the tissues of the new skin are  hardening. Then it begins feeding upon the leaf again and continues  taking its meals at more or less regular intervals for several days.  By that time it will again have reached its limit of growth within  this second skin and the process of moulting must be repeated. It  takes place in the same way as before and the caterpillar enters upon  the third instar of its larval life.    This process of feeding and moulting is continued for several weeks,  the number of moults being usually four. During the later stages the  increase in size is more marked each time the skin is shed, until the  caterpillar finally reaches its full growth as a larva and is ready  for the wonderful change to the quiet chrysalis in which all its  caterpillar organs are to be transformed into the very different  organs of the butterfly.    In the case of butterfly larvae one of the most interesting features  of the growth of the caterpillar is that of the remarkable changes in  colors and patterns of marking which the caterpillar undergoes.
