On various  occasions I have heard _Gastrophryne_ choruses in a slough two miles  south of the Reservation. This slough is in the Kaw River flood plain  and is two miles from the bluffs where the habitat of rocky wooded  slopes begins that has been considered typical of the species in  northeastern Kansas. It seems that the frogs using this slough are not  drawn from the populations living on the bluffs as Mud Creek, a Kaw  River tributary, intervenes. The creek channel at times of heavy  rainfall, carries a torrent of swirling water which might present a  barrier to migrating frogs as they are not strong swimmers. The frogs  could easily find suitable breeding places much nearer to the bluffs.  Those using the slough are almost certainly permanent inhabitants of the  river flood plain. The area in the neighborhood of the slough, where the  frogs probably live, include fields of alfalfa and other cultivated  crops, weedy fallow fields, and the marshy margins of the slough. In  these situations burrows of rodents, notably those of the pocket gopher  (_Geomys bursarius_), would provide subterranean shelter for the frogs,  which are not efficient diggers.    The frogs may live in many situations such as this where they have been  overlooked. In the absence of flat rocks providing hiding places at the  soil surface, the frogs would rarely be found by a collector. The volume  and carrying quality of the voice are much less than in other common  anurans. Large breeding choruses might be overlooked unless the observer  happened to come within a few yards of them. Most of the recorded  habitats and localities of occurrence may be those where the frog  happens to be most in evidence to human observers, rather than those  that are limiting to it or even typical of it.    On September 20, 1954, after heavy rains, juveniles dispersing from  breeding ponds were in a wide variety of situations, including most of  the habitat types represented on the Reservation. Along a small dry  gully in an eroded field formerly cultivated, and reverted to tall  grass prairie (big bluestem, little bluestem, switch grass, Indian  grass), the frogs were numerous. Many of them were flushed by my  footsteps from cracks in the soil along the gully banks. In reaching  this area the frogs had moved up a wooded slope from the pond, crossed  the limestone outcrop area at the hilltop edge, and wandered away from  the woods and rocks, out into the prairie habitat. In this prairie  habitat there were no rocks providing hiding places at the soil surface,  but burrows of the vole (_Microtus ochrogaster_) and other small rodents  provided an abundance of subterranean shelter. In the summer of 1955 the  frogs were seen frequently in this same area, especially when the soil  was wet from recent rain. When the surface of the soil was dry, none  could be found and presumably all stayed in deep cracks and burrows.    Anderson (1954: 17) indicated that _G. carolinensis_ in Louisiana  likewise occurs in diverse habitats, being sufficiently adaptable to  satisfy its basic requirements in various ways.      BEHAVIOR    Ordinarily the ant-eating frog stays beneath the soil surface, in cracks  or holes or beneath rocks. Probably it obtains its food in such  situations, and rarely wanders on the surface. The occasional  individuals found moving about above ground are in most instances  flushed from their shelters by the vibrations of the observer's  footsteps. On numerous occasions I have noticed individuals, startled by  nearby footfalls, dart from cracks or under rocks and scuttle away in  search of other shelter. Such behavior suggests that digging predators  may be important natural enemies. The gait is a combination of running  and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length. The flat  pointed head seems to be in contact with the ground or very near to it  as the animal moves about rapidly and erratically. The frog has a  proclivity for squeezing into holes and cracks, or beneath objects on  the ground. The burst of activity by one that is startled lasts for only  a few seconds. Then the frog stops abruptly, usually concealed wholly or  in part by some object. Having stopped it tends to rely on concealment  for protection and may allow close approach before it flushes again.    Less frequently, undisturbed individuals have been seen wandering on the  soil surface. Such wandering occurs chiefly at night. Diurnal wandering  may occur in relatively cool weather when night temperatures are too low  for the frogs to be active. Wandering above ground is limited to times  when the soil and vegetation are wet, mainly during heavy rains and  immediately afterward.    Pitfalls made from gallon cans buried in the ground with tops open and  flush with the soil surface were installed in 1949 in several places  along hilltop rock outcrops where the frogs were abundant. The number of  frogs caught from day to day under varying weather-conditions provided  evidence as to the factors controlling surface activity. After nights of  unusually heavy rainfall, a dozen frogs, or even several dozen, might be  found in each of the more productive pitfalls. A few more might be  caught on the following night, and occasional stragglers as long as the  soil remained damp with heavy dew. Activity is greatest on hot summer  nights. Below 20 deg. C. there is little surface activity but individuals  that had body temperatures as low as 16 deg. C. have been found moving  about.    Frogs uncovered in their hiding places beneath flat rocks often remained  motionless depending on concealment for protection, but if further  disturbed, they made off with the running and hopping gait already  described. Although they were not swift, they were elusive because of  their sudden changes of direction and the ease with which they found  shelter. When actually grasped, a frog would struggle only momentarily,  then would become limp with its legs extended. The viscous dermal  secretions copiously produced by a frog being handled made the animal so  slippery that after a few seconds it might slide from the captor's  grasp, and always was quick to escape when such an opportunity was  presented.      TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS    Ant-eating frogs are active over a temperature range of at least 16 deg.  C. to 37.6 deg. C. They tolerate high temperatures that would be lethal  to many other kinds of amphibians, but are more sensitive to low  temperatures than any of the other local species, and as a result their  seasonal schedule resembles that of the larger lizards and snakes more  than those of other local amphibians. The latter become active earlier  in the spring.    Earliest recorded dates when the frogs were found active in the course  of the present study from 1950 to 1955 were in April every year; the  20th, 25th, 24th, 2nd, 25th, and 21st. Latest dates when the frogs were  found in the six years of the study were: October 22, 1949; October 13,  1950; October 7, 1951; August 24, 1952; August 18, 1953; and October 27,  1954 (excluding two late stragglers caught in a pitfall on December 5).  Severe drought caused unseasonably early retirement in 1952 and 1953.    Body temperatures of the frogs were taken with a small mercury  thermometer of the type described by Bogert (1949: 197); the bulb was  used to force open the mouth and was thrust down the gullet into the  stomach. To prevent conduction of heat from the hand, the frog was held  down through several layers of cloth, at the spot where it was  discovered, until the temperature reading could be made. This required  approximately five seconds.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Temperatures of ant-eating frogs grouped in  one-degree intervals; upper figure is of frogs found active in the open,  and lower is of those found under shelter. The frogs are active over a  temperature range of more than 20 degrees, and show no clear cut  preference within this range.]    Most of the 79 frogs of which temperatures were measured, were found  under shelter, chiefly beneath flat rocks. The rocks most utilized were  in open situations, exposed to sunshine. Most of the frogs were in  contact with the warmed undersurfaces of such rocks. Forty-three of the  frogs, approximately 54.5 percent, were in the eight-degree range  between 24 deg. and 31 deg. C. Probably the preferred temperatures lie  within this range. The highest body temperature recorded, 37.6 deg. C.,  was in a frog which \"froze\" and remained motionless in the sunshine for  half a minute after the rock sheltering it was overturned. Probably its  temperature was several degrees lower while it was sheltered by the  rock. Other unusually high temperatures were recorded in newly  metamorphosed frogs found hiding in piles of decaying vegetation near  the edge of the pond, on hot afternoons of late August. Temperatures  ranged from 17.0 deg. to 30.7 deg. in frogs that were found actually  moving about. Several with relatively low temperatures, 22 deg. to 17  deg., were juveniles travelling in rain or mist on cool days. These  frogs, having relatively low temperature, were sluggish in their  movements, as compared with individuals at the upper end of the  temperature range.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Body temperatures and nearby air temperatures for  frogs found under natural conditions. Dots represent frogs found under  shelter; circles represent those found in the open.]    After the first frost each year the frogs usually could not be found,  either in the open or in their usual hiding places beneath rocks. They  probably had retired to deep subterranean hibernation sites. The only  exception was in 1954, when two immature frogs were found together in a  pitfall on the morning of December 5 after a rain of .55 inches ending  many weeks of drought. Air temperature had been little above 10 deg.

He made his appearance only at meal-times, and then paid but little  attention to what was going on around him, although he was kind to his  children in a gentle indifferent sort of way. For many years he had been  engaged in making up his mind as to the school to which Wilfrid should  be sent; and the boy had at first only been sent to the grammar-school  at the suggestion of his mother as a temporary measure until the  important decision should be arrived at. This had been six years before,  and Mr. Renshaw had postponed his decision until it was too late for  Wilfrid to enter at any of the great public schools.    Knowing from long experience what would be the result were he consulted  as to Marion's education, Mrs. Renshaw had, when the girl was nine years  old, engaged a governess for her without any previous consultation with  her husband, simply telling him of the arrangement after it was  concluded, saying: \"I know, Alfred, that you have not yet decided  whether an education at home or at school is best for a girl, and I have  consequently arranged with a young lady to come as governess until you  can come to a conclusion upon the point.\"    Wilfrid Renshaw was extremely fond of his mother. His father he regarded  with a somewhat contemptuous kind of affection. He did not doubt that he  was a very learned man, but he had small patience with his inability to  make up his mind, his total want of energy, and his habit of leaving  everything for his wife to decide upon and carry out.    \"It would do father an immense deal of good if something were to happen  that would wake him up a bit and get him to take an interest in things,\"  he had said over and over again to Marion. \"I cannot understand a man  having no opinion of his own about anything.\"    \"I do not think you ought to speak in that sort of way, Wil, about  father.\"    \"Oh, that is all nonsense, Marion. One cannot be blind about a person  even if he is one's own father. Of course he is very kind and very  indulgent, but it would be very much pleasanter if he were so because he  wished to give us pleasure, instead of because it is the easiest thing  to do. I should be downright pleased if sometimes when I ask him for  anything he would say positively I could not have it.\"    Now the something that Wilfrid had hoped might occur to rouse his father  had taken place, and had come in a form very unpleasantly violent and  unexpected. The papers a week before had brought the news of the failure  of the bank in which the greater portion of Mr. Renshaw's property was  invested, and a letter had the following morning been received from a  brother of Mrs. Renshaw, who was also a shareholder in the bank, saying  that the liabilities were very large, and that the shareholders would  undoubtedly be called upon to pay even their last penny to make up the  deficiency. This news had been confirmed, and there could be no doubt  absolute ruin had fallen upon them.    Mr. Renshaw had been completely overwhelmed by the tidings, and had  taken to his bed. Wilfrid's holidays had begun a few days before, and  his mother at once acquainted him with the misfortune that had befallen  them, and she now told him that the calls that would be made upon the  shares would more than swallow up the rest of their fortune.    \"There will be absolutely nothing remaining, Wilfrid, except a thousand  pounds that I had at my marriage, and which were fortunately settled  upon me. This cannot be touched. Everything else will have to go.\"    \"Well, it's a bad business, mother. I will go for a walk and think it  over. Marion, put on your hat and come out with me.\"    They had been for their walk--a long one, and he was now expressing the  result at which they had arrived.    \"One thing is certain--something has got to be done.\"    \"Yes,\" Mrs. Renshaw replied with a faint smile. \"The question is, What  is it?\"    \"Well, mother, it is quite certain that we four cannot live on the  interest of a thousand pounds unless we go into a hovel and live on  bread and water.\"    \"I quite see that, Wilfrid; but I am sure I do not see how we are to  earn money. It is far too late for your father to go back to the bar  now, and it might be years before he got a brief. At any rate, we could  not afford to live in London till he does so. I have been thinking I  might open a little school somewhere.\"    [Illustration: Sketch Map of WAIROA AND POVERTY BAY DISTRICTS NORTH  ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND]    The boy waved his hand.    \"No, mother, you are not going to take us all on to your shoulders. You  have got to look after father; that will be a full share of the work, I  am sure. Marion and I have been talking it over, and the only possible  thing we can see is for us to emigrate.\"    \"To emigrate!\" Mrs. Renshaw repeated in astonishment. \"Why, my dear boy,  what should we be fit for in the colonies more than here?\"    \"A good deal, mother. A thousand pounds is nothing here, and it would be  a good deal out there. It would be horrible to come down to live in a  little cottage like working people here, after living like this; but it  would be nothing out there. We could buy land for next to nothing in New  Zealand, and could employ a couple of men to work with me to clear it  and cultivate it; and get a few cows and sheep to start with, and still  have a little money in hand. You and Marion could look after things  indoors; I should look after things out of doors.\"    \"You don't seem to count your father at all,\" Mrs. Renshaw said a little  reproachfully.    \"No, mother, I don't,\" Wilfrid said bluntly. \"You know as well as I do  that father would be of no use to speak of in a life like that. Still, I  think he could make himself happy out there as well as here. He could  take all his books with him, and could inquire into the manners and  customs of the natives, who are every bit as good as the ancient  Britons; better, I should say. But whatever we do, mother, whether it is  here or anywhere else, we must settle upon it and do it. Of course we  must consult him; but we must quite make up our minds before we do so.  If you wait a few weeks for father to make up his mind what we had  better do, we shall wait till this thousand pounds is spent and there is  nothing to do but to go into the workhouse.    \"I am sure that my plan is the best for us. I am as strong as a great  many men; and anyhow, out there, there ought to be no fear about our  keeping ourselves. I have no doubt that when we get out there father  will be able to help in many ways, though I do not know at present what  they are. Anyhow, we shall have a house to live in, even if it is only a  log hut, and I have no doubt have plenty to eat and drink; and that is  more than we shall do if we stay here. I could not earn anything to  speak of here: the most I could expect to get would be ten shillings a  week as an office-boy. And as to your idea of a school, you might be  years before you got pupils; and, besides, when there are two men in a  family it would be shameful to depend upon a woman to keep them.\"    \"Why do you think of New Zealand more than Canada, Wil?\"    \"Because, in the first place, the climate is a great deal pleasanter,  and, in the second place, I believe that as the passage-money is higher  the emigrants are of a better class, and we are likely to have more  pleasant neighbours--people that you and father can associate with--than  we should have if we went to a backwood clearing in Canada. Tom Fairfax  has an uncle in New Zealand, and I have heard him say there are lots of  officers in the army and people of that sort who have settled there. Of  course I know it is going to be hard work, and that it will be very  rough for you and father when we land at first, but I expect it will be  better after a time; and anyhow, mother, I do not think we can starve  there, and I feel sure that it will come to that if we stop here. At any  rate, you had better think it over.    \"Of course if you hit on anything better I shall be ready to agree at  once; but whatever it is we must quite make up our minds together and  then tell father. But when we do tell him we shall have to say that we  are quite convinced that the plan we have fixed on is the only one that  offers a hope of success. Of course I do not expect that he will see it  as we do, but if we put it that if he can suggest anything better to be  done we will set about it at once, I think he's pretty certain to let  things go on as we arrange. I do not mean to speak disrespectfully of  father,\" he went on seeing that his mother's face was a little clouded  \"but you know, mother, that people who are learned, scientific, and all  that sort of thing are very often bad hands at everyday matters. Sir  Isaac Newton, and lots of other fellows I have read about, were like  that; and though father is a splendid hand at anything to do with the  Britons or Danes, and can tell you the story of every old ruin in the  kingdom, he is no good about practical matters. So that we take all the  trouble off his hands, I think he will be quite ready to agree to do  whatever you think is the best. At any rate, mother, I think my plan is  well worth thinking over, and the sooner we make up our minds the  better; after all it is a great thing having something to look forward  to and plan about.\"    Three or four days later Mrs. Renshaw told Wilfrid that think as she  would she could see no better plan for utilizing her little capital than  for them to emigrate.    \"It is putting great responsibility on your shoulders, my boy,\" she  said; \"for I do not disguise from myself that it is upon you that we  must principally depend. Still you will be sixteen by"]]]
