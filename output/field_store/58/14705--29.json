Brigham Young was born at Whitingham, Windham County, Vermont, June 1,  1801. A short sketch of the family of this noted adventurer may not be  uninteresting. The following extract is from his autobiography:--         \"My grandfather, John Young, was a physician and surgeon in       the French and Indian war.         \"My father, John Young, was born March 7, 1763, in Hopkinton,       Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He was very circumspect,       exemplary and religious, and was, from an early period of his       life, a member of the Methodist Church. At the age of sixteen       he enlisted in the American Revolutionary War, and served       under General Washington; he was in three campaigns in his own       native State, and in New Jersey. In the year 1785 he married       Nabby Howe, daughter of Phineas and Susannah, whose maiden       name was Goddard.         \"In January, 1801, he moved from Hopkinton to Whitingham,       Windham County, Vermont, where he remained for three years,       opening new farms.         \"He moved from Vermont to Sherburn, Chenango County, New York,       in 1804, where he followed farming, enduring many hardships       and privations, incidental to new settlements.         \"My father's family consisted of five sons and six daughters,       viz.:--         \"Nancy, born in Hopkinton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts,       August 6, 1786.         \"Fanny, born in the same place, November 8, 1787.         \"Rhoda, born in Platauva District, New York, September 10,       1789.         \"John, born in Hopkinton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, May       22, 1791.         \"Nabby, born in same place, April 23, 1793.         \"Susannah, born in same place, June 7, 1795.         \"Joseph, born in the same place, April 7, 1797.         \"Phineas Howe, born in same place, February 16, 1799.         \"Brigham, born in Whitingham, Windham County, Vermont, June 1,       1801.         \"Louisa, born in Sherburn, Chenango County, New York,       September 25, 1804.         \"Lorenzo Dow, born in same place, October 19, 1807.\"    It is worthy of remark, that all of Brigham's family became Mormons. His  father, John Young, was constituted first patriarch of the church, and  died at Quincy, Illinois, October 12, 1839. His brothers are all at Salt  Lake, and are the devoted followers and satellites of the Prophet.    Through the plurality system, the Youngs have formed connections so  numerous, that almost half the people at Salt Lake are in some way  related to the ruling dynasty. This is striking evidence of Brigham's  ingenuity in consolidating and perpetuating his power.    His early life was that of a farmer's son, but he afterwards acquired  the trade of a painter and glazier, which he followed until his  conversion to Mormonism. In 1832, being then thirty-one years of age, he  heard and embraced this new religion. He was convinced by Samuel H.  Smith, brother to the prophet Joseph, and was baptized by Eleazer  Miller, now living at Salt Lake.    Brigham \"gathered\" with the saints, at Kirtland, Ohio, and soon became  intimate with Joseph Smith. He was ordained an elder, and began  preaching. His shrewdness, and almost intuitive knowledge of character,  soon attracted the attention of his brethren, and gave him influence and  position in this weak and despised church. They recognized in him a man  born to rule and lead the masses. They were attracted by his strong,  electrical will; and from that time his power in the church has been  undisputed.    In 1835, on the 14th of February, at Kirtland, Brigham Young was  ordained one of the newly-organized quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Armed  with his new power, and fired with a zeal worthy of a better cause, he  went forth, and preached and proselyted with marked success.    Thomas B. Marsh having apostatized, Brigham was chosen to succeed him,  as President of the Twelve Apostles, in 1836.    Then came the dark days of Mormonism. Many of the prominent men of the  church apostatized. The saints were driven from Kirtland. Smith fled to  save his life; Brigham accompanied him, and after many hair-breadth  escapes, many trials and hardships, they again planted a new colony, and  settled in Far West, Missouri.    But the saints were destined again to endure persecution for their  faith. In a few years they were driven from Missouri, seeking a home  this time in Illinois. During all this time Brigham stood firm,  counselling and directing his brethren, and, like the rock amid the  storms, gathering fresh power of resistance as the waves of persecution  increased in fury.    In 1839 he was appointed, with others, to \"open up the gospel\" to the  inhabitants of the British Isles. They landed at Liverpool on the 6th of  April, 1840, and immediately commenced preaching. Brigham superintended  affairs, issued an edition of the \"Book of Mormon,\" and commenced the  publication of the \"Millennial Star,\" a periodical still living. In 1841  he sailed for New York, having shipped seven hundred and sixty-nine of  the faithful, and leaving many churches, with organizations completed.    Brigham was cordially received by Smith, and the saints generally, who  appreciated and acknowledged his services, and it was evident that his  influence and fame were rapidly increasing.    In 1844 the whole aspect of affairs was changed. Smith was shot, Nauvoo  threatened by a mob, and the Twelve Apostles scattered. Sidney Rigdon  assumed the Presidency, he being Smith's first counsellor. Divisions  were numerous, and the church was in imminent danger of falling into  hopeless ruin.    Brigham, with true Napoleonic foresight, saw his opportunity, and was  not slow to improve it. He came hurriedly to Nauvoo, denounced Rigdon as  an impostor and his revelations as emanations from the Devil, cut off  both him and his adherents from the true church, cursed Rigdon, and  \"handed him over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand years,\" and  was himself elected President by an overwhelming majority.    This exhibition of energy silenced all opposition. Those who did not  love, feared him; and all suffered themselves to be led, because they  dared not resist, a man so determined to rule.    Thus much accomplished, and visions of future power and aggrandizement,  perchance of temporal sovereignty, floated through the brain of this  modern Mohammed. He dreamed of the kingly robe and the jewelled crown in  some far-off valley of the Rocky Mountains, where gentiles or their laws  could not annoy the saints, or hinder the normal development of  Mormonism. How and in what manner these dreams came so near fulfilment,  will be seen as the reader peruses these pages.    But he did not lose sight of the present in these glowing visions of the  future. He completed the Temple, the Mansion-House was in a forward  state, Nauvoo was increasing rapidly, and with it his power and  popularity.    Brigham, however, with his usual foresight, saw the storm arising. The  saints were again to be driven. So he hurried the people through their  endowments, bound them to him by oaths which made them shudder to  recall, and still, by an art equal to that of Loyola, so inwound himself  in their affections that they loved and reverenced him the more. He  aroused their deepest hatred toward the \"gentiles;\" wrought upon their  pride, ambition, and revenge, until they were ready to do and dare  anything for their religion and their leader. When his power was thus  fully established, he revealed to them \"the will of the Lord concerning  them.\" They must leave their beautiful Nauvoo, their sacred temple,  their altars and their homes, and follow him as the Moses of the new  dispensation, and he would find for them a Canaan, a land flowing with  milk and honey, where the gentiles should never come. This was a trial  of their faith. Should they yield to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#2)"],[1,"end.  Here is a man, possessing many of those qualities which go to make the  successful man of action in all walks of life, driven by circumstances  to squander them on a criminal career. Yet it is a curious circumstance  that this determined and ruthless burglar should have suffered for what  would be classed in France as a \"crime passionel.\" There is more than  a possibility that a French jury would have found extenuating circumstances in the murder of Dyson. The fate of Peace is only another instance of the wrecking a strong man's career by his passion for a woman. In Albert Butler we have the criminal by conviction, a conviction which finds the ground ready prepared  for its growth in the natural laziness and idleness of the man's  disposition. The desire to acquire things by a short cut, without taking  the trouble to work for them honestly, is perhaps the most fruitful of  all sources of crime. Butler, a bit of a pedant, is pleased to  justify his conduct by reason and philosophy--he finds in the acts of  unscrupulous monarchs an analogy to his own attitude towards life. What  is good enough for Caesar Borgia is good enough for Robert Butler. Like  Borgia he comes to grief; criminals succeed and criminals fail. In the  case of historical criminals their crimes are open; we can estimate the  successes and failures. With ordinary criminals, we know only those  who fail. The successful, the real geniuses in crime, those whose guilt  remains undiscovered, are for the most part unknown to us. Occasionally  in society a man or woman is pointed out as having once murdered  somebody or other, and at times, no doubt, with truth. But the matter  can only be referred to clandestinely; they are gazed at with awe or  curiosity, mute witnesses to their own achievement. Some years ago James  Payn, the novelist, hazarded the reckoning that one person in every five  hundred was an undiscovered murderer. This gives us all a hope, almost  a certainty, that we may reckon one such person at least among our  acquaintances.(1)           (1) The author was one of three men discussing this subject in a London  club. They were able to name six persons of their various acquaintance  who were, or had been, suspected of being successful murderers.      Derues is remarkable for the extent of his social ambition, the daring  and impudent character of his attempts to gratify it, the skill, the  consummate hypocrisy with which he played on the credulity of honest  folk, and his flagrant employment of that weapon known and recognised  to-day in the most exalted spheres by the expressive name of \"bluff.\"  He is remarkable, too, for his mirth and high spirits, his genial  buffoonery; the merry murderer is a rare bird.    Professor Webster belongs to that order of criminal of which Eugene Aram  and the Rev. John Selby Watson are our English examples, men of culture  and studious habits who suddenly burst on the astonished gaze of  their fellowmen as murderers. The exact process of mind by which these  hitherto harmless citizens are converted into assassins is to a great  extent hidden from us.    Perhaps Webster's case is the clearest of the three. Here we have a  selfish, self-indulgent and spendthrift gentleman who has landed himself  in serious financial embarrassment, seeking by murder to escape from an  importunate and relentless creditor. He has not, apparently, the moral  courage to face the consequences of his own weakness. He forgets the  happiness of his home, the love of those dear to him, in the desire to  free himself from a disgrace insignificent{sic} in comparison with that  entailed by committing the highest of all crimes. One would wish to  believe that Webster's deed was unpremeditated, the result of a sudden  gust of passion caused by his victim's acrimonious pursuit of his  debtor. But there are circumstances in the case which tell powerfully  against such a view. The character of the murderer seems curiously  contradictory; both cunning and simplicity mark his proceedings; he  makes a determined attempt to escape from the horrors of his situation  and shows at the same time a curious insensibility to its real gravity.  Webster was a man of refined tastes and seemingly gentle character,  loved by those near to him, well liked by his friends.    The mystery that surrounds the real character of Eugene Aram is greater,  and we possess little or no means of solving it. From what motive this  silent, arrogant man, despising his ineffectual wife, this reserved and  moody scholar stooped to fraud and murder the facts of the case help us  little to determine. Was it the hope of leaving the narrow surroundings  of Knaresborough, his tiresome belongings, his own poor way of life,  and seeking a wider field for the exercise of those gifts of scholarship  which he undoubtedly possessed that drove him to commit fraud in company  with Clark and Houseman, and then, with the help of the latter,  murder the unsuspecting Clark? The fact of his humble origin makes  his association with so low a ruffian as Houseman the less remarkable.  Vanity in all probability played a considerable part in Aram's  disposition. He would seem to have thought himself a superior person,  above the laws that bind ordinary men. He showed at the end no  consciousness of his guilt. Being something of a philosopher, he had  no doubt constructed for himself a philosophy of life which served to  justify his own actions. He was a deist, believing in \"one almighty  Being the God of Nature,\" to whom he recommended himself at the last in  the event of his \"having done amiss.\" He emphasised the fact that his  life had been unpolluted and his morals irreproachable. But his views  as to the murder of Clark he left unexpressed. He suggested as  justification of it that Clark had carried on an intrigue with his  neglected wife, but he never urged this circumstance in his defence, and  beyond his own statement there is no evidence of such a connection.    The Revd. John Selby Watson, headmaster of the Stockwell Grammar School,  at the age of sixty-five killed his wife in his library one Sunday  afternoon. Things had been going badly with the unfortunate man. After  more than twenty-five years' service as headmaster of the school at a  meagre salary of L400 a year, he was about to be dismissed; the  number of scholars had been declining steadily and a change in the  headmastership thought necessary; there was no suggestion of his  receiving any kind of pension. The future for a man of his years  was dark enough. The author of several learned books, painstaking,  scholarly, dull, he could hope to make but little money from literary  work. Under a cold, reserved and silent exterior, Selby Watson concealed  a violence of temper which he sought diligently to repress. His wife's  temper was none of the best. Worried, depressed, hopeless of his future,  he in all probability killed his wife in a sudden access of rage,  provoked by some taunt or reproach on her part, and then, instead of  calling in a policeman and telling him what he had done, made clumsy and  ineffectual efforts to conceal his crime. Medical opinion was divided as  to his mental condition. Those doctors called for the prosecution could  find no trace of insanity about him, those called for the defence said  that he was suffering from melancholia. The unhappy man would appear  hardly to have realised the gravity of his situation. To a friend who  visited him in prison he said: \"Here's a man who can write Latin, which  the Bishop of Winchester would commend, shut up in a place like this.\"  Coming from a man who had spent all his life buried in books and knowing  little of the world the remark is not so greatly to be wondered at.  Profound scholars are apt to be impatient of mundane things. Professor  Webster showed a similar want of appreciation of the circumstances of a  person charged with wilful murder. Selby Watson was convicted of murder  and sentenced to death. The sentence was afterwards commuted to one of  penal servitude for life, the Home Secretary of the day showing by  his decision that, though not satisfied of the prisoner's insanity, he  recognised certain extenuating circumstances in his guilt.(2)           (2) Selby Watson was tried at the Central Criminal Court January, 1872.      In Castaing much ingenuity is shown in the conception of the crime,  but the man is weak and timid; he is not the stuff of which the great  criminal is made; Holmes is cast in the true mould of the instinctive  murderer. Castaing is a man of sensibility, capable of domestic  affection; Holmes completely insensible to all feelings of humanity.  Taking life is a mere incident in the accomplishment of his schemes;  men, women and children are sacrificed with equal mercilessness to the  necessary end. A consummate liar and hypocrite, he has that strange  power of fascination over others, women in particular, which is often  independent altogether of moral or even physical attractiveness. We  are accustomed to look for a certain vastness, grandeur of scale in the  achievements of America. A study of American crime will show that it  does not disappoint us in this expectation. The extent and audacity of  the crimes of Holmes are proof of it.    To find a counterpart in imaginative literature to the complete criminal  of the Holmes type we must turn to the pages of Shakespeare. In the  number of his victims, the cruelty and insensibility with which he  attains his ends, his unblushing hypocrisy, the fascination he can  exercise at will over others, the Richard III. of Shakespeare shows how  clearly the poet understood the instinctive criminal of real life. The  Richard of history was no doubt less instinctively and deliberately an  assassin than the Richard of Shakespeare. In the former we can trace  the gradual temptation to crime to which circumstances provoke him. The  murder of the Princes, if, as one writer contends, it"]]]
