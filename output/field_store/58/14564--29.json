Since then I  have re-investigated the whole problem of the Celtic belief in Fairies,  and have collected very much fresh material. Two years ago the scope of  my original research was limited to the four chief Celtic countries, but  now it includes all of the Celtic countries.    In the present study, which has profited greatly by criticisms of the  first passed by scholars in Britain and in France, the original literary  point of view is combined with the broader point of view of  anthropology. This study, the final and more comprehensive form of my  views about the 'Fairy-Faith', would never have been possible had I not  enjoyed during many months the kindly advice and constant encouragement  of Mr. R. R. Marett, Reader in Social Anthropology in the University of  Oxford, and Fellow of Exeter College.    During May 1910 the substance of this essay in its pan-Celtic form was  submitted to the Board of the Faculty of Natural Science of Oxford  University for the Research Degree of Bachelor of Science, which was  duly granted. But the present work contains considerable material not  contained in the essay presented to the Oxford examiners, the Right Hon.  Sir John Rhys and Mr. Andrew Lang; and, therefore, I alone assume  entire responsibility for all its possible shortcomings, and in  particular for some of its more speculative theories, which to some  minds may appear to be in conflict with orthodox views, whether of the  theologian or of the man of science. These theories, however venturesome  they may appear, are put forth in almost every case with the full  approval of some reliable, scholarly Celt; and as such they are chiefly  intended to make the exposition of the belief in fairies as completely  and as truly Celtic as possible, without much regard for non-Celtic  opinion, whether this be in harmony with Celtic opinion or not.    As the new manuscript of the 'Fairy-Faith' lies before me revised and  finished, I realize even more fully than I did two years ago with  respect to the original study, how little right I have to call it mine.  Those to whom the credit for it really belongs are my many kind friends  and helpers in Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall, and  Brittany, and many others who are not Celts, in the three great  nations--happily so intimately united now by unbreakable bonds of  goodwill and international brotherhood--Britain, France, and the United  States of America; for without the aid of all these Celtic and  non-Celtic friends the work could never have been accomplished. They  have given me their best and rarest thoughts as so many golden threads;  I have only furnished the mental loom, and woven these golden threads  together in my own way according to what I take to be the psychological  pattern of the Fairy-Faith.    I am under a special obligation to the following six distinguished  Celtic scholars who have contributed, for my second chapter, the six  introductions to the fairy-lore collected by me in their respective  countries:--Dr. Douglas Hyde (Ireland); Dr. Alexander Carmichael  (Scotland); Miss Sophia Morrison (Isle of Man); the Right Hon. Sir John  Rhys (Wales); Mr. Henry Jenner (Cornwall); Professor Anatole Le Braz  (Brittany).    I am also greatly indebted to the Rev. J. Estlin Carpenter, Principal of  Manchester College, for having aided me with the parts of this book  touching Christian theology; to Mr. R. I. Best, M.R.I.A., Assistant  Librarian, National Library, Dublin, for having aided me with the parts  devoted to Irish mythology and literature; and to Mr. William McDougall,  Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy in the University of Oxford, for a  similar service with respect to Section IV, entitled 'Science and  Fairies'. And to these and to all the other scholars whose names appear  in this preface, my heartiest thanks are due for the assistance which  they have so kindly rendered in reading different parts of the  _Fairy-Faith_ when in proof.    With the deep spirit of reverence which a student feels towards his  preceptors, I acknowledge a still greater debt to those among my friends  and helpers who have been my Celtic guides and teachers. Here in Oxford  University I have run up a long account with the Right Hon. Sir John  Rhys, the Professor of Celtic, who has introduced me to the study of  Modern Irish, and of Arthurian romance and mythology, and has guided me  both during the year 1907-8 and ever since in Celtic folk-lore  generally. To Mr. Andrew Lang, I am likewise a debtor, more especially  in view of the important suggestions which he has given me during the  past two years with respect to anthropology and to psychical research.  In my relation to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Rennes, I  shall always remember the friendly individual assistance offered to me  there during the year 1908-9 by Professor Joseph Loth, then Dean in that  University, but now of the College of France, in Paris, particularly  with respect to Brythonic mythology, philology, and archaeology; by  Professor Georges Dottin, particularly with respect to Gaelic matters;  and by Professor Anatole Le Braz, whose continual good wishes towards my  work have been a constant source of inspiration since our first meeting  during March 1908, especially in my investigation of _La Legende de la  Mort_, and of the related traditions and living folk-beliefs in  Brittany--Brittany with its haunted ground of Carnac, home of the  ancient Brythonic Mysteries.    W. Y. E. W.      JESUS COLLEGE, OXFORD.      _All Saints' Day_, 1911.          'There, neither turmoil nor silence....    'Though fair the sight of Erin's plains, hardly will they seem so after  you have known the Great Plain....    'A wonder of a land the land of which I speak; no youth there grows to  old age....    'We behold and are not beheld.'--The God Midir, in _Tochmarc Etaine_.          INTRODUCTION         'I have told what I have seen, what I have thought, and what I have       learned by inquiry.'--HERODOTUS.      I. THE RELIGIOUS NATURE OF THE FAIRY-FAITH    There is probably no other place in Celtic lands more congenial, or more  inspiring for the writing down of one's deeper intuitions about the  Fairy-Faith, than Carnac, under the shadow of the pagan tumulus and  mount of the sacred fire, now dedicated by triumphant Christianity to  the Archangel Michael. The very name of Carnac is significant;[1] and in  two continents, Africa and Europe--to follow the certain evidence of  archaeology alone[2]--there seem to have been no greater centres for  ancient religion than Karnak in Egypt and Carnac in Brittany. On the  banks of the Nile the Children of Isis and Osiris erected temples as  perfect as human art can make them; on the shores of the Morbihan the  mighty men who were, as it seems, the teachers of our own Celtic  forefathers, erected temples of unhewn stone. The wonderful temples in  Yucatan, the temple-caves of prehistoric India, Stonehenge in England,  the Parthenon, the Acropolis, St. Peter's at Rome, Westminster Abbey, or  Notre-Dame, and the Pyramids and temples of Egypt, equally with the  Alignements of Carnac, each in their own way record more or less  perfectly man's attempt to express materially what he feels spiritually.  Perfected art can beautify and make more attractive to the eye and mind,  but it cannot enhance in any degree the innate spiritual ideals which  men in all ages have held; and thus it is that we read amid the rough  stone menhirs and dolmens in Brittany, as amid the polished granite  monoliths and magnificent temples in Egypt, the same silent message from  the past to the present, from the dead to the living. This message, we  think, is fundamentally important in understanding the Celtic  Fairy-Faith; for in our opinion the belief in fairies has the same  origin as all religions and mythologies.    And there seems never to have been an uncivilized tribe, a race, or  nation of civilized men who have not had some form of belief in an  unseen world, peopled by unseen beings. In religions, mythologies, and  the Fairy-Faith, too, we behold the attempts which have been made by  different peoples in different ages to explain in terms of human  experience this unseen world, its inhabitants, its laws, and man's  relation to it. The Ancients called its inhabitants gods, genii,  daemons, and shades; Christianity knows them as angels, saints, demons,  and souls of the dead; to uncivilized tribes they are gods, demons, and  spirits of ancestors; and the Celts think of them as gods, and as  fairies of many kinds.      II. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FAIRY-FAITH    By the Celtic Fairy-Faith we mean that specialized form of belief in a  spiritual realm inhabited by spiritual beings which has existed from  prehistoric times until now in Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man, Wales,  Cornwall, Brittany, or other parts of the ancient empire of the Celts.  In studying this belief, we are concerned directly with living Celtic  folk-traditions, and with past Celtic folk-traditions as recorded in  literature. And if fairies actually exist as invisible beings or  intelligences, and our investigations lead us to the tentative  hypothesis that they do, they are natural and not supernatural, for  nothing which exists can be supernatural; and, therefore, it is our duty  to examine the Celtic Fairy Races just as we examine any fact in the  visible realm wherein we now live, whether it be a fact of chemistry,  of physics, or of biology. However, as we proceed to make such an  examination, we shall have to remember constantly that there is a new  set of ideas to work with, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#2)"],[1,"hildhood, whenever I rode in a train, I thought of  that poor runaway slave escaping from the pursuing monster.    These stories, with the bazaars and the relief funds and subscriptions  of which I heard so much talk, I am sure made a permanent impression on  my brain and my character. They awakened in me the two sets of  sensations to which all my life I have most readily responded: first,  admiration for that spirit of fighting and heroic sacrifice by which  alone the soul of civilisation is saved; and next after that,  appreciation of the gentler spirit which is moved to mend and repair the  ravages of war.    I do not remember a time when I could not read, nor any time when  reading was not a joy and a solace. As far back as my memory runs I  loved tales, especially those of a romantic and idealistic character.  \"Pilgrim's Progress\" was an early favourite, as well as another of  Bunyan's visionary romances, which does not seem to be as well known,  his \"Holy War.\" At nine I discovered the Odyssey and very soon after  that another classic which has remained all my life a source of  inspiration. This was Carlyle's \"French Revolution,\" and I received it  with much the same emotion that Keats experienced when he read Chapman's  translation of Homer--\" ... like some watcher of the skies, When a new  planet swims into his ken.\"    I never lost that first impression, and it strongly affected my attitude  toward events which were occurring around my childhood. Manchester is a  city which has witnessed a great many stirring episodes, especially of a  political character. Generally speaking, its citizens have been liberal  in their sentiments, defenders of free speech and liberty of opinion. In  the late sixties there occurred in Manchester one of those dreadful  events that prove an exception to the rule. This was in connection with  the Fenian Revolt in Ireland. There was a Fenian riot, and the police  arrested the leaders. These men were being taken to the jail in a prison  van. On the way the van was stopped and an attempt was made to rescue  the prisoners. A man fired a pistol, endeavouring to break the lock of  the van door. A policeman fell, mortally wounded, and several men were  arrested and were charged with murder. I distinctly remember the riot,  which I did not witness, but which I heard vividly described by my older  brother. I had been spending the afternoon with a young playmate, and my  brother had come after tea to escort me home. As we walked through the  deepening November twilight he talked excitedly of the riot, the fatal  pistol shot, and the slain policeman. I could almost see the man  bleeding on the ground, while the crowd swayed and groaned around him.    The rest of the story reveals one of those ghastly blunders which  justice not infrequently makes. Although the shooting was done without  any intent to kill, the men were tried for murder and three of them were  found guilty and hanged. Their execution, which greatly excited the  citizens of Manchester, was almost the last, if not the last, public  execution permitted to take place in the city. At the time I was a  boarding-pupil in a school near Manchester, and I spent my week-ends at  home. A certain Saturday afternoon stands out in my memory, as on my way  home from school I passed the prison where I knew the men had been  confined. I saw that a part of the prison wall had been torn away, and  in the great gap that remained were evidences of a gallows recently  removed. I was transfixed with horror, and over me there swept the  sudden conviction that that hanging was a mistake--worse, a crime. It  was my awakening to one of the most terrible facts of life--that justice  and judgment lie often a world apart.    I relate this incident of my formative years to illustrate the fact that  the impressions of childhood often have more to do with character and  future conduct than heredity or education. I tell it also to show that  my development into an advocate of militancy was largely a sympathetic  process. I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the  bitterness and sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realisation  of social injustice. My childhood was protected by love and a  comfortable home. Yet, while still a very young child, I began  instinctively to feel that there was something lacking, even in my own  home, some false conception of family relations, some incomplete ideal.    This vague feeling of mine began to shape itself into conviction about  the time my brothers and I were sent to school. The education of the  English boy, then as now, was considered a much more serious matter than  the education of the English boy's sister. My parents, especially my  father, discussed the question of my brothers' education as a matter of  real importance. My education and that of my sister were scarcely  discussed at all. Of course we went to a carefully selected girls'  school, but beyond the facts that the head mistress was a gentlewoman  and that all the pupils were girls of my own class, nobody seemed  concerned. A girl's education at that time seemed to have for its prime  object the art of \"making home attractive\"--presumably to migratory male  relatives. It used to puzzle me to understand why I was under such a  particular obligation to make home attractive to my brothers. We were on  excellent terms of friendship, but it was never suggested to them as a  duty that they make home attractive to me. Why not? Nobody seemed to  know.    The answer to these puzzling questions came to me unexpectedly one night  when I lay in my little bed waiting for sleep to overtake me. It was a  custom of my father and mother to make the round of our bedrooms every  night before going themselves to bed. When they entered my room that  night I was still awake, but for some reason I chose to feign slumber.  My father bent over me, shielding the candle flame with his big hand. I  cannot know exactly what thought was in his mind as he gazed down at me,  but I heard him say, somewhat sadly, \"What a pity she wasn't born a  lad.\"    My first hot impulse was to sit up in bed and protest that I didn't want  to be a boy, but I lay still and heard my parents' footsteps pass on  toward the next child's bed. I thought about my father's remark for many  days afterward, but I think I never decided that I regretted my sex.  However, it was made quite clear that men considered themselves superior  to women, and that women apparently acquiesced in that belief.    I found this view of things difficult to reconcile with the fact that  both my father and my mother were advocates of equal suffrage. I was  very young when the Reform Act of 1866 was passed, but I very well  remember the agitation caused by certain circumstances attending it.  This Reform Act, known as the Household Franchise Bill, marked the first  popular extension of the ballot in England since 1832. Under its terms,  householders paying a minimum of ten pounds a year rental were given the  Parliamentary vote. While it was still under discussion in the House of  Commons, John Stuart Mill moved an amendment to the bill to include  women householders as well as men. The amendment was defeated, but in  the act as passed the word \"man,\" instead of the usual \"male person,\"  was used. Now, under another act of Parliament it had been decided that  the word \"man\" always included \"woman\" unless otherwise specifically  stated. For example, in certain acts containing rate-paying clauses, the  masculine noun and pronoun are used throughout, but the provisions apply  to women rate-payers as well as to men. So when the Reform Bill with the  word \"man\" in it became law, many women believed that the right of  suffrage had actually been bestowed upon them. A tremendous amount of  discussion ensued, and the matter was finally tested by a large number  of women seeking to have their names placed upon the register as voters.  In my city of Manchester 3,924 women, out of a total of 4,215 possible  women voters, claimed their votes, and their claim was defended in the  law courts by eminent lawyers, including my future husband, Dr.  Pankhurst. Of course the women's claim was settled adversely in the  courts, but the agitation resulted in a strengthening of the  woman-suffrage agitation all over the country.    I was too young to understand the precise nature of the affair, but I  shared in the general excitement. From reading newspapers aloud to my  father I had developed a genuine interest in politics, and the Reform  Bill presented itself to my young intelligence as something that was  going to do the most wonderful good to the country. The first election  after the bill became law was naturally a memorable occasion. It is  chiefly memorable to me because it was the first one in which I ever  participated. My sister and I had just been presented with new winter  frocks, green in colour, and made alike, after the custom of proper  British families. Every girl child in those days wore a red flannel  petticoat, and when we first put on our new frocks I was struck with the  fact that we were wearing red and green--the colours of the Liberal  party. Since our father was a Liberal, of course the Liberal party ought  to carry the election, and I conceived a brilliant scheme for helping  its progress. With my small sister trotting after me, I walked the  better part of a mile to the nearest polling-booth. It happened to be in  a rather rough factory district, but we did not notice that. Arrived  there, we two children picked up our green skirts to show our scarlet  petticoats, and brimful of importance, walked up and down before the  assembled crowds to encourage the Liberal vote. From this eminence we  were shortly snatched by outraged authority in the form of a  nursery-maid. I believe we were sent to bed into the bargain, but I am  not entirely clear on this point.    I was fourteen years old when I went to my "]]]
