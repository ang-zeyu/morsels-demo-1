[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4763"],[0,"The Game of Logic (#2)"],[1,"for saying \"there are SOME Cakes here\").  Also let us agree  that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'EMPTY',  that is that there are NO Cakes in it.  In the following Diagrams,  I shall put '1' (meaning 'one or more') where you are to put a RED  counter, and '0' (meaning 'none') where you are to put a GREY one.    As the Subject of our Proposition is to be \"new Cakes\", we are only  concerned, at present, with the UPPER half of the cupboard, where  all the Cakes have the attribute x, that is, \"new.\"    Now, fixing our attention on this upper half, suppose we found it  marked like this,                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |     |                       |     |     |                        -----------      that is, with a red counter in No. 5.  What would this tell us,  with regard to the class of \"new Cakes\"?    Would it not tell us that there are SOME of them in the x y-compartment?  That is, that some of them (besides having the Attribute x, which  belongs to both compartments) have the Attribute y (that is, \"nice\").  This we might express by saying \"some x-Cakes are y-(Cakes)\", or,  putting words instead of letters,      \"Some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)\",      or, in a shorter form,      \"Some new Cakes are nice\".      At last we have found out how to represent the first Proposition  of this Section.  If you have not CLEARLY understood all I have  said, go no further, but read it over and over again, till you DO  understand it.  After that is once mastered, you will find all the  rest quite easy.    It will save a little trouble, in doing the other Propositions,  if we agree to leave out the word \"Cakes\" altogether.  I find it  convenient to call the whole class of Things, for which the cupboard  is intended, the 'UNIVERSE.'  Thus we might have begun this business  by saying \"Let us take a Universe of Cakes.\"  (Sounds nice, doesn't  it?)    Of course any other Things would have done just as well as Cakes.  We might make Propositions about \"a Universe of Lizards\", or even  \"a Universe of Hornets\".  (Wouldn't THAT be a charming Universe to  live in?)    So far, then, we have learned that                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |     |                       |     |     |                        -----------      means \"some x and y,\" i.e. \"some new are nice.\"    I think you will see without further explanation, that                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |     |  1  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      means \"some x are y',\" i.e. \"some new are not-nice.\"    Now let us put a GREY counter into No. 5, and ask ourselves the  meaning of                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  0  |     |                       |     |     |                        -----------      This tells us that the x y-compartment is EMPTY, which we may express  by \"no x are y\", or, \"no new Cakes are nice\".  This is the second  of the three Propositions at the head of this Section.    In the same way,                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |     |  0  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      would mean \"no x are y',\" or, \"no new Cakes are not-nice.\"    What would you make of this, I wonder?                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |  1  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      I hope you will not have much trouble in making out that this  represents a DOUBLE Proposition: namely, \"some x are y, AND some  are y',\" i.e. \"some new are nice, and some are not-nice.\"    The following is a little harder, perhaps:                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  0  |  0  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      This means \"no x are y, AND none are y',\" i.e. \"no new are nice,  AND none are not-nice\": which leads to the rather curious result  that \"no new exist,\" i.e. \"no Cakes are new.\"  This is because  \"nice\" and \"not-nice\" make what we call an 'EXHAUSTIVE' division  of the class \"new Cakes\": i.e. between them, they EXHAUST the whole  class, so that all the new Cakes, that exist, must be found in one  or the other of them.    And now suppose you had to represent, with counters the contradictory  to \"no Cakes are new\", which would be \"some Cakes are new\", or,  putting letters for words, \"some Cakes are x\", how would you do  it?    This will puzzle you a little, I expect.  Evidently you must put  a red counter SOMEWHERE in the x-half of the cupboard, since you  know there are SOME new Cakes.  But you must not put it into the  LEFT-HAND compartment, since you do not know them to be NICE: nor  may you put it into the RIGHT-HAND one, since you do not know them  to be NOT-NICE.    What, then, are you to do?  I think the best way out of the  difficulty is to place the red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between  the xy-compartment and the xy'-compartment.  This I shall represent  (as I always put '1' where you are to put a red counter) by the  diagram                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |    -1-    |                       |     |     |                        -----------      Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to express  the position of a man who wants to join one or the other of two  parties--such as their two parties 'Democrats' and 'Republicans'--but  can't make up his mind WHICH.  Such a man is said to be \"sitting  on the fence.\"  Now that is exactly the position of the red counter  you have just placed on the division-line.  He likes the look of  No. 5, and he likes the look of No. 6, and he doesn't know WHICH to  jump down into.  So there he sits astride, silly fellow, dangling  his legs, one on each side of the fence!    Now I am going to give you a much harder one to make out.  What  does this mean?                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |  0  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      This is clearly a DOUBLE Proposition.  It tells us not only that  \"some x are y,\" but also the \"no x are NOT y.\"  Hence the result  is \"ALL x are y,\" i.e.  \"all new Cakes are nice\", which is the last  of the three Propositions at the head of this Section.    We see, then, that the Universal Proposition      \"All new Cakes are nice\"      consists of TWO Propositions taken together, namely,                   \"Some new Cakes are nice,\"          and \"No new Cakes are not-nice.\"      In the same way                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  0  |  1  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      would mean \"all x are y' \", that is,      \"All new Cakes are not-nice.\"      Now what would you make of such a Proposition as \"The Cake you have  given me is nice\"?  Is it Particular or Universal?      \"Particular, of course,\" you readily reply.  \"One single Cake is  hardly worth calling 'some,' even.\"      No, my dear impulsive Reader, it is 'Universal'.  Remember that,  few as they are (and I grant you they couldn't well be fewer),  they are (or rather 'it is') ALL that you have given me!  Thus, if  (leaving 'red' out of the question) I divide my Universe of Cakes  into two classes--the Cakes you have given me (to which I assign  the upper half of the cupboard), and those you HAVEN'T given me  (which are to go below)--I find the lower half fairly full, and the  upper one as nearly as possible empty.  And then, when I am told  to put an upright division into each half, keeping the NICE Cakes  to the left, and the NOT-NICE ones to the right, I begin by carefully  collecting ALL the Cakes you have given me (saying to myself, from  time to time, \"Generous creature!  How shall I ever repay such  kindness?\"), and piling them up in the left-hand compartment.  AND  IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO DO IT!    Here is another Universal Proposition for you.  \"Barzillai Beckalegg  is an honest man.\"  That means \"ALL the Barzillai Beckaleggs, that  I am now considering, are honest men.\"  (You think I invented that  name, now don't you?  But I didn't.  It's on a carrier's cart,  somewhere down in Cornwall.)    This kind of Universal Proposition (where the Subject is a single  Thing) is called an 'INDIVIDUAL' Proposition.    Now let us take \"NICE Cakes\" as the Subject of Proposition: that  is, let us fix our thoughts on the LEFT-HAND half of the cupboard,  where all the Cakes have attribute y, that is, \"nice.\"                                                  -----    Suppose we find it marked like this:--   |     |                                             |  1  |    What would that tell us?                 |     |                                              -----                                             |     |                                             |     |                                             |     |                                              -----      I hope that it is not necessary, after explaining the HORIZONTAL  oblong so fully, to spend much time over the UPRIGHT one.  I hope  you will see, for yourself, that this means \"some y are x\", that  is,      \"Some nice Cakes are new.\"      \"But,\" you will say, \"we have had this case before.  You put a red  counter into No. 5, and you told us it meant 'some new Cakes are  nice'; and NOW you tell us that it means 'some NICE Cakes are NEW'!  Can it mean BOTH?\"    The question is a very thoughtful one, and does you GREAT credit,  dear Reader!  It DOES mean both.

INTRODUCTION.    _THE POSITIVE SCHOOL OF CRIMINAL LAW_.    DURING the past twelve or fourteen years Italy has poured forth a  stream of new ideas on the subject of crime and criminals; and  only the short-sightedness of her enemies or the vanity of her  flatterers can fail to recognise in this stream something more  than the outcome of individual labours.    A new departure in science is a simple phenomenon of nature,  determined in its origin and progress, like all such phenomena, by  conditions of time and place.  Attention must be drawn to these  conditions at the outset, for it is only by accurately defining  them that the scientific conscience of the student of sociology is  developed and confirmed.    The experimental philosophy of the latter half of our century,  combined with human biology and psychology, and with the natural  study of human society, had already produced an intellectual  atmosphere decidedly favourable to a practical inquiry into the  criminal manifestations of individual and social life.<p xv>  <p xvi>    To these general conditions must be added the plain and everyday  contrast between the metaphysical perfection of criminal law and  the progressive increase of crime, as well as the contrast between  legal theories of crime and the study of the mental  characteristics of a large number of criminals.    From this point onwards, nothing could be more natural than the  rise of a new school, whose object was to make an experimental  study of social pathology in respect of its criminal symptoms, in  order to bring theories of crime and punishment into harmony with  everyday facts.  This is the positive school of criminal law,  whereof the fundamental purpose is to study the natural genesis of  criminality in the criminal, and in the physical and social  conditions of his life, so as to apply the most effectual remedies  to the various causes of crime.    Thus we are not concerned merely with the construction of a theory  of anthropology or psychology, or a system of criminal statistics,  nor merely with the setting of abstract legal theories against  other theories which are still more abstract.  Our task is to show  that the basis of every theory concerning the self-defence of the  community against evil-doers must be the observation of the  individual and of society in their criminal activity.  In one  word, our task is to construct a criminal sociology.    For, as it seems to me, all that general sociology can do is to  furnish the more ordinary and universal inferences concerning the  life of communities; and upon this canvas the several sciences of  sociology are delineated by the specialised observation of each  <p xvii>distinct order of social facts.  In this manner we may  construct a political sociology, an economic sociology, a legal  sociology, by studying the special laws of normal or social  activity amongst human beings, after previously studying the more  general laws of individual and collective existence.  And thus we  may construct a criminal sociology, by studying, with such an aim  and by such a method, the abnormal and anti-social actions of  human beings--or, in other words, by studying crime and criminals.    Neither the Romans, great exponents as they were of the civil law,  nor the practical spirits of the Middle Ages, had been able to lay  down a philosophic system of criminal law.  It was Beccaria,  influenced far more by sentiment than by scientific precision, who  gave a great impetus to the doctrine of crimes and punishments by  summarising the ideas and sentiments of his age.[1]  Out of the  various germs contained in his generous initiative there has been  developed, to his well-deserved credit, the classical school of  criminal law.      [1] Desjardins, in the Introduction to his ``Cahiers des <E'>tats  G<e'>n<e'>raux en 1789 et la L<e'>gislation Criminelle,'' Paris,  1883, gives a good description of the state of public opinion in  that age.  He speaks also of the charges which were brought  against the advocates of the new doctrines concerning crime, that  they upset the moral and social order of things.  Nowadays,  charges against the experimental school are cited from these same  advocates; for the revolutionary of yesterday is very often the  conservative of to-day.      This school had, and still has, a practical purpose, namely, to  diminish all punishments, and to abolish a certain number, by a  magnanimous reaction of humanity against the arbitrary harshness  of medi<ae>val times.  It had also, and still has, a method of its  own, <p xviii>namely, to study crime from its first principles, as  an abstract entity "]]]
