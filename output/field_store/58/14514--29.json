At an  area 12 miles north of Kalabakan, we supplemented the guns with mist  nets in the primary forest. This method was excellent for taking rarely  seen species. For example the thrush _Zoothera interpres_ was never seen  in the field but was taken several times in mist nets.    Another method of collecting was the use of native snares. Such snares  were made of heavy nylon string tied to a sapling, held down by a nylon  string attached to a treadle. When a bird stepped on the treadle, it  tripped the snare and a loop closed about its feet, hoisting it aloft.  To divert large ground birds and mammals into the snare, natives placed  brush barriers along the top of a ridge for one or two miles. Animals  were diverted by these barriers until they came to an opening; if they  went through they usually tripped the trap. Pheasants and the large  ground cuckoo were taken in this manner.          NOTES ON ZOOGEOGRAPHY      The avifauna of Borneo is of Indo-Malayan affinities. The number of  birds endemic to Borneo is relatively small; most species are shared  with the Asian mainland. Only 29 birds are known to be endemic to the  island and 17 of these are montane. The large proportion of montane  endemics is not surprising, because Borneo has been connected with the  Asian continent in recent geological time; lowland isolation, and  differentiation, has been less extensive than the montane. The Sunda  Shelf, on which Borneo is situated, lies in a shallow sea generally less  than 300 feet deep. Beaufort has shown that the Malay Peninsula,  Sumatra, and Java were connected until early historic times (Darlington,  1957:488).    The endemic species in Borneo are members of four, possibly five, genera  that are also endemic. Four of these five genera are montane in  distribution. The only endemic for which the geographic history cannot  be adequately explained is the monotypic _Pityriasis gymnocephala_. Its  affinities seem to be with the Cracticidae of New Guinea and Australia.  The species has been found throughout Borneo. Since _Pityriasis_ is  endemic to Borneo, it probably was detached from the parent stock at an  early period. The Australasian affinities of _Pityriasis_ emphasize its  zoogeographical peculiarities. A more detailed discussion of this  species appears in the annotated list below.          COLLECTING LOCALITIES AND COLLECTORS      [Illustration: Fig. 1.

ECOLOGY OF THE COLLECTING LOCALITIES      QUOIN HILL.--At this locality I recognized five habitat types as  follows:    _Primary forest._--We were fortunate to be able to work at Quoin Hill  because it had been opened to cultivation (of Cocoa, _Theobroma cacao_)  for only a few years. Thus the primary forest here started at the edge  of the Cocoa Research Station. This was in marked contrast to areas on  the west coast, where one would need to travel many miles inland to find  virgin forest. The forest at Quoin Hill was typical tropical  rain-forest, composed mostly of dipterocarps (Dipterocarpaceae). These  comprise an essentially Indo-Malayan family, members of which are so  conspicuous that we commonly referred to it as Evergreen Dipterocarp  Forest. The lowland forests of Borneo are composed of approximately  3,000 species of trees (Browne, 1955). At Quoin Hill, as in most of the  tropical rain-forest of Borneo, the forest canopy is stratified in three  layers, a distinct and easily recognizable top story and less easily  separable middle and lower stories. The top canopy is composed of  foliage of giant trees that may tower to heights of 200 feet and have  trunks three to seven feet in diameter. The trunk is usually unbranched  for 50 to 100 feet and the whole tree is supported by buttresses jutting  out from the main trunk. Some of the most important plants in the  tropical rain-forest are the strangler figs (_Ficus_ sp.). These plants,  when in fruit, draw birds in large flocks to feed upon them. Such figs  were common about the edges of the research station and some birds taken  from these trees were never taken elsewhere. The birds seemed to wait  for a certain degree of ripeness of fruits; on one day the figs were  unmolested and the next day the trees would be swarming with birds.  Strangler fig trees reach tremendous size and help form the upper forest  canopy.    The middle and lower forest canopies are not easily separable and I  shall speak of them together. The trees forming these varied from 10 to  60 feet in height. The ground surface beneath the trees was usually bare  except for leaf litter and dead branches. Sunlight penetrates only where  the big trees have been removed or where the larger trees are otherwise  widely spaced. At Quoin Hill the large trees of species affording lumber  of commercial quality had been taken out, modifying somewhat the  character of the forest. Such forest actually contained many of the  animals characteristic of primary forest, and I refer to it as badly  disturbed primary forest.    _Secondary forest._--In some of the areas adjoining the research  station, roads had been bulldozed for future expansion and trees had  been cut. These areas were starting to grow dense stands of grass and  shrubs and will be jungle in a few years unless cut back. Most of the  trees in this area are saplings with some trees as large as a foot in  diameter.    _Fluviatile waters._--There are numerous small streams in the Quoin Hill  area, the largest being the Balung River and Apas River. Little work was  done along these streams and only the thrushes of the genus _Enicurus_  and some kingfishers seemed to be confined to them.    _Cocoa plantations._--Artificial plantings of cocoa, _Theobroma cacao_,  formed a major habitat type at Quoin Hill, and provided a major source  of food for birds. Cocoa planters have found it necessary to provide  shade with trees of some other species. In some instances trees from the  original primary forest were left standing to provide this shade, but  more often exotic trees were planted. Most of the shade trees were of no  use to birds save for providing resting places. _Trema orientalis_ was  the most important in providing food for birds. Its fruit was used more  by the frugivorous species of birds than that of any other tree in the  cocoa plantings. Tree Cassava, an exotic, was constantly attended by the  nectariniids, or honey creepers.    Although the cocoa plantings did not provide much plant material for  bird food, they did apparently nourish a horde of insects, which the  birds fed upon. A Drongo-cuckoo, _Surniculus lugubris_, had 50  caterpillars in its stomach. Healthy cocoa trees were sparsely inhabited  by birds but areas that were obviously infested with insects literally  swarmed with birds. Dead shade trees in the cocoa plantings also  provided food for woodpeckers, with four species being found utilizing  these dead trees.    _Abaca._--The last of the habitat types that I recognized at Quoin Hill  was a small grove of Abaca, _Musa textilis_, and wild bananas, _Musa_  sp. This habitat type was frequented by spiderhunters (_Arachnothera_  sp.) of the family Nectariniidae.    KALABAKAN.--We worked at three localities in this area: 12 miles north  of Kalabakan, Brantian Estate, and Kalabakan.    _Primary forest._--We were fortunate in being able to work on the very  edge of the primary forest 12 miles north of Kalabakan. The composition  of the primary forest was much like that at Quoin Hill and will not be  discussed further. About a month after we arrived at our forest camp,  logging crews moved in and cut the commercial timber near our area. The  only immediately noticeable difference in the makeup of the avifauna  after destruction of the forest canopy was the appearance of the drongo  _Dicrurus aeneus_. This drongo was seen in areas where the trees had  been cut, sitting on limbs and darting out after insects.    _Secondary forest._--The area around Kalabakan proper was in secondary  forest, which was almost impossible to penetrate.
