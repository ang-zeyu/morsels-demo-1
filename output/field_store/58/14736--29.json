Not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without  extension; but only that the mind can frame to itself by ABSTRACTION the  idea of colour exclusive of extension, and of motion exclusive of both  colour and extension.    8. OF GENERALIZING [Note].--Again, the mind having observed that in the  particular extensions perceived by sense there is something COMMON and  alike IN ALL, and some other things peculiar, as this or that figure or  magnitude, which distinguish them one from another; it considers apart or  singles out by itself that which is common, making thereof a most abstract  idea of extension, which is neither line, surface, nor solid, nor has any  figure or magnitude, but is an idea entirely prescinded from all these. So  likewise the mind, by leaving out of the particular colours perceived by  sense that which distinguishes them one from another, and retaining that  only which is COMMON TO ALL, makes an idea of colour in abstract which is  neither red, nor blue, nor white, nor any other determinate colour. And,  in like manner, by considering motion abstractedly not only from the body  moved, but likewise from the figure it describes, and all particular  directions and velocities, the abstract idea of motion is framed; which  equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may be  perceived by sense.    [Note: Vide Reid, on the Intellectual Powers of Man, Essay V,  chap iii. sec. 1, edit. 1843]    9. OF COMPOUNDING.--And as the mind frames to itself abstract ideas of  qualities or MODES, so does it, by the same precision or mental  separation, attain abstract ideas of the more compounded BEINGS  which include several coexistent qualities. For example, the mind  having observed that Peter, James, and John resemble each other  in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities, leaves  out of the complex or compounded idea it has of Peter, James, and  any other particular man, that which is peculiar to each, retaining  only what is common to all, and so makes an abstract idea wherein  all the particulars equally partake--abstracting entirely from  and cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might  determine it to any particular existence. And after this manner it is  said we come by the abstract idea of MAN, or, if you please, humanity, or  human nature; wherein it is true there is included colour, because there  is no man but has some colour, but then it can be neither white, nor  black, nor any particular colour, because there is no one particular  colour wherein all men partake. So likewise there is included stature,  but then it is neither tall stature, nor low stature, nor yet middle  stature, but something abstracted from all these. And so of the rest.  Moreover, their being a great variety of other creatures that partake in  some parts, but not all, of the complex idea of MAN, the mind, leaving  out those parts which are peculiar to men, and retaining those only which  are common to all the living creatures, frames the idea of ANIMAL, which  abstracts not only from all particular men, but also all birds, beasts,  fishes, and insects. The constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal  are body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By BODY is meant body  without any particular shape or figure, there being no one shape or  figure common to all animals, without covering, either of hair, or  feathers, or scales, &c., nor yet naked: hair, feathers, scales, and  nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals, and  for that reason left out of the ABSTRACT IDEA. Upon the same account the  spontaneous motion must be neither walking, nor flying, nor creeping; it  is nevertheless a motion, but what that motion is it is not easy to  conceive[Note.].    [Note: Vide Hobbes' Tripos, ch. v. sect. 6.]    10. TWO OBJECTIONS TO THE EXISTENCE OF ABSTRACT IDEAS.--Whether  others have this wonderful faculty of ABSTRACTING THEIR IDEAS,  they best can tell: for myself, I find indeed I have a faculty of  imagining, or representing to myself, the ideas of those particular  things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them.  I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined to  the body of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by  itself abstracted or separated from the rest of the body. But then  whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape and  colour. Likewise the idea of man that I frame to myself must be either of  a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a  low, or a middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive  the abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me to  form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and which  is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the like may  be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever. To be plain, I  own myself able to abstract IN ONE SENSE, as when I consider some  particular parts or qualities separated from others, with which, though  they are united in some object, yet it is possible they may really exist  without them. But I deny that I can abstract from one another, or  conceive separately, those qualities which it is impossible should exist  so separated; or that I can frame a general notion, by abstracting from  particulars in the manner aforesaid--which last are the two proper  acceptations of ABSTRACTION. And there are grounds to think most men will  acknowledge themselves to be in my case. The generality of men which are  simple and illiterate never pretend to ABSTRACT NOTIONS. It is said  they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and study; we may  therefore reasonably conclude that, if such there be, they are confined  only to the learned.    11. I proceed to examine what can be alleged in DEFENCE OF THE DOCTRINE  OF ABSTRACTION, and try if I can discover what it is that inclines the  men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as  that seems to be. There has been a late deservedly esteemed philosopher  who, no doubt, has given it very much countenance, by seeming to think  the having abstract general ideas is what puts the widest difference in  point of understanding betwixt man and beast. \"The having of general  ideas,\" saith he, \"is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man  and brutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no  means attain unto. For, it is evident we observe no foot-steps in them of  making use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have  reason to imagine that they have not the FACULTY OF ABSTRACTING, or  making general ideas, since they have no use of words or any other  general signs.\" And a little after: \"Therefore, I think, we may suppose  that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from men,  and it is that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated, and  which at last widens to so wide a distance. For, if they have any ideas  at all, and are not bare machines (as some would have them), we cannot  deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me that they do,  some of them, in certain instances reason as that they have sense; but it  is only in particular ideas, just as they receive them from their senses.  They are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds, and have  not (as I think) the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of  ABSTRACTION.\" Essay on Human Understanding, II. xi. 10 and 11. I readily  agree with this learned author, that the faculties of brutes can by no  means attain to ABSTRACTION. But then if this be made the distinguishing  property of that sort of animals, I fear a great many of those that pass  for men must be reckoned into their number. The reason that is here  assigned why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract general  ideas is, that we observe in them no use of words or any other general  signs; which is built on this supposition--that the making use of words  implies the having general ideas. From which it follows that men who use  language are able to ABSTRACT or GENERALIZE their ideas. That this is the  sense and arguing of the author will further appear by his answering the  question he in another place puts: \"Since all things that exist are only  particulars, how come we by general terms?\" His answer is: \"Words become  general by being made the signs of general ideas.\"--Essay on Human  Understanding, IV. iii. 6. But [Note. 1] it seems that a word becomes  general by being made the sign, not of an ABSTRACT general idea, but of  several particular ideas [Note. 2], any one of which it indifferently  suggests to the mind. For example, when it is said \"the change of motion  is proportional to the impressed force,\" or that \"whatever has extension  is divisible,\" these propositions are to be understood of motion  and extension in general; and nevertheless it will not follow that  they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body moved,  or any determinate direction and velocity, or that I must conceive  an abstract general idea of extension, which is neither line, surface,  nor solid, neither great nor small, black, white, nor red, nor of any  other determinate colour. It is only implied that whatever particular  motion I consider, whether it be swift or slow, perpendicular,  horizontal, or oblique, or in whatever object, the axiom concerning  it holds equally true. As does the other of every particular extension,  it matters not whether line, surface, or solid, whether of this or  that magnitude or figure.    [Note 1: \"TO THIS I CANNOT ASSENT, BEING OF OPINION,\" edit of 1710.]    [Note 2: Of the same sort.]    12. EXISTENCE OF GENERAL IDEAS ADMITTED.--By observing how ideas  become general we may the better judge how words are made so.  And here it is to be noted that I do not deny"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#2)"],[1,"from their being perceived?    HYL.  I mean a real absolute being, distinct from, and without any  relation to, their being perceived.    PHIL.  Heat therefore, if it be allowed a real being, must exist without  the mind?    HYL.  It must.    PHIL.  Tell me, Hylas, is this real existence equally compatible to all  degrees of heat, which we perceive; or is there any reason why we should  attribute it to some, and deny it to others? And if there be, pray let me  know that reason.    HYL.  Whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense, we may be sure the  same exists in the object that occasions it.    PHIL.  What! the greatest as well as the least?    HYL.  _I_ tell you, the reason is plainly the same in respect of both.  They are both perceived by sense; nay, the greater degree of heat is more  sensibly perceived; and consequently, if there is any difference,  we are more certain of its real existence than we can be of the reality  of a lesser degree.    PHIL.  But is not the most vehement and intense degree of heat a very  great pain?    HYL.  No one can deny it.    PHIL.  And is any unperceiving thing capable of pain or pleasure?    HYL.  No, certainly.    PHIL.  Is your material substance a senseless being, or a being endowed  with sense and perception?    HYL.  It is senseless without doubt.    PHIL.  It cannot therefore be the subject of pain?    HYL.  By no means.    PHIL.  Nor consequently of the greatest heat perceived by sense, since  you acknowledge this to be no small pain?    HYL.  I grant it.    PHIL.  What shall we say then of your external object; is it a material  Substance, or no?    HYL.  It is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering in  it.    PHIL.  How then can a great heat exist in it, since you own it cannot in  a material substance? I desire you would clear this point.    HYL.  Hold, Philonous, I fear I was out in yielding intense heat to be a  pain. It should seem rather, that pain is something distinct from heat,  and the consequence or effect of it.    PHIL.  Upon putting your hand near the fire, do you perceive one simple  uniform sensation, or two distinct sensations?    HYL.  But one simple sensation.    PHIL.  Is not the heat immediately perceived?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  And the pain?    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  Seeing therefore they are both immediately perceived at the same  time, and the fire affects you only with one simple or uncompounded idea,  it follows that this same simple idea is both the intense heat  immediately perceived, and the pain; and, consequently, that the intense  heat immediately perceived is nothing distinct from a particular sort of  pain.    HYL.  It seems so.    PHIL.  Again, try in your thoughts, Hylas, if you can conceive a  vehement sensation to be without pain or pleasure.    HYL.  I cannot.    PHIL.  Or can you frame to yourself an idea of sensible pain or pleasure  in general, abstracted from every particular idea of heat, cold, tastes,  smells? &c.    HYL.  I do not find that I can.    PHIL.  Doth it not therefore follow, that sensible pain is nothing  distinct from those sensations or ideas, in an intense degree?    HYL.  It is undeniable; and, to speak the truth, I begin to suspect a  very great heat cannot exist but in a mind perceiving it.    PHIL.  What! are you then in that sceptical state of suspense, between  affirming and denying?    HYL.  I think I may be positive in the point. A very violent and painful  heat cannot exist without the mind.    PHIL.  It hath not therefore according to you, any REAL being?    HYL.  I own it.    PHIL.  Is it therefore certain, that there is no body in nature really  hot?    HYL.  I have not denied there is any real heat in bodies. I only say,  there is no such thing as an intense real heat.    PHIL.  But, did you not say before that all degrees of heat were equally  real; or, if there was any difference, that the greater were more  undoubtedly real than the lesser?    HYL.  True: but it was because I did not then consider the ground there  is for distinguishing between them, which I now plainly see. And it is  this: because intense heat is nothing else but a particular kind of  painful sensation; and pain cannot exist but in a perceiving being; it  follows that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving  corporeal substance. But this is no reason why we should deny heat in an  inferior degree to exist in such a substance.    PHIL.  But how shall we be able to discern those degrees of heat which  exist only in the mind from those which exist without it?    HYL.  That is no difficult matter. You know the least pain cannot exist  unperceived; whatever, therefore, degree of heat is a pain exists only in  the mind. But, as for all other degrees of heat, nothing obliges us to  think the same of them.    PHIL.  I think you granted before that no unperceiving being was capable  of pleasure, any more than of pain.    HYL.  I did.    PHIL.  And is not warmth, or a more gentle degree of heat than what  causes uneasiness, a pleasure?    HYL.  What then?    PHIL.  Consequently, it cannot exist without the mind in an unperceiving  substance, or body.    HYL.  So it seems.    PHIL.  Since, therefore, as well those degrees of heat that are not  painful, as those that are, can exist only in a thinking substance; may  we not conclude that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any  degree of heat whatsoever?    HYL.  On second thoughts, I do not think it so evident that warmth is a  pleasure as that a great degree of heat is a pain.    PHIL.  _I_ do not pretend that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat is  a pain. But, if you grant it to be even a small pleasure, it serves to  make good my conclusion.    HYL.  I could rather call it an INDOLENCE. It seems to be nothing more  than a privation of both pain and pleasure. And that such a quality or  state as this may agree to an unthinking substance, I hope you will not  deny.    PHIL.  If you are resolved to maintain that warmth, or a gentle degree  of heat, is no pleasure, I know not how to convince you otherwise than by  appealing to your own sense. But what think you of cold?    HYL.  The same that I do of heat. An intense degree of cold is a pain;  for to feel a very great cold, is to perceive a great uneasiness: it  cannot therefore exist without the mind; but a lesser degree of cold may,  as well as a lesser degree of heat.    PHIL.  Those bodies, therefore, upon whose application to our own, we  perceive a moderate degree of heat, must be concluded to have a moderate  degree of heat or warmth in them; and those, upon whose application we  feel a like degree of cold, must be thought to have cold in them.    HYL.  They must.    PHIL.  Can any doctrine be true that necessarily leads a man into an  absurdity?    HYL.  Without doubt it cannot.    PHIL.  Is it not an absurdity to think that the same thing should be at  the same time both cold and warm?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Suppose now one of your hands hot, and the other cold, and that  they are both at once put into the same vessel of water, in an  intermediate state; will not the water seem cold to one hand, and warm to  the other?    HYL.  It will.    PHIL.  Ought we not therefore, by your principles, to conclude it is  really both cold and warm at the same time, that is, according to your  own concession, to believe an absurdity?    HYL.  I confess it seems so.    PHIL.  Consequently, the principles themselves are false, since you have  granted that no true principle leads to an absurdity.    HYL.  But, after all, can anything be more absurd than to say, THERE IS  NO HEAT IN THE FIRE?    PHIL.  To make the point still clearer; tell me whether, in two cases  exactly alike, we ought not to make the same judgment?    HYL.  We ought.    PHIL.  When a pin pricks your finger, doth it not rend and divide the  fibres of your flesh?    HYL.  It doth.    PHIL.  And when a coal burns your finger, doth it any more?    HYL.  It doth not.    PHIL.  Since, therefore, you neither judge the sensation itself  occasioned by the pin, nor anything like it to be in the pin; you should  not, conformably to what you have now granted, judge the sensation  occasioned by the fire, or anything like it, to be in the fire.    HYL.  Well, since it must be so, I am content to yield this point, and  acknowledge that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds.  But there still remain qualities enough to secure the reality of external  things.    PHIL.  But what will you say, Hylas, if it shall appear that the case is  the same with regard to all other sensible qualities, and that they can  no more be supposed to exist without the mind, than heat and cold?    HYL.  Then indeed you will have done something to the purpose; but that  is what I despair of seeing proved.    PHIL.  Let us examine them in order. What think you of TASTES, do they  exist without the mind, or no?    HYL.  Can any man in his senses doubt whether sugar is sweet, or  wormwood bitter?    PHIL.  Inform me, Hylas. Is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure  or pleasant sensation, or is it not?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  And is not bitterness some kind of uneasiness or pain?    HYL.  I grant it.    PHIL.  If therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal  substances existing without the mind, how can sweetness and bitterness,  that is, Pleasure and pain, agree to them?    HYL.  Hold, Philonous, I now see what it was delude time. You asked  whether heat and cold, sweetness at were not particular sorts of pleasure  and pain; to which simply, that they were. Whereas I should have thus  distinguished: those qualities, as perceived by us, are pleasures or pair  existing in the external objects. We must not therefore conclude  absolutely, that there is no heat in the fire, or sweetness in the sugar,  but only that heat or sweetness, as perceived by us, are not in the fire  or sugar. What say you to this?    PHIL.  I say it is"]]]
