Such, let us say at  once, will be the leading idea of all our investigations. Laughter must  answer to certain requirements of life in common. It must have a SOCIAL  signification.    Let us clearly mark the point towards which our three preliminary  observations are converging. The comic will come into being, it  appears, whenever a group of men concentrate their attention on one of  their number, imposing silence on their emotions and calling into play  nothing but their intelligence. What, now, is the particular point on  which their attention will have to be concentrated, and what will here  be the function of intelligence? To reply to these questions will be at  once to come to closer grips with the problem. But here a few examples  have become indispensable.      II    A man, running along the street, stumbles and falls; the passers-by  burst out laughing. They would not laugh at him, I imagine, could they  suppose that the whim had suddenly seized him to sit down on the  ground. They laugh because his sitting down is involuntary.    Consequently, it is not his sudden change of attitude that raises a  laugh, but rather the involuntary element in this change,--his  clumsiness, in fact. Perhaps there was a stone on the road. He should  have altered his pace or avoided the obstacle. Instead of that, through  lack of elasticity, through absentmindedness and a kind of physical  obstinacy, AS A RESULT, IN FACT, OF RIGIDITY OR OF MOMENTUM, the  muscles continued to perform the same movement when the circumstances  of the case called for something else. That is the reason of the man's  fall, and also of the people's laughter.    Now, take the case of a person who attends to the petty occupations of  his everyday life with mathematical precision. The objects around him,  however, have all been tampered with by a mischievous wag, the result  being that when he dips his pen into the inkstand he draws it out all  covered with mud, when he fancies he is sitting down on a solid chair  he finds himself sprawling on the floor, in a word his actions are all  topsy-turvy or mere beating the air, while in every case the effect is  invariably one of momentum. Habit has given the impulse: what was  wanted was to check the movement or deflect it. He did nothing of the  sort, but continued like a machine in the same straight line. The  victim, then, of a practical joke is in a position similar to that of a  runner who falls,--he is comic for the same reason. The laughable  element in both cases consists of a certain MECHANICAL INELASTICITY,  just where one would expect to find the wide-awake adaptability and the  living pliableness of a human being. The only difference in the two  cases is that the former happened of itself, whilst the latter was  obtained artificially. In the first instance, the passer-by does  nothing but look on, but in the second the mischievous wag intervenes.    All the same, in both cases the result has been brought about by an  external circumstance. The comic is therefore accidental: it remains,  so to speak, in superficial contact with the person. How is it to  penetrate within? The necessary conditions will be fulfilled when  mechanical rigidity no longer requires for its manifestation a  stumbling-block which either the hazard of circumstance or human  knavery has set in its way, but extracts by natural processes, from its  own store, an inexhaustible series of opportunities for externally  revealing its presence. Suppose, then, we imagine a mind always  thinking of what it has just done and never of what it is doing, like a  song which lags behind its accompaniment. Let us try to picture to  ourselves a certain inborn lack of elasticity of both senses and  intelligence, which brings it to pass that we continue to see what is  no longer visible, to hear what is no longer audible, to say what is no  longer to the point: in short, to adapt ourselves to a past and  therefore imaginary situation, when we ought to be shaping our conduct  in accordance with the reality which is present. This time the comic  will take up its abode in the person himself; it is the person who will  supply it with everything--matter and form, cause and opportunity. Is  it then surprising that the absent-minded individual--for this is the  character we have just been describing--has usually fired the  imagination of comic authors? When La Bruyere came across this  particular type, he realised, on analysing it, that he had got hold of  a recipe for the wholesale manufacture of comic effects. As a matter of  fact he overdid it, and gave us far too lengthy and detailed a  description of Menalque, coming back to his subject, dwelling and  expatiating on it beyond all bounds. The very facility of the subject  fascinated him. Absentmindedness, indeed, is not perhaps the actual  fountain-head of the comic, but surely it is contiguous to a certain  stream of facts and fancies which flows straight from the  fountain-head. It is situated, so to say, on one of the great natural  watersheds of laughter.    Now, the effect of absentmindedness may gather strength in its turn.  There is a general law, the first example of which we have just  encountered, and which we will formulate in the following terms: when a  certain comic effect has its origin in a certain cause, the more  natural we regard the cause to be, the more comic shall we find the  effect. Even now we laugh at absentmindedness when presented to us as a  simple fact. Still more laughable will be the absentmindedness we have  seen springing up and growing before our very eyes, with whose origin  we are acquainted and whose life-history we can reconstruct. To choose  a definite example: suppose a man has taken to reading nothing but  romances of love and chivalry. Attracted and fascinated by his heroes,  his thoughts and intentions gradually turn more and more towards them,  till one fine day we find him walking among us like a somnambulist. His  actions are distractions. But then his distractions can be traced back  to a definite, positive cause. They are no longer cases of ABSENCE of  mind, pure and simple; they find their explanation in the PRESENCE of  the individual in quite definite, though imaginary, surroundings.  Doubtless a fall is always a fall, but it is one thing to tumble into a  well because you were looking anywhere but in front of you, it is quite  another thing to fall into it because you were intent upon a star. It  was certainly a star at which Don Quixote was gazing. How profound is  the comic element in the over-romantic, Utopian bent of mind! And yet,  if you reintroduce the idea of absentmindedness, which acts as a  go-between, you will see this profound comic element uniting with the  most superficial type. Yes, indeed, these whimsical wild enthusiasts,  these madmen who are yet so strangely reasonable, excite us to laughter  by playing on the same chords within ourselves, by setting in motion  the same inner mechanism, as does the victim of a practical joke or the  passer-by who slips down in the street. They, too, are runners who fall  and simple souls who are being hoaxed--runners after the ideal who  stumble over realities, child-like dreamers for whom life delights to  lie in wait. But, above all, they are past-masters in absentmindedness,  with this superiority over their fellows that their absentmindedness is  systematic and organised around one central idea, and that their  mishaps are also quite coherent, thanks to the inexorable logic which  reality applies to the correction of dreams, so that they kindle in  those around them, by a series of cumulative effects, a hilarity  capable of unlimited expansion.    Now, let us go a little further. Might not certain vices have the same  relation to character that the rigidity of a fixed idea has to  intellect? Whether as a moral kink or a crooked twist given to the  will, vice has often the appearance of a curvature of the soul.  Doubtless there are vices into which the soul plunges deeply with all  its pregnant potency, which it rejuvenates and drags along with it into  a moving circle of reincarnations. Those are tragic vices. But the vice  capable of making us comic is, on the contrary, that which is brought  from without, like a ready-made frame into which we are to step. It  lends us its own rigidity instead of borrowing from us our flexibility.  We do not render it more complicated; on the contrary, it simplifies  us. Here, as we shall see later on in the concluding section of this  study, lies the essential difference between comedy and drama. A drama,  even when portraying passions or vices that bear a name, so completely  incorporates them in the person that their names are forgotten, their  general characteristics effaced, and we no longer think of them at all,  but rather of the person in whom they are assimilated; hence, the title  of a drama can seldom be anything else than a proper noun. On the other  hand, many comedies have a common noun as their title: l'Avare, le  Joueur, etc. Were you asked to think of a play capable of being called  le Jaloux, for instance, you would find that Sganarelle or George  Dandin would occur to your mind, but not Othello: le Jaloux could only  be the title of a comedy. The reason is that, however intimately vice,  when comic, is associated with persons, it none the less retains its  simple, independent existence, it remains the central character,  present though invisible, to which the characters in flesh and blood on  the stage are attached. At times it delights in dragging them down with  its own weight and making them share in its tumbles. More frequently,  however, it plays on them as on an instrument or pulls the strings as  though they were puppets. Look closely: you will find that the art of  the comic poet consists in making us so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1,"o!\" cried Beni, with sudden fierceness; \"we must not abandon our  high calling. Bandits we have always been, and bandits we must  remain!\"    \"'Tis so!\" agreed the fat man.    \"Even in Chicago there must be people to rob,\" remarked Victor, with  cheerfulness.    Martha was distressed.    \"I think they have all been robbed,\" she objected.    \"Then we can rob the robbers, for we have experience and talent  beyond the ordinary,\" said Beni.    \"Oh, dear; oh, dear!\" moaned the girl; \"why did Uncle Walter ever  send you here in this chest?\"    The bandits became interested.    \"That is what we should like to know,\" declared Victor, eagerly.    \"But no one will ever know, for Uncle Walter was lost while hunting  elephants in Africa,\" she continued, with conviction.    \"Then we must accept our fate and rob to the best of our ability,\"  said Victor. \"So long as we are faithful to our beloved profession  we need not be ashamed.\"    \"'Tis so!\" cried the fat man.    \"Brothers! we will begin now. Let us rob the house we are in.\"    \"Good!\" shouted the others and sprang to their feet.    Beni turned threateningly upon the child.    \"Remain here!\" he commanded. \"If you stir one step your blood will  be on your own head!\" Then he added, in a gentler voice: \"Don't be  afraid; that's the way all bandits talk to their captives. But of  course we wouldn't hurt a young lady under any circumstances.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Victor.    The fat man drew a big knife from his belt and flourished it about  his head.    \"S'blood!\" he ejaculated, fiercely.    \"S'bananas!\" cried Beni, in a terrible voice.    \"Confusion to our foes!\" hissed Victor.    And then the three bent themselves nearly double and crept  stealthily down the stairway with cocked pistols in their hands and  glittering knives between their teeth, leaving Martha trembling with  fear and too horrified to even cry for help.    How long she remained alone in the attic she never knew, but finally  she heard the catlike tread of the returning bandits and saw them  coming up the stairs in single file.    All bore heavy loads of plunder in their arms, and Lugui was  balancing a mince pie on the top of a pile of her mother's best  evening dresses. Victor came next with an armful of bric-a-brac, a  brass candelabra and the parlor clock. Beni had the family Bible,  the basket of silverware from the sideboard, a copper kettle and  papa's fur overcoat.    \"Oh, joy!\" said Victor, putting down his load; \"it is pleasant to  rob once more.\"    \"Oh, ecstacy!\" said Beni; but he let the kettle drop on his toe and  immediately began dancing around in anguish, while he muttered queer  words in the Italian language.    \"We have much wealth,\" continued Victor, holding the mince pie while  Lugui added his spoils to the heap; \"and all from one house! This  America must be a rich place.\"    With a dagger he then cut himself a piece of the pie and handed the  remainder to his comrades. Whereupon all three sat upon the floor  and consumed the pie while Martha looked on sadly.    \"We should have a cave,\" remarked Beni; \"for we must store our  plunder in a safe place. Can you tell us of a secret cave?\" he asked  Martha.    \"There's a Mammoth cave,\" she answered, \"but it's in Kentucky. You  would be obliged to ride on the cars a long time to get there.\"    The three bandits looked thoughtful and munched their pie silently,  but the next moment they were startled by the ringing of the  electric doorbell, which was heard plainly even in the remote attic.    \"What's that?\" demanded Victor, in a hoarse voice, as the three  scrambled to their feet with drawn daggers.    Martha ran to the window and saw it was only the postman, who had  dropped a letter in the box and gone away again. But the incident  gave her an idea of how to get rid of her troublesome bandits, so  she began wringing her hands as if in great distress and cried out:    \"It's the police!\"    The robbers looked at one another with genuine alarm, and Lugui  asked, tremblingly:    \"Are there many of them?\"    \"A hundred and twelve!\" exclaimed Martha, after pretending to count  them.    \"Then we are lost!\" declared Beni; \"for we could never fight so many  and live.\"    \"Are they armed?\" inquired Victor, who was shivering as if cold.    \"Oh, yes,\" said she. \"They have guns and swords and pistols and axes  and--and--\"    \"And what?\" demanded Lugui.    \"And cannons!\"    The three wicked ones groaned aloud and Beni said, in a hollow  voice:    \"I hope they will kill us quickly and not put us to the torture. I  have been told these Americans are painted Indians, who are  bloodthirsty and terrible.\"    \"'Tis so!\" gasped the fat man, with a shudder.    Suddenly Martha turned from the window.    \"You are my friends, are you not?\" she asked.    \"We are devoted!\" answered Victor.    \"We adore you!\" cried Beni.    \"We would die for you!\" added Lugui, thinking he was about to die  anyway.    \"Then I will save you,\" said the girl.    \"How?\" asked the three, with one voice.    \"Get back into the chest,\" she said. \"I will then close the lid, so  they will be unable to find you.\"    They looked around the room in a dazed and irresolute way, but she  exclaimed:    \"You must be quick! They will soon be here to arrest you.\"    Then Lugui sprang into the chest and lay fat upon the bottom. Beni  tumbled in next and packed himself in the back side. Victor followed  after pausing to kiss her hand to the girl in a graceful manner.    Then Martha ran up to press down the lid, but could not make it  catch.    \"You must squeeze down,\" she said to them.    Lugui groaned.    \"I am doing my best, miss,\" said Victor, who was nearest the top;  \"but although we fitted in very nicely before, the chest now seems  rather small for us.\"    \"'Tis so!\" came the muffled voice of the fat man from the bottom.    \"I know what takes up the room,\" said Beni.    \"What?\" inquired Victor, anxiously.    \"The pie,\" returned Beni.    \"'Tis so!\" came from the bottom, in faint accents.    Then Martha sat upon the lid and pressed it down with all her  weight. To her great delight the lock caught, and, springing down,  she exerted all her strength and turned the key.    * * * * *    This story should teach us not to interfere in matters that do not  concern us. For had Martha refrained from opening Uncle Walter's  mysterious chest she would not have been obliged to carry downstairs  all the plunder the robbers had brought into the attic.          THE GLASS DOG      An accomplished wizard once lived on the top floor of a tenement  house and passed his time in thoughtful study and studious thought.  What he didn't know about wizardry was hardly worth knowing, for he  possessed all the books and recipes of all the wizards who had lived  before him; and, moreover, he had invented several wizardments  himself.    This admirable person would have been completely happy but for the  numerous interruptions to his studies caused by folk who came to  consult him about their troubles (in which he was not interested),  and by the loud knocks of the iceman, the milkman, the baker's boy,  the laundryman and the peanut woman. He never dealt with any of  these people; but they rapped at his door every day to see him about  this or that or to try to sell him their wares. Just when he was  most deeply interested in his books or engaged in watching the  bubbling of a cauldron there would come a knock at his door. And  after sending the intruder away he always found he had lost his  train of thought or ruined his compound.    At length these interruptions aroused his anger, and he decided he  must have a dog to keep people away from his door. He didn't know  where to find a dog, but in the next room lived a poor glass-blower  with whom he had a slight acquaintance; so he went into the man's  apartment and asked:    \"Where can I find a dog?\"    \"What sort of a dog?\" inquired the glass-blower.    \"A good dog. One that will bark at people and drive them away. One  that will be no trouble to keep and won't expect to be fed. One that  has no fleas and is neat in his habits. One that will obey me when I  speak to him. In short, a good dog,\" said the wizard.    \"Such a dog is hard to find,\" returned the glass-blower, who was  busy making a blue glass flower pot with a pink glass rosebush in  it, having green glass leaves and yellow glass roses.    The wizard watched him thoughtfully.    \"Why cannot you blow me a dog out of glass?\" he asked, presently.    \"I can,\" declared the glass-blower; \"but it would not bark at  people, you know.\"    \"Oh, I'll fix that easily enough,\" replied the other. \"If I could  not make a glass dog bark I would be a mighty poor wizard.\"    \"Very well; if you can use a glass dog I'll be pleased to blow one  for you. Only, you must pay for my work.\"    \"Certainly,\" agreed the wizard. \"But I have none of that horrid  stuff you call money. You must take some of my wares in exchange.\"    The glass-blower considered the matter for a moment.    \"Could you give me something to cure my rheumatism?\" he asked.    \"Oh, yes; easily.\"    \"Then it's a bargain. I'll start the dog at once. What color of  glass shall I use?\"    \"Pink is a pretty color,\" said the wizard, \"and it's unusual for a  dog, isn't it?\"    \"Very,\" answered the glass-blower; \"but it shall be pink.\"    So the wizard went back to his studies and the glass-blower began to  make the dog.    Next morning he entered the wizard's room with the glass dog under  his arm and set it carefully upon the table. It was a beautiful pink  in color, with a fine coat of spun glass, and about its neck was  twisted a blue glass ribbon. Its eyes were specks of black glass and  sparkled intelligently, as do many of the glass eyes worn by men.    The wizard expressed himself pleased with the glass-blower's skill  and at once handed him a small vial.    \"This will cure your rheumatism,\" he said.    \"But the vial is empty!\" protested the glass-blower.    \"Oh, no;"]]]
