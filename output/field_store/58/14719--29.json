Dying, he curses Marguerite, who comes from the  church to his side, and accuses her of bringing him to his end.      ACT V.--Marguerite, her reason shaken by her misfortunes, has killed  her child, and for this crime she is thrown into prison, and condemned  to die. Faust, aided by Mephistopheles, obtains access to her cell  and urges her to fly with him; but her poor mind cannot grasp the  situation, and recurs only to the scenes of their love. When she sees  Faust's companion, she turns from him in horror, falls upon her knees,  and implores the mercy of heaven. As she sinks in death, Mephistopheles  pronounces her damned, but a heavenly voice proclaims her pardoned; and  while a celestial choir chants the Easter hymn the soul of Marguerite  is seen borne up to heaven by angels. Faust falls to his knees, and the  devil crouches beneath the shining sword of an archangel.    First performed at the Theatre Lyrique, Paris, March 19, 1859,  with the following cast:      LE DOCTEUR FAUST                _MM.

He is seated at a table covered  with books and parchments; an open book lies before him. His lamp is  flickering in the socket.)    _Faust._ No! In vain hath my soul aspired, with ardent longing,           All to know,--all in earth and heaven.           No light illumines the visions, ever thronging           My brain; no peace is given,           And I linger, thus sad and weary,           Without power to sunder the chain           Binding my soul to life always dreary.           Nought do I see! Nought do I know!      (He closes the book and rises. Day begins to dawn.)             Again 'tis light!           On its westward course flying,           The somber night vanishes.                      (Despairingly.)           Again the light of a new day!           O death! when will thy dusky wings           Above me hover and give me--rest?                    (Seizing a flask on the table.)           Well, then! Since death thus evades me,           Why should I not go in search of him?           Hail, my final day, all hail!           No fears my heart assail;           On earth my days I number;           For this draught immortal slumber           Will secure me, and care dispel!        (Pours liquid from the flask into a crystal goblet. Just as he is  about to raise it to his lips, the following chorus is heard, without.)    _Cho. of Maidens._ Why thy eyes so lustrous           Hidest thou from sight?           Bright Sol now is scatt'ring           Beams of golden light;           The nightingale is warbling           Its carol of love;           Rosy tints of morning           Now gleam from above;           Flow'rs unfold their beauty           To the scented gale;           Nature all awakens--           Of love tells its tale.    _Faust._ Hence, empty sounds of human joys           Flee far from me.           O goblet, which my ancestors           So many times have filled,           Why tremblest thou in my grasp?                (Again raising the goblet to his lips.)  _Cho. of Laborers_                      (without).           The morn into the fields doth summon us,           The swallow hastes away!           Why tarry, then?           To labor let's away! to work let's on,           The sky is bright, the earth is fair,           Our tribute, then, let's pay to heav'n.    _Cho. of Maidens and Laborers._           Praises to God!    _Faust._ God! God!                (He sinks into a chair.)           But this God, what will he do for me?                        (Rising.)           Will he return to me youth, love, and faith?                      (With rage.)           Cursed be all of man's vile race!           Cursed be the chains which bind him in his place!           Cursed be visions false, deceiving!           Cursed the folly of believing!           Cursed be dreams of love or hate!           Cursed be souls with joy elate.           Cursed be science, prayer, and faith!           Cursed my fate in life and death!                Infernal king, arise!                *       *       *       *       *      SCENE II.    FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mep._                 (suddenly appearing).           Here am I! So, I surprise you?           SATAN, Sir, at your service!           A sword at my side; on my hat a gay feather;--           A cloak o'er my shoulder; and altogether,           Why, gotten up quite in the fashion!                       (Briskly.)           But come, Doctor Faust, what is your will?           Behold! Speak! Are you afraid of me?    _Faust._ No.    _Mep._   Do you doubt my power?    _Faust._ Perhaps.    _Mep._   Prove it, then.    _Faust._ Begone!    _Mep._   Fie! Fie! Is this your politeness!           But learn, my friend, that with Satan           One should conduct in a different way.           I've entered your door with infinite trouble.           Would you kick me out the very same day?    _Faust._ Then what will you do for me?    _Mep._   Anything in the world! All things. But           Say first what you would have.           Abundance of gold?    _Faust._ And what can I do with riches?    _Mep._   Good. I see where the shoe pinches.           You will have glory.    _Faust._ Still wrong.    _Mep._   Power, then.    _Faust._ No. I would have a treasure           Which contains all. I wish for youth.           Oh! I would have pleasure,           And love, and caresses,           For youth is the season           When joy most impresses.           One round of enjoyment,           One scene of delight,           Should be my employment           From day-dawn till night.           Oh, I would have pleasure,           And love, and caresses;           If youth you restore me,           My joys I'll renew!    _Mep._   'Tis well--all thou desirest I can give thee.    _Faust._ Ah! but what must I give in return?    _Mep._   'Tis but little:           In this world I will be thy slave,           But down below thou must be mine.    _Faust._ Below!    _Mep._   Below.                    (Unfolding a scroll.)           Come, write. What! does thy hand tremble?           Whence this dire trepidation?           'Tis youth that now awaits thee--Behold!    (At a sign from MEPHISTOPHELES, the scene opens  and discloses MARGUERITE, spinning.)    _Faust._ Oh, wonder!    _Mep._   Well, how do you like it?                   (Taking parchment.)  _Faust._ Give me the scroll!                       (Signs.)  _Mep._   Come on then! And now, master,                    (Taking cup from the table.)           I invite thee to empty a cup,           In which there is neither poison nor death,           But young and vigorous life.    _Faust._                 (Taking cup and turning toward Marguerite.)           O beautiful, adorable vision! I drink to thee!        (He drinks the contents of the cup, and is transformed    into a young and handsome man. The vision disappears.)    _Mep._   Come, then.    _Faust._ Say, shall I again behold her?    _Mep._   Most surely!    _Faust._ When?    _Mep._   This very day!    _Faust._ 'Tis well.    _Mep._   Then let's away.    _Both._  'Tis pleasure I covet,           'Tis beauty I crave;           I sigh for its kisses,           Its love I demand!           With ardor unwonted           I long now to burn;           I sigh for the rapture           Of heart and of sense.                   (Exeunt. The curtain falls.)          ACT II.      SCENE I.    _The Kermesse._      (One of the city gates. To the left, an Inn,      bearing the sign of the god Bacchus.)      WAGNER, Students, Burghers, Soldiers, Maidens, and Matrons.    _Studs._ Wine or beer, now, which you will!           So the glass quick you fill!           And replenish at our need:           At our bouts we drink with speed!    _Wag._   Now, young tipplers at the cask,           Don't refuse what I ask--           Drink to glory! drink to love!           Drain the sparkling glass!    _Studs._ We young tipplers at the cask           Won't refuse what you ask--           Here's to glory! here's to love!           Drain the sparkling glass!                     (They drink.)    _Soldiers._ Castles, hearts, or fortresses,                Are to us all one.              Strong towers, maids with fair tresses,                By the brave are won;              He, who hath the art to take them,                Shows no little skill;              He, who knows the way to keep them,                Hath more wisdom still.    _Citizens._ On holy-days and feast-days,           I love to talk of war and battles.           While the toiling crowds around           Worry their brains with affairs,           I stroll calmly to this retreat           On the banks of the gliding river,           And behold the boats which pass           While I leisurely empty my glass.                 (Citizens and soldiers go to back of stage.)               (A group of young girls enters.)    _Girls._ Merry fellows come this way,           Yes, they now advance;           Let us, then, our steps delay,           Just to take one glance.           (They go to right of stage.          A second chorus of students enters after them.)    _Studs._ Sprightly maidens now advance,           Watch their conquering airs;           Friends be guarded, lest a glance           Take you unawares.    _Matrons._               (watching the students and young girls).

You propose then, PHILO, said CLEANTHES, to erect religious faith on  philosophical scepticism; and you think, that if certainty or evidence be  expelled from every other subject of inquiry, it will all retire to these  theological doctrines, and there acquire a superior force and authority.  Whether your scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you pretend, we  shall learn by and by, when the company breaks up: We shall then see,  whether you go out at the door or the window; and whether you really  doubt if your body has gravity, or can be injured by its fall; according  to popular opinion, derived from our fallacious senses, and more  fallacious experience. And this consideration, DEMEA, may, I think,  fairly serve to abate our ill-will to this humorous sect of the sceptics.  If they be thoroughly in earnest, they will not long trouble the world  with their doubts, cavils, and disputes: If they be only in jest, they  are, perhaps, bad raillers; but can never be very dangerous, either to  the state, to philosophy, or to religion.    In reality, PHILO, continued he, it seems certain, that though a man, in  a flush of humour, after intense reflection on the many contradictions  and imperfections of human reason, may entirely renounce all belief and  opinion, it is impossible for him to persevere in this total scepticism,  or make it appear in his conduct for a few hours. External objects press  in upon him; passions solicit him; his philosophical melancholy  dissipates; and even the utmost violence upon his own temper will not be  able, during any time, to preserve the poor appearance of scepticism. And  for what reason impose on himself such a violence? This is a point in  which it will be impossible for him ever to satisfy himself, consistently  with his sceptical principles. So that, upon the whole, nothing could be  more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient PYRRHONIANS; if in  reality they endeavoured, as is pretended, to extend, throughout, the  same scepticism which they had learned from the declamations of their  schools, and which they ought to have confined to them.    In this view, there appears a great resemblance between the sects of the  STOICS and PYRRHONIANS, though perpetual antagonists; and both of them  seem founded on this erroneous maxim, That what a man can perform  sometimes, and in some dispositions, he can perform always, and in every  disposition. When the mind, by Stoical reflections, is elevated into a  sublime enthusiasm of virtue, and strongly smit with any species of  honour or public good, the utmost bodily pain and sufferings will not  prevail over such a high sense of duty; and it is possible, perhaps, by  its means, even to smile and exult in the midst of tortures. If this  sometimes may be the case in fact and reality, much more may a  philosopher, in his school, or even in his closet, work himself up to  such an enthusiasm, and support in imagination the acutest pain or most  calamitous event which he can possibly conceive. But how shall he support  this enthusiasm itself? The bent of his mind relaxes, and cannot be  recalled at pleasure; avocations lead him astray; misfortunes attack him  unawares; and the philosopher sinks by degrees into the plebeian.    I allow of your comparison between the STOICS and SKEPTICS, replied  PHILO. But you may observe, at the same time, that though the mind  cannot, in Stoicism, support the highest flights of philosophy, yet, even  when it sinks lower, it still retains somewhat of its former disposition;  and the effects of the Stoic's reasoning will appear in his conduct in  common life, and through the whole tenor of his actions. The ancient  schools, particularly that of ZENO, produced examples of virtue and  constancy which seem astonishing to present times.          Vain Wisdom all and false Philosophy.      Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm      Pain, for a while, or anguish; and excite      Fallacious Hope, or arm the obdurate breast      With stubborn Patience, as with triple steel.      In like manner, if a man has accustomed himself to sceptical  considerations on the uncertainty and narrow limits of reason, he will  not entirely forget them when he turns his reflection on other subjects;  but in all his philosophical principles and reasoning, I dare not say in  his common conduct, he will be found different from those, who either  never formed any opinions in the case, or have entertained sentiments  more favourable to human reason.    To whatever length any one may push his speculative principles of  scepticism, he must act, I own, and live, and converse, like other men;  and for this conduct he is not obliged to give any other reason, than the  absolute necessity he lies under of so doing. If he ever carries his  speculations further than this necessity constrains him, and  philosophises either on natural or moral subjects, he is allured by a  certain pleasure and satisfaction which he finds in employing himself  after that manner. He considers besides, that every one, even in common  life, is constrained to have more or less of this philosophy; that from  our earliest infancy we make continual advances in forming more general  principles of conduct and reasoning; that the larger experience we  acquire, and the stronger reason we are endued with, we always render our  principles the more general and comprehensive; and that what we call  philosophy is nothing but a more regular and methodical operation of the  same kind. To philosophise on such subjects, is nothing essentially  different from reasoning on common life; and we may only expect greater  stability, if not greater truth, from our philosophy, on account of its  exacter and more scrupulous method of proceeding.    But when we look beyond human affairs and the properties of the  surrounding bodies: when we carry our speculations into the two  eternities, before and after the present state of things; into the  creation and formation of the universe; the existence and properties of  spirits; the powers and operations of one universal Spirit existing  without beginning and without end; omnipotent, omniscient, immutable,  infinite, and incomprehensible: We must be far removed from the smallest  tendency to scepticism not to be apprehensive, that we have here got  quite beyond the reach of our faculties. So long as we confine our  speculations to trade, or morals, or politics, or criticism, we make  appeals, every moment, to common sense and experience, which strengthen  our philosophical conclusions, and remove, at least in part, the  suspicion which we so justly entertain with regard to every reasoning  that is very subtle and refined. But, in theological reasonings, we have  not this advantage; while, at the same time, we are employed upon  objects, which, we must be sensible, are too large for our grasp, and of  all others, require most to be familiarised to our apprehension. We are  like foreigners in a strange country, to whom every thing must seem  suspicious, and who are in danger every moment of transgressing against  the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and converse. We  know not how far we ought to trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in  such a subject; since, even in common life, and in that province which is  peculiarly appropriated to them, we cannot account for them, and are  entirely guided by a kind of instinct or necessity in employing them.    All sceptics pretend, that, if reason be considered in an abstract view,  it furnishes invincible arguments against itself; and that we could never  retain any conviction or assurance, on any subject, were not the  sceptical reasonings so refined and subtle, that they are not able to  counterpoise the more solid and more natural arguments derived from the  senses and experience. But it is evident, whenever our arguments lose  this advantage, and run wide of common life, that the most refined  scepticism comes to be upon a footing with them, and is able to oppose  and counterbalance them. The one has no more weight than the other. The  mind must remain in suspense between them; and it is that very suspense  or balance, which is the triumph of scepticism.    But I observe, says CLEANTHES, with regard to you, PHILO, and all  speculative sceptics, that your doctrine and practice are as much at  variance in the most abstruse points of theory as in the conduct of  common life. Wherever evidence discovers itself, you adhere to it,  notwithstanding your pretended scepticism; and I can observe, too, some  of your sect to be as decisive as those who make greater professions of  certainty and assurance. In reality, would not a man be ridiculous, who  pretended to reject NEWTON's explication of the wonderful phenomenon of  the rainbow, because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays  of light; a subject, forsooth, too refined for human comprehension? And  what would you say to one, who, having nothing particular to object to  the arguments of COPERNICUS and GALILEO for the motion of the earth,  should withhold his assent, on that general principle, that these  subjects were too magnificent and remote to be explained by the narrow  and fallacious reason of mankind?    There is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant scepticism, as you well  observed, which gives the vulgar a general prejudice against what they do  not easily understand, and makes them reject every principle which  requires elaborate reasoning to prove and establish it. This species of  scepticism is fatal to knowledge, not to religion; since we find, that  those who make greatest profession of it, give often their assent, not  only to the great truths of Theism and natural theology, but even to the  most absurd tenets which a traditional superstition has recommended to  them.
