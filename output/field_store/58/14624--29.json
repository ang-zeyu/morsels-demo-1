She was  a daughter of the Marktrichter (market judge), and had been a cook in  the family of Count Harrach, one of the local magnates. Eight years  younger than her husband, she was just twenty-one at her marriage, and  bore him twelve children. Haydn's regard for her was deep and sincere;  and it was one of the tricks of destiny that she was not spared to  witness more of his rising fame, being cut off in 1754, when she was  only forty-six. Matthias Haydn promptly married again, and had a second  family of five children, all of whom died in infancy. The stepmother  survived her husband--who died, as the result of an accident, in  1763--and then she too entered a second time into the wedded state.  Haydn can never have been very intimate with her, and he appears to have  lost sight of her entirely in her later years. But he bequeathed a small  sum to her in his will, \"to be transferred to her children should she be  no longer alive.\"    Birth    Joseph Haydn, to give the composer the name which he now usually bears,  was the second of the twelve children born to the Rohrau wheelwright.  The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but it was either the 31st  of March or the 1st of April 1732. Haydn himself gave the latter as  the correct date, alleging that his brother Michael had fixed upon the  previous day to save him from being called an April fool! Probably we  shall not be far off the mark if we assume with Pohl that Haydn was born  in the night between the 31st of March and the 1st of April.    His Precocity    Very few details have come down to us in regard to his earlier  years; and such details as we have refer almost wholly to his musical  precocity. It was not such a precocity as that of Mozart, who was  playing minuets at the age of four, and writing concertos when he  was five; but just on that account it is all the more credible. One's  sympathies are with the frank Philistine who pooh-poohs the tales told  of baby composers, and hints that they must have been a trial to their  friends. Precocious they no doubt were; but precocity often evaporates  before it can become genius, leaving a sediment of disappointed hopes  and vain ambitions. In literature, as Mr Andrew Lang has well observed,  genius may show itself chiefly in acquisition, as in Sir Walter Scott,  who, as a boy, was packing all sorts of lore into a singularly capacious  mind, while doing next to nothing that was noticeable. In music it is  different. Various learning is not so important as a keenly sensitive  organism. The principal thing is emotion, duly ordered by the intellect,  not intellect touched by emotion. Haydn's precocity at any rate was of  this sort. It proclaimed itself in a quick impressionableness to sound,  a delicately-strung ear, and an acute perception of rhythm.    Informal Music-Making    We have seen how the father had his musical evenings with his harp and  the voices of wife and children. These informal rehearsals were  young Haydn's delight. We hear more particularly of his attempts at  music-making by sawing away upon a piece of stick at his father's side,  pretending to play the violin like the village schoolmaster under whom  he was now learning his rudiments. The parent was hugely pleased at  these manifestations of musical talent in his son. He had none of the  absurd, old-world ideas of Surgeon Handel as to the degrading character  of the divine art, but encouraged the youngster in every possible  way. Already he dreamt--what father of a clever boy has not done the  same?--that Joseph would in some way or other make the family name  famous; and although it is said that like his wife, he had notions of  the boy becoming a priest, he took the view that his progress towards  holy orders would be helped rather than hindered by the judicious  cultivation of his undoubted taste for music.    His First Teacher    While these thoughts were passing through his head, the chance visit of  a relation practically decided young Haydn's future. His grandmother,  being left a widow, had married a journeyman wheelwright, Matthias  Seefranz, and one of their children married a schoolmaster, Johann  Matthias Frankh. Frankh combined with the post of pedagogue that of  choir-regent at Hainburg, the ancestral home of the Haydns, some  four leagues from Rohrau. He came occasionally to Rohrau to see his  relatives, and one day he surprised Haydn keeping strict time to the  family music on his improvised fiddle. Some discussion following about  the boy's unmistakable talent, the schoolmaster generously offered to  take him to Hainburg that he might learn \"the first elements of music  and other juvenile acquirements.\" The father was pleased; the mother,  hesitating at first, gave her reluctant approval, and Haydn left the  family home never to return, except on a flying visit. This was in 1738,  when he was six years of age.    Hainburg    The town of Hainburg lies close to the Danube, and looks very  picturesque with its old walls and towers. According to the Nibelungen  Lied, King Attila once spent a night in the place, and a stone figure  of that \"scourge of God\" forms a feature of the Hainburg Wiener Thor, a  rock rising abruptly from the river, crowned with the ruined Castle  of Rottenstein. The town cannot be very different from what it was in  Haydn's time, except perhaps that there is now a tobacco manufactory,  which gives employment to some 2000 hands.    It is affecting to think of the little fellow of six dragged away from  his home and his mother's watchful care to be planted down here among  strange surroundings and a strange people. That he was not very happy  we might have assumed in any case. But there were, unfortunately, some  things to render him more unhappy than he need have been. Frankh's  intentions were no doubt excellent; but neither in temper nor in  character was he a fit guardian and instructor of youth. He got into  trouble with the authorities more than once for neglect of his duties,  and had to answer a charge of gambling with loaded dice. As a teacher  he was of that stern disciplinarian kind which believes in lashing  instruction into the pupil with the \"tingling rod.\" Haydn says he owed  him more cuffs than gingerbread.    \"A Regular Little Urchin\"    What he owed to the schoolmaster's wife may be inferred from the fact  that she compelled him to wear a wig \"for the sake of cleanliness.\"  All his life through Haydn was most particular about his personal  appearance, and when quite an old man it pained him greatly to recall  the way in which he was neglected by Frau Frankh. \"I could not help  perceiving,\" he remarked to Dies, \"much to my distress, that I was  gradually getting very dirty, and though I thought a good deal of my  little person, was not always able to avoid spots of dirt on my clothes,  of which I was dreadfully ashamed. In fact, I was a regular little  urchin.\" Perhaps we should not be wrong in surmising that the old man  was here reading into his childhood the habits and sentiments of his  later years. Young boys of his class are not usually deeply concerned  about grease spots or disheveled hair.    Attacks the Drum    At all events, if deplorably neglected in these personal matters, he was  really making progress with his art. Under Frankh's tuition he attained  to some proficiency on the violin and the harpsichord, and his voice was  so improved that, as an early biographer puts it, he was able to \"sing  at the parish desk in a style which spread his reputation through the  canton.\" Haydn himself, going back upon these days in a letter of 1779,  says: \"Our Almighty Father (to whom above all I owe the most profound  gratitude) had endowed me with so much facility in music that even in my  sixth year I was bold enough to sing some masses in the choir.\" He was  bold enough to attempt something vastly more ponderous. A drummer  being wanted for a local procession, Haydn undertook to play the part.  Unluckily, he was so small of stature that the instrument had to be  carried before him on the back of a colleague! That the colleague  happened to be a hunchback only made the incident more ludicrous. But  Haydn had rather a partiality for the drum--a satisfying instrument,  as Mr George Meredith says, because of its rotundity--and, as we  shall learn when we come to his visits to London, he could handle the  instrument well enough to astonish the members of Salomon's orchestra.  According to Pohl, the particular instrument upon which he performed on  the occasion of the Hainburg procession is still preserved in the choir  of the church there.    Hard as these early years must have been, Haydn recognized in after-life  that good had mingled with the ill. His master's harshness had taught  him patience and self-reliance. \"I shall be grateful to Frankh as long  as I live,\" he said to Griesinger, \"for keeping me so hard at work.\"  He always referred to Frankh as \"my first instructor,\" and, like Handel  with Zachau, he acknowledged his indebtedness in a practical way by  bequeathing to Frankh's daughter, then married, 100 florins and a  portrait of her father--a bequest which she missed by dying four years  before the composer himself.    A Piece of Good Fortune    Haydn had been two years with Frankh when an important piece of good  fortune befell him. At the time of which we are writing the Court  Capellmeister at Vienna was George Reutter, an inexhaustible composer  of church music, whose works, now completely forgotten, once had a great  vogue in all the choirs of the Imperial States. Even in 1823 Beethoven,  who was to write a mass for the Emperor Francis, was recommended to  adopt the style of this frilled and periwigged pedant! Reutter's father  had been for many years Capellmeister at St Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna,  and on his death, in 1738, the son succeeded to the post. He had not  been long established in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37901"],[0,"Profitable Squab Breeding (#2)"],[1,"OF SQUAB RAISING    In another place in this book we have shown how easy it is to arrange a  place in which to keep squabs. Hundreds of people are so situated that  they could raise squabs who could not possibly take care of a flock of  chickens, because they lack both time and space.    In raising squabs the cost of attendance is reduced to the minimum.  There are no eggs to be gathered, no setting hens or incubators to be  looked after, no young birds to be fed and cared for. The pigeon-breeder  simply puts his birds in the loft, feeds and waters them and they build  their own nests and feed their young.    The space that would be needed by a dozen hens will comfortably keep  fifty or a hundred pairs of pigeons, and the revenue from a pair of  pigeons in a year is about the same as from a good laying hen.    The squab-breeder gets his money in four weeks, while the man who raises  chickens must wait at least twelve weeks before he can sell his birds.    The manure from a loft of pigeons can be sold as a garden fertilizer for  enough to pay for the cost of feeding the birds. In many cities and  towns florists consider pigeon manure the best fertilizer they can get  for flowers and garden crops and large tanneries use tons of it in  tanning leather. It usually sells for 50 cents a bushel in town for  fertilizing lawns, flower and vegetable gardens.    It will cost just about $1.00 to keep a pair of pigeons one year. When  the writer visited the great squab farms of South Jersey, he  particularly inquired about the cost of feeding a pair of pigeons one  year. In that country most of the grain is shipped from the West and  from Canada. The wheat comes from New York, Ohio, or states further  west, the kaffir corn mostly comes from Kansas and the hemp seed from  Kentucky. The peas come from Canada. All these grains are sold with the  freight added to the initial price and the feed dealer's profit, of  course. In the Mid-West the freight charges would be much smaller than  they are in the East, so the cost of keeping a pair of pigeons would be  considerably reduced.    In the South Jersey squab district we found that the cost of keeping a  pair of breeding Homers one year ranges from $1.10 to $1.25 a year. In  other sections of the country the cost runs as low as 85 cents per pair.  If a certain loft contains pigeons of extra breeding qualities, it will  cost more for feed, as the old birds have more squabs to feed than would  be the case where less productive birds were kept.    It should be understood that when we give the cost of keeping a pair of  breeding pigeons the cost of raising their squabs is included. That is  when we say it costs about $1.00 to keep a pair of pigeons a year, we  mean it will cost this amount to keep the pair and all the squabs they  produce in a year.      [Illustration: Fig. 1. A Handy, Home-made Net For Catching the Birds.]          CHAPTER II    THE BEST BREEDS FOR SQUAB RAISING--THE KIND TO BUY      In selecting a breed, the beginner is at once struck by the hundreds of  different varieties, each one with some merit, and each one put forward  by breeders of more or less reputation as the one best variety to be  handled. I believe I have thoroughly tried and tested the merits of all  the leading varieties of squab producing pigeons and right here I wish  to caution the beginner against paying fancy prices for highly  advertised cross-bred stock. There is no advantage to be gained by  crossing the blood lines of two or more varieties for breeding purposes.  This is true in pigeons the same as it is true in every other line of  pure bred stock. The best results will always be obtained by using pure  bred birds and in selecting the variety to stock your plant you must  have in mind the investment which you expect to make and the market on  which you will sell your squabs. In all cities the squabs are graded  according to size and quality and the heavier birds will bring a premium  over those of light weight but in some cases the extra heavy birds bring  such a premium that it is worth while to produce squabs of unusual size,  while in the average market the extra heavy birds bring a little more  than those of good weight but not enough to justify the increased  expense in producing them.    After an experience of twenty years in this business I do not hesitate  to say that for the general market under all conditions, the best paying  investment for the beginner is the straight American bred Homer.  Reputable breeders of this variety will furnish stock of good size and  they are the best workers and best feeders and will stand more abuse and  mistreatment than any of the other varieties I have ever handled.    Squabs from the best American bred Homers usually weigh eight and ten  pounds per dozen with occasional lofts that will produce squabs weighing  as heavy as twelve pounds to the dozen.    Inferior stock that has not been properly fed will produce squabs much  smaller than the above, but at the same time you will find their squabs  weighing six or seven pounds to the dozen. If the squabs are plump and  of good quality, they will bring a fair price.    The Homers are the fastest workers and the best feeders and they will  produce squabs under unfavorable conditions that would discourage all  other varieties. For a second selection for the experienced squab  breeder who has a market for large squabs of extra quality I would  suggest the Giant Carneaux (pronounced Karno). These birds come to us  from France and Belgium and they are a little larger than the Homers,  fast workers and produce squabs of the whitest meat. Breeding stock in  this variety is higher in price and usually costs two or three times as  much as the Homer stock, and bearing in mind the added cost of  foundation stock it would be noted at once that the returns must be  larger from this variety to justify the increased expenditure. The  Carneaux is a bold appearing, beautiful bird and comes in solid red,  solid yellow, and red and white splashed. The latter color being much  preferred by squab breeders.    The Swiss Mondaine is an extra large variety that has met with  considerable favor in this country, and the squabs from this variety  often weigh as heavy as twenty-four or thirty ounces each. These birds  very much resemble the American bred Homer in appearance except, of  course, they are much larger. They are slower workers and the squabs  require about two weeks longer to mature for market. Breeding stock is  usually quite high in price.    Duchess, Runts and Maltese Hens are all large birds and have some merit  but I have not found them as profitable as the Homers or Carneaux  because they are much slower to mature and do not breed as rapidly,  moreover the stock is much higher in price. There are many Runt-Homers,  Runt-Carneaux and other crosses on the market being widely advertised  and boosted as great squab producers, but the infusion of the blood of  any of the larger varieties is bound to make such birds slower workers  and less prolific.    Taking all of these things into consideration and as a result of many  years in the business and after carefully testing the merits of so many  varieties I must insist that the beginner will do the best with straight  American Bred Homers of the right quality, or the Giant Carneaux.      BUYING THE STOCK    Always buy of a reputable breeder whose word may be taken for the  quality of his birds. The reputable breeder sells in the hope of  selling again and sells only such birds as he can recommend and knows  will give satisfaction.    If the reputable breeder says the pair he sells are mated it may be  depended upon that there are an equal number of each sex in a purchase  and that these pairs are already mated and ready to go to work almost as  soon as they are in their new homes.    The beginner must not be impatient if the birds after shipment are a  little slow in going to work, for he must remember that many of these  birds have been taken from their nests and their young and shipped many  miles with indifferent care en-route and some of the matings may have  been more or less broken up. Many beginners fuss too much with their  birds and disturb them until the birds have little chance to settle down  in their new homes and go to work. If you provide clean fresh water and  feed as directed in this book and leave the birds to themselves they  will soon be working.    Some very reputable breeders sell young birds with the understanding  that they are sold just as they come from the nests, the buyer knowing  when he buys these birds that they are not mated and that he must wait  until the birds have arrived at mating age and get ready to mate  themselves.    When birds are bought just as they come from the nests, there are always  more cocks than hens among them, as about nine times in ten when only  one bird is reared in a nest that bird is a cock; but there is nothing  unfair in this sort of sale, as the buyer gets his birds at a lower  price than he would have to pay for mated pairs ready to go to work.    If it should be found when the birds are settled to work in their new  home that some mistake has been made in selecting mated pairs and odd  birds are found in the loft any reputable breeder will furnish birds of  the opposite sex to mate with these odd birds at a reduced price, so the  purchaser will have nothing but mated and working pairs for his money.      WHAT IS MEANT BY MATED PAIRS    When we say mated pairs, we do not mean simply an equal number of birds  of each sex. We mean pairs which have mated and married and are ready to  go to work and rear squabs without further waiting after they have been  received. Pigeons mate in pairs and remain constant to each other for  life, as a rule. Matings are some times broken by the birds themselves  especially when some accident has befallen the young in the nest, or  when the birds are being"]]]
