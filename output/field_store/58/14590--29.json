It was a night in       which to wish it might never be day again--a night to be       enamored of the stars, and bid God bless them like human       creatures on their bright journey--a night to love in, to       dissolve in--to do every thing but what night is made       for--sleep! Oh heaven! when I think how precious is life in       such moments; how the aroma--the celestial bloom and flower       of the soul--the yearning and fast-perishing enthusiasm of       youth--waste themselves in the solitude of such nights on       the senseless and unanswering air; when I wander alone,       unloving and unloved, beneath influences that could inspire       me with the elevation of a seraph, were I at the ear of a       human creature that could summon forth and measure my       limitless capacity of devotion--when I think this, and feel       this, and so waste my existence in vain yearnings--I could       extinguish the divine spark within me like a lamp on an       unvisited shrine, and thank Heaven for an assimilation to       the animals I walk among! And that is the substance of a       speech I made to Job as a sequitur of a well-meant remark of       his own, that 'it was a pity Edith Linsey was not there.' He       took the clause about the 'animals' to himself, and I made       an apology for the same a year after. We sometimes give our       friends, quite innocently, such terrible knocks in our       rhapsodies!         \"Most people talk of the _sublimity_ of Trenton, but I have       haunted it by the week together for its mere loveliness. The       river, in the heart of that fearful chasm, is the most       varied and beautiful assemblage of the thousand forms and       shapes of running water that I know in the world. The soil       and the deep-striking roots of the forest terminate far       above you, looking like a black rim on the inclosing       precipices; the bed of the river and its sky-sustaining       walls are of solid rock, and, with the tremendous descent of       the stream--forming for miles one continuous succession of       falls and rapids--the channel is worn into curves and       cavities which throw the clear waters into forms of       inconceivable brilliancy and variety. It is a sort of half       twilight below, with here and there a long beam of sunshine       reaching down to kiss the lip of an eddy or form a rainbow       over a fall, and the reverberating and changing echoes:--            \"Like a ring of bells whose sound the wind still alters,\"         maintain a constant and most soothing music, varying at       every step with the varying phase of the current. Cascades       of from twenty to thirty feet, over which the river flies       with a single and hurrying leap (not a drop missing from the       glassy and bending sheet), occur frequently as you ascend;       and it is from these that the place takes its name. But the       falls, though beautiful, are only peculiar from the dazzling       and unequaled rapidity with which the waters come to the       leap. If it were not for the leaf which drops wavering down       into the abysm from trees apparently painted on the sky, and       which is caught away by the flashing current as if the       lightning had suddenly crossed it, you would think the vault       of the steadfast heavens a flying element as soon. The spot       in that long gulf of beauty that I best remember is a smooth       descent of some hundred yards, where the river in full and       undivided volume skims over a plane as polished as a table       of scagliola, looking, in its invisible speed, like one       mirror of gleaming but motionless crystal. Just above, there       is a sudden turn in the glen which sends the water like a       catapult against the opposite angle of the rock, and, in the       action of years, it has worn out a cavern of unknown depth,       into which the whole mass of the river plunges with the       abandonment of a flying fiend into hell, and, reappearing       like the angel that has pursued him, glides swiftly but with       divine serenity on its way. (I am indebted for that last       figure to Job, who travelled with a Milton in his pocket,       and had a natural redolence of 'Paradise Lost' in his       conversation.)         \"Much as I detest water in small quantities (to drink), I       have a hydromania in the way of lakes, rivers, and       waterfalls. It is, by much, the _belle_ in the family of the       elements. _Earth_ is never tolerable unless disguised in       green. _Air_ is so thin as only to be visible when she       borrows drapery of water; and _Fire_ is so staringly bright       as to be unpleasant to the eyesight; but water! soft, pure,       graceful water! there is no shape into which you can throw       her that she does not seem lovelier than before. She can       borrow nothing of her sisters. Earth has no jewels in her       lap so brilliant as her own spray pearls and emeralds; Fire       has no rubies like what she steals from the sunset; Air has       no robes like the grace of her fine-woven and ever-changing       drapery of silver. A health (in wine!) to WATER!    [Illustration]         \"Who is there that did not love some stream in his youth?       Who is there in whose vision of the past there does not       sparkle up, from every picture of childhood, a spring or a       rivulent woven through the darkened and torn woof of first       affections like a thread of unchanged silver? How do you       interpret the instinctive yearning with which you search for       the river-side or the fountain in every scene of nature--the       clinging unaware to the river's course when a truant in the       fields in June--the dull void you find in every landscape of       which it is not the ornament and the centre? For myself, I       hold with the Greek: \"Water is the first principle of all       things: we were made from it and we shall be resolved into       it.\"\"    [Illustration]    Of subsequent visits to this loveliest of spots, years after, Mr.  Willis has given descriptions in letters addressed to General Morris  for publication in the _Home Journal_, and we are soon to have from  Putnam in a beautiful volume all that he has written on the subject,  together with notices of the manner in which he enjoyed himself at Mr.  Moore's delightful hotel at the Falls, which is represented as  farthest of all summer resorts from the turmoil of the world and  nearest of all to the gates of Paradise. We borrow from these letters  a few characteristic and tempting paragraphs:         \"I was here twenty years ago, but the fairest things slip       easiest out of the memory, and I had half forgotten Trenton.       To tell the truth, I was a little ashamed, to compare the       faded and shabby picture of it in my mind with the reality       before me, and if the waters of the Falls had been, by any       likelihood, the same that flowed over when I was here       before, I should have looked them in the face, I think, with       something of the embarrassment with which one meets,       half-rememberingly, after years of separation, the ladies       one has vowed to love for ever.         \"The peculiarity of Trenton Falls, I fancy, consists a good       deal in the space in which you are compelled to see them.       You walk a few steps from the hotel through the wood, and       come to a descending staircase of a hundred steps, the       different bends of which are so over-grown with wild       shrubbery, that you cannot see the ravine till you are       fairly down upon its rocky floor. Your path hence, up to the       first Fall, is along a ledge cut out of the base of the       cliff that overhangs the torrent, and when you go to the       foot of the descending sheet, you find yourself in very       close quarters with a cataract--rocky walls all round       you--and the appreciation of power and magnitude, perhaps,       somewhat heightened by the confinement of the place--as a       man would have a much more realizing sense of a live lion,       shut up with him in a basement parlor, than he would of the       same object, seen from an elevated and distant point of       view.         \"The usual walk (through this deep cave open at the top) is       about half a mile in length, and its almost subterranean       river, in that distance, plunges over four precipices in       exceedingly beautiful cascades. On the successive rocky       terraces between the falls, the torrent takes every variety       of rapids and whirlpools, and, perhaps, in all the scenery       of the world, there is no river, which, in the same space,       presents so many of the various shapes and beauties of       running and falling water. The Indian name of the stream       (the Kanata, which means the _amber river_) expresses one of       its peculiarities, and, probably from the depth of shade       cast by the two dark and overhanging walls 'twixt which it       flows, the water is everywhere of a peculiarly rich lustre       and color, and, in the edges of one or two of the cascades,       as yellow as gold. Artists, in drawing this river, fail,       somehow, in giving the impression of _deep-down-itude_ which       is produced by the close approach of the two lofty walls of       rock, capped by the overleaning woods, and with the sky       apparently resting, like a ceiling, upon the leafy       architraves.... If there were truly, as the poets say       figuratively, \"worlds _within_ worlds,\" this would look as       if an earthquake had cracked open the outer globe, and       exposed, through the yawning fissure, one of the rivers of       the globe below--the usual underground level of \"down among       the dead men,\" being, as you walk upon its banks, between       you and the daylight.         \"Considering the amount of surprise and pleasure which one       feels"]]]
