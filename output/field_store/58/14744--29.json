Ridicule has laughed at it; Satire has mocked it; Bigotry has  refused to hear its defense; Hatred has slandered it; Intolerance has  armed the red, right hind of persecution against it; the Government  of the United States has seized upon and escheated its property; Mob  Violence has opposed its promulgation by murdering its missionaries  and driving its devotees from city to city, from county to county,  from state to state; and the Civil Authorities refusing the protection  guaranteed alike in state and national constitutions, at last permitted  those who accepted its faith to be exiled from their native country.    \"Mormonism,\" however, has survived not only the violence which murdered  its prophets, burned the houses of the Saints, laid waste their fields  and destroyed their temples, but also an exodus which, for the distance  covered and the dangers encountered, has not a parallel in ancient or  modern history. Its followers settling in a desert land a thousand  miles from the frontiers of civilization, like drilled cohorts made  war upon the sterile elements of the inter-Rocky Mountain region, and  like magic there sprang into existence, as the result of their untiring  efforts and divine blessing, cities, towns, hamlets; temples, churches,  schoolhouses; peaceful homes surrounded by fruitful fields and  gardens and orchards, which, with the peace and good order everywhere  prevailing, challenge the admiration of all who become acquainted with  the Saints and the land they inhabit.    Meantime, the Elders of the Church, full of sublime faith and trust in  God, without purse or scrip, have visited nearly all the nations of the  earth and have preached the gospel to them. Not, perhaps, with that  nice skill and polish which refined education in renowned institutions  of learning may give, but in the power and demonstration of God's Holy  Spirit; and nearly every nation under the whole heaven has given to the  new faith some of its sons and daughters. By reason of this missionary  work \"Mormonism\" is becoming recognized in the earth as one of the  potent religious forces of the age, and as such claims the right to  be heard in this Parliament, in giving expression to its faith and  distinguishing characteristics.    \"Mormonism,\" like all religions which have any hold either upon the  intelligence or affections of men, has, as its foundation principle,  faith in God, the Creator of heaven and earth and the Power by  which they are sustained. But \"Mormonism\" not only believes in this  fundamental truth of all religions, but it has another belief equal  unto it, viz., that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and who through the  atonement made by him on Calvary, is the Savior of the world. These two  personages and the Holy Ghost, that divine Spirit which bears, record  of God and operates throughout the universe as his witness and agent,  constitute the God-head--the Holy Trinity, the Grand Presidency of  heaven and earth. In attributes, in purpose, in will, these three are  one; perfectly united in mind and action.    To this great Presidency, \"Mormonism\" teaches that man owes praise,  adoration, and as best of all worship--obedience; for submission of  the mind and the will to God, is alone true worship. Such a result  as this can only be obtained through faith, for he who cometh thus  to God must believe that he is. But the evidences of God's existence  are so overwhelming that none shall be able to find an excuse for  unbelief. Such evidences are to be found in the works of God as seen  in the works of nature. The orderly procession of the seasons proclaim  it; and when man uplifts his eyes from earth to the dome of heaven  stretched above him, he beholds, like the Psalmist, the evidences of  God's existence and of his majesty and glory. The unbroken line of  testimony of prophets and righteous men as recorded in the Jewish  Scriptures, both in the old and New Testament, bear witness of it.  But to this testimony, the common inheritance of all Christendom,  \"Mormonism\" adds special evidences of its own. It has prophets, who,  through righteousness and faith, coupled with the grace of God, have  stood in his presence, heard his voice, and beheld in part, his glory.  They bear record that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ; and that  testimony, like the ancient prophets, they have sealed with their blood.    To the volume of Jewish scripture \"Mormonism\" adds a volume equal in  bulk and equal in importance to the New Testament--the Book of Mormon.  This book is an abridgement of more extensive records kept by the  ancient inhabitants of the western hemisphere, the existence of which  was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith by the ministry of an angel  and translated by him into the English language by means of the Urim  and Thummim hidden with the golden plates upon which the record was  engraven.    From this new volume of scripture we learn that the mercies and favors  of God are not confined to the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere;  but he of whom it is said that he is \"no respecter of persons,\" had  regard for the races of men who inhabited the western half of the  world. He raised up wise men and prophets among them to whom he  revealed his will, made known his purposes concerning the creation of  man, and taught him the way of life. Previous to the coming of the  Son of God in the flesh, their prophets taught this ancient people as  Isaiah, Jeremiah and others taught the Jews, to look forward to the  coming of Messiah, to make an atonement for the sins of the world.  And when Jesus had completed his mission to the Jews in Palestine, in  fulfilment of his own prophecy which says, \"I lay down my life for  the sheep; and other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them  also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be  one fold and one shepherd,\"--in fulfilment of this, I say, he visited  the land of America, revealed himself to the people, taught the same  divine truths which warmed the hearts and purified the lives of men of  good will in Palestine; gave them the same ordinances of salvation;  and organized the church in their midst for their instruction in  righteousness.    Of these things their poets sang, their prophets wrote; and when,  through wickedness, anarchy overthrew their civilization, righteous men  hid away their records that in the last days they might come forth and  be united with the testimony of prophets and men of God who had lived  in other lands; to the end that the evidences of God's existence, the  Messiahship of Jesus Christ, and the truth of the gospel might be so  increased that unbelief would have no excuse for its infidelity; and  that they who scoff at faith might be reproved and learn to believe.    One thing has occurred to me while in attendance at this Parliament  which has raised in importance the humble part allotted to me in it;  and that is, while we have heard from this platform voices from all  nations and races of men--voices from Asia, from Europe, from Africa  and the islands of the sea; we have had voices from the dead religions  and the living religions, and they have united in saying that in all  these lands and in all ages God has not left himself without witnesses  among them, but has raised up prophets among them who taught them at  least some measure of the truth--perhaps all they could accept and  incorporate in their lives. But where is the voice to tell us that God  remembered the races and nations which flourished for ages throughout  this whole western hemisphere before Europeans discovered it? Races  that had attained a high state of civilization, too, as proclaimed by  the ruins of their temples and cities. Are we to suppose that they  were without God while all the rest of mankind found him? Perish the  thought. If no other voice is to be heard proclaiming that God was just  and merciful to these races, and that he revealed himself to them--then  let the pleasing task be mine, and here in this august presence I  proclaim the revelation of their record which bears witness of God's  goodness to them; and that record is the Book of Mormon.    A word further in regard to that book. Men have usually satisfied  themselves as to its origin by accepting that flimsiest of all theories  that it was the production of one Rev. Solomon Spaulding, who wrote it  as a romance. This theory of its origin, without any investigation, has  generally satisfied those who have heard it. In 1886, however, the long  lost manuscript of the Rev. Mr. Spaulding unexpectedly came to light,  has been identified beyond the peradventure of a doubt, and is now in  the possession of President James H. Fairchild of Oberlin College,  Ohio, or rather is in the museum of that institution for the inspection  of all. It has been published by the Church, every word of it, with  even the erasures made by its author so far as they can be deciphered,  and lo there is not an incident, not a circumstance, not a proper  name either of place or person, nor any similarity of construction or  purpose common to the Book of Mormon and Mr. Spaulding's production.  President Fairchild himself says that whatever theory shall be put  forth for the origin of the Book of Mormon, the Spaulding theory must  be abandoned.    By accepting the records of the ancient peoples of America the  \"Mormons\" have double the amount of evidence for the existence of God  and the truth of the gospel that other people possess; and since faith  must ever have its foundation in evidence, the enlarged evidences  accepted by \"Mormons\" must account for that mightier faith which both  their sufferings and their works proclaim they possess.    In \"Mormon\" theology the atonement of Jesus Christ redeems all mankind  from the consequences of Adam's transgression,"]]]
