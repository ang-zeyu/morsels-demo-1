We have, in  the first rank, the couch-grass, that execrable weed which three years  of stubborn warfare have not succeeded in exterminating. Next, in  respect of number, come the centauries, grim-looking one and all,  bristling with prickles or starry halberds. They are the  yellow-flowered centaury, the mountain centaury, the star-thistle and  the rough centaury: the first predominates. Here and there, amid their  inextricable confusion, stands, like a chandelier with spreading orange  flowers for lights, the fierce Spanish oyster-plant, whose spikes are  strong as nails. Above it towers the Illyrian cotton-thistle, whose  straight and solitary stalk soars to a height of three to six feet and  ends in large pink tufts. Its armour hardly yields before that of the  oyster-plant. Nor must we forget the lesser thistle-tribe, with, first  of all, the prickly or \"cruel\" thistle, which is so well armed that the  plant-collector knows not where to grasp it; next, the spear-thistle,  with its ample foliage, ending each of its veins with a spear-head;  lastly, the black knap-weed, which gathers itself into a spiky knot. In  among these, in long lines armed with hooks, the shoots of the blue  dewberry creep along the ground. To visit the prickly thicket when the  Wasp goes foraging, you must wear boots that come to mid-leg or else  resign yourself to a smarting in the calves. As long as the ground  retains a few remnants of the vernal rains, this rude vegetation does  not lack a certain charm, when the pyramids of the oyster-plant and the  slender branches of the cotton-thistle rise above the wide carpet  formed by the yellow-flowered centaury's saffron heads; but let the  droughts of summer come and we see but a desolate waste, which the  flame of a match would set ablaze from one end to the other. Such is,  or rather was, when I took possession of it, the Eden of bliss where I  mean to live henceforth alone with the insect. Forty years of desperate  struggle have won it for me.    Eden, I said; and, from the point of view that interests me, the  expression is not out of place. This cursed ground, which no one would  have had at a gift to sow with a pinch of turnip-seed, is an earthly  paradise for the Bees and the Wasps. Its mighty growth of thistles and  centauries draws them all to me from everywhere around. Never, in my  insect-hunting memories, have I seen so large a population at a single  spot; all the trades have made it their rallying-point. Here come  hunters of every kind of game, builders in clay, weavers of cotton  goods, collectors of pieces cut from a leaf or the petals of a flower,  architects in paste-board, plasterers mixing mortar, carpenters boring  wood, miners digging underground galleries, workers handling  goldbeater's skin and many more.    Who is this one? An Anthidium. (A Cotton-bee.--Translator's Note.) She  scrapes the cobwebby stalk of the yellow-flowered centaury and gathers  a ball of wadding which she carries off proudly in the tips of her  mandibles. She will turn it, under ground, into cotton-felt satchels to  hold the store of honey and the egg. And these others, so eager for  plunder? They are Megachiles (Leaf-cutting Bees.--Translator's Note.),  carrying under their bellies their black, white, or blood-red  reaping-brushes. They will leave the thistles to visit the neighbouring  shrubs and there cut from the leaves oval pieces which will be made  into a fit receptacle to contain the harvest. And these, clad in black  velvet? They are Chalicodomae (Mason-bees.--Translator's Note.), who  work with cement and gravel. We could easily find their masonry on the  stones in the harmas. And these, noisily buzzing with a sudden flight?  They are the Anthophorae (a species of Wild Bees.--Translator's Note.),  who live in the old walls and the sunny banks of the neighbourhood.    Now come the Osmiae. One stacks her cells in the spiral staircase of an  empty snail-shell; another, attacking the pith of a dry bit of bramble,  obtains for her grubs a cylindrical lodging and divides it into floors  by means of partition-walls; a third employs the natural channel of a  cut reed; a fourth is a rent-free tenant of the vacant galleries of  some Mason-bee. Here are the Macrocerae and the Eucerae, whose males  are proudly horned; the Dasypodae, who carry an ample brush of bristles  on their hind-legs for a reaping implement; the Andrenae, so manyfold  in species; the slender-bellied Halicti. (Osmiae, Macrocerae, Eucerae,  Dasypodae, Andrenae, and Halicti are all different species of Wild  Bees.--Translator's Note.) I omit a host of others. If I tried to  continue this record of the guests of my thistles, it would muster  almost the whole of the honey-yielding tribe. A learned entomologist of  Bordeaux, Professor Perez, to whom I submit the naming of my prizes,  once asked me if I had any special means of hunting, to send him so  many rarities and even novelties. I am not at all an experienced and  still less a zealous hunter, for the insect interests me much more when  engaged in its work than when stuck on a pin in a cabinet. The whole  secret of my hunting is reduced to my dense nursery of thistles and  centauries.    By a most fortunate chance, with this populous family of  honey-gatherers was allied the whole hunting tribe. The builders' men  had distributed here and there, in the harmas, great mounds of sand and  heaps of stones, with a view of running up some surrounding walls. The  work dragged on slowly; and the materials found occupants from the  first year. The Mason-bees had chosen the interstices between the  stones as a dormitory where to pass the night in serried groups. The  powerful Eyed Lizard, who, when close-pressed, attacks wide-mouthed  both man and dog, had selected a cave wherein to lie in wait for the  passing Scarab (A Dung-beetle known also as the Sacred  Beetle.--Translator's Note.); the Black-eared Chat, garbed like a  Dominican, white-frocked with black wings, sat on the top stone,  singing his short rustic lay: his nest, with its sky-blue eggs, must be  somewhere in the heap. The little Dominican disappeared with the loads  of stones. I regret him: he would have been a charming neighbour. The  Eyed Lizard I do not regret at all.    The sand sheltered a different colony. Here, the Bembeces (A species of  Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.) were sweeping the threshold of their  burrows, flinging a curve of dust behind them; the Languedocian Sphex  was dragging her Ephippigera (A species of Green  Grasshopper--Translator's Note.) by the antennae; a Stizus (A species  of Hunting-wasp.--Translator's Note.) was storing her preserves of  Cicadellae. (Froghoppers--Translator's Note.) To my sorrow, the masons  ended by evicting the sporting tribe; but, should I ever wish to recall  it, I have but to renew the mounds of sand: they will soon all be  there.    Hunters that have not disappeared, their homes being different, are the  Ammophilae, whom I see fluttering, one in spring, the others in autumn,  along the garden-walks and over the lawns, in search of a caterpillar;  the Pompili (The Pompilus is a species of Hunting-wasp known also as  the Ringed Calicurgus--Translator's Note.), who travel alertly, beating  their wings and rummaging in every corner in quest of a Spider. The  largest of them waylays the Narbonne Lycosa (Known also as the  Black-bellied Tarantula--Translator's Note.), whose burrow is not  infrequent in the harmas. This burrow is a vertical well, with a curb  of fescue-grass intertwined with silk. You can see the eyes of the  mighty Spider gleam at the bottom of the den like little diamonds, an  object of terror to most. What a prey and what dangerous hunting for  the Pompilus! And here, on a hot summer afternoon, is the Amazon-ant,  who leaves her barrack-rooms in long battalions and marches far afield  to hunt for slaves. We will follow her in her raids when we find time.  Here again, around a heap of grasses turned to mould, are Scoliae  (Large Hunting-wasps--Translator's Note.) an inch and a half long, who  fly gracefully and dive into the heap, attracted by a rich prey, the  grubs of Lamellicorns, Oryctes, and Cetoniae. (Different species of  Beetles. The Cetonia is the Rose-chafer--Translator's Note.)    What subjects for study! And there are more to come. The house was as  utterly deserted as the ground. When man was gone and peace assured,  the animal hastily seized on everything. The Warbler took up his abode  in the lilac-shrubs; the Greenfinch settled in the thick shelter of the  cypresses; the Sparrow carted rags and straw under every slate; the  Serin-finch, whose downy nest is no bigger than half an apricot, came  and chirped in the plane-tree tops; the Scops made a habit of uttering  his monotonous, piping note here, of an evening; the bird of Pallas  Athene, the Owl, came hurrying along to hoot and hiss.    In front of the house is a large pond, fed by the aqueduct that  supplies the village pumps with water. Here, from half a mile and more  around, come the Frogs and Toads in the lovers' season. The Natterjack,  sometimes as large as a plate, with a narrow stripe of yellow down his  back, makes his appointments here to take his bath; when the evening  twilight falls, we see hopping along the edge the Midwife Toad, the  male, who carries a cluster of eggs, the size of peppercorns, wrapped  round his hind-legs: the genial paterfamilias has brought his precious  packet from afar, to leave it in the water and afterwards retire under  some flat stone, whence he will emit a sound like a tinkling bell.  Lastly, when not croaking amid the foliage, the Tree-frogs indulge in  the most graceful dives. And so, in May, as soon as it is dark, the  pond becomes a deafening orchestra: it is impossible to talk at table,  impossible to sleep. We had to remedy this by means perhaps a little  too rigorous.

Similarly, _Terrapene klauberi_  (southern Sonora) and _T. nelsoni_ (Tepic, Nayarit--known from a  single adult male) are closely related but are considered distinct  because of their morphological differences and widely separated known  ranges. _Terrapene coahuila_, so far found only in the basin of Cuatro  CiA(C)negas in central Coahuila, is the most primitive _Terrapene_ known;  it differs from other box turtles in a number of morphological  characters and is the only member of the genus that is chiefly  aquatic.    Two species of _Terrapene_ occur in the United States. _Terrapene  carolina_, having four recognized subspecies, has a nearly continuous  distribution from southern Maine, southern Michigan, and southern  Wisconsin, southward to Florida and the Gulf coast and westward to  southeastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas, and  characteristically inhabits wooded areas.    _Terrapene ornata_ is a characteristic inhabitant of the western  prairies of the United States, and ranges from western and southern  Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, and all but the extreme eastern part of  Texas, westward to southeastern Wyoming, eastern Colorado, eastern and  southern New Mexico, and southern Arizona, and, from southern South  Dakota and southern Wisconsin, southward to northern Mexico (Fig. 1).  It is the only species of the genus that occurs in both Mexico and the  United States. The northeasternmost populations of _T. ornata_,  occurring in small areas of prairie in Indiana and Illinois, seem to  be isolated from the main range of the species. The ranges of _T.  ornata_ and _T. carolina_ overlap in the broad belt of prairie-forest  ecotone in the central United States. Interspecific matings under  laboratory conditions are not uncommon and several verbal reports of  such matings under natural conditions have reached me. Nevertheless,  after examining many specimens of both species and all alleged  \"hybrids\" recorded in the literature, I find no convincing evidence  that hybridization occurs under natural conditions.    _Terrapene ornata_ differs from _T. carolina_ in having a low,  flattened carapace lacking a middorsal keel (carapace highly arched  and distinctly keeled in _carolina_), and in having four claws on the  hind foot (three or four in _carolina_), the claw of the first toe of  males being widened, thickened, and turned in (first toe not thus  modified in _carolina_). _Terrapene ornata_ is here considered to be  the most specialized member of the genus by virtue of its reduced  phalangeal formula, lightened, relatively loosely articulated shell,  reduced plastron, and lightly built skull, which completely lacks  quadratojugal bones (Fig. 2); most of these specializations seem to be  associated with adaptation for terrestrial existence in open habitats.       [Illustration: FIG. 1. Geographic distribution of _Terrapene         ornata_. Solid symbols indicate the known range of _T. o.         ornata_ and hollow symbols the known range of _T. o. luteola_.         Half-circles show the approximate range of intergradation         between the two subspecies. Triangles indicate localities         recorded in literature; specimens were examined from all other         localities shown. Only peripheral localities are shown on the         map.]    Two subspecies of _T. ornata_ an recognized. _Terrapene o. luteola_,  Smith and Ramsey (1952), ranges from northern Sonora (Guaymas) and  southern Arizona (southern Pima County) eastward to southeastern New  Mexico and Trans-Pecos, Texas, where it intergrades with _T. o.  ornata_; the latter subspecies is not yet known from Mexico but almost  surely occurs in the northeastern part of that country. The subspecies  _luteola_ differs from _ornata_ in being slightly larger and in having  more pale radiations on the shell (11 to 14 radiations on the second  lateral lamina in _luteola_, five to eight in _ornata_). In  individuals of _luteola_ the markings of the shell become less  distinct with advancing age and eventually are lost; shells of most  old individuals are uniform straw color or pale greenish-brown; this  change in coloration does not occur in _T. o. ornata_.       [Illustration: FIG. 2. Dorsal and lateral views of skull of         _T. o. ornata_ (_a_ and _b_) (KU 1172, male, from 6 ml. S.

Note the         relatively higher brain-case and the incomplete zygomatic         arch in _T. o. ornata_. All figures natural size.]      Fossils    Of the several species of fossil _Terrapene_ described (Hay,  1908b:359-367, Auffenberg, 1958), most are clearly allied to Recent  _T. carolina_. One species, _Terrapene longinsulae_ Hay,  (1908a:166-168, Pl. 26) from \"... the Upper Miocene or Lower  Pliocene....\" of Phillips County, Kansas, however, is closely related  to _T. ornata_ (if not identical). I have examined the type specimen  of _T. longinsulae_. Stock and Bode (1936:234, Pl. 8) reported _T.  ornata_ from sub-Recent deposits near Clovis, Curry County, New  Mexico.      Economic Importance    Ornate box turtles, referred to as \"land terrapins\" or \"land  tortoises\" over most of the range of the species, are regarded by most  persons whom I have queried as innocuous. These turtles occasionally  damage garden crops and have been known to eat the eggs of upland game  birds. _Terrapene ornata_ is seldom used for food. A. B. Leonard told  me the species was eaten occasionally by Arapaho Indians in Dewey  County, Oklahoma. Several specimens in the University of Kansas  Archeological Collections were found in Indian middens in Rice County,  Kansas, from a culture dated approximately 1500 to 1600 A. D. The  flesh of _T. ornata_ occasionally may be toxic if the turtle has eaten  toxic fungi as has been recorded for _T. carolina_ (Carr, 1952:147).      Study Areas    Preliminary studies and collections of specimens were made at a number  of localities in northeastern Kansas in 1953 and 1954. Two small areas  were finally selected for more intensive study. One of these areas,  the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, five and  one-half miles north-northeast of Lawrence in the northeasternmost  section of Douglas County, Kansas, is a tract of 590 acres maintained  as a natural area for biological investigations. Slightly less than  two thirds (338 acres) of the Reservation is wooded; the remainder  consists of open areas having vegetation ranging from undisturbed  prairie grassland to weedy, partly brushy fields (Fitch, 1952).  Although ornate box turtles were not numerous at the Reservation, the  area was selected for study because: 1) there was a minimum of  interference there from man and none from domestic animals; 2) the  vegetation of the Reservation is typical of areas where _T. ornata_  and _T. carolina_ occur sympatrically (actually only one specimen of  _T. carolina_ has been seen at the Reservation); and, 3) availability  of biological and climatological data there greatly facilitated the  present study. Actual field work at the Reservation consisted of  studies of hibernation and long-term observations on movements of a  few box turtles.    A much larger number of individuals was intensively studied on a tract  of land, owned by Sophia Damm, situated 12 miles west and one and  one-half miles north of Lawrence in the northwestern quarter of  Douglas County, Kansas. The Damm Farm lies on the southern slope of a  prominence--extending northwestward from Lawrence to Topeka--that  separates the Kansas River Valley from the watershed of the Wakarusa  River to the south. The prominence has an elevation of approximately  1100 feet and is dissected on both sides by small valleys draining  into the two larger river valleys.    The Damm Farm (see Pl. 15) has a total area of approximately 220  acres. The crest of a hill extends diagonally from the middle of the  northern edge approximately two thirds of the distance to the  southwestern corner. Another hill is in the extreme northwestern  corner of the study area.    The northeastern 22 acres were wooded and had small patches of  overgrazed pasture. Trees in the wooded area were Black Walnut  (_Juglans nigra_), Elms (_Ulmus americana_, _U. rubra_), Cottonwood  (_Populus deltoides_), and Northern Prickly Ash (_Xanthoxylum  americanum_). The areas used as pasture had thick growths of Buckbush  (_Symphoricarpos orbiculatus_) mixed with short grasses (_Bromus  japonicus_, _Muhlenbergia Schreberi_, and _Poa pratensis_). Farm  buildings were situated in the wooded area at the end of an entry  road. The southeastern 74 acres were cultivated; corn, wheat, and milo  were grown here and fallow fields had a sparse growth of weeds.    Most of the western two thirds of the study area, comprising 124  acres, was open rolling prairie (hereafter referred to as \"pasture\")  upon which beef-cattle were grazed (Pl. 16, Fig. 1; Pl. 17, Fig. 1;  Pl. 18, Fig. 2). Rock fences (Pl. 17, Fig. 2) two to four feet high  bordered the northern edge, southern edge, and one half of western  edge of the pasture. A wagon track lead from a gate on the entry road,  along the crest of the hill, to a gate in the southern fence. Except  for the latter gate and for ocassional under-cut places in low areas,  there were no openings in the rock fences through which box turtles  could pass. A few trees--American Elm, Hackberry (_Celtis  occidentalis_), Red Mulberry (_Morus rubra_), Osage Orange (_Maclura  pomifera_), Black Cherry (_Prunus serotina_), Box-Elder (_Acer  Negundo_), and Dogwood (_Cornus Drummondi_)--were scattered along  fences at the borders of the pasture and in ravines.
