The unfortunate part is, that  foolish and inexperienced people often inflict misery upon innocent  persons; unintentionally, it is true: but they are none the less guilty.  Firearms should be looked upon as a kind of machinery, which no one in  his senses would attempt to handle unless he knew the use of them.    The abominable practice of those to whom firearms belong, or those in  the charge or care thereof, of keeping or leaving such weapons loaded,  so that they may at any moment fall into the hands of children, or  perhaps, what is worse still, inexperienced adults, is most seriously to  be condemned, and may be designated really as a criminal act, which  ought to be summarily punished.    It is an act which has no real motive, no real _bona fide_ object, and  is lawless and idle in the extreme,--an act which has resulted in the  death of its thousands, and the maiming of even more.    A weapon should never be brought within the portals of a man's house  loaded; the breech-loading cartridge can be easily withdrawn. If the  piece is a muzzle-loader it should be discharged after the day's sport  is over; ammunition is really not so very costly as to require to be  husbanded at the probable cost of a serious accident, or perhaps a  fellow-creature's life. This rule cannot be too strictly adhered to.  Some years ago it was my lot to be staying with a gentleman of eccentric  habits, a man of violent temper, and when in one of these fits really  not answerable for his actions. I was aware that he kept a full-sized  revolver loaded with ball, and capped, in his dressing-room. I confess I  was coward enough to let this matter trouble me. I felt I could stand up  and face death with any one in the field, fighting in a good cause and  armed as others; but to be taken advantage of at any moment, and  perhaps shot down like a dog, was rather too much. I therefore resolved  in my own mind, not only to disarm my friend but to render his weapon  useless; but how to accomplish this was the question, as to raise any  suspicion would perhaps bring down wrath upon my own head. I therefore  resolved to leave everything precisely intact till an opportunity should  present itself. The very next day the time arrived, and during this  Grand Turk's absence I hastily removed the caps from off the nipples of  the revolver, and having exploded them upon the nipples of his  double-barrelled gun, I pinched them back into their original shape and  replaced them on the revolver. I then put the box of caps into my pocket  and felt perfectly secure, and could have sat and been fired at without  the slightest fear. This gentleman shortly afterwards was seized with  paralysis of the brain, and ended his days in a madhouse. No one, I  believe, ever suffered any inconvenience from the revolver, and what  became of it I know not.    If leaving weapons about is necessary (which I do not for a moment  admit), then most assuredly they should be rendered harmless by being  left unloaded, and thus the means of rendering them destructive would be  kept out of the way of meddlers. All ammunition should, as a rule, be  kept in some secret and safe place, and always under lock and key. Every  man knows that edged tools are dangerous, consequently that the leaving  loaded firearms within the reach of anybody who may chance to come  across them is simply leaving means of destruction unprotected, and he  should bear in mind that this mischief of his own neglect might  accidentally at any moment be wielded against himself.              'How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds,             Makes deeds ill done.                                   SHAKESPEARE: _King John._    The responsibility of those possessing firearms is great, and proper  precautions and proper care cannot be too strictly enforced. Care costs  nothing, and may be the means of preventing loss of life and many a  deplorable accident. The precautions necessary to be borne in mind in  the safe use of firearms for one's own protection, as well as the  protection of others, are voluminous, and so varied are they that it is  with difficulty they can be all dealt with in this little treatise; it  is only therefore proposed to mention some of them, and detail a few  important hints for the guidance of the unwary. Generally speaking, if a  man will not exercise a little gumption, care, and discretion, when in  the society of a shooting-party similarly armed as he is himself, he  must put up with the consequences. Accidents in properly regulated  families should never happen. Since the introduction of the  breech-loader there is no excuse for any man carrying a loaded weapon  and swinging the muzzle of it about when carrying it on his shoulder  (which is often done), bringing every one in his rear in the line of  fire of the piece. A man can load his piece now when he arrives upon the  ground in a moment; and should a bird rise, with the present facilities  given by the breech-loader, there is ample time to load and bring the  bird down without the slightest difficulty. For any man therefore, when  not in the field, to strut about with a loaded weapon in his possession  now-a-days is simply bombastic tomfoolery.    To carry a gun gracefully and properly is an art. It should never be so  carried or wielded as to be a risk to the possessor, or any one. The  following are a few ways how a gun should be carried:--For safety, when  commencing sport, the right hand grasping the piece at the small of the  butt, the butt resting on the right hip or thigh, muzzle up. The weapon  can then, on the rising of game, be at once safely presented.    When carried on the shoulder it should be always with _lock down_: this  mode will so elevate the barrels that the muzzles are far above the  heads of any one; even when at close quarters, on the march, or when  approaching or returning from cover, this way will be found easiest and  with the least possible fatigue, as the weight of the weapon is centered  in the stock held in the right hand. To relieve the shoulder pass the  hand up to the small, or neck of the butt; at the same time seize the  butt with the left hand, then raise your gun to a perpendicular  position, carry it across the body, and place it on the left shoulder.  The left shoulder can be relieved in a similar manner, _i.e._, pass the  left hand to the small or neck of the butt, at the same time seize the  butt with the right hand, raise the gun to a perpendicular position, and  carry it across the body and place it on the right shoulder. Never  present, much less fire, when any person, whether keeper or beater,  intervenes or is near the bird. Never fire over any one, even if he what  is called 'ducks,' or stoops to allow of your doing so. A keeper or  beater should never be encouraged in, or allowed to 'duck' or stoop; the  practice is a bad one, and should be for ever discountenanced. If no one  fired over a ducked body the habit would soon fall into disuse.  Sportsmen and others would do well to bear in mind that an accident  deprives the injured man from earning his livelihood, and the poor wife  and children suffer: better to forego taking a shot for safety sake and  let the bird escape for another day than run any risk. This should be  made a hard-and-fast rule among sportsmen, and a law of sport.    The left hand should never be placed upon the gun till the bird has  risen and _all is clear_ ahead. Coolness in the field is everything;  there should be no blundering, no hurry; a man who knows the  capabilities of his gun can afford to be cool. He knows but too well  there is no occasion for haste; the cool hand would pause after the bird  rose, and give it time to get fairly away before presenting.    A gun should never be so wielded as to bring its barrels in line with  any one, or the barrels athwart any one. When quite a youth I remember  being in the field, when one of the party becoming fatigued from the  effects of a tight boot handed me his gun; the friend, who evidently did  not appreciate the confidence placed in the youngster, kept aloof--well  to the right; presently a bird rose, I hesitated; looking at the bird.  'Fire! Fire! why don't you fire, sir?' exclaimed the old gentleman with  some warmth. 'How can I,' cried I, 'with those peasants at work right in  front?' The effect was marvellous. The old gentleman, thoroughly  appreciating the caution, at once joined me, and I had the benefit of my  full share of the sport.    Firing when in thick cover and from behind hedges should be conducted  with caution, and with a knowledge that all is clear on the other side.    Little observation will show whether your companion has been accustomed  to the use of firearms. A man of reckless temperament, one who would  blaze away blindly, a devil-may-care sort of fellow, should be avoided;  give him a very wide berth, and keep the gentleman well on your extreme  left. If you can shunt him altogether so much the better. A gun should  never be carried in the field at the trail; should never be carried  under the arm, hugging the lock; should never be carried muzzle down, so  that by an accidental slip, or stumble, or fall, the barrels may become  choked with earth (which would burst the muzzle if not removed before  firing); should never be carried transversely across the body with  barrels pointing left. When shooting, a man should be as much upon his  etiquette as he would be in my lady's drawing-room; should mind his P's  and Q's, and remember that when in a china-shop he should refrain from  carrying his umbrella under his arm.    As a fact, the closing of one eye in taking aim is unnecessary. The  complete angle of sight upon a given object can only be obtained by the  use of both eyes. Consequently two objects cannot be seen distinctly or  clearly at the same instant, one is clear while the others are blurred  or misty; hence it stands to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33333"],[0,"The Statute of Anne (#2)"],[1,"upon, or Sell or Expose to Sale, any  Book or Books at such a Price or Rate as shall be Conceived by any  Person or Persons to be High and Unreasonable; It shall and may be  Lawful for any Person or Persons to make Complaint thereof to the Lord  Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being; the Lord Chancellor, or  Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Great Britain for the time being; the  Lord Bishop of London for the time being; the Lord Chief Justice of the  Court of Queen's Bench, the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common  Pleas, the Lord Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer, for the time  being; the Vice Chancellors of the Two Universities for the time being,  in that part of Great Britain called England; the Lord President of the  Sessions for the time being; the Lord Justice General for the time  being; the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer for the time being; the  Rector of the College of Edinburgh for the time being, in that part of  Great Britain called Scotland; who, or any one of them, shall and have  hereby full Power and Authority from time to time, to Send for, Summon,  or Call before him or them such Bookseller or Booksellers, Printer or  Printers, and to Examine and Enquire of the reason of the Dearness and  Inhauncement of the Price or Value of such Book or Books by him or them  so Sold or Exposed to Sale; and if upon such Enquiry and Examination it  shall be found, that the Price of such Book or Books is Inhaunced, or    Page 4    any wise too High or Unreasonable, Then and in such case, the said  Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, Bishop of  London, two Chief Justices, Chief Baron, Vice Chancellors of the  Universities, in that part of Great Britain called England, and the said  Lord President of the Sessions, Lord Justice General, Lord Chief Baron,  and Rector of the College of Edinburgh, in that part of Great Britain  called Scotland, or any one or more of them, so Enquiring and Examining,  have hereby full Power and Authority to Reform and Redress the same, and  to Limit and Settle the Price of every such Printed Book and Books, from  time to time, according to the best of their Judgements, and as to them  shall seem Just and Reasonable; and in case of Alteration of the Rate or  Price from what was Set or Demanded by such Bookseller or Booksellers,  Printer or Printers, to Award and Order such Bookseller and Booksellers,  Printer and Printers, to Pay all the Costs and Charges that the Person  or Persons so Complaining shall be put unto, by reason of such  Complaint, and of the causing such Rate or Price to be so Limited and  Settled; all which shall be done by the said Archbishop of Canterbury,  Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, Bishop of London, two Chief Justices,  Chief Baron, Vice-Chancellors of the Two Universities, in that part of  Great Britain called England, and the said Lord President of the  Sessions, Lord Justice General, Lord Chief Baron, and Rector of the  College of Edinburgh, in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, or  any one of them, by Writing under their Hands and Seals, and thereof  Publick Notice shall be forthwith given by the said Bookseller or  Booksellers, Printer or Printers, by an Advertisement in the Gazette;  and if any Bookseller or Booksellers, Printer or Printers, shall, after  such Settlement made of the said Rate and Price, Sell, or expose to Sale  any Book or Books, at a higher or greater Price than what shall have  been so Limited and Settled, as aforesaid, then and in every such case  such Bookseller and Booksellers, Printer and Printers, shall Forfeit the  Sum of Five Pounds for every such Book so by him, her, or them Sold or  Exposed to Sale; One Moiety thereof to the Queen's most Excellent  Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety to any Person or  Persons that shall Sue for the same, to be Recovered, with Costs of  Suit, in any of Her Majesty's Courts of Record at Westminster, by Action  of Debt, Bill, Plaint or Information, in which no Wager of Law, Essoign,  Privilege or Protection, or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.
