[Illustration: The Standard Filiere.]    It is necessary, in giving or following directions for knitting, to  caution knitters to observe a medium in their work--not knitting either  too loose or too tight.          Siberian Cuffs.      Nine shades of German wool, used double, will be required.--No. 8  needles.    Cast on sixty-four stitches with the darkest shade;--knit three plain  rows.    _Fourth row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together.    Repeat these four rows, (which form the pattern), nine times,--taking a  lighter shade of wool each time.          A Knitted Silk Cuff.      Coarse black netting silk.--Four needles, No. 22. Cast on twenty-eight  stitches on each of three needles:--knit two plain rounds.    _Third round_--bring the silk forward, slip one; knit one; pass the  slipped stitch over it; knit one; pearl one.    Repeat the third round, until the cuff be of the depth required;  then,--knit two plain rounds to correspond with the commencement.          Open Stitch for Cuffs.      With coarse silk.--Four needles, No. 22.    Cast on any even number of stitches, on each of three needles.    _First round_--knit two together.    _Second round_--bring the silk forward, knit one.    _Third round_--plain knitting.    Repeat from the first round.          Very Pretty Cuffs.      Two colours are generally used--say red and white. They are prettiest in  four-thread embroidery fleecy, or German wool.--Two needles No. 16, and  two No. 20, will be required.        Cast on forty-six stitches.                }      Bring the wool forward, knit two together. } white.

Pearl one row.                             }    Repeat these two red and white stripes, alternately, four times, and  finish with the two stitches together, as at the commencement.    The cuffs, when finished, roll over at the top.          Muffatees with two Colours.      German wool,--three needles, No. 25. The prettiest colours are cerise  and brown;--commencing with the brown. Cast on eighty-eight stitches,  viz.--thirty on each of two needles, and twenty-eight on the  third.--Knit four rounds,--two stitches of each alternately pearl and  plain.    Knit one plain round.    Pearl three rounds.    The above is all with one colour,--the brown.    Take off two stitches without knitting; knit six with the  cerise.--Repeat, alternately, to the end of the round.    The next nine rounds are the same.    Knit one plain round with the brown.    Pearl three rounds.    Commence again with the cerise,--knitting four stitches only at the  beginning of the round;--then take off two stitches, and knit six,  alternately, as before.    These cuffs may be worked to any desired length, finishing off the same  as at the commencement.          Gentlemen's Muffatees.      Cast on fifty-four stitches, in double German wool.--No. 14 needles.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two  together.--Repeat.    Every row is the same,--the first and last stitches being plain. When  finished they are to be sewn up.          Plain Ribbed Muffatees.      Four needles will be required.    Cast on each of three needles, eighteen or twenty-four stitches,  according to the size desired.    _First round_--knit three; pearl three;--alternately.    _Second and succeeding rounds_--repeat the first.          Another Pair of Muffatees.      Three-thread fleecy, or Zephyr wool.--No. 13 needles.    Cast on thirty-six stitches.    Knit twenty plain stitches, and sixteen in double knitting.    When they are sufficiently large, knit or sew them up. The double  knitting comes over the hand, the plain knitting setting tight to the  wrist.          Knitted Cuffs, Shell Pattern.      These may be made either with silk, cotton, or fine wool.--Needles No.  22.    Cast thirty stitches on each of two needles, and forty on a third;--knit  one plain round.    _Second round_--pearl one; pass the silk back, knit one; pearl one;  bring the silk forward, knit one, by which you make a loop  stitch;--repeat this five times, which, with the loop stitch, will make  thirteen from the last pearled stitch. Commence the pattern again, as at  beginning of round.    _Third round_--pearl one; knit one; pearl one; slip one; knit one, pass  the slip-stitch over it; knit nine; knit two together.--Repeat to the  end of the round.    _Fourth round_--same as third, except that there will be only seven  plain stitches to knit.    _Fifth round_--same as third, with only five plain stitches.    There will now be the same number of stitches on the needles as at the  commencement, viz.--seven for the shell part of the pattern, and three  for the division.    Knit one plain round, except on the three division stitches, which are  to be knitted as before.    Commence again as at second round. When the cuffs are of sufficient  length, knit a plain round to correspond with the beginning.    The prettiest way of knitting these cuffs will be to work the first  pattern in cerise;--the next five in white; the next five, alternately  in cerise and white; then five in white; and finish with one in cerise.          Double Knitted Cuffs.      These cuffs are prettiest in single German wool; two colours are  required,--say claret and white. They will take sixteen skeins of white  wool and eight of claret--No. 13 needles.    Cast on forty-six stitches in claret,--pearl four rows. Pearl one row  white; in the next--bring the wool forward, knit two together:--repeat  these two rows of white, twice,--making altogether six rows. The four  rows of claret in pearl knitting, and the six rows of white, are now to  be repeated, alternately, until six stripes of each are worked. Then,--    Pick up seventy stitches in claret, on the right side, at one of the  narrow ends, and pearl one row. Repeat the six rows of white,--finishing  with the four rows of claret, and cast off.    Repeat the same at the other end of the cuff,--observing that the  knitting of the frill is to be on the wrong side.    Sew up the cuffs, and double them, so as to allow the frill, at the one  end, to appear above that at the other.          A Brioche[A].      The _Brioche_ knitting-stitch is simply--bring the wool forward, slip  one; knit two together.    A Brioche is formed of sixteen straight narrow stripes, and sixteen wide  stripes, the latter gradually decreasing in width towards the top or  centre of the cushion. It may be made in three-thread fleecy, or double  German wool, with ivory or wooden pins, No. 8.    Cast on ninety stitches, in black, for the narrow stripe; knit two  turns;--then, three turns in gold colour, and two turns again in black.  This completes the narrow stripe.    The conical stripe is knitted as follows:--bring the wool forward, knit  two together, twice, and turn; knit these two, and two more of the black  and turn; continue this,--taking each time two more stitches of the  black, until within two stitches of the top, and turn; the wool will now  be at the bottom or wide part of the stripe. Commence again with the  black, as in the former narrow stripe, knitting the two black stitches  at the top. It may be also as well to diminish the narrow stripes by  turning when within two stitches of the top, in the centre row of gold  colour.    By a _turn_ is meant one row and back again.    The colours for the conical stripes may be any two or four colours,  which assort well together; or each may be different. When the last  conical stripe is finished, it is to be knitted to the first narrow  stripe.--The brioche is to be made up with a stiff bottom of mill board,  about eight inches in diameter, covered with cloth. The top is drawn  together, and fastened in the centre with a tuft of soft wool, or a cord  and tassels. It should be stuffed with down or fine combed wool.       [A] So called from its resemblance, in shape, to the well known     French cake of that name.          Fringe Pattern Knitting.      Cast on any even number of stitches, in German wool--No. 10 needles.    Turn the wool round the needle, bringing it in front again; knit two  together, taken in front.    Every row is the same.          An Opera Cap.      No. 10 needles--Double German wool, or three-thread fleecy.    Cast on eighty stitches,--white.        Pearl one row, } white.      Knit one row,  }    Pearl one row,--coloured. In the next row,--    Bring the wool before the needle, and knit two stitches together.        Pearl one row, } white.      Knit one row,  }        Pearl one row, } white.      Knit one row,  }    The above forms the border.      _First division_--coloured.    Pearl one row.    Knit one row, decreasing one stitch at each end.    Knit one row.    Knit a fancy row, by bringing the wool forward, and knitting two  stitches together.      _Second_--white.    Pearl one row, decreasing one stitch at each end.

I  let fall therefore upon the Perpendicular CP the Sine of Incidence AD;  and if the reflected Ray be desired, I produce AD to B so that DB be  equal to AD, and draw CB. For this Line CB shall be the reflected Ray;  the Angle of Reflexion BCP and its Sine BD being equal to the Angle and  Sine of Incidence, as they ought to be by the second Axiom, But if the  refracted Ray be desired, I produce AD to H, so that DH may be to AD as  the Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is, (if the Light  be red) as 3 to 4; and about the Center C and in the Plane ACP with the  Radius CA describing a Circle ABE, I draw a parallel to the  Perpendicular CPQ, the Line HE cutting the Circumference in E, and  joining CE, this Line CE shall be the Line of the refracted Ray. For if  EF be let fall perpendicularly on the Line PQ, this Line EF shall be the  Sine of Refraction of the Ray CE, the Angle of Refraction being ECQ; and  this Sine EF is equal to DH, and consequently in Proportion to the Sine  of Incidence AD as 3 to 4.    In like manner, if there be a Prism of Glass (that is, a Glass bounded  with two Equal and Parallel Triangular ends, and three plain and well  polished Sides, which meet in three Parallel Lines running from the  three Angles of one end to the three Angles of the other end) and if the  Refraction of the Light in passing cross this Prism be desired: Let ACB  [in _Fig._ 2.] represent a Plane cutting this Prism transversly to its  three Parallel lines or edges there where the Light passeth through it,  and let DE be the Ray incident upon the first side of the Prism AC where  the Light goes into the Glass; and by putting the Proportion of the Sine  of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11 find EF the first  refracted Ray. Then taking this Ray for the Incident Ray upon the second  side of the Glass BC where the Light goes out, find the next refracted  Ray FG by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of  Refraction as 11 to 17. For if the Sine of Incidence out of Air into  Glass be to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11, the Sine of Incidence  out of Glass into Air must on the contrary be to the Sine of Refraction  as 11 to 17, by the third Axiom.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Much after the same manner, if ACBD [in _Fig._ 3.] represent a Glass  spherically convex on both sides (usually called a _Lens_, such as is a  Burning-glass, or Spectacle-glass, or an Object-glass of a Telescope)  and it be required to know how Light falling upon it from any lucid  point Q shall be refracted, let QM represent a Ray falling upon any  point M of its first spherical Surface ACB, and by erecting a  Perpendicular to the Glass at the point M, find the first refracted Ray  MN by the Proportion of the Sines 17 to 11. Let that Ray in going out of  the Glass be incident upon N, and then find the second refracted Ray  N_q_ by the Proportion of the Sines 11 to 17. And after the same manner  may the Refraction be found when the Lens is convex on one side and  plane or concave on the other, or concave on both sides.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]      AX. VI.    _Homogeneal Rays which flow from several Points of any Object, and fall  perpendicularly or almost perpendicularly on any reflecting or  refracting Plane or spherical Surface, shall afterwards diverge from so  many other Points, or be parallel to so many other Lines, or converge to  so many other Points, either accurately or without any sensible Error.  And the same thing will happen, if the Rays be reflected or refracted  successively by two or three or more Plane or Spherical Surfaces._    The Point from which Rays diverge or to which they converge may be  called their _Focus_. And the Focus of the incident Rays being given,  that of the reflected or refracted ones may be found by finding the  Refraction of any two Rays, as above; or more readily thus.    _Cas._ 1. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 4.] be a reflecting or refracting Plane,  and Q the Focus of the incident Rays, and Q_q_C a Perpendicular to that  Plane. And if this Perpendicular be produced to _q_, so that _q_C be  equal to QC, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of the reflected Rays: Or  if _q_C be taken on the same side of the Plane with QC, and in  proportion to QC as the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction, the  Point _q_ shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    _Cas._ 2. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 5.] be the reflecting Surface of any Sphere  whose Centre is E. Bisect any Radius thereof, (suppose EC) in T, and if  in that Radius on the same side the Point T you take the Points Q and  _q_, so that TQ, TE, and T_q_, be continual Proportionals, and the Point  Q be the Focus of the incident Rays, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of  the reflected ones.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    _Cas._ 3. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 6.] be the refracting Surface of any Sphere  whose Centre is E. In any Radius thereof EC produced both ways take ET  and C_t_ equal to one another and severally in such Proportion to that  Radius as the lesser of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction hath to  the difference of those Sines. And then if in the same Line you find any  two Points Q and _q_, so that TQ be to ET as E_t_ to _tq_, taking _tq_  the contrary way from _t_ which TQ lieth from T, and if the Point Q be  the Focus of any incident Rays, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of the  refracted ones.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    And by the same means the Focus of the Rays after two or more Reflexions  or Refractions may be found.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    _Cas._ 4. Let ACBD [in _Fig._ 7.] be any refracting Lens, spherically  Convex or Concave or Plane on either side, and let CD be its Axis (that  is, the Line which cuts both its Surfaces perpendicularly, and passes  through the Centres of the Spheres,) and in this Axis produced let F and  _f_ be the Foci of the refracted Rays found as above, when the incident  Rays on both sides the Lens are parallel to the same Axis; and upon the  Diameter F_f_ bisected in E, describe a Circle. Suppose now that any  Point Q be the Focus of any incident Rays. Draw QE cutting the said  Circle in T and _t_, and therein take _tq_ in such proportion to _t_E as  _t_E or TE hath to TQ. Let _tq_ lie the contrary way from _t_ which TQ  doth from T, and _q_ shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays without  any sensible Error, provided the Point Q be not so remote from the Axis,  nor the Lens so broad as to make any of the Rays fall too obliquely on  the refracting Surfaces.[A]    And by the like Operations may the reflecting or refracting Surfaces be  found when the two Foci are given, and thereby a Lens be formed, which  shall make the Rays flow towards or from what Place you please.[B]    So then the Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane  or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence flow from or  towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction flow from  or towards the Point _q_ found by the foregoing Rules. And if the  incident Rays flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or  refracted Rays shall flow from or towards so many other Points _q_  found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays flow  from or towards the Point _q_ is easily known by the situation of that  Point. For if that Point be on the same side of the reflecting or  refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays flow  from the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point _q_ and the  refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the  reflected flow from _q_, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary  happens when _q_ is on the other side of the Surface.      AX. VII.    _Wherever the Rays which come from all the Points of any Object meet  again in so many Points after they have been made to converge by  Reflection or Refraction, there they will make a Picture of the Object  upon any white Body on which they fall._    So if PR [in _Fig._ 3.] represent any Object without Doors, and AB be a  Lens placed at a hole in the Window-shut of a dark Chamber, whereby the  Rays that come from any Point Q of that Object are made to converge and  meet again in the Point _q_; and if a Sheet of white Paper be held at  _q_ for the Light there to fall upon it, the Picture of that Object PR  will appear upon the Paper in its proper shape and Colours. For as the  Light which comes from the Point Q goes to the Point _q_, so the Light  which comes from other Points P and R of the Object, will go to so many  other correspondent Points _p_ and _r_ (as is manifest by the sixth  Axiom;) so that every Point of the Object shall illuminate a  correspondent Point of the Picture, and thereby make a Picture like the  Object in Shape and Colour, this only excepted, that the Picture shall  be inverted. And this is the Reason of that vulgar Experiment of casting  the Species of Objects from abroad upon a Wall or Sheet of white Paper  in a dark Room.    In like manner, when a Man views any Object PQR, [in _Fig._ 8.] the  Light which comes from the several Points of the Object is so refracted  by the transparent skins and humours of the Eye, (that is, by the  outward coat EFG, called the _Tunica Cornea_, and by the crystalline  humour AB which is beyond the Pupil _mk_) as to converge and meet again  in so many Points in the bottom of the Eye, and there to paint the  Picture of the Object upon that skin (called the _Tunica Retina_) with  which the bottom of the Eye is covered. For Anatomists, when they have  taken off from the bottom of the Eye that outward and most thick Coat  called the _Dura Mater_, can then see through the thinner Coats, the  Pictures of Objects lively painted thereon. And these Pictures,  propagated by Motion along the Fibres of the Optick Nerves into the  Brain, are the cause of Vision. For accordingly as these Pictures are  perfect or"]]]
