Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light  about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful  roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.  The power of  thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had  fallen into the stream.  There was no additional strangulation; the  noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water  from his lungs.  To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea  seemed to him ludicrous.  He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw  above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!  He was  still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a  mere glimmer.  Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he  was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now  very comfortable.  \"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought, \"that is  not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.  No; I will not be shot;  that is not fair.\"    He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist  apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.  He gave the  struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a  juggler, without interest in the outcome.  What splendid effort!--what  magnificent, what superhuman strength!  Ah, that was a fine endeavor!  Bravo!  The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the  hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.  He watched them  with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the  noose at his neck.  They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside,  its undulations resembling those of a water snake.  \"Put it back, put  it back!\"  He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the  undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had  yet experienced.  His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his  heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to  force itself out at his mouth.  His whole body was racked and wrenched  with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed  to the command.  They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward  strokes, forcing him to the surface.  He felt his head emerge; his  eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively,  and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great  draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!    He was now in full possession of his physical senses.  They were,  indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.  Something in the awful  disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that  they made record of things never before perceived.  He felt the  ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck.  He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual  trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--he saw the very  insects upon them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray  spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.  He noted the  prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass.  The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream,  the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water  spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made  audible music.  A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the  rush of its body parting the water.    He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the  visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,  and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the  captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.  They were  in silhouette against the blue sky.  They shouted and gesticulated,  pointing at him.  The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;  the others were unarmed.  Their movements were grotesque and horrible,  their forms gigantic.    Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water  smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with  spray.  He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with  his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the  muzzle.  The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge  gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.  He observed that  it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were  keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one  had missed.    A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was  again looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort.  The sound  of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind  him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and  subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.  Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread  significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the  lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning's work.  How  coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging,  and enforcing tranquility in the men--with what accurately measured  interval fell those cruel words:    \"Company! . . . Attention! . . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready!. . .  Aim! . . . Fire!\"    Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could.  The water roared in his  ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the  volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of  metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.  Some of  them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing  their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was  uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.    As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been  a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream--nearer  to safety.  The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal  ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from  the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets.  The  two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.    The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming  vigorously with the current.  His brain was as energetic as his arms  and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:    \"The officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet's error a  second time.  It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot.  He  has probably already given the command to fire at will.  God help me,  I cannot dodge them all!\"    An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,  rushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air  to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to  its deeps!  A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon  him, blinded him, strangled him!  The cannon had taken an hand in the  game.  As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten  water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and  in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest  beyond.    \"They will not do that again,\" he thought; \"the next time they will  use a charge of grape.  I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke  will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the  missile.  That is a good gun.\"    Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top.  The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and  men, all were commingled and blurred.  Objects were represented by  their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all  he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a  velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick.  In few  moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of  the stream--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which  concealed him from his enemies.  The sudden arrest of his motion, the  abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept  with delight.  He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself  in handfuls and audibly blessed it.  It looked like diamonds, rubies,  emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not  resemble.  The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted  a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their  blooms.  A strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their  trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of AEolian harps.  He had not wish to perfect his escape--he was content to remain in  that enchanting spot until retaken.    A whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his  head roused him from his dream.  The baffled cannoneer had fired him a  random farewell.  He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank,  and plunged into the forest.    All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.  The  forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not  even a woodman's road.  He had not known that he lived in so wild a  region.  There was something uncanny in the revelation.    By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished.  The thought of his  wife and children urged him on.  At last he found a road which led him  in what he knew to be the right direction.  It was as wide and  straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled.  No fields  bordered it, no dwelling anywhere.  Not so much as the barking of a  dog suggested human habitation.  The black bodies of the trees formed  a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point,  like a diagram in a lesson in perspective.

To such a task the critic may lend himself without arousing  our antagonism.  We have no pressing need to know the latent  possibilities of emotion for us in a book or a poem; but whether  it is excellent or the reverse, whether \"we were right in being  moved by it,\" we are indeed willing to hear, for we desire to  justify the faith that is in us.    If, then, the office of the judge be an essential part of the  critical function, the appreciative critic, whatever his other  merits,--and we shall examine them later,--fails at least of  perfection.  His scheme is not the ideal one; and we may turn  back, in our search for it, to a closer view of those which  his was to supersede.  Impressionism, however, is at once out  of the running; it has always vigorously repudiated the notion  of the standard, and we know, therefore, that no more than  appreciation can it choose its material and stand alone.  But  scientific criticism professes, at least, the true faith  M.  Brunetiere holds that his own method is the only one by which  an impersonal and stable judgment can be rendered.    The doctrine of the evolution of literary species is more or  less explained in naming it.  Literary species, M. Brunetiere  maintains, do exist.  They develop and are transformed into  others in a way more or less analogous to the evolution of  natural types.  It remains to see on what basis an objective  judgment can be given.  Although M. Brunetiere seems to make  classification the disposal of a work in the hierarchy of  species, and judgment the disposal of it in relation to others  of its own species, he has never sharply distinguished between  them; so that we shall not be wrong in taking his three  principles of classification, scientific, moral, and aesthetic,  as three principles by which he estimates the excellence of a  work.  His own examples, indeed, prove that to him a thing is  already judged in being classified.  The work of art is judged,  then, by its relation to the type.  Is this position tenable?  I hold that, on the contrary, it precludes the possibility of  a critical judgment; for the judgment of anything always means  judgment with reference to the end for which is exists.  A bad  king is not the less a bad king for being a good father; and  if his kingship is his essential function, he must be judged  with reference to that alone.  Now a piece of literature is,  with reference to its end, first of all a work of art.  It  represents life and it enjoins morality, but it is only as a  work of art that it attains consideration; that, in the words  of M. Lemaitre, it \"exists\" for us at all.  Its aim is beauty,  and beauty is its excuse for being.    The type belongs to natural history.  The one principle at the  basis of scientific criticism is, as we have seen, the  conception of literary history as a process, and of the work  of art as a product.  The work of art is, then, a moment in a  necessary succession, governed by laws of change and adaptation  like those of natural evolution.  But how can the conception of  values enter here?  Excellence can be attributed only to that  which attains an ideal end; and a necessary succession has no  end in itself.  The \"type,\" in this sense, is perfectly hollow.  To say that the modern chrysanthemum is better than that of  our forbears because it is more chrysanthemum-like is true only  if we make the latter form the arbitrary standard of the  chrysanthemum.  If the horse of the Eocene age is inferior to  the horse of to-day, it is because, on M. Brunetiere's principle,  he is less horse-like.  But who shall decide which is more like  a horse, the original or the latter development?  No species  which is constituted by its own history can be said to have  an end in itself, and can, therefore, have an excellence to  which it shall attain.  In short, good and bad can be applied  to the moments in a necessary evolution only by imputing a  fictitious superiority to the last term; and so one type cannot  logically be preferred to another.  As for the individual  specimens, since the conception of the type does not admit the  principle of excellence, conformity thereto means nothing.    The work of art, on the other hand, as a thing of beauty, is  an attainment of an ideal, not a product, and, from this point  of view, is related not at all to the other terms of a succession,  its causes and its effects, but only to the abstract principles  of that beauty at which it aims.  Strangely enough, the whole  principle of this contention has been admitted by M. Brunetiere  in a casual sentence, of which he does not appear to recognize  the full significance.  \"We acknowledge, of course,\" he says,  \"that there is in criticism a certain difference from natural  history, since we cannot eliminate the subjective element if  the capacity works of art have of producing impressions on us  makes a part of their definition.  It is not in order to be  eaten that the tree produces its fruit.\"  But this is giving  away his whole position!  As little as the conformity of the  fruit to its species has to do with our pleasure in eating it,  just so little has the conformity of a literary work to its  genre to do with the quality by virtue of which it is defined  as art.    The Greek temple is a product of Greek religion applied to  geographical conditions.  To comprehend it as a type, we must  know that it was an adaptation of the open hilltop to the  purpose of the worship of images of the gods.  But the most  penetrating study of the slow moulding of this type will never  reveal how and why just those proportions were chosen which  make the joy and the despair of all beholders.  Early Italian  art was purely ecclesiastical in its origin.  The exigencies  of adaptation to altars, convent walls, or cathedral domes  explain the choice of subjects, the composition, even perhaps  the color schemes (as of frescoes, for instance); and yet all  that makes a Giotto greater than a Pictor Ignotus is quite  unaccounted for by these considerations.    The quality of beauty is not evolved.  All that comes under  the category of material and practical purpose, of idea or of  moral attitude, belongs to the succession, the evolution, the  type  But the defining characters of the work of art are  independent of time.  The temple, the fresco, and the symphony,  in the moment they become objects of the critical judgment,  become also qualities of beauty and transparent examples of  its laws.    If the true critical judgment, then, belongs to an order of  ideas of which natural science can take no cognizance, the  self-styled scientific criticism must show the strange paradox  of ignoring the very qualities by virtue of which a given work  has any value, or can come at all to be the object of aesthetic  judgment.  In two words, the world of beauty and the world of  natural processes are incommensurable, and scientific criticism  of literary art is a logical impossibility.    But the citadel of scientific criticism has yet one more  stronghold.  Granted that beauty, as an abstract quality, is  timeless; granted that, in the judgment of a piece of literary  art, the standard of value is the canon of beauty, not the  type; yet the old order changeth.  Primitive and civilized man,  the Hottentot and the Laplander, the Oriental and the Slav,  have desired differing beauties.  May it, then, still be said  that although a given embodiment of beauty is to be judged  with reference to the idea of beauty alone, yet the concrete  ideal of beauty must wear the manacles of space and time,--  that the metamorphoses of taste preclude the notion of an  objective beauty?  And if this is true, are we not thrown  back again on questions of genesis and development, and a  study of the evolution, not of particular types of art, but  of general aesthetic feeling; and, in consequence, upon a  form of criticism which is scientific in the sense of being  based on succession, and not on absolute value?    It is indeed true that the very possibility of a criticism  which shall judge of aesthetic excellence must stand or fall  with this other question of a beauty in itself, as an objective  foundation for criticism.  If there is an absolute beauty, it  must be possible to work out a system of principles which shall  embody its laws,--an aesthetic, in other words; and on the basis  of that aesthetic to deliver a well-founded critical judgment.  Is there, then, a beauty in itself?  And if so, in what does  it consist?    We can approach such an aesthetic canon in two ways: from the  standpoint of philosophy, which develops the idea of beauty as  a factor in the system of our absolute values, side by side  with the ideas of truth and of morality, or from the standpoint  of empirical science.  For our present purpose, we may confine  ourselves to the empirical facts of psychology and physiology.    When I feel the rhythm of poetry, or of perfect prose, which  is, of course, in its own way, no less rhythmical, every  sensation of sound sends through me a diffusive wave of nervous  energy.  I am the rhythm because I imitate it in myself.  I  march to noble music in all my veins, even though I may be  sitting decorously by my own hearthstone; and when I sweep with  my eyes the outlines of a great picture, the curve of a Greek  vase, the arches of a cathedral, every line is lived over again  in my own frame.  And when rhythm and melody and forms and  colors give me pleasure, it is because the imitating impulses  and movements that have arisen in me are such as suit, help,  heighten my physical organization in general and in particular.  It may seem somewhat trivial to say that a curved line is  pleasing because the eye is so hung as to move best in it;  but we may take it as one instance of the numberless conditions  for healthy action which a beautiful form fulfills.
