[Illustration: No. 15                           JOSEPH HAYDN.]    Well, Franz Schubert also lived for a time with the Esterhazy family. He  was piano teacher to the children of Count Johann. Franz was then  twenty-one years old.    In what year was he twenty-one?    A good friend of Schubert's was Michael Vogl. He was a famous singer,  who did all he could to make Schubert's songs known.    They took little vacation trips together and were good companions. When  you read more about this singer's friendship for Franz Schubert you will  like him for being so kind to one who had very little pleasure in life.    He looks like a good friend even in a picture--do you not think so?                             [Illustration: No. 16                  SCHUBERT ACCOMPANYING VOGL AS HE SINGS.]    Once when Schubert and Vogl were enjoying a vacation tour in the  mountains, Franz read Scott's _Lady of the Lake_, which was printed in  the year 1810, when Schubert was thirteen years old.    Schubert set some of this poem to music. A fact you will remember when  you read it in school.    Perhaps you could remember at the same time that Scott was a little  older than Schubert and just one year younger than Beethoven.    Beethoven lived in Vienna at that time and Schubert with two friends  went to see him. Beethoven was very deaf, and those who met him had to  write down what they wanted to say with a large pencil, such as is used  by carpenters. Schubert was so modest and nervous upon meeting the great  master that he could not even write his replies.    Here is the picture of the way Beethoven looked as he walked down the  street in those days:                             [Illustration: No. 17                           BEETHOVEN IN VIENNA.]    Once when Schubert was very ill a friend sent him some books to read.  They were _The Last of the Mohicans_, _The Spy_, _The Pilot_, and _The  Pioneer_.    Now these books were written by the American author, whose name you must  find for yourself.                             [Illustration: No. 18                           SCHUBERT'S WORK ROOM.]    See what a simple work room Schubert had. Here are his Clavier and chair  and a few books.    Schubert had music in his mind and soul all the time. It is said that  one of his favorite walks was down by a mill, where he was inspired to  write some beautiful songs.                             [Illustration: No. 19                    SCHUBERT BY THE MILL IN THE WOODS.]    This is the way that Franz Schubert wrote his name.

He  composed a great deal of music which slowly made friends for him. Robert  Schumann was one who spoke kindly of the young Norwegian and his music.  And so he grew and improved. Because he was true to his talent, he made  many friends not only in Leipzig but throughout Europe, as we shall see.                       [Illustration: No. 11 R. SCHUMANN]    You will learn some day the names of many of the people who became  friends of Grieg. There were Rikard Nordraak, and later on Franz Liszt.  Grieg became one of the group of great Norwegian artists in which  Henrik Ibsen and Bjornstjerne Bjornson were prominent. Indeed, Grieg  wrote the music to Ibsen's _Peer Gynt_. One of the great pleasures of  Grieg's life was Bjornson's _Patriotic Poem_ to his own music.                        [Illustration: No. 12 NORDRAAK]                          [Illustration: No. 13 LISZT]                          [Illustration: No. 14 IBSEN]                        [Illustration: No. 15 BJORNSON]    One day Grieg showed Gade a composition called _In Autumn_ which Gade  did not like. \"It is too Norwegian,\" he said. This pleased Grieg,  although Gade told him to go home and write something better. He was  nearly as rough as Grieg's schoolmaster.    But one day later a prize was offered in Sweden for an orchestral  composition. Grieg's _In Autumn_ won the prize. And Gade was one of the  judges. We wonder if he forgot about it!                          [Illustration: No. 16 GADE]    Grieg married his cousin Mina Hagerup, to whom he dedicated his famous  song: _I Love Thee_. But the mother of his bride did not think highly of  him.    \"He is a nobody,\" she said, \"who writes music that no one cares to  listen to.\"                   [Illustration: No. 17 GRIEG AND HIS WIFE]    But people were beginning to listen. After a concert in Christiania,  entirely of Norwegian music, the Government gave Grieg a small pension  and he went to Rome.    Here he had a fine meeting with Liszt who asked Grieg to play. Then  Liszt took Grieg's manuscript and played it at sight, to his great  delight.    When Grieg bade good-bye to Liszt the famous pianist said to him:    \"Keep on, you have talent and ability. Do not let any one discourage or  frighten you.\"    So sensitive was Grieg about music writing that he never allowed any one  to watch him. So he had a little house built in the mountains where he  could work at his leisure. This he called his \"tune house.\" There was  only one room and it was for all the world like a little play house  that children have. In it was his piano and often when he was playing,  the Norwegian peasants used to group themselves outside the door,  sometimes joining in the singing, and then again dancing to their  delightful folktunes and dances.                       [Illustration: No. 18 TUNE HOUSE]    Here are some pictures of Grieg as he looked in later years.                  [Illustration: No. 19 GRIEG IN LATER YEARS]                  [Illustration: No. 20 GRIEG IN LATER YEARS]    As a boy in Leipzig he worked too hard and sickness made it necessary  for him to return home. From this sickness he never fully recovered. All  his life he was frail and unable to endure severe tasks.    In appearance Grieg was short and rather bent in figure. His hands were  thin, but fine and strong for the piano, although one of them had been  crushed in an accident. His eyes were deep blue. They looked straight at  you and were full of life and kindness.    Grieg was merry of nature; a lovely companion, full of fun and company.  Sometimes, however, he was sad and melancholy like his own music.         [Illustration: No. 21 GRIEG  PERCY GRAINGER  MRS. GRIEG  RONTGEN]    Some day you will learn the names of many of his compositions. And among  them you will love such pieces as _The Birds_, _In Spring Time_,  _Arietta_, the _Peer Gynt Music_, the _Piano Sonata_, the _Piano and  Violin Sonata_, and lots of lively Norwegian dances and tunes. Indeed,  he has composed many compositions which you will number among your  favorite pieces.    Three great names stand out more than all others in the musical history  of Scandinavia. You have learned two, Edvard Grieg and Ole Bull. The  other is Jenny Lind, known as \"the Swedish nightingale,\" who was loved  not only for her wonderful voice but for her kindness and noble nature.  She was born at Stockholm in 1820 and died in England in 1887. In Sweden  to this day Jennie Lind is a great national personage. The people look  upon her as we would on Washington, Irving, Lincoln or Longfellow. She  was very beautiful.    Here is her picture.
