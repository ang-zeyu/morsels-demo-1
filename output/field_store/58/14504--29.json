[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#2)"],[1," you  got up early; it's barely five o'clock yet.\"    If I was astonished with my sight of the river banks, I was no less  astonished at my waterman, now that I had time to look at him and see him  with my head and eyes clear.    He was a handsome young fellow, with a peculiarly pleasant and friendly  look about his eyes,--an expression which was quite new to me then,  though I soon became familiar with it.  For the rest, he was dark-haired  and berry-brown of skin, well-knit and strong, and obviously used to  exercising his muscles, but with nothing rough or coarse about him, and  clean as might be.  His dress was not like any modern work-a-day clothes  I had seen, but would have served very well as a costume for a picture of  fourteenth century life: it was of dark blue cloth, simple enough, but of  fine web, and without a stain on it.  He had a brown leather belt round  his waist, and I noticed that its clasp was of damascened steel  beautifully wrought.  In short, he seemed to be like some specially manly  and refined young gentleman, playing waterman for a spree, and I  concluded that this was the case.    I felt that I must make some conversation; so I pointed to the Surrey  bank, where I noticed some light plank stages running down the foreshore,  with windlasses at the landward end of them, and said, \"What are they  doing with those things here?  If we were on the Tay, I should have said  that they were for drawing the salmon nets; but here--\"    \"Well,\" said he, smiling, \"of course that is what they _are_ for.  Where  there are salmon, there are likely to be salmon-nets, Tay or Thames; but  of course they are not always in use; we don't want salmon _every_ day of  the season.\"    I was going to say, \"But is this the Thames?\" but held my peace in my  wonder, and turned my bewildered eyes eastward to look at the bridge  again, and thence to the shores of the London river; and surely there was  enough to astonish me.  For though there was a bridge across the stream  and houses on its banks, how all was changed from last night!  The soap-  works with their smoke-vomiting chimneys were gone; the engineer's works  gone; the lead-works gone; and no sound of rivetting and hammering came  down the west wind from Thorneycroft's.  Then the bridge!  I had perhaps  dreamed of such a bridge, but never seen such an one out of an  illuminated manuscript; for not even the Ponte Vecchio at Florence came  anywhere near it.  It was of stone arches, splendidly solid, and as  graceful as they were strong; high enough also to let ordinary river  traffic through easily.  Over the parapet showed quaint and fanciful  little buildings, which I supposed to be booths or shops, beset with  painted and gilded vanes and spirelets.  The stone was a little  weathered, but showed no marks of the grimy sootiness which I was used to  on every London building more than a year old.  In short, to me a wonder  of a bridge.    The sculler noted my eager astonished look, and said, as if in answer to  my thoughts--    \"Yes, it _is_ a pretty bridge, isn't it?  Even the up-stream bridges,  which are so much smaller, are scarcely daintier, and the down-stream  ones are scarcely more dignified and stately.\"    I found myself saying, almost against my will, \"How old is it?\"    \"Oh, not very old,\" he said; \"it was built or at least opened, in 2003.  There used to be a rather plain timber bridge before then.\"    The date shut my mouth as if a key had been turned in a padlock fixed to  my lips; for I saw that something inexplicable had happened, and that if  I said much, I should be mixed up in a game of cross questions and  crooked answers.  So I tried to look unconcerned, and to glance in a  matter-of-course way at the banks of the river, though this is what I saw  up to the bridge and a little beyond; say as far as the site of the soap-  works.  Both shores had a line of very pretty houses, low and not large,  standing back a little way from the river; they were mostly built of red  brick and roofed with tiles, and looked, above all, comfortable, and as  if they were, so to say, alive, and sympathetic with the life of the  dwellers in them.  There was a continuous garden in front of them, going  down to the water's edge, in which the flowers were now blooming  luxuriantly, and sending delicious waves of summer scent over the eddying  stream.  Behind the houses, I could see great trees rising, mostly  planes, and looking down the water there were the reaches towards Putney  almost as if they were a lake with a forest shore, so thick were the big  trees; and I said aloud, but as if to myself--    \"Well, I'm glad that they have not built over Barn Elms.\"    I blushed for my fatuity as the words slipped out of my mouth, and my  companion looked at me with a half smile which I thought I understood; so  to hide my confusion I said, \"Please take me ashore now: I want to get my  breakfast.\"    He nodded, and brought her head round with a sharp stroke, and in a trice  we were at the landing-stage again.  He jumped out and I followed him;  and of course I was not surprised to see him wait, as if for the  inevitable after-piece that follows the doing of a service to a fellow-  citizen.  So I put my hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and said, \"How  much?\" though still with the uncomfortable feeling that perhaps I was  offering money to a gentleman.    He looked puzzled, and said, \"How much?  I don't quite understand what  you are asking about.  Do you mean the tide?  If so, it is close on the  turn now.\"    I blushed, and said, stammering, \"Please don't take it amiss if I ask  you; I mean no offence: but what ought I to pay you?  You see I am a  stranger, and don't know your customs--or your coins.\"    And therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as one does in  a foreign country.  And by the way, I saw that the silver had oxydised,  and was like a blackleaded stove in colour.    He still seemed puzzled, but not at all offended; and he looked at the  coins with some curiosity.  I thought, Well after all, he _is_ a  waterman, and is considering what he may venture to take.  He seems such  a nice fellow that I'm sure I don't grudge him a little over-payment.  I  wonder, by the way, whether I couldn't hire him as a guide for a day or  two, since he is so intelligent.    Therewith my new friend said thoughtfully:    \"I think I know what you mean.  You think that I have done you a service;  so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to  a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me.  I have heard  of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a  troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it.  And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my  _business_, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection  with it would look very queer.  Besides, if one person gave me something,  then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me  rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos  of friendship.\"    And he laughed loud and merrily, as if the idea of being paid for his  work was a very funny joke.  I confess I began to be afraid that the man  was mad, though he looked sane enough; and I was rather glad to think  that I was a good swimmer, since we were so close to a deep swift stream.  However, he went on by no means like a madman:    \"As to your coins, they are curious, but not very old; they seem to be  all of the reign of Victoria; you might give them to some  scantily-furnished museum.  Ours has enough of such coins, besides a fair  number of earlier ones, many of which are beautiful, whereas these  nineteenth century ones are so beastly ugly, ain't they?  We have a piece  of Edward III., with the king in a ship, and little leopards and fleurs-  de-lys all along the gunwale, so delicately worked.  You see,\" he said,  with something of a smirk, \"I am fond of working in gold and fine metals;  this buckle here is an early piece of mine.\"    No doubt I looked a little shy of him under the influence of that doubt  as to his sanity.  So he broke off short, and said in a kind voice:    \"But I see that I am boring you, and I ask your pardon.  For, not to  mince matters, I can tell that you _are_ a stranger, and must come from a  place very unlike England.  But also it is clear that it won't do to  overdose you with information about this place, and that you had best  suck it in little by little.  Further, I should take it as very kind in  you if you would allow me to be the showman of our new world to you,  since you have stumbled on me first.  Though indeed it will be a mere  kindness on your part, for almost anybody would make as good a guide, and  many much better.\"    There certainly seemed no flavour in him of Colney Hatch; and besides I  thought I could easily shake him off if it turned out that he really was  mad; so I said:    \"It is a very kind offer, but it is difficult for me to accept it,  unless--\"  I was going to say, Unless you will let me pay you properly;  but fearing to stir up Colney Hatch again, I changed the sentence into,  \"I fear I shall be taking you away from your work--or your amusement.\"    \"O,\" he said, \"don't trouble about that, because it will give me an  opportunity of doing a good turn to a friend of mine, who wants to take  my work here.  He is a weaver from Yorkshire, who has rather overdone  himself between his weaving and his mathematics, both indoor work, you  see; and being a great friend of mine, he naturally came to me to get him  some outdoor work.  If you think you can put up with me, pray take me as  your guide.\"    He added presently: \"It is true that I have promised to go up-stream to  some special friends of mine, for the hay-harvest; but they won't be  ready for us for more than a week: and besides, you might go with me, you  know, and see some very nice "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],[0,"A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#2)"],[1,"of _H.  bistincta_, _charadricola_, and _robertsorum_ and X-rays of the other  species shows no notable specific differences in the osteology.

Adult male having a snout-vent length of  43.2 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 51.1 per cent of snout-vent length;  foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle  to tip of longest toe), 20.8 mm.; greatest width of head, 15.4 mm.,  35.6 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 13.9 mm., 32.1 per  cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 5.1 mm.; diameter of  tympanum, 2.4 mm., 47.1 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout in lateral  profile bluntly rounded, in dorsal profile truncate; canthus  pronounced, rounded, not angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips  thick, round, not flaring; nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial  distance, 3.4 mm.; interorbital distance, 4.5 mm., somewhat broader  than width of eyelid, 3.5 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior  corner of eye above tympanum and curved downward to insertion of  forearm; tympanum round, its diameter slightly more than its distance  from eye. Forearm not robust; row of small pustules on ventral surface  of forearm; fold on wrist; prepollex moderately enlarged, covered with  small, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row of  spines on inner surface of second finger; subarticular tubercles  large, round, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles rather large, round;  palmar tubercles rather small, flat, elliptical; fingers long,  moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest,  1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger slightly larger  than tympanum; rudimentary web between first and second and between  second and third fingers; web between third and fourth fingers  extending about one-fourth length of fourth finger. Heels overlap by  about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal  articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold strong,  extending to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle large, high, and  elongate; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; subarticular tubercles  moderately large, round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single rows  on proximal segments of digits; toes moderately short; length of toes  from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth toes about equal  in length; toes about two-thirds webbed; web extending to middle of  antepenultimate phalanx of fourth toe, to discs of first, second, and  fifth toes, and to base of penultimate phalanx of third toe; discs  rather small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening  at level of lower edge of thighs; anal sheath elongate, deeply creased  medially; transverse dermal fold above anus. Skin of dorsal surfaces  of head, body, and limbs faintly areolate; skin of chin, belly, and  ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that of ventral surfaces of  limbs, except thighs, areolate; thoracic fold absent. Tongue nearly  round, slightly longer than wide, shallowly notched behind and barely  free posteriorly. Vomerine teeth 4-4, situated on rounded vomerine  ridges between rather small ovoid inner nares; vocal slits present,  situated along posterior edge of each ramus.    Color (in alcohol) pale brown on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and  limbs; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs creamy white with dark  brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with creamy  white spots; belly cream-color; anal stripe absent.    Color (in life) pale tan on dorsal surfaces; flanks and anterior  surfaces of thighs pale creamy yellow with purplish brown  reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with yellow spots;  ventral surfaces yellow; iris pale copper-color.    _Variation._--There is little variation in structure. The total number  of vomerine teeth varies from 6 to 14. In some individuals the  supratympanic fold covers the upper part of the tympanum, but at least  the lower part of the tympanum is always visible. The extent of the  webbing between the toes varies from three-fourths to two-thirds  complete. Usually the web extends to some point on the antepenultimate  phalanx of the fourth toe, but in some specimens the web extends to  the base of the penultimate phalanx.    In the large series of specimens from Uruapan, Michoacan, the  coloration of the flanks and anterior surfaces of the thighs varies  from nearly uniform creamy yellow with only fine dark reticulations to  bold reticulations enclosing yellow spots. Some specimens from Oaxaca  and Veracruz have slightly different markings on the flanks; in these  the dark pigment is in the form of irregular spots or dashes, instead  of reticulations.    There is considerable variation in color in the living frogs. The  dorsum varies from greenish tan and pale yellowish tan to reddish  brown, and some individuals are dark chocolate brown.    _Remarks._--Shannon (1951:470) named _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ on  the basis of a single male from San Lucas Camotlan, Oaxaca; he  diagnosed the subspecies as differing from"]]]
