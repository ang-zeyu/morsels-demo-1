INTRODUCTORY--BIRTH AND ANCESTRY.    The leading spirits whom the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered about him in  his brief but glorious career, were remarkable men. Not remarkable for  illustrious birth, for they were of humble origin; not for scholarly  attainments, for such were the conditions of their early life that  scholastic education of a very high order was out of the question: but  they were remarkable for character--that mysterious something which  exists independent of birth, education or fortune.    It has become proverbial that all great movements, all reformations,  all revolutions must produce their own leaders; and this is as true of  the great work of the last days, the establishment of the Church of  Christ on the earth, as it is of any other great movement. Leaders in  established usages and institutions, political, social or religious,  are very seldom converted to innovations. They usually consider it to  their interest to oppose changes, especially those changes which from  their very nature cast any shadow of doubt upon the correctness of  existing customs or institutions with which they are connected. Hence  it happened that the Jewish rabbis, the priests, the scribes, the  members of the great Sanhedrin--leaders in their nation--did not accept  the doctrines of Messiah and become the chief apostles, seventies  and elders of the new church. On the contrary, this class were the  stubbornest opponents to the doctrines taught by the Son of God, and  His most implacable enemies. It was the common people who heard Him  gladly: and from their number He chose the apostles, who, through the  God-given powers of the priesthood conferred upon them, shook the old  systems of morals and religion from their foundations.    Nor can it be doubted that the hand of the Lord is in this matter of  choosing men to be His messengers, His prophets and His rulers. Many  of them are chosen before they are born in the flesh. The messenger  that was to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of God, John the  Baptist, was so chosen. Jeremiah was ordained a prophet to the nations  before he was born. Cyrus the Great, the war prince of Persia, was  selected to be the deliverer of Israel from Babylonian bondage more  than a century before his birth. Indeed, we are given to understand  from the revelations of God, that from among the nobler class of  spirits that dwell in His presence, the Father hath chosen those who  are to be His rulers.    From the very nature of things it must be necessary that men whose  minds are unwarped by prevailing customs and traditions, should be  selected to establish a new order of religion, of government or of  society. How could the Jewish priests and rabbis, bound by long custom  to a slavish adherence to the outward forms and ceremonies of the  Mosaic ritual, the spirit and purpose of which had long been made of no  effect by the rubbish of false traditions, open their minds to receive  the larger and nobler doctrines of the gospel of Christ, unmixed with  the pomp and circumstance which they of that age and nation considered  essential to religion?    Can men educated to an attachment for despotic government, and whose  interests are bound up with its maintenance, be expected to look with  favor on democratic principles, or become the champions of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#2)"],[1,"to send photographs by wire. What I'm aiming at is to make an  apparatus so that when you go into a telephone booth to talk to a  friend, you can see him and he can see you, on a specially  prepared plate that will be attached to the telephone.\"    \"You mean see him as in a looking-glass, Tom?\"    \"Somewhat, yes. Though I shall probably use a metal plate instead  of glass. It will be just as if you were talking over a telephone  in an open field, where you could see the other party and he could  see you.\"    \"But how are you going to do it, Tom?\"    \"Well, I haven't quite decided. I shall probably have to use the  metal called selenium, which is very sensitive to light, and which  makes a good or a poor electrical conductor according as more or  less light falls on it. After all, a photograph is only lights and  shadows, fixed on sensitive paper or films.\"    \"Well, Tom, maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't. I admit  you've used some good arguments,\" said Mr. Swift. \"But then, it  all comes down to this: What good will it be if you can succeed in  sending a picture over a telephone wire?\"    \"What good, Dad? Why, lots of good. Just think how important it  will be in business, if you can make sure that you are talking to  the party you think you are. As it is now, unless you know the  person's voice, you can't tell that the man on the other end of  the wire is the person he says he is. And even a voice can be  imitated.\"    \"But if you know the person yourself, he can't be imitated. If you  see him, as well as hear his voice, you are sure of what you are  doing. Why, think of the big business deals that could be made  over the telephone if the two parties could not only hear but see  each other. It would be a dead sure thing then. And Mr. Brown  wouldn't have to take Mr. Smith's word that it was he who was  talking. He could even get witnesses to look at the wire-image if  he wanted to, and so clinch the thing. It will prevent a lot of  frauds.\"    \"Well, Tom, maybe you're right. Go ahead. I'll say no more against  your plans. I wish you all success, and if I can help you, call on  me.\"    \"Thanks, Dad. I knew you'd feel that way when you understood. Now  I'm going--\"    But what Tom Swift was going to do he did not say just then, for  above the heads of father and son sounded a rattling, crashing  noise, and the whole house seemed to shake. Then the voice of  Eradicate was heard yelling:    \"Good land! Good land ob massy! Come out yeah, Massa Tom! Come  right out yeah! Dere's a man on de roof an' he am all tangled up  suthin' scandalous! Come right out yeah befo' he falls and  translocates his neck! Come on!\"            CHAPTER II    BAD NEWS      With startled glances at each other, Tom and his father rushed  from the library to the side of the house, whence came the cries  of Eradicate.    \"What is it, Rad! what is it?\" questioned Tom.    \"Is someone hurt?\" Mr. Swift wanted to know.    \"He mighty soon will be!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"Look where  he am holdin' on! Lucky fo' him he grabbed dat chimbley!\"    Tom and his father looked to where Eradicate pointed, and saw a  strange sight. A small biplane-airship had become entangled in  some of the aerials of Tom's wireless apparatus, and the craft had  turned turtle, being held from falling by some of the wire braces.    The birdman had fallen out, but had managed to cling to the  chimney, so that he had not reached the ground, and there he  clung, while the motor of his airship was banging away, and  revolving the propeller blades dangerously close to his head.    \"Are you hurt?\" cried Tom, to the unknown birdman.    \"No, but I'm likely to be unless I get out of here!\" was the  gasped-out answer.    \"Hold fast!\" cried Tom. \"We'll have you down in a jiffy. Here,  Rad, you get the long ladder. Where's Koku? That giant is never  around when he's wanted. Find Koku, Rad, and send him here.\"    \"Yas, sah, Massa Tom; directly, sah!\" and the colored man hastened  off as fast as his aged legs would take him.    And while preparations are thus under way to rescue the birdman  from the roof, I will take just a few minutes to tell you a little  something more about Tom Swift and his numerous inventions, as set  forth in the previous books of this series.    \"Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle\" was the first book, and in that I  related how Tom made the acquaintance of a Mr. Wakefield Damon, of  the neighboring town of Waterford, and how Tom bought that  gentleman's motor cycle, after it had tried to climb a tree with  its rider in the saddle. Mr. Wakefield Damon was an odd man, whose  favorite expression was \"Bless my shoelaces!\" or something equally  absurd. Waterford was not far from Shopton, where Tom and his  father made their home.    Mr. Swift was also an inventor of note, and Tom soon followed in  his father's footsteps. They lived in a large house, with many  shops about it, for their work at times required much machinery.    Mrs. Baggert was the housekeeper who looked after Tom and his  father, and got their meals, when they consented to take enough  time from their inventive work to eat. Another member of the  household was Eradicate Sampson, a genial old colored man, who  said he was named Eradicate because he used to eradicate the dirt  about the place.    Koku, just referred to by Tom, was an immense man, a veritable  giant, whom Tom had brought back with him from one of his trips,  after escaping from captivity. The young inventor really brought  two giants, brothers they were, but one had gone to a museum, and  the other took service with our hero, making himself very useful  when it came to lifting heavy machinery.    Tom had a close friend in Ned Newton, who was employed in the  Shopton bank. Another friend was Miss Mary Nestor, a young lady  whose life Tom had once saved. He had many other friends, and some  enemies, whom you will meet from time to time in this story.    After Tom had had many adventures on his motor cycle he acquired a  motor boat, and in that he and Ned went through some strenuous  times on Lake Carlopa, near Tom's home. Then followed an airship,  for Tom got that craze, and in the book concerning that machine I  related some of the things that happened to him. He had even more  wonderful adventures in his submarine, and with his electric  runabout our hero was instrumental in saving a bank from ruin by  making a trip in the speediest car on the road.    After Tom Swift had sent his wireless message, and saved the  castaways of Earthquake Island, he thought he would give up his  inventive work for a time, and settle down to a life of ease and  quiet.    But the call of the spirit of adventure was still too strong for  him to resist. That was why he sought out the diamond makers, and  learned the secret of Phantom Mountain. And when he went to the  Caves of Ice, and there saw his airship wrecked, Tom was well-nigh  discouraged, But he managed to get back to civilization, and later  undertook a journey to elephant land, with his powerful electric  rifle.    Marvelous adventures underground did Tom Swift have when he went  to the City of Gold, and I have set down some of them in the book  bearing the latter title. Later on he sought the platinum treasure  in his air glider. And when Tom was taken captive, in giant land,  only his speedy airship saved him from a hard fate.    By this time moving pictures were beginning to occupy a large  place in the scientific, as well as the amusement world, and Tom  invented a Wizard Camera which did excellent work. Then came the  need of a powerful light, to enable Uncle Sam's custom officers on  the border to detect the smugglers, and Tom was successful in  making his apparatus.    He thought he would take a rest after that, but with the opening  of the Panama Canal came the need of powerful guns to protect that  important waterway, and Tom made a Giant Cannon, which enabled the  longest shots on record to be fired.    Now, some months had passed, after the successful trial of the big  weapon, and Tom longed for new activities. He found them in the  idea of a photo telephone, and he and his father were just talking  of this when interrupted by the accident to the birdman on the  roof of the Swift home.    \"Have you got that ladder, Rad?\" cried the young inventor,  anxiously, as he saw the dangerous position of the man from the  airship.    \"Yas, sah, Massa Tom! I'se a-camin' wif it!\"    \"And where's Koku? We'll need him!\"    \"He's a-camin', too!\"    \"Here Koku!\" exclaimed a deep voice, and a big man came running  around the corner of the house. \"What is it, Master?\"    \"We must get him down, Koku!\" said Tom, simply. \"I will go up on  the roof. You had better come, too. Rad, go in the house and get a  mattress from the bed. Put it down on the ground where he's likely  to fall. Lively now!\"    \"Yas, sah, Massa Tom!\"    \"Me git my own ladder--dat one not strong 'nuff!\" grunted Koku,  who did not speak very good English. He had a very strong ladder,  of his own make, built to hold his enormous bulk, and this he soon  brought and placed against the side of the house.    Meanwhile Tom and his father had raised the one Eradicate had  brought, though Tom did most of the lifting, for his father was  elderly, and had once suffered from heart trouble.    \"We're coming for you!\" cried the young inventor as he began to  ascend the ladder, at the same time observing that the giant was  coming with his. \"Can you hold on a little longer?\"    \"Yes, I guess so. But I dare not move for fear the propellers will  strike me.\"    \"I see. I'll soon shut off the motor,\" said Tom. \"What happened,  anyhow?\"    \"Well, I was flying over your house. I was on my way to pay you a  visit, but I didn't intend to do it in just this way,\" and the  birdman smiled grimly. \"I didn't see your wireless aerials until I  was plumb into them, and then it was too late. I hope I haven't  damaged them any.\"    \"Oh, they are easily fixed,\""]]]
