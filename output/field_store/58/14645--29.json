But of a sudden his head went up; his stiff-poised brush broke into  swift wagging; his lips curled down. He had recognized that his  prospective foe was not of his own sex. (And nowhere, except among  humans, does a full-grown male ill-treat or even defend himself  against the female of his species.)    Lady, noting the stranger's sudden friendliness, paused irresolute in  her charge. And at that instant Lad darted past her. Full at Knave's  throat he launched himself.    The Master rasped out:    \"Down, Lad! _Down!_\"    Almost in midair the collie arrested his onset--coming to earth  bristling, furious and yet with no thought but to obey. Knave, seeing  his foe was not going to fight, turned once more toward Lady.    \"Lad,\" ordered the Master, pointing toward Knave and speaking with  quiet intentness, \"let him alone. Understand? Let him _alone_.\"    And Lad understood--even as years of training and centuries of  ancestry had taught him to understand every spoken wish of the  Master's. He must give up his impulse to make war on this intruder  whom at sight he hated. It was the Law; and from the Law there was no  appeal.    With yearningly helpless rage he looked on while the newcomer was  installed on The Place. With a wondering sorrow he found himself  forced to share the Master's and Mistress' caresses with this  interloper. With growing pain he submitted to Knave's gay attentions  to Lady, and to Lady's evident relish of the guest's companionship.  Gone were the peaceful old days of utter contentment.    Lady had always regarded Lad as her own special property--to tease and  to boss and to despoil of choice food-bits. But her attitude toward  Knave was far different. She coquetted, human-fashion, with the  gold-and-black dog--at one moment affecting to scorn him, at another  meeting his advances with a delighted friendliness.    She never presumed to boss him as she had always bossed Lad. He  fascinated her. Without seeming to follow him about, she was forever  at his heels. Lad, cut to the heart at her sudden indifference toward  his loyal self, tried in every way his simple soul could devise to win  back her interest. He essayed clumsily to romp with her as the  lithely graceful Knave romped, to drive rabbits for her on their  woodland rambles, to thrust himself, in a dozen gentle ways, upon her  attention.    But it was no use. Lady scarcely noticed him. When his overtures of  friendship chanced to annoy her, she rewarded them with a snap or with  an impatient growl. And ever she turned to the all-conquering Knave in  a keenness of attraction that was all but hypnotic.    As his divinity's total loss of interest in himself grew too apparent  to be doubted, Lad's big heart broke. Being only a dog and a  Grail-knight in thought, he did not realize that Knave's newness and  his difference from anything she had known, formed a large part of  Lady's desire for the visitor's favor; nor did he understand that such  interest must wane when the novelty should wear off.    All Lad knew was that he loved her, and that for the sake of a flashy  stranger she was snubbing him.    As the Law forbade him to avenge himself in true dog-fashion by  fighting for his Lady's love, Lad sadly withdrew from the unequal  contest, too proud to compete for a fickle sweetheart. No longer did  he try to join in the others' lawn-romps, but lay at a distance, his  splendid head between his snowy little forepaws, his brown eyes sick  with sorrow, watching their gambols.    Nor did he thrust his undesired presence on them during their woodland  rambles. He took to moping, solitary, infinitely miserable. Perhaps  there is on earth something unhappier than a bitterly aggrieved  dog. But no one has ever discovered that elusive something.    Knave from the first had shown and felt for Lad a scornful indifference.  Not understanding the Law, he had set down the older collie's  refusal to fight as a sign of exemplary, if timorous prudence, and he  looked down upon him accordingly. One day Knave came home from the  morning run through the forest without Lady. Neither the Master's  calls nor the ear-ripping blasts of his dog-whistle could bring her  back to The Place. Whereat Lad arose heavily from his favorite  resting-place under the living-room piano and cantered off to the  woods. Nor did he return.    Several hours later the Master went to the woods to investigate,  followed by the rollicking Knave. At the forest edge the Master  shouted. A far-off bark from Lad answered. And the Master made his way  through shoulder-deep underbrush in the direction of the sound.    In a clearing he found Lady, her left forepaw caught in the steel jaws  of a fox-trap. Lad was standing protectingly above her, stooping now  and then to lick her cruelly pinched foot or to whine consolation to  her; then snarling in fierce hate at a score of crows that flapped  hopefully in the tree-tops above the victim.    The Master set Lady free, and Knave frisked forward right joyously to  greet his released inamorata. But Lady was in no condition to  play--then nor for many a day thereafter. Her forefoot was so  lacerated and swollen that she was fain to hobble awkwardly on three  legs for the next fortnight.    It was on one pantingly hot August morning, a little later, that Lady  limped into the house in search of a cool spot where she might lie and  lick her throbbing forefoot. Lad was lying, as usual, under the piano  in the living-room. His tail thumped shy welcome on the hardwood floor  as she passed, but she would not stay or so much as notice him.    On she limped, into the Master's study, where an open window sent a  faint breeze through the house. Giving the stuffed eagle a wide berth,  Lady hobbled to the window and made as though to lie down just beneath  it. As she did so, two things happened: she leaned too much weight on  the sore foot, and the pressure wrung from her an involuntary yelp of  pain; at the same moment a crosscurrent of air from the other side of  the house swept through the living-room and blew shut the door of the  adjoining study. Lady was a prisoner.    Ordinarily this would have caused her no ill-ease, for the open window  was only thirty inches above the floor, and the drop to the veranda  outside was a bare three feet. It would have been the simplest matter  in the world for her to jump out, had she wearied of her chance  captivity.    But to undertake the jump with the prospect of landing her full weight  and impetus on a forepaw that was horribly sensitive to the lightest  touch--this was an exploit beyond the sufferer's will-power. So Lady  resigned herself to imprisonment. She curled herself up on the floor  as far as possible from the eagle, moaned softly and lay still.    At sound of her first yelp, Lad had run forward, whining eager  sympathy. But the closed door blocked his way. He crouched, wretched  and anxious, before it, helpless to go to his loved one's assistance.    Knave, too, loping back from a solitary prowl of the woods, seeking  Lady, heard the yelp. His prick-ears located the sound at once. Along  the veranda he trotted, to the open study window. With a bound he had  cleared the sill and alighted inside the room.    It chanced to be his first visit to the study. The door was usually  kept shut, that drafts might not blow the Master's desk-papers  about. And Knave felt, at best, little interest in exploring the  interior of houses. He was an outdoor dog, by choice.    He advanced now toward Lady, his tail a-wag, his head on one side,  with his most irresistible air. Then, as he came forward into the  room, he saw the eagle. He halted in wonder at sight of the enormous  white-crested bird with its six-foot sweep of pinion. It was a wholly  novel spectacle to Knave; and he greeted it with a gruff bark, half of  fear, half of bravado. Quickly, however, his sense of smell told him  this wide-winged apparition was no living thing. And ashamed of his  momentary cowardice, he went over to investigate it.    As he went, Knave cast over his shoulder a look of invitation to Lady  to join him in his inspection. She understood the invitation, but  memory of that puppyhood beating made her recoil from accepting  it. Knave saw her shrink back, and he realized with a thrill that she  was actually afraid of this lifeless thing which could harm no  one. With due pride in showing off his own heroism before her, and  with the scamp-dog's innate craving to destroy, he sprang growling  upon the eagle.    Down tumbled the papier-mache stump. Down crashed the huge stuffed  bird with it; Knave's white teeth buried deep in the soft feathers of  its breast.    Lady, horror-struck at this sacrilege, whimpered in terror. But her  plaint served only to increase Knave's zest for destruction.    He hurled the bird to the floor, pinned it down with his feet and at  one jerk tore the right wing from the body. Coughing out the mouthful  of dusty pinions, he dug his teeth into the eagle's throat. Again  bracing himself with his forelegs on the carcass, he gave a sharp  tug. Head and neck came away in his mouth. And then before he could  drop the mouthful and return to the work of demolition, he heard the  Master's step.    All at once, now, Knave proved he was less ignorant of the Law--or, at  least, of its penalties--than might have been supposed from his act of  vandalism. In sudden panic he bolted for the window, the silvery head  of the eagle still, unheeded, between his jaws. With a vaulting  spring, he shot out through the open casement, in his reckless  eagerness to escape, knocking against Lady's injured leg as he passed.    He did not pause at Lady's scream of pain, nor did he stop until he  reached the chicken-house. Crawling under this, he deposited the  incriminating eagle-head in the dark recess. Finding no pursuer, he  emerged and jogged innocently back toward the veranda.

LETTER I           BASRAH, ASIATIC TURKEY, _Jan. 1, 1890_.    A _shamal_ or N.W. wind following on the sirocco which had accompanied  us up \"the Gulf\" was lashing the shallow waters of the roadstead into  reddish yeast as we let go the anchor opposite the sea front of  Bushire, the most important seaport in Persia. _The_ Persian  man-of-war _Persepolis_, officered by Germans, H.M. ship _Sphinx_, two  big steamers owned in London, a British-built three-masted clipper,  owned and navigated by Arabs, and a few Arab native vessels tugged at  their anchors between two and three miles from the shore. Native  _buggalows_ clustered and bumped round the trading vessels, hanging on  with difficulty, or thumped and smashed through the short waves, close  on the wind, easily handled and sailing magnificently, while the  Residency steam-launch, puffing and toiling, was scarcely holding her  own against a heavy head sea.    Bushire, though it has a number of two-storied houses and a population  of 15,000, has a most insignificant appearance, and lies so low that  from the _Assyria's_ deck it gave the impression of being below the  sea-level. The _shamal_ was raising a sand storm in the desert beyond;  the sand was drifting over it in yellow clouds, the mountains which at  a greater or less distance give a wild sublimity to the eastern shores  of the Gulf were blotted out, and a blurred and windy shore  harmonised with a blurred and windy sea.    The steam-launch, which after several baffled attempts succeeded in  reaching the steamer's side, brought letters of welcome from Colonel  Ross, who for eighteen years has filled the office of British Resident  in the Persian Gulf with so much ability, judgment, and tact as to  have earned the respect and cordial esteem of Persians, Arabs, the  mixed races, and Europeans alike. Of his kindness and hospitality  there is no occasion to write, for every stranger who visits the Gulf  has large experience of both.    The little launch, though going shorewards with the wind, was tossed  about like a cork, shipping deluges of spray, and it was so cold and  generally tumultuous, that it was a relief to exchange the shallow,  wind-lashed waters of the roadstead for the shelter of a projecting  sea-wall below the governor's house. A curricle, with two fiery little  Arab horses, took us over the low windy stretch of road which lies  behind Bushire, through a part of the town and round again to the  sea-shore, on which long yellow surges were breaking thunderously in  drifts of creamy foam. The Residency, a large Persian house, with that  sort of semi-fortified look which the larger Eastern houses are apt to  have, is built round courtyards, and has a fine entrance, which was  lined with well-set-up men of a Bombay marine battalion. As is usual  in Persia and Turkey, the reception rooms, living rooms, and guest  rooms are upstairs, opening on balconies, the lower part being  occupied by the servants and as domestic offices. Good fires were a  welcome adjunct to the genial hospitality of Colonel Ross and his  family, for the mercury, which for the previous week had ranged from  84 deg. to 93 deg., since the sunrise of that day had dropped to 45 deg., and the  cold, damp wind suggested an English February. Even the Residency,  thick as its walls are, was invaded by sea sand, and penetrated by  the howlings and shriekings of the _shamal_ and the low hiss at  intervals of wind-blown spray.    This miserable roadstead does a large trade,[2] though every bale and  chest destined for the cities of the interior must be packed on mules'  backs for carriage over the horrible and perilous _kotals_ or rock  ladders of the intervening mountain ranges. The chief caravan route in  Persia starts from Bushire _via_ Shiraz, Isfahan, Kashan, and Kum, to  Tihran. A loaded mule takes from thirty to thirty-five days to  Isfahan, and from Isfahan to Tihran from twelve to sixteen days,  according to the state of the roads.    Bushire does not differ in appearance from an ordinary eastern town.  Irregular and uncleanly alleys, dead mud walls, with here and there a  low doorway, bazars in which the requirements of caravans are largely  considered, and in which most of the manufactured goods are English, a  great variety in male attire, some small mosques, a marked  predominance of the Arab physiognomy and costume, and ceaseless  strings of asses bringing skins of water from wells a mile from the  town, are my impressions of the first Persian city that I have ever  seen. The Persian element, however, except in officialism and the  style of building, is not strong, the population being chiefly  composed of \"Gulf Arabs.\" There are nearly fifty European residents,  including the telegraph staff and the representatives of firms doing a  very large business with England, the Persian Gulf Trading Company,  Messrs. Hotz and Company, Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Company, and the  British India Steam Navigation Company, which has enormously developed  the trade of the Gulf.    Bushire is the great starting-point of travellers from India who  desire \"to go home through Persia\" by Shiraz and Persepolis.  _Charvadars_ (muleteers) and the necessary outfit are obtainable, but  even the kindness of the Resident fails to overcome the standing  difficulty of obtaining a Persian servant who is both capable and  trustworthy. Having been forewarned by him not to trust to Bushire for  this indispensable article, I had brought from India a Persian of good  antecedents and character, who, desiring to return to his own country,  was willing to act as my interpreter, courier, and sole attendant.  Grave doubts of his ability to act in the two latter capacities  occurred to me before I left Karachi, grew graver on the voyage, and  were quite confirmed as we tossed about in the Residency launch, where  the \"young Persian gentleman,\" as he styled himself, sat bolt upright  with a despairing countenance, dressed in a tall hat, a beautifully  made European suit, faultless tan boots, and snowy collar and cuffs, a  man of truly refined feeling and manners, but hopelessly out of place.  I pictured him helpless among the _deshabille_ and roughnesses of a  camp, and anticipated my insurmountable reluctance to ask of him  menial service, and was glad to find that the same doubts had occurred  to himself.    I lost no time in interviewing Hadji,--a Gulf Arab, who has served  various travellers, has been ten times to Mecca, went to Windsor with  the horses presented to the Queen by the Sultan of Muscat, speaks more  or less of six languages, knows English fairly, has some  recommendations, and professes that he is \"up to\" all the requirements  of camp life. The next morning I engaged him as \"man of all work,\" and  though a big, wild-looking Arab in a rough _abba_ and a big turban,  with a long knife and a revolver in his girdle, scarcely looks like a  lady's servant, I hope he may suit me, though with these antecedents  he is more likely to be a scamp than a treasure.    The continuance of the _shamal_ prevented the steamer from unloading  in the exposed roadstead, and knocked the launch about as we rejoined  her. We called at the telegraph station at Fao, and brought off Dr.  Bruce, the head of the Church Missionary Society's Mission at Julfa,  whose long and intimate acquaintance with the country and people will  make him a great acquisition on the Tigris.    \"About sixty miles above the bar outside the Shat-el-Arab\" (the united  Tigris and Euphrates), \"forty miles above the entrance to that estuary  at Fao, and twenty miles below the Turkish port of Basrah, the present  main exit of the Karun river flows into the Shat-el-Arab from "]]]
