The purpose of the present volume is to exhibit a series of  well-authenticated anecdotes, calculated to illustrate the character  and habits of the more prominent species of the animal kingdom. The  plan of the work, of course, excludes full scientific descriptions; but  it has been thought that it may be more useful, as well as interesting,  to arrange the subjects according to the most approved system of  classification, and to indicate, briefly, the leading traits of the  several orders and genera.[1]          [1] For a more scientific account of the animal kingdom, the        reader is referred to \"A Pictorial Natural History,\" &c.,        published by James Munroe & Co., Boston.          GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM      FIRST GRAND DIVISION, VERTEBRATA, or back boned animals, having a bony  skeleton, and including four classes.    _Class_ I. MAMMALIA, or sucking animals; as, man; bats, monkeys, bears,  oxen, sheep, deer, and many other four-footed beasts; as well as seals,  walruses, whales, &c.      \"  II. AVES, birds of all kinds.      \" III. REPTILIA, or reptiles; as, lizards, frogs, serpents, toads, &c.      \"  IV. PISCES, fishes generally.      SECOND GRAND DIVISION, INVERTEBRATA, or animals without a bony spine,  or a bony skeleton, and including three classes.    _Class_ I. MOLLUSCA, embracing pulpy animals mostly enclosed in shells;  as, the nautilus, oyster, clam, cuttle-fish, &c.      \"  II. ARTICULATA, or jointed animals; as, crabs, lobsters, spiders,  insects, leeches, earthworms, &c.      \" III. RADIATA, branched or radiated animals; as, the star-fish,  tape-worm, coral insect, sea anemone, &c.          VERTEBRATA.      CLASS MAMMALIA.    The mammalia include not only man, the head of creation, but, generally,  those animals which have the most numerous and perfect faculties, the  most delicate perceptions, the most varied powers, and the highest  degrees of intelligence. All the species have a double heart; red, warm  blood; and a nervous system more fully developed than that of any other  animals. This class is divided into nine orders, under each of which we  shall notice some of the more remarkable species.          ORDER I.    BIMANA,    TWO-HANDED.      MAN.    Of this race there is one species, yet divided into many nations,  kingdoms, and tribes. These are all grouped under five races: 1. The  _Caucasian_, or white race, including the most highly civilized  nations; 2. The _Mongolian_, or yellow race, including the Tartars,  Chinese, Japanese, &c.; 3. The _Malay_, or brown race, including the  people of Malacca, and most of the Oceanic islands; 4. The _American_,  or red race, including the American Indians; and 5. The _African_, or  black race, including Negroes.    Philosophers have been a good deal puzzled for a definition of man; yet  it would seem by no means difficult to point out characteristics which  distinguish him from all other animated beings. He is not only the  acknowledged lord and master of the animal kingdom, but he is the only  being that knows God, yet the only one that worships stones, apes, and  idols; the only being that has the Bible, and the only one that makes  systematic warfare on his own species. He is the only created being  that perceives the force of moral obligation, and the only one that  makes slaves of his fellow-beings; he is the only creature that has  reason, and yet the only one that besots himself with intoxicating  drugs and drinks. Man is the only being that has tasted of the tree  of knowledge, and yet the only one that appears, in all ages and  countries, to be a _fallen being_,--one not fulfilling, here on the  earth, the purposes of his creation. Must we not, from the analogy of  the works of God, look to a future state, to find the true end of human  existence?    That we may not omit to give at least one illustrative and characteristic  anecdote, under the head of \"_homo sapiens_,\" we copy the following from  the quaint pages of Carlyle:--    \"What, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the net purport of  war? To my own knowledge, for example, there dwell and toil, in the  British village of Dumdrudge, usually, some five hundred souls. From  these, by certain 'natural enemies' of the French, there are  successively selected, during the French war, say thirty able-bodied  men. Dumdrudge, at her own expense, has suckled and nursed them; she  has, not without difficulty and sorrow, fed them up to manhood, and  even trained them to crafts--so that one can weave, another build,  another hammer, and the weakest can stand under thirty stone  avoirdupois. Nevertheless, amid much weeping and swearing, they are  selected, all dressed in red, and shipped away at the public charge  some 2000 miles, or, say, only to the south of Spain, and fed there  till wanted.    \"And now to that same spot, in the south of Spain, are thirty similar  French artisans, from a French Dumdrudge, in like manner wending; till,  at length, after infinite effort, the parties come into actual  juxtaposition, and thirty stand fronting thirty, each with a gun in his  hand. Straightway the word 'Fire' is given, and they blow the souls out  of one another; and instead of sixty brisk, useful craftsmen, the world  has sixty dead carcasses, which it must bury, and anon shed tears for.  Had these men any quarrel? Busy as the devil is, not the smallest. They  lived far enough apart, were the entirest strangers; nay, in so wide a  universe, there was indeed unconsciously, by commerce, some mutual  helpfulness between them. How then?

Washburn, at that time executive director of the Arctic Institute of  North America; Mr. R. A. Gibson, deputy commissioner of the  Administration of the Northwest Territories; and Mr. G. W. Malaher,  director of the Game and Fisheries Branch, Manitoba. For the loan of a  motion-picture camera, which secured for me some extremely gratifying  scenes of the migrant hosts on the Barrens, I am greatly indebted to Mr.  William C. Morrow. Dr. Ralph S. Palmer has kindly read, and made helpful  comments upon, a preliminary draft of the present report.    Through the courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History, the  United States National Museum, and the United States Fish and Wildlife  Service, I have been able to examine important comparative material in  their collections.    A grant from the National Science Foundation has enabled me to carry the  investigation through to completion.          MIGRATIONS      The Barren Ground Caribou is the outstanding migratory land mammal of  North America at the present day. (Some of the bats, though extensively  migratory, obviously belong in a category too distinct for comparison.)  We know as yet extremely little concerning the movements of individual  Caribou;[2] but it is fairly safe to assume that among those reaching  the southern limits of the winter range in central Manitoba or  northwestern Ontario, there must be many whose summer range is at least  500 or 600 miles to the northward. The latitudinal extent of such  wanderings is comparable with, or equivalent to, an annual round trip  between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Charleston, South Carolina.  There is perhaps less information available concerning the migrations of  the wild Reindeer of the Old World than concerning the movements of the  Barren Ground Caribou of North America (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931: 191-200).        [Footnote 2: One means of gathering information on this subject      would be to capture fawns as they swim across lakes or wide rivers      on the autumn migration, then to affix numbered metal tags to      their ears and to release them in time to rejoin their mothers.      This would simply be a modification of the leg-banding method      that has proved so highly successful in the study of bird      migration. It would also be particularly useful in studies on      age and growth.]      _Southern limits of winter range_    In years long past the winter range extended at least occasionally as  far south as Fort McMurray in Alberta and Cree Lake and the upper  Mudjatick and Foster rivers in Saskatchewan, and rather regularly to  Reindeer Lake (Preble, 1908: 137); and \"on rare occasions as far south  as Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan River\" (Buchanan, 1920: 105). At  an early date Richardson believed (1829: 243) that \"none\" of these  Caribou \"go to the southward of Churchill.\"    There are, however, records of long ago that deal with mass occurrences  of Caribou on the lower courses of the Nelson, Hayes, and Severn rivers,  emptying on the west coast of Hudson Bay. The records are very puzzling  in several respects. Most of them do not definitely differentiate the  species involved from the Barren Ground Caribou, but some of them (by  Hearne, Richardson, and Preble) indicate that it is the Woodland  Caribou. The direction of the migrations, as reported in some instances,  is just the reverse of that taken at the present time by the Barren  Ground species during its normal movements at corresponding seasons.  Finally, it is all but impossible to reconcile the numbers reported with  such knowledge as we have of the status of the Woodland Caribou at any  other period or in any other region.    Perhaps the earliest account is by Dobbs (1744: 22):    \"They [residents at Fort Bourbon-York Factory] also take great numbers  of Cariboux or Rain-Deer [sp.?]. In _March_ and _April_ they come from  the North to the South, and extend then along the River 60 Leagues; they  go again Northward in _July_ and _August_; the Roads they make in the  Snow are as well padded, and cross each other as often as the Streets in  Paris.\"    In discussing the \"Indian deer\" or Woodland Caribou in the vicinity of  Great Slave Lake, Hearne remarks (1795: 225): \"This is that species of  deer which are found so plentiful near York Fort and Severn River.\"    According to Thompson (1916: 100-101), an immense herd of \"Rein Deer\"  [sp.?], estimated at the rather preposterous figure of 3,564,000  individuals, crossed the Hayes River 20 miles above York Factory in late  May, 1792. The direction of this migration is not indicated.    Richardson writes (\"1825\": 330) of the Woodland Caribou: \"In the  beginning of September, vast numbers of this kind of deer pass near York  Factory . . . on their journey towards the north-west.\"    And again (1829: 250):    \"They cross the Nelson and Severn Rivers in immense herds in the month  of May, pass the summer on the low, marshy shores of James' Bay, and  return to the northward, and at the same time retire more inland in the  month of September. . . . I have been informed by several of the  residents at York Factory that the herds are sometimes so large as to  require several hours to cross the river in a crowded phalanx.\"    The implication is that the herds passed _southward_ in May. It should  be borne in mind that these were apparently not personal observations of  Richardson's; and in his belief that the Barren Ground species did not  go south of Churchill, he may have merely assumed that the animals in  the York Factory region were the Woodland species.    \"Near York Factory, in 1831, this propensity [Indian destructiveness]  . . . led to the indiscriminate destruction of a countless herd of  reindeer [sp.?], while crossing the broad stream of Haye's River, in the  height of summer. . . . The deer have never since visited that part of  the country in similar numbers.\" (Simpson, 1843: 76).    Referring to the York Factory region in 1837, John McLean writes  (1932 [1849]: 195). \"Not many years ago this part of the country was  periodically visited by immense herds of rein-deer; at present there is  scarcely one to be found.\"    A later account of Richardson's (1852: 290) is somewhat ambiguous as to  the species to which it refers:    \"The reindeer that visit Hudson's Bay travel southward toward James's  Bay in spring. In the year 1833, vast numbers of them were killed by the  Cree Indians at a noted pass three or four days march above York  Factory. They were on their return northward, and were crossing Hayes  River in incredible multitudes.\"    Pike writes (1917 [1892]: 50) that \"within the last three years [_i.e._,  about 1888] the [Barren Ground?] caribou have appeared in their  thousands at York Factory . . . where they have not been seen for over  thirty years.\"    Preble (1902: 41) quotes Dr. Alexander Milne as thinking, after 14  years' residence at York Factory, that the small bands of \"Woodland  Caribou,\" found between Churchill and Cape Churchill, form the \"northern  fringe of the bands which migrate to the coast in spring, the great  majority of which in their journey cross to the south of Nelson River.\"  At that time, however, Preble (1902: 42), like Richardson before him,  seems to have regarded the Churchill River as the southern limit of the  Barren Ground species, and thus he may not have considered the  possibility of the animals of Cape Churchill and the Nelson and Hayes  rivers belonging to the same species.    It is difficult to draw any sure conclusions from the confusing records  just quoted. Possibly chief reliance should be placed upon the testimony  of such high authorities as Hearne, Richardson, and Preble when they  refer to the animals as Woodland Caribou. Furthermore, none of the early  writers identify them unequivocally as the Barren Ground species. It  remains fairly evident that long ago some species of Caribou in great  numbers did actually cross these rivers in a southerly direction in the  spring, pass the summer on the coastal tundra east of York Factory, and  return northward or northwestward in late summer or autumn. Whichever  species it was, it represented a segment of the population that must  have become reduced to utterly insignificant numbers, if not entirely  extirpated, some decades ago. In any event, it does not seem very likely  that we shall ever be able to reconstruct the actual movements of the  \"incredible multitudes\" in the York Factory region of more than a  century ago.    Since the beginning of the present century, until very recent years,  there seem to have been few or no Manitoba records of _R. a. arcticus_  from any locality so far to the southeast as York Factory. In 1947,  however, Mr. G. W. Malaher, director of the Game and Fisheries Branch in  Manitoba, informed me that during the previous couple of winters the  animals had ranged southward on a broad front to the latitude of Oxford  House, where they had not been known for 40 or 45 years. It was surmised  that the recent burning of large areas north of The Pas, resulting in  the destruction of the Caribou's normal winter food of lichens, had  deflected the animals toward the southeast and had caused them to extend  their migration beyond its normal limit. The Split Lake band of Indians  (on the Nelson River) were said to have killed 4,000 Caribou during the  winter of 1946-47, and to have used half of them for dog feed.    Arthur H. Lamont, in charge of the meteorological office at Fort  Churchill, gave me information concerning Caribou that he had seen  during a plane flight from that point to Edmonton on March 18, 1947. At  midday he had sighted hundreds, in bands averaging 20 to 30 individuals,  on some little lakes, averaging a quarter of a mile in diameter, near  the southwestern end of Reindeer Lake."]]]
