The efforts of the great majority of the Western Pennsylvania  petroleum producers to obtain relief from what they deem the  oppressive acts of the Standard Oil Company and the unjust  discriminations of the United Pipe Lines, and the various railroads  traversing the oil regions, have attracted more than usual attention  to the present condition of this industry and its possible future.    We would here explain that the Standard Oil Company originated in  Cleveland, Ohio, about twelve years ago, and was incorporated under  the laws of Ohio, with a nominal capital now, we are informed, of  $3,000,000, which, however, very inadequately represents the financial  strength of its members. It is now a combination of the most  prominent refiners in the country, and has before been credited with  manipulating the transportation lines to its own special advantage.    We can recall no instance of such serious hostility between parties  whose interests are at the same time of such magnitude and so nearly  identical; nor can we see what substantial, enduring benefit would  accrue to the producers in the event of their victory in the struggle.    They charge that the Standard Oil Company has become the controlling  power to fix prices and to determine the avenues by which the oil  shall be transported eastward for home consumption and for foreign  exportation; that the railway companies have given this company lower  rates than other parties for transporting the oil; and that through  the rates given to it by the railways the value of their property is  destroyed.    The reply, in effect, is, Granting all this to be true, what does  it amount to? Neither more nor less than that the managers of the  Standard Oil Company, by combination of capital, by intelligence and  shrewdness in the management of their operations, have built up a  successful business, and that they have so extended it by the use of  all practicable appliances, and by the purchase of the property of  competitors, that they do practically control the prices of oil, both  crude and refined, and that the uncombined capital of the other oil  producers, lacking the power, the intelligence, and the business skill  which combined capital can secure, cannot compete with the Standard  Oil Company. Now, is there any great wrong or injustice in this?    When brains can command capital it is always more successful in  business matters than any amount of brains without capital or capital  without brains. This result is the natural working out of the same  principle that is everywhere to be seen--some men are successful and  others are not.    It is the essence of communism to drag down those who succeed to the  level of the unsuccessful.    If men cannot compete with others in any business they must accept the  fact, and try some other employment.    If, through superior intelligence and capital, the Standard Oil  Company can control the oil business of Pennsylvania, then, according  to the principles of common sense, it must be permitted to do so.

His machine was on an entirely new  principle, and has since gone into general use. It was intricate and  somewhat expensive, but it performed its work well. Messrs. A. T.  Stewart & Co. use them largely in their mills and hotels. Mr. Maxim  made one of six thousand burner capacity for the Grand Union Hotel,  Saratoga Springs, it being the largest gas machine ever built. It has  supplied gas of an unvarying quality for six years, and is as good as  new to-day.    To reduce the cost as far as possible, Mr. Maxim has designed a new  machine on another principle, which we herewith illustrate. Fig. 1  shows the machine in perspective, and Fig. 2 is a sectional view.  The vertical cylinder is a common gas holder of sheet brass. It is 36  inches in diameter for a thousand burner machine. The operative parts  of the machine are best shown in the sectional view, which represents  the portion of the machine called the injector. A is a steam chamber  supplied with four or more pounds of steam through the pipe, K. B is  the gasoline supply pipe, and C the air supply. D is an index valve.  The operation is as follows: Steam being in the chamber, A, the  descent of the holder opens the valve, M, and allows the steam to  [_Continued on page 4._]    [Footnote 1: This experiment should not be tried in the vicinity of  a gaslight or fire.]           *       *       *       *       *          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN    ESTABLISHED 1845           *       *       *       *       *    MUNN & CO., EDITORS AND PROPRIETORS.

The extract from the report of the judges in horology, at the Sydney  International Exhibition, with the diagrams showing the comparative  merit of the watches tested, given on other pages of the current issue  of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, cannot fail to interest our readers. There  were ten exhibitors, and the inherent and comparative merits of the  various exhibits were rated under ten heads on the basis of 100 points  \"for the highest degree of excellence.\" There were British, German,  French, Swiss, and American competitors; and while the scores of the  nine European exhibitors footed up totals ranging from 76 to 686,  their average being 389-1/3, the total of the Waltham Watch Company  was 981. In detail this remarkable score stood thus: Originality,  98; invention and discovery, 95; utility and quality of material,  95; skill in workmanship, 93; fitness for purpose intended, 100;  adaptation to public wants, 100; economy, 100; cost, 100; finish and  elegance of cases, 100; timekeeping qualities, 100. Total, 981.    The timekeeping tests were made, as the report points out, by Prof.  H. C. Russell, Astronomer Royal at the Sydney Observatory; and it is  especially noted that while the majority of the watches tested had  been made for exhibition purposes, and specially prepared for that  end, the exhibit of the American company was the ordinary and regular  product of the "]]]
