The sunshine, the bracing air, the swaying boughs of the pines and  hemlocks beckoning at the woodside, and the firm smooth footing,  irresistibly invite you forth. Your feet devour the way with crisp  bites, and you think that nothing could be more pleasant to them till  you are offered a few yards of turf, laid bare by winds and sun, and  then you realize that nothing is quite so good as the old stand-by, a  naked ground, and crave more of it, even as this is, and hunger for it  with its later garnishing of grass and flowers. The crows, too, are  drawn to these bare patches and are busy upon them, and you wonder what  they can find; spiders, perhaps, for these you may see in thawy days  crawling sluggishly over the snow, where they must have come from the  earth.    The woods are astir with more life than a month ago. The squirrels are  busy and noisy, the chickadees throng about you, sometimes singing their  sweet brief song of three notes; the nuthatches pipe their tiny trumpets  in full orchestra, and the jays are clamoring their ordinary familiar  cries with occasional notes that you do not often hear. One of these is  a soft, rapidly uttered cluck, the bird all the time dancing with his  body, but not with his feet, to his own music, which is pleasant to the  ear, especially when you remember it is a jay's music, which in the main  cannot be recommended. To-day, doubtless, he is practicing the  allurements of the mating season.    You hear the loud cackle of a logcock making the daily round of his  preserves, but you are not likely to get more than a glimpse of his  black plumage or a gleam of his blood-red crest.    By rare luck you may hear the little Acadian owl filing his invisible  saw, but you are likelier to see him and mistake him for a clot of last  year's leaves lodged midway in their fall to earth.    The forest floor, barred and netted with blue shadows of trunks and  branches, is strewn with dry twigs, evergreen leaves, shards of bark,  and shreds of tree-moss and lichen, with heaps of cone scales,--the  squirrel's kitchen middens,--the sign of a partridge's nightly roosting,  similar traces of the hare's moonlight wanderings, and perhaps a fluff  of his white fur, showing where his journeys have ended forever in a  fox's maw.    Here and there the top of a cradle knoll crops out of the snow with its  patches of green moss, sturdy upright stems and leaves and red berries  of wintergreen, as fresh as when the first snow covered them, a rusty  trail of mayflower leaves, and the flat-pressed purple lobes of  squirrelcup with a downy heart of buds full of the promise of spring.    The woods are filled with a certain subtle scent quite distinct from the  very apparent resinous and balsamic aroma of the evergreens, that eludes  description, but as a kind of freshness that tickles the nose with  longing for a more generous waft of it. You can trace it to no source,  as you can the odors of the pine and the hemlocks or the sweet fragrance  of the boiling sap, coming from the sugar-maker's camp with a pungent  mixture of wood-smoke. You are also made aware that the skunk has been  abroad, that reynard is somewhere to windward, and by an undescribed,  generally unrecognized, pungency in the air that a gray squirrel lives  in your neighborhood. Yet among all these more potent odors you still  discover this subtle exhalation, perhaps of the earth filtered upward  through the snow, perhaps the first awakening breath of all the  deciduous trees.    Warmer shines the sun and warmer blows the wind from southern seas and  southern lands. More and more the tawny earth comes in sight among  puddles of melted snow, which bring the mirrored sky and its fleecy  flocks of clouds, with treetops turned topsy-turvy, down into the bounds  of fields. The brooks are alive again and babbling noisily over their  pebbled beds, and the lake, hearing them, groans and cries for  deliverance from its prison of ice.    On the marshes you may find the ice shrunken from the shores and an  intervening strip of water where the muskrat may see the sun and the  stars again. You hear the trumpets of the wild geese and see the gray  battalion riding northward on the swift wind.    The sun and the south wind, which perhaps bears some faint breath of  stolen fragrance from far-off violet banks, tempt forth the bees, but  they find no flowers yet, not even a squirrelcup or willow catkin, and  can only make the most of the fresh sawdust by the wood-pile and the  sappy ends of maple logs.    Down from the sky, whose livery he wears and whose song he sings, comes  the heavenly carol of the bluebird; the song sparrow trills his cheery  melody; the first robin is announced to-day, and we cry, \"Lo, spring has  come.\" But to-morrow may come winter and longer waiting.          III    THE HOME FIRESIDE      Weeks ago the camp-fire shed its last glow in the deserted camp, its  last thin thread of smoke was spun out and vanished in the silent air,  and black brands and gray ashes were covered in the even whiteness of  the snow. The unscared fox prowls above them in curious exploration of  the desolate shanty, where wood-mice are domiciled and to whose sunny  side the partridge comes to bask; the woodpecker taps unbidden to enter  or departs from the always open door; and under the stars that glitter  through the net of branches the owl perches on the snowy ridge and mopes  in undisturbed solemnity.    For a time, camping-days are over for the sportsman, and continue only  for the lumberman, the trapper, and the merciless crust-hunter, who  makes his secret lair in the depths of the forest. In the chill days  and evenings that fall first in the interim between winter and summer  camping, the man who makes his outings for sport and pleasure must  content himself by his own fireside, whose constant flame burns  throughout the year.    Well may he be content when the untempered winds of March howl like a  legion of wolves at his door, snow and sleet pelt roof and pane with a  continuous volley from the lowering sky, or when the chilly silence of  the last winter nights is broken by the sharp crack of frozen trees and  timbers, as if a hidden band of riflemen were besieging the house. Well  may he be content, then, with the snug corner of his own hearthstone,  around which are gathered the good wife, the children, and his camp  companions, the dogs.    Better than the camp, is this cosy comfort in days and nights such as  these, or in those that fall within that unnamed season that lies  between winter and spring, when, if one stirs abroad, his feet have  sorry choice between saturated snow and oozy mould,--a dismal season  but for its promise of brighter days, of free streams, green trees, and  bird songs.    Better, now, this genial glow that warms one's marrow than the camp-fire  that smokes or roasts one's front while his back freezes. With what  perfect contentment one mends his tackle and cleans his gun for coming  days of sport, while the good wife reads racy records of camp-life from  Maine to California, and he listens with attention half diverted by  break or rust spot, or with amused watching of the youngsters playing at  camping out. The callow campers assail him with demands for stories, and  he goes over, for their and his own enjoyment, old experiences in camp  and field, while the dogs dream by the fire of sport past or to  come,--for none but dogs know whether dog's dreams run backward or  forward.    Long-used rod and gun suggest many a tale of past adventure as they  bring to mind recollections of days of sport such as may never come  again. The great logs in the fireplace might tell, if their flaming  tongues were given speech, of camps made long ago beneath their lusty  branches, and of such noble game as we shall never see,--moose, elk,  deer, panther, wolf, and bear, which are but spectres in the shadowy  forest of the past. But the red tongues only roar and hiss as they lick  the crackling sinews of oak and hickory, and tell nothing that ordinary  ears may catch. Yet one is apt to fall dreaming of bygone days, and then  of days that may come to be spent by pleasant summer waters and in the  woods gorgeous with the ripeness of autumn.    So one is like to dream till he awakens and finds himself left with only  the dogs for comrades, before the flameless embers, deserted even by the  shadows that erstwhile played their grotesque pranks behind him. Cover  the coals as if they were to kindle to-morrow's camp-fire, put the  yawning dogs to bed, and then to bed and further dreaming.          IV    THE CROW      The robin's impatient yelp not yet attuned to happy song, the song  sparrow's trill, the bluebird's serene melody, do not herald the coming  of spring, but attend its vanguard. These blithe musicians accompany the  soft air that bares the fields, empurples the buds, and fans the bloom  of the first squirrelcups and sets the hyla's shrill chime a-ringing.    Preceding these, while the fields are yet an unbroken whiteness and the  coping of the drifts maintain the fantastic grace of their storm-built  shapes, before a recognized waft of spring is felt or the voice of a  freed stream is heard, comes that sable pursuivant, the crow, fighting  his way against the fierce north wind, tossed alow and aloft, buffeted  to this side and that, yet staggering bravely onward, and sounding his  trumpet in the face of his raging antagonist, and far in advance of its  banners, proclaiming spring.    It is the first audible promise of the longed-for season, and it  heartens us, though there be weary days of waiting for its fulfillment,  while the bold herald is beset by storm and pinched with hunger as he  holds his outpost and gleans his scant rations in the winter-desolated  land.    He finds some friendliness in nature even now.

A week of disaster had terminated woefully. Three British Generals in  succession--Sir William Gatacre, Lord Methuen, and Sir Redvers  Buller--had advanced against strongly fortified Boer positions and  suffered repulse. The hearts of the miserable loyalists, who hung in  dire suspense on the result of British action, sank in despair--their  dismay and their grief were pitiful. Great Britain echoed their  sentiment. Disappointment was universal. General Gatacre had failed  through lack of caution and mischance; the other Generals had come to  grief owing to the circumstances which forced them willy nilly to hurry  to the assistance of beleaguered towns in the face of overwhelming  disadvantages, notably the lack of cavalry and the inefficiency of the  guns. Lord Methuen had been unable to bring home his early victories  owing to the absence of mounted men. Sir Redvers Buller had failed to  dislodge the enemy from his strong, naturally fortified positions owing  to the weakness of his artillery in comparison to that of the enemy, who  had Nordenfeldt and Hotchkiss quick-firing guns in every available  position. He had made a glorious attempt--owned to be magnificent; but  it was not war, and in his failure he recognised that it was not the  game of derring-do, but the game of \"slim\" warfare as played by his  brother Boer which must claim his attention. Now was verified the  prophecy of the Polish apocalypse: \"The war of the future will be a war  of sieges and entrenched positions. In the war of the future the  advantage will always rest with the defensive. In the war of the future,  frontal attacks, without immense superiority in numbers, will be  impossible.\"    Every campaign, they say, has its lessons. This one we now find to be  full of them, so full indeed that it has necessarily taken our Generals  some time to become acquainted even with their grammar. When the war was  forced upon us by the Pretoria oligarchy for the long-cherished purpose  of ousting Great Britain from South Africa, many of the authorities were  of opinion that a rabble of undisciplined farmers would be incapable of  offering any formidable resistance to the superior military system of  Great Britain. Not a hint of doubt as to the success of our arms and the  effectiveness of our war apparatus was entertained. When Colonials in  the summer of '99 volunteered their services, the Government received  the offers with a sniff. Later they accepted them with grateful thanks.  It was never imagined that colonists could know anything of the art of  war, or that they might teach a lesson or two even to that august  institution the Staff College. Those who knew ventured to suggest that  in South Africa the same cast-iron principles that existed in European  warfare would be valueless, and that the lessons of Ingogo and Majuba in  '81 might be repeated in '99 in all their dire and dismal reality. But  these pessimists were scoffed at. They therefore waited, and hoped  against hope. Now and then they feebly wondered by what process  infantry, arriving two months late, when the enemy had had time to  entrench the whole country at various naturally strong strategic points,  would be able to overcome the disadvantages attendant on immobility. But  they were silenced by a look. British pluck and endurance might be  calculated upon to surmount everything and anything--some said! No one  seemed to care to tackle the problem of how men on foot would be enabled  to compete creditably, in anything like equal numbers, with a mounted  enemy possessing more than ordinary mobility.    A mounted enemy has many advantages in his favour. He can select his own  position, he can place all his force _en masse_ into the fighting line,  he can so pick his positions that one man on the defensive can make  himself the equal of three men of the attacking force; and, besides, he  can occupy a length of position which must extend his flanks far beyond  those of the attackers on foot. These in consequence are either forced  to extend to equal length, at almost certain risk of being unable to  reinforce any weak point developed during the attack, and thereby cause  the attack to be broken at points; or they have to \"contain\" only a  portion of the enemy in position, and perhaps leave his wings--or one  "]]]
