The capture of fur bearing animals  has become a science, as mink and fox become more wary so does man  become more skillful in overcoming their shyness. We hear lots of  secrets that were learned of the Indians. No doubt they had some good  ones too, but the white trapper in the same place will outdistance  any Indian I have ever seen or heard of. My experience among those  people is that they are too lazy to use the care that a white man  will use in either setting traps or stretching skins.      * * *    I have had a fox get into my snowshoes tracks and follow a long way  because it was better traveling, says M. H. McAllister. Now that  shows he was not afraid of human scent. Now about iron. How often  does a fox go through a wire fence, or go near an old sugar house  where there are iron gates? That shows he is not afraid of scent of  iron.    Once there was an old trapper here, and the young men wanted him to  show them how to set a fox trap, and he told them he would. So he got  them out to show them how, and this is what he told them: \"Remove all  suspicion and lay a great temptation.\" Well, there it is. Now, in  order to remove all suspicion you must remove all things that are not  natural. A man's tracks and where he has been digging around with a  spade or with his hands are not natural around a spring, are they?  No. Well then, there is where the human scent question comes in. By  instinct he is shown that man is his enemy, and when a man has pawed  the bait over he uses his sense and knows that there is danger, for  it is not natural.      [Illustration: LEFT FOR THE FOXES TO DEVOUR.]    Now I have a question at hand. In one place he is not afraid and  around the trap he is afraid. Now, how does he know when to be afraid  or not? I think because when he sees a piece of bait in a new place  it is not natural. Once last winter I knew where there was a dead  horse and I used to go by it, and one day my brother was with me and  of course he knew I could get a fox there, so to please him I set a  trap, and not another fox came near. Well I smoked that trap, boiled  it in hemlock and then smeared it with tallow, but the fox knew and  never came within ten feet of it again, when they were coming every  night before. When I went by there before I set my trap I left as  much scent as after, and how could he tell when there was a foot of  snow blown there by the wind after I set my trap.    Now they don't appear to be afraid of human scent or iron in some  places and around a trap they are, so now why should they know where  to be shy? Well, because it may be in an unnatural place, unless it  is instinct or good sharp sense. As for scent, I know that rotten  eggs and onions are not natural, although the matrix of the female  fox in the running season is very good. Also such as skunk or muskrat  scent or fish, as it smells rotten and makes a strong smell.    One word to the novice fox trapper, and I will leave space for  something more valuable. You must make things look natural around the  spring and smell natural, and put before them the food that God has  provided for them, and you will have success by placing the trap in  the mud of the spring, and putting a sod on the pan of the trap that  has not been handled by the hand of a human being.        CHAPTER III.    FOXES AND ODOR.    Last winter I could not trap much because the river along which I do  my trapping and the woods all around were full of lumbermen, and I  was afraid my traps would be stolen. I did a little experimenting on  foxes in their relations to the odor of man and iron, says Omer  Carmerk, of Quebec.    The results of my experiences confirmed my previous observation that  foxes are not afraid of the odor of iron, neither of the odor of man,  but mighty suspicious of a bait connected with both odors. I made a  trail about two miles long, scattered about it pieces of meat,  chicken, rabbit, cheese, etc. I dragged a dead chicken, but I set no  trap. Prior to my baiting the trail foxes were crossing it and  following it without hesitation, but after I had put out the bait not  a fox had ventured to cross that trail again.    One day I saw where a fox had come near the trail, stopped, wheeled  about and bounded off like a frightened deer. Another day, a fox  tried to cross it at three different places but could not summon up  enough courage, and at last, by making a long detour he crossed it at  a place where there was no bait, not 20 yards from my cabin. One time  a fox walked parallel to the trail several rods, then came nearer to  it, stopped and turned back at full speed. The same foxes which were  so afraid of my trail were going every night on the public road to  eat horses.      [Illustration: A GOOD RUNNER.]    I will now relate one instance showing that the foxes smell traps.  One day I chopped a chicken on a log. I threw the big pieces in the  middle of three traps I had set the week before and left many small  pieces on the log. The day after the snow around and on the log was  all tramped down by foxes. One fox walked towards the big piece of  meat, and when about two inches from a trap he stopped and turned  back. I have no doubt he smelled the trap. When the traps are in the  snow or wet ground the oxidation of iron produces a peculiar odor  noticeable even to the human nostrils.    One day I was going to look at a trap in a swamp road. My dog was  trotting ahead of me, and when about ten feet from the trap he  stopped and turned around. He detected the odor of the trap for he  had not seen me set it, and he had good reasons to avoid it because  when young he had often been pinched.    Perhaps my experience does not harmonize with that of other trappers,  but the ways of foxes as well as other animals are much influenced by  their surroundings. I have observed that foxes frequenting the  neighborhood of farms are less suspicious than those living in the  deep woods.      * * *    For years, says a Southern trapper, I have invariably caught my fox,  whether in a path, water or bait set; but can I swear my success is  attributable to my extreme precaution? I always smoke traps to kill  the smell of iron then handle them and everything around the setting  with gloves, to erase human scent.    I have found the summer and early fall months the best time to locate  the haunts of the fox, as they are sure to use the same territory in  the winter season. While on one of my recent investigating tours, a  few days after a rain, I observed some facts that will be  interesting.    I struck an old road running through a farm, and readily noticed some  fox tracks. Naturally I followed on and found they led under a wheat  harvester, which had been recently left in the road and on under an  iron gate, into the pasture beyond. All know that a harvester is  largely constructed of iron and steel. Now if the fox is so afraid of  this metal, as is supposed, does it seem reasonable that he would  walk under such a mass of iron, or under an iron gate?    In fox trapping the smoking and smearing process is advocated as well  as the handling with gloves and concealing under the ground. In the  light of my observations, are all these precautions absolutely  necessary? On this same trip, in question, I noticed a fox track, and  as usual followed it. To my surprise the animal went within a hair's  breadth of a plow, passing right on, seemingly not either to care for  red paint or iron construction.    How is it, fox trappers? Does the iron and steel used in farm  implements differ from that used in steel traps, so that the latter  must be handled with such care as is advocated by many of the  trapper's profession? Or is it the covering of the trap with earth  that arouses suspicion?    A red or grey fox will cross through or under a wire fence over the  public highway at night, although the roads are continually traversed  by the iron bound shoes of the horse. Even the tracks of man are  visible here yet we, when trapping, brush out our tracks with great  care.    I have known a fox to follow where a plow has been dragged and have  seen his tracks in the iron marked groove, just made by the locked  wheel of a wagon.    Considering these facts, does it seem possible that the fox has so  great an antipathy to iron and to the human scent as supposed? (We  believe that the conditions under which these are found have much to  do with the foxes shrewdness. A wagon wheel or binder never caught a  fox, but the scent coming from a trap--well that is different. Coming  down to this would appear that the fox has some reasoning power or  intellect.--Editor.)        CHAPTER IV.    CHAFF METHOD, SCENT.    Get some chaff, a bushel will do, and put it out in some good place  where there are foxes, writes a Maine trapper, J. F. Miller. Put some  small pieces of meat in the chaff, (skunk, muskrat or cat is good),  and take a shingle and pound the bed down solid all over. Don't have  any soft place in the bed, and don't handle any of the chaff with  bare hands, or the bait either. Leave it in this shape until you go  on, then get your trap ready to set, but you want your trap clean and  free from rust, and this is a good way to do. Scrape with an old  knife, then use a clean pan and boil in clean water for twenty  minutes, and no fox can smell your trap. Set in edge of bed and cover  in good shape, and make it look as natural as possible, and don't  walk all around in snow, stand in one place and walk in same tracks  when you visit this place, and don't go only every other day.    Now I will tell you of a good way to make a scent that will draw a  fox to a trap. It will draw a fox a number of yards, but it will not  draw them one mile or one half mile, and I doubt if it will one  fourth mile, or any other scent that was ever made or ever will be.  That is my idea of scents, but I know that they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#2)"],[1,"by mice hair and other remains, and if he is feeding  on fish altogether looks the color of silver or the scales of fish.    I have had a world of experience trapping but very limited at  catching, says an Arkansas trapper, yet plenty of both to be fully  capable of solving the question as to whether or not mink are afraid  of the scent of iron. It is simply this. Some mink are positively  afraid of it and some are positively not so. The experience with one  mink that walks into the properly concealed trap and the other old  fellow who makes the short but invariable curve around the same  properly concealed trap is positive proof of this, and few if any  experienced trappers have not had this experience. Either use a scent  the mink likes or boil your traps in ashes. Clean, wipe and keep dry,  and you have a better chance on land at both kinds of mink.    My favorite water set for mink is as follows: Roll a good sized log  (the longer and larger the better) to within six inches of the  water's edge of a stream, pond, or lake, leaving a strip of land  about six inches deep, allowing water to come in and touch log. Throw  mud you remove far away. Don't step on or leave finger or paddle  prints on your strip of land, which is certain to become a mink path.    As soon as tracks indicate this, from land side step on top of log  and place trap in the place you have made and parallel with log,  allowing water to cover well. Staple to log low down and under water  between trap and log, or if you desire to use sliding pole, place  upper end of same under log at this same prepared place and under  water. This log is better than the same set at root of tree, rock, or  stump, for the reason of its convenience to stand or kneel on and  avoid leaving sign while making set, and because when mink reaches  middle of his narrow path he does not like to back out, take deep  water, or climb over the log.    Should he have any suspicions, should he jump clear of your little  water neck, make wider and place two traps or use the same width trap  in soft mud at either edge, and when he jumps he will land deep in  your trap. I caught the largest mink I ever saw with the trap in mud  at edge this way and he pulled the staple and took the trap, but I  found him the same day and the trap, a Newhouse No. 1, had him by the  hind leg above the hock. The old fellow had been jumping my little  neck of water, so I fixed the trap to his convenience and he lit in  it hard.        CHAPTER III.    SIZE AND CARE OF SKINS.    Mink hides handled right bring from a fourth to a half more in market  than the same hides handled indifferently, says an old Iowa trapper  and buyer. Now I will state it more plainly. Take a medium sized  mink, a male one if handled right will be, when stretched properly,  from 20 to 22 inches long, and from 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide at the  tail, tapering gradually to the nose.    Take the same hide, stretch it over a shingle tapered to a point  being 6 or 8 inches wide at base and a foot long, you will get just  half as much for it as the first one.    I have bought small mink hides about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide  at the base--just as you would stretch a muskrat. Take the same hide,  stretch it 15 or 18 inches long, and you have added 25 per cent. to  the value of the hide. I shipped two large mink hide a short while  ago. They were near of a size and color as could be. One was about 12  inches long, the other about 22 inches and well handled otherwise.  One brought 100 per cent. more than the other.      [Illustration: NICELY HANDLED WISCONSIN SKINS.]    I take common laths heavy as I can get, saw them in two in the  center, plane them smooth, taper the ends of the two round the edges,  make a tapering center piece, stretch the hide over the two outside  pieces. Draw the hide down as far as you possibly can. See that the  nose does not slip off the end of the boards. Now tack the hide on  each side of the tail, putting in 4 tacks, allowing room for your  center piece.    Now you are ready for your center piece. Insert it at the bottom,  press it through gradually, but be careful not to tear the hide from  the tacks that you have already driven in. The center piece will not  always go through the full length. The size of the mink regulates  that part of it. One must have different sizes of boards or laths.  Now turn your hide over, pull down the legs of the mink as tight as  you can and tack, using several tacks. I use large tacks No. 12  three-quarters of an inch long, being sharp as needles.    Most trappers use the one piece stretching board, as they claim the  three piece too much trouble. If the one piece is carefully made,  planed on both sides, and about three-eighths inch thick, it is a  good board. A one fourth board after being planed on both sides is  very good.    In this country there are two varieties, which some naturalists have  supposed were distinct species; one small, dark-colored, common in  the Northern and Eastern States and Canada; the other larger, with  lighter-colored, coarser and less valuable fur, common in the Western  and Southern States. The dark-colored variety measures from eleven to  eighteen inches in length from the nose to the root of the tail, and  has a tail from six to ten inches in length.      [Illustration: SOME PRIME N. E. SKINS.]    The lighter-colored is large and is found in the states of Iowa,  Minnesota, Dakota, Manitoba and adjoining Canadian provinces. It has  been known to reach a weight of five pounds.    Trappers claim they have often secured pelts, without  over-stretching, that were 25 inches long, 4 3/8 inches at root of  tail and 3 1/8 inches at neck. This measurement being from root of  tail to end of nose. From tip of tail to end of nose 35 inches. A few  instances of even larger skins are fairly accurately established.    In the Northeast the skins are much smaller for instead of an  occasional five pound mink one that weighs three is considered large.  Owing to the fine fur and darker color it is worth as much if not  more than skins larger, but caught in a more open section, such as  the Dakotas, Iowa, etc. In the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,  Missouri, etc., mink are not so large as Northwestern but larger than  Eastern, yet are not worth as much money owing to their color not  being so good.    In the states bordering on the Ohio River as well as Missouri,  Kansas, Nebraska, etc., there are some cotton mink. In size they may  be as large as any in the section, but the under fur is light, in  fact often white. This greatly lessens their value, so that a  \"cotton\" mink is often classed as a No. 3 or No. 4.    When it is taken into consideration the various shades of mink, dark,  brown, pale and cotton, and sizes from the different sections, to  which are added Nos. 2, 3 and 4, it can be seen that to know all  about the value of mink one must be in touch with all parts of the  country.      [Illustration: LARGE IOWA MINK.]    Many have asked for a standard size by which to grade mink--large,  medium and small. The standard to be based on prime skins of course.    At first such a plan looks reasonable, but after looking at the  suggestion from all sides it does not appear so.    In the first place prime, large mink vary in weight from 3 to 5  pounds, depending in what section caught. The five pound skin,  usually from an open country, is pale and not so finely furred as a 3  pound one from the Northern New England States or Eastern Canada.    Again, were mink graded by a standard size, they would be  over-stretched.    A dealer who we believe tries to treat all fairly submits the  following measurements for the three sizes--large, medium and small:    Large, 22 inches long, 4 wide at tail, 3 1/2 at neck.    Medium, 18 inches long, 3 1/4 wide at tail, 2 5/8 at neck.    Small, 14 inches long, 2 3/4 wide at tail, 2 1/4 at neck.    The figures are from root of tail (tail not measured) to end of nose.    The measurements as given are intended to be general, including skins  from Southern, Central, Western and Northwestern sections, with the  exceptions already noted, but at the same time it must be kept in  mind that all skins the same size are not worth the same.    It is a good idea to stretch the pelts as soon after removed from the  animal as possible. If allowed to lay around for hours the pelt will  be hard to stretch to its normal size.    If you find a mink drowned and thoroughly water soaked, take it by  the head, just like you were cracking a whip, then by the hind legs  and crack it the same way. The mink will soon be dry. If muddy it  should be washed first.    Pelts should not be put on the boards when the fur is wet. They  should also be removed as soon as thoroughly dry, that is, after the  skin will not shrink. They should be left on boards from three days  to a week, depending on the weather. Do not turn after removing from  boards, but have flesh side out.        CHAPTER IV.    GOOD AND LASTING BAITS.    Animals are not afraid of smoked baits, and in the early and late  parts of the trapping season it is a positive benefit to slightly  smoke the bait; it lasts so much longer than fresh meat and hangs on  to the bait stick until almost the last shred, and if an animal turns  from the trap house without biting it, it is because he is not  hungry.    The baits I have found the most enduring and most likely to tempt an  animal are--first and always the muskrat. All animals, that is bear,  mink, fox and marten will bite at this bait when they will not  consider any other. For a bear trap, use one whole rat, take out the  inside (because the inside will cause it to decay quicker), have the  rat slightly smoked, just enough to stiffen the meat, then have a  sharp pointed stick, about three feet long, run the stick through the  two thighs, up along the back bone, through the neck stopping at the  skull.
