[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#2)"],[1,"sps\": passim.--Translator's Note.); there is no need to  linger over them here.    The most important matter has escaped me. What I wanted, what I still  want to see is the Pompilus engaged in mortal combat with the Lycosa.  What a duel, in which the cunning of the one has to overcome the  terrible weapons of the other! Does the Wasp enter the burrow to  surprise the Tarantula at the bottom of her lair? Such temerity would  be fatal to her. Where the big Bumble-bee dies an instant death, the  audacious visitor would perish the moment she entered. Is not the other  there, facing her, ready to snap at the back of her head, inflicting  a wound which would result in sudden death? No, the Pompilus does not  enter the Spider's parlour, that is obvious. Does she surprise the  Spider outside her fortress? But the Lycosa is a stay-at-home animal; I  do not see her straying abroad during the summer. Later, in the autumn,  when the Pompili have disappeared, She wanders about; turning gipsy, she  takes the open air with her numerous family, which she carries on her  back. Apart from these maternal strolls, she does not appear to me to  leave her castle; and the Pompilus, I should think, has no great  chance of meeting her outside. The problem, we perceive, is becoming  complicated: the huntress cannot make her way into the burrow, where  she would risk sudden death; and the Spider's sedentary habits make an  encounter outside the burrow improbable. Here is a riddle which would  be interesting to decipher. Let us endeavour to do so by observing other  Spider-hunters; analogy will enable us to draw a conclusion.    I have often watched Pompili of every species on their  hunting-expeditions, but I have never surprised them entering the  Spider's lodging when the latter was at home. Whether this lodging be a  funnel plunging its neck into a hole in some wall, an awning stretched  amid the stubble, a tent modelled upon the Arab's, a sheath formed of a  few leaves bound together, or a net with a guard-room attached, whenever  the owner is indoors the suspicious Pompilus holds aloof. When the  dwelling is vacant, it is another matter: the Wasp moves with arrogant  ease over those webs, springes and cables in which so many other insects  would remain ensnared. The silken threads do not seem to have any hold  upon her. What is she doing, exploring those empty webs? She is watching  to see what is happening on the adjacent webs where the Spider is  ambushed. The Pompilus therefore feels an insuperable reluctance to make  straight for the Spider when the latter is at home in the midst of  her snares. And she is right, a hundred times over. If the Tarantula  understands the practice of the dagger-thrust in the neck, which is  immediately fatal, the other cannot be unacquainted with it. Woe then to  the imprudent Wasp who presents herself upon the threshold of a Spider  of approximately equal strength!    Of the various instances which I have collected of this cautious reserve  on the Spider-huntress' part I will confine myself to the following,  which will be sufficient to prove my point. By joining, with silken  strands, the three folioles which form the leaf of Virgil's cytisus, a  Spider has built herself a green arbour, a horizontal sheath, open at  either end. A questing Pompilus comes upon the scene, finds the game to  her liking and pops in her head at the entrance of the cell. The Spider  immediately retreats to the other end. The huntress goes round the  Spider's dwelling and reappears at the other door. Again the Spider  retreats, returning to the first entrance. The Wasp also returns to it,  but always by the outside. Scarcely has she done so, when the Spider  rushes for the opposite opening; and so on for fully a quarter of an  hour, both of them coming and going from one end of the cylinder to the  other, the Spider inside and the Pompilus outside.    The quarry was a valuable one, it seems, since the Wasp persisted for a  long time in her attempts, which were invariably defeated; however, the  huntress had to abandon them, baffled by this perpetual running to and  fro. The Pompilus made off; and the Spider, once more on the watch,  patiently awaited the heedless Midges. What should the Wasp have done  to capture this much-coveted game? She should have entered the verdant  cylinder, the Spider's dwelling, and pursued the Spider direct, in her  own house, instead of remaining outside, going from one door to the  other. With such swiftness and dexterity as hers, it seemed to me  impossible that the stroke should fail: the quarry moved clumsily, a  little sideways, like a Crab. I judged it to be an easy matter; the  Pompilus thought it highly dangerous. To-day I am of her opinion: if  she had entered the leafy tube, the mistress of the house would have  operated on her neck and the huntress would have become the quarry.    Years passed and the paralyser of the Spiders still refused to reveal  her secret; I was badly served by circumstances, could find no leisure,  was absorbed in unrelenting preoccupations. At length, during my last  year at Orange, the light dawned upon me. My garden was enclosed by an  old wall, blackened and ruined by time, where, in the chinks between the  stones, lived a population of Spiders, represented more particularly by  Segestria perfidia. This is the common Black Spider, or Cellar Spider.  She is deep black all over, excepting the mandibles, which are a  splendid metallic green. Her two poisoned daggers look like a product of  the metal-worker's art, like the finest bronze. In any mass of abandoned  masonry there is not a quiet corner, not a hole the size of one's  finger, in which the Segestria does not set up house. Her web is a  widely flaring funnel, whose open end, at most a span across, lies  spread upon the surface of the wall, where it is held in place by  radiating threads. This conical surface is continued by a tube which  runs into a hole in the wall. At the end is the dining-room to which the  Spider retires to devour at her ease her captured prey.    With her two hind-legs stuck into the tube to obtain a purchase and the  six others spread around the orifice, the better to perceive on every  side the quiver which gives the signal of a capture, the Segestria  waits motionless, at the entrance of her funnel, for an insect to become  entangled in the snare. Large Flies, Drone-flies, dizzily grazing some  thread of the snare with their wings, are her usual victims. At the  first flutter of the netted Fly, the Spider runs or even leaps forward,  but she is now secured by a cord which escapes from the spinnerets and  which has its end fastened to the silken tube. This prevents her from  falling as she darts along a vertical surface. Bitten at the back of the  head, the Drone-fly is dead in a moment; and the Segestria carries him  into her lair.    Thanks to this method and these hunting-appliances--an ambush at the  bottom of a silken whirlpool, radiating snares, a life-line which holds  her from behind and allows her to take a sudden rush without risking  a fall--the Segestria is able to catch game less inoffensive than the  Drone-fly. A Common Wasp, they tell me, does not daunt her. Though I  have not tested this, I readily believe it, for I well know the Spider's  boldness.    This boldness is reinforced by the activity of the venom. It is enough  to have seen the Segestria capture some large Fly to be convinced of the  overwhelming effect of her fangs upon the insects bitten in the  neck. The death of the Drone-fly, entangled in the silken funnel,  is reproduced by the sudden death of the Bumble-bee on entering the  Tarantula's burrow. We know the effect of the poison on man, thanks  to Antoine Duges' investigations. (Antoine Louis Duges (1797-1838), a  French physician and physiologist, author of a \"Traite de  physiologie comparee de l'homme et des animaux\" and other scientific  works.--Translator's Note.) Let us listen to the brave experimenter:    \"The treacherous Segestria, or Great Cellar Spider, reputed poisonous  in our part of the country, was chosen for the principal subject of our  experiments. She was three-quarters of an inch long, measured from the  mandibles to the spinnerets. Taking her in my fingers from behind, by  the legs, which were folded and gathered together (this is the way to  catch hold of live Spiders, if you would avoid their bite and master  them without mutilating them), I placed her on various objects and on  my clothes, without her manifesting the least desire to do any harm; but  hardly was she laid on the bare skin of my fore-arm when she seized a  fold of the epidermis in her powerful mandibles, which are of a metallic  green, and drove her fangs deep into it. For a few moments she remained  hanging, although left free; then she released herself, fell and fled,  leaving two tiny wounds, a sixth of an inch apart, red, but hardly  bleeding, with a slight extravasation round the edge and resembling the  wounds produced by a large pin.    \"At the moment of the bite, the sensation was sharp enough to deserve  the name of pain; and this continued for five or six minutes more, but  not so forcibly. I might compare it with the sensation produced by the  stinging-nettle. A whitish tumefaction almost immediately surrounded the  two pricks; and the circumference, within a radius of about an inch, was  coloured an erysipelas red, accompanied by a very slight swelling. In an  hour and a half, it had all disappeared, except the mark of the pricks,  which persisted for several days, as any other small wound would  have done. This was in September, in rather cool weather. Perhaps the  symptoms would have displayed somewhat greater severity at a warmer  season.\"    Without being serious, the effect of the Segestria's poison is plainly  marked. A sting causing sharp pain and swelling, with the redness of  erysipelas, is no trifling matter. While Duges' experiment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34634"],[0,"A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook (#2)"],[1," characterised them, seemed still to glow in  every bosom, and to animate every countenance.    The next day, February the twelfth, the ships were put under a taboo, by  the chiefs, a solemnity, it seems, that was requisite to be observed  before Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu), the king, paid his first visit to Captain  Cook, after his return. He waited upon him the same day, on board the  \"Resolution,\" attended by a large train, some of which bore the presents  designed for Captain Cook, who received him in his usual friendly  manner, and gave him several articles in return. This amicable ceremony  being settled, the taboo was dissolved, matters went on in the usual  train, and the next day, February the thirteenth, we were visited by the  natives in great numbers; the \"Resolution's\" mast was landed, and the  astronomical observatories erected on their former situation. I landed,  with another gentleman, at the town of Kavaroah (Kaawaloa), where we  found a great number of canoes, just arrived from different parts of the  island, and the Indians busy in constructing temporary huts on the  beach, for their residence during the stay of the ships. On our return  on board the \"Discovery,\" we learned that an Indian had been detected in  stealing the armourer's tongs from the forge, for which he received a  pretty severe flogging, and was sent out of the ship. Notwithstanding  the example made of this man, in the afternoon another had the audacity  to snatch the tongs and a chizel from the same place, with which he  jumped overboard, and swam for the shore. The master and a midshipman  were instantly dispatched after him, in the small cutter. The Indian  seeing himself pursued, made for a canoe: his countrymen took him on  board, and paddled as swift as they could towards the shore; we fired  several muskets at them, but to no effect, for they soon got out of the  reach of our shot. Pareah (Palea), one of the chiefs, who was at that  time on board the \"Discovery,\" understanding what had happened,  immediately went ashore, promising to bring back the stolen goods. Our  boat was so far distanced, in chasing the canoe which had taken the  chief on board, that he had time to make his escape into the country.  Captain Cook, who was then on shore, endeavoured to intercept his  landing; but it seems, that he was led out of the way by some of the  natives, who had officiously intruded themselves as guides. As the  master was approaching near the landing-place, he was met by some of the  Indians in a canoe; they had brought back the tongs and chizel, together  with another article, that we had not missed, which happened to be the  lid of the water-cask. Having recovered these things, he was returning  on board, when he was met by the \"Resolution's\" pinnace, with five men  in her, who, without any orders, had come from the observatories to his  assistance. Being thus unexpectedly reinforced, he thought himself  strong enough to insist upon having the thief, or the canoe which took  him in, delivered up as reprizals. With that view he turned back; and  having found the canoe on the beach, he was preparing to launch it into  the water when Pareah (Palea) made his appearance, and insisted upon his  not taking it away, as it was his property. The officer not regarding  him, the chief seized upon him, pinioned his arms behind, and held him  by the hair of his head: on which, one of the sailors struck him with an  oar: Pareah (Palea) instantly quitted the officer, snatched the oar out  of the man's hand, and snapped it in two across his knee. At length, the  multitude began to attack our people with stones. They made some  resistance, but were soon overpowered, and obliged to swim for safety to  the small cutter, which lay farther out than the pinnace. The officers,  not being expert swimmers, retreated to a small rock in the water, where  they were closely pursued by the Indians. One man darted a broken oar at  the master; but his foot slipping at the time, he missed him, which  fortunately saved that officer's life. At last, Pareah (Palea)  interfered, and put an end to their violence. The Gentlemen, knowing  that his presence was their only defense against the fury of the  natives, entreated him to stay with them, till they could get off in the  boats; but that he refused, and left them. The master went to seek  assistance from the party at the observatories; but the midshipman chose  to remain in the pinnace. He was very rudely treated by the mob, who  plundered the boat of everything that was loose on board, and then began  to knock her to pieces, for the sake of the ironwork: but Pareah (Palea)  fortunately returned in time to prevent her destruction. He had met the  other gentleman on his way to the observatories, and suspecting his  errand, had forced him to return. He dispersed the crowd again, and  desired the gentlemen to return on board; they represented, that all the  oars had been taken out of the boat: on which he brought some of them  back, and the gentlemen were glad to get off, without further  molestation. They had not proceeded far, before they were overtaken by  Pareah (Palea), in a canoe; he delivered the midshipman's cap, which had  been taken from him in the scuffle, joined noses with them, in token of  reconciliation, and was anxious to know, if Captain Cook would kill him  for what had happened. They assured him of the contrary, and made signs  of friendship to him in return. He then left them, and paddled over to  the town of Kavaroah (Kaawaloa), and that was the last time we ever saw  him. Captain Cook returned on board soon after, much displeased with the  whole of this disagreeable business; and the same night, sent a  lieutenant on board the \"Discovery,\" to learn the particulars of it, as  it had originated in that ship.    It was remarkable, that in the midst of the hurry and confusion  attending this affair, Kanynah[3] (Kanaina), a chief who had always been  on terms particularly friendly with us, came from the spot where it  happened, with a hog to sell on board the \"Discovery:\" it was of an  extraordinary large size, and he demanded for it a pahowa (pahoa), or  dagger, of an unusual length. He pointed to us, that it must be as long  as his arm. Captain Clerke not having one of that length, told him, he  would get one made for him by the morning; with which being satisfied,  he left the hog, and went ashore without making any stay with us. It  will not be altogether foreign to the subject, to mention a  circumstance, that happened to-day on board the \"Resolution.\" An Indian  Chief asked Captain Cook at his table, if he was a Tata Toa (Hakaka  Koa); which means a fighting man, or a soldier. Being answered in the  affirmative, he desired to see his wounds: Captain Cook held out his  right-hand, which had a scar upon it, dividing the thumb from the  finger, the whole length of the metacarpal bones. The Indian, being thus  convinced of his being a Toa (Koa), put the same question to another  gentleman present, but he happened to have none of those distinguishing  marks: the chief then said, that he himself was a Toa (Koa), and showed  the scars of some wounds he had received in battle. Those who were on  duty at the observatories, were disturbed during the night, with shrill  and melancholy sounds, issuing from the adjacent villages, which they  took to be the lamentations of the women. Perhaps the quarrel between  us, might have filled their minds with apprehensions for the safety of  their husbands: but, be that as it may, their mournful cries struck the  sentinels with unusual awe and terror.    To widen the breach between us, some of the Indians in the night, took  away the \"Discovery's\" large cutter, which lay swamped at the buoy of  one of her anchors: they had carried her off so quietly, that we did not  miss her till the morning, Sunday, February the fourteenth. Captain  Clerke lost no time in waiting upon Captain Cook, to acquaint him with  the accident; he returned on board, with orders for the launch and small  cutter to go, under the command of the second lieutenant, and lie off  the east point of the bay, in order to intercept all canoes that might  attempt to get out; and, if he found it necessary, to fire upon them. At  the same time, the third lieutenant of the \"Resolution,\" with the launch  and small cutter, was sent on the same service, to the opposite point of  the bay; and the master was dispatched in the large cutter, in pursuit  of a double canoe, already under sail, making the best of her way out of  the harbour. He soon came up with her, and by firing a few muskets,  drove her on shore, and the Indians left her: this happened to be the  canoe of Omea (Mea), a man who bore the title of Orono (Lono). He was on  board himself, and it would have been fortunate, if our people had  secured him, for his person was held as sacred as that of the king.  During this time, Captain Cook was preparing to go ashore himself, at  the town of Kavaroah (Kaawaloa), in order to secure the person of  Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu), before he should have time to withdraw himself to  another part of the island, out of our reach. This appeared the most  effectual step that could be taken on the present occasion, for the  recovery of the boat. It was the measure he had invariably pursued, in  similar cases, at other islands in these seas, and it had always been  attended with the desired success: in fact, it would be difficult to  point out any other mode of proceeding on these emergencies, likely to  attain the object in view. We had reason to suppose, that the king and  his attendants had fled when the alarm was first given; in that case, it  was Captain Cook's intention to secure the large canoes which were  hauled upon the beach. He left the ship about seven o'clock, attended by  the lieutenant of marines, a serjeant, corporal, and seven private men:  the pinnace's crew were also armed, and under the command of Mr. "]]]
