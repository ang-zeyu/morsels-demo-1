His  Majesty the Kaiser will then graciously change the \"no-account\" words  on our family's escutcheon to the joyful motto, \"Mit Geld,\" and lift  the blighting curse from our noble house.'\"    Next I related how surprised I was when I saw the great city of New  York. However, I expected to see a large city of many houses, ever so  high and some higher yet, and therefore I was not so very much  surprised, after all. But in Illinois I first saw the wonderful forest.  Oh, the virgin forest! Never had I seen such grand, beautiful trees,  oak and hickory, ash and sycamore, maple, elm, and many more giant  trees, unknown to me, and peopled by a multitude of wild birds of the  brightest plumage. There were birds and squirrels everywhere! I  actually saw a sky-blue bird with a topknot, and another of a bright  scarlet color, and gorgeous woodpeckers who were too busy hammering to  look at me even. Oh, but they did not sing like the birds in Germany!  All were very grave and sad. They seemed to know, as everybody else  did, that I was a stranger in their land, for they gave me all sorts of  useful Information and advice, with many nods of their little heads.    \"Peep, peep!\" counseled the bluebird. \"Thank you,\" I replied, \"seeing  is believing.\" \"Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will,\" cried a large, spotted  bird. \"That,\" thought I, \"is a prize fighter.\" \"Cheat, cheat!\" urged a  pious-looking cardinal, who evidently mistook me for a gambler.  \"Don't,\" roared a bullfrog, who was seated on a log and winked his eye  at me. \"There is an honest man,\" I thought. \"Shake, good sir.\" In  consternation and surprise, I instantly released his hand. \"HOW is it  possible to be both honest and slippery at the same time! This must be  a Yankee-man,\" thought I. I saw real moss, green and velvety as the  richest carpet, and I drank of singing, bubbling waters. Many kinds of  berries and nuts, hard to crack, grew in the wild glens of the forest.  I gathered flowers, larger and more beautiful than any I had ever seen,  but they lacked the perfume of German flowers; only the roses were the  same.    Many children did I see, but they had not the rosy cheeks of German  children. And I met the strongest of all beasts on earth and tracked  him to his native lair; and there, in the sacred groves of the Illini,  I worried him sorely, and as David did unto Goliath, so did I unto him;  and sundown come, I slew him. And for three-score days and ten the  smoke of battle scented the balmy air.    The young ladles laughed heartily and said that never before had they  been so delightfully entertained, and they gave me sweets and nice  things to eat, and said they hoped I might stay with them forever and a  day. We exchanged confidences, and they warned me to beware of the  landlord, who had been known to rob people. They advised me to secrete  my money, if perchance I had any. I thanked them kindly, replying that  I had only one dollar in my purse. This was true, but I did not tell  them that I had sewed a large sum in banknotes and some German silver  into my kite's tail when I set out on my journey to the West.    I complimented these charming girls on their good fortune to be in the  service of so generous a gentleman as their landlord seemed to be; for  I saw that they wore very fine dresses and had many jewels. \"Why, you  little greenie,\" said Miss Rose, \"he does not pay us high wages.\" \"Oh,  I see, how romantic! how nice!\" exclaimed I. \"You do as the ladies in  the good old time of chivalry, when knights donned their colors and  sallied forth to battle with lions and tigers. You crave largesse, and  the gentlemen favor you with money and jewels.\" Then the youngest girl  laughed and said, \"Oh, you pore, innicent bairn, and how do yez ken all  this? and how did yez know that Misther Payterson kapes a tiger at all,  at all, begorra!\" Another young lady said, \"Dutchy, I reckon yore daddy  is a right smart cunning old fox!\" \"Madame,\" replied I, indignantly,  \"my father is no fox, but a minister of the Gospel.\" \"Oh, this bye is  the son of a praste,\" screamed the loveliest girl in all Missouri.  \"Indade, I misthrusted the little scamp. Och! oh and where is me  brooch? I thought all the time the little divvil was afther something.  Thieves! Murther!\" Confusion in pandemonium now reigned supreme. For  one precious moment the air seemed full of long-legged stockings and  delicate hands and purses. Luckily, the brooch was found and peace  restored at once. And Rose said, \"Oh, girls, how could you!\" and she  begged my pardon and said they did not mean it. And then I made myself  very useful and agreeable to these lovely maids, lacing their shoes and  dusting their chamber, and right gallantly did I serve them until  evening.    After supper reappeared my evil genius in the person of the landlord,  who took me out to the woodshed. \"Dutchy, I have decided to adopt you  as my only son; have you ever bucked a wood saw?\" said he, and a  sardonic leer distorted his evil features. After I recovered  sufficiently from the shock, I answered indignantly, \"Sir, know ye not  that I have pledged my service to the vestal virgins of yon temple?\"  \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the villain, \"get busy now, son, and if by morning  this wood has not been cut, you will go minus your breakfast.\"  Thereupon he locked me in.    Caught as a rat in a trap, I had no alternative but to comply with this  man's outrageous demands. Despairingly I plied that abominable  instrument of torture, the national bucksaw of America. This is the  only American institution I could never accustom myself to. I have  endured bucking bronchos in New Mexico, I have bucked the tiger in  Arizona, but to buck a wood-saw--perish the thought! Sore and weary, I  lay down in a corner of the shed on some hay and fell asleep. I dreamed  that I heard screams of women, mingled with song and laughter, and  through it all the noise of music and dancing. Then the dream changed  into a horrible nightmare in the shape of a big sawhorse which kicked  at me and threatened me with hard labor.    Toward morning, when the door was opened and a drunken ruffian entered,  I awoke from my troubled slumbers. \"Hi, Dutchy, and have yez any tin?\"  he threatened. \"Kind sir,\" I replied, \"when I departed for the West I  left all my wealth behind me.\" Verily, now I was proving myself the  worthy scion of valiant men, who had laid aside hauberk, sword, and  lance, taken up the Bible and stole, and thenceforth fought only with  the weapon of Samson, the strong!    \"And so yez are, by special appointment, chamberlain to the gurruls by  day, and ivver sawing wood at nighttime! Bedad! I'll shpile the thrick  for Misther Payterson, the thaving baste, and take this little  greenhorn out of his clutches and sind him about his business.\" With  these words, he opened the door for me and I escaped.    Farewell, lovely maids of Kansas and Missouri! If mayhap this writing  comes to you, oh, let us meet again; my heart yearns to greet you and  your granddaughters. For surely, though it seems to me as yesterday,  the blossoms of forty summers have fallen in our path and whitened our  hair.          CHAPTER II.    PERILOUS JOURNEY      After several days I arrived at the end of my railway journey, Junction  City, without delay or accident. The trip was not lacking in  interesting details. The monotony of the never ending prairie was at  times enlivened by herds of buffalo and antelope. On one occasion they  delayed our train for several hours. An enormous herd of thousands upon  thousands of buffalo crossed the railroad track in front of our train.  Bellowing, crowding, and pushing, they were not unlike the billows of  an angry sea as it crashes and foams over the submerged rocks of a  dangerous coast. Their rear guard was made up of wolves, large and  small. They followed the herd stealthily, taking advantage of every  hillock and tuft of buffalo grass to hide themselves. The gray wolf or  lobo, larger and heavier than any dog, and adorned with a bushy tall  was a fierce-looking animal, to be sure. The smaller ones were called  coyotes or prairie wolves, and are larger than foxes and of a  gray-brown color. These are the scavengers of the plains, and divide  their prey with the vultures of the air.    At times we passed through villages of the prairie dog, consisting of  numberless little mounds, with their owners sitting erect on top. When  alarmed, they would yelp and dive into their lairs in the earth. These  little rodents share their habitations with a funny-looking little owl  and the rattlesnake. I believe, however, that the snake is not there as  a welcome visitor, but comes in the role of a self-appointed assessor  and tax gatherer. I picked up and adopted a little bulldog which had  been either abandoned on the cars or lost by its owner, not then  thinking that this little Cerberus, as I called it, should later prove,  on one occasion, to be my true and only friend when I was in dire  distress and in the extremity of peril.    The town of Junction City, which numbered less than a score of  buildings and tents, was in a turmoil of excitement, resembling a nest  of disturbed hornets. Several hundred angry-looking men crowded the  only street, every one armed to the teeth. The great majority were  dark-skinned Mexicans, but here and there I noticed the American  frontiersman, the professional buffalo hunter and scout. These were men  of proved courage, and I observed that the Mexicans avoided looking  them squarely In the face; and when meeting on the public thoroughfare,  they invariably gave them precedence of passage.    I found opportunity to hire out to a pleasant-looking young Mexican as  driver of a little two-mule provision wagon. In this manner I earned my  passage across the plains. Don Jose Lopez, that was his name, said that  I need not do much actual work, as he would have his peons "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#2)"],[1,"that he involuntarily glanced over his  shoulder at the marble-topped table near by, half expecting to see an  appetizing dish of eatables at his side. No one had entered, however,  and the table was as usual, with only its album and gilt-mounted  screen, flanked by a few books that were too choice to be hidden away  on the library shelves. When he looked back at the picture in the  book, he started and rubbed his eyes. He thought--but it could not  have been possible--that the central figure on the page moved  slightly; and he was positive that one of the Ghost's arms, in the  engraving, had been raised, while now both were at his side.    Mr. Broadstreet turned back the leaf with some misgiving, and looked  carefully behind it. Nothing but blank white paper.    \"H'm,\" muttered Mr. Broadstreet to himself, \"how a man's fancy does  play strange tricks with--Halloo!\"    He was once more glancing at the picture, when the jolly Ghost gave  him an unmistakable wink.    To say that the lawyer started, was astonished, struck dumb--would be  mild. He sat staring at the page, not wholly believing his own eyes,  and yet not liking to look upon such a--to say the least--peculiar  picture.    While he was in this bewildered state of mind a rich, jovial voice was  heard, apparently at a great distance, and at the same time proceeding  directly from the book he held in his hand; and--yes, no doubt about  it--the Ghost's bearded lips were moving.    \"Well?\" said the Ghost of Christmas Present, still seeming very, very  far off.    \"Well, sir?\" stammered Mr. Broadstreet, in return.    \"You see I'm not dead yet, although some of your good people on this  side of the water pay precious little attention to me.\"    \"Why, really,\" said Mr. Broadstreet, instinctively arguing the  opposite side of the question, \"as to that, I'm not so sure. Take  Christmas cards, now. A few years ago they were unknown; now they're  as common as valentines.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" replied the Ghost, \"I know. You see I have my room pretty  well decorated with them.\"    The lawyer scrutinized the background of the picture more carefully,  and, sure enough, the walls were covered with what at first seemed a  rich sort of illuminated paper, but proved to be composed entirely of  Christmas cards, many of which he had never seen. Even in the  momentary glance he gave, he observed that those which had taken  prizes and had been most largely advertised during the past few  winters, were tucked away in obscure corners, while several which were  exceedingly simple in design and text occupied the most prominent  positions.    \"Yes,\" the Ghost went on, \"the cards are well enough in their way, and  so are the other displays and festivities of the day. But it is the  spirit of Christmas that you need. Charity, charity in its good old  sense: open hearts and kind deeds, with less thought of self-pleasing.  While these dainty little gifts are being manufactured, purchased,  sent, and thrown away, hundreds of people are at starvation's door in  your own city; thousands of people know little or nothing of the real  meaning of the day, or of its Founder.\"    As the Ghost spoke, its voice seemed to come nearer, and at the same  time the book grew so large and heavy that Mr. Broadstreet was fain to  set it down upon the carpet. He no longer feared the Ghost, nor did it  seem strange that it should converse with him in this manner.    \"Wherein are we deficient?\" he asked eagerly. \"Or what more can we do?  The charitable institutions of Boston are among the best in the world,  the sky is full of her church-steeples, her police and missionary  forces are vigilant and effective in their work.\"    The Ghost of Christmas Present gave a toss to his long hair and  beard.    \"How much have you done to carry the spirit of Christmastide beyond  your own threshold? Who in this great city will cherish the day and  love it more dearly for your warm human friendship and kindly act,  until it symbolizes to them whatever is purest and merriest and  holiest in life?\"    The Ghost's voice, now grown very near, was rather sad than stern, and  its eyes were fixed intently upon Mr. Broadstreet's face.    Mr. Broadstreet hesitated. With cross-examination he was familiar  enough, but he did not relish the part of witness. So confused was he  that he hardly noticed that book and picture were now so large that  they quite filled the end of the room in which he was sitting, and  seemed like another apartment opening out of his own.    \"I--I--hardly know,\" he stammered. \"Really, I've spent a good deal of  money; my Christmas bills are always tremendous, but I suppose it's  mostly in the family.\"    \"Mind,\" interrupted the Ghost, almost sharply, \"I don't say anything  against the good cheer and merriment at home. But there are many homes  within a stone's throw of your chair, where there will be no fine  dinner, no presents, no meeting of friends, no tree,--nothing but  anxiety and doubt and despair. Your dressing-gown would provide for  several of them.\"    Mr. Broadstreet looked meekly at the embroidery upon his sleeves.    \"What would you have me do?\" he asked.    \"Do you desire to perform your part toward making the morrow bright  for some one who otherwise would find it all clouds? Do you wish to  plant seeds of love and mercy and tenderness in some heart that has  heretofore borne only thistles? To bring a smile to some weary face,  warmth to shivering limbs, light and hope to dreary lives?\"    \"I do! I do!\" exclaimed the rich man, eagerly starting up from his  chair.    \"And are you ready to sacrifice your ease and comfort, this stormy  night, for such as they?\"    Mr. Broadstreet seized his fur cap and ulster from the rack in the  hall. \"Try me!\" he cried. \"I'm ready for anything!\"    The Ghost smiled pleasantly upon him, at the same time seeming to lift  its hand involuntarily, as in blessing. Then it spoke for the last  time.    \"Hitherto you have known only the bright side of Christmas,\" it said  gently. \"It has been full of joy to you and yours. But there are those  among your fellow creatures, nay, among your very neighbors, who dwell  in such continued misery that when Christmas comes it but reminds them  of their unhappy state, and by its excess of light upon others deepens  the gloom about themselves. This is the Shadow of Christmas Present,  and it falls heavily upon many a heart and many a household, where the  day, with its good cheer and blessed associations, should bring naught  but delight.\" The kind Spirit's voice wavered slightly. \"I, myself,  can do but little to dispel this shadow. It grieves me sorely, year  by year, but it remains, and I fear I sometimes but make it worse,  with my bluff ways and keen winter breezes. It is for those who love  me most to carry such light and comfort to those upon whom it rests,  that it shall be banished never to return. The shadow grows less year  by year, but it is still broad, broad.\"    The Ghost was silent a moment. It beckoned to the other, and motioned  to him to step behind it. \"In my Shadow you shall move to-night,\" it  concluded, in a firmer voice. \"It shall accompany you wherever you go,  and your work shall be to turn it away, with whatever kind deeds your  hand shall find to do, or cheering words you may have the power to  speak.\"    It said no more. Mr. Broadstreet, who, when a child, had often longed  to peep behind a picture, found himself actually fulfilling his wish.  As he drew nearer the printed page, he heard a dull roar, like surf  beating upon a rocky coast. He advanced further, picking his way  around the pile of poultry and vegetables and glistening holly upon  which the Ghost sat enthroned. A moment more and the room vanished in  utter blackness of night, the roar grew grander and deeper, until it  throbbed in his ears like the diapason of a mighty organ, a fierce  blast of snow-laden wind struck his bewildered face, the street-lamp  upon the corner flickered feebly in a mist of flakes--he was standing  before his own door, knee-deep in a snow-drift, and buffeted above,  below, and on every side by the storm that was abroad that Christmas  Eve.      II    As soon as Mr. Broadstreet recovered himself and cleared his eyes from  the blinding snow, he saw a heavy, black Shadow on the sidewalk  enveloping his own person and resting upon the figure of a man who had  evidently just sheltered himself behind the high stone steps, for his  footprints leading from the street were still quite fresh. As the man  thrashed his arms and stamped vigorously, to start the blood through  his benumbed feet, a bright button or two gleamed upon his breast  through the cape of his greatcoat. Mr. Broadstreet now recognized him  as the policeman whose beat it was, and whom he had occasionally  favored with a condescending nod, as he came home late at night from  the theater or the club. He had never addressed him by so much as a  word, but now the Shadow was full upon him, and Mr. Broadstreet felt  that here was his first opportunity.    \"Good-evening, officer!\" he shouted cheerily, through the storm. \"Wish  you a Merry Christmas to-morrow.\"    \"Thank you, sir; same to you,\" replied the other, with a touch of the  cap and a pleased glance at the great man. \"Hard times for the boys  to-night, though.\"    \"It _is_ hard,\" said Mr. Broadstreet compassionately. \"And you're  rather cold, I suppose?\" he added awkwardly, after a pause.    \"Rather!\"    \"Why, bless me,\" a bright thought striking him, \"wouldn't you like a  cup of hot coffee, now?\"    The officer looked up again, surprised. \"I would that, sir,  first-rate,\" he answered heartily.    Mr. Broadstreet stepped to the side door and pressed the electric  knob.    \"Bring out a good cup of coffee for this man,\" he said to the girl who  answered the bell. \"And, officer, buy the folks at home a trifle for  me; Christmas, you know.\" As he spoke, he put a big silver dollar into  the astonished"]]]
