Seeking for these is  his constant occupation, as he hops along a branch, now peering into  some crevice of the bark or nook among the foliage, ever uttering his  pretty song during the interval between swallowing the last worm and  finding the next.    The nest of the Red-eye is built in a horizontal branch of a tree,  usually in a small sapling that responds to all the caprices of the  wind, thus acting as a cradle for the little ones within. The nest is  cup-like in shape, and always dependent from small twigs, around which  its upper edges are firmly bound, with a canopy of leaves overhead. It  is woven of a variety of materials, fine strips of bark, fibres of  vegetables, and webs of spiders and caterpillars. It is said that two  nests of the same species are rarely found alike. Some are built of  paper fibres, and bits of hornets' nests, and another may be a perfect  collection of scraps of all sorts.    The eggs are three or four, white with a few black or umber specks about  the larger end.    It was in the nest of the Red-eyed Vireo that Hamilton Gibson found  twisted a bit of newspaper, whose single legible sentence read: \"* * *  have in view the will of God.\"*          THE EARLY OWL.          An Owl once lived in a hollow tree,      And he was as wise as wise could be.      The branch of learning he didn't know      Could scarce on the tree of knowledge grow,      He knew the tree from branch to root,      And an owl like that can afford to hoot.        And he hooted--until, alas! one day,      He chanced to hear, in a casual way,      An insignificant little bird      Make use of a term he had never heard.      He was flying to bed in the dawning light      When he heard her singing with all her might,      \"Hurray! hurray! for the early worm!\"      \"Dear me,\" said the owl, \"what a singular term!      I would look it up if it weren't so late,      I must rise at dusk to investigate.      Early to bed and early to rise      Makes an owl healthy, and stealthy, and wise!\"        So he slept like an honest owl all day,      And rose in the early twilight gray,      And went to work in the dusky light      To look for the early worm at night.        He searched the country for miles around,      But the early worm was not to be found;      So he went to bed in the dawning light      And looked for the \"worm\" again next night.      And again and again, and again and again,      He sought and he sought, but all in vain,      Till he must have looked for a year and a day      For the early worm in the twilight gray.        At last in despair he gave up the search,      And was heard to remark as he sat on his perch      By the side of his nest in the hollow tree:      \"The thing is as plain as night to me--      Nothing can shake my conviction firm.      There's no such thing as the early worm.\"                                   --O. HERFORD.           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  FOX SPARROW.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1898, Chicago.]    THE FOX-COLORED SPARROW.      In \"Wood Notes Wild,\" S. P. Cheney says this song-loving Sparrow has a  sweet voice and a pleasing song, which he has set to music. No Sparrow,  he says, sings with a better quality of tone. A distinguished musician  himself, no one was better qualified to give a final opinion upon the  subject. Others have spoken in praise of it, Burroughs characterizing it  as \"a strong, richly modulated whistle, the finest Sparrow note I have  ever heard.\" Baird says, \"in the spring the male becomes quite musical,  and is one of our sweetest and most remarkable singers. His voice is  loud, clear, and melodious; his notes full, rich, and varied; and his  song is unequalled by any of this family that I have ever heard.\" Mr.  Torrey finds a \"Thrush-like\" quality in the song of the Fox Sparrow. In  his \"Birds in the Bush\" Mr. Torrey describes an interesting contest as  follows:    \"One afternoon I stood still while a Fox Sparrow and a Song Sparrow sang  alternately on either side of me, both exceptionally good vocalists, and  each doing his best. The songs were of about equal length, and as far as  theme was concerned were not a little alike; but the Fox Sparrow's tone  was both louder and more mellow than the others, while his notes were  longer,--more sustained,--and his voice was 'carried' from one pitch to  another. On the whole, I had no hesitation about giving him the palm;  but I am bound to say that his rival was a worthy competitor.\"    The Fox-colored Sparrow is also one of the largest and finest of his  tribe, breeding from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Labrador north into  Alaska; in winter it is met with south over the whole of the eastern  United States to the Gulf coast. Audubon found it nesting in Labrador  from the middle of June to the 5th of July. Its nest has been found in  trees and on the ground in the Arctic regions, on the Yukon river in  July. According to many observers, the nests are, for the most part,  placed on the ground, usually concealed by the drooping branches of  evergreens. They are made of grass and moss, lined with fine grass and  feathers. Some nests are three or four inches in depth, strong, compact,  and handsome. The eggs are three or five, oval in form, of a clayey  greenish ground color, dotted with dull reddish brown and chocolate.  They vary in coloration.    In the early spring the Fox Sparrow is often seen associated with small  parties of Juncos, in damp thickets and roadside shrubbery; later,  according to Mr. Bicknell, it takes more to woodsides, foraging on  leaf-strewn slopes where there is little or no undergrowth. In the  autumn it is found in hedgerows, thickets and weedy grainfields, rarely  however, straying far from some thickety cover. It is a great scratcher  among dead leaves, and \"can make the wood rubbish fly in a way which, in  proportion to its size, a barn-yard fowl could scarcely excel.\"    The Sparrows are worthy of close study, many of them possessing habits  of great beauty and interest.          BOB WHITE!      I'm a game bird, not a song bird with beautiful feathers, flitting all  day from tree to tree, but just a plain-looking little body, dressed in  sober colors, like a Quaker.    It wouldn't do for me to wear a red hat, and a green coat, and a yellow  vest. Oh, no!, that would be very foolish of me, indeed. What a mark I  would be for every man and boy who can fire a gun or throw a stone, as  I run along the ground in clearings and cultivated fields. That's the  reason I wear so plain a coat. At the first glance you would take me for  a bunch of dried grass or a bit of earth, but at the first movement, off  I go, running for dear life to some thickly wooded cover, where I hide  till danger is passed.    Cute! Yes, I think so. You would have to be sharp, too, if you were a  game bird. Through the summer we don't have much trouble, but just as  soon as cold weather sets in, and our broods have grown to an eatable  size, \"pop\" go the guns, and \"whirr\" go our wings as we fly through the  air. It is only at such times we take wing, sometimes seeking refuge in  a tree from our enemies. I'm sorry we are such nice birds--to eat--for  really we like to stay around farmhouses, and barn-yards, eating with  the chickens and other fowl. We are easily tamed, and the farmers often  thank us for the injurious insects we eat, and the seeds of weeds.    How do we know they thank us? Why, we must know that, when they scatter  seed for us on the snow. Kind deeds speak louder than words, for in the  winter we suffer a great deal. Sometimes when it is very cold we burrow  down under the snow, in snow-houses, as it were, to keep warm. That is  risky, though; for when it rains and then freezes over, we are in a  trap. A great many Quail die in this way during a hard winter.    Is Quail another name for Bob White? Yes, but people like Bob White  better. Did you ever hear me whistle? If not, come out in the country in  the spring, and hear me call to my mate. I sit on a fence rail, and, to  let her know where I am, I whistle, _Bob White! Bob White!_ and if she  pretends to be bashful, and doesn't answer me at once, I whistle again,  _Bob, Bob White!_ POOR _Bob White!_ She takes pity on me then, and comes  at my call.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  BOB WHITE.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1898, Chicago.]    BOB WHITE.      Bob White is a plump, fine-looking fellow, known in the New England  and Middle States as the Quail and in the Southern States as the  Partridge. It is said, however, that these names belong to other and  quite different birds, and at the suggestion of Prof. Baird, Bob White,  which is its call note, has become its accepted and present name. In  the language of Mr. N. S. Goss these birds appear to thrive best in the  presence of man, and were they protected during our cold winters, would  soon become quite tame. They often nest near our dwellings. \"In the  spring of 1867,\" says Mr. Goss, \"I was shown on Owl Creek, Woodson  County, Kansas, a nest containing nineteen eggs. It was placed in the  dooryard, and not over twenty-five yards from the house; several dogs  were running about the yard, and the house cat was purring near the  doorway. Fearing the eggs would be destroyed, I suggested the building  of a high, tight fence round the nest. 'Oh,' said the farmer, 'that is  not necessary; our cats and dogs will not harm them, for they know them  well, as they have for a long time run about with the chickens, and feed  with them from food thrown from the doorstep.' I am confident that if  man were as friendly to the birds as they are "]]]
