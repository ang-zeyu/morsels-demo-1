A forked stick was used to hold  down her head (Kolenosky and Johnston 1967), and she offered no  resistance (fig. 8). Evidently she went into shock or some other  psychophysiological state of unconsciousness, for after her release she  remained on her side and did not move for 1.5 hours, despite our  prodding during the first few minutes (fig. 9). Then suddenly she  leaped up and ran off.    [Illustration: _Figure 8.--Once pinned by the forked stick, the wolf  ceased struggling.

Mech.)_]    Each wolf was examined, outfitted with a radio transmitter collar 15  inches inside circumference (fig. 10) and tagged with identification  numbers in both ears (fig. 11). Each transmitter was of a different  frequency in the 150 MH_z range, emitted a pulsed signal ranging from  75 to 350 pulses per minute, and had a calculated life of at least 300  days (fig. 12). Two types of 12-inch whip antennas were used on the  transmitters: one type extended up the side of the collar and then  stuck out above for 6 inches; the other was fully attached inside the  collar and extended up one side, around the top, and partly down the  other side. The transmitter, batteries, and antenna were molded into a  collar of acrylic weighing 11 ounces (Mech _et al._ 1965).[2] All radio  equipment functioned flawlessly for at least 5 months, and one  transmitter continued operating for at least 9 months.    [Illustration: _Figure 10.--A radio transmitter collar was placed  around the neck of each trapped wolf. (Photo courtesy of D. L.  Breneman.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 11.--Each ear of the wolf was tagged with  identifying numbers. (Photo courtesy of Richard Bend.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 12.--Each radio collar had a different frequency  tuned to special receivers, which allowed each wolf to be identified.  (Photo courtesy of D. L. Breneman.)_]    For tracking radio-equipped wolves, a directional yagi antenna (fig.  13) was attached to each of the wing struts of an aircraft and  connected inside to a portable receiver. The usual tracking technique  was to fly at 1,500 to 3,000 feet elevation to the last known location  of the wolf being sought (fig. 14). If a signal was not obtained at  that point, the aircraft spiraled upward until the signal was found or  until 10,000 feet altitude had been reached. If the signal still was  not heard, a search pattern was flown at 10,000 feet. The range of the  signal from this altitude was 15 to 35 miles; at 3,000 feet it was 10  to 15 miles. Collars with antennas molded fully inside gave only about  two-thirds the range of those protruding partly, but could be expected  to last longer because the antennas could not break off. It is unknown  whether any protruding antennas did break during the study, but on  January 5, 1970, one wolf was recaptured, and its antenna had broken.    [Illustration: _Figure 13.--Directional yagi antennas fastened to the  wing struts of the aircraft were necessary to \"home in\" on the wolves.  (Photo courtesy of U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 14.--The tracking aircraft was usually flown at  altitudes of 1,500 to 3,000 feet.  (Photo courtesy of Dick Shank.)_]    When a signal was received, the aircraft was headed in the approximate  direction of the source until the signal strength reached a peak; a 90 deg.  turn was then made in the direction the signal seemed the strongest. A  series of these maneuvers soon narrowed the area to the point where  visual search was possible. After practice and experience with this  technique, we could locate the approximate source of the signal within  10 to 30 minutes after first receiving it.    Even though the radiotagged wolves spent most of their time inland,  often in stands of conifers, they were frequently observed from the  aircraft. The technique was to circle at 300 to 800 feet altitude  around a radius of a quarter mile from the point where the strongest  signal emanated. From December through April, 65 percent of the wolves  located by radio were sighted; the rate was much higher for more  experienced personnel. A pack of five wolves that was tracked was seen  31 times out of 33 attempts during February and March.    Whenever wolves were located, radiotagged or not, observations were  made from an altitude that did not disturb them. Packs varied in the  concern shown the aircraft, but only one or two ran from it. The  radiotagged wolves, and a pack of 10 to 13 animals, were habituated to  the aircraft and usually could be observed from altitudes of 500 feet  and less without disturbance (fig. 15).    Almost all the radiotracking was done from aircraft, but when inclement  weather prevented flying, some attempts from the ground succeeded when  wolves were close enough to roads. The usual range on the ground was  0.75 to 1.50 miles. One wolf was approached to within 35 feet through  radiotracking.    [Illustration: _Figure 15.--The wolves studied soon became accustomed  to the aircraft and could then be observed during their natural  activity. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] _Mention of trade names does not constitute endorsement by the USDA  Forest Service._    [2] _The acrylic collar was fashioned by the Davidson Co., Minneapolis,  Minnesota, which also produced some of the transmitters. Other  transmitters and two radio receivers were manufactured by the AVM  Instrument Co., Champaign, Illinois._      RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS    Aerial observations made during this study involved 490 hours  distributed as follows: January, February, March 1967--124 hours;  February 1968--10 hours; December 1968 through August 1969--356 hours.  Seventy-seven observations involving a total of 323 wolves were made  (table 1), excluding animals located through radiotracking.    One male and four female wolves were radiotagged, and they and their  associates were followed intermittently for periods of 5 to 8 months  (table 2). All except one initially suffered some injury to a foot.  Three of these animals were seen limping, but only in one case was the  limp judged extreme enough to have significantly affected the movements  or behavior of the animal. In that one case, the wolf (No. 1057) was  caught in a steel trap on an extremely cold night, and her foot froze.  After that she was often seen hopping on three legs. She was not able  to keep up with her pack, which consisted of 10 to 13 members, and her  movements were much restricted compared with those of other wolves.  However, she was frequently observed feeding on fresh kills, and may  even have made them herself.      _Table 1.--Sizes of wolf population units observed in northeastern  Minnesota_    #: _Number_  %: _Percent_    +------------------+-------------------------------------------+  |                  |             Wolf observations             |  |Population unit[3]+----------+----------+----------+----------+  |(number of wolves)|   Winter |   Winter |   Total  |Winters[4]|  |                  |  1966-67 |  1968-69 |          | 1948-53  |  +------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+  |                     #    %     #    %     #    %     #    %  |  |       1             8   31    17   33    25   32    48   43  |  |       2             3   12     6   12     9   12    24   22  |  |       3             3   12     2    4     5    6     7    6  |  |       4            --   --     7   14     7    9     7    6  |  |       5             2    7     4    8     6    8     8    7  |  |       6             3   12     4    8     7    9     7    6  |  |       7             2    7     1    2     3    4     4    4  |  |       8             3   12     3    6     6    8     3    3  |  |       9            --   --     2    4     2    3     3    3  |  |      10             2    7     2    4     4    5    --   --  |  |      11            --   --    --   --    --   --    --   --  |  |      12            --   --     1    2     1    1     1    1  |  |      13            --   --     2    4     2    3    --   --  |  |                  --------------------------------------------+  |Total number                                                  |  |  of wolves        109   --   214   --   323   --   318   --  |  |Total number                                                  |  |  of observations   26   --    51   --    77   --   112   --  |  |Mean population                                               |  |  unit size          4.2 --     4.2 --     4.2 --     2.8 --  |  +--------------------------------------------------------------+    FOOTNOTES:    [3] Because wolf packs sometimes split temporarily, these figures may  not strictly represent actual pack sizes; nevertheless they should  provide reasonably accurate approximations.

There was no  sign of any money. He looked crestfallen. Nevertheless, hoping to  comfort his good wife--    \"What are you worrying about?\" says he. \"Have we not in the bin that  cake we offered Katheline yesterday? And don't I see a great piece of  meat over there that should make good milk for the child for three  days at the least? And this tub of butter, is it a ghost-tub? And  are they spectres, those apples ranged like flags and banners all  in battle order, row after row, in the storeroom? And is there no  promise of cool refreshment guarded safe in the paunch of our fine  old cask of cuyte de Bruges?\"    Soetkin said: \"When we take the child to be christened we shall have  to give two patards to the priest, and a florin for the feasting.\"    But at this moment Katheline returned, with a great bundle of herbs  in her arms.    \"For the child that is born with a caul,\" she cried. \"Angelica that  keeps men from luxury; fenel that preserves them from Satan....\"    \"Have you none of that herb,\" asked Claes, \"which is called florins?\"    \"No,\" said she.    \"Very well,\" he answered, \"I shall go and see if I cannot find any  growing in the canal.\"    And with that he went off, with his line and his fishing-net, knowing  that he would not be likely to meet any one, since it was yet an hour  before the oosterzon, which is, in the land of Flanders, six o'clock  in the morning.              III      Claes came to the Bruges canal, not far from the sea. There, having  baited his hook, he cast it into the water and let out the line. On  the opposite bank, a little boy was lying against a clump of earth,  fast asleep. The boy, who was not dressed like a peasant, woke up at  the noise that Claes was making, and began to run away, fearing no  doubt that it was the village constable come to dislodge him from his  bed and to hale him off as a vagabond to the steen. But he soon lost  his fear when he recognized Claes, and when Claes called out to him:    \"Would you like to earn a penny, my boy? Well then, drive the fish  over to my side!\"    At this proposal the little boy, who was somewhat stout for his years,  jumped into the water, and arming himself with a plume of long reeds,  he began to drive the fish towards Claes. When the fishing was over,  Claes drew up his line and his landing-net, and came over by the lock  gate towards where the youngster was standing.    \"Your name,\" said Claes, \"is Lamme by baptism, and Goedzak by nature,  because you are of a gentle disposition, and you dwell in the rue  Heron behind the Church of Our Lady. But tell me why it is that,  young as you are, and well dressed, you are yet obliged to sleep out  here in the open?\"    \"Woe is me, Mr. Charcoal-burner,\" answered the boy. \"I have a sister  at home, a year younger than I am, who fairly thrashes me at the  least occasion of disagreement. But I dare not take my revenge upon  her back for fear of doing her some injury, sir. Last night at supper  I was very hungry, and I was clearing out with my fingers the bottom  of a dish of beef and beans. She wanted to share it, but there was  not enough for us both, sir. And when she saw me licking my lips  because the sauce smelt good, she went mad with rage, and smote me  with all her force, so hard indeed that I fled away from the house,  beaten all black and blue.\"    Claes asked him what his father and mother were doing during this  scene.    \"My father hit me on one shoulder and my mother on the other, crying,  'Strike back at her, you coward!' but I, not wishing to strike a girl,  made my escape.\"    All at once, Lamme went pale all over and began to tremble in every  limb, and Claes saw a tall woman approaching, and by her side a young  girl, very thin and fierce of aspect.    \"Oh, oh!\" cried Lamme, holding on to Claes by his breeches, \"here  are my mother and my sister come to find me. Protect me, please,  Mr. Charcoal-burner!\"    \"Wait,\" said Claes. \"First of all let me give you this penny-farthing  as your wages, and now let us go and meet them without fear.\"    When the two women saw Lamme, they ran up and both began to belabour  him--the mother because of the fright he had given her, the sister  because it was her habit so to do. Lamme took refuge behind Claes,  and cried out:    \"I have earned a penny-farthing! I have earned a penny-farthing! Do  not beat me!\"    By this time, however, his mother had begun to embrace him, while the  girl was trying to force open his hands and to get at the money. But  Lamme shouted:    \"The money belongs to me. You shall not have it.\"    And he kept his fingers tightly closed. But Claes shook the girl  roughly by the ears, and said to her:    \"If you go on picking quarrels like this with your brother, he that is  as good and gentle as a lamb, I shall put you in a black charcoal-pit,  and then it won't be I any longer that will be shaking you by the ears,  but the red devil himself from hell, and he will pull you into pieces  with his great claws and his teeth that are like forks.\"    At these words the girl averted her eyes from Claes, nor did she go  near Lamme, but hid behind her mother's skirts, and when she got back  into the town, she went about crying everywhere:    \"The Charcoal-man has beaten me, and he keeps the devil in his cave.\"    Nevertheless she did not attack Lamme any more; but being the bigger  of the two, she made him work in her place, and the gentle simpleton  obeyed her right willingly.    Now Claes, on his way home, sold his catch to a farmer that often used  to buy fish from him. And when he was home again, he said to Soetkin:    \"Behold! Here's what I have found in the bellies of four pike, nine  carp, and a basketful of eels.\" And he threw on the table a couple  of florins and half a farthing.    \"Why don't you go fishing every day, my man?\" asked Soetkin.    \"For fear of becoming a fish myself, and being caught on the hook of  the village constable,\" he told her.              IV      Claes, the father of Ulenspiegel, was known in Damme by the name  of Kooldraeger, that is to say, the Charcoal-burner. Claes had a  black head of hair, bright eyes, and a skin the colour of his own  merchandise--save only on Sundays and Feast Days, when his cottage  ran with soap and water. He was a short, thick-set man, strong,  and of a joyful countenance.    Towards the end of the day, when evening was coming on, he would  sometimes visit the tavern on the road to Bruges, there to rinse his  charcoal-blackened throat with a draught of cuyte; and then the women  standing at their doorways to sniff the evening dew would cry out to  him in friendly greeting:    \"A good night and a good drink to you, Charcoal-burner.\"    \"A good night to you, and a lively husband!\" Claes would reply.    And sometimes the girls, trooping home together from their work in  the fields, would line up in front of him right across the road,  barring his way.    \"What will you give us for the right of passage?\" they would cry. \"A  scarlet ribbon, a buckle of gold, a pair of velvet slippers, or a  florin piece for alms?\"    But Claes, holding one of the girls fast by the waist, would give  her a hearty kiss on her fresh cheek or on her neck, just whichever  happened to be nearest, and then he would say:    \"You must ask the rest, my dears, of your sweethearts.\"    And off they would go amidst peals of laughter.    As for the children, they always recognized Claes by his loud voice  and by the noise his clogs made on the road, and they would run up  to him and cry:    \"Good evening, Charcoal-burner.\"    \"The same to you, my little angels,\" he would answer; \"but come no  nearer, lest perchance I turn you into blackamoors.\"    But the children were bold, and oftentimes would make the venture. Then  Claes would seize one of them by the doublet, and rubbing his blackened  hands up and down the little fellow's nose, would send him off all  sooty, but laughing just the same, to the huge delight of the others.    Soetkin, wife of Claes, was a good wife and mother. She was up with  the dawn, and worked as diligently as any ant. She and Claes laboured  together in the field, yoking themselves to the plough as though they  had been oxen. It was hard work dragging it along, but even the plough  was not so heavy as the harrow, that rustic implement whose task it  was to tear up the hardened earth with teeth of wood. But Claes and  his wife worked always with a gay heart, and enlivened themselves with  singing. And in vain was the earth hard, in vain did the sun hurl  down on them his hottest beams, in vain were their knees stiffened  with bending and their loins tired with the cruel effort of dragging  the harrow along, for they had only to stop a moment while Soetkin  turned to Claes her gentle face, and while Claes kissed that mirror  of a gentle heart, and straightway they forgot how tired they were.              V      Now the previous day, the town crier had given notice from before  the Town Hall that Madame, the wife of the Emperor Charles, being  near the time of her delivery, it behoved the people to say prayers  on her behalf.    Katheline came to Claes in a great state of excitement.    \"Whatever is the matter, my good woman?\" he asked.    \"Alas!\" she cried, catching her breath, \"behold! This night the  ghosts are mowing men down like grass. Little girls are being buried  alive. The executioner is dancing on the body of the dead. And broken,  this night, is that Stone which has been sweating blood these nine  months past and more!\"    \"Mercy on us!\" groaned Soetkin. \"Mercy on us, O Lord! This is a black  omen indeed for the land of Flanders.\"    \"Do you see these things with your own eyes wide awake, or perchance  in a dream?\" Claes asked her.    \"With my own eyes,\" Katheline told him. And then all pale and tearful,  she continued in these words:    \"To-night two children are born: the one in Spain--the infant  Philip--and the other in this land "]]]
