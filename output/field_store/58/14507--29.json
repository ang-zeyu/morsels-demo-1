These long-doubted references of      Duges to _Gopherus polyphemus_ seem clearly to represent _G.      flavomarginatus_, which probably occurs in several or all of the      internally drained basins in northeastern Chihuahua, western      Coahuila, and northern Durango. This region is within the Basin and      Range physiographic province of Fenneman (1931:326-8) and the      Mapimi biotic province of Smith (1949:231). Duges (_supra cit._)      seems to have used \"Bolson de Mapimi\" in a restricted sense, as it      is shown on some recent maps (Nat. Geog. Soc., Map of Mexico and      Central America, 1953) (American Geog. Soc., Culican Map, NG 13,      1935). Other maps show this bolson to include internally drained      portions of the Mexican highlands from northeastern Chihuahua to      the region near Lerdo and Torreon. Thayer (1916:73) pointed out      that the Bolson de Mapimi, in its larger sense, consists of a      series of basins separated by mountains of considerable elevation.        The range of _G. flavomarginatus_ appears to be limited ultimately      by the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the      Sierra Madre Oriental to the west and east, respectively, and to      the south by the Mexican plateau. The northern limits of the range      are less clear; possibly the range extends as far as the portions      of the United States adjacent to northeastern Chihuahua, but this      is doubtful. The range seems not to overlap that of any other      species of _Gopherus_, although the ranges of _G. flavomarginatus_      and _G. berlandieri_ closely approximate each other in central      Coahuila.        In September, 1958, when I was collecting turtles near Cuatro      Cienegas, Coahuila, I took the opportunity to query natives, as      well as an American rancher, about the possible occurrence of      tortoises in the area. Most persons had seen no tortoises in the      area or said they had seen them only rarely. Several older men who      had herded goats in the area all their lives said that tortoises      (referred to as \"Tortuga del Monte\") were common on the other side      of the Sierra de La Madera and Sierra de La Fragua ranges west of      Cuatro Cienegas. These men referred probably to _G.      flavomarginatus_. Americanos lies approximately 75 miles      west-northwest of Cuatro Cienegas.        It is indeed remarkable that a population of large tortoises in      northern Mexico has so long escaped the notice of naturalists. Also      remarkable is the fact that the late Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, in      view of his intense interest in North American chelonians and his      familiarity with the genus _Gopherus_, did not remark on the      specimens from Durango when he saw them; a thorough search of      Stejneger's notes revealed no clue that he had ever studied the      specimens. Perhaps his first reaction to the specimens, like mine      when I first examined the two disassociated skulls, was to consider      \"Lerdo\" a misspelling of \"Laredo.\" However, a check of old      correspondence and accession records at the National Museum      confirmed, beyond doubt, the validity of the locality data for      these specimens. Dr. Chaffee, the collector, frequently sent      specimens of plants and animals to the Museum from Durango and      Zacatecas; his home was in Lerdo.        _Size._--The largest specimen of _Gopherus flavomarginatus_ (USNM      61254) exceeds by more than 50 millimeters the length of the      largest known specimens of _G. agassizii_, and slightly exceeds the      length of the largest specimen of _G. polyphemus_ that I have      examined (USNM 51357, length of carapace 360 millimeters, a      specimen formerly kept at the National Zoological Park). _G.      polyphemus_ is the largest tortoise inhabiting the United States;      the maximum length of 343 millimeters given for the species by Carr      (1952:334) probably more closely approaches the true maximum in      free-living populations. _G. agassizii_ rarely attains a length      greater than 300 millimeters (Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:152-5). The      fact that representatives of the genus do not attain a larger size      in the United States may be due to the decimation of natural      populations by man for food and souvenirs.        There have been several indications that a large species of      tortoise existed in north-central Mexico. The Chihuahuan specimens      reported by Duges (248 and 202 millimeters long, respectively) rank      in size with the smaller paratypes of _G. flavomarginatus_; Duges      stated, however, that the species was said to attain a length of      one meter but that he thought such large size surely to apply to      another species.        Mr. Charles M. Bogert recently related to me two stories that are      here worthy of note. One of them, which Bogert learned from the      late Dr. Karl P. Schmidt, concerns a collector who was sent by the      Chicago Natural History Museum (then Field Museum) to Coahuila in      the early part of the century to obtain materials for a desert      exhibit. When the exhibit had been completed several decades later,      the collector, visiting the museum, inquired as to where the large      tortoises were that he had collected in Coahuila. Dr. Schmidt could      find no record of such tortoises and suggested that possibly they      had been confused with Galapagos tortoises (_Geochelone_). Dr.      Robert F. Inger is unable to locate the specimens or add anything      to the story. The collector stated that the large tortoises had      been found in only one bolson in Coahuila.        Mr. Bogert further related that, in 1946 when he was camped at Las      Delicias, Coahuila, a Mexican mule herder told him of seeing a      large tortoise \"three bolsons north\" of the bolson in which Las      Delicias is located (the general area referred to would be near      Americanos). The man awoke one morning to find his saddle missing;      following tracks from the place where the saddle had been left, the      man eventually found it on the back of a large tortoise. The      tortoise had apparently sought shelter beneath the saddle and,      finding it unsatisfactory, had walked away with the saddle on his      back.        Either of the incidents"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3284"],[0,"The Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#2)"],[1,"the same as  that which has constituted it the great focus of water or lake supply,  whence issue the principal rivers of Africa. On the equator lie the  rainbearing influences of the Mountains of the Moon. The equatorial line  is, in fact, the centre of atmospheric motion.          Fauna    In treating of this branch of natural history, we will first take  man--the true curly-head, flab-nosed, pouch-mouthed negro--not the  Wahuma. [2] They are well distributed all over these latitudes, but are  not found anywhere in dense communities. Their system of government is  mostly of the patriarchal character. Some are pastorals, but most are  agriculturalists; and this difference, I believe, originates solely from  want of a stable government, to enable them to reap what they produce;  for where the negro can save his cattle, which is his wealth, by eating  grain, he will do it. In the same way as all animals, whether wild or  tame, require a guide to lead their flocks, so do the negroes find it  necessary to have chiefs over their villages and little communities,  who are their referees on all domestic or political questions. They have  both their district and their village chiefs, but, in the countries we  are about to travel over, no kings such as we shall find that the Wahuma  have. The district chief is absolute, though guided in great measure by  his \"grey-beards,\" who constantly attend his residence, and talk over  their affairs of state. These commonly concern petty internal matters;  for they are too selfish and too narrow-minded to care for anything but  their own private concerns. The grey-beards circulate the orders of the  chief amongst the village chiefs, who are fined when they do not comply  with them; and hence all orders are pretty well obeyed.    One thing only tends to disorganise the country, and that is war,  caused, in the first instance, by polygamy, producing a family of  half-brothers, who, all aspiring to succeed their father, fight  continually with one another, and make their chief aim slaves and  cattle; whilst, in the second instance, slavery keeps them ever fighting  and reducing their numbers. The government revenues are levied, on  a very small scale, exclusively for the benefit of the chief and his  grey-beards. For instance, as a sort of land-tax, the chief has a right  to drink free from the village brews of pombe (a kind of beer made by  fermentation), which are made in turn by all the villagers successively.  In case of an elephant being killed, he also takes a share of the meat,  and claims one of its tusks as his right; further, all leopard, lion, or  zebra skins are his by right. On merchandise brought into the country by  traders, he has a general right to make any exactions he thinks he has  the power of enforcing, without any regard to justice or a regulated  tariff. This right is called Hongo, in the plural Mahongo. Another  source of revenue is in the effects of all people condemned for sorcery,  who are either burnt, or speared and cast into the jungles, and their  property seized by the grey-beards for their chief.    As to punishments, all irreclaimable thieves or murderers are killed  and disposed of in the same manner as these sorcerers; whilst on minor  thieves a penalty equivalent to the extent of the depredation is levied.  Illicit intercourse being treated as petty larceny, a value is fixed  according to the value of the woman--for it must be remembered all  women are property. Indeed, marriages are considered a very profitable  speculation, the girl's hand being in the father's gift, who marries  her to any one who will pay her price. This arrangement, however, is not  considered a simple matter of buying and selling, but delights in the  high-sounding title of \"dowry.\" Slaves, cows, goats, fowls, brass wire,  or beads, are the usual things given for this species of dowry. The  marriage-knot, however, is never irretrievably tied; for if the wife  finds a defect in her husband, she can return to her father by refunding  the dowry; whilst the husband, if he objects to his wife, can claim  half-price on sending her home again, which is considered fair, because  as a second-hand article her future value would be diminished by half.  By this system, it must be observed, polygamy is a source of wealth,  since a man's means are measured by the number of his progeny; but it  has other advantages besides the dowry, for the women work more than the  men do, both in and out of doors; and, in addition to the females, the  sons work for the household until they marry, and in after life take  care of their parents in the same way as in the first instance the  parents took care of them.    Twins are usually hailed with delight, because they swell the power of  the family, though in some instances they are put to death. Albinos are  valued, though their colour is not admired. If death occurs in a natural  manner, the body is usually either buried in the village or outside. A  large portion of the negro races affect nudity, despising clothing as  effeminate; but these are chiefly the more boisterous roving pastorals,  who are too lazy either to grow cotton or strip the trees of their bark.  Their young women go naked; but the mothers suspend a little tail both  before and behind. As the hair of the negro will not grow long, a barber  might be dispensed with, were it not that they delight in odd fashions,  and are therefore continually either shaving it off altogether, or else  fashioning it after the most whimsical designs. No people in the world  are so proud and headstrong as the negroes, whether they be pastoral or  agriculturalists. With them, as with the rest of the world, \"familiarity  breeds contempt\"; hospitality lives only one day; for though proud of a  rich or white visitor--and they implore him to stop, that they may keep  feeding their eyes on his curiosities--they seldom give more than a cow  or a goat, though professing to supply a whole camp with provisions.    Taking the negroes as a whole, one does not find very marked or much  difference in them. Each tribe has its characteristics, it is true. For  instance, one cuts his teeth or tattoos his face in a different manner  from the others; but by the constant intermarriage with slaves, much  of this effect is lost, and it is further lost sight of owing to the  prevalence of migrations caused by wars and the division of governments.  As with the tribal marks so with their weapons; those most commonly in  use are the spear, assage, shield, bow and arrow. It is true some affect  one, some the other; but in no way do we see that the courage of tribes  can be determined by the use of any particular weapon: for the bravest  use the arrow, which is the more dreaded; while the weakest confine  themselves to the spear. Lines of traffic are the worst tracks (there  are no roads in the districts here referred to) for a traveller to go  upon, not only because the hospitality of the people has been damped  by frequent communication with travellers, but, by intercourse with the  semi-civilised merchant, their natural honour and honesty are corrupted,  their cupidity is increased, and the show of firearms ceases to frighten  them.    Of paramount consideration is the power held by the magician (Mganga),  who rules the minds of the kings as did the old popes of Europe. They,  indeed, are a curse to the traveller; for if it suits their inclinations  to keep him out of the country, they have merely to prognosticate all  sorts of calamities--as droughts, famines, or wars--in the event of his  setting eyes on the soil, and the chiefs, people, and all, would believe  them; for, as may be imagined, with men unenlightened, supernatural and  imaginary predictions work with more force than substantial reasons.  Their implement of divination, simple as it may appear, is a cow's  or antelope's horn (Uganga), which they stuff with magic powder, also  called Uganga. Stuck into the ground in front of the village, it is  supposed to have sufficient power to ward off the attacks of an enemy.    By simply holding it in the hand, the magician pretends he can discover  anything that has been stolen or lost; and instances have been told of  its dragging four men after it with irresistible impetus up to a thief,  when it be-laboured the culprit and drove him out of his senses. So  imbued are the natives' minds with belief in the power of charms, that  they pay the magician for sticks, stones, or mud, which he has doctored  for them. They believe certain flowers held in the hand will conduct  them to anything lost; as also that the voice of certain wild animals,  birds, or beasts, will insure them good-luck, or warn them of danger.  With the utmost complacency our sable brother builds a dwarf hut in his  fields, and places some grain on it to propitiate the evil spirit, and  suffer him to reap the fruits of his labour, and this too they call  Uganga or church.    These are a few of the more innocent alternatives the poor negroes  resort to in place of a \"Saviour.\" They have also many other and more  horrible devices. For instance, in times of tribulation, the magician,  if he ascertains a war is projected by inspecting the blood and bones  of a fowl which he has flayed for that purpose, flays a young child,  and having laid it lengthwise on a path, directs all the warriors, on  proceeding to battle, to step over his sacrifice and insure themselves  victory. Another of these extra barbarous devices takes place when a  chief wishes to make war on his neighbour by his calling in a magician  to discover a propitious time for commencing. The doctor places a large  earthen vessel, half full of water, over a fire, and over its mouth  a grating of sticks, whereon he lays a small child and a fowl side by  side, and covers them over with a second large earthen vessel, just like  the first, only inverted, to keep the steam in, when he sets fire below,"]]]
