It lay gleaming in the snow at his feet, and the alien  memories were gone--and Camar was dead.    After a time he crouched down, breathing harshly. He did not want to  touch the lens again. The part of him that had learned to fear strange  gods and evil spirits with every step he took, the primitive aboriginal  that lay so close under the surface of his mind, warned him to leave it,  to run away, to desert this place of death and ruined stone.    He forced himself to take it up. He did not look at it. He wrapped it in  the bit of silk and replaced it inside the iron boss, and clasped the  belt around his waist. Then he found the small flask that lay with his  gear beside the fire and took a long pull, and tried to think rationally  of the thing that had happened.    Memories. Not his own, but the memories of Ban Cruach, a million years  ago in the morning of a world. Memories of hate, a secret war against  unhuman beings that dwelt in crystal cities cut in the living ice, and  used these ruined towers for some dark purpose of their own.    Was that the meaning of the talisman, the power that lay within it? Had  Ban Cruach, by some elder and forgotten science, imprisoned the echoes  of his own mind in the crystal?    Why? Perhaps as a warning, as a reminder of ageless, alien danger beyond  the Gates of Death?    Suddenly one of the beasts tethered outside the ruined tower started up  from its sleep with a hissing snarl.    Instantly Stark became motionless.    They came silently on their padded feet, the rangy mountain brutes  moving daintily through the sprawling ruin. Their riders too were  silent--tall men with fierce eyes and russet hair, wearing leather coats  and carrying each a long, straight spear.    There were a score of them around the tower in the windy gloom. Stark  did not bother to draw his gun. He had learned very young the difference  between courage and idiocy.    He walked out toward them, slowly lest one of them be startled into  spearing him, yet not slowly enough to denote fear. And he held up his  right hand and gave them greeting.    They did not answer him. They sat their restive mounts and stared at  him, and Stark knew that Camar had spoken the truth. These were the  riders of Mekh, and they were wolves.          II      Stark waited, until they should tire of their own silence.    Finally one demanded, \"Of what country are you?\"    He answered, \"I am called N'Chaka, the Man-Without-a-Tribe.\"    It was the name they had given him, the half-human aboriginals who had  raised him in the blaze and thunder and bitter frosts of Mercury.    \"A stranger,\" said the leader, and smiled. He pointed at the dead Camar  and asked, \"Did you slay him?\"    \"He was my friend,\" said Stark, \"I was bringing him home to die.\"    Two riders dismounted to inspect the body. One called up to the leader,  \"He was from Kushat, if I know the breed, Thord! And he has not been  robbed.\" He proceeded to take care of that detail himself.    \"A stranger,\" repeated the leader, Thord. \"Bound for Kushat, with a man  of Kushat. Well. I think you will come with us, stranger.\"    Stark shrugged. And with the long spears pricking him, he did not resist  when the tall Thord plundered him of all he owned except his  clothes--and Camar's belt, which was not worth the stealing. His gun  Thord flung contemptuously away.    One of the men brought Stark's beast and Camar's from where they were  tethered, and the Earthman mounted--as usual, over the violent protest  of the creature, which did not like the smell of him. They moved out  from under the shelter of the walls, into the full fury of the wind.    For the rest of that night, and through the next day and the night that  followed it they rode eastward, stopping only to rest the beasts and  chew on their rations of jerked meat.    To Stark, riding a prisoner, it came with full force that this was the  North country, half a world away from the Mars of spaceships and  commerce and visitors from other planets. The future had never touched  these wild mountains and barren plains. The past held pride enough.    To the north, the horizon showed a strange and ghostly glimmer where the  barrier wall of the polar pack reared up, gigantic against the sky. The  wind blew, down from the ice, through the mountain gorges, across the  plains, never ceasing. And here and there the cryptic towers rose,  broken monoliths of stone. Stark remembered the vision of the talisman,  the huge structure crowned with eerie darkness. He looked upon the ruins  with loathing and curiosity. The men of Mekh could tell him nothing.    Thord did not tell Stark where they were taking him, and Stark did not  ask. It would have been an admission of fear.    In mid-afternoon of the second day they came to a lip of rock where the  snow was swept clean, and below it was a sheer drop into a narrow  valley. Looking down, Stark saw that on the floor of the valley, up and  down as far as he could see, were men and beasts and shelters of hide  and brush, and fires burning. By the hundreds, by the several thousand,  they camped under the cliffs, and their voices rose up on the thin air  in a vast deep murmur that was deafening after the silence of the  plains.    A war party, gathered now, before the thaw. Stark smiled. He became  curious to meet the leader of this army.    They found their way single file along a winding track that dropped down  the cliff face. The wind stopped abruptly, cut off by the valley walls.  They came in among the shelters of the camp.    Here the snow was churned and soiled and melted to slush by the fires.  There were no women in the camp, no sign of the usual cheerful rabble  that follows a barbarian army. There were only men--hillmen and warriors  all, tough-handed killers with no thought but battle.    They came out of their holes to shout at Thord and his men, and stare at  the stranger. Thord was flushed and jovial with importance.    \"I have no time for you,\" he shouted back. \"I go to speak with the Lord  Ciaran.\"    Stark rode impassively, a dark giant with a face of stone. From time to  time he made his beast curvet, and laughed at himself inwardly for doing  it.    They came at length to a shelter larger than the others, but built  exactly the same and no more comfortable. A spear was thrust into the  snow beside the entrance, and from it hung a black pennant with a single  bar of silver across it, like lightning in a night sky. Beside it was a  shield with the same device. There were no guards.    Thord dismounted, bidding Stark to do the same. He hammered on the  shield with the hilt of his sword, announcing himself.    \"Lord Ciaran! It is Thord--with a captive.\"    A voice, toneless and strangely muffled, spoke from within.    \"Enter, Thord.\"    Thord pushed aside the hide curtain and went in, with Stark at his  heels.           *       *       *       *       *    The dim daylight did not penetrate the interior. Cressets burned, giving  off a flickering brilliance and a smell of strong oil. The floor of  packed snow was carpeted with furs, much worn. Otherwise there was no  adornment, and no furniture but a chair and a table, both dark with age  and use, and a pallet of skins in one shadowy corner with what seemed to  be a heap of rags upon it.    In the chair sat a man.    He seemed very tall, in the shaking light of the cressets. From neck to  thigh his lean body was cased in black link mail, and under that a tunic  of leather, dyed black. Across his knees he held a sable axe, a great  thing made for the shearing of skulls, and his hands lay upon it gently,  as though it were a toy he loved.    His head and face were covered by a thing that Stark had seen before  only in very old paintings--the ancient war-mask of the inland Kings of  Mars. Wrought of black and gleaming steel, it presented an unhuman  visage of slitted eyeholes and a barred slot for breathing. Behind, it  sprang out in a thin, soaring sweep, like a dark wing edge-on in flight.    The intent, expressionless scrutiny of that mask was bent, not upon  Thord, but upon Eric John Stark.    The hollow voice spoke again, from behind the mask. \"Well?\"    \"We were hunting in the gorges to the south,\" said Thord. \"We saw a  fire....\" He told the story, of how they had found the stranger and the  body of the man from Kushat.    \"Kushat!\" said the Lord Ciaran softly. \"Ah! And why, stranger, were you  going to Kushat?\"    \"My name is Stark. Eric John Stark, Earthman, out of Mercury.\" He was  tired of being called stranger. Quite suddenly, he was tired of the  whole business.    \"Why should I not go to Kushat? Is it against some law, that a man may  not go there in peace without being hounded all over the Norlands? And  why do the men of Mekh make it their business? They have nothing to do  with the city.\"    Thord held his breath, watching with delighted anticipation.    The hands of the man in armor caressed the axe. They were slender hands,  smooth and sinewy--small hands, it seemed, for such a weapon.    \"We make what we will our business, Eric John Stark.\" He spoke with a  peculiar gentleness. \"I have asked you. Why were you going to Kushat?\"    \"Because,\" Stark answered with equal restraint, \"my comrade wanted to go  home to die.\"    \"It seems a long, hard journey, just for dying.\" The black helm bent  forward, in an attitude of thought. \"Only the condemned or banished  leave their cities, or their clans. Why did your comrade flee Kushat?\"    A voice spoke suddenly from out of the heap of rags that lay on the  pallet in the shadows of the corner. A man's voice, deep and husky, with  the harsh quaver of age or madness in it.    \"Three men beside myself have fled Kushat, over the years that matter.  One died in the spring floods. One was caught in the moving ice of  winter. One lived.

This method of embroidery  permitted for the first time the use of a continuous length of thread.  At this time the chainstitch was used exclusively for decorative  embroidery, and from the French name for drum--the shape of the frame  that held the fabric--the worked fabric came to be called tambour  embroidery. The crochet[4] or small hooked needle soon became known as  a tambour needle.    In 1755 a new type of needle was invented for producing embroidery  stitches. This needle had to pass completely through the fabric two  times (a through-and-through motion) for every stitch. The inventor was  Charles F. Weisenthal, a German mechanic living in London who was  granted British patent 701 for a two-pointed needle (fig. 4). The  invention was described in the patent as follows:         The muslin, being put into a frame, is to be worked with a needle       that has two points, one at the head, and the other point as a       common needle, which is to be worked by holding it with the fingers       in the middle, so as not to require turning.    It might be argued that Weisenthal had invented the eye-pointed needle,  since he was the first inventor to put a point at the end of the needle  having the eye. But, since his specifically stated use required the  needle to have two points and to be passed completely through the  fabric, Weisenthal had no intention of utilizing the very important  advantage that the eye-pointed needle provided, that of _not_ requiring  the passage of the needle through the fabric as in hand sewing.    While no records can be found to establish that Weisenthal's patent was  put to any commercial use during the inventor's lifetime, the  two-pointed needle with eye at midpoint appeared in several 19th-century  sewing-machine inventions.    The earliest of the known mechanical sewing devices produced a chain or  tambour stitch, but by an entirely different principle than that used  with either needle just described. Although the idea was incorporated  into a patent, the machine was entirely overlooked for almost a century  as the patent itself was classed under wearing apparel. It was entitled  \"An Entire New Method of Making and Completing Shoes, Boots,  Splatterdashes, Clogs, and Other Articles, by Means of Tools and  Machines also Invented by Me for that Purpose, and of Certain  Compositions of the Nature of Japan or Varnish, which will be very  advantageous in many useful Applications.\" This portentously titled  British patent 1,764 was issued to an English cabinetmaker, Thomas  Saint, on July 17, 1790. Along with accounts of several processes for  making various varnish compositions, the patent contains descriptions of  three separate machines; the second of these was for \"stitching,  quilting, or sewing.\" Though far from practical, the machine  incorporated several features common to a modern sewing machine. It had  a horizontal cloth plate or table, an overhanging arm carrying a  straight needle, and a continuous supply of thread from a spool. The  motion was derived from the rotation of a hand crank on a shaft, which  activated cams that produced all the actions of the machine.    [Illustration: Figure 2.--PRIMITIVE NEEDLE. Bronze. Egyptian (Roman  period, 30 B.C.-A.D. 642). (Smithsonian photo 1379-A.)]    One cam operated the forked needle (fig. 5) that pushed the thread  through a hole made by a preceding thrust of the awl. The thread was  caught by a looper and detained so that it then became enchained in the  next loop of thread. The patent described thread tighteners above and  below the work and an adjustment to vary the stitches for different  kinds of material. Other than the British patent records, no  contemporary reference to Saint's machine has ever been found. The  stitching-machine contents of this patent was happened on by accident in  1873.[5] Using the patent description, a Newton Wilson of London  attempted to build a model of Saint's machine in 1874.[6] Wilson found,  however, that it was necessary to modify the construction before the  machine would stitch at all.    [Illustration: Figure 3.--TAMBOUR NEEDLE AND FRAME, showing the method  of forming the chainstitch, from the Diderot Encyclopedia of 1763, vol.  II, _Plates Brodeur_, plate II. (Smithsonian photo 43995-C.)]    This raised the question whether Saint had built even one machine.  Nevertheless, the germ of an idea was there, and had the inventor  followed through the sewing machine might have been classed an  18th-century rather than a 19th-century contribution.      1800-1820    There is no doubt that the successful late-18th-century improvements in  spinning and weaving methods, resulting in increased production of  fabrics, had a great effect in spurring inventors to ideas of stitching  by machinery. Several efforts were made during the first two decades of  the 19th century to produce such machines.    On February 14, 1804, a French patent was issued to Thomas Stone and  James Henderson for a \"new mechanical principle designed to replace  handwork in joining the edges of all kinds of flexible material, and  particularly applicable to the manufacture of clothing.\"[7] The machine  used a common needle and made an overcast stitch in the same manner as  hand sewing. A pair of jaws or pincers, imitating the action of the  fingers, alternately seized and released the needle on each side of the  fabric. The pincers were attached to a pair of arms arranged to be moved  backward and forward by \"any suitable mechanism.\"[8] This machine was  capable of making curved or angular as well as straight seams, but it  was limited to carrying a short length of thread, necessitating frequent  rethreading. The machine may have had some limited use, but it was not  commercially successful.    On May 30 of the same year John Duncan, a Glasgow manufacturer, was  granted British patent 2,769 for \"a new and improved method of  tambouring, or raising flowers, figures or other ornaments upon muslins,  lawns and other cottons, cloths, or stuffs.\" This machine made the  chainstitch, using not one but many hooked needles that operated  simultaneously. The needles, attached to a bar or carrier, were pushed  through the vertically held fabric from the upper right side, which in  this case was also the outer side. After passing through it, they were  supplied with thread from spools by means of peculiarly formed hooks or  thread carriers. The thread was twisted around the needle above the  hook, so as to be caught by it, and drawn through to the outer surface.  The shaft of the needle was grooved on the hook side and fitted with a  slider. This slider closed upon the retraction of the needle from the  fabric, holding the thread in place and preventing the hook from  catching. The fabric was stretched between two rollers set in an upright  frame capable of sliding vertically in a second frame arranged to have  longitudinal motion. The combination of these two motions was sufficient  to produce any required design. The principle developed by Duncan was  used on embroidery machines, in a modified form, for many years. Of  several early attempts, his was the first to realize any form of  success.    [Illustration: Figure 4.--WEISENTHAL'S two-pointed needle, 1755.]    [Illustration: Figure 5.--SAINT'S SEWING MACHINE, 1790. (Smithsonian  photo 42490-A.)]    [Illustration: Figure 6.--CHAPMAN'S SEWING MACHINE, first eye-pointed  needle, 1807. (Smithsonian photo 33299-K.)]    A type of rope-stitching machine, which might be considered unimportant  to this study, must be included because of its use of the eye-pointed  needle, the needle that was to play a most important part in the later  development of a practical sewing machine. The earliest reference to the  use of a needle with an eye not being required to be passed completely  through the fabric it was stitching is found in a machine invented by  Edward Walter Chapman, for which he and William Chapman were granted  British patent 3,078 on October 30, 1807. The machine (fig. 6) was  designed to construct belting or flat banding by stitching together  several strands of rope that had been laid side by side. Two needles  were required and used alternately. One needle was threaded and then  forced through the ropes. On the opposite side the thread was removed  from the eye of the first needle before it was withdrawn. The second  needle was threaded and the operation repeated. The needles could also  be used to draw the thread, rather than push it, through the ropes with  the same result. While being stitched, the ropes were held fast and the  sewing frame and supporting carriage were moved manually as each stitch  was made. Such a machine would be applicable only to the work described,  since the necessity of rethreading at every stitch would make it  impractical for any other type of sewing.    Another early machine reported to have used the eye-pointed needle to  form the chainstitch was invented about 1810 by Balthasar Krems,[9] a  hosiery worker of Mayen, Germany. One knitted article produced there was  a peaked cap, and Krems' machine was devised to stitch the turned edges  of the cap,[10] which was suspended from wire pins on a moving wheel.  The needle of the machine was attached to a horizontal shaft and carried  the thread through the fabric. The loop of thread was retained by a  hook-shaped pin to become enchained with the next loop at the reentry of  the needle. Local history reports that this device may have been used as  early as 1800, but the inventor did not patent his machine and  apparently made no attempt to commercialize it. No contemporary  references to the machine could be found, and use of the machine may  have died with the inventor in 1813.    [Illustration: Figure 7.--MADERSPERGER'S 1814 SEWING MACHINE.
