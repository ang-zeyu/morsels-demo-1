When he  journeyed northwards to visit his parental house or to pay his respects  to Lord Sandwich's family at Hinchinbrooke, he usually found suitable  accommodation at \"Goody Gorums\" and \"Mother\" somebody else who lived  over against the \"Crown.\" Neither the famous posting-house the \"George\"  nor the \"Falcon\" are mentioned in the _Diary_, but he speaks of the  \"Chequers\"; however, the change of names of ancient hostelries is  common, so in picturing the susceptible Clerk of the Admiralty chucking  a pretty chambermaid under the chin in the old galleried yard of the  \"George,\" we may not be far out of our reckoning.    But altogether the old George Inn is somewhat disappointing. Its  balustraded galleries are there sure enough, with the queer old  staircase leading up to them in one of the corners; but it has the same  burnished-up appearance of the courtyard of the Leicester Hospital at  Warwick. How much more pleasing both would strike the eye were there  less paint and varnish. The Inn has been refronted, and from the street  has quite a modern appearance.    Huntingdon recalls the sterner name of Cromwell. Strange that this  county, so proud of the Lord Protector (for has it not recently set up a  gorgeous statue at St. Ives to his memory?), should still harbour  red-hot Jacobites! According to _The Legitimist Calendar_, mysterious  but harmless meetings are still held hereabouts on Oak Apple Day: a day  elsewhere all but forgotten. Huntingdon was the headquarters of the  Royalist army certainly upon many occasions, and when evil days fell  upon the \"Martyr King,\" some of his staunchest friends were here  secretly working for his welfare.[1] When Charles passed through the  town in 1644, the mayor, loyal to the back-bone, had prepared a speech  to outrival the flowery welcome of his fellow-magistrates: \"Although  Rome's Hens,\" he said, \"should daily hatch of its preposterous eggs,  chrocodilicall chickens, yet under the Shield of Faith, by you our most  Royal Sovereigne defended and by the King of Heavens as I stand and your  most medicable councell, would we not be fearful to withstand them.\"[2]  Though the sentence is somewhat involved, the worthy magnate doubtless  meant well.    It was the custom, by the way, so Evelyn tells us, when a monarch passed  through Huntingdon, to meet him with a hundred ploughs as a symbol of  the fruitful soil: the county indeed at one time was rich in vines and  hops, and has been described by old writers as the garden of England.  Still here as elsewhere the farmers' outlook is a poor one to-day,  although there are, of course, exceptions.    At historic Hinchinbrooke (on June 4, 1647), King Charles slept the  first night after he was removed from Holdenby House by Cornet Joyce:  the first stage of his _progress_ to the scaffold. In the grounds of the  old mansion, the monarch, when Prince of Wales, and little Oliver played  together, for the owner in those days of the ancient seat of the  Montagues and Cromwells was the future Protector's uncle and godfather.  Upon one occasion the boys had a stand-up fight, and the commoner, the  senior by only one year, made his royal adversary's nose bleed,--an  augury for fatal events to follow. The story is told how little Oliver  fell into the Ouse and was fished out by a Royalist piscatorial parson.  Years afterwards, when the Protector revisited the scenes of his youth  in the midst of his triumphant army, he encountered his rescuer, and  asked him whether he remembered the occurrence.    \"Truly do I,\" was the prompt reply; \"and the Lord forgive me, but I wish  I'd let thee drown.\"    The Montagues became possessed of the estate in 1627. Pepys speaks of  \"the brave rooms and good pictures,\" which pleased him better than those  at Audley End. The Diarist's parental house remains at Brampton, a  little to the west of Huntingdon. In characteristic style he records a  visit there in October 1667: \"So away for Huntingdon mightily pleased  all along the road to remember old stories, and come to Brampton at  about noon, and there found my father and sister and brother all well:  and here laid up our things, and up and down to see the gardens with my  father, and the house; and do altogether find it very pretty, especially  the little parlour and the summer-houses in the garden, only the wall do  want greens up it, and the house is too low roofed; but that is only  because of my coming from a house with higher ceilings.\"    Before turning our steps northwards, let us glance at the mediaeval  bridge that spans the river Ouse, to Godmanchester, which is referred to  by the thirteenth-century historian _Henry of Huntingdon_ as \"a noble  city.\" But its nobility has long since departed, and some modern  monstrosities in architecture make the old Tudor buildings which  remain, blush for such brazen-faced obtrusion. Its ancient water-mill  externally looks so dilapidated, that one would think the next  \"well-formed depression\" from America would blow it to atoms. Not a bit  of it. Its huge timber beams within, smile at such fears. It is a  veritable fortress of timber. But although this solid wooden structure  defies the worst of gales, there are rumours of coming electric  tramways, and then, alas! the old mill will bow a dignified departure,  and the curfew, which yet survives, will then also perhaps think it is  time to be gone.    At Little Stukeley, on the Great North Road some three miles above  Huntingdon, is a queer old inn, the \"Swan and Salmon,\" bearing upon its  sign the date 1676. It is a good example of the brickwork of the latter  half of the seventeenth century. Like many another ancient hostelry on  the road to York, it is associated with Dick Turpin's exploits; and to  give colour to the tradition, mine host can point at a little masked  hiding-place situated somewhere at the back of the sign up in its gable  end. It certainly looks the sort of place that could relate stories of  highwaymen; a roomy old building, which no doubt in its day had  trap-doors and exits innumerable for the convenience of the gentlemen of  the road.    A little off the ancient \"Ermine Street,\" to the north-west of Stukeley,  is the insignificant village of Coppingford, historically interesting  from the fact that when Charles I. fled from Oxford in disguise in 1646,  he stopped the night there at a little obscure cottage or alehouse, on  his way to seek protection of the Scots at Southwell. \"This day one  hundred years ago,\" writes Dr. Stukeley in his _Memoirs_ on May 3, 1746,  \"King Charles, Mr. John Ashburnham, and Dr. Hudson came from Coppingford  in Huntingdonshire and lay at Mr. Alderman Wolph's house, now mine, on  Barn Hill; all the day obscure.\" Hudson, from whom Sir Walter drew his  character of Dr. Rochecliffe in _Woodstock_, records the fact in the  following words: \"We lay at Copingforde in Huntingdonshire one Sunday, 3  May; wente not to church, but I read prayers to the King; and at six at  night he went to Stamforde. I writte from Copingforde to Mr. Skipwith  for a horse, and he sente me one, which was brought to me at Stamforde.  ---- at Copingforde the King and me, with my hoste and hostis and two  children, were by the fire in the hall. There was noe other chimney in  the house.\"[3] The village of Little Gidding, still farther to the  north-west, had often before been visited by Charles in connection with  a religious establishment that had been founded there by the Ferrar  family. A curious old silk coffer, which was given by Charles to the  nieces of the founder, Nicholas Ferrar, upon one of these occasions,  some years ago came into the possession of our late queen, and is still  preserved at Windsor.    A few miles to the north-east is Glatton, another remote village where  old May-day customs yet linger. There are some quaint superstitions in  the rural districts hereabouts. A favourite remedy for infectious  disease is to open the window of the sickroom not so much to let in the  fresh air as to admit the gnats, which are believed to fly away with the  malady and die. The beneficial result is never attributed to oxygen!    The Roman road (if, indeed, it is the same, for some authorities incline  to the opinion that it ran parallel at some little distance away) is  unpicturesque and dreary. Towering double telegraph poles recur at set  intervals with mathematical regularity, and the breeze playing upon the  wires aloft brings forth that long-drawn melancholy wail only to make  the monotony more depressing. Half a mile from the main road, almost due  east of Glatton, stands Connington Hall, where linger sad memories of  the fate of Mary Queen of Scots. When the castle of Fotheringay was  demolished in 1625, Sir Robert Cotton had the great Hall in which she  was beheaded removed here. The curious carved oak chair which was used  by the poor Queen at Fotheringay until the day of her death may now be  seen in Connington Church, where also is the Tomb of Sir Robert, the  founder of the famous Cottonian Library.    [Illustration: THE BELL, STILTON]    A couple of miles or so to the north is Stilton, which bears an air of  decayed importance. A time-mellowed red-brick Queen Anne house, whose  huge wooden supports, like cripples' crutches, keep it from toppling  over, comes first in sight. In striking contrast, with its formal style  of architecture, is the picturesque outline of the ancient inn beyond. A  complicated flourish of ornamental ironwork, that would exasperate the  most expert freehand draughtsman, supports the weather-beaten sign of  solid copper. Upon the right-hand gable stands the date 1642, bringing  with it visions of the coming struggle between King and Parliament. But  the date is misleading, as may be seen from the stone groining upon the  "]]]
