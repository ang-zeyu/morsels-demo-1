When I found in these books, some of which  are truly only miserable rhapsodies, statements which were incorrect,  false, or slanderous, I, took pleasure in correcting such statements, or  in showing their absurdity. My wife, who lived, as I did, in the midst  of these events, also made her corrections, and, without other object  than our own satisfaction, made notes of our joint observations.    All who came to see us in our retreat, and took pleasure in having me  narrate what I had seen, were astonished and often indignant at the  falsehoods with which ignorance or malevolence had calumniated the  Emperor and the Empire, and expressing their gratitude for the correct  information I was able to give them, advised me also to furnish it to the  public. But I attached no importance to the suggestion, and was far from  dreaming that some day I should be the author of a book, until M.  Ladvocat came to our hermitage, and urged me earnestly to publish my  memoirs, offering himself to become the publisher.    At the very time my wife and I received this unexpected visit, we were  reading together the Memoirs of Bourrienne, which the Ladvocat  publishing-house had just issued; and we had remarked more than once how  exempt these Memoirs were from both that spirit of disparagement and of  adulation which we had noticed with disgust in other books on the same  subject. M. Ladvocat advised me to complete the sketch of the Emperor,  which, owing to his elevated position and habitual occupations,  Bourrienne had been able to make only from a political point of view; and  in accordance with his advice, I shall relate in simple words, and in a  manner suited to my relations with the Emperor, those things which  Bourrienne has necessarily omitted, and which no one could know so well  as I.    I candidly admit that my objections to M. Ladvocat's advice were entirely  overcome when he called my attention to this passage in the introduction  to Bourrienne's memoirs: \"If every one who had any relations with  Napoleon, whatever the time and place, will accurately and without  prejudice record what he saw and heard, the future historian of his life  will be rich in materials. I hope that whoever undertakes that difficult  task will find in my notes some information which may be useful in  perfecting his work.\"    Having re-read these lines attentively, I said to myself that I could  furnish memoranda and information which would refute errors, brand  falsehoods, and bring to light what I knew to be the truth. In a word, I  felt that I could give in my testimony, and that it was my duty to do so,  in the long trial which has been held ever since the overthrow of the  Emperor; for I had been an eye-witness, had seen everything, and could  say, \"I was there.\" Others also have been close to the Emperor and his  court, and I may often repeat what they have said, for the feats which  they describe I had the same opportunity of witnessing; but, on the other  hand, whatever I know of private matters, and whatever I may reveal which  was secret and unknown, no one till this time could possibly have known,  or consequently have related.    From the departure of the First Consul for the campaign of Marengo,  whither I went with him, until the departure from Fontainebleau, when I  was compelled to leave him, I was absent only twice, once for three days  and once for seven or eight days. Excepting these short leaves of  absence, the latter of which was on account of my health, I quitted the  Emperor no more than his shadow.    It has been said that no one is a hero to his valet de chambre. I beg  leave to dissent from this. The Emperor, as near as I was to him, was  always a hero; and it was a great advantage also to see the man as he  was. At a distance you were sensible only of the prestige of his glory  and his power; but on getting closer to him you enjoyed, besides, the  surprising charm of his conversation, the entire simplicity of his family  life, and I do not hesitate to say, the habitual kindliness of his  character.    The reader, if curious to learn beforehand in what spirit these Memoirs  are written, will perhaps read with interest this passage of a letter  that I wrote to my publisher:       \"Bourrienne had, perhaps, reason for treating Napoleon, as a public     man, with severity. But we view him from different standpoints, and     I speak only of the hero in undress. He was then almost always     kind, patient, and rarely unjust. He was much attached to those     about him, and received with kindness and good nature the services     of those whom he liked. He was a man of habit. It is as a devoted     servant that I wish to speak of the Emperor, and in no wise as a     critic. It is not, however, an apotheosis in several volumes that I     wish to write: for I am on this point somewhat like fathers who     recognize the faults of their children, and reprove them earnestly,     while at the same time they are ready to make excuses for their     errors.\"    I trust that I shall be pardoned the familiarity, or, if you will, the  inappropriateness of this comparison, for the sake of the feeling which  dictates it. Besides, I do not propose either to praise or blame, but  simply to relate that which fell within my knowledge, without trying to  prejudice the opinion of any one.    I cannot close this introduction without a few words as to myself, in  reply to the calumnies which have not spared, even in his retirement, a  man who should have no enemies, if, to be protected from malice, it were  sufficient to have done a little good, and no harm to any one. I am  reproached with having abandoned my master after his fall, and not having  shared his exile. I will show that, if I did not follow the Emperor, it  was because I lacked not the will but the power to do so. God knows that  I do not wish to undervalue the devotion of the faithful servants who  followed the fortunes of the Emperor to the end. However, it is not  improper to say that, however terrible the fall of the Emperor was for  him, the situation (I speak here only of the personal advantages), in the  island of Elba, of those who remained in his service, and who were not  detained in France by an inexorable necessity, was still not without its  advantages; and it was not, therefore, my personal interests which caused  me to leave him. I shall explain hereafter my reasons for quitting his  service.    I shall also give the truth as to the alleged abuse of confidence, of  which, according to others, I was guilty in respect to the Emperor.  A simple statement of the mistake which gave rise to this falsehood,  I trust, will clear me of every suspicion of indelicacy; but if it is  necessary to add other proofs, I could obtain them from those who lived  nearest to the Emperor, and who were in a condition to both know and  understand what passed between us; and lastly, I invoke fifty years of a  blameless life, and I can say: \"When I was in a situation to render great  services, I did so; but I never sold them. I could have derived  advantages from the petitions that I made for people, who, in consequence  of my solicitations, have acquired immense fortunes; but I refused even  the proper acknowledgment which in, their gratitude (very deep at that  time) they felt compelled to offer me, by proposing an interest in their  enterprises. I did not seek to take advantage, for my own benefit, of  the generosity with which the Emperor so long deigned to honor me, in  order to enrich or secure places for my relatives; and I retired poor  after fifteen years passed in the personal service of the richest and  most powerful monarch of Europe.\"    Having made these statements, I shall await with confidence the judgment  of my readers.          RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PRIVATE LIFE OF NAPOLEON    CHAPTER I.    I shall refer to myself very little in these memoirs, for I am aware the  public will examine them only for details concerning the great man to  whom fortune attached me for sixteen years, and whom I scarcely quitted  during the whole of that time. Notwithstanding, I ask permission to say  a few words as to my childhood, and the circumstances which made me valet  de chambre of the Emperor.    I was born Dec. 2, 1778, at Peruelz, a town which became French on the  annexation of Belgium to the Republic, and which then belonged to the  Department of Jemmapes. Soon after my birth at the baths of Saint Amand,  my father took charge of a small establishment called the Little Chateau,  at which visitors to the waters were boarding, being aided in this  enterprise by the Prince de Croi, in whose house he had been steward.  Business prospered beyond my father's hopes, for a great number of  invalids of rank came to his house. When I attained my eleventh year,  the Count de Lure, head of one of the chief families of Valenciennes,  happened to be one of the boarders at the Little Chateau; and as that  excellent man had taken a great fancy to me, he asked my parents  permission that I should become a companion to his son, who was about.  the same age. My family had intended me for the church, to gratify one  of my uncles, who was Dean of Lessine, a man of great wisdom and rigid  virtue; and thinking that the offer of the Count de Lure would not affect  my intended destination, my father accepted it, judging that some years  passed in a family so distinguished would give me a taste for the more  serious studies necessary to fit me for the priesthood. I set out,  therefore, with the Count de Lure, much grieved at leaving my parents,  but pleased also at the same time, as is usual with one at my age, with  new scenes. The count took me to one of his estates"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35802"],[0,"Lusitania: Canti popolari portoghesi (#2)"],[1,"mio nepote;          ben a tutti chiaro appar;          dalla troppa giovinezza          Ã¨ dipeso il tuo mancar.          Don Gaifero, chi piÃº t'ama,          quegli t'ha da castigar;          s'eri tu mal cavaliere,          io tenevo altro parlar.          Ma ti so bravo, e ti dico:          presto in armi e in sella; va'!          pronti sono al piacer tuo          l'armatura ed il caval;          ed io stesso, don Gaifero,          io ti voglio accompagnar.Â»            Â«Grazie: solo debbo andarvi;          solo, o zio, la vo' cercar:          l'armi vengano e 'l cavallo,          ch'io mi voglio incamminar:          del codardo a me, nessuno,          vivaddio, potrÃ  mai dar!Â»            Don Roldano la sua spada          ecco al giovine donar:            Â«Poi che solo brami andarvi,          questa t'ha da accompagnar:          generoso Ã¨ il mio cavallo;          violenza non gli far:          piÃº che sprone vuol la briglia;          te ne puoi, credi, fidar.Â»            Or mirate don Gaifero          come va di buon andar:          va per terre di cristiani,          e tra i Mori appresso va:          ne va tristo e pensieroso,          e fa tutto un sospirar:          Â«Melisendra mia dai Mori          come posso liberar?Â»            Alle porte Ã¨ di Sansonha,          ma non sa come vi entrar:          mentre pur bada e s'angustia,          te le vede spalancar.          Esce il re nella pianura          con sua gente a sollazzar;          tutti in abito da festa,          tutti allegri a cavalcar.          Don Gaifero un po' si scosta;          indi affrettasi ad entrar,          e si abbatte in un cristiano          schiavo intento a lavorar.            Â«Iddio t'abbia in guardia, o schiavo,          e ti renda a libertÃ :          dimmi, prego, in questa terra          hai sentito mentovar          certa dama di tua fede,          certa dama d'alto affar,          che andÃ² presa qui tra' Mori,          e non fa che lacrimar?Â»            Â«Cavaliere, Iddio sia teco          e ti guardi da ogni mal,          e altra sorte a me conceda,          c'ora Ã¨ tutto un tribolar.          Ai segnali che mi dÃ i,          ben io possoti affermar          che la dama onde tu cerchi,          lÃ  in Palazzo deve star.          Prendi quella via diritta          che al real castello va,          e vedrai cristiane molte          ai balconi a folleggiar.Â»            Ei la via diritta prende          che al palazzo capo fa,          e girati gli occhi in alto,          Melisendra vede star          appoggiata a una finestra,          e in un triste meditar          tanto assorta, che non sente          l'altre intorno sollazzar.          Ecco allora innanzi e indietro          don Gaifero a passeggiar.            Â«Oh che amabil cavaliere!          che garbato cavalcar!Â»            Â«Meglio che giocare a dama,          qui co' Mori a battagliar!Â»            Melisendra, che ciÃ² sente,          incomincia a lacrimar.          Non giÃ  ch'ella il riconosca:          non potealo ravvisar          cosÃ­ tutto in armi bianche,          sÃ­ diverso nel portar;          ma perchÃ© quel cavaliere          le fa in mente ritornar          i francesi paladini          e una terra senza par,          quelle giostre e que' tornei          che si usavano intimar,          quando, per la sua bellezza,          correan tutti ad armeggiar.          E con voce lamentosa          cominciavalo a pregar:            Â«Cavalier, se in Francia vai,          ambasciata hai da recar:          vo' che dica a don Gaifero          ch'e' non mi viene a cercar?          Se non teme egli de' Mori,          se non teme di pugnar,          altro amore Ã¨ la cagione          che me gli ha fatta scordar:          digli ch'io son presa e schiava,          e fo tutto un lacrimar.          Che se questo mio messaggio          non curasse d'ascoltar,          e tu recalo a Oliviero,          e tu il reca a don Beltran,          e all'imperator mio padre,          che mi mandi a riscattar.          ChÃ© qui mora voglion farmi          e il mio Cristo rinnegar;          e mi voglion dar a un Moro          delle parti lÃ  del mar,          e di sette re pagani          me regina incoronar.Â»            Â«Quest'ambasciata, o signora,          da te stessa gli puoi far:          don Gaifero Ã¨ qui presente,          e ti vien a liberar.Â»            Non avea finito ancora,          e le braccia tende giÃ :          ella tosto dal balcone          si calÃ² senza fiatar.          Quando un sozzo can di Moro,          ch'era messo a vigilar,          con quant'ha piÃº voce in gola,          cominciava ad esclamar:            Â«Accorrete a Melisendra,          chÃ© la rubano i cristian!Â»            Â«Melisendra sposa mia,          come potrem noi scampar?Â»            Â«Iddio, spero, e la madonna          ci vorranno accompagnar.Â»            Â«Melisendra, Melisendra,          qui gran forza si vuol far!Â»            Al cavallo apre la cigna,          e gli allarga il pettoral;          poi vi salta su d'un lancio,          senza la staffa toccar,          e alla vita prende lei,          che si allunga quanto sa:          la fa metter su la groppa,          perchÃ© possalo abbracciar.          DÃ  di sprone indi al cavallo,          che ne ha molto a sanguinar;          corre e corre e vola e vola:          chi saprebbelo arrivar?          Ed i Mori da ogni banda          tutti a correre e a gridar;          quante porte ha quella terra,          tutte a furia le serrÃ r.          Sette volte dei bastioni          pur invano il giro fa;          ma l'ottava il buon cavallo          riuscivali a saltar:[9]          quei di dentro nÃ© con gli occhi          piÃº li possono arrivar.          Sopraggiunse re Almansorre,          che tornava da cacciar.            Â«Su, fa' cuore, o Melisendra;          qui conviene scavalcar.          Sotto queste verdi piante          scendi un poco a riposar;          a que' cani io vado incontro,          ch'io li vegga spulezzar:          quanto valgano quest'armi          oggi vo' sperimentar.Â»            Smonta dunque Melisendra,          e Dio mettesi a pregar:          il cavallo a briglia sciolta          vola i Mori ad assaltar.          Parve giÃ  pigro a fuggire,          parve dianzi a stento andar;          fiuta adesso il sangue moro,          e si sente rinfiammar.          Don Gaifero pugna forte,          ma piÃº forte il suo caval;          fanno a gara tutti e due          chi piÃº Mori abbatterÃ .          GiÃ  ne cascan tanti e tanti,          che non son piÃº da contar;          corre sangue in tanta copia,          che va i campi ad allagar.          Re Almansorre, che ciÃ² vede,          cominciava ad esclamar:          AllÃ  invoca e Maometto,          chÃ© lo vogliano aiutar.            Â«Maledetto te, o cristiano,          e piÃº ancora il tuo pugnar!          non c'Ã¨ al mondo cavaliere          che ti possa pareggiar.          Sei tu forse Urgel di Nantes,[10]          Oliviero singolar,          o l'Infante don Guarino,          grand'ammiraglio del mar?          Non v'Ã¨ altri fra que' dodici[11]          da poterti fronteggiar,          se non fosse don Roldano,          quel fatato senza par.Â»          Don Gaifero, che ciÃ² sente,          questa a lui risposta dÃ :            Â«Taci, taci, o re de' Mori;          non Ã¨ savio il tuo parlar:          molti ha Francia cavalieri          che li possono uguagliar.          Io non son dei nominati,          e a conoscer mi vo' dar;          son l'Infante don Gaifero,          son nipote a don Roldan          capitano[12] di Parigi,          ch'Ã¨ mia terra natural.Â»            Altro il re non vuole udire,          nÃ© piÃº innanzi contrastar;          volge la briglia al cavallo,          e si va dentro a serrar.          Don Gaifero, solo in campo,          non ha piÃº con cui pugnar:          corre, pieno il cor di gioja,          la consorte a ritrovar.            Â«Sei ferito, sposo mio?          ah ferito hai da tornar!          eran tanti e tanti i Mori,          e tu solo a battagliar!          StrapperÃ² della camicia          mia le maniche a fasciar          le tue piaghe; col mio velo          le saprÃ² rimarginar.Â»            Â«Non dir queste cose, o Infanta;          non Ã¨ savio il tuo parlar:          s'eran anco a cento doppj,          a me nulla potean far:          del mio zio Roldano l'armi,          credi, son di buono acciar;          cavalier che se ne cinga          non puÃ² mai pericolar.Â»            E cavalcano e cavalcano,          senza punto riposar:          per le terre lÃ  de' Mori          senz'alcun sospetto van,          ragionando pur d'amore,          senza a null'altro pensar.          Nelle parti de' cristiani          finalmente ripassÃ r:          a Parigi eccoli giunti;          li va il popolo a incontrar          e ben sette leghe fuori          Ã¨ la corte ad aspettar.          Ecco vien l'imperatore          la sua figlia ad abbracciar;          le parole ch'ei le dice          fanno i sassi lacrimar.          Vedi il clero tutto quanto,          la piÃº eletta nobiltÃ ;          vedi i Pari tutti e dodici;[13]          nÃ© le dame puoi contar.          Alda v'era e don Roldano          e l'ammiraglio del mar;          l'arcivescovo Turpino,          don Giuliano d'Alem-mar,          e il buon vecchio don Beltrano,          e quanti altri usano star          presso l'alto imperatore          e alla sua mensa pranzar.[14]          Che onoranze a don Gaifero,          e che bel congratular!          Della molta sua prodezza          grandemente lui lodÃ r,          che la sposa ha liberato          con valore singolar.          Le gran feste che si fecero          non si posson raccontar.          NOTE      [Nota 4: HARDUNG, II, _pag. 13-24_.
