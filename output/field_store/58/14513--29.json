A good example of the first (Discomycetes) is found  in the Morel, and of the second (Tuberacei) in the Truffle.    In the Discomycetes or \"disk fungi,\" the spores are produced in minute  membraneous sacs, each sac usually containing eight spores. These spore  sacs are imbedded in the flesh of the exterior and upper surface of the  mushroom cap.    In the four classes, Hymenomycetes, Gasteromycetes, Discomycetes, and  Tuberacei, therefore, are included all of the plants which are here  designated under the generic term of \"mushrooms.\"    Some idea of the relative numerical value of these classes may be  obtained from the following figures given by the distinguished British  mycologist, M. C. Cooke:        \"Hymenomyceteae--total number of described species    9,600       Gasteromycetae--  \"     \"    \"     \"        \"          650       Discomyceteae--   \"     \"    \"   known      \"        3,500\"    (The Tuberacei comprise a very small group of subterranean fungi, and  comparatively few of the species are described.)    Saccardo in his Sylloge gives a total of 42,000 described species of  fungi of all classes, including the most minute. Of these the  Hymenomycetes include by far the largest number of edible mushrooms.    The family Hymenomycetes is divided into the following six orders:  Agaricini, Polyporei, Hydnei, Thelephorei, Clavarei, Tremellini.    In the order Agaricini the hymenium is found on the under surface of the  mushroom cap, covering pleats or gills, technically called lamellae.  These gills vary in character in the different genera, being \"persistent  in such as the Agaricus, Russula, and Lentinus, deliquescent (melting)  in Coprinus, Bolbitius, etc. The edge of the gills is acute in Agaricus,  Marasmius, etc., but obtuse and vein-like in Cantharellus,  longitudinally channelled in Trogia, and splitting in Schyzophyllum.\"    In the Polyporei, pore-bearing mushrooms, the gills are replaced by  tubes or pores. The tubes are little cylinders, long or short, pressed  one against another, forming by their union a layer on the under surface  of the cap, and the sporiferous membrane or hymenium lines their inner  walls. Their upper end is always closed, while the lower extremity is  open to permit the outward passage of the spores. The tubes are  generally joined together and are not easily disunited. They are free,  _i. e._, separable, in the sole genus _Fistulina_. As regards their  attachment to the cap, the tubes may be firmly adherent as in the genus  Polyporus or easily detached in a single mass as in Boletus, the fleshy  form of the order Polyporei. They frequently leave a circular space of  greater or less dimensions around the stem, or they adhere to or are  prolonged upon it in such a manner that the orifices rise in tiers one  above another. The color of the tubes, although not offering as  characteristic varieties as that of the gills, changes nevertheless  according to species and according to the age of the plant. The tubes  may sometimes be of a different color from their orifices, as in  _Boletus luridus_. In some of the Boleti the color of the flesh is  changed on exposure to the air and the tubes often assume the same  tints. The tubes, generally called pores, are sometimes closely adherent  to the substance of the cap, which is often hard, corky, or coriaceous,  as seen in most of the _Polyporei_.    In the Hydnei, spine-bearing mushrooms, the hymenium is seen covering  the spines or needle-like processes which take the place of gills in  this order, and which project from the under surface of the cap. These  spines may be divided or entire, simple or ramified, and are formed of  the substance of the cap. In the early stages of development they appear  like small projecting points or papillae, those on the margin of the cap  and at the apex of the stem being always less developed, frequently  remaining in this rudimentary state. They are rounded in the species  Hydnum imbricatum, sometimes compressed in Hydnum repandum, sometimes  terminating in hairs or filaments, as in Hydnum barba Jovis, or very  much divided, as in Hydnum fimbriatum.    In the Clavarei, the whole plant consists of solid fleshy masses  without any stem of a distinct substance, sometimes club-shaped,  sometimes branched with the hymenium smoothly covering the entire  surface, never incrusting or coriaceous.    In the Thelephorei, the lower surface of the cap presents neither gills,  pores, nor spines, but instead the hymenium covers an uneven or slightly  wrinkled surface, partially striate, sometimes obscurely papillose. The  plants of this order assume a great variety of shape, from that of a  perfect cup with a central stem to an irregularly and much branched  frond. They are generally dry and tough. Very few are recommended as  edible. Prof. Peck says of this order that probably no edible species  will be found in any of its genera outside of the genus Craterellus.    In the order Tremellini we have a great departure from the character of  the substance, external appearance, and internal structure of the other  orders of the Hymenomycetes. The substance is gelatinous; the form is  lobed, folded, or convolute, often resembling the brain of some animal.  It is uniformly composed throughout of a colorless mucilage, with no  appreciable texture, in which are distributed very fine, diversely  branched, and anastomosing filaments. Towards the surface the ultimate  branches of this filamentous network give birth to globular cells, both  at their summits and laterally, which attain a comparatively large size.  These cells are filled with a protoplasm, to which the plant owes its  color. The fertile threads are not compacted into a true hymenium.    Representative types of the above-described orders of the Hymenomycetes  are shown in Plate B. The various genera, and species of these orders,  will be described more in detail in connection with the species  illustrated.          CLASSIFICATION.      Owing to the fact that botanists of various countries, writing in  diverse languages, have for more than a century been engaged in  describing the fungi of their respective countries, with their work  frequently unknown to one another, it is not surprising that there has  been constant revision, or that many changes have been made in the way  of classification and nomenclature which to the amateur student are  often confusing.    The classification by the pioneer mycologist, Elias Fries, as presented  in his several works on fungi, ignored all microscopical characters, and  Saccardo's classification, as presented in his _Sylloge Fungorum_, was  the first complete system offered in its place.    Saccardo, in 1882, commenced his Sylloge, of which not less than twelve  volumes have been published. In Saccardo's system of classification the  six orders of the Hymenomycetes are not essentially different in their  arrangement from that of Fries, although Saccardo has raised all the  subgenera of Agaricus to the rank of genera, and then altered their  sequence so as to bring them into four sections, distinguished by the  color of their spores. Having raised the old subgenera of Fries to  generic rank, Saccardo found it necessary to limit the application of  the term Agaricus to the group of fungi to which it was originally  applied by Linnaeus, viz., the common field mushroom Agaricus campester,  and its allies, represented by Agaricus arvensis, Agaricus Rodmani,  etc., or, as Prof. Peck more definitely states it, \"to those of the  gilled mushrooms which have brown spores, free gills, a stem bearing a  ring, gills generally pink-colored in the early stage, and brownish  black when fully matured.\" M. C. Cooke, the distinguished English  mycologist, prefers to retain the _genus Agaricus_ with its original  subgenera intact, succeeded by the other genera of Agaricini, as in the  Hymenomycetes Europei of Fries, giving as his reason the belief \"that  for purposes of classification features should be taken which are  present and evident in the specimens themselves, and are not dependent  on any of their life-history which cannot be presented in the  herbarium.\"    In a work such as the present, which is designed to be popular in  character rather than purely technical, it is deemed advisable to select  as a basis for classification that system which is most accessible to  reference by the general reading public. Saccardo's Sylloge, while  exhaustive in character and of inestimable value to the mycologist, is  written in Latin, and is, moreover, a very expensive work--facts which  render it practically unavailable to the general public.    In the compilation of this series of pamphlets I have adopted the  classification of M. C. Cooke, which, as regards the Hymenomycetes, the  family containing most of the fleshy fungi, is, with exceptions noted,  in accord with that of Saccardo. M. C. Cooke's hand-book of fungi is of  convenient size and form for ready reference.    For the convenience, however, of those who may wish to familiarize  themselves with both systems, a synopsis of _Saccardo's Genera_ of  Hymenomycetes will be given later.          STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AGARICINI.      By far the greater number of the Agaricini have both cap and stem. The  form of the cap, as well as that of the stem, varies somewhat in the  different genera and species. Those which are terrestrial in habit are  generally of an umbrella-like shape, while those which grow upon trees  and decayed tree-stumps are apt to be one-sided or semi-spherical.    In many of the parasitical mushrooms the stem is absent. Where the stem  is present it is either an interrupted continuation of the hymenophore  or fleshy substance of the cap, or else is supported separately as a  pillar on which the cap rests, a more or less distinct line of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#2)"],[1,"Stock--Size of Matings--Breeding and Laying          Season--Management of          Breeders--Housing--Feeding--Water--Yards--Care of Eggs          for Hatching--Hatching the Eggs--Brooding and          Rearing--Feeding the Ducklings--Water for          Ducklings--Distinguishing the Sexes--Marketing the          Ducks--Diseases and Insect Pests.

According to the 1920 census  there were 2,817,624 ducks in the United States with a valuation of  $3,373,966. As compared with this the census for 1910 shows a slightly  greater number of ducks, 2,906,525, but their value was considerably  less being only $1,567,164. In the ten years between the census of 1900  and that of 1910 there was a decrease in the number of ducks of nearly  40%.    According to the 1920 census the more important duck raising states  arranged in their order of importance were Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania,  New York, Missouri, Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, South Dakota, Indiana,  Nebraska and Kentucky. The number reported for Iowa was 235,249 and for  Kentucky 99,577. New England, the North Atlantic, the East North  Central, the West North Central, the Mountain and the Pacific states  showed an increase, while the South Atlantic, East South Central and  West South Central states showed a decrease. In spite of the existence  of quite a number of large commercial duck farms, the great bulk of  ducks produced are those which come from the general farms where only  small flocks are kept. Yet only a small proportion of farms have ducks  on them. The comparatively small number of ducks is distributed over  practically the entire United States, being more common in some sections  than others, particularly along the Atlantic Coast and along the Pacific  Coast, with fairly numerous flocks on the farms of the Middle West.    _Different Types of Duck Raising._ The conditions under which ducks are  kept and the purpose for which they are kept fall under four heads:  First, commercial duck raising for the production of duck meat; second,  duck raising as a by-product of the general farm; third, duck raising  for egg production; fourth, duck breeding for pleasure, exhibition or  the sale of breeding stock.    _Opportunities for Duck Raising._ Undoubtedly the greatest opportunity  for profitable duck growing lies under the first of these heads, namely,  commercial duck raising. Where the conditions of climate, soil and land  are favorable and where the location is good with respect to market  there exists an excellent opportunity for one skilled in duck growing to  engage in that business in an intensive manner for the purpose of  putting on the market spring or green ducklings. Where these are in  demand they bring a good price and since the output per farm is large  they pay a good return even with a small margin of profit per pound.    The second greatest opportunity undoubtedly consists of duck raising as  a by-product of the general farm."]]]
