Political and social institutions are to be judged by the good or harm  that they do to individuals.  Do they encourage creativeness rather  than possessiveness?  Do they embody or promote a spirit of reverence  between human beings?  Do they preserve self-respect?    In all these ways the institutions under which we live are very far  indeed from what they ought to be.    Institutions, and especially economic systems, have a profound  influence in molding the characters of men and women.  They may  encourage adventure and hope, or timidity and the pursuit of safety.  They may open men's minds to great possibilities, or close them  against everything but the risk of obscure misfortune.  They may make  a man's happiness depend upon what he adds to the general possessions  of the world, or upon what he can secure for himself of the private  goods in which others cannot share.  Modern capitalism forces the  wrong decision of these alternatives upon all who are not heroic or  exceptionally fortunate.    Men's impulses are molded, partly by their native disposition, partly  by opportunity and environment, especially early environment.  Direct  preaching can do very little to change impulses, though it can lead  people to restrain the direct expression of them, often with the  result that the impulses go underground and come to the surface again  in some contorted form.  When we have discovered what kinds of impulse  we desire, we must not rest content with preaching, or with trying to  produce the outward manifestation without the inner spring; we must  try rather to alter institutions in the way that will, of itself,  modify the life of impulse in the desired direction.    At present our institutions rest upon two things: property and power.  Both of these are very unjustly distributed; both, in the actual  world, are of great importance to the happiness of the individual.  Both are possessive goods; yet without them many of the goods in which  all might share are hard to acquire as things are now.    Without property, as things are, a man has no freedom, and no security  for the necessities of a tolerable life; without power, he has no  opportunity for initiative.  If men are to have free play for their  creative impulses, they must be liberated from sordid cares by a  certain measure of security, and they must have a sufficient share of  power to be able to exercise initiative as regards the course and  conditions of their lives.    Few men can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a  world which is wholly built on competition, where the great majority  would fall into utter destitution if they became careless as to the  acquisition of material goods, where honor and power and respect are  given to wealth rather than to wisdom, where the law embodies and  consecrates the injustice of those who have toward those who have not.  In such an environment even those whom nature has endowed with great  creative gifts become infected with the poison of competition.  Men  combine in groups to attain more strength in the scramble for material  goods, and loyalty to the group spreads a halo of quasi-idealism round  the central impulse of greed.  Trade-unions and the Labor party are no  more exempt from this vice than other parties and other sections of  society; though they are largely inspired by the hope of a radically  better world.  They are too often led astray by the immediate object  of securing for themselves a large share of material goods.  That this  desire is in accordance with justice, it is impossible to deny; but  something larger and more constructive is needed as a political ideal,  if the victors of to-morrow are not to become the oppressors of the  day after.  The inspiration and outcome of a reforming movement ought  to be freedom and a generous spirit, not niggling restrictions and  regulations.    The present economic system concentrates initiative in the hands of a  small number of very rich men.  Those who are not capitalists have,  almost always, very little choice as to their activities when once  they have selected a trade or profession; they are not part of the  power that moves the mechanism, but only a passive portion of the  machinery.  Despite political democracy, there is still an  extraordinary degree of difference in the power of self-direction  belonging to a capitalist and to a man who has to earn his living.  Economic affairs touch men's lives, at most times, much more  intimately than political questions.  At present the man who has no  capital usually has to sell himself to some large organization, such  as a railway company, for example.  He has no voice in its management,  and no liberty in politics except what his trade-union can secure for  him.  If he happens to desire a form of liberty which is not thought  important by his trade-union, he is powerless; he must submit or  starve.    Exactly the same thing happens to professional men.  Probably a  majority of journalists are engaged in writing for newspapers whose  politics they disagree with; only a man of wealth can own a large  newspaper, and only an accident can enable the point of view or the  interests of those who are not wealthy to find expression in a  newspaper.  A large part of the best brains of the country are in the  civil service, where the condition of their employment is silence  about the evils which cannot be concealed from them.  A Nonconformist  minister loses his livelihood if his views displease his congregation;  a member of Parliament loses his seat if he is not sufficiently supple  or sufficiently stupid to follow or share all the turns and twists of  public opinion.  In every walk of life, independence of mind is  punished by failure, more and more as economic organizations grow  larger and more rigid.  Is it surprising that men become increasingly  docile, increasingly ready to submit to dictation and to forego the  right of thinking for themselves?  Yet along such lines civilization  can only sink into a Byzantine immobility.    Fear of destitution is not a motive out of which a free creative life  can grow, yet it is the chief motive which inspires the daily work of  most wage-earners.  The hope of possessing more wealth and power than  any man ought to have, which is the corresponding motive of the rich,  is quite as bad in its effects; it compels men to close their minds  against justice, and to prevent themselves from thinking honestly on  social questions while in the depths of their hearts they uneasily  feel that their pleasures are bought by the miseries of others.  The  injustices of destitution and wealth alike ought to be rendered  impossible.  Then a great fear would be removed from the lives of the  many, and hope would have to take on a better form in the lives of the  few.    But security and liberty are only the negative conditions for good  political institutions.  When they have been won, we need also the  positive condition: encouragement of creative energy.  Security alone  might produce a smug and stationary society; it demands creativeness  as its counterpart, in order to keep alive the adventure and interest  of life, and the movement toward perpetually new and better things.  There can be no final goal for human institutions; the best are those  that most encourage progress toward others still better.  Without  effort and change, human life cannot remain good.  It is not a  finished Utopia that we ought to desire, but a world where imagination  and hope are alive and active.    It is a sad evidence of the weariness mankind has suffered from  excessive toil that his heavens have usually been places where nothing  ever happened or changed.  Fatigue produces the illusion that only  rest is needed for happiness; but when men have rested for a time,  boredom drives them to renewed activity.  For this reason, a happy  life must be one in which there is activity.  If it is also to be a  useful life, the activity ought to be as far as possible creative, not  merely predatory or defensive.  But creative activity requires  imagination and originality, which are apt to be subversive of the  _status quo_.  At present, those who have power dread a disturbance of  the _status quo_, lest their unjust privileges should be taken away.  In combination with the instinct for conventionality,[1] which man  shares with the other gregarious animals, those who profit by the  existing order have established a system which punishes originality  and starves imagination from the moment of first going to school down  to the time of death and burial.  The whole spirit in which education  is conducted needs to be changed, in order that children may be  encouraged to think and feel for themselves, not to acquiesce  passively in the thoughts and feelings of others.  It is not rewards  after the event that will produce initiative, but a certain mental  atmosphere.  There have been times when such an atmosphere existed:  the great days of Greece, and Elizabethan England, may serve as  examples.  But in our own day the tyranny of vast machine-like  organizations, governed from above by men who know and care little for  the lives of those whom they control, is killing individuality and  freedom of mind, and forcing men more and more to conform to a uniform  pattern.    [1] In England this is called \"a sense of humor.\"    Vast organizations are an inevitable element in modern life, and it is  useless to aim at their abolition, as has been done by some reformers,  for instance, William Morris.  It is true that they make the  preservation of individuality more difficult, but what is needed is a  way of combining them with the greatest possible scope for individual  initiative.    One very important step toward this end would be to render democratic  the government of every organization.

He had always heard  his mamma called by pretty, loving names, and so he used them himself  when he spoke to her; he had always seen that his papa watched over her  and took great care of her, and so he learned, too, to be careful of  her.    So when he knew his papa would come back no more, and saw how very  sad his mamma was, there gradually came into his kind little heart the  thought that he must do what he could to make her happy. He was not much  more than a baby, but that thought was in his mind whenever he climbed  upon her knee and kissed her and put his curly head on her neck, and  when he brought his toys and picture-books to show her, and when he  curled up quietly by her side as she used to lie on the sofa. He was not  old enough to know of anything else to do, so he did what he could, and  was more of a comfort to her than he could have understood.    \"Oh, Mary!\" he heard her say once to her old servant; \"I am sure he  is trying to help me in his innocent way--I know he is. He looks at me  sometimes with a loving, wondering little look, as if he were sorry for  me, and then he will come and pet me or show me something. He is such a  little man, I really think he knows.\"    As he grew older, he had a great many quaint little ways which amused  and interested people greatly. He was so much of a companion for his  mother that she scarcely cared for any other. They used to walk together  and talk together and play together. When he was quite a little fellow,  he learned to read; and after that he used to lie on the hearth-rug, in  the evening, and read aloud--sometimes stories, and sometimes big books  such as older people read, and sometimes even the newspaper; and often  at such times Mary, in the kitchen, would hear Mrs. Errol laughing with  delight at the quaint things he said.    \"And, indade,\" said Mary to the groceryman, \"nobody cud help laughin' at  the quare little ways of him--and his ould-fashioned sayin's! Didn't  he come into my kitchen the noight the new Prisident was nominated and  shtand afore the fire, lookin' loike a pictur', wid his hands in his  shmall pockets, an' his innocent bit of a face as sayrious as a jedge?  An' sez he to me: 'Mary,' sez he, 'I'm very much int'rusted in the  'lection,' sez he. 'I'm a 'publican, an' so is Dearest. Are you a  'publican, Mary?' 'Sorra a bit,' sez I; 'I'm the bist o' dimmycrats!'  An' he looks up at me wid a look that ud go to yer heart, an' sez he:  'Mary,' sez he, 'the country will go to ruin.' An' nivver a day since  thin has he let go by widout argyin' wid me to change me polytics.\"    Mary was very fond of him, and very proud of him, too. She had been with  his mother ever since he was born; and, after his father's death, had  been cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else. She was proud of  his graceful, strong little body and his pretty manners, and especially  proud of the bright curly hair which waved over his forehead and fell in  charming love-locks on his shoulders. She was willing to work early and  late to help his mamma make his small suits and keep them in order.    \"'Ristycratic, is it?\" she would say. \"Faith, an' I'd loike to see the  choild on Fifth Avey-NOO as looks loike him an' shteps out as handsome  as himself. An' ivvery man, woman, and choild lookin' afther him in his  bit of a black velvet skirt made out of the misthress's ould gownd; an'  his little head up, an' his curly hair flyin' an' shinin'. It's loike a  young lord he looks.\"    Cedric did not know that he looked like a young lord; he did not  know what a lord was. His greatest friend was the groceryman at the  corner--the cross groceryman, who was never cross to him. His name was  Mr. Hobbs, and Cedric admired and respected him very much. He thought  him a very rich and powerful person, he had so many things in his  store,--prunes and figs and oranges and biscuits,--and he had a  horse and wagon. Cedric was fond of the milkman and the baker and the  apple-woman, but he liked Mr. Hobbs best of all, and was on terms of  such intimacy with him that he went to see him every day, and often sat  with him quite a long time, discussing the topics of the hour. It was  quite surprising how many things they found to talk about--the Fourth  of July, for instance. When they began to talk about the Fourth of July  there really seemed no end to it. Mr. Hobbs had a very bad opinion of  \"the British,\" and he told the whole story of the Revolution, relating  very wonderful and patriotic stories about the villainy of the enemy and  the bravery of the Revolutionary heroes, and he even generously repeated  part of the Declaration of Independence.    Cedric was so excited that his eyes shone and his cheeks were red and  his curls were all rubbed and tumbled into a yellow mop. He could hardly  wait to eat his dinner after he went home, he was so anxious to tell  his mamma. It was, perhaps, Mr. Hobbs who gave him his first interest  in politics. Mr. Hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers, and so Cedric  heard a great deal about what was going on in Washington; and Mr. Hobbs  would tell him whether the President was doing his duty or not. And  once, when there was an election, he found it all quite grand, and  probably but for Mr. Hobbs and Cedric the country might have been  wrecked.    Mr. Hobbs took him to see a great torchlight procession, and many of the  men who carried torches remembered afterward a stout man who stood near  a lamp-post and held on his shoulder a handsome little shouting boy, who  waved his cap in the air.    It was not long after this election, when Cedric was between seven and  eight years old, that the very strange thing happened which made so  wonderful a change in his life. It was quite curious, too, that the  day it happened he had been talking to Mr. Hobbs about England and  the Queen, and Mr. Hobbs had said some very severe things about the  aristocracy, being specially indignant against earls and marquises. It  had been a hot morning; and after playing soldiers with some friends  of his, Cedric had gone into the store to rest, and had found Mr. Hobbs  looking very fierce over a piece of the Illustrated London News, which  contained a picture of some court ceremony.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"that's the way they go on now; but they'll get enough  of it some day, when those they've trod on rise and blow 'em up  sky-high,--earls and marquises and all! It's coming, and they may look  out for it!\"    Cedric had perched himself as usual on the high stool and pushed his  hat back, and put his hands in his pockets in delicate compliment to Mr.  Hobbs.    \"Did you ever know many marquises, Mr. Hobbs?\" Cedric inquired,--\"or  earls?\"    \"No,\" answered Mr. Hobbs, with indignation; \"I guess not. I'd like to  catch one of 'em inside here; that's all! I'll have no grasping tyrants  sittin' 'round on my cracker-barrels!\"    And he was so proud of the sentiment that he looked around proudly and  mopped his forehead.    \"Perhaps they wouldn't be earls if they knew any better,\" said Cedric,  feeling some vague sympathy for their unhappy condition.    \"Wouldn't they!\" said Mr. Hobbs. \"They just glory in it! It's in 'em.  They're a bad lot.\"    They were in the midst of their conversation, when Mary appeared.    Cedric thought she had come to buy some sugar, perhaps, but she had not.  She looked almost pale and as if she were excited about something.    \"Come home, darlint,\" she said; \"the misthress is wantin' yez.\"    Cedric slipped down from his stool.    \"Does she want me to go out with her, Mary?\" he asked. \"Good-morning,  Mr. Hobbs. I'll see you again.\"    He was surprised to see Mary staring at him in a dumfounded fashion, and  he wondered why she kept shaking her head.    \"What's the matter, Mary?\" he said. \"Is it the hot weather?\"    \"No,\" said Mary; \"but there's strange things happenin' to us.\"    \"Has the sun given Dearest a headache?\" he inquired anxiously.    But it was not that. When he reached his own house there was a coupe  standing before the door and some one was in the little parlor talking  to his mamma. Mary hurried him upstairs and put on his best summer  suit of cream-colored flannel, with the red scarf around his waist, and  combed out his curly locks.    \"Lords, is it?\" he heard her say. \"An' the nobility an' gintry. Och! bad  cess to them! Lords, indade--worse luck.\"    It was really very puzzling, but he felt sure his mamma would tell him  what all the excitement meant, so he allowed Mary to bemoan herself  without asking many questions. When he was dressed, he ran downstairs  and went into the parlor. A tall, thin old gentleman with a sharp face  was sitting in an arm-chair. His mother was standing near by with a pale  face, and he saw that there were tears in her eyes.    \"Oh! Ceddie!\" she cried out, and ran to her little boy and caught him  in her arms and kissed him in a frightened, troubled way. \"Oh! Ceddie,  darling!\"    The tall old gentleman rose from his chair and looked at Cedric with his  sharp eyes. He rubbed his thin chin with his bony hand as he looked.    He seemed not at all displeased.    \"And so,\" he said at last, slowly,--\"and so this is little Lord  Fauntleroy.\"          II    There was never a more amazed little boy than Cedric during the week  that followed; there was never so strange or so unreal a week. In the  first place, the story his mamma told him was a very curious one. He was  obliged to hear it two or three times before he could understand it. He  could not imagine what Mr. Hobbs would think of it. It began with earls:  his grandpapa, whom he had never seen, was an earl; and his eldest  uncle, if he had not been killed by a fall from his horse, would have  been an earl, too, in time; and after his death, his other uncle would  have been an earl, if he had not died suddenly, in Rome, of a fever.  After that, his own papa, if he had lived, would"]]]
