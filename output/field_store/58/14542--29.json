So she scrapes away with her mandibles, keeping within a certain radius,  a radius that corresponds with the dimensions of the cell which she is  going to build next; moreover, she conducts her work in such a way as to  hollow out more in the middle and leave the two ends contracted. In this  manner, the cylindrical channel of the start is succeeded, in the worked  portion, by an ovoid cavity flattened at both ends, a space resembling a  little barrel. This space will form the second cell.    As for the rubbish, it is utilized on the spot for the lid or cover  that serves as a ceiling for one cell and a floor for the next. Our own  master-builders could not contrive more successfully to make the best  use of their labourers' time. On the floor thus obtained, a second  ration of honey is placed; and an egg is laid on the surface of the  paste. Lastly, at the upper end of the little barrel, a partition is  built with the scrapings obtained in the course of the final work on the  third cell, which itself is shaped like a flattened ovoid. And so the  work goes on, cell upon cell, each supplying the materials for the  partition separating it from the one below. On reaching the end of the  cylinder, the Osmia closes up the case with a thick layer of the same  mortar. Then that bramble-stump is done with; the Bee will not return  to it. If her ovaries are not yet exhausted, other dry stems will be  exploited in the same fashion.    The number of cells varies greatly, according to the qualities of the  stalk. If the bramble-stump be long, regular and smooth, we may count  as many as fifteen: that, at least, is the highest figure which my  observations have supplied. To obtain a good idea of the internal  distribution, we must split the stalk lengthwise, in the winter, when  the provisions have long been consumed and when the larvae are wrapped  in their cocoons. We then see that, at regular intervals, the case  becomes slightly narrower; and in each of the necks thus formed a  circular disk is fixed, a partition one or two millimetres thick.  (.039 to.079 inch.--Translator's Note.) The rooms separated by these  partitions form so many little barrels or kegs, each compactly filled  with a reddish, transparent cocoon, through which the larva shows,  bent into a fish-hook. The whole suggests a string of rough, oval amber  beads, touching at their amputated ends.    In this string of cocoons, which is the oldest, which the youngest? The  oldest is obviously the bottom one, the one whose cell was the first  built; the youngest is the one at the top of the row, the one in the  cell last built. The oldest of the larvae starts the pile, down at the  bottom of the gallery; the latest arrival ends it at the top; and those  in between follow upon one another, according to age, from base to apex.    Let us next observe that there is no room in the shaft for two Osmiae at  a time on the same level, for each cocoon fills up the storey, the keg  that belongs to it, without leaving any vacant space; let us also remark  that, when they attain the stage of perfection, the Osmiae must all  emerge from the shaft by the only orifice which the bramble-stem  boasts, the orifice at the top. There is here but one obstacle, easy  to overcome: a plug of glued pith, of which the insect's mandibles make  short work. Down below, the stalk offers no ready outlet; besides, it is  prolonged underground indefinitely by the roots. Everywhere else is the  ligneous fence, generally too hard and thick to break through. It is  inevitable therefore that all the Osmiae, when the time comes to quit  their dwelling, should go out by the top; and, as the narrowness of  the shaft bars the passage of the preceding insect as long as the next  insect, the one above it, remains in position, the removal must begin at  the top, extend from cell to cell and end at the bottom. Consequently,  the order of exit is the converse to the order of birth: the younger  Osmiae leave the nest first, their elders leave it last.    The oldest, that is to say, the bottom one, was the first to finish her  supply of honey and to spin her cocoon. Taking precedence of all her  sisters in the whole series of her actions, she was the first to burst  her silken bag and to destroy the ceiling that closes her room: at  least, that is what the logic of the situation takes for granted. In  her anxiety to get out, how will she set about her release? The way  is blocked by the nearest cocoons, as yet intact. To clear herself a  passage through the string of those cocoons would mean to exterminate  the remainder of the brood; the deliverance of one would mean the  destruction of all the rest. Insects are notoriously obstinate in their  actions and unscrupulous in their methods. If the Bee at the bottom of  the shaft wants to leave her lodging, will she spare those who bar her  road?    The difficulty is great, obviously; it seems insuperable. Thereupon we  become suspicious: we begin to wonder if the emergence from the cocoon,  that is to say, the hatching, really takes place in the order of  primogeniture. Might it not be--by a very singular exception, it  is true, but one which is necessary in such circumstances--that the  youngest of the Osmiae bursts her cocoon first and the oldest last; in  short, that the hatching proceeds from one chamber to the next in the  inverse direction to that which the age of the occupants would lead us  to presume? In that case, the whole difficulty would be removed: each  Osmia, as she rent her silken prison, would find a clear road in front  of her, the Osmiae nearer the outlet having gone out before her. But is  this really how things happen? Our theories very often do not agree with  the insect's practice; even where our reasoning seems most logical,  we should be more prudent to see what happens before venturing on any  positive statements. Leon Dufour was not so prudent when he, the first  in the field, took this little problem in hand. He describes to us the  habits of an Odynerus (Odynerus rubicola, DUF.) who piles up clay cells  in the shaft of a dry bramble-stalk; and, full of enthusiasm for his  industrious Wasp, he goes on to say:    'Picture a string of eight cement shells, placed end to end and closely  wedged inside a wooden sheath. The lowest was undeniably made first and  consequently contains the first-laid egg, which, according to rules,  should give birth to the first winged insect. How do you imagine  that the larva in that first shell was bidden to waive its right of  primogeniture and only to complete its metamorphosis after all its  juniors? What are the conditions brought into play to produce a result  apparently so contrary to the laws of nature? Humble yourself in the  presence of the reality and confess your ignorance, rather than attempt  to hide your embarrassment under vain explanations!    'If the first egg laid by the busy mother were destined to be the  first-born of the Odyneri, that one, in order to see the light  immediately after achieving wings, would have had the option either of  breaking through the double walls of his prison or of perforating, from  bottom to top, the seven shells ahead of him, in order to emerge through  the truncate end of the bramble-stem. Now nature, while refusing any  way of escape laterally, was also bound to veto any direct invasion, the  brutal gimlet-work which would inevitably have sacrificed seven members  of one family for the safety of an only son. Nature is as ingenious in  design as she is fertile in resource, and she must have foreseen and  forestalled every difficulty. She decided that the last-built cradle  should yield the first-born child; that this one should clear the road  for his next oldest brother, the second for the third and so on. And  this is the order in which the birth of our Odyneri of the Brambles  actually takes place.'    Yes, my revered master, I will admit without hesitation that the  bramble-dwellers leave their sheath in the converse order to that of  their ages: the youngest first, the oldest last; if not invariably, at  least very often. But does the hatching, by which I mean the emergence  from the cocoon, take place in the same order? Does the evolution of  the elder wait upon that of the younger, so that each may give those who  would bar his passage time to effect their deliverance and to leave  the road clear? I very much fear that logic has carried your deductions  beyond the bounds of reality. Rationally speaking, my dear sir, nothing  could be more accurate than your inferences; and yet we must forgo  the theory of the strange inversion which you suggest. None of the  Bramble-bees with whom I have experimented behaves after that fashion.  I know nothing personal about Odynerus rubicola, who appears to be a  stranger in my district; but, as the method of leaving must be almost  the same when the habitation is exactly similar, it is enough, I think,  to experiment with some of the bramble-dwellers in order to learn the  history of the rest.    My studies will, by preference, bear upon the Three-pronged Osmia, who  lends herself more readily to laboratory experiments, both because she  is stronger and because the same stalk will contain a goodly number of  her cells. The first fact to be ascertained is the order of hatching.  I take a glass tube, closed at one end, open at the other and of a  diameter similar to that of the Osmia's tunnel. In this I place, one  above the other, exactly in their natural order, the ten cocoons, or  thereabouts, which I extract from a stump of bramble. The operation is  performed in winter. The larvae, at that time, have long been enveloped  in their silken case. To separate the cocoons from one another, I employ"]]]
