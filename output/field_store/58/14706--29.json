[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#2)"],[1,"    Several causes have led to the revision of this tragic period.  Time has calmed passions, numerous documents have gradually  emerged from the archives, and the historian is learning to  interpret them independently.    But it is perhaps modern psychology that has most effectually  influenced our ideas, by enabling us more surely to read men and  the motives of their conduct.    Among those of its discoveries which are henceforth applicable to  history we must mention, above all, a more profound understanding  of ancestral influences, the laws which rule the actions of the  crowd, data relating to the disaggregation of personality, mental  contagion, the unconscious formation of beliefs, and the  distinction between the various forms of logic.    To tell the truth, these applications of science, which are  utilised in this book, have not been so utilised hitherto.  Historians have generally stopped short at the study of  documents, and even that study is sufficient to excite the doubts  of which I have spoken.      The great events which shape the destinies of peoples--  revolutions, for example, and the outbreak of religious beliefs--  are sometimes so difficult to explain that one must limit oneself  to a mere statement.    From the time of my first historical researches I have been  struck by the impenetrable aspect of certain essential phenomena,  those relating to the genesis of beliefs especially; I felt  convinced that something fundamental was lacking that was  essential to their interpretation.  Reason having said all it  could say, nothing more could be expected of it, and other means  must be sought of comprehending what had not been elucidated.    For a long time these important questions remained obscure to me.  Extended travel, devoted to the study of the remnants of vanished  civilisations, had not done much to throw light upon them.    Reflecting upon it continually, I was forced to recognise that  the problem was composed of a series of other problems, which I  should have to study separately.  This I did for a period of  twenty years, presenting the results of my researches in a  succession of volumes.    One of the first was devoted to the study of the psychological  laws of the evolution of peoples.  Having shown that the  historic races--that is, the races formed by the hazards of  history--finally acquired psychological characteristics as stable  as their anatomical characteristics, I attempted to explain how a  people transforms its institutions, its languages, and its arts.  I explained in the same work why it was that individual  personalities, under the influence of sudden variations of  environment, might be entirely disaggregated.    But besides the fixed collectivities formed by the peoples, there  are mobile and transitory collectivities known as crowds.  Now  these crowds or mobs, by the aid of which the great movements of  history are accomplished, have characteristics absolutely  different from those of the individuals who compose them.  What  are these characteristics, and how are they evolved?  This new  problem was examined in The Psychology of the Crowd.    Only after these studies did I begin to perceive certain  influences which had escaped me.    But this was not all.  Among the most important factors of  history one was preponderant--the factor of beliefs.  How are  these beliefs born, and are they really rational and voluntary,  as was long taught?  Are they not rather unconscious and  independent of all reason?  A difficult question, which I dealt  with in my last book, Opinions and Beliefs.    So long as psychology regards beliefs as voluntary and rational  they will remain inexplicable.  Having proved that they are  usually irrational and always involuntary, I was able to propound  the solution of this important problem; how it was that beliefs  which no reason could justify were admitted without  difficulty by the most enlightened spirits of all ages.    The solution of the historical difficulties which had so long  been sought was thenceforth obvious.  I arrived at the conclusion  that beside the rational logic which conditions thought, and was  formerly regarded as our sole guide, there exist very different  forms of logic: affective logic, collective logic, and mystic  logic, which usually overrule the reason and engender the  generative impulses of our conduct.    This fact well established, it seemed to me evident that if a  great number of historical events are often uncomprehended, it is  because we seek to interpret them in the light of a logic which  in reality has very little influence upon their genesis.      All these researches, which are here summed up in a few lines,  demanded long years for their accomplishment.  Despairing of  completing them, I abandoned them more than once to return to  those labours of the laboratory in which one is always sure of  skirting the truth and of acquiring fragments at least of  certitude.    But while it is very interesting to explore the world of material  phenomena, it is still more so to decipher men, for which reason  I have always been led back to psychology.    Certain principles deduced from my researches appearing likely to  prove fruitful, I resolved to apply them to the study of concrete  instances, and was thus led to deal with the Psychology of  Revolutions--notably that of the French Revolution.    Proceeding in the analysis of our great Revolution, the  greater part of the opinions determined by the reading of books  deserted me one by one, although I had considered them  unshakable.    To explain this period we must consider it as a whole, as many  historians have done.  It is composed of phenomena simultaneous  but independent of one another.    Each of its phases reveals events engendered by psychological  laws working with the regularity of clockwork.  The actors in  this great drama seem to move like the characters of a previously  determined drama.  Each says what he must say, acts as he is  bound to act.    To be sure, the actors in the revolutionary drama differed from  those of a written drama in that they had not studied their  parts, but these were dictated by invisible forces.    Precisely because they were subjected to the inevitable  progression of logics incomprehensible to them we see them as  greatly astonished by the events of which they were the heroes as  are we ourselves.  Never did they suspect the invisible powers  which forced them to act.  They were the masters neither of their  fury nor their weakness.  They spoke in the name of reason,  pretending to be guided by reason, but in reality it was by no  means reason that impelled them.    ``The decisions for which we are so greatly reproached,'' wrote  Billaud-Varenne, ``were more often than otherwise not intended or  desired by us two days or even one day beforehand: the crisis  alone evoked them.''    Not that we must consider the events of the Revolution as  dominated by an imperious fatality.  The readers of our works  will know that we recognise in the man of superior qualities the  role of averting fatalities.  But he can dissociate himself  only from a few of such, and is often powerless before the  sequence of events which even at their origin could scarcely be  ruled.  The scientist knows how to destroy the microbe before it  has time to act, but he knows himself powerless to prevent the  evolution of the resulting malady.      When any question gives rise to violently contradictory opinions  we may be sure that it belongs to the province of beliefs and not  to that of knowledge.    We have shown in a preceding work that belief, of unconscious  origin and independent of all reason, can never be influenced by  reason.    The Revolution, the work of believers, has seldom been judged by  any but believers.  Execrated by some and praised by others, it  has remained one of those dogmas which are accepted or rejected  as a whole, without the intervention of rational logic.    Although in its beginnings a religious or political revolution  may very well be supported by rational elements, it is developed  only by the aid of mystic and affective elements which are  absolutely foreign to reason.    The historians who have judged the events of the French  Revolution in the name of rational logic could not comprehend  them, since this form of logic did not dictate them.  As the  actors of these events themselves understood them but ill, we  shall not be far from the truth in saying that our  Revolution was a phenomenon equally misunderstood by those  who caused it and by those who have described it.  At no period  of history did men so little grasp the present, so greatly ignore  the past, and so poorly divine the future.      . . . The power of the Revolution did not reside in the  principles--which for that matter were anything but novel--which  it sought to propagate, nor in the institutions which it sought  to found.  The people cares very little for institutions and even  less for doctrines.  That the Revolution was potent indeed, that  it made France accept the violence, the murders, the ruin and the  horror of a frightful civil war, that finally it defended itself  victoriously against a Europe in arms, was due to the fact that  it had founded not a new system of government but a new religion.    Now history shows us how irresistible is the might of a strong  belief.  Invincible Rome herself had to bow before the armies of  nomad shepherds illuminated by the faith of Mahommed.  For the  same reason the kings of Europe could not resist the  tatterdemalion soldiers of the Convention.  Like all apostles,  they were ready to immolate themselves in the sole end of  propagating their beliefs, which according to their dream were to  renew the world.    The religion thus founded had the force of other religions, if  not their duration.  Yet it did not perish without leaving  indelible traces, and its influence is active still.
