In 1860 Peters described  and figured as a new genus and species, _Conophis vittatus_, based on  a specimen that he had obtained from a dealer in Hamburg. The  provenance of this specimen is not known, for it was discovered aboard  a ship near the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was not until 1871  that Cope included _lineatus_ in the genus _Conophis_. Cope (1861)  proposed the name _Conophis vittatus_ (_nec_ Peters, 1860). Later  (1900) he changed its name to _Conophis lineaticeps_. Early  uncertainty of the relationships of the species _lineatus_ caused  Guenther (1858) to place it in the genus _Psammophis_. With the  exception of Garman (1884a and 1884b) who placed _lineatus_ in the  genus _Tachymenis_, and Wettstein (1934) who reported five specimens  of _Conophis nevermanni_ as _Coniophanes i. imperialis_, all specimens  reported after 1876 were placed in the genus _Conophis_.    The only previous attempt to review the systematics of this genus was  made by Smith (1941) who based his study primarily on specimens in the  United States National Museum. He examined only 28 specimens,  including none of one species (_nevermanni_).    _Description._--Hemipenis slightly bifurcate having forked sulcus  spermaticus, large spines near base, and smaller spines or papillae on  flounces nearer apices; prediastemal maxillary teeth 8-12, subequal in  length, and followed by short diastema and one enlarged fang or two;  fangs grooved, only one functional at any one time, unless snake is in  process of shedding teeth; teeth 6-10 on palatine, 15 to 19 on  pterygoid, 15 to 21 on dentary; teeth on dentary decreasing in size  posteriorly; large parotid (venom) gland on either side of head in  temporal region; head shields of basically unmodified colubrid type  excepting decurved rostral; rostral concave below and therein modified  for burrowing; internasals and prefrontals paired; nasals divided;  loreal single; preocular one, rarely two; postoculars, two;  supralabials, 7-8, 3rd and 4th or 4th and 5th under eye; infralabials,  8-11, usually 9 or 10; temporals, normally 1 plus 2 plus 3;  chin-shields subequal in length; ventrals, 149-183, rounded and  overlapping; caudals, 55-89, paired and imbricate; anal divided;  dorsal scales smooth and in 19 rows at mid-body with no apical pits  or keels; scale reduction normally involving fusion of 3rd and 4th  rows, resulting in 17 scale-rows near tail; tail length more than 20  per cent of body length; maximum total length exceeding 1.1 meters;  dorsal color pattern consisting of dark stripes, or no darkening, on  paler ground-color; ventral surfaces immaculate pale yellowish or  white, except on specimens having single lateral dark spots on some or  all ventrals; pupil round; diurnal or crepuscular; feeding primarily  on small lizards, sometimes on small mammals or other snakes.    _Distribution._--Semi-arid regions of southern Mexico and Central  America as far south as Costa Rica.      KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES    Although many juveniles differ greatly in general coloration from the  adults, both the juveniles and the adults of any species or subspecies  can be identified from the following key; juveniles differ from adults  in extent and intensity of dark pigmentation but not in rows of scales  involved.     1. Seven supralabials (3rd and 4th below orbit); 3 to 8 dark      stripes along body                                               2        Eight supralabials (4th and 5th below orbit); unstriped or with      more than 4 dark stripes along body, or dark with 2 or 4 pale      stripes                                                          3     2. Dark stripes involving no more than one longitudinal      scale-row                    _C. lineatus lineatus_ (part), p. 267        Dark stripes involving at least two adjacent scale-rows                                                   _C. vittatus_, p. 277     3. Supralabials having black borders above; head and body      generally black with 2 or 4 white lines running length      of body                                    _C. nevermanni_, p. 272        Supralabials immaculate or having dark borders below; head      and body usually pale with dark stripes, or without stripes      4     4. Lateral dark stripe through eye involving upper half of second      scale-row; dark stripe on paravertebral row, at least      posteriorly                                   _C. pulcher_, p. 274        Lateral dark stripe becoming indistinct on body, or restricted      to 4th or 3rd and 4th rows anteriorly, not involving 2nd      scale-row on anterior 1/3 of body (an auxiliary lateral stripe      sometimes present involving 2nd row); no paravertebral stripes   5     5. Stripes disappearing posteriorly (except for small spots of      pigment on scale-row 4 or 7); 1st scale-row unpigmented                                          _C. lineatus concolor_, p. 270        Stripes present posteriorly; 1st scale-row pigmented             6     6. Lateral stripes narrow on nape, restricted to 4th scale-row      on body                      _C. lineatus lineatus_ (part), p. 267        Lateral stripes involving 3rd and 4th rows, at least on      nape                                   _C. lineatus dunni_, p. 262      Analysis of Characters    Characters showing inter-specific and intra-specific variation and  that have a wide range of variation were analyzed statistically, when  possible, in order to determine extent of variation. One character  (see table 3) was analyzed for sexual dimorphism, and for it the  coefficient of difference is also given. The statistical terms and  formulae have been adopted from Mayr, Linsley and Usinger (1953).  Dorsal head shields varied individually and were of no taxonomic  importance. Osteological and hemipeneal characters did not show enough  variation to be considered here.      Scutellation    Labials, dorsals, ventrals, and subcaudals were the most useful  scales.    _Labials._--All species usually have eight supralabials except _C.  vittatus_, which has seven. The only other population having a  relatively high frequency of occurrence of seven supralabials is _C.  l. lineatus_. In specimens having eight supralabials, the fourth and  fifth enter the orbit; in specimens having seven supralabials, the  third and fourth enter the orbit (the second and third are fused).  Usually there are ten infralabials, sometimes nine or eleven;  specimens having seven supralabials usually have nine infralabials,  sometimes eight, rarely ten.    _Dorsals._--Although there is no variation in the number of rows of  dorsal scales, there is some in the method of scale reduction. There  are 19 rows of dorsal scales from close behind the head to about  midway on the body where two rows are lost, leaving 17 rows from there  to near the base of the tail. This reduction is accomplished by fusion  of the scales of the 3rd and 4th rows or sometimes by the dropping out  of the 3rd row. The place at which reduction occurs in number of  dorsal scales in relation to the ventral (scale) directly below is  highly variable and of little taxonomic importance (table 1).

In  some populations there is no overlap in the range of variation of  males and females. The total variation and sexual dimorphism are  analyzed in table 3.      Size and Proportions    Although considerable variation in size is observable, little  taxonomic use is made of size since sufficient series are not  available to determine age classes. The subspecies attaining the  largest size is _C. lineatus concolor_; all others are smaller and of  about the same size and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37530"],[0,"The Story of an Ostrich: An Allegory and Humorous Satire in Rhyme. (#2)"],[1,"ways. As \"the mere  grasses,\" priests and kings have trampled upon the masses--have been at  once their masters, their deities and interpreters of deity. Their rank  materialism has always complacently overrated itself, while the world,  which labors and runs, has ever been chained to and crushed beneath it.  Man knew not the power of God within himself.      _II._    Many unthinking as well as vicious men, in both ancient and modern  times, who have by accident of birth and condition been set in authority  over their fellows, or, who have by their own efforts been raised to  positions of power and responsibility in the state and among the great  captains of industry, have thought to ignore their dependence upon the  lower orders of society for the very altitude they have enjoyed--the  head refusing, as it were, to consider the feet as a part of the body  corporate and entitled to no more than the pleasure of mere existence.  Such heads apply no healing balms to weak and wounded      [Illustration]        Although, from his youth up, they'd always been going,      His mental inertia prevented his knowing      That all lofty heads must have good understanding,      To retain, out of hand, a position commanding;      So, he would still peck, though it hurt, and despise them,      And swear, by the gods, he would not recognise them!        But those homely feet, which for long had done duty:      Mid lowly conditions, lay'ng no claim to beauty      Of pinion, or plume, yet upholding together      The framework of bone, with its blood, flesh and feather,--      The which makes an ostrich of wit and assurance,--      At last reached the limit of patient endurance.        They turned about, then,--the proverbial worm,--      And punched his head hard,--to use a slang term;      So forceful and rapid they got in their work,      The ostrich, in agony, let out a \"quirk!\"      As, weakened by suff'ring, disheartened by pain,      A hint of the truth dawned upon his dull brain.    [Illustration]        Self-centred, astounded, indignant, demented,      The ostrich, not yet half acquainted, resented      The silent upheaval, he'd felt, of the masses,      He'd, heretofore, held to be as the mere grasses;      They having objected, he'd make no contention,      Though he wondered how he'd interpose intervention      Enough to protect him from any more kicking      Like that, which was, now, in his mem'ry still sticking.        Overwhelmed with emotion he could not command,      The hurt ostrich buried his head in the sand,--      Away from his sight shut his two mangled feet out,      Lest they his own ostrich fool brains should quite beat out,--      Thus hiding himself, as he thought, in his shame,      From the world, though he still stood revealed just the same.        'Twas then a near neighbor, who'd watched with close scrutiny,      The clumsy feet operate during the mutiny,      Interfered to propose they adopt arbitration,      And settle their difference with more moderation.      extremities, but proffer, instead, the scourge, _i.e._, starvation, long  days of poorly remunerated toil, squalid surroundings,--in ancient times  the guillotine, the gallows and the rack; in modern days, ostracism, the  prison and the electric chair. The blood of Christ's divinity flowed  that love and mercy might be exemplified, but it cannot sprinkle the  world with saving grace, so long as its own herald, the church,  continues to say, \"Amen!\" to the master, and \"Peace, be still!\" to the  slave.    When there crept into the world the first dull, unreasoning sense of  injury,--when the underlings of humanity first began to assimilate from  the common vein of intelligence that made them one with the body, a  sensible desire for recognition on the ground of equality, they were  promptly denied any part whatsoever in the material and spiritual  accretions of generations of labor; and then was inaugurated the revolt  that has been prolific through all past time, of war and misery, of  violence, pillage and murder.      _III._    In the light of experience the heads of humanity have seldom profited by  the tutelage of whips and blood and torture. Without respect for rights  and demands when opposed to their selfish material interests, they have  held not their Bibles in their hands, where the light might illumine its  pages, but have placed the sacred book under their feet while making  prayers to stocks and bonds.    But the knights-errant are in the saddle, and with the true spirit of  knighthood they may be found in the thick of the politic battle, where  they are making clear the path for greater powers that shall follow with  purging force to cleanse the great body and through a long and cruel  strife establish the contentious parts in truth and unity.      _IV._    Mighty powers of the state are asleep at the post of duty, when, lo! an  issue arises,--the mice are in the government meal-bag,--the spirits of  fire and distraction are abroad; wealth and power are being attacked  from beneath! The great hand of the law reaches forth to seize upon the  offender and to snuff out his little, palpitating human life, that, far  from being the cause, is only a symptom of the real malady. The cause  still exists, the cancer of the state still invites new vermin to feed  upon its sore.      [Illustration]        \"Observe,\" said the neighbor, \"your gesticulations,      Your dearth of debate and gymnastic gyrations      Encroach, with a frequency highly alarming,      Upon my estate, which I value for farming;      If your two extremities keep on contending,      Bye and bye, we shall have nothing left worth defending.\"        The plan was considered by all the combatants,--      In silence the feet, by the head's usual blatance,      Which presently muttered, \"I may yet surprise you!\"      And mentally uttered, \"I'll not recognize you!\"      But agreed, after all, with becoming alacrity,      Despite the bald fact that both feet were still there, gritty      And soiled with innumerable days of hard working,      Transporting their load overland without shirking.        Then a toad, a sly fox, a snail, peacock and hatter,      Turned-to to investigate what was the matter;      Selecting a sand-pit within which to meet,      They invited the ostrich to come,--with his feet,    [Illustration]        And tell how it happened the quarrel arose,      Which, they'd been informed, culminated in blows.        The peacock was asked to preside at the hearing,      Decide the disputes, in despite of the jeering      That, betimes, with his rulings, increased to a gale,      When he, perchance, winked with the eyes of his tail.        The ostrich appeared and made the assertion,      In voluble language of animadversion,      That, while he'd been, quietly, minding his business,      His damp, dirty feet had occasioned him dizziness,      Obtruding each, vulgarly, on his attention,      Thereby, in so doing, creating contention--      \"I' faith, 'pon my word,\" the ostrich said, squawking,      \"I fear me, each wants a kid shoe and silk stocking.\"        At this point, the peacock his tail feathers flaunted;      The ostrich, however, continued undaunted,--      \"I know of no reason for this state of things,      Nor why my two feet should expect, by their flings,      The knight prophesies and expostulates in the public ear, but Uncle Sam  still sleeps, though perchance with uneasy dreams. The great forces  which evolve the tramp and the ignorant emigrant are still at work,  while the devil holds the match to the combustible elements of soulless  greed. Bye and bye there will be a great hue and cry of fire, with much  ringing of bells.      _V._    Uncle Sam is now awake and doing in earnest. The rankness of materialism  breeding from the earth, a thing of great and dreaded power, of craft  and slime, recoils upon the land of which it has been begotten and now  boldly erects its head to encompass the state in its death-constricting  coils.    Even the old lady, who is wont to knit her stockings in peace by a  hardwood fire, or by the glowing coals of an open grate, in city or  town, alike, peaceful and content, and without consideration of the  vexing problems of supply and demand, awakens suddenly to the fact that  even a comfortable competence is no surety against want and cold, when  the serpent has dragged himself into the garden and garner house of  God.    The farmer is aroused and indignant, but when he makes his protest, the  serpent flies pursuit, and with a changing policy under the guise of a  great, foolish bird and a well assumed air of innocence, buries its  small and crafty head for a season in the sand.      _VI._    Really, it seems ridiculous that this incessant warfare of man against  man should go on,--the head casting aspersions upon the feet, and the  feet kicking against their own head, to the mutual affliction of  themselves and the great body that holds them together in the firm  compact of common life.... This is not God's law, but man's supreme  selfishness,--his disobedience and his curse. After all, kid shoes and  silk stockings are not elective privileges; and poorer humanity, turning  under its cross and chains, appeals to Heaven, not in vain, if we read  aright the signs of the times. The air resounds with optimistic  teachings and words of love and cheer that, as yet, have no guarantee in  actual deeds. In contra-distinction to the Christian creed, \"we must  look out for ourselves,\" is the rasping gospel of our latter-day faith.      [Illustration]        To dictate to me with whom I shall travel,      Annoy me by constantly scratching the gravel,      And trench on my courtesy, when I decline,      For reasons sufficient, to treat them as mine;      Please notice, your honors, their mode of attack,--      I hold they've no grievance and shouldn't kick back!\"        While the ostrich was talking, in tones hoarse and"]]]
