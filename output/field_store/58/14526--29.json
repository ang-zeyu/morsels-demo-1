To remove pecan meats whole, pour boiling water over nuts and let them  stand until cold. Then stand the nut on end and crack with a hammer,  striking the small end of the nut.    If beef or mutton drippings are used in making a pie-crust, beat them to  a cream with a teaspoonful of baking-powder and the juice of half a  lemon. This effectually removes all taste.    When a cake sticks to a pan, set it for a few minutes on a cloth wrung  out of cold water. It will then come out in good shape.    Heat the blade of the bread-knife before cutting a loaf of fresh bread.  This prevents the usual breaking and crumbling of the slices. For  cutting hot fudge, first dip the blade of the knife in boiling water.    Nothing is better for pudding molds than jelly tumblers with light tin  covers. One can readily tell when the puddings are done without removing  the covers.    The juice will not boil out of apple or berry pies if you dot bits of  Swift's Premium Oleomargarine near the outer edge.    A little salt in the oven under the baking-tins will prevent burning on  the bottom.    There is nothing more effective for removing the burned crust from cake  or bread than a flat grater. It works evenly and leaves a smooth  surface.    Use a wooden potato masher for stirring butter and sugar together for a  cake. It is much quicker than a spoon.    {Footer: Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is sweet, pure, and clean.}          Renovating Suggestions      TO CLEAN A VELVET SUIT, sponge the spots with pure alcohol. Then suspend  the suit on a hanger in the bathroom in such a way that the air can  reach all sides of the garment. Turn on the hot water in the tub until  the steam fills the room; shut the door and windows; shut off the water,  and let the steam do its work for an hour. Then admit the air, but do  not touch the garment until it is perfectly dry.    TO REMOVE SHINE FROM WOOLEN GOODS, use gentle friction with emery paper.  Rub just enough to raise the nap, and then rub it over with a piece of  silk.    TO MEND KID GLOVES, first buttonhole around the rent not so close as in  a buttonhole; then overcast, taking up the thread of the buttonhole on  the edge, and then draw together.    TO CLEAN MEN'S COAT COLLARS, rub with a black stocking saturated with  grain alcohol. This will remove the greasy look.    TO FRESHEN A THIN DRESS, dissolve two teaspoonfuls of elastic starch in  half a cupful of lukewarm water, and with a soft rag dampen on the right  side, then with a hot iron press on the wrong side.    TO CLEAN GREASE SPOTS FROM SILK, split a visiting card and rub the soft  internal part on the spot on the wrong side of the silk. The spot will  disappear without taking the gloss off the silk.    TO MEND LACE CURTAINS, take a small piece of net, dip it and the  curtains in hot starch, and apply the patch over the hole. The patch  will adhere when dry, and the repair will show much less than if the  curtains were mended.    TO RENEW VEILS, dip them in gum-arabic water, and pin them out to dry as  you would a lace curtain. When dry they will look like new.    TO FRESHEN BLACK TAFFETA OR SATIN, sponge with a cupful of strong tea to  which a little ammonia has been added. Then press on the wrong side over  a damp cloth.    TO REMOVE PERSPIRATION STAINS, lay the stain over clean white  blotting-paper, and sponge with equal parts of alcohol and ether mixed.  Rub dry, then touch lightly with household ammonia. If this leaves a  blur, rub well with powdered French chalk on the wrong side. The  blotting-paper prevents the fluids from forming a ring around the spot.          House-Cleaning Hints and Helps      TO CLEAN LINEN SHADES, lay them flat and rub with powdered bath-brick.    TO CLEAN PIANO KEYS, rub with muslin dipped in alcohol. If the keys are  very yellow, use a piece of flannel moistened with cologne water.    TO CLEAN BOOKS with delicate bindings, which are soiled from handling,  rub with chamois skin dipped in powdered pumice stone.    TO RESTORE STRAW MATTING which has become stained or faded, wash with a  strong solution of soda water. Use ordinary baking soda and plenty of  Swift's Pride Soap and wash thoroughly, and when dry it will be found  that the spots have all disappeared and the matting is all one color.    TO CLEAN GLASS VASES, tea-leaves moistened with vinegar will remove the  discoloration in glass vases caused by flowers, such as asters.    TO CLEAN WINDOWS AND MIRRORS, rub them over with thin cold starch, let  it dry on, and then wipe off with a soft cloth. This will clean the  glass and also give it a brilliant polish.    TO REMOVE PAINT from window glass, use strong hot vinegar.    TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, and then with  slightly diluted alcohol.    TO REMOVE STAINS from an enameled saucepan, fill with water, add a  little chloride of lime, and boil for a few minutes.    TO CLEAN WILLOW-WARE, wash with salt water, using a brush.    TO POLISH THE GLOBES of gas and electric-light fixtures, wash with water  in which a few drops of ammonia have been dissolved.    TO CLEAN TILING, wipe with a soft cloth wrung out in soapy water. Never  scrub tiling, as scrubbing or the use of much water will eventually  loosen the cement and dislodge the sections.    TO BRIGHTEN NICKEL trimmings on a gas stove, wash with warm water, in  which two tablespoonfuls of kerosene have been stirred.    TO SAVE DUSTING, a piece of cheese cloth about two yards long placed on  the floor in a freshly swept room will save much of the usual dusting.          Laundry Helps      A few cents' worth of powdered orris-root put in the wash water will  impart a delicate odor to the clothes.    Hot milk is better than hot water to remove fruit stains.    To remove spots from gingham, wet with milk and cover with common salt.  Leave for two hours, then rinse thoroughly.    In washing white goods that have become yellow, put a few drops of  turpentine into the water, then lay on the grass to dry in the strong  sunshine.    To make wash silk look like new, put a tablespoonful of wood alcohol to  every quart of water when rinsing and iron while still damp.    When washing, if the article is badly soiled, use a small scrubbing  brush and scrub the goods over the washboard.    To set green or blue, mauve or purple, soak the articles for at least  ten minutes in alum water before washing them. Use an ounce of alum to a  gallon of water. To set brown or tan color, soak for ten minutes in a  solution made of a cupful of vinegar in a pail of water. Black goods and  black-and-white goods need to be soaked in strong salt water, or to have  a cupful of turpentine put into the wash water. Yellows, buffs, and tans  are made much brighter by having a cupful of strong, strained coffee put  in the rinsing water.    When ironing fine pieces, instead of sprinkling afresh, take a piece of  muslin, wring it out in cold water, and lay on the ironing board under  the article; press with a warm iron; remove the wet piece and iron.    When making starch for light clothes use Wool Soap in the water. This  will give the clothes a glossy appearance and the irons will not stick.    Badly scorched linen may be improved by using the following solution:  Boil together well a pint of vinegar, an ounce of Wool Soap, four ounces  of fuller's earth, and the juice of two onions. Spread this solution  over the scorched spots on the linen and let it dry. Afterward wash the  garment and the scorch will disappear.    To keep the clothes-line from twisting, hold the ball of rope in one  hand and wind with the other until a twist appears; then change ball to  the other hand and the twist will disappear. Keep doing this, changing  the rope from one hand to the other until the line is all wound up.          About House Plants      To make ferns grow better, place some thin pieces of raw beef close to  the inside of the pot, between the pot and the soil.    Old-fashioned portulaca makes a pretty low-growing green for a fern  dish.    To prevent plants from dropping their buds, give extra good drainage and  systematic but moderate watering.    An infallible wash for destroying the scaly insects that infest house  plants is made as follows: Place half a bar of Swift's Pride Laundry  Soap in a deep saucer and pour kerosene around it. Let this stand for  about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil. Then make a strong  lather of this soap and with it wash the plants. After which spray them  with clear water until clean.    To destroy aphis, shower foliage of infested plant on both sides with  strong tobacco tea, or, if the plant be small enough, immerse it in this  tea.    Insects in the earth of a potted plant may be destroyed by pouring over  the soil a glass of water in which a pinch of mustard has been stirred.    If an asparagus fern turns yellow, repot it, giving it a strong loam  enriched with one-fifth very old and finely crumbed manure and add a  little coarse sand. Give the fern only an hour or two of sunlight each  day. Water when it looks dry, but do not let it stand in any water that  may have run through into the saucer.    Before putting plants in a wooden window box whitewash the inside of the  box. This not only keeps the box from rotting, but prevents insects.    If sprays of growing nasturtiums are broken off in the late summer and  placed in a bowl of water they will root and grow all winter.          How to Use the Cheaper Cuts of Meat      Much time has been given in the last few years to the study of foods,  their necessary proportions, and the manner of cooking them. Educators  and scientists have alike agreed that this knowledge ought to be  disseminated. On the part of the public also there has been a general  awakening in this regard. There has been a wide demand especially from  those of limited incomes for information on the purchase and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33766"],[0,"History of Phosphorus (#2)"],[1,"it enters the  human system through the plant food, to be excreted later in the urine.  He did not convince all the chemists with his reasoning. In 1789,  Macquer wrote: \"There are some who, even at this time, hold that the  phosphorical ('phosphorische') acid generates itself in the animals and  who consider this to be the 'animalistic acid.'\"[7]    Although Marggraf was more advanced in his arguments than these  chemists, yet he was a child of his time. The luminescent and  combustible, almost wax-like substance impressed him greatly. \"My  thoughts about the unexpected generation of light and fire out of water,  fine earth, and phlogiston I reserve to describe at a later time.\" These  thoughts went so far as to connect the new marvel with alchemical wonder  tales. When Marggraf used the \"essential salt of urine,\" also called  _sal microcosmicum_, and admixed silver chloride (\"horny silver\") to it  for the distillation of phosphorus, he expected \"a partial conversion of  silver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable earth, but no trace  of a more noble metal appeared.\"[8]    Robert Boyle had already found that the burning of phosphorus produced  an acid. He identified it by taste and by its influence on colored plant  extracts serving as \"indicators.\" Hankwitz[9] described methods for  obtaining this acid, and Marggraf showed its chemical peculiarities.  They did not necessarily establish phosphorus as a new element. To do  that was not as important, at that time, as to conjecture on analogies  with known substances. Underlying all its unique characteristics was the  analogy of phosphorus with sulfur. Like sulfur, phosphorus can burn in  two different ways, either slowly or more violently, and form two  different acids. The analogy can, therefore, be extended to explain the  results in both groups in the same way. In the process of burning, the  combustible component is removed, and the acid originally combined with  the combustible is set free. Whether the analogy should be pursued even  further remained doubtful, although some suspicion lingered on for a  while that phosphoric acid might actually be a modified sulfuric acid.  Analogies and suspicions like these were needed to formulate new  questions and stimulate new experiments. They are cited here for their  important positive value in the historical development, and not for the  purpose of showing how wrong these chemists were from our point of  view, a point of view which they helped to create.    The widespread interest in the burning of sulfur and of phosphorus,  naturally, caught Lavoisier's attention. In his first volume of  _Opuscules Physiques et Chimiques_ (1774), he devoted 20 pages to his  experiments on phosphorus. He amplified them a few years later[10] when  he attributed the combustion to a combination of phosphorus with the  \"eminently respirable\" part of air. In the _Methode de Nomenclature  Chimique_ of 1787, the column of \"undecomposed substances\" lists sulfur  as the \"radical sulfurique,\" and phosphorus, correspondingly, as the  \"radical phosphorique.\" The acids are now shown to be compounds of the  \"undecomposed\" radicals, the complete reversion of the previous concept  of this relationship. A part of the old analogy remained as far as the  acids are concerned: sulfuric acid corresponds to phosphoric; sulfurous  acid to phosphorous acid with less oxygen than in the former.[11]          Early Uses      In the 18th century, phosphorus was a costly material. It was produced  mostly for display and to satisfy curiosity. Guillaume Francois Rouelle  (1703-1770) demonstrated the process in his lectures, and, as Macquer  reports, he \"very often\" succeeded in making it.[12] Robert Boyle had  the idea of using phosphorus as a light for underwater divers.[13] A  century later, \"instant lights\" were sold, with molten phosphorus as the  \"igniter,\" but they proved cumbersome and unreliable.[14] Because white  phosphorus is highly poisonous, an active development of the use in  matches occurred only after the conversion of the white modification  into the red had been studied by Emile Kopp (1844), by Wilhelm Hittorf  (1824-1914) and, in its practical application, by Anton Schroetter  (1802-1875).[15]    [Illustration: Figure 3.--DISTILLATION APPARATUS (1849) for refining  crude phosphorus. The crude phosphorus is mixed with sand under hot  water, cooled, drained, and filled into the retort. The outlet of the  retort, at least 6 cm. in diameter, is partially immersed in the water  contained in the bucket. A small dish, made from lead, with an iron  handle, receives the distilled phosphorus. (From HUGO FLECK, _Die  Fabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._ page 90.)]    The most exciting early use, however, was in medicine. It is not  surprising that such a use was sought at that time. Any new material  immediately became the hope of ailing mankind--and of striving  inventors.[16] Phosphorus was prescribed, in liniments with fatty oils  or as solution in alcohol and ether, for external and internal  application. A certain Dr. Kramer found it efficient against epilepsy  and melancholia (1730). A Professor Hartmann recommended it against  cramps.[17] However, in the growing production of phosphorus for  matches, the workers experienced the poisonous effects. In the plant of  Black and Bell at Stratford, this was prevented by inhaling turpentine.  Experiments on dogs were carried out to show that poisoning by  phosphorus could be remedied through oil of turpentine.[18]    [Illustration: Figure 4.--APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING WHITE PHOSPHORUS into  the red allotropic form, 1851. Redistilled phosphorus is heated in the  glass or porcelain vessel (g) which is surrounded by a sandbath (e) and  a metal bath (b). Vessel (j) is filled with mercury and water; together  with valve (k), it serves as a safety device. The alcohol lamp (l) keeps  the tube warm against clogging by solidified vapors. Because of hydrogen  phosphides, the operation, carried out at 260 deg. C., had to be watched  very carefully. (According to Arthur Albright, 1851; reproduced from  HUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._, page 112.)]          Chemical Constitution of Phosphoric Acids      In a long article on phosphorus, Edmond Willm wrote in 1876: \"For a  century, urine was the only source from which phosphorus was obtained.  After Gahn, in 1769, recognized the presence of phosphoric acid in  bones, Scheele indicated the procedure for making phosphorus from  them.\"[19] Actually, Gahn used at first hartshorn (_Cornu cervi  ustum_), and Scheele doubted, until he checked it himself, that his  esteemed friend was right. A few years later, Scheele corrected Gahn's  assumption that the _sal microcosmicum_ was an ammonia salt; instead, it  is \"a tertiary neutral salt, consisting of _alkali minerali fixo_ (i.e.,  sodium), _alkali volatili_, and _acido phosphori_.\"[20]    In the years after 1770, phosphorus was discovered in bones and many  other parts of various animals. Treatment with sulfuric acid decomposed  these materials into a solid residue and dissolved phosphoric acid. Many  salts of this acid were produced in crystalline form. Heat resistance  had been considered one of the outstanding characteristics of phosphoric  acid. Now, however, in the processes of drying and heating certain  phosphates, it became clear that three kinds of phosphoric acids could  be produced: _ortho_, _pyro_, and _meta_.    Berzelius cited these acids as examples of compounds which are ISOMERIC.  This word was intended to designate compounds which contain the same  number of atoms of the same elements but combined in different manners,  thereby explaining their different chemical properties and crystal  forms. It was in 1830 that Berzelius propounded this companion of the  concept, ISOMORPHISM, which was to collect all cases of equal crystal  form in compounds in which equal numbers of atoms of different elements  are put together in the same manner. Together, the two concepts of  isomerism and isomorphism seemed to cover all the known exceptions from  the simplest assumption as to specificity and chemical composition.    However, only a few years later Thomas Graham (1805-1869) proved that  the three phosphoric acids are not isomeric. He used the proportion of 2  P to 5 O in the oxide which Berzelius had thought justified at least  until \"an example of the contrary could be sufficiently  established.\"[21] Refining the techniques of Gay-Lussac (1816) and  several other investigators, Graham characterized the three phosphoric  acids as \"a terphosphate, a biphosphate, and phosphate of water.\"  Actually, this was the wrong terminology for what he meant and  formulated as trihydrate, bihydrate, and monohydrate of phosphorus  oxide. In his manner of writing the formulas, each dot over the symbol  for the element was to indicate an atom of oxygen; thus, he wrote:        ...   :: ..   ...    . .      H^{3} P  H^{2} P and H P.[22]    [Illustration: Figure 5.--OVEN FOR THE CALCINATION OF BONES, about 1870.  \"The operation is carried out in a rather high oven, such as shown....  The fresh bones are thrown in at the top of the oven, B. First, fuel in  chamber F is lighted, and a certain quantity of bones is burnt on the  grid D. When these bones are burning well, the oven is gradually filled  with bones, and the combustion maintains itself without addition of  other fuel. A circular gallery, C, surrounds the bottom of the oven and  carries the products of combustion into the chimney, H. The calcined  bones are taken out at the lower opening, G, by removing the bars of  grid B.\" (Translation of the description from FIGUIER, _Merveilles de  l'industrie_, volume 3, 1874, page 537.)]    [Illustration: Figure 6.--AN ADVERTISEMENT with view of plant for  manufacturing superphosphate about 1867.
