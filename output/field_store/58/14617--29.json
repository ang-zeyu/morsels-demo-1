Whether this act was connected with the  hunger of the wasps themselves or with the first development of the  instinct of feeding the larvae in the nest, which Miss Enteman says  begins without imitation, is not clear.    At 2 p. m. (two hours later) the colony was placed out of doors, still  on the book. Two of the wasps soon left the latter, and settled near  it, keeping very quiet for half an hour. The third kept climbing over  and around the nest. At 2:30 one of the two wasps returned to the nest.    At 3 p. m. two of the specimens were on the ground near the porch. They  made only short flights, resembling jumps with the wings assisting,  this being true even when they were disturbed. The third wasp was  beside the colony, chewing on the decapitated pupa, probably getting  some nourishment from it in the process.    During the afternoon the nest was disturbed, and at 6 p. m. all three  specimens had gone from the porch. One was found wandering aimlessly on  a canna leaf near by. It did not seem to be able to fly well. The other  two had disappeared entirely.    The nest was saved and several days later a fourth wasp appeared. It  was a very lively specimen, and spent the first few hours actively  exploring the nest. It seemed of a very nervous disposition, being more  easily disturbed than any of the others had been. Every time the nest  was picked up, it would start for the fingers or forceps holding it. At  one time it was observed with its whole body in a cell, head downward,  evidently examining the interior. After staying close to the nest for a  day, it began to fly around the floor of the room, paying no more  attention to its former home. Even when it was placed on or near it, it  would almost immediately crawl or fly away. Its flying was erratic, and  seemed to lack power, but it got along much better than any of the  other three had done.    From the above observations it would appear that the movements of the  wasp recorded at one minute intervals after emergence from its cell  were probably reactions due to the discomfort of the drying and  hardening of the tissues. At first the wasps apparently had very  little, if any, home instinct. The only things to indicate that they  had any were the facts that the first specimen so readily left the cork  on which it was sitting and went back to its nest when the latter was  held near it, and the fourth wasp stayed on or near the nest for the  first twelve hours. But all the specimens observed left the nest the  first night and showed no intention or disposition to return. The  presence of a second wasp seemed to bring the home instinct into  existence more forcibly, as the first and second wasps stayed with the  nest for six or seven hours when they were returned to it together,  while the fourth one repeatedly left the empty nest almost at once when  it was returned to it. But this instinct was seemingly not very strong,  as they soon wandered away when placed out of doors. They seemed to  have no idea as to how to carry on the work of the colony, but wandered  aimlessly over it. Perhaps this was due to the fact that they were too  young, as Miss Enteman says the development of the nursing instinct is  usually manifested \"any time after the first half day of imaginal  life,\" but was observed in some neuters as young as four hours, while  in others it was delayed for two weeks.    While the above observations are admittedly too few from which to draw  definite conclusions, they seem to warrant the following assumptions,  the first three of which are quoted from Miss Enteman, and hence are  simply corroborative of her work:         1. \"All wasps possess the instinct of fear. This is          especially strong the first few days after emergence,          but is readily overcome by the frequent appearance of          the awe-inspiring object.         2. \"In a sense, the wasp remembers. This is indicated by the          manner in which it accustoms itself to the sight of          strange objects, and by its behavior when a change is          made in its nest or surroundings.         3. \"It shows considerable individual variability, both as to          time and manner of its response to stimuli.\"         4. After emergence, the first reactions are associated          simply with the discomfort of the hardening of the          tissues.         5. It has marked curiosity, as shown by its repeated          inspection of its nest and other familiar objects.         6. The \"home instinct\" seems to be slight when the wasp is          alone, but becomes stronger when two or more are on the          same nest.         7. The olfactory sense is closely associated with the early          instincts of the wasp.

ALEXANDER, Ph.D. (Cornell)      GENERIC DIAGNOSIS    _Larva._ Form very elongate, terete; integument smooth, glassy,  transparent; abdominal segments two to eight with a basal transverse  band or area of microscopic chitinized points on the ventral surface;  segment eight with a similar band on the dorsum. Spiracular disk  surrounded by four lobes, the lateral pair more slender than the blunt  ventral pair; dorsal lobe very low or lacking; spiracles small, widely  separated; a triangular brown mark on the disk between the spiracles;  anal gills a fleshy protuberant ring surrounding the anus. Head-capsule  compact, massive, the praefrons large with a few marginal punctures;  externo-lateral plates very broad. Labrum large, flattened, pale;  antennae two-segmented, the apical segment almost as long as the basal  segment, narrowed to the blunt tip; mandibles with a blunt dorsal and  two blunt ventral teeth; maxillae generalized in structure; hypopharynx  a rounded cushion; mentum deeply split behind but not completely  divided, with three principle teeth and a small lateral tooth on either  side.    _Pupa._ Cephalic crest low, depressed, setiferous; labrum tumid; labial  lobes oval, contiguous; antennal sheaths ending opposite the base of  the wing. Pronotal breathing-horns microscopic, represented only by  tiny triangular tubercles; mesonotum unarmed; wing-sheaths ending  opposite the middle of the third abdominal segment; leg-sheaths ending  opposite the base of the fifth abdominal segment, the tarsi terminating  on a level, or nearly so. Abdominal tergites and sternites each with  four transverse rows of microscopic setae; lateral spiracles on segments  two to seven.      DISCUSSION OF THE GENUS    The genus _Dicranoptycha_ was erected by Osten Sacken in 1860 (Proc.  Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. for 1859, p. 217). The genus includes a small  group of crane-flies with a Holarctic distribution, there being about  six species in North America and two, or possibly three, in Europe. As  I have indicated elsewhere, _D. signaticollis_ v.d.W. of Java is  undoubtedly a species of _Libnotes_. Of the American species, _D.  germana_ O.S. is characteristic of the Canadian life-zone of  northeastern America. _D. sobrina_ O.S. is widely distributed in the  United States and southern Canada, usually occurring in the  Transitional and Upper Austral life-zones. So far as known at present  it is the only species of the genus occurring on the Pacific slope. The  remaining American species (_nigripes_ O.S., _winnemana_ Alex.,  _tigrina_ Alex. and _minima_ Alex.) are Austral in distribution,  occurring in the southeastern and south central United States. A more  detailed account of the distribution of the species is given in another  paper by the writer which may be consulted (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.  Phila. for 1916, pp. 496, 497). All of the known species are generally  similar to one another in appearance and are separated by relatively  slight differences of size, color and structure.    Nothing has ever been written concerning the immature stages of this  peculiar group of crane-flies. The species described hereinafter were  reared at Lawrence, Kansas, and the general conditions under which they  occur may be briefly discussed:    North Hollow, on the Campus of the University of Kansas, is a typical  dry Austral woodland traversed by a small stream that is entirely dry  during the months of midsummer drought. The soil consists of a rich  black humus that is soft and mellow except during the period of  greatest dryness, being overlain by a varying depth of vegetable debris  and leaf-mold. It is in this relatively dry soil that the larvae of  _Dicranoptycha_ occur. The forest cover consists of Carolina poplar,  _Populus deltoides_ Marsh; black walnut, _Juglans nigra_ L., white elm,  _Ulmus americana_ L.; Kentucky coffee-tree, _Gymnocladus dioica_ (L.)  Koch; honey locust, _Gleditsia triacanthos_ L.; red bud, _Cercis  canadensis_ L.; yellow wood, _Cladrastis lutea_ (Mx.f.) Koch;  tree-of-heaven, _Ailanthus glandulosa_ Desf., etc. The principle shrubs  are the goose-berry, _Ribes gracile_ Mx.; poison ivy, _Rhus  Toxicodendron_ L.; wahoo, _Evonymus atropurpureus_ Jacq.; bladder-nut,  _Staphylea trifolia_ L.; coral-berry, _Symphoricarpos orbiculatus_  Moench.; blackberried elder, _Sambucus canadensis_ L., etc. The herbage  is made up of tall grasses, composites and, in the spring, the  all-dominant cleavers, _Galium_. In addition to the above, great  tangles of lianas (_Smilax_, _Vitis_, _Ampelopsis_, etc.) are found.    In situations such as the above these Austral species of  _Dicranoptycha_ spend their entire lives. The first larvae of _D.  winnemana_ were found here on March 20, 1918, by the writer and his  wife. At this time they were well grown (length 16 mm.; diameter 0.9  mm.). They occurred just beneath the cover of fallen leaves and other  debris in the upper layers of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#2)"],[1,"reams, ten to 60 feet in width; and clear,  deeply incised, gravel-bottomed streams, usually five to 30 feet in  width.    SAND-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--The Big Blue and Little Blue rivers represent  this kind of stream. The bottoms of these rivers consist almost  entirely of fine sand; nevertheless, their channels are primarily deep  and fairly uniform in width, rather than broad, shallow, and braided  as in the larger Kansas and Arkansas rivers in Kansas (Plate 11, Fig.  1). In the Big Blue River, gravel occurs rarely on riffles, and  gravel-rubble bottoms are found below dams (Plate 11, Fig. 2). The Big  Blue flows over a larger proportion of gravelly bottom than does the  Little Blue.    Big Blue River rises at about 1,800 feet above mean sea level and  joins the Kansas River at an elevation of 1,000 feet above m. s. l.  The average gradient is 2.8 feet per mile. Little Blue River,  originating at 2,200 feet, has an average gradient of 5.3 feet per  mile, entering the Big Blue at 1,100 feet above mean sea level  (Nebraska State Planning Board, 1936:628, 637). The Little Blue is the  shallower stream, possibly because of the greater amount of sandy  glacial deposits in its watershed and the swift flow that may cause  lateral cutting, increased movement, and \"drifting\" of the sandy  bottom.    For approximately a 50-year period, stream-flow in the Big Blue River  at its point of entry into Kansas (Barnston, Nebraska) averaged 603  cubic feet per second, with maximum and minimum instantaneous flows of  57,700 c. f. s. and one c. f. s. The Little Blue River at Waterville,  Kansas, averaged a daily discharge of 601 c. f. s. (maximum 50,400,  minimum 28). Below the confluence of the Big Blue and Little Blue  rivers, at Randolph, Kansas, the average daily discharge was 1,690  c.f.s. (maximum 98,000, minimum 31) (Kansas Water Resources  Fact-finding and Research Committee, 1955:27).    The turbidity of the Big Blue River, as determined by use of a Jackson  turbidimeter, varied from 27 parts per million in winter (January 10,  1958) to as high as 14,000 p.p.m. (July 12, 1958). The Little Blue  River has similar turbidities, with high readings being frequent. In  the summer of 1957, pH ranged from 7.2 to 8.4 in the Big Blue River  Basin--values that correspond closely with those of Canfield and Wiebe  (1931:3) who made 25 determinations ranging from 7.3 to 8.3 in the  streams of the Nebraskan portion of this basin in July, 1930. Surface  temperatures at various stations varied from 38 deg. F. on January 10,  1958, to 90 deg. F. in backwater-areas on July 19, 1957. The average  surface temperature at mid-day in July and August, 1957, was  approximately 86.5 deg. F.    Chemical determinations were made on water-samples from my Station 4-S  on the Big Blue River, and Station 50-S on the Little Blue (Table 1).  These samples were taken from the surface in strong current.  Determinations were made by methods described in _Standard Methods for  the Examination of Water and Sewage_, 10th edition, 1955.

Many of the hills are virgin bluestem prairies  (_Andropogon_ spp.), but the floodplains are heavily cultivated.    MUD-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--Streams of this kind are present in the  watershed of the Black Vermillion River that enters Big Blue River  from the east. The area east of the Big Blue River and north of the  Black Vermillion River is till plains, where relief seldom exceeds 100  feet (Walters, 1954:12). Streams in this portion of the basin, and  streams entering the Little Blue River from the west (Mill Creek and  Horseshoe Creek systems), tend to have V-shaped channels, fewer  riffles than the Little Blue and Big Blue rivers and in the gravelly  streams (to be described later), and have bottoms of mud or clay, with  few rocks (Plate 12, Fig. 1). However, in the extreme headwaters of  most western tributaries of the Little Blue River (in Washington and  Republic counties) sandy bottoms predominate. The Black Vermillion  River flows on a broad floodplain and is a mud-bottomed, sluggish  stream, with an average gradient of approximately one foot per mile.  Fringe-forests of elm, cottonwood, sycamore, and willow persist along  most of these stream-courses.    Notwithstanding the mud bottoms, the water in this kind of stream in  the Big Blue Basin remains clearer than that of the Big Blue and  Little Blue rivers. Heavy algal blooms were noted in the Black  Vermillion River and Mill Creek, Washington County, in 1957 and 1958.  Temperatures at Stations 45-M and 46-M on Mill Creek, Washington  County, averaged 85.5 deg. F. on July 31, 1957. Chemical characteristics  of a water-sample from Station 35-M, Black Vermillion River, are in  Table 1.    GRAVEL-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--Most streams of this kind are tributary to  the Big Blue River; however, streams entering Black Vermillion River  from the south are also of this type (Plate 12, Fig. 2). The streams  are \"characteristically a series of large pools (to 100 feet in length  and more than two feet in depth) connected by short riffles and  smaller pools\" (Minckley and Cross, in press). The average gradients  are high: Carnahan Creek, 33 feet per mile; Mill Creek, Riley County,  21 feet; Clear Creek, 16 feet per mile. Stream-flow is usually less  than five cubic feet per second. In summer, these streams may become  intermittent, but springs and subsurface percolation maintain  pool-levels (Minckley and Cross, _loc. cit._).    The average temperatures of these small streams (79.5 deg. to 81.0 deg. F. in  July and August, 1957) were lower than temperatures in stream-types  previously described. Turbidities were usually less than 25 p.p.m. The  chemical properties of water-samples from two of these streams  (Stations 11-G and 18-G) are listed in Table 1.          PREVIOUS RECORDS OF FISHES      The earliest records of fishes from the Big Blue River Basin are those  of Cragin (1885) and Graham (1885) in independently published lists of  the fishes of Kansas. Meek (1895) recorded fishes collected in 1891  \"from both branches of the Blue River, a few miles west of Crete,  Nebraska.\" Evermann and Cox (1896) reported five collections from the  Nebraskan part of the basin. Their collections were made in October,  1892, and August, 1893, and the stations were: in 1892, Big Blue River  at Crete; in 1893, Big Blue River at Seward, Lincoln Creek at Seward  and York, and Beaver Creek at York.    Canfield and Wiebe (1931) obtained fish from 18 localities in Nebraska  in July, 1930; however, their major concern was determination of water  quality. Their stations were: Big Blue River at Stromsburg, Polk Co.;  Surprise and Ulysses, Butler Co.; Staplehurst, Seward, and Milford,  Seward Co.; Crete and Wilber, Saline Co.; Beatrice, Blue Springs, and  Barnston, Gage Co.; Little Blue River at Fairbury, Jefferson Co.;  Hebron, Thayer Co.; Sandy Creek at Alexandria, Thayer Co.; West Fork  of Big Blue River at Stockham, Hamilton Co.; McCool Junction, York  Co.; Beaver Crossing, Seward Co.; and Beaver Creek at York, York Co.    Breukelman (1940) and Jennings (1942) listed fishes from the  University of Kansas Museum of Natural History and the Kansas State  College Museum, respectively, including some specimens collected from  the Big Blue River System in Kansas. Because records in these two  papers pertain to collections that were widely spaced in the basin and  in time, the specific localities are not given herein. One of  Jennings' (_loc. cit.)_ records, _Scaphirhynchus platorynchus_  (Rafinesque), was cited by Bailey and Cross (1954:191). More recently,  Minckley and Cross (in press) recorded several localities, and cited  some papers mentioned above, in a publication dealing with _Notropis  topeka_ (Gilbert) in Kansas.    Information on the fishes of the Nebraskan portion of the Big Blue  River Basin was compiled, and additional localities were reported, in  a doctoral thesis by Dr. Raymond E. Johnson, entitled The Distribution  of Nebraska Fishes, 1942, at the University of Michigan.          METHODS AND MATERIALS      _Collection of Fishes_    The gear and"]]]
