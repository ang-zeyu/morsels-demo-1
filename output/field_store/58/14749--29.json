Some  believe hearing lies in the antennae.  Hicks has made an especial  study of a fluid filled cavity closed by a membrane that he thinks  he has demonstrated to be the seat of hearing.  Leydig, Gerstaecker,  and others believe this same organ to be olfactory.  Perhaps, after  all, there is room for only one more doctor of science who will  permanently settle this and a few other vexing questions for us.    But what of the millions of Nature Lovers, who each year snatch only  a brief time afield, for rest and recreation?  What of the masses  of men and women whose daily  application to the work of life makes  vacation study a burden, or whose business has so broken the habit  of study that concentration is distasteful if not impossible?  These people number in the ratio of a million to one Naturalist.  They would be delighted to learn the simplest name possible for  the creatures they or their friends find afield, and the markings,  habits, and characteristics by which they can be identified.  They do not care in the least for species and minute detail  concerning anatomy, couched in resounding Latin and Greek terms  they cannot possibly remember.    I never have seen or heard of any person who on being shown any  one of ten of our most beautiful moths, did not consider and  promptly pronounce it the most exquisite creation he ever had seen,  and evince a lively interest in its history.  But when he found it  necessary to purchase a text-book, devoid of all human interest  or literary possibility, and wade through pages of scientific  dissertation, all the time having the feeling that perhaps through  his lack of experience his identification was not aright, he usually  preferred to remain in ignorance.  It is in the belief that all  Nature Lovers, afield for entertainment or instruction, will be  thankful for a simplification of any method now existing for  becoming acquainted with moths, that this book is written  and illustrated.    In gathering the material used I think it is quite true that I have  lost as many good subjects as I have secured, in my efforts to  follow the teachings of scientific writers.  My complaint against  them is that they neglect essential detail and are not always  rightly informed.  They confuse one with a flood of scientific  terms describing minute anatomical parts and fail to explain the  simple yet absolutely essential points over which an amateur has  trouble, wheat often only a few words would suffice.    For example, any one of half a dozen writers tells us that when  a caterpillar finishes eating and is ready to go into winter  quarters it crawls rapidly around for a time, empties the  intestines, and transformation takes place.  Why do not some  of them explain further that a caterpillar of, say, six inches in  length will shrink to THREE, its skin become loosened, the horns  drop limp, and the creature appear dead and disintegrating?  Because no one mentioned these things, I concluded that the first  caterpillar I found in this state was lost to me and threw it away.  A few words would have saved the complete history of a beautiful  moth, to secure which no second opportunity was presented for five  years.    Several works I consulted united in the simple statement that  certain caterpillars pupate in the ground.    In Packard's \"Guide\", you will find this--\"Lepidopterous pupae should  be...kept moist in mould until the image appears.\"  I followed this  direction, even taking the precaution to bake the earth used,  because I was very anxious about some rare moths.  When they failed to emerge in season I dug them out, only to find  that those not moulded had been held fast by  the damp, packed  earth, and all were ruined.  I learned by investigation that  pupation takes place in a hole worked out by the caterpillar, so  earth must touch these cases only as they lie upon it.  The one  word 'hole' would have saved all those moths for me.    One writer stated that the tongue cases of some pupae turn over  and fasten on the back between the wing shields, and others were  strangely silent on the subject.  So for ten months I kept some  cases lying on their backs with the feet up and photographed  them in that position.  I had to discover for myself that  caterpillars that pupate in the ground change to the moth form with  the feet and legs folded around the under side of the thorax, the  wings wrap over them, and the tongue case bends UNDER and is  fastened between the wings.    For years I could find nothing on the subject of how a moth from a  burrowing caterpillar made its appearance.  In two recent works I  find the statement that the pupa cases come to the surface before  the moths leave them, but how the operation is performed is not  described or explained.  Pupa cases from earth consist of two  principal parts: the blunt head and thorax covering, and the  ringed abdominal sections.  With many feeders there is a long,  fragile tongue shield.  The head is rounded and immovable of its  own volition.  The abdominal part is in rings that can be turned  and twisted; on the tip are two tiny, needlesharp points, and on  each of three rings of the abdominal shield there are in many  cases a pair of tiny hooks, very slight projections, yet enough  to be of use.  Some lepidopterists think the pupa works head first  to the surface, pushing with the abdomen.  To me this seems impossible.  The more one forced the blunt head against the earth the closer  it would pack, and the delicate tongue shield surely would break.  There is no projection on the head that would loosen or lift  the earth.    One prominent lepidopterist I know, believes the moth emerges  underground, and works its way to the surface as it fights to  escape a cocoon.  I consider this an utter impossibility.  Remember the earth-encrusted cicada cases you have seen clinging  to the trunks of trees, after the insect has reached the surface  and abandoned them.  Think what would happen to the delicate moth  head, wings, and downy covering!  I am willing to wager all I  possess, that no lepidopterist, or any amateur, ever found a  freshly emerged moth from an underground case with the faintest  trace of soil on its head or feet, or a particle of down missing;  as there unquestionably must be, if it forced its way to freedom  through the damp spring earth with its mouth and feet.    The point was settled for me when, while working in my garden,  one came through the surface within a few inches of my fingers,  working with the tip of the abdomen.  It turned, twisted, dug  away the dirt, fastened the abdominal tip, pulled up the head,  and then bored with the tip again.  Later I saw several others  emerge in the same way, and then made some experiments that  forever convinced me that this is the only manner in which ground  pupae possibly  could emerge.    One writer I had reason to suppose standard authority stated that  caterpillars from Citheronia Regalis eggs emerged in sixteen days.  So I boxed some eggs deposited on the eleventh, labelled them due  to produce caterpillars on the twenty-seventh and put away the box  to be attended on that date.  Having occasion to move it on the  twentyfourth, I peeped in and found half my caterpillars out and  starved, proving that they had been hatched at least thirty-six  hours or longer; half the others so feeble they soon became  inactive, and the remainder survived and pupated.  But if the time  specified had been allowed to elapse, every  caterpillar would  have starved.    One of the books I read preparatory to doing this work asserts  concerning spinners: \"Most caterpillars make some sort of cocoon  or shelter, which may be of pure silk neatly wound, or of silk  mixed with hair and all manner of external things--such as pieces  of leaf, bark, moss, and lichen, and even grains of earth.\"    I have had caterpillars spin by the hundred, in boxes containing  most of these things, have gathered outdoor cocoons by the peck,  and microscopically examined dozens of them, and with the  exception of leaf, twig, bark, or some other foundation against  which it was spun, I never have seen a cocoon with shred, filament,  or particle of anything used in its composition that was not drawn  from the spinning tube or internal organism of the caterpillar,  with the possible exception of a few hairs from the tubercles.  I  have been told by other workers that they have had captive caterpillars  use earth and excrement in their cocoons.    This same work, in an article on protective colouration, lays  emphasis on the statement that among pupa cases artificially  fastened to different objects out of doors, \"the elimination was  ninety-two per cent on fences where pupae were conspicuous, as  against fifty-two per cent among nettles, where they were inconspicuous.\"  This statement is elaborated and commented upon as making a strong  point for colourative protection through inconspicuousness.    Personally, I think the nettles did the work, regardless of colour.  I have learned to much experience afield that a patch of nettles or  thistles afford splendid protection to any form of life that can  survive them.  I have seen insects and nesting birds find a safety  in their shelter, unknown to their kind that home elsewhere.  The  test is not fair enough to be worth consideration.  If these same  pupae had been as conspicuously  placed as on the fence, on any  EDIBLE GROWTH, in the same location as the fence, and then left to  the mercy of playing children, grazing stock, field mice, snakes,  bats, birds, insects and parasites, the story of what happened to  them would have been different.  I doubt very seriously if it  would have proved the point those lepidopterists started out to  make in these conditions, which are the only fair"]]]
