With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus  going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied  up in a cotton handkerchief.    That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic  patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous  burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of  rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers  occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make  hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from  pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the  dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little  empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating.  He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children,  particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so  magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee,  and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.    In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the  neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the  young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on  Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band  of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away  the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above  all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still  to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off,  quite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning,  which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod  Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is  commonly denominated \"by hook and by crook,\" the worthy pedagogue got on  tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the  labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.    The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female  circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle,  gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to  the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the  parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir  at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary  dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver  teapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the  smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the  churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from  the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their  amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a  whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the  more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior  elegance and address.    From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette,  carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that  his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover,  esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read  several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's  \"History of New England Witchcraft,\" in which, by the way, he most  firmly and potently believed.    He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple  credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting  it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his  residence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous  for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school  was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of  clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and  there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of  evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he  wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse  where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that  witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of the  whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that  harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the  sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The  fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now  and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across  his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging  his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up  the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His  only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away  evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy  Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with  awe at hearing his nasal melody, \"in linked sweetness long drawn out,\"  floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.    Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter  evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire,  with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and  listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted  fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses,  and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the  Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by  his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous  sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of  Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon  comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did  absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!    But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in  the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the  crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show  its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk  homewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the  dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he  eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from  some distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered  with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often  did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the  frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest  he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And how  often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling  among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of  his nightly scourings!    All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind  that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time,  and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely  perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would  have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his  works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more  perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of  witches put together, and that was--a woman.    Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week,  to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel,  the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a  blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting  and rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches, and universally famed,  not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a  little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was  a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off  her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her  great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting  stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat,  to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.    Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is  not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his  eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion.  Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented,  liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or  his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those  everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with  his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty  abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was  situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered,  fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A  great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which  bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well  formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to  a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows.  Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a  church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the  treasures of the farm; the flail was busily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41017"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 5 (of 8) (#2)"],[1,"ned.    =24.=--British Army entered the Transvaal, crossing the Vaal near      Parys, unopposed.    =27.=--The passage of the Vaal was completed by the British Army.    =28.=--Orange Free State formally annexed under the title of Orange      River Colony.

DISASTER AT KOORN SPRUIT    The last volume closed with an account of Colonel Plumer's desperate  effort to relieve Mafeking on the 31st of March. On that unlucky day  events of a tragic, if heroical, nature were taking place elsewhere.  These have now to be chronicled. On the 18th of March a force was moved  out under the command of Colonel Broadwood to the east of Bloemfontein.  The troops were sent to garrison Thabanchu, to issue proclamations, and  to contribute to the pacification of the outlying districts. They were  also to secure a valuable consignment of flour from the Leeuw Mills. The  enemy was prowling about, and two commandos hovered north of the small  detached post at the mills. Reinforcements were prayed for, and a strong  patrol was sent off for the protection of the post, or to cover its  withdrawal in the event of attack. Meanwhile the enemy was \"lying low,\"  as the phrase is. Whereupon Colonel Pilcher pushed on to Ladybrand, made  a prisoner of the Landdrost, but, hearing of the advance of an  overwhelming number of the foe, retired with all promptness to  Thabanchu. The Boers, with the mobility characteristic of them, were  gathering together their numbers, determining if possible to prevent any  onward move of the forces, and bent at all costs on securing for their  own comfort and convenience the southern corner of the Free State,  whence the provender and forage of the future might be expected to come.  Without this portion of the grain country to fall back on, they knew  their activities would be crippled indeed.    In consequence, therefore, of the close proximity of these Federal  hordes, Colonel Broadwood made an application to head-quarters for  reinforcements, and decided to remove from Thabanchu. On Friday the 30th  he marched to Bloemfontein Waterworks, south of the Modder. His force  consisted of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade (10th Hussars and the composite  regiment of Household Cavalry), \"Q,\" \"T,\" and \"U\" Batteries R.H.A.  (formed into two six-gun batteries, \"Q\" and \"U\"), Rimington's Scouts,  Roberts's Horse, Queensland and Burma Mounted Infantry. The baggage  crossed the river, and outspanned the same evening. On the following  morning at 2 A.M. the force, having fought a rearguard action throughout  the night, arrived in safety at Sanna's Post. Here for a short time they  bivouacked, and here for a moment let us leave them.    At this time a mounted infantry patrol was scouring the country. They  were seen by some Boers who were scuttling across country from the  Ladybrand region, and these promptly hid in a convenient spruit, whence,  in the time that remained to them, they planned the ambush that was so  disastrous to our forces and so exhilarating to themselves. There are  differences of opinion regarding this story. Some believe that the  ambush was planned earlier by a skilful arrangement in concert with the  Boer hordes--the hornets of Ladybrand, whose nest had been disturbed by  the invasion of Colonel Pilcher--who owed Colonel Broadwood a debt. They  declare that the hiding-place was carefully sought out, so that those  sheltered therein should, on a given signal from De Wet, act in accord  with others of their tribe, and blockade the passage of the British, who  were known--everything was known--to be returning to Bloemfontein.    According to Boer reports, the plans for the cutting off and surrounding  of Colonel Broadwood were carefully made out, but only at the last  moment, and if, for once, Boer reports can be believed, the successful  scheme may be looked upon as one of the finest pieces of strategy with  which De Wet may be accredited. The Boer tale runs thus: The Dutchman on  the 28th, with a commando of 1400 and four guns and a Maxim-Nordenfeldt,  was moving towards Thabanchu for the purpose of attacking Sanna's Post,  where he believed a force of 200 of the British to be. He did all his  travelling by night, and found himself on the evening of the 30th at Jan  Staal's farm, on the Modder River, to the north of Sanna's Post. Then,  in the very nick of time, he was informed by a Boer runner that Colonel  Broadwood's convoy was moving from Thabanchu. Quickly a council of war  was gathered together. It was a matter of life or death. De Wet, with  Piet de Wet, Piet Cronje, Wessel, Nell, and Fourie, put their heads  together and schemed. They were doubtless assisted by the foreign  attaches who were present. The result of the hurried meeting was the  division of the Boer force into three commandos. The General himself,  with 400 men, decided to strain every nerve to reach Koorn Spruit and  ensconce himself before the arrival of the convoy. Being well acquainted  with the topography of the country, the race was possible--400 picked  horsemen against slow-moving, drowsy cattle! The thing was inviting.  Success rides but on the wings of opportunity, and De Wet saw the  opportunity and grabbed it! The rest of the Boers were to dispose  themselves in two batches--500 of them, with the artillery, to plant  themselves N.N.E. of Sanna's Post, while the remainder took up a  position on the left of their comrades, and extended in the direction of  the Thabanchu road.    It was wisely argued that Broadwood's transport must cross Koorn Spruit,  and that if the Boers were posted so as to shell the British camp at  daybreak, the convoy would be hurried on, while the bulk of the force  remained to guard the rear.    Accordingly, the conspirators, with amazing promptitude, got under way,  the four guns with the commando being double-horsed and despatched to  the point arranged on the N.N.E. of Sanna's Post, while the other  galloped as designed. Fortune favoured them, for they reached their  destinations undiscovered; and the scheme, admirable in conception, was  executed with signal success.    Day had scarcely dawned before the Boers near the region of the  waterworks apprised the convoy of their existence. The British kettles  were boiling, preparations for breakfast were briskly going forward,  when, plump!--a shell dropped in their midst. Consternation prevailed.  Something must be done. The artillery? No; the British guns were useless  at so long a range. As well have directed a penny squirt at a garden  hose! All that was to be thought of was removal--and that with all  possible despatch. Scurry and turmoil followed. Mules fought and  squealed and kicked, horses careered and plunged, but at last the convoy  and two horse batteries were got under way, while the mounted infantry  sprayed out to screen the retreat. All this time shells continued to  burst and bang with alarming persistency. They came from across the  river, and consequently it was imagined that every mile gained brought  the convoy nearer to Bloemfontein and farther from the enemy. They had  some twenty miles to go. Still, the officers who had charge of the party  believed the coast to be clear. After moving on about a mile they  approached a deep spruit--a branch of the Modder, more morass than  stream. It was there that De Wet and his smart 400 had artfully  concealed themselves.    The spruit offered every facility for the formation of an ingenious  trap. The ground rose on one side toward a grassy knoll, on the slopes  of which was a stony cave from which a hidden foe could command the  drifts. So admirably concealed was this enclosure and all that it  enclosed, that the leading scouts passed over the drift without  suspecting the presence of the enemy. These latter, true to their talent  of slimness, made no sign till waggons and guns had safely entered the  drift, and were, so to speak, inextricably in their clutches.    Their manoeuvre was entirely successful. Some one said the waggons  were driven into the drift exactly as partridges are driven to the gun.  Another gave a version of very much"]]]
