He was presented to the King, went to all the balls and  operas, rode, gamed, made one of the fastest set, and yet in the midst  of it all was discontented. He wanted to be alone, and finally applied  to the King of Piedmont through his minister at Naples for permission  to travel by himself. His request was granted, and at nineteen he set  out to make what was then the fashionable grand tour. He traveled in  state, with plenty of money, and a body servant, and with letters of  introduction to the various courts.    It so happened that Alfieri had met certain French actors during a  summer holiday, and from talking with them he felt a desire to see  something of the French stage. He had no wish to try his own skill  at dramatic compositions--indeed his only thought of an occupation  at this time was that he should some day enter the diplomatic  service--but he was anxious to see something different from the  absurdly conventional Italian plays produced by the school which took  its name from Metastasio. He went first to Marseilles, where he spent  his time between the theater and solitary musing on the seashore.  Thence, after a short stay, he journeyed to Paris, full of the keenest  anticipations of finding pleasure in that famous city. His memoirs tell  us his feelings there. He writes: \"The mean and wretched buildings, the  contemptible ostentation displayed in a few houses dignified with the  pompous appellation of hotels and palaces, the filthiness of the Gothic  churches, the truly vandal-like construction of the public theaters at  that time, besides innumerable other disagreeable objects, of which not  the least disgusting to me was the painted countenances of many very  ugly women, far outweighed in my mind the beauty and elegance of the  public walks and gardens, the infinite variety of the carriages, the  lofty facade of the Louvre, as well as the number of spectacles and  entertainments of every kind.\" Verily the young Alfieri was either the  hardest of all travelers to suit, or the older man, looking back, wished  to emphasize the perverseness of his youth.    The Piedmontese Minister presented the young traveler to Louis XV.,  concerning whom Alfieri wrote, \"He received with a cold and supercilious  air those who were presented to him, surveying them from head to foot.  It seemed as if on presenting a dwarf to a giant he should view him  smiling, or perhaps say, 'Ah! the little animal!' or if he remained  silent his air and manner would express the same derision.\" He was  not at all attracted by the French court, which he considered very  pompous, and was anxious to be out on the highroads again, driving his  post-horses. In January, 1768, he crossed the channel and landed at  Dover.    England delighted him, he found London far more to his taste than Paris,  he was charmed with the country, the large estates, the inns, the roads,  the horses, the people, all pleased him. He was particularly struck  with the absence of poverty. For a time he even thought of settling  there permanently, and years afterwards when he had seen much of all  the European countries he said that Italy and England were the two he  infinitely preferred as residences.    But of the pleasures of London's fashionable life the young wanderer  soon tired, and for variety turned coachman, and drove a friend with  whom he was staying through all the city streets, leaving him wherever  he wished, and waiting patiently on the box for his return. \"My  amusements through the course of the winter,\" he wrote, \"consisted in  being on horseback during five or six hours every morning, and in being  seated on the coach-box for two or three hours every evening, whatever  might be the state of the weather.\" His tastes at this time were  closely akin to those of many of his English friends.    Finally he left London and went to Holland. There he met Don Joseph  d'Acunha, the Portuguese Ambassador, a man of considerable literary  taste, who induced him to read Machiavelli, and first led him to think  of trying his literary skill. At The Hague he also fell deeply in love,  and, quite according to the fashionable custom of the time, with a young  married woman. For the moment his fits of morbidness and continual  unrest left him, he contrived constantly to be with the woman he loved,  and even followed her and her husband to Spa. A short time afterwards  the husband started for Switzerland, and the young wife returned to The  Hague. For ten days Alfieri was constantly in her society, then came  a message from her husband bidding her follow him. She wrote Alfieri  a note saying farewell and sent it to him through D'Acunha after she  had left the city. The youth was prostrated and with the violence of  his nature planned to kill himself. He complained of illness and had  himself bled. When he was alone he tore off the bandages with the idea  of bleeding to death. His faithful valet, however, knew the peculiar  nature of his master, and entered Alfieri's room. The bandages were  replaced, and the incident ended, although it was long before the young  man could recover from the parting with his fair lady. He passed through  Belgium to Switzerland, and so on back to Piedmont, still wrapped in  recollections, and unable to awaken any lasting interest.    Living with his sister, first in the country, and later in Turin, a  short term of peace succeeded in Alfieri's life. He set himself to  reading, and studied with considerable care the popular French authors,  Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire. Plutarch, however, became his chief  companion. In one of the most characteristic pages of his memoirs we  find him writing, \"The book of all others which gave me most delight and  beguiled many of the tedious hours of winter, was Plutarch. I perused  five or six times the lives of Timoleon, Caesar, Brutus, Pelopidas, and  some others. I wept, raved, and fell into such a transport of fury, that  if any one had been in the adjoining chamber they must have pronounced  me out of my senses. Every time I came to any of the great actions of  those celebrated individuals, my agitation was so extreme that I could  not remain seated. I was like one beside himself, and shed tears of  mingled grief and rage at having been born in Piedmont and at a period  and under a government where it was impossible to conceive or execute  any great design.\" Plutarch first set before him vividly the contrast  between the Italy of the past and of his own day. As a result he became  dissatisfied with his own inability to win any high distinction.    The winter of his twentieth year found Alfieri still without any  definite plans, now studying astronomy, now considering a diplomatic  career. With spring he determined again to travel, and in May set  off for Vienna. The spirit of unrest had given place to a brooding  melancholy. In this sense of the times being out of joint and himself  without work to do was born the gradual desire to write something  different from and in a more heroic strain than the rigorously  conservative dramas of the day. He traveled with Montaigne's Essays in  his pockets, and Montaigne, he says, first taught him to think. He still  found difficulty in reading Italian and much preferred foreign authors  to those of his own land.    In Vienna Alfieri had a chance to meet the most eminent of then living  Italian authors, a man much admired in his generation. The opportunity  he declined. \"I had seen Metastasio,\" he says, \"in the gardens of  Schoenbrunn, perform the customary genuflection to Maria Theresa in such  a servile and adulatory manner, that I, who had my head stuffed with  Plutarch, and who embellished every theory, could not think of binding  myself, either by the ties of familiarity or friendship, with a poet  who had sold himself to a despotism which I so cordially detested.\"  In Berlin he was presented to Frederick the Great, and as he writes  \"mentally thanked Heaven I was not born his slave. Towards the middle of  November I departed from this Prussian encampment, which I regarded with  detestation and horror.\"    From Berlin the young man went to Denmark, thence to Sweden, thence to  Russia. He says, \"I approached Petersburg with a mind wound up to an  extraordinary pitch of anxiety and expectation. But alas! no sooner had  I reached this Asiatic assemblage of wooden huts, than Rome, Genoa,  Venice, and Florence rose to my recollections, and I could not refrain  from laughing. What I afterwards saw of this country tended still more  strongly to confirm my first impression that it merited not to be seen.  Everything but their beards and their horses disgusted me so much, that  during the six weeks I remained among these savages I wished not to  become acquainted with any one, nor even to see the two or three youths  with whom I had associated at Turin, and who were descended from the  first families of the country. I took no measure to be presented to  the celebrated Autocratrix Catherine II., nor did I even behold the  countenance of a sovereign who in our days has out-stripped fame.\"    A little later he was back in England, and now again he fell in  love, this time also with a married woman of rank. With a truly  Byronic audacity he defied all the conventions, accompanied the woman  everywhere, and became a subject of town scandal. Finally confronted by  the husband, he fought a duel with swords in a field near St. James's  Park, his left arm being in a sling at the time as the result of a  bit of too daring horsemanship. Alfieri was slightly wounded, and the  husband declared himself satisfied. Shortly after the latter sued for  divorce, bringing the Italian's name into the case. The newspapers took  up the scandal, and the matter became a cause celebre. Alfieri was on  the point of proposing marriage, when the woman, by her own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#2)"],[1,"; while the Indians still occupied the greater part of the  State.  Nearly every man had to be somewhat of a soldier, but I  think my father was only a commissary; still, he seems to have  caught a fancy for the great chief of the Shawnees, \"Tecumseh.\"    Perry's victory on Lake Erie was the turning-point of the Western  campaign, and General Harrison's victory over the British and  Indians at the river Thames in Canada ended the war in the West,  and restored peace and tranquillity to the exposed settlers of  Ohio.  My father at once resumed his practice at the bar, and was  soon recognized as an able and successful lawyer.  When, in 1816,  my brother James was born, he insisted on engrafting the Indian  name \"Tecumseh\" on the usual family list.  My mother had already  named her first son after her own brother Charles; and insisted on  the second son taking the name of her other brother James, and when  I came along, on the 8th of February, 1820, mother having no more  brothers, my father succeeded in his original purpose, and named me  William Tecumseh.    The family rapidly increased till it embraced six boys and five  girls, all of whom attained maturity and married; of these six are  still living.    In the year 1821 a vacancy occurred in the Supreme Court of Ohio,  and I find this petition:      Somerset, Ohio, July 6, 1821.    May it please your Excellency:    We ask leave to recommend to your Excellency's favorable notice  Charles R. Sherman, Esq., of Lancaster, as a man possessing in an  eminent degree those qualifications so much to be desired in a  Judge of the Supreme Court.    From a long acquaintance with Mr. Sherman, we are happy to be able  to state to your Excellency that our minds are led to the  conclusion that that gentleman possesses a disposition noble and  generous, a mind discriminating, comprehensive, and combining a  heart pure, benevolent and humane.  Manners dignified, mild, and  complaisant, and a firmness not to be shaken and of unquestioned  integrity.    But Mr. Sherman's character cannot be unknown to your Excellency,  and on that acquaintance without further comment we might safely  rest his pretensions.    We think we hazard little in assuring your Excellency that his  appointment would give almost universal satisfaction to the  citizens of Perry County.    With great consideration, we have the honor to be    Your Excellency's most obedient humble servants,  CHARLES A. HOOD,  GEORGE TREAT,  PETER DITTOR,  P. ODLIN,  J. B. ORTEN,  T. BECKWITH,  WILLIAM P. DORST,  JOHN MURRAY,  JACOB MOINS,  B. EATON,  DANIEL GRIGGS,  HENRY DITTOE,  NICHOLAS McCARTY.        His Excellency ETHAN A. BROWN,  Governor of Ohio, Columbus.      He was soon after appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court, and  served in that capacity to the day of his death.    My memory extends back to about 1827, and I recall him, returning  home on horseback, when all the boys used to run and contend for  the privilege of riding his horse from the front door back to the  stable.  On one occasion, I was the first, and being mounted rode  to the stable; but \"Old Dick\" was impatient because the stable-door  was not opened promptly, so he started for the barn of our neighbor  Mr. King; there, also, no one was in waiting to open the gate, and,  after a reasonable time, \"Dick\" started back for home somewhat in a  hurry, and threw me among a pile of stones, in front of preacher  Wright's house, where I was picked up apparently a dead boy; but my  time was not yet, and I recovered, though the scars remain to this  day.    The year 1829 was a sad one to our family.  We were then ten  children, my eldest brother Charles absent at the State University,  Athens, Ohio; my next brother, James, in a store at Cincinnati; and  the rest were at home, at school.  Father was away on the circuit.  One day Jane Sturgeon came to the school, called us out, and when  we reached home all was lamentation: news had come that father was  ill unto death, at Lebanon, a hundred miles away.  Mother started  at once, by coach, but met the news of his death about Washington,  and returned home.  He had ridden on horseback from Cincinnati to  Lebanon to hold court, during a hot day in June.  On the next day  he took his seat on the bench, opened court in the forenoon, but in  the afternoon, after recess, was seized with a severe chill and had  to adjourn the court.  The best medical aid was called in, and for  three days with apparent success, but the fever then assumed a more  dangerous type, and he gradually yielded to it, dying on the sixth  day, viz., June 24, 1829.    My brother James had been summoned from Cincinnati, and was present  at his bedside, as was also Henry Stoddard, Esq., of Dayton, Ohio,  our cousin.  Mr. Stoddard once told me that the cause of my  father's death was cholera; but at that time, 1829, there was no  Asiatic cholera in the United States, and the family, attributed  his death to exposure to the hot sun of June, and a consequent  fever, \"typhoid.\"    From the resolutions of the bench, bar, and public generally, now  in my possession, his death was universally deplored; more  especially by his neighbors in Lancaster, and by the Society of  Freemasons, of which he was the High-Priest of Arch Chapter No. 11.      His death left the family very poor, but friends rose up with  proffers of generous care and assistance; for all the neighbors  knew that mother could not maintain so large a family without help.  My eldest brother, Charles, had nearly completed his education at  the university at Athens, and concluded to go to his uncle, Judge  Parker, at Mansfield, Ohio, to study law.  My eldest sister,  Elizabeth, soon after married William J. Reese, Esq.; James was  already in a store at Cincinnati; and, with the exception of the  three youngest children, the rest of us were scattered.  I fell to  the charge of the Hon. Thomas Ewing, who took me to his family, and  ever after treated me as his own son.    I continued at the Academy in Lancaster, which was the best in the  place; indeed, as good a school as any in Ohio.  We studied all the  common branches of knowledge, including Latin, Greek, and French.  At first the school was kept by Mr. Parsons; he was succeeded by  Mr. Brown, and he by two brothers, Samuel and Mark How.  These were  all excellent teachers, and we made good progress, first at the old  academy and afterward at a new school-house, built by Samuel How,  in the orchard of Hugh Boyle, Esq.    Time passed with us as with boys generally.  Mr. Ewing was in the  United States Senate, and I was notified to prepare for West Point,  of which institution we had little knowledge, except that it was  very strict, and that the army was its natural consequence.  In  1834 I was large for my age, and the construction of canals was the  rage in Ohio.  A canal was projected to connect with the great Ohio  Canal at Carroll (eight miles above Lancaster), down the valley of  the Hock Hocking to Athens (forty-four miles), and thence to the  Ohio River by slack water.    Preacher Carpenter, of Lancaster, was appointed to make the  preliminary surveys, and selected the necessary working party out  of the boys of the town.  From our school were chosen ____Wilson,  Emanuel Geisy, William King, and myself.  Geisy and I were the  rod-men.  We worked during that fall and next spring, marking two  experimental lines, and for our work we each received a silver  half-dollar for each day's actual work, the first money any of us  had ever earned.    In June, 1835, one of our school-fellows, William Irvin, was  appointed a cadet to West Point, and, as it required sixteen years  of age for admission, I had to wait another year.  During the  autumn of 1835 and spring of 1836 I devoted myself chiefly to  mathematics and French, which were known to be the chief requisites  for admission to West Point.    Some time in the spring of 1836 I received through Mr. Ewing, then  at Washington, from the Secretary of War, Mr. Poinsett, the letter  of appointment as a cadet, with a list of the articles of clothing  necessary to be taken along, all of which were liberally provided  by Mrs. Ewing; and with orders to report to Mr. Ewing, at  Washington, by a certain date, I left Lancaster about the 20th of  May in the stage-coach for Zanesville.  There we transferred to the  coaches of the Great National Road, the highway of travel from the  West to the East.  The stages generally travelled in gangs of from  one to six coaches, each drawn by four good horses, carrying nine  passengers inside and three or four outside.    In about three days, travelling day and night, we reached  Frederick, Maryland.  There we were told that we could take  rail-cars to Baltimore, and thence to Washington; but there was  also a two-horse hack ready to start for Washington direct.  Not  having full faith in the novel and dangerous railroad, I stuck to  the coach, and in the night reached Gadsby's Hotel in Washington  City.    The next morning I hunted up Mr. Ewing, and found him boarding with  a mess of Senators at Mrs. Hill's, corner of Third and C Streets,  and transferred my trunk to the same place.  I spent a week in  Washington, and think I saw more of the place in that time than I  ever have since in the many years of residence there.  General  Jackson was President, and was at the zenith of his fame.  I recall  looking at him a full hour, one morning, through the wood railing  on Pennsylvania Avenue, as he paced up and down the gravel walk on  the north front of the White House.  He wore a cap and an overcoat  so full that his form seemed smaller than I had expected.  I also  recall the appearance of Postmaster-General Amos Kendall, of  Vice-President Van Buren, Messrs. Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Cass,  Silas Wright, etc.    In due time I took my departure for West Point with Cadets Belt and  Bronaugh.  These were appointed cadets as from Ohio, although  neither had ever seen"]]]
