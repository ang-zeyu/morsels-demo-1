So that many a poor fellow in a single wild carouse in Quebec, or more  frequently in some river town, would fling into the hands of sharks  and harlots and tavern-keepers, with whom the bosses were sometimes in  league, the earnings of his long winter's work, and would wake to find  himself sick and penniless, far from home and broken in spirit.    Of all the shanty-men of the Ottawa the men of Glengarry, and of  Glengarry men Macdonald's gang were easily first, and of the gang Donald  Bhain Macdonald, or Macdonald More, or the Big Macdonald, for he was  variously known, was not only the \"boss\" but best and chief. There was  none like him. A giant in size and strength, a prince of broad-axe men,  at home in the woods, sure-footed and daring on the water, free with  his wages, and always ready to drink with friend or fight with foe, the  whole river admired, feared, or hated him, while his own men followed  him into the woods, on to a jam, or into a fight with equal joyousness  and devotion. Fighting was like wine to him, when the fight was worth  while, and he went into the fights his admirers were always arranging  for him with the easiest good humor and with a smile on his face. But  Macdonald Bhain's carousing, fighting days came to an abrupt stop about  three years before the opening of this tale, for on one of his summer  visits to his home, \"The word of the Lord in the mouth of his servant  Alexander Murray,\" as he was wont to say, \"found him and he was a new  man.\" He went into his new life with the same whole-souled joyousness as  had marked the old, and he announced that with the shanty and the river  he was \"done for ever more.\" But after the summer's work was done, and  the logging over, and when the snap of the first frost nipped the leaves  from the trees, Macdonald became restless. He took down his broad-axe  and spent hours polishing it and bringing it to an edge, then he put it  in its wooden sheath and laid it away. But the fever was upon him, ten  thousand voices from the forest were shouting for him. He went away  troubled to his minister. In an hour he came back with the old good  humor in his face, took down the broad-axe again, and retouched it,  lovingly, humming the while the old river song of the Glengarry men--           Ho ro mo nighean, etc.      He was going back to the bush and to the biggest fight of his life. No  wonder he was glad. Then his good little wife began to get ready his  long, heavy stockings, his thick mits, his homespun smock, and other  gear, for she knew well that soon she would be alone for another  winter. Before long the word went round that Macdonald Bhain was for the  shanties again, and his men came to him for their orders.    But it was not to the old life that Macdonald was going, and he gravely  told those that came to him that he would take no man who could not  handle his axe and hand-spike, and who could not behave himself.  \"Behaving himself\" meant taking no more whiskey than a man could carry,  and refusing all invitations to fight unless \"necessity was laid upon  him.\" The only man to object was his own brother, Macdonald Dubh, whose  temper was swift to blaze, and with whom the blow was quicker than the  word. But after the second year of the new order even Black Hugh fell  into line. Macdonald soon became famous on the Ottawa. He picked only  the best men, he fed them well, paid them the highest wages, and cared  for their comfort, but held them in strictest discipline. They would  drink but kept sober, they would spend money but knew how much was  coming to them. They feared no men even of \"twice their own heavy and  big,\" but would never fight except under necessity. Contracts began to  come their way. They made money, and what was better, they brought it  home. The best men sought to join them, but by rival gangs and by men  rejected from their ranks they were hated with deepest heart hatred. But  the men from Glengarry knew no fear and sought no favor. They asked only  a good belt of pine and an open river. As a rule they got both, and it  was peculiarly maddening to Black Hugh to find two or three miles of  solid logs between his timber and the open water of the Nation. Black  Hugh had a temper fierce and quick, and when in full flame he was a man  to avoid, for from neither man nor devil would he turn. The only man  who could hold him was his brother Macdonald Bhain, for strong man as  he was, Black Hugh knew well that his brother could with a single swift  grip bring him to his knees.    It was unfortunate that the command of the party this day should have  been Macdonald Dubh's. Unfortunate, too, that it was Dan Murphy and his  men that happened to be blocking the river mouth. For the Glengarry men,  who handled only square timber, despised the Murphy gang as sawlog-men;  \"log-rollers\" or \"mushrats\" they called them, and hated them as Irish  \"Papishes\" and French \"Crapeaux,\" while between Dan Murphy and Macdonald  Dubh there was an ancient personal grudge, and to-day Murphy thought he  had found his time. There were only six of the enemy, he had ten times  the number with him, many of them eager to pay off old scores; and  besides there was Louis LeNoir as the \"Boss Bully\" of the river. The  Frenchman was not only a powerful man, active with hands and feet, but  he was an adept in all kinds of fighting tricks. Since coming to the  Ottawa he had heard of the big Macdonald, and he sought to meet him. But  Macdonald avoided him once and again till LeNoir, having never known  any one avoiding a fight for any reason other than fear, proclaimed  Macdonald a coward, and himself \"de boss on de reever.\" Now there was  a chance of meeting his rival and of forcing a fight, for the Glengarry  camp could not be far away where the big Macdonald himself would be.  So Dan Murphy, backed up with numbers, and the boss bully LeNoir,  determined that for these Macdonald men the day of settlement had  come. But they were dangerous men, and it would be well to take all  precautions, and hence his friendly invitation to the tavern for drinks.    Macdonald Dubh, scorning to show hesitation, though he suspected  treachery, strode after Murphy to the tavern door and through the crowd  of shanty-men filling the room. They were as ferocious looking a lot  of men as could well be got together, even in that country and in those  days--shaggy of hair and beard, dressed out in red and blue and green  jerseys, with knitted sashes about their waists, and red and blue and  green tuques on their heads. Drunken rows were their delight, and fights  so fierce that many a man came out battered and bruised to death or to  life-long decrepitude. They were sitting on the benches that ran round  the room, or lounging against the bar singing, talking, blaspheming. At  the sight of Macdonald Dubh and his men there fell a dead silence, and  then growls of recognition, but Murphy was not yet ready, and roaring  out \"Dh-r-r-i-n-k-s,\" he seized a couple of his men leaning against the  bar, and hurling them to right and left, cried, \"Ma-a-ke room for yer  betthers, be the powers! Sthand up, bhoys, and fill yirsilves!\"    Black Hugh and his men lined up gravely to the bar and were straightway  surrounded by the crowd yelling hideously. But if Murphy and his gang  thought to intimidate those grave Highlanders with noise, they were  greatly mistaken, for they stood quietly waiting for their glasses to  be filled, alert, but with an air of perfect indifference. Some eight or  ten glasses were set down and filled, when Murphy, snatching a couple  of bottles from the shelf behind the bar, handed them out to his men,  crying, \"Here, ye bluddy thaves, lave the glasses to the gintlemen!\"    There was no mistaking the insolence in his tone, and the chorus of  derisive yells that answered him showed that his remark had gone to the  spot.    Yankee Jim, who had kept close to Black Hugh, saw the veins in his  neck beginning to swell, and face to grow dark. He was longing to be  at Murphy's throat. \"Speak him fair,\" he said, in a low tone, \"there's  rather a good string of 'em raound.\" Macdonald Dubh glanced about him.  His eye fell on his boy, and for the first time his face became anxious.  \"Ranald,\" he said, angrily, \"take yourself out of this. It is no place  for you whatever.\" The boy, a slight lad of seventeen, but tall and  well-knit, and with his father's fierce, wild, dark face, hesitated.    \"Go,\" said his father, giving him a slight cuff.    \"Here, boy!\" yelled LeNoir, catching him by the arm and holding the  bottle to his mouth, \"drink.\" The boy took a gulp, choked, and spat  it out. LeNoir and his men roared. \"Dat good whiskey,\" he cried, still  holding the boy. \"You not lak dat, hey?\"    \"No,\" said the boy, \"it is not good at all.\"    \"Try heem some more,\" said LeNoir, thrusting the bottle at him again.    \"I will not,\" said Ranald, looking at LeNoir straight and fearless.    \"Ho-ho! mon brave enfant! But you have not de good mannere. Come,  drink!\" He caught the boy by the back of the neck, and made as if to  pour the whiskey down his throat. Black Hugh, who had been kept back by  Yankee Jim all this time, started forward, but before he could take a  second step Ranald, squirming round like a cat, had sunk his teeth into  LeNoir's wrist. With a cry of rage and pain LeNoir raised the bottle and  was bringing it down on Ranald's head, when Black Hugh, with one hand,  caught the falling blow, and with the other seized Ranald, and crying,  \"Get out of this!\" he flung him towards the door. Then turning to  LeNoir, he said, with surprising self-control, \"It is myself that is  sorry that a boy of mine should be guilty of biting like a dog.\"    \"Sa-c-r-re le chien!\" yelled LeNoir, shaking off Macdonald Dubh; \"he is  one dog, and the son "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#2)"],[1," clue in this envelope. He says so  in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he  thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it--and  he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very  common book.\"    \"What you say certainly sounds plausible.\"    \"So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in  double columns and in common use.\"    \"The Bible!\" I cried triumphantly.    \"Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even  if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume  which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty's  associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he  could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination.  This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that  his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.\"    \"But very few books would correspond with that.\"    \"Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to  standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.\"    \"Bradshaw!\"    \"There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous  and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself  to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The  dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is  left?\"    \"An almanac!\"    \"Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the  spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's Almanac. It  is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double  column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I  remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.\" He picked the volume  from his desk. \"Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of  print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British  India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not,  I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven  is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant  to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the  Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are  undone, my good Watson! It is finished!\"    He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows  bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy,  staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation  from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a  second yellow-covered volume in his hand.    \"We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!\" he cried. \"We are  before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of  January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than  likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would  have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us  see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is 'There,'  which is much more promising. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is  'is'--'There is' \"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his  thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words--\"'danger.' Ha!  Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There is danger--may--come--very  soon--one.' Then we have the name 'Douglas'--'rich--country--now--at  Birlstone--House--Birlstone--confidence--is--pressing.' There, Watson!  What do you think of pure reason and its fruit? If the green-grocer had  such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.\"    I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he  deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.    \"What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!\" said I.    \"On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,\" said Holmes. \"When  you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning,  you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave  something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is  perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas,  whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is  sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to 'confident'--that it  is pressing. There is our result--and a very workmanlike little bit of  analysis it was!\"    Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,  even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he  aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open  the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the  room.    Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec MacDonald  was far from having attained the national fame which he has now  achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who  had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted  to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical  strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no  less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his  bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a  hard Aberdonian accent.    Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,  his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For  this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur  colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which  he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher  than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had  talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there  was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood  alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was  not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and  smiled at the sight of him.    \"You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\" said he. \"I wish you luck with your  worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.\"    \"If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,  I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes,\" the inspector answered, with a knowing grin.  \"Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I won't  smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way; for the early  hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your  own self. But--but--\"    The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of  absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon  which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.    \"Douglas!\" he stammered. \"Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it's  witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those  names?\"    \"It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But  why--what's amiss with the names?\"    The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment.  \"Just this,\" said he, \"that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was  horribly murdered last night!\"          Chapter 2--Sherlock Holmes Discourses        It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It  would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited  by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in  his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long  overstimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual  perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the  horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face  showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees  the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.    \"Remarkable!\" said he. \"Remarkable!\"    \"You don't seem surprised.\"    \"Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised?  I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be  important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within  an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that  the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not  surprised.\"    In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about  the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and  his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.    \"I was going down to Birlstone this morning,\" said he. \"I had come to  ask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here. But from  what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.\"    \"I rather think not,\" said Holmes.    \"Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!\" cried the inspector. \"The papers will be full  of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the mystery  if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it  occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will  follow.\"    \"No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the  so-called Porlock?\"    MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. \"Posted  in Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not  much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him money?\"    \"Twice.\"    \"And how?\"    \"In notes to Camberwell post office.\"    \"Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?\"    \"No.\"    The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. \"Why not?\"    \"Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I  would not try to trace him.\"    \"You think there is someone behind him?\"    \"I know there is.\"    \"This professor that I've heard you mention?\"    \"Exactly!\"    Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced  towards me. \"I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in "]]]
