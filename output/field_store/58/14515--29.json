(Here again all three \"a's\" are short.)    As with the final \"a\" in \"Vijayanagara,\" so with the final \"u\" in  such names as \"Kondavidu\" -- it has been dropped in order to avoid  an appearance of pedantry; and I have preferred the more common  \"Rajahmundry\" to the more correct \"Rajamahendri,\" \"Trichinopoly\" to  \"Tiruchhinapalle,\" and so on.    This system may not be very scientific, but I trust it will prove  not unacceptable.    * * *    The name of the capital is spelt in many different ways by the  chroniclers and travellers. The usual Portuguese spelling was  \"Bisnaga;\" but we have also the forms \"Bicheneger\" (NIKITIN),  \"Bidjanagar\" (ABDUR RAZZAK), \"Bizenegalia\" (CONTI), \"Bisnagar,\"  \"Beejanuggur,\" &c.

In the year 1336 A.D., during the reign of Edward III. of England,  there occurred in India an event which almost instantaneously changed  the political condition of the entire south. With that date the volume  of ancient history in that tract closes and the modern begins. It is  the epoch of transition from the Old to the New.    This event was the foundation of the city and kingdom of  Vijayanagar. Prior to A.D. 1336 all Southern India had lain under  the domination of the ancient Hindu kingdoms, -- kingdoms so old  that their origin has never been traced, but which are mentioned in  Buddhist edicts rock-cut sixteen centuries earlier; the Pandiyans at  Madura, the Cholas at Tanjore, and others. When Vijayanagar sprang  into existence the past was done with for ever, and the monarchs  of the new state became lords or overlords of the territories lying  between the Dakhan and Ceylon.    There was no miracle in this. It was the natural result of the  persistent efforts made by the Muhammadans to conquer all India. When  these dreaded invaders reached the Krishna River the Hindus to their  south, stricken with terror, combined, and gathered in haste to the  new standard which alone seemed to offer some hope of protection. The  decayed old states crumbled away into nothingness, and the fighting  kings of Vijayanagar became the saviours of the south for two and a  half centuries.    And yet in the present day the very existence of this kingdom is  hardly remembered in India; while its once magnificent capital,  planted on the extreme northern border of its dominions and bearing  the proud title of the \"City of Victory,\" has entirely disappeared  save for a few scattered ruins of buildings that were once temples  or palaces, and for the long lines of massive walls that constituted  its defences. Even the name has died out of men's minds and memories,  and the remains that mark its site are known only as the ruins lying  near the little village of Hampe.    Its rulers, however, in their day swayed the destinies of an empire  far larger than Austria, and the city is declared by a succession of  European visitors in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to have  been marvellous for size and prosperity -- a city with which for  richness and magnificence no known western capital could compare. Its  importance is shown by the fact that almost all the struggles of the  Portuguese on the western coast were carried on for the purpose of  securing its maritime trade; and that when the empire fell in 1565,  the prosperity of Portuguese Goa fell with it never to rise again.    Our very scanty knowledge of the events that succeeded one another in  the large area dominated by the kings of Vijayanagar has been hitherto  derived partly from the scattered remarks of European travellers  and the desultory references in their writings to the politics of  the inhabitants of India; partly from the summaries compiled by  careful mediaeval historians such as Barros, Couto, and Correa, who,  though to a certain degree interested in the general condition of  the country, yet confined themselves mostly to recording the deeds  of the European colonisers for the enlightenment of their European  readers; partly from the chronicles of a few Muhammadan writers  of the period, who often wrote in fear of the displeasure of their  own lords; and partly from Hindu inscriptions recording grants of  lands to temples and religious institutions, which documents, when  viewed as state papers, seldom yield us more than a few names and  dates. The two chronicles, however, translated and printed at the  end of this volume, will be seen to throw a flood of light upon the  condition of the city of Vijayanagar early in the sixteenth century,  and upon the history of its successive dynasties; and for the rest  I have attempted, as an introduction to these chronicles, to collect  all available materials from the different authorities alluded to and  to weld them into a consecutive whole, so as to form a foundation  upon which may hereafter be constructed a regular history of the  Vijayanagar empire. The result will perhaps seem disjointed, crude,  and uninteresting; but let it be remembered that it is only a first  attempt. I have little doubt that before very long the whole history of  Southern India will be compiled by some writer gifted with the power  of \"making the dry bones live;\" but meanwhile the bones themselves  must be collected and pieced together, and my duty has been to try  and construct at least the main portions of the skeleton.    Before proceeding to details we must shortly glance at the political  condition of India in the first half of the fourteenth century,  remembering that up to that time the Peninsula had been held by a  number of distinct Hindu kingdoms, those of the Pandiyans at Madura  and of the Cholas at Tanjore being the most important.    The year 1001 A.D. saw the first inroad into India of the Muhammadans  from over the north-west border, under their great leader Mahmud of  Ghazni. He invaded first the plains of the Panjab, then Multan, and  afterwards other places. Year after year he pressed forward and again  retired. In 1021 he was at Kalinga; in 1023 in Kathiawar; but in no  case did he make good his foothold on the country. His expeditions  were raids and nothing more. Other invasions, however, followed in  quick succession, and after the lapse of two centuries the Muhammadans  were firmly and permanently established at Delhi. War followed war,  and from that period Northern India knew no rest. At the end of the  thirteenth century the Muhammadans began to press southwards into  the Dakhan. In 1293 Ala-ud-din Khilji, nephew of the king of Delhi,  captured Devagiri. Four years later Gujarat was attacked. In 1303  the reduction of Warangal was attempted. In 1306 there was a fresh  expedition to Devagiri. In 1309 Malik Kafur, the celebrated general,  with an immense force swept into the Dakhan and captured Warangal. The  old capital of the Hoysala Ballalas at Dvarasamudra was taken in  1310, and Malik Kafur went to the Malabar coast where he erected a  mosque, and afterwards returned to his master with enormous booty.[6]  Fresh fighting took place in 1312. Six years later Mubarak of Delhi  marched to Devagiri and inhumanly flayed alive its unfortunate prince,  Haripala Deva, setting up his head at the gate of his own city. In  1323 Warangal fell.    Thus the period at which our history opens, about the year 1330, found  the whole of Northern India down to the Vindhya mountains firmly  under Moslem rule, while the followers of that faith had overrun  the Dakhan and were threatening the south with the same fate. South  of the Krishna the whole country was still under Hindu domination,  but the supremacy of the old dynasties was shaken to its base by the  rapidly advancing terror from the north. With the accession in 1325 of  Muhammad Taghlaq of Delhi things became worse still. Marvellous stories  of his extraordinary proceedings circulated amongst the inhabitants  of the Peninsula, and there seemed to be no bound to his intolerance,  ambition, and ferocity.    Everything, therefore, seemed to be leading up to but one  inevitable end -- the ruin and devastation of the Hindu provinces;  the annihilation of their old royal houses, the destruction of their  religion, their temples, their cities. All that the dwellers in the  south held most dear seemed tottering to its fall.    Suddenly, about the year 1344 A.D., there was a check to this wave  of foreign invasion -- a stop -- a halt -- then a solid wall of  opposition; and for 250 years Southern India was saved.    The check was caused by a combination of small Hindu states -- two  of them already defeated, Warangal and Dvarasamudra -- defeated,  and therefore in all probability not over-confident; the third, the  tiny principality of Anegundi. The solid wall consisted of Anegundi  grown into the great empire of the Vijayanagar. To the kings of this  house all the nations of the south submitted.    If a straight line be drawn on the map of India from Bombay to Madras,  about half-way across will be found the River Tungabhadra, which,  itself a combination of two streams running northwards from Maisur,  flows in a wide circuit north and east to join the Krishna not far from  Kurnool. In the middle of its course the Tungabhadra cuts through a  wild rocky country lying about forty miles north-west of Bellary, and  north of the railway line which runs from that place to Dharwar. At  this point, on the north bank of the river, there existed about the  year 1330 a fortified town called Anegundi, the \"Nagundym\" of our  chronicles, which was the residence of a family of chiefs owning a  small state in the neighbourhood.

The reader of my \"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and  Yucatan,\" may remember that the researches of Mr. Catherwood and myself  in the last-mentioned country were abruptly terminated by the illness  of the former. During our short sojourn in Yucatan, we received vague,  but, at the same time, reliable intelligence of the existence of  numerous and extensive cities, desolate and in ruins which induced us  to believe that the country presented a greater field for antiquarian  research and discoveries than any we had yet visited. Under these  circumstances, it was a severe hardship that we were compelled to leave  it, and our only consolation in doing so was the hope of being able to  return, prepared to make a thorough exploration of this unknown and  mysterious region. In about a year we found ourselves in a condition to  do so; and on Monday, the ninth of October, we put to sea on board the  bark Tennessee, Scholefield master, for Sisal, the port from which we  had sailed on our return to the United States.    The Tennessee was a down-Easter of two hundred and sixty tons burden,  turned out apparently from one of those great factories where ships are  built by the mile and chopped off to order, but stout, strong, well  manned and equipped.    Her cargo was assorted for the Yucatan market, and consisted of a heavy  stratum of iron at the bottom; midway were miscellanies, among which  were cotton, muskets, and two hundred barrels of turpentine; and on  top, within reach of the hatches, were six hundred kegs of gunpowder.    We had a valuable addition to our party in Dr. Cabot, of Boston, who  accompanied us as an amateur, particularly as an ornithologist. Besides  him, our only fellow-passenger was Mr. Camerden, who went out as  supercargo.    The first morning out we woke with an extraordinary odour of  turpentine, giving us apprehensions that a barrel had sprung a leak,  which, by means of the cotton, might use up our gunpowder before it  came to the hands of its consignee. This odour, however, was traced to  a marking-pot, which quieted our apprehensions.    On the evening of the fourth day we had a severe thunder-storm. This  was an old acquaintance of ours in the tropics, but one which at that  time we were not disposed to welcome very cordially. Peals of thunder  broke and crashed close over our heads, lightning flashed across the  dark vault of the heavens, lighting up the surface of the water, and  making fearfully visible our little vessel, tossing and pitching, a  mere speck in immensity; and at times an angry ray darted toward the  horizon, as if expressly to ignite our gunpowder. We discussed, though  rather disjointedly, the doctrine of conductors and non-conductors, and  advised the captain to put a few links of a chain cable round the  mainmast, and carry the end of it over the side. We had some  consolation in thinking that six hundred kegs were no worse than sixty,  and that six would do our business; but, in fact, at the moment, we  were very much of opinion that lightning and gunpowder were the only  dangers of the sea. The night, however, wore through, and morning  brought with it the usual, and, unhappily, almost the only change in  those who go down to the sea in ships--forgetfulness of past danger.    On the evening of the seventeenth we passed, with a gentle breeze, the  narrow passage known as the Hole in the Wall, and before morning we  were lying broadside to the wind, and almost flying before it. The gale  was terrific; nothing could stand upright to windward, and the sea was  portentous. The captain sat under the quarter rail, watching the  compass, and turning anxiously to the misty quarter of the heavens from  which the winds seemed let loose. At breakfast large drops of sweat  stood on his forehead; and though at first unwilling to admit it even  to himself, we discovered that we were really in danger. We were  driving, as fast as the wind could send us, upon the range of sunken  rocks known as Abaco reef. Directly under our lee was the worst part of  the whole reef, marked on the chart \"Dangerous rocky shore.\" Unless the  gale abated or the wind hauled, in eight or ten hours we must strike. I  must confess I saw but little hope of a change, and this rocky reef was  but a few feet under water, and twenty miles distant from terra firma.  If the vessel struck, she must go to pieces; nothing made by man's  hands could stand against the fury of the sea, and every moment we were  nearer destruction. We sat with the chart before us, looking at it as a  sentenced convict might look at an advertisement of the time fixed for  his execution. The sunken rocks seemed to stand out"]]]
