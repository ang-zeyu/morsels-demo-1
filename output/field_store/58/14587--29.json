When we reflect upon the great celebrity of the \"Life, Exploits, and  Adventures of that ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote de la Mancha,\" and  how his name has become quite proverbial amongst us, it seems strange  that so little should be known concerning the great man to whose  imagination we are indebted for so amusing and instructive a tale. We  cannot better introduce our present edition than by a short sketch of  his life, adding a few remarks on the work itself and the present  adapted reprint of it.    The obscurity we have alluded to is one which Cervantes shares with  many others, some of them the most illustrious authors which the world  ever produced. Homer, Hesiod,--names with which the mouths of men have  been familiar for centuries,--how little is now known of them! And not  only so, but how little was known of them even by those who lived  comparatively close upon their own time! How scattered and  unsatisfactory are the few particulars which we have of the life of  our own poet William Shakspere!      Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was born at Alcala de Henares, a town of  New Castile, famous for its University, founded by Cardinal Ximenes.  He was of gentle birth, both on his father's and mother's side.  Rodrigo de Cervantes, his father, was descended from an ancient family  of Galicia, of which several branches were settled in some of the  principal cities of Spain. His mother's name was Leonora de  Cort[=e]nas. We find by the parish register of Santa Maria la Mayor,  at Alcala de Henares, that Miguel was baptised in that church on  Sunday, the 9th of October, 1547; in which year we may conclude,  therefore, that he was born. The discovery of this baptismal register  set at rest a dispute which had for some time been going on between  _seven_ different cities, each of which claimed the honour of being  the native place of our author: these were, besides the one already  mentioned, Seville, Madrid, Esquivias, Toledo, Lucena, and Alcazar de  San Juan. In this respect we cannot avoid drawing a comparison between  the fame of Cervantes and the prince of poets, Homer.    From a child he discovered a great liking for books, which no doubt  determined his parents, whose fortune, notwithstanding their good  family, was any thing but affluent, to educate him for one of the  learned professions, by which alone at that time there was any chance  of getting wealth. Miguel, however, did not take to the strict studies  proposed to him: not that he was idle; his days were spent in reading  books of amusement, such as novels, romances, and poems. It was of the  materials afforded by such a pursuit that his fame was afterwards  built.    Cervantes continued at Madrid till he was in his twenty-first year,  during which time he remained with his learned tutor Juan Lopez de  Hoyos. He seems to have been a great favourite with him; for, in a  collection of \"Luctus,\" published by Juan on the death of the Queen,  we find an elegy and a ballad contributed by the editor's \"dear and  beloved disciple Miguel de Cervantes.\" Under the same editorial care  Cervantes himself tells us, in his _Viage de Parnasso_, that he  published a pastoral poem of some length, called 'Filena,' besides  several ballads, sonnets, canzonets, and other small poems.    Notwithstanding the comparative insignificance of these productions,  they probably excited some little attention; for it appears not  unlikely that it was to them that Cervantes owed his appointment to an  office, which we find him holding, in 1569, at Rome,--that of  chamberlain to his eminence the Cardinal Julio Aquaviva, an  ecclesiastic of considerable learning. Such an appointment, however,  did not suit the active disposition and romantic turn of one so deeply  read in the adventures of the old knights, the glory of which he  longed to share; from which hope, however, the inactivity and monotony  of a court-life could not but exclude him.    In 1571 there was concluded a famous league between Pope Pius V.,  Philip II. of Spain, and the Venetian Republic, against Selim, the  Grand Turk, who was attacking Cyprus, then belonging to Venice. John  of Austria, natural son of the celebrated Emperor Charles V., and  brother of the king of Spain, was made commander-in-chief of the  allied forces, both naval and military; and under him, as general of  the Papal forces, was appointed Mario Antonio Colonna, Duke of  Paliano. It became fashionable for the young men of the time to enlist  in this expedition; and Cervantes, then about twenty-four years of  age, soon enrolled himself under the standard of the Roman general.  After various success on both sides, in which the operations of the  Christians were not a little hindered by the dissensions of their  commanders, to which the taking of Nicosia by the Turks may be  imputed, the first year's cruise ended with the famous battle of  Lepanto; after which the allied forces retired, and wintered at  Messina.    Cervantes was present at this famous victory, where he was wounded in  the left hand by a blow from a scymitar, or, as some assert, by a  gunshot, so severely, that he was obliged to have it amputated at the  wrist whilst in the hospital at Messina; but the operation was so  unskilfully performed, that he lost the use of the entire arm ever  afterwards. He was not discouraged by this wound, nor induced to give  up his profession as a soldier. Indeed, he seems, from his own words,  to be very proud of the honour which his loss conferred upon him. \"My  wound,\" he says, \"was received on the most glorious occasion that any  age, past or present, ever saw, or that the future can ever hope to  see. To those who barely behold them, indeed, my wounds may not seem  honourable; it is by those who know how I came by them that they will  be rightly esteemed.

His familiarity is suited to his correspondent; he affects no  rudeness. The terms of civility or affection which he employs towards  his correspondents are sober, measured, appropriate to each, and honest  in their simplicity and cordiality. When he speaks of morals and the  family, he seems at times like the patriarchs of the Bible. His command  of language is complete, and he never fails to avail himself of it. Now  and then a coarse word, a few personalities, too bitter and quite unjust  or injurious, will have to be suppressed in printing; time, however, as  it passes away, permits many things and renders them inoffensive. Am I  right in saying that Proudhon's correspondence, always substantial, will  one day be the most accessible and attractive portion of his works?\"      Almost the whole of Proudhon's real biography is included in his  correspondence. Up to 1837, the date of the first letter which we have  been able to collect, his life, narrated by Sainte Beuve, from whom we  make numerous extracts, may be summed up in a few pages.    Pierre Joseph Proudhon was born on the 15th of January, 1809, in  a suburb of Besancon, called Mouillere. His father and mother were  employed in the great brewery belonging to M. Renaud. His father, though  a cousin of the jurist Proudhon, the celebrated professor in the faculty  of Dijon, was a journeyman brewer. His mother, a genuine peasant, was a  common servant. She was an orderly person of great good sense; and, as  they who knew her say, a superior woman of HEROIC character,--to use the  expression of the venerable M. Weiss, the librarian at Besancon. She  it was especially that Proudhon resembled: she and his grandfather  Tournesi, the soldier peasant of whom his mother told him, and whose  courageous deeds he has described in his work on \"Justice.\" Proudhon,  who always felt a great veneration for his mother Catharine, gave  her name to the elder of his daughters. In 1814, when Besancon was  blockaded, Mouillere, which stood in front of the walls of the town, was  destroyed in the defence of the place; and Proudhon's father established  a cooper's shop in a suburb of Battant, called Vignerons. Very honest,  but simple-minded and short-sighted, this cooper, the father of five  children, of whom Pierre Joseph was the eldest, passed his life in  poverty. At eight years of age, Proudhon either made himself useful in  the house, or tended the cattle out of doors. No one should fail to read  that beautiful and precious page of his work on \"Justice,\" in which he  describes the rural sports which he enjoyed when a neatherd. At the age  of twelve, he was a cellar-boy in an inn. This, however, did not prevent  him from studying.    His mother was greatly aided by M. Renaud, the former owner of the  brewery, who had at that time retired from business, and was engaged in  the education of his children.    Proudhon entered school as a day-scholar in the sixth class. He was  necessarily irregular in his attendance; domestic cares and restraints  sometimes kept him from his classes. He succeeded nevertheless in his  studies; he showed great perseverance. His family were so poor that they  could not afford to furnish him with books; he was obliged to borrow  them from his comrades, and copy the text of his lessons. He has himself  told us that he was obliged to leave his wooden shoes outside the door,  that he might not disturb the classes with his noise; and that, having  no hat, he went to school bareheaded. One day, towards the close of his  studies, on returning from the distribution of the prizes, loaded with  crowns, he found nothing to eat in the house.      \"In his eagerness for labor and his thirst for knowledge, Proudhon,\"  says Sainte Beuve, \"was not content with the instruction of his  teachers. From his twelfth to his fourteenth year, he was a constant  frequenter of the town library. One curiosity led to another, and he  called for book after book, sometimes eight or ten at one sitting. The  learned librarian, the friend and almost the brother of Charles Nodier,  M. Weiss, approached him one day, and said, smiling, 'But, my little  friend, what do you wish to do with all these books?' The child raised  his head, eyed his questioner, and replied: 'What's that to you?' And  the good M. Weiss remembers it to this day.\"      Forced to earn his living, Proudhon could not continue his studies. He  entered a printing-office in Besancon as a proof-reader. Becoming,  soon after, a compositor, he made a tour of France in this capacity. At  Toulon, where he found himself without money and without work, he had a  scene with the mayor, which he describes in his work on \"Justice.\"    Sainte Beuve says that, after his tour of France, his service book being  filled with good certificates, Proudhon was promoted to the position  of foreman. But he does not tell us, for the reason that he had no  knowledge of a letter written by Fallot, of which we never heard until  six months since, that the printer at that time contemplated quitting  his trade in order to become a teacher.    Towards 1829, Fallot, who was a little older than Proudhon, and  who, after having obtained the Suard pension in 1832, died in his  twenty-ninth year, while filling the position of assistant librarian at  the Institute, was charged, Protestant though he was, with the revisal  of a \"Life of the Saints,\" which was published at Besancon. The book was  in Latin, and Fallot added some notes which also were in Latin.      \"But,\" says Sainte Beuve, \"it happened that some errors escaped his  attention, which Proudhon, then proof-reader in the printing office,  did not fail to point out to him. Surprised at finding so good a Latin  scholar in a workshop, he desired to make his acquaintance; and soon  there sprung up between them a most earnest and intimate friendship: a  friendship of the intellect and of the heart.\"    Addressed to a printer between twenty-two and twenty-three years of age,  and predicting in formal terms his future fame, Fallot's letter seems to  us so interesting that we do not hesitate to reproduce it entire.      \"PARIS, December 5, 1831.    \"MY DEAR PROUDHON,--YOU have a right to be surprised at, and even  dissatisfied with, my long delay in replying to your kind letter; I will  tell you the cause of it. It became necessary to forward an account of  your ideas to M. J. de Gray; to hear his objections, to reply to them,  and to await his definitive response, which reached me but a short time  ago; for M. J. is a sort of financial king, who takes no pains to be  punctual in dealing with poor devils like ourselves. I, too, am careless  in matters of business; I sometimes push my negligence even to disorder,  and the metaphysical musings which continually occupy my mind, added to  the amusements of Paris, render me the most incapable man in the world  for conducting a negotiation with despatch.    \"I have M. Jobard's decision; here it is: In his judgment, you are  too learned and clever for his children; he fears that you could not  accommodate your mind and character to the childish notions common  to their age and station. In short, he is what the world calls a good  father; that is, he wants to spoil his children, and, in order to do  this easily, he thinks fit to retain his present instructor, who is not  very learned, but who takes part in their games and joyous sports with  wonderful facility, who points out the letters of the alphabet to  the little girl, who takes the little boys to mass, and who, no less  obliging than the worthy Abbe P. of our acquaintance, would readily  dance for Madame's amusement. Such a profession would not suit you, you  who have a free, proud, and manly soul: you are refused; let us dismiss  the matter from our minds. Perhaps another time my solicitude will be  less unfortunate. I can only ask your pardon for having thought of thus  disposing of you almost without consulting you. I find my excuse in the  motives which guided me; I had in view your well-being and advancement  in the ways of this world.    \"I see in your letter, my comrade, through its brilliant witticisms and  beneath the frank and artless gayety with which you have sprinkled it,  a tinge of sadness and despondency which pains me. You are unhappy, my  friend: your present situation does not suit you; you cannot remain in  it, it was not made for you, it is beneath you; you ought, by all  means, to leave it, before its injurious influence begins to affect your  faculties, and before you become settled, as they say, in the ways of  your profession, were it possible that such a thing could ever happen,  which I flatly deny. You are unhappy; you have not yet entered upon the  path which Nature has marked out for you. But, faint-hearted soul, is  that a cause for despondency? Ought you to feel discouraged? Struggle,  morbleu, struggle persistently, and you will triumph. J. J. Rousseau  groped about for forty years before his genius was revealed to him.  You are not J. J Rousseau; but listen: I know not whether I should have  divined the author of \"Emile\" when he was twenty years of age, supposing  that I had been his contemporary, and had enjoyed the honor of his  acquaintance. But I have known you, I have loved you, I have divined  your future, if I may venture to say so; for the first time in my life,  I am going to risk a prophecy. Keep this letter, read it again fifteen  or twenty years hence, perhaps twenty-five, and if at that time the  prediction which I am about to make has not been fulfilled, burn it as  a piece of folly out of charity and respect for my memory. This is my  prediction: you will be, Proudhon, in spite of yourself, inevitably,  by the fact of your destiny, a writer, an author; you will be a  philosopher; you will be one of the lights"]]]
