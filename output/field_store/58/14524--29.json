S and 5 mi. W Reva--six in late June and two in early  August. Probably this bat will be found in rocky areas elsewhere in the  county. One specimen taken on June 23 was molting over much of the body.      ~Myotis lucifugus carissima~ Thomas, 1904    Little Brown Myotis    _Specimens examined_ (27).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 1; NW 1/4 sec. 15,  R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 4; NE 1/4 sec. 24, R. 8 E, T. 21 N, 20; 4 mi. S, 7 mi.  W Ladner, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 1.    This bat is widely distributed in northwestern South Dakota and was the  only species of _Myotis_ reported by Visher (1914:91) in his early  natural history survey of Harding County. We took specimens from several  of the wooded buttes and also in areas well-removed from timber; one was  shot, for example, as it foraged over the Little Missouri River in the  extreme western part of the county. On May 28, 1968, a barn was located  in which an incipient maternal colony (several hundred adult females)  roosted between double rafters supporting a metal roof. The owner of the  barn, Robert Parks of Ralph, stated that bats have utilized this place  as a summer roost for several years. The barn stands adjacent to the  nearly treeless Big Nasty Creek, which flows through the hilly terrain  of the northeastern section of the county.    Fourteen of 20 females taken from the colony each carried a single  embryo (crown-rump lengths measured 2 to 11 with a mean of 5.4). The  other six were not visibly pregnant upon gross examination but had  enlarged uteri, possibly indicating recent implantation. Of the  remaining females from Harding County, three collected on May 29 had  enlarged uteri, whereas two collected in late June evidenced no gross  reproductive activity. A male obtained May 29 had testes that measured  4.    Ectoparasites obtained from this species include chiggers,  _Leptotrombidium myotis_ (Ewing), a tick, _Ornithodoros kelleyi_ Cooley  and Kohls, fleas, _Myodopsylla gentilis_ Jordan and Rothschild and _M.  insignis_ (Rothschild), and an unidentified species of mite.      ~Myotis volans interior~ Miller, 1914    Long-legged Myotis    _Specimens examined_ (43).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 4; NW 1/4 sec. 15,  R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 12; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 27.    The long-legged myotis is one of the commonest bats of the wooded  buttes, accounting for almost half of all chiropterans taken in these  areas. Most of our specimens were shot as they foraged among trees and  over water in the evening; a few were captured in mist nets.    Uteri of eight females obtained in the period May 23 to 31 were  enlarged; two females collected on June 29 carried single embryos that  measured 20 and 22. A lactating female was taken on August 3, but three  other adult females taken early in the same month evidenced no  reproductive activity. Testes measured 2 to 4 in three May-taken males  and 4 in each of two from June.    Two males obtained June 16 and 23 were molting as evidenced by new hairs  under the old pelage over much of the body.    _Myotis volans_ that we examined for ectoparasites harbored chiggers,  _Leptotrombidium myotis_ (Ewing), and fleas, _Myodopsylla gentilis_  Jordan and Rothschild.      ~Lasionycteris noctivagans~ (LeConte, 1831)    Silver-haired Bat    A single female, which contained two embryos that measured 4, represents  the only record of a silver-haired bat from Harding County. This  specimen was shot at dusk on June 1, 1968, as it foraged over a small  pond in Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes (10 mi. S and 5 mi. W Reva).  Several other bats believed to be of this species were seen at the same  place that evening. We initially assumed that these were late migrants,  but recent findings indicate that this species is a common summer  inhabitant of the Long Pine Hills in adjacent Carter County, Montana,  and likely, therefore, also a resident in favored sites in Harding  County.      ~Eptesicus fuscus pallidus~ Young, 1908    Big Brown Bat    _Specimens examined_ (11).--NW 1/4 sec. 15, R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 3; 7 mi. N,  2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3300 ft., 2; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 6.    The big brown bat is a common inhabitant of the Slim Buttes and North  Cave Hills, where individuals were shot or netted as they foraged over  water or among trees late in the evening.    Two May-taken females had enlarged uteri and one taken on July 8 was  lactating. The testes of a May-taken male measured 5, whereas those of  one obtained in early July measured 9. One of two males shot on August 4  was a young of the year; the other, an adult, was in fresh pelage as was  an adult male shot on July 8. The July-taken lactating female and three  June-taken specimens were in old pelage. Several specimens were  parasitized on the ears by chiggers, _Leptotrombidium myotis_ (Ewing).      ~Lasiurus cinereus cinereus~ (Palisot de Beauvois, 1796)    Hoary Bat    The hoary bat seemingly is an uncommon summer resident of Harding County  as but one specimen, a non-pregnant female, has been taken there. This  bat was shot on the evening of June 22, 1961, in the Slim Buttes as it  foraged over a small pond in Deer Draw (10 mi. S and 5 mi. W Reva).      ~Plecotus townsendii pallescens~ (Miller, 1897)    Townsend's Big-eared Bat    _Specimens examined_ (4).--2 mi. S, 3-1/4 mi. W Ludlow (Ludlow Cave), 2  (1 SDSU); 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 2.    This big-eared bat evidently is uncommon in northwestern South Dakota.  Of the four specimens examined, two were taken at Ludlow Cave and two  were taken in June in the southern part of Slim Buttes--a female shot as  it foraged over a pond in Deer Draw and another female netted over a  water tank at Summit Spring about a half mile south of Deer Draw.    Ludlow Cave, in the caprock on the southeastern edge of the North Cave  Hills, was formed by water erosion, resulting in numerous pockets and  crevises in the ceiling and walls. The cave faces northwest; the mouth  measures approximately 10 feet in diameter. A few feet from the entrance  the cave narrows and approximately 50 feet back it is no more than three  feet in diameter, although in the first 30 feet or so the ceiling varies  from 10 to 15 feet in height. A thorough search of this cave on June 18,  1961, revealed one bat, a male _Plecotus_, which was shot from the  ceiling about 15 feet from the entrance. No bats were found when the  cave was visited on May 16 and again on June 4, 1968. Visher (1914:92)  reported that several _Plecotus_ were found there in early September,  1912. Probably Ludlow Cave, along with the several abandoned coal mines  in the county, serves as a hibernaculum for some species of bats.      Order Lagomorpha      ~Lepus townsendii campanius~ Hollister, 1915    White-tailed Jack Rabbit    _Specimens examined_ (15).--NW 1/4 sec. 23, R. 1 E, T. 23 N, 1; sec. 24,  R. 1 E, T. 22 N, 1; 2 mi. N, 2 mi. E Ladner, 1; 4 mi. S, 7 mi. W Ladner,  2; 10 mi. S Ladner, 1; 6 mi. N, 2-1/2 mi. W Camp Crook, 1; 2 mi. N  Buffalo, 1; sec. 30, R. 3 E, T. 19 N, 1; SW 1/4 sec. 26, R. 2 E, T. 19  N, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 3; 12 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 1; 17 mi. S, 4  mi. W Reva, 1.    This jack rabbit is abundant throughout the areas of short grass in the  county and individuals occasionally utilize grassy slopes of buttes.  Extensive favorable habitat and the paucity of natural predators  resulting from control operations probably are the principal factors  favoring the heavy concentrations of this hare noted by all of our field  parties.    A female examined on May 21 carried five fetuses and each of two others  examined late in May carried six; all fetuses were nearly of the same  size (110 to 120) and were completely covered with hair. A female  obtained on May 31 appeared to have recently weaned young and females  examined on June 5 and 17 were lactating. A female shot on June 28 and  another taken on July 12 proved to be approximately half grown,  although young of the year collected on June 16, 26, and 28 were nearly  of adult size.    In late March of 1963, white-tailed jack rabbits were molting to summer  pelage from the white pelage of winter.      ~Sylvilagus audubonii baileyi~ (Merriam, 1897)    Desert Cottontail    _Specimens examined_ (12).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 2; 10 mi. S, 4 mi.  W Ladner, 1; 7 mi. N, 2-1/2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3300 ft., 1; 5 mi. W  Buffalo, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 7.    The desert cottontail is a common inhabitant of the uplands of Harding  County, especially where varied local relief and in some instances  brushy vegetation provide suitable cover. A female shot on May 26 in a  dense stand of pines in the North Cave Hills carried five embryos that  measured 75, another taken on July 4 was pregnant with six embryos that  measured 18, and two females collected on June 16 and another on June 24  carried seven embryos that measured 32, 40, and 45, respectively. Two  subadults collected in late June and two collected in early August were  nearly full grown. The testes of an adult male obtained on March 28  measured 50.    The male mentioned above was completely in winter pelage. Adults taken  on June 16, 23, and 24 had almost completed molt to summer pelage, but  each retained some evidence of active hair replacement, most often over  the shoulders; a pregnant female obtained on July 4 had only partially  completed the molt to summer pelage. An adult female in summer pelage  that was taken on August 4 was inexplicably molting on the sides and  over the shoulders.    A May-taken female was parasitized by fleas, _Cediopsylla inaequalis_  (Baker).      ~Sylvilagus floridanus similis~ Nelson, 1907    Eastern Cottontail    _Specimens examined_ (2).--4 mi. S, 7 mi. W Ladner, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W  Reva, 1.    This rabbit is uncommon in northwestern South Dakota and evidently is  strictly associated with riparian habitats. Our only specimens were  taken along the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#2)"],[1,"before him.    \"Sir, do you recognize this card?\" The question came like a musket shot,  and a card dropped, face upwards, on the Secretary's knee. Kellar could  not have performed this feat more neatly.    The Secretary glanced at the pasteboard for a moment, and said in  evident surprise:    \"Why, yes. It is one of my cards.\"    \"Have you any more with you?\" asked Inspector Byrnes, speaking for the  first time.    The Secretary seemed puzzled, but good-naturedly opened his wallet, and  produced several of the same description. These he handed to the  Inspector, who took them and bowed profoundly. A moment was spent in  intense examination.    \"You must pardon me if I ask you if you use these cards when calling  upon the President?\" proceeded the Washington officer. The Inspector's  eyes seemed to be still riveted upon the cards in his hands.    \"Why, yes--no--that is, once in a while, if I happen to desire an  audience at an unusual hour,\" answered the Secretary, exhibiting the  first signs of embarrassment.    \"Will you please tell us when you called there last?\" asked Inspector  Byrnes, furtively glancing up and speaking in a chatty, assuring tone.    The Secretary's face expressed relief.    \"Certainly,\" he answered; \"that is easy enough. I attended an informal  reception in the Blue Room from three to four yesterday and saw the  President alone a minute afterward. That is the last time I saw him.\"  One might almost have fancied at the last sentence that tears arose to  the eyes of the cabinet officer; at least there were tears in his voice.    \"Just as a matter of formality, Mr. Secretary, will you tell us where  you were between twelve and two o'clock this morning?\" asked the  Inspector, with the unconscious look of a man who was asking for a glass  of water.    \"What does this mean, sir? Do you suspect me in this infernal mystery?\"  ejaculated the Secretary. His face was pale from excitement; his eyes  flashed in manly protest.    \"Not at all, not at all, sir. Calm yourself. This is only a matter of  curious coincidence and a disagreeable formality,\" answered the  Inspector, waving his hand as if he were brushing away a fly.    The Secretary stood a moment in thought, and then turned and touched a  button. Immediately a servant appeared to whom the Secretary whispered a  few words. The man in livery bowed and went.    \"Now, gentlemen,\" said the Secretary, standing with much dignity before  his callers, \"wait a moment, and so far as I am concerned this mystery  shall be cleared. I happened to be in this room last night from twelve  until half-past two with some gentlemen, whom I am sure you will  recognize. Ah! here they are.\"    A tap at the door and a \"Come in\" revealed to the astonished detectives  the Secretaries of War and of the Interior, who entered the room.    \"Now, Inspector,\" continued the Secretary of State in his grandest  manner, \"will you kindly ask your question again?\"    It then transpired that the three Secretaries had conducted an informal  meeting to confer about the distressing question of war with Canada  which was at that time agitating the country, and that their interview  had been prolonged into the small hours of the morning. The chief of  the Washington police could not refrain from profuse apologies after  this denouement. Inspector Byrnes thought profoundly, and then, after a  pause, burst out with unparalleled frankness:    \"Gentlemen, this is the most startling mystery in the annals of American  crime. I must confess that up to this moment I am absolutely foiled.\" He  then recounted, under seal of secrecy, the whole story as we have seen  it. Ending his exciting narrative, he said:    \"And, Mr. Secretary, do you know of any one in Washington or in the  country that resembles you enough to deceive two men, taking into  account a natural drowsiness that each admitted?\"    The three gentlemen of the Cabinet thought hard but were soon bound to  answer in the negative. For the Secretary of State was no  ordinary-looking man. Conspicuous on any occasion, though not what might  be strictly called handsome, he always commanded attention by his  distinguished air. His luxuriant side whiskers, which were really  magnificent were the most noticeable feature of his face. He had the  happy consciousness that there were none like them in the United States.    \"There is only one more question you can answer, Mr. Secretary,\" said  Inspector Byrnes, with a deferential look. \"The watchman on the first  floor said he recognized your team. Will you please find out whether  your coupe was in or not between twelve and two? Coachmen have queer  tricks at times.\"    The coachman was immediately sent for. Meanwhile the Secretary stated  that he had come in at twelve from a late call on a personal friend.    \"May I ask your friend's name?\" interrupted the national sleuth-hound,  swiftly and politely.    \"The Patagonian Ambassador,\" replied the Secretary with hauteur. He  added that he had sent his carriage instructing John, the family  coachman, to be on hand at eleven that morning. The carriage was  evidently not there, and in the excitement of the news the Secretary had  foregone his morning's Department business.    After half an hour of waiting, during which the two police officers had  sent out several messages, the coachman was ushered in among the  impatient quintet. Instead of the prim and stately master of the horse,  who was the despair of even his co-peer the Jehu of the English  Ambassador, and the admiration of the Washington gamin, there skulked in  a battered, bandaged, hastily-dressed man, who shuffled out incoherent  excuses, and burst into moist apologies.    \"It wasn't my fault. The divil was in it. The hosses are safe. The  kerridge is well. I woke up in the gutter, the blood sputterin' down me  backbone. They were picked up this morning. Don't discharge me! I've  served you fifteen years and only trained twicst. What'll become of me?  Lord have mercy!\" The coachman of the Secretary had a stock of  irreproachable syntax, which had been utterly scattered during the  experience of the last night. At this spontaneous moment his native  grammar got the best of him.    The coachman's testimony amounted to this: The driver was walking his  horses to the stable in the fog when he saw a man beckon him from the  sidewalk. Not a soul was on the street. Beyond was a dark, private lane.  He stopped, and, to his surprise, saw, as he thought, his master  standing and motioning him to come to a halt and get down. The  Secretary's face was turned toward the dark. The voice sounded muffled.  When the coachman alighted his master produced a silver flask and told  him to take a drink as it was so damp. He dared not disobey, though full  of wonder at this unprecedented favor. As soon as he had taken a pull he  felt dizzy. Two or three more black figures appeared like ghosts before  his eyes. He thought he struck out or tried to run to the coach, he  didn't know which. A queer odor mounted to his head. Then he lost  consciousness. He came to, early in the morning, a little after four,  and staggered to the stable. The team was not there. He fell into a  stupor of despair. About an hour after, an acquaintance of his drove the  span up, and said they had been found unchecked, grazing near the  Smithsonian Institute. He supposed that they had run away. The  Secretary's coachman had then given the fellow five dollars for his  services and to hold his tongue. He was afraid of being discharged. He  had just heard of the disappearance of the President and he feared being  implicated in the affair. After the name of the person who found the  horses was taken down, and after a searching cross-examination, the  frightened man was sent away to rest, with assurance of continued favor.  Subsequent examinations failed to find any traces of the catastrophe in  the coupe. It had been carefully cleaned when it came back to the  stable. There was no blood visible.    This completes the whole of the testimony and information that was  received or discovered by the united efforts of all the detectives in  America up to the fourteenth of the month. Clews had been manufactured  and followed with desperate rapidity, but to no avail. Numberless  arrests had been made, but no one could be legally held for high treason  against the Chief Executive. All that was known was this: that some bold  villain had successfully personated the Secretary of State; that he had  gulled three servants by a close resemblance; that he, with others,  probably, had forcibly carried the President and his wife from their  very beds, leaving them but scant time to take the necessary articles of  clothing; that these abductors had audaciously used the State carriage  for their nefarious purpose; that they had left absolutely no trace  behind; and, that moreover, in the darkness of the fog and rain no  further track could be found of the direction they took. They could not  have gone by train; so every house in the city of Washington and in the  suburbs, to the distance of fifteen miles or more, had been searched in  vain. A like systematic investigation was carried on along the river, to  the bay, in search of anything suspicious afloat. The authorities gave  the robbers of the nation no time or opportunity to escape by land or  water. All avenues were watched. Where were they and their noble booty?  In short the foremost couple of the United States had utterly  disappeared, to the horror and despair of the civilized world.    It was just one week from the morning of the shock when the New York  _Herald_ published the following manifesto in its original form. It was  sent as an advertisement with five dollars enclosed. The envelope was  postmarked from division II of the New York Post-office. The document  bore no superscription. It read as follows:         TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:         _We have abducted your President and his"]]]
