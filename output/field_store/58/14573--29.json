In point of geography the lake is called Lake Wissanotti and the river  running out of it the Ossawippi, just as the main street of Mariposa is  called Missinaba Street and the county Missinaba County. But these  names do not really matter. Nobody uses them. People simply speak of the  \"lake\" and the \"river\" and the \"main street,\" much in the same way  as they always call the Continental Hotel, \"Pete Robinson's\" and the  Pharmaceutical Hall, \"Eliot's Drug Store.\" But I suppose this is just  the same in every one else's town as in mine, so I need lay no stress on  it.    The town, I say, has one broad street that runs up from the lake,  commonly called the Main Street. There is no doubt about its width. When  Mariposa was laid out there was none of that shortsightedness which is  seen in the cramped dimensions of Wall Street and Piccadilly. Missinaba  Street is so wide that if you were to roll Jeff Thorpe's barber shop  over on its face it wouldn't reach half way across. Up and down the Main  Street are telegraph poles of cedar of colossal thickness, standing at a  variety of angles and carrying rather more wires than are commonly seen  at a transatlantic cable station.    On the Main Street itself are a number of buildings of extraordinary  importance,--Smith's Hotel and the Continental and the Mariposa House,  and the two banks (the Commercial and the Exchange), to say nothing of  McCarthy's Block (erected in 1878), and Glover's Hardware Store with the  Oddfellows' Hall above it. Then on the \"cross\" street that intersects  Missinaba Street at the main corner there is the Post Office and the  Fire Hall and the Young Men's Christian Association and the office of  the Mariposa Newspacket,--in fact, to the eye of discernment a perfect  jostle of public institutions comparable only to Threadneedle Street or  Lower Broadway. On all the side streets there are maple trees and  broad sidewalks, trim gardens with upright calla lilies, houses with  verandahs, which are here and there being replaced by residences with  piazzas.    To the careless eye the scene on the Main Street of a summer afternoon  is one of deep and unbroken peace. The empty street sleeps in the  sunshine. There is a horse and buggy tied to the hitching post in front  of Glover's hardware store. There is, usually and commonly, the burly  figure of Mr. Smith, proprietor of Smith's Hotel, standing in his  chequered waistcoat on the steps of his hostelry, and perhaps, further  up the street, Lawyer Macartney going for his afternoon mail, or the  Rev. Mr. Drone, the Rural Dean of the Church of England Church, going  home to get his fishing rod after a mothers' auxiliary meeting.    But this quiet is mere appearance. In reality, and to those who know it,  the place is a perfect hive of activity. Why, at Netley's butcher shop  (established in 1882) there are no less than four men working on the  sausage machines in the basement; at the Newspacket office there are  as many more job-printing; there is a long distance telephone with  four distracting girls on high stools wearing steel caps and talking  incessantly; in the offices in McCarthy's block are dentists and lawyers  with their coats off, ready to work at any moment; and from the big  planing factory down beside the lake where the railroad siding is, you  may hear all through the hours of the summer afternoon the long-drawn  music of the running saw.    Busy--well, I should think so! Ask any of its inhabitants if Mariposa  isn't a busy, hustling, thriving town. Ask Mullins, the manager of the  Exchange Bank, who comes hustling over to his office from the Mariposa  House every day at 10.30 and has scarcely time all morning to go out and  take a drink with the manager of the Commercial; or ask--well, for  the matter of that, ask any of them if they ever knew a more rushing  go-a-head town than Mariposa.    Of course if you come to the place fresh from New York, you are  deceived. Your standard of vision is all astray, You do think the place  is quiet. You do imagine that Mr. Smith is asleep merely because he  closes his eyes as he stands. But live in Mariposa for six months or a  year and then you will begin to understand it better; the buildings get  higher and higher; the Mariposa House grows more and more luxurious;  McCarthy's block towers to the sky; the 'buses roar and hum to the  station; the trains shriek; the traffic multiplies; the people move  faster and faster; a dense crowd swirls to and fro in the post-office  and the five and ten cent store--and amusements! well, now! lacrosse,  baseball, excursions, dances, the Fireman's Ball every winter and the  Catholic picnic every summer; and music--the town band in the park every  Wednesday evening, and the Oddfellows' brass band on the street every  other Friday; the Mariposa Quartette, the Salvation Army--why, after a  few months' residence you begin to realize that the place is a mere mad  round of gaiety.    In point of population, if one must come down to figures, the Canadian  census puts the numbers every time at something round five thousand. But  it is very generally understood in Mariposa that the census is largely  the outcome of malicious jealousy. It is usual that after the census the  editor of the Mariposa Newspacket makes a careful reestimate (based  on the data of relative non-payment of subscriptions), and brings the  population up to 6,000. After that the Mariposa Times-Herald makes  an estimate that runs the figures up to 6,500. Then Mr. Gingham,  the undertaker, who collects the vital statistics for the provincial  government, makes an estimate from the number of what he calls the  \"demised\" as compared with the less interesting persons who are still  alive, and brings the population to 7,000. After that somebody else  works it out that it's 7,500; then the man behind the bar of the  Mariposa House offers to bet the whole room that there are 9,000 people  in Mariposa. That settles it, and the population is well on the way to  10,000, when down swoops the federal census taker on his next round and  the town has to begin all over again.    Still, it is a thriving town and there is no doubt of it. Even the  transcontinental railways, as any townsman will tell you, run through  Mariposa. It is true that the trains mostly go through at night and  don't stop. But in the wakeful silence of the summer night you may hear  the long whistle of the through train for the west as it tears through  Mariposa, rattling over the switches and past the semaphores and  ending in a long, sullen roar as it takes the trestle bridge over the  Ossawippi. Or, better still, on a winter evening about eight o'clock you  will see the long row of the Pullmans and diners of the night express  going north to the mining country, the windows flashing with brilliant  light, and within them a vista of cut glass and snow-white table linen,  smiling negroes and millionaires with napkins at their chins whirling  past in the driving snowstorm.    I can tell you the people of Mariposa are proud of the trains, even if  they don't stop! The joy of being on the main line lifts the Mariposa  people above the level of their neighbours in such places as Tecumseh  and Nichols Corners into the cosmopolitan atmosphere of through traffic  and the larger life. Of course, they have their own train, too--the  Mariposa Local, made up right there in the station yard, and running  south to the city a hundred miles away. That, of course, is a real  train, with a box stove on end in the passenger car, fed with cordwood  upside down, and with seventeen flat cars of pine lumber set between the  passenger car and the locomotive so as to give the train its full impact  when shunting.    Outside of Mariposa there are farms that begin well but get thinner and  meaner as you go on, and end sooner or later in bush and swamp and the  rock of the north country. And beyond that again, as the background of  it all, though it's far away, you are somehow aware of the great pine  woods of the lumber country reaching endlessly into the north.    Not that the little town is always gay or always bright in the sunshine.  There never was such a place for changing its character with the season.  Dark enough and dull it seems of a winter night, the wooden sidewalks  creaking with the frost, and the lights burning dim behind the shop  windows. In olden times the lights were coal oil lamps; now, of course,  they are, or are supposed to be, electricity, brought from the power  house on the lower Ossawippi nineteen miles away. But, somehow, though  it starts off as electricity from the Ossawippi rapids, by the time it  gets to Mariposa and filters into the little bulbs behind the frosty  windows of the shops, it has turned into coal oil again, as yellow and  bleared as ever.    After the winter, the snow melts and the ice goes out of the lake, the  sun shines high and the shanty-men come down from the lumber woods and  lie round drunk on the sidewalk outside of Smith's Hotel--and that's  spring time. Mariposa is then a fierce, dangerous lumber town,  calculated to terrorize the soul of a newcomer who does not  understand that this also is only an appearance and that presently the  rough-looking shanty-men will change their clothes and turn back again  into farmers.    Then the sun shines warmer and the maple trees come out and Lawyer  Macartney puts on his tennis trousers, and that's summer time. The  little town changes to a sort of summer resort. There are visitors up  from the city. Every one of the seven cottages along the lake is full.  The Mariposa Belle churns the waters of the Wissanotti into foam as she  sails out from the wharf, in a cloud of flags, the band playing and the  daughters and sisters of the Knights of Pythias dancing gaily on the  deck.    That changes too. The days shorten. The visitors disappear. The golden  rod beside "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C.
