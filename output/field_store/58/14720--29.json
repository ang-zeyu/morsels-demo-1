Many have suffered martyrdom  for literary and also religious improvements, to whom after ages have  done better justice. \"Which of the prophets have not your fathers  persecuted, and slain them which told before of the coming of the Just  One?\"    It was the misfortune of many of the former prophets, that they were  raised up at a period of the world when apostacy and corruption  rendered their efforts indispensable, although such efforts proved  unacceptable to those who were in fault. Ancient prophets, you know,  did not merely reiterate what their predecessors had taught, but  spoke hidden wisdom, even things that had been kept secret for many  generations; because the spirit by which they were moved had knowledge  of all truth, and could disclose and reveal as it seemed wisdom in God.    The spirits that were disobedient, while once the long-suffering of God  waited in the days of Noah, doubtless despised the prophet that taught  a universal deluge. But Noah had a special revelation of a deluge,  although the religious people of his day counted him an enthusiast. The  revelation given to Moses to _gather_ an opprest people to a particular  place, was equally one side of, and out of the usual course of former  revelations. John came to the literal followers of Abraham and Moses;  but he escaped not persecution and death, because he breathed an  uncharitable and exclusive spirit towards the existing sects of the  day. Still he was a revelator and seer approved of God.    And is it a thing incredible with you, brother, that before the great  sabbatic era, world's rest, or millennium, God should raise up a  prophet to prepare the people for that event, and the second coming of  Jesus Christ? Would it be disagreeable to those who love the unity  of Saints, or improbable or unscriptural to expect such a prophet to  be possessed with the key of knowledge, or endowed, like Peter, with  the _stone_ of revelation? If the many hundred religious sects of this  age should hereafter harmonize into one faith and brotherhood, without  the aid of special revelations, it would constitute an unparalleled  phenomenon. Should they become a bride fit to receive Jesus Christ  at his coming, it could not be according to Paul's gospel. For six  thousand years, apostles and prophets have constituted an essential  part of the spiritual edifice in which God dwells. Paul says it is by  them the church is perfected and brought to unity of faith.    I know that you and I have been taught from our childhood, that the  church can be perfected without prophets; but where, I ask, is the  first scripture to support this view?    As you kindly say, I have always been accustomed to offer a reason for  my faith; but be assured I was confounded and made dumb, when asked  why I taught another gospel than what Paul did--why I taught that  revelation was ended, when Paul did not--or why I taught that prophets  were not needed, when no inspired teacher ever taught such a doctrine.  Error may become venerable by age, and respectable from the number of  its votaries, but neither age nor popularity can ever make it truth.    You give me credit for a conscientious regard for the will of God.  It was _this_ that gave me the victory where many others, I fear,  are vanquished. The spirit of God wrought mightily in me, commending  the ancient gospel to my conscience. I contemplated it with peaceful  serenity and joy in believing. Visions and dreams began to illuminate,  occasionally, my slumbering moments; but when I allowed my selfish  propensities to speak, I cursed Mormonism in my heart, and regretted  being in possession of as much light and knowledge as had flowed into  my mind from that source. When I preached or conversed according to  my best convictions, peace reigned in my heart, and truth enlarged  my understanding. Conviction and reverence for the truth, at such  times seemed to reign in the hearts of those that heard me; at times,  however, some were ready to gnash their teeth, for the truth that they  would not receive and could not resist.    I counted the cost, to myself and family, of embracing such views,  until I could read it like the child his alphabet, either upward or  downward. The expense I viewed through unavoidable tears, both in  public and private, by night and by day; I said, however, the Lord He  is God, I _can_, I _will_ embrace the truth.    When I considered the weakness of the human mind, and its liability  to be deceived, I re-examined and held converse with the most able  opposers to Mormonism, in a meek and teachable spirit; but the ease  with which many, wearing a high profession of piety, turned aside  the force of palpable truth, or leaned on tradition or inextricable  difficulties, that they could not solve into harmony with their  professions, was very far from dissuading me from my new views. What  could I do? Truth had taken possession of my mind--plain, simple, Bible  truth. It might be asked if I could not expel it from my door; yes, I  _could_ do it; but how would that harmonize with a sincere profession  to preach and practice the truth, by way of example to others? It was  a crisis I never shall--I never can forget. I remember it as an exodus  from parents, kindred, denomination, and temporal support. Has any  one ever passed such a crisis, they will say, at least, be careful of  Brother Spencer's character and feelings.    Little as I supposed that I cared about popularity, competence, or  the fellowship of those who were sincerely in error, when I came to  be stretched upon the altar of sacrifice, and the unsheathed blade  that was to exscind from all these hung over me with perpendicular  exactness; then, then, brother, I cried unto the Lord to strengthen me  to pass through the scene with his approbation.    While I was inquiring to know what the Lord would have me to do, many  brethren of different denominations warned and exhorted me faithfully;  but their warnings consisted very much in a lively exhibition of evils  to be endured, if I persisted; or, in other words, they appealed to my  selfish nature. But I knew too well that truth should not be abandoned  through the force of such appeals, however eloquently urged. Some  with whom I conversed, gave glowing descriptions of the obnoxious  character of Joseph Smith, and of the contradictory and unscriptural  jargon of the Book of Mormon, but it was their misfortune usually to be  deplorably ignorant of the true character of either.    Of the truth of this statement many instances might be furnished, if  the limits of my sheet would allow. My own solicitude to know the  character of Mr. Smith, in order to judge of the doctrines propagated  by him, was not so great as that of some others. My aversion to the  worship of man, is both educational and religious; but I said boldly,  concerning Mr. Smith, that whoever had arranged and harmonized such  a system of irresistible truth, has borne good fruit. Some suggested  that it would be wisdom to make a personal acquaintance with Mr.  Smith, previous to embracing his doctrines; but to me the obligation  to receive the truths of heaven seemed absolute, whatever might be the  character of Mr. Smith.    I read diligently the Book of Mormon from beginning to end, in close  connexion with the comments of Origen Bachelor, Laroy Sunderland,  and Dr. Hulburt, together with newspapers and some private letters  obtained from the surviving friends of Mr. Spaulding, the supposed  author of that book. I arose from its perusal with a strong conviction  on my mind, that its pages were graced with the pen of inspiration. I  was surprised that so little fault could be found with a book of such  magnitude, treating, as it did, of such diversified subjects, through  a period of so many generations. It appeared to me, that no enemy to  truth or godliness would ever take the least interest in publishing the  contents of such a book; such appeared to me to be its godly bearing,  sound morality, and harmony with ancient scriptures, that the enemy of  all righteousness might as well proclaim the dissolution of his own  kingdom, as to spread the contents of such a volume among men; and  from that time to this, every effort made by its enemies to demolish,  has only shown how invincible a fortress defends it. If no greater  breach can be made upon it, than has hitherto been made by those  who have attacked it with the greatest animosity and diligence, its  overthrow may be considered a forlorn hope. On this subject I only ask  the friends of pure religion to read the Book of Mormon with the same  unprejudiced, prayerful, and teachable spirit that they would recommend  unbelievers in the ancient scriptures to read those sacred records. I  have not spoken of the external evidence of the truth of the Book of  Mormon, which is now worthy of much consideration; but the internal  evidence, I think, will satisfy every honest mind. As you enquire after  the reasons that operated to change my mind to the present faith, I  only remark that \"Steven's Travels\" had some influence, as an external  evidence of the truth of the Book of Mormon.    My present view, after which you also enquire, is, that the evidence,  both internal and external, have been multiplied. It may have caused  surprise and wonder to many of my respected and distinguished friends  in New England, how I could ever renounce a respectable standing in the  churches and in the ministry, to adhere to a people so odious in every  one's mouth, and so revolting to every one's natural liking; the answer  in part is this:--As soon as I discovered an identity in the doctrines  of the Latter-day Saints and the Ancient Saints, I enquired whether  the treatment bestowed upon each was also similar. I immediately  began to dig deep to find the foundation and corner-stone of the  true church; I looked at the demeanour and character of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#2)"],[1,"attributes the building. The church of  _La Pieve_ is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.  Its four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been  finished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;  the west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor  its defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which  nothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at  Lucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column  capitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its  lowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.  The arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so  they are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium  shows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The  arches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well  as those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of  prodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is  quite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;  the arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The  south side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:  but it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient  building on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the  west front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished  from Arezzo. The \"Tyrrhena regum progenies\" have here left but small  traces behind them.          Cortona.      From Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height         ... Cortona lifts to heaven         Her diadem of towers.    If the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the  walls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,  suggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their  race, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not  win victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer  seems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with  Clitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The  journey is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we  might well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione  Fiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern  hill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers  a hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione  distinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height  which it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.  We have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the  height, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and  Corinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of  the younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,  as at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has  never come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has  become at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas  is forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of  the ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a  city like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \"diadem  of towers\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of  towers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any  account in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make  up an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,  there is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well  forsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the  plain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city  itself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it  that we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site  itself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world  that there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main  interest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased  that everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and  that the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the  Etruscan walls.    In truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that  Cortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had  found only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which  later times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost  among the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been  great in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little  account that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the  ground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just  at that time came its short period of anything like importance among  the cities of mediaeval Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth  century, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.  Yet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though  we can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a  city, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the  younger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional  visitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;  another persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the  ancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona  is emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own  company.    As an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,  through the regular stages of Roman colony and mediaeval commonwealth,  Cortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of  its being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing  that can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and  monasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some  contain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps  marks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that  its cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.  The _duomo_ stands about half-way up the height within the town, on  a corner of the walls. Its elegant _Renaissance_ interior has been  already spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building  the columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper  city where we should have looked for the _duomo_ is occupied by the  Church of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over  her portal as \"poenitens Margarita,\" marked off thereby alike from  the virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal  buildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio  must be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly  coated as it is with the arms of successive _podestas_. Of private  palaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not  on its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.  From the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the  acropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.  The Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins--not an  usual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its  ditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed  fabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which  the visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local  importunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points  of view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done  first of all--that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing  that makes Cortona what it is.    The process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in  some measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.  Happily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in  by far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan  rampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no  small height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,  but still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood  in the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is  reason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must  remember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the  days of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman  works. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the  one remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might  almost have stood at Mykene. On the highest point, the hindermost  point, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside  an inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,  the Etruscan wall has largely given way to the mediaeval fortress whose  present aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only  to leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an  outpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of  the whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seeming  to stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the  history of Cortona in stone and brick.    From the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and  the other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,  the glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chimaera is the glory  of the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought  with endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a  female head, "]]]
