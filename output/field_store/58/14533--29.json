[Illustration: LUNATIC ASYLUM, BLACKWELL'S ISLAND.]          ADVENTURES AND OBSERVATIONS IN NICARAGUA.      We have already announced in these pages that Mr. SQUIER, who was lately  representative of the United States in Nicaragua, had in preparation for  the press an account of his residence in that interesting country, and  expressed an opinion that his work would surpass in interest and value  the entire library of English and French publications on the subject. An  examination of some of the sheets justifies our expectations; Mr. Squier  must hereafter be ranked among the most successful travel-writers as  well as antiquaries of the time; he knows what to observe and how to  observe, and his relations with the Nicaraguans were such that no  traveller had ever better opportunities for the acquisition of facts or  the formation of judgments. His work will soon be published in a  profusely illustrated octavo by Mr. Putnam. A pleasant specimen of the  author's style is afforded by the following sketch of an evening ride on  the banks of the lake of Granada, and of the signoras of that  metropolis.    \"After a pleasant interview of half an hour we bade Don Jose \"_buena  tarde_,\" and galloped down to the shores of the lake, just as the sun  was setting, throwing the whole beach in the shade, while the fairy  \"Corales\" were swimming in the evening light. The shore was ten-fold  more animated than when we landed the day previously; men on horseback,  women on foot, sailors, fishermen, idlers, children, and a swarm of  water-carriers, mingling together, gave life to the scene; while boats  and graceful canoes drawn up on the beach, barges rocking at their  anchors outside, the grim old fort frowning above, and the green border  of trees, with bars of sunlight streaming between them, all contributed  to heighten and give effect to the picture. We rode up the glacis of the  old castle, through its broken archway, into its elevated area, and  looked out beyond the broad and beautiful lake, upon the distant shores  of Chontales, with its earthquake-river, hills, and rugged volcanic  craters. Their rough features were brought out sharply and distinctly in  the slanting light which gilded the western slope of the gigantic  volcano of Momobacho, while its eastern declivity slept in purple  shadow. We were absorbed in contemplating, one by one, these varied  beauties, when the bells of the city struck the hour of the \"oracion.\"  In an instant every voice was hushed, the horseman reined in his steed,  the rope dropped from the hands of the sailor, the sentinel on the fort  stopped short in his round; even the water-jar was left half filled,  every head was uncovered, and every lip moved in prayer. The merry waves  seemed to break more gently on the shore in harmony with the vibrations  of the distant bells, while the subdued hum of reverential voices filled  the pauses between. There was something almost magical in this sudden  hush of the multitude, and its apparent entire absorption in its  devotions, which could not fail deeply to impress the stranger  witnessing it for the first time.    \"No sooner, however, had the bells ceased to toll and struck up the  concluding joyful chime, than the crowd on the shore resumed its life  and gayety, while we put spurs to our horses and darted through their  midst on our return to the city. The commandant and his companions would  only leave me at my door, where we were saluted by our host with, \"Saved  your distance, gentlemen, dinner's ready!\"    \"An evening visit to the Senorita Teresa, finished our first entire day  in Granada. This young lady had been educated in the United States,  spoke English very well, and was withal a proficient in  music--accomplishments which we never before learned to estimate at  their true value. It was worth something to hear well executed passages  from familiar operas, amidst tangible and not painted orange trees and  palms, and in an atmosphere really loaded with tropical perfumes,  instead of the odors of oil-pots and gas lights. Eight o'clock was the  signal for general withdrawal from the streets, for then commenced the  reign of the military police, and the city became at once still and  quiet. The occasional barking of a dog, the tinkling of a distant  guitar, the soughing of the evening wind amongst the trees of the  courtyard, the measured tread and graduated \"alertas!\" of the sentinels,  were the only interruptions to the almost sepulchral silence. While  returning to our quarters we were startled by the \"Quien vive?\" of the  sentinel, uttered in a tone absolutely ferocious, and as these fellows  rarely parleyed long, we answered with all expedition, \"La Patria,\"  which was followed on the instant by \"Que gente?\" \"Americanos del  Norte.\" This was enough--these we found were magic words which opened  every heart and every door in all Nicaragua. They never failed us. We  felt proud to know that no such charm was attached to \"Ingleses,\"  \"Alemanes\", or \"Franceses.\"    \"The day following, in accordance with the \"costumbres del pais,\" the  customs of the country, we returned the visits of the preceding day, and  began to see more of the domestic and social life of the citizens of  Granada. We found all of the residences comfortable, and many elegant,  governed by mistresses simple, but graceful and confiding in their  manners. They were frank in their conversation and inquired with the  utmost _naivete_ whether I was married or intended to be, and if the  ladies of El Norte would probably visit Granada, when the \"Vapores  grandes,\" the great steamers came to run to San Juan, and the  \"Vaporcitas\" steameretts, to ply on the lake and river. They had heard  of a Mr. Estevens (their nearest approach to Stephens), who had written  a book about their \"pobre pais,\" their poor country, and were anxious to  know what he had said of them, and whether our people really regarded  them as \"esclavos y brutes sin verguenza,\" slaves and brutes without  shame, as the abominable English (los malditos Ingleses) had represented  them. They were also very anxious to know whether the party of  Californians which had passed through, were \"gente commun,\" common  people, or \"caballeros,\" gentlemen, upon which point, however, we were  diplomatically evasive, for there was more in the inquiry than we chose  to notice. Our lady had heard that I was a great antiquarian, and,  anticipatory to my visit, had got together a most incongruous collection  of curiosities, from \"vasos antiguos,\" fragments of pottery, and stone  hatchets, down to an extraordinary pair of horn spectacles and a  preposterously distorted hog's hoof,--all of which she insisted on  sending to my quarters, which she did, with some rare birds, and a  plate of dulces! At every house we found a table spread with wines and  sweetmeats, and bearing a silver brazier filled with burning coals, for  the greater convenience of lighting cigars. I excited much surprise by  declining to smoke, on the ground that I had never done so; but the  ladies insisted on my taking a \"cigarita,\" which they said wouldn't  injure a new-born babe, and paid me the compliment of lighting it with  their own fair lips, after which it would have been rank treason to  etiquette, and would have ruined my reputation for gallantry, had I  refused. I at first endeavored to shirk the responsibility of smoking by  thrusting them into my vest pocket, but found that as soon as one  disappeared, another was presented, so I was obliged \"to face the music\"  in the end. In every sala we found a large hammock suspended from the  walls, which was invariably tendered to the visitor, even when there  were easy chairs and sofas in the room. This is the seat of honor.    [Illustration: RESIDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, SAN  JUAN DE NICARAGUA.]    \"The women of pure Spanish stock are very fair, and have the  _embonpoint_ which characterizes the sex under the tropics. Their dress,  except in a few instances where the stiff costume of our own country had  been adopted, was exceedingly loose and flowing, leaving the neck and  arms exposed. The entire dress was often pure white, but generally the  skirt, or _nagua_, was of some flowered stuff, in which case the  _guipil_ (_anglice_ vandyke) was white, heavily trimmed with lace. Satin  slippers, a red or purple sash wound loosely round the waist, and a  rosary sustaining a little golden cross, with a narrow golden band, or a  string of pearls extending around the forehead and binding the hair,  which often fell in luxuriant waves upon their shoulders, completed a  costume as novel as it was graceful and picturesque. To all this add the  superior attractions of an oval face, regular features, large and  lustrous black eyes, small mouth, pearly white teeth, and tiny hands and  feet, and withal a low but clear voice, and the reader has a picture of  a Central American lady of pure stock. A large number of the women have,  however, an infusion of other families and races, from the Saracen to  the Indian and the Negro, in every degree of intermixture. And as tastes  differ, so may opinions as to whether the tinge of brown, through which  the blood glows with a peach-like bloom, in the complexion of the girl  who may trace her lineage to the Caziques upon one side, and the haughty  grandees of Andalusia and Seville on the other, superadded, as it  usually is, to a greater lightness of figure and animation of  face,--whether this is not a more real beauty than that of the fair and  more languid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33966"],[0,"Occurrence of the Garter Snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, in the Great Plains and (#2)"],[1," some drainage basins.    Convincing records of _sirtalis_ are lacking from all of  Colorado--except for those in the drainage basins of the South Platte,  and the Rio Grande east of the Continental Divide--from the eastern  half of Utah (east of the Wasatch Range), from New Mexico except for  the Rio Grande drainage (with one record each for the Canadian and  Pecos river drainages), from southwestern Wyoming (at least that  part in the Colorado River drainage basin), from the western half of  Oklahoma, and from Texas, except the eastern and extreme western and  northern parts. The species occurs in Nevada only near that state's  western and northern boundaries. The range is therefore much different  than it has been depicted heretofore, with the populations living east  of the Continental Divide widely separated from those to the west  for the entire length of the Rocky Mountains south of the Yellowstone  National Park region. The populations of northern Utah, southern  Idaho, and Nevada, which have been considered _parietalis_ are thus  far removed from the main population of that subspecies to the east  and are isolated from them by the barrier of the Continental Divide  and arid regions farther west.    Although some of the records published for _Thamnophis sirtalis_ are  erroneous, being based on misidentifications of other species, various  outlying records, including those in western Kansas, the Panhandle of  Texas, and southeastern New Mexico probably represent localized relict  populations that have survived from a time when the species was more  generally distributed in this region. The population of _T. sirtalis_  in the Rio Grande drainage of New Mexico is geographically isolated  and remote from other populations of the species. Except for a few  isolated and highly localized populations the species is absent from  the Republican, Smoky Hill, Arkansas, Cimarron, Canadian, Red, Brazos,  Colorado and Pecos rivers and their tributaries west of the one  hundredth meridian in the arid High Plains.    Streams in this region of High Plains are in most instances unsuitable  habitats because they are in eroded channels, have a variable  and uncertain water supply, and have poorly developed riparian  communities. The marsh and wet meadow habitat preferred by _sirtalis_  in most parts of its range is almost absent. _T. radix_ and _T.  marcianus_, well adapted to conditions in this region, perhaps provide  competition that is limiting to _T. sirtalis_. However, several  well-isolated populations of _sirtalis_ have survived as relicts in  the southern Great Plains, presumably from a time several thousand  years ago when mesic conditions were more prevalent, perhaps in an  early postglacial stage.           *       *       *       *       *    Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of a part of the United States in  the region of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, and adjacent  northwestern Mexico showing supposed range (shaded) and localities of  authenticated occurrence (dots) of _Thamnophis sirtalis_. 1. _T.  s. fitchi_, 2. _T. s. parietalis_, 3. _T. s. annectens_, 4. _T. s.  ornata_. Records from Idaho and Wyoming are based on specimens in  the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History collection. Other  records are based on Woodbury (1931) for Utah, Hudson (1942) for  Nebraska, Maslin (1959) for Colorado, Smith (1956) for Kansas, R. G.  Webb (MS) for Oklahoma, Brown (1950) and Fouquette and Lindsay (1955)  for Texas, Cope (1900), Van Denburgh (1924), Little and Keller (1937)  for New Mexico, and Smith and Taylor (1945) for Mexico.           *       *       *       *       *    Smith (1956:292) recorded _parietalis_ from three outlying stations  in the western quarter of Kansas, from Wallace, Hamilton and Meade  counties in the drainages of the Smoky Hill River, Arkansas River, and  Cimarron River, respectively. Permanent springs in Meade County State  Park perhaps account for the survival of an isolated colony there.  Several specimens from that locality seen by Fitch in August, 1960,  when recently collected by a University of Michigan field party,  seemed to be of the Texas subspecies _annectens_, as their dorsal  stripes were reddish orange, and markings on the dorsolateral area  were pale yellow rather than red. Specimens from the Texas Panhandle,  from Hemphill County (Brown, 1950:207) and nine miles east of Stinnet,  Hutchison County (Fouquette and Lindsay, 1955:417) likewise are most  nearly like _annectens_ judging from the authors' descriptions. The  specimens from nine miles east of Stinnet averaged large; the two  largest would have attained or slightly exceeded four feet in length  if they had had complete tails. No _sirtalis_ so long as four feet has  been recorded elsewhere.    Records are lacking from the drainages of the Republican, North  Canadian, Brazos and Colorado River drainages in the High Plains, but  possibly isolated populations occur in some of these also. The only  record from the Pecos River drainage is that of Bundy (1951:314) from  Wade's Swamp near Artesia, Eddy County, New Mexico. This locality  is separated by some 140 miles from any other known station of  occurrence.    From extreme southern Colorado south across New Mexico to the Mexican  border _T. sirtalis_ occurs in continuous or nearly continuous  populations in the Rio Grande Valley, and has been recorded from many  localities. It has been recorded from relatively few localities of  tributary streams (Los Pinos, Abiqui, Santa Fe) all near the main  valley. There is one record from the Ocate River, a headwaters  tributary of the Canadian River, in the Sangre de Cristo  Mountains near other localities in the Rio Grande drainage. The  southwestern-most known locality of occurrence is Casas Grandes in the  Mexican state of Chihuahua some 130 miles southwest of El Paso, Texas,  and near the Continental Divide. The Rio Casas Grandes must have once  been a tributary of the Rio Grande, but now its desert drainage basin  is isolated.      RE-DESCRIPTION OF A SUBSPECIES FROM NEW MEXICO    Most specimens of a population of _sirtalis_ occurring in New Mexico  are recognizably different from most specimens of other populations.  This New Mexican population is therefore here recognized as a distinct  subspecies:    THAMNOPHIS SIRTALIS ORNATA Baird      _Eutaenia ornata_ Baird, 1859:16.    _Eutaenia sirtalis dorsalis_ Cope, 1900:1076.    _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_ (part) Van Denburgh, 1924:222.        _Type._--U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, obtained at El Paso, Texas,      at some time in the eighteen fifties by Col. J. D. Graham.        _Range._--Rio Grande and vicinity, from Conejos and Costilla      counties in extreme south-central Colorado south across New      Mexico to Mexican border. Records from neighboring drainage      systems, Casas Grandes in Chihuahua and Artesia and Ocate      River in New Mexico, probably also pertain to _ornata_.        _Description._--A specimen in the University of New Mexico      Natural History Museum (E. D. Flaherty No. 560, obtained      one mile west and one-half mile south of Isleta, Bernalillo      County, New Mexico, on May 31, 1959) was described as      follows while its colors were still but little altered by      preservatives: Top of head olive, supralabials pale gray,      edged with black posteriorly; chin milky white, with dark      edges posteriorly on fifth, sixth and seventh infralabials;      dorsal stripe yellow; including middorsal row of scales and      little more than adjacent half of row on either side of it;      dorsolateral area olive-brown with row of black spots on its      lower half, these spots elliptical, averaging about size      of one scale on anterior part of body, smaller posteriorly;      adjacent spots separated by interspaces of approximately      their own length, irregular black markings on upper half      of dorsolateral area not forming definite spots but fused      longitudinally to form continuous black border to dorsal      stripe; crescent-shaped red markings in areas between scale      rows three to nine, these markings invading edges of scales,      and themselves having ill-defined edges blending into the      darker ground color; lateral stripe pale, yellowish gray,      limited to scale rows two and three for most of its length,      but including rows four and five in neck region; row of      irregular black marks low on each side, with each mark      centering on anterior part of lower half of scale of first      row but overlapping onto corners of adjacent ventrals;      approximately every other scale of first row so marked;      ventral surface pale, suffused with bluish tint; most of      ventrals marked on anterior edges with pair of semicircular      black spots, each situated about two-thirds of distance from      mid-line to lateral edge of ventral; these marks diminishing      in size and finally disappearing on posterior part of body;      ventral surface otherwise immaculate.        Lepidosis normal for genus and species, with preoculars single      on each side, supralabials 7-7, infralabials 8-8, ventrals      159, anal entire, subcaudals 77 (including terminal spine),      paired except for second, third and fourth; scale rows 19      from neck slightly beyond mid-body, fifth on left side ending      opposite 86th ventral; length from snout to vent 670 mm., tail      202 mm.        _Comparisons._--From _T. s. parietalis_, _T. s. ornata_      differs in its consistently pale ground color, olive instead      of dark brown or black. In respect to color-pattern _ornata_      stands in approximately the same relation to _parietalis_ as,      farther west, _T. s. infernalis_, a pale subspecies of the      California coast, stands in relation to _T. s. fitchi_.      Nevertheless, _fitchi_ consistently has a dark ground color,      whereas _parietalis_ is highly variable, and the color of an      occasional specimen (for example KU"]]]
