The protracted ill-health of its noble possessor,  was the cause no doubt of the Banksian magnificent library being left  deficient in several of the latest continental works; and that of the  British Museum I have reason to think is still more defective. To the  honour however of the keepers of the Bodleian and Radcliffe Libraries, it  should be mentioned, that no pains or expense have been spared to render  them as perfect in this branch as possible; and we have been told that the  latter particularly is the most magnificent in the kingdom.    We shall now as briefly as possible advert to the contents of this volume.    In the Ornithological department the systems of Cuvier and Temminck have  mostly superseded all others: as a whole, we give a decided preference to  the latter, as being more natural, though it may be doubted if the generic  distinctions are not too few, while those of Cuvier are too many: both  however can be considered only as sketches, subject to improvement--as  natural affinities are more studied.    Regarding that part of our work which relates to Entomology, we have given  a decided preference to the Lepidoptera, for the simple reason that this  order has received less attention from all writers, concerning their real  characters and affinities, than any other; indeed they have been most  unaccountably neglected even by Latreille, the great founder of the modern  school: we have therefore thought it necessary to propose in this  department many new genera, and only have to regret that their definitions  could not be made more perfect without the destruction of the specimens,  frequently not our own, and which therefore was unattainable: a more  extended knowledge of the natural affinities existing in this tribe, will  alone confirm or annul the propriety of these distinctions.    In _Conchology_ many of the genera long established on the Continent, but  new to our own collectors, have been characterized and illustrated, as well  as specific distinctions defined between shells hitherto considered as  varieties; and here it must be observed that so much latitude has been  given to the meaning of the term _variety_, that in its general acceptation  its definition becomes impossible: our own idea of its true meaning is, a  shell possessing one or more characters which are changeable and uncertain,  and which consequently will not serve as indications by which it may  infallibly be distinguished from all others; _variety_ depends on local  circumstances, and affects the size, colour, and greater or less  development of the same modification of structure; a _species_ is  permanent, its structure always the same though more or less developed,  producing and perpetuating its kind, and depending on formation,  discernible in youth, and matured in age: we cannot therefore comprehend  the contradictory term of _permanent varieties_ in a state of nature  (though such occur in domesticated animals), which some authors have used,  and which has led to, in many instances, the most erroneous conclusions.    It is lamentable to see the opposition which is still made by our own  writers against all the modern improvements; yet although Linnaean  Introductions to Conchology are constantly issuing from the press, the  desire of being acquainted with a more natural and intelligible  classification has already appeared; and as we are frequently questioned on  the subject, we cannot in this place do better than refer the young student  to the valuable article on Conchology contained in the late supplement to  the _Encyclopedia Britannica_, the perusal of which will convey more solid  information, and less perplexity, than all the Introductions our  booksellers can boast of.    With respect to the quotations or synonyms, it should be observed that we  have in most instances limited them only to original works, all doubtful  ones have been rejected, and such only given as have been actually  consulted; indeed to this latter cause must be attributed the occasional  omission of some, existing in books we had not the immediate power of  consulting; our own library is not small; but the difficulty and expense of  procuring all the new continental publications, and the impossibility of  meeting with them at our public libraries[2], may have sometimes led us  into error, and unintentionally to have passed over the discoveries of  others.    With the few additions contained in the Appendix we shall now conclude;  trusting that in the remarks drawn from us by the present state of the  science in this country, our zeal for truth will not give us an appearance  of want of candour or of vanity. The truth of our remarks on the labours of  others, every one at all acquainted with the subject can inquire into, and  either acknowledge or disprove: we neither deprecate nor despise criticism:  an author who presumes to instruct others, should have his pretensions  publicly canvassed, his merits admitted, or his deficiency exposed; no one  is more sensible than we are that our own pretensions chiefly consist in  having set an example for others more able to follow: and if we have in any  way advocated the cause of truth and science, our object will be attained,  and we shall then gladly retire in the shade.

It is a native of the Indian seas.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 71    [Illustration]    STROMBUS mutabilis,    _Little pink-mouthed Strombus._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 10.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _S. anfractu basali nodoso; spira brevi tantum non laevi; linea sulcata      suturae parallela; labio exteriore supra gibbo, margine recto,      interiore crasso, cum exteriore striato; apertura pallide rubicunda,      basi truncata._        Basal whirl nodulous; spire short, nearly smooth, with a sulcated line      parallel with the suture; outer lip above gibbous, the margin straight;      inner lip thick, both striated; aperture flesh colour; base truncated.        _Seba_, _tab._ 61. _fig._ 26 & 27, 32 & 33, 54. _tab._ 62. _fig._ 42 &      43? _Martini_ 3. _tab._ 77, 799. _fig._ 78, 807. _Knorr._ 2, 14. _fig._      3. _Rump._ 37.

It is not an uncommon shell  from the East Indies, and seldom grows larger than the figure.           *       *       *       *       *    STROMBUS dilatatus,    _Winged Strombus--middle figures._           *       *       *       *       *    _S. testa transverse striata; spira mediocri, plicis numerosis gracilibus;  labio exteriore dilatato, rotundato, crassissimo, reflexo; interiore supra  crassescente, medio laevi; apertura striata._    Shell transversely striated; spire moderate, with slender numerous plaits;  outer lip dilated, rounded, very thick, and reflected; inner lip thickened  above, smooth in the middle; aperture striated.           *       *       *       *       *    An undescribed species, and of the greatest rarity, for I have never seen  any other specimen, than one in my own cabinet, although perfect in form,  it is obviously faded in colour; yet it is too remarkable to be mistaken  for any other of this interesting family, which requires so much  illustration.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 72    [Illustration]    POGONIAS hirsutus,    _Hairy-breasted Toothbill._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 68.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. supra fuscus, maculis sulphureis, subtus sulphureus maculis nigris      interstinctus, capite juguloque nigris; pectoris plumis elongatis,      pilis setaceis terminatis._        Above brown, spotted with sulphur; beneath sulphureous, with black      spots; head and chin black; feathers of the breast lengthened, and      ending in long setaceous hairs.           *       *       *       *       *    I have before observed, that this genus of birds was first characterized  under the name of _Pogonias_, by Illiger, in 1811; some years after (1815),  M. Vieillot changed the name to _Pogonia_, without taking any notice of  Illiger's denomination, and Dr. Leach has followed Vieillot without  probably being aware of the plagiarism; Vieillot's name must, however, be  expunged, as Mr. Brown has some time back affixed the name of _Pogonia_ to  a remarkable genus of plants.    Total length about seven inches; bill blueish black, one inch two lines  long, and large in proportion; the tooth in the middle very prominent;  behind the eye is a short white stripe, and another much longer begins from  the under mandible, and goes half way down the neck; the chin and part of  the throat, together with the head and neck above, deep black, which  changes to a dark brown on the back, wings, covers, and tail; a small round  sulphur spot is on the tip of each feather of the hind head, back, and  lesser wing covers; the quills pale brown, margined with sulphur; the under  plumage is greenish sulphur, closely spotted with blackish; the most  extraordinary peculiarity of this bird consists in the feathers of the  breast, which are more rigid than the others, pointed, and the shaft of the  lower ones ending in fine incurved setaceous hairs, many of which are near  an inch long. The probable use this particular formation is intended for,  it is impossible to conjecture.    Mr. B. Leadbeater, to whom I am often obliged for the inspection of rare  subjects, received this from Africa, and it is the only individual of the  species I ever heard of.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 73    [Illustration]    PSITTACUS pulchellus,    _Turcosine Parrakeet._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. macrourus, supra viridis, subtus fulvus; sincipite, genis,      tegminibusque cyaneis, remigibus caeruleis; rectricibus lateralibus      fulvis._        Long-tailed Parrakeet, green above; yellow beneath; forepart of the      head, cheeks, and wing covers light blue; quills deep blue; lateral      tail feathers yellow.        _Shaw, Naturalist's Misc._ 3. _pl._ 96. _Latham, Suppl._ 2. _p._ 88.      _no._ 14.        _La Perruche Edwards, Le Vaillant_, _pl._ 68.

The only  representation of the male is in the Naturalist's Miscellany, where it  cannot be recognized, and Le Vaillant's is of the female, which differs  considerably from the other sex. It is a rare species, and peculiar to New  Holland.    Length nine inches, with the tail, which is near four inches and a half;  the upper part of the plumage olive green, not so bright as is usual in  this tribe; the front of the head is a most brilliant turcosine blue, which  spreads on the cheeks, nearly to the ears, and then mixes with the green;  the shoulders and lesser wing covers of the same colour, graduating to a  deep mazarine blue on the greater covers, spurious wings, and quill  feathers, which latter are all deep black beneath, as well as on their  interior shafts; at the base of the shoulders is a large irregular patch of  dull red, partially hid by the scapulars; the under plumage is yellow,  tinged with olive on the throat and breast, and verging towards orange on  the belly; tail feathers narrow and pointed, mostly green, with the inner  shafts blueish, and margined with black; the three outer on each side  nearly yellow, the next tipt only with that colour; under the wings  brilliant blue, the greater covers and quills deep black; bill very small;  upper mandible without a notch, and blackish; lower very convex, and, with  the legs, flesh colour.    The female figured by Le Vaillant is much less brilliant in all its  colours, and without the red mark on the shoulders.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 74    [Illustration]    ACHATINA fasciata,    _Chesnut-banded Achatina._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A. testa alba fasciis latis lineisque castaneis ornata; spira      elongata, crassescente; labio interiore semi-circulari, intus depresso;      columella truncata, emarginata._        Shell white, with broad chesnut bands and lines; spire elongated,      thickened; inner lip semi-circular, depressed within; columella      truncated, emarginate.

Gualtieri's figure at _tab._ 6. _fig._ D, is an admirable representation of  _A. pallida_, which, not having his work before me at the time, I could not  quote; the other at C is a very good one of the present shell. The upper  drawing is from one in my own cabinet; the lower is in the possession of  Mr. C. Dubois, who is continually adding to his fine and valuable  collection.
