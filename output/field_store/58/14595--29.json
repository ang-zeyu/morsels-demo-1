The earliest in the field of progress was the old-established firm of  Purdey and Co. Mr. Purdey, before the general introduction of  breechloaders, brought out an Express rifle, No. 70 bore, with a  mechanically fitting two-groove solid bullet. This small projectile was  a well-pointed cone weighing exactly 200 grains, with a powder charge of  110 grains, more than half the weight of the bullet. The extremely high  velocity of this rifle expanded the pure soft lead upon impact with the  skin and muscles of a red deer. At the same time there was no loss of  substance in the metal, as the bullet, although much disfigured,  remained intact, and continued its course of penetration, causing great  havoc by its increased surface. Nothing has surpassed this rifle in  velocity, although so many improvements have taken place since the  introduction of breechloaders, but in the days of muzzle-loaders it was  a satisfaction to myself that I was the first to commence the heavy  charge of powder with the 3 ounce bullet and 16 drams, to be followed  after many years by so high an authority as Mr. Purdey with a 200 grain  bullet and 110 grains of powder, thus verifying the principle of my  earliest experience.    This principle is now universally accepted, and charges of powder are  used, as a rule, which forty years ago would have been regarded as  impossible.    The modern breechloader in the hands of a well-trained soldier should be  a most deadly weapon, nevertheless we do not find a greater percentage  of destruction among the numbers engaged than resulted from the old  Brown Bess. The reason is obvious: battles are now fought at long  ranges, whereas in the early portion of the century fire was seldom  opened at a greater distance than 200 yards, and the actual struggle  terminated at close quarters.    A long-range rifle in the excitement of a hot action has several  disadvantages. The sights may have been set for 600 or 800 yards when  the enemy was at a distance, but should that interval be decreased by an  approach at speed, the sights would require an immediate readjustment,  otherwise the bullets would fly overhead, and the nearer the enemy  advanced, the safer he would be. Troops require most careful training  with the new weapons entrusted to their care. Although a rapidity of  fire if well directed must have a terrible result, there can be no  question that it engenders a wild excitement, and that a vast amount of  ammunition is uselessly expended, which, if reserved by slower but  steady shooting, would be far more deadly.    Although the difficulty is great in preventing troops from independent  firing when their blood is up in the heat of combat, the paramount duty  of an officer should be to control all wildness, and to insist upon  volleys in sections of companies by word of command, the sights of the  rifles being carefully adjusted, and a steady aim being taken at the  knees of the enemy.    There cannot be a better example than the advice upon this subject given  by the renowned General Wolfe (who was subsequently killed at the siege of  Quebec) to the 20th Regiment, of which he was Colonel, when England was  hourly expecting an invasion by the French:--... \"There is no necessity  for firing very fast; ... a cool well-levelled fire with the pieces  carefully loaded is much more destructive than the quickest fire in  confusion.\"--At Canterbury, 17th December 1755.    This instruction should be sternly impressed upon the minds of all  soldiers, as it is the text upon which all admonitory addresses should  be founded. It must not be forgotten that General Wolfe's advice was  given to men armed with the old muzzle-loading Brown Bess (musket),  which at that time was provided with a lock of flint and steel.  Notwithstanding the slowness of fire necessitated by this antiquated  weapon, the General cautioned his men by the assurance, \"There is no  necessity for firing very fast,\" etc., etc.    The breechloader is valuable through the power which exists, especially  with repeating rifles, for pouring in an unremitting fire whenever the  opportunity may offer, but under ordinary circumstances the fire should  be reserved with the care suggested by the advice of General Wolfe.    Small-bores have become the fashion of the day, and for military  purposes they are decidedly the best, as a greater amount of ammunition  can be carried by the soldier, while at the same time the range and  trajectory of his weapon are improved. The new magazine rifle adopted by  the Government is only '303, but this exceedingly small diameter will  contain 70 grains of powder with a bullet of hard alloy weighing 216  grains.    For sporting purposes the small-bore has been universally adopted, but I  cannot help thinking that like many other fashions, it has been carried  beyond the rules of common sense.    When upon entering a gunmaker's shop the inexperienced purchaser is  perplexed by the array of rifles and guns, varying in their characters  almost as much as human beings, he should never listen to the advice of  the manufacturer until he has asked himself what he really requires.    There are many things to be considered before an order should be  positively given. What is the rifle wanted for? What is the personal  strength of the purchaser? In what portion of the world is he going to  shoot? Will he be on foot, or will he shoot from horseback or from an  elephant? Will the game be dangerous, or will it be confined to deer,  etc.?    Not only the weapon but the ammunition will depend upon a reply to these  questions, and the purchaser should strongly resist the delusion that  any one particular description will be perfect as a so-called general  rifle. You may as well expect one kind of horse or one pattern of ship  to combine all the requirements of locomotion as to suppose that a  particular rifle will suit every variety of game or condition of  locality.    In South Africa accuracy is necessary at extremely long ranges for the  open plains, where antelopes in vast herds are difficult of approach. In  Indian jungles the game is seldom seen beyond fifty or sixty yards. In  America the stalking among the mountains is similar to that of the  Scottish Highlands, but upon a larger scale. In Central Africa the  distances are as uncertain as the quality of the animals that may be  encountered.    Upon the level plains of India, where the blackbuck forms the main  object of pursuit, extreme accuracy and long range combined are  necessary, with a hollow Express bullet that will not pass through the  body. How is it possible that any one peculiar form of rifle can combine  all these requirements? Rifles must be specially adapted for the animals  against which they are to be directed. I have nothing to do with the  purse, but I confine my remarks to the weapons and the game, and I shall  avoid technical expressions.    The generally recognised small-bores, all of which are termed \"Express\"  from the large charge of powder, are as follow:--    Small-bore   Charge of       Large-   Charge of     For all Game  Express.     Powder.         bores.   Powder.       such as*    '577         6 1/2 drams     4 bore   14 drams      Elephants.  '500         5 1/2   \"       8  \"     14   \"        Rhinoceros.  '450         5       \"      10  \"     12   \"        Buffaloes.  '400         4       \"      12  \"     10   \"  '360    Toys.  '295    Toys.    The two latter rifles, '360 and '295, are charming additions, and  although capable of killing deer are only to be recommended as  companions for a stroll but not to be classed as sporting rifles for  ordinary game. They are marvellously accurate, and afford great  satisfaction for shooting small animals and birds. The '360 may be used  for shooting black-buck, but I should not recommend it if the hunter  possesses a '400.    It would be impossible to offer advice that would suit all persons.  I  can therefore only give a person opinion according to my own experience.    For all animals above the size of a fallow deer and below that of a  buffalo I prefer the '577 solid Express--648 grains solid bullet,--6  drams powder not 6 1/2, as the charge of only 6 drams produces greater  accuracy at long ranges.    The weight of this rifle should be 11 1/2 lbs., or not exceeding 12 lbs.  For smaller game, from fallow deer downwards, I prefer the '400 Express  with a charge of from 85 grains to 4 drams of powder--solid bullet,  excepting the case of black-buck, where, on account of numerous villages  on the plains, it is necessary that the bullet should not pass through  the body. The important question of weight is much in favour of the  '400, as great power and velocity are obtained by a weapon of only 8 1/2  lbs.    I should therefore limit my battery to one '577, one '400, and one  Paradox No. 12, for ordinary game in India, as elephants and other of  the larger animals require special outfit. The Paradox*, invented by  Colonel Fosberry and manufactured by Messrs. Holland and Holland of Bond  Street, is a most useful weapon, as it combines the shot-gun with a  rifle that is wonderfully accurate within a range of 100 yards. (* Since  this was written Messrs. Holland have succeeded after lengthened  experiments in producing a Paradox No. 8, which burns 10 drams of  powder, and carries a very heavy bullet with extreme accuracy. This will  be a new departure in weapons for heavy game.)    It is a smooth-bore slightly choked, but severely rifled for only 1 1/2  inch in length from the muzzle. This gives the spin to the projectile  sufficient to ensure accuracy at the distance mentioned.    The No. 12 Paradox weighs 84 lbs. and carries a bullet of 1 3/4 ounce  with 4 1/2 drams of powder. Although the powder charge is not sufficient  to produce a high express velocity, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36645"],[0,"Louisiana Beef Cattle (#2)"],[1,"was diminishing, and  now the herds of these nations, representing nine-tenths of the European  supply, are depleted as never before, while the one-tenth remaining  supply of the neighboring neutral nations is reduced by the drafts of  the warring powers.    The immense demand in recent years has caused the marketing of vast  numbers of the best improved cattle in the United States, including  great inroads upon the breeding herds, as cattle growers have marketed  their stock without regard to the future, looking solely to the large  immediate profits.    The depletion and deterioration of the breeding herds is a source of  great danger, as it cannot fail to result in a still further decrease in  production, and threatens to seriously impair the meat supply of the  American people.    As an infinitely worse condition prevails in the other cattle-producing  countries of the world, it is obvious that we cannot look to any  outside source of supply, either to replenish our herds, or to provide  our meat food requirements.    The increased cost of production in the North has resulted in the great  advancement of the dairying industry, to meet the American food  requirements.    In 1850 the milch cows on American farms numbered about 6,000,000. This  number was increased to 8,500,000 in 1860, and to about 13,000,000 in  1880; and the census of 1900 showed 17,100,000. In 1907, they numbered  20,625,000, and January 1, 1917, 22,768,000, or more than one-third of  our entire cattle herds.    The change from beef-cattle raising to dairying is most noticeable in  the Eastern and the North Central States, where the lack of pasturage  and the increased cost of forage make the production of beef less  profitable than formerly, while the proximity to large centers of  population and great cities has greatly stimulated the demand for dairy  products.    In some sections of the country dairying has encroached to such an  extent on the beef cattle industry that the latter has ceased to be a  factor of importance in those localities.    The beef cattle industry of the North is divided into two departments:  first, producing in the Far West; second, preparing for market in the  Middle West.    The Western producer can only provide grazing, and must then ship to the  Middle West feeder, who raises the corn with which he prepares the  cattle for market.    The shortness of the grazing season makes it impossible to put a  thousand-pound beef on the market in a year; consequently the stock must  be shipped to the Middle West in September, October or November, to be  fattened and prepared for the market.    The breeding herds and the stock not ready for shipment to the feeders  of the Middle West exist on the thin grasses, through eight  months--from September to June.    These sections of arid soil and thin vegetation are further handicapped  by the winters of intense cold, and of enforced housing and feeding;  for, during six or seven months, and even eight months, of each year,  there is scant vegetation to support animal life, and the struggle is a  severe one to sustain life itself against the encroachments of the  bitter temperature which so long prevails.    If the Middle West farmer should go into cattle-raising, his position  would be almost identical with that of the cattle grower of the Far  West, as his pasturage would be exhausted in October, and it would be  necessary to feed the cattle until May; otherwise, his loss would be  tremendous through partial starvation and exposure to inclement weather,  and he could not count upon the survival of more than 75 per cent of his  herd from one pasturing season to the next.    The farmer of the Middle West has six months of open weather, which must  be devoted exclusively to planting, cultivating and harvesting his corn  crop, and this crop takes up his land, leaving no acreage available for  summer pasturage.    He produces corn in the summer, and begins feeding in the fall.  According to the quality of cattle received from the Far West, he feeds  60, 90, and up to 120 days, when they are ready for market, and,  according to the old saying, are \"corn sold on the hoof.\"    Even the adoption of intensive methods does not enable the Northern  grower to successfully compete with the Southern grower, because  production in the North is limited to one-half the year, and the other  half is wholly unproductive, during which period his stores are being  consumed, without any returns whatever.    To house cattle during the winter is scarcely better than to leave them  exposed to the rigors of climate, as confinement brings the scourge of  tuberculosis; whereas in the South, and wherever life is spent in the  open, cattle enjoy immunity from this plague.    Furthermore, the year-round supply of green food in the South is  naturally conducive to the health and well-being of all animals, whereas  in the North, for several months in the year, only concentrated food is  available.    \"The South, with her short, mild winters, and her abundance of grasses,  can grow young cattle cheaper than the North.\"--W. J. Spillman, Chief of  the Bureau of Farm Management, United States Department of Agriculture.    A mild climate, luxuriant pastures, a great variety of forage crops, a  year-round supply of green food, and living outdoors all the year, are  the factors that make Southern Louisiana the ideal cattle-raising  section of the United States.    James Wilson, former Secretary of the United States Department of  Agriculture, at the National Live Stock Show held in New Orleans in  1916, said:    \"You have as fine domestic animals in the State of Louisiana today as  you will find anywhere; the finest breeds of cattle--Holstein and  others, as well as American breeds of Herefords, which are an  improvement over the English Hereford.\"    In the corn belt the lands are not so productive in grains and pasture  crops as the alluvial lands of Louisiana.    In the North the growing season for crops does not exceed six months; in  Louisiana the productive period is twelve months.    In Northern states, animals can be pastured in the fields during six or  seven months only; in Louisiana the animals may pasture in the open the  whole year.    In the North, extensive and costly barns and equipment are essential for  winter shelter and feeding, and vast quantities of grain, hay, ensilage,  and other foods, must be raised and stored, as the period of  winter-feeding extends over six months; in Louisiana, open sheds facing  south provide all the shelter needed, as aside from cold rains at  intervals during February or March, there are no rigors of climate.    Careful estimates by farm experts, and by authorities on cattle, place  the cost of production in Louisiana at less than 60 per cent of the cost  in the most favored corn-belt states.    There is no winter here, as understood in the North. Frost is a rarity,  frequently being absent for several years, and is never severe; the  rainfall is well distributed and averages 60 inches a year; extremes of  temperature are very rare; the average for January is 59 degrees, and  for July, 82 degrees, over the Gulf Coast area of Southern Louisiana;  and vegetation flourishes the year round.    The cost of summer feeding in Southern Louisiana, as compared with  summer feeding in the corn-belt states, shows a difference of about 25  per cent in favor of the former.    In winter feeding, the difference is altogether in favor of Louisiana.  Furthermore, practically none of the food consumed here is required to  keep up the animal heat, whereas 30 per cent of the food given Northern  cattle during the winter is absorbed by this requirement alone.    According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the cost of  ensilage in the Northern states ranges from $1.50 to $4 per ton, and it  is generally conceded that corn ensilage in the Middle West costs an  average of $2.50 per ton.    On the alluvial lands of Southern Louisiana it has been proved that  ensilage can be produced at 50 cents to $1.50 per ton, and the yield  per acre is two crops of ten to twenty tons each, as against one crop of  five to ten tons in the North.    According to the Bureau of Plant Industry, the best bluegrass pastures  of the North will carry only one head of cattle to two acres for about  six months of the year; whereas on the alluvial lands of Louisiana,  Bermuda grass and lespedeza combined forms permanent pasture which will  carry several head of cattle ten months on a single acre.    With a network of waterways and railroads, nearer the great consuming  markets of the East than any other important cattle-growing section, and  but a short distance from Chicago and the important markets of the  Middle States, Southern Louisiana occupies a strategic commercial  position of great money-value to those who raise cattle, as well as  other products.    Out of six thousand members of the American Hereford Society, a grower  from the Gulf Coast took the greatest number of prizes for a herd of  Hereford cattle, and also took the grand championship prize for a  Hereford bull, against the whole of the United States, which shows the  merit of this section of country.    The market today requires quality, and experience has proved that the  greatest profit comes through producing quality.    The day of the inferior, lightweight animal, which was marketed at two  to three and one-half years old, has passed.    The requirement now is for high-grade, one-year-old stock, weighing an  average of 1,000 pounds.    This stock can be produced in Louisiana under organized methods, at a  cost of 4-1/2 cents per pound, delivered at the market, and will bring a  price of 10 cents per pound.    Prior to the Civil War the best talent in America was devoted to  agricultural pursuits, which offered the greatest opportunity for making  large wealth--as wealth was counted in those days.
