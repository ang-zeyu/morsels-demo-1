The deepest shade of twilight did not send him from his favourite  plane-tree. He loved the soothing hour, when the last tints of light  die away; when the stars, one by one, tremble through aether, and are  reflected on the dark mirror of the waters; that hour, which, of all  others, inspires the mind with pensive tenderness, and often elevates  it to sublime contemplation. When the moon shed her soft rays among the  foliage, he still lingered, and his pastoral supper of cream and fruits  was often spread beneath it. Then, on the stillness of night, came the  song of the nightingale, breathing sweetness, and awakening melancholy.    The first interruptions to the happiness he had known since his  retirement, were occasioned by the death of his two sons. He lost them  at that age when infantine simplicity is so fascinating; and though,  in consideration of Madame St. Aubert's distress, he restrained the  expression of his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as he meant, with  philosophy, he had, in truth, no philosophy that could render him calm  to such losses. One daughter was now his only surviving child; and,  while he watched the unfolding of her infant character, with anxious  fondness, he endeavoured, with unremitting effort, to counteract  those traits in her disposition, which might hereafter lead her from  happiness. She had discovered in her early years uncommon delicacy  of mind, warm affections, and ready benevolence; but with these was  observable a degree of susceptibility too exquisite to admit of lasting  peace. As she advanced in youth, this sensibility gave a pensive tone to  her spirits, and a softness to her manner, which added grace to beauty,  and rendered her a very interesting object to persons of a congenial  disposition. But St. Aubert had too much good sense to prefer a charm  to a virtue; and had penetration enough to see, that this charm was too  dangerous to its possessor to be allowed the character of a blessing. He  endeavoured, therefore, to strengthen her mind; to enure her to habits  of self-command; to teach her to reject the first impulse of her  feelings, and to look, with cool examination, upon the disappointments  he sometimes threw in her way. While he instructed her to resist first  impressions, and to acquire that steady dignity of mind, that can alone  counterbalance the passions, and bear us, as far as is compatible with  our nature, above the reach of circumstances, he taught himself a  lesson of fortitude; for he was often obliged to witness, with seeming  indifference, the tears and struggles which his caution occasioned her.    In person, Emily resembled her mother; having the same elegant symmetry  of form, the same delicacy of features, and the same blue eyes, full  of tender sweetness. But, lovely as was her person, it was the varied  expression of her countenance, as conversation awakened the nicer  emotions of her mind, that threw such a captivating grace around her:     Those tend'rer tints, that shun the careless eye,   And, in the world's contagious circle, die.    St. Aubert cultivated her understanding with the most scrupulous care.  He gave her a general view of the sciences, and an exact acquaintance  with every part of elegant literature. He taught her Latin and English,  chiefly that she might understand the sublimity of their best poets. She  discovered in her early years a taste for works of genius; and it was  St. Aubert's principle, as well as his inclination, to promote every  innocent means of happiness. 'A well-informed mind,' he would say, 'is  the best security against the contagion of folly and of vice. The vacant  mind is ever on the watch for relief, and ready to plunge into error, to  escape from the languor of idleness. Store it with ideas, teach it the  pleasure of thinking; and the temptations of the world without, will  be counteracted by the gratifications derived from the world within.  Thought, and cultivation, are necessary equally to the happiness of a  country and a city life; in the first they prevent the uneasy sensations  of indolence, and afford a sublime pleasure in the taste they create for  the beautiful, and the grand; in the latter, they make dissipation less  an object of necessity, and consequently of interest.'    It was one of Emily's earliest pleasures to ramble among the scenes  of nature; nor was it in the soft and glowing landscape that she  most delighted; she loved more the wild wood-walks, that skirted the  mountain; and still more the mountain's stupendous recesses, where the  silence and grandeur of solitude impressed a sacred awe upon her heart,  and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. In scenes like  these she would often linger along, wrapt in a melancholy charm, till  the last gleam of day faded from the west; till the lonely sound of a  sheep-bell, or the distant bark of a watch-dog, were all that broke  on the stillness of the evening. Then, the gloom of the woods; the  trembling of their leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat,  flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights, now seen, and now  lost--were circumstances that awakened her mind into effort, and led to  enthusiasm and poetry.    Her favourite walk was to a little fishing-house, belonging to St.  Aubert, in a woody glen, on the margin of a rivulet that descended from  the Pyrenees, and, after foaming among their rocks, wound its silent  way beneath the shades it reflected. Above the woods, that screened this  glen, rose the lofty summits of the Pyrenees, which often burst boldly  on the eye through the glades below. Sometimes the shattered face of  a rock only was seen, crowned with wild shrubs; or a shepherd's cabin  seated on a cliff, overshadowed by dark cypress, or waving ash. Emerging  from the deep recesses of the woods, the glade opened to the distant  landscape, where the rich pastures and vine-covered slopes of Gascony  gradually declined to the plains; and there, on the winding shores of  the Garonne, groves, and hamlets, and villas--their outlines softened by  distance, melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint.    This, too, was the favourite retreat of St. Aubert, to which he  frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon, with his wife, his  daughter, and his books; or came at the sweet evening hour to welcome  the silent dusk, or to listen for the music of the nightingale.  Sometimes, too, he brought music of his own, and awakened every fairy  echo with the tender accents of his oboe; and often have the tones of  Emily's voice drawn sweetness from the waves, over which they trembled.    It was in one of these excursions to this spot, that she observed the  following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wainscot:     SONNET     Go, pencil! faithful to thy master's sighs!   Go--tell the Goddess of the fairy scene,   When next her light steps wind these wood-walks green,   Whence all his tears, his tender sorrows, rise;   Ah! paint her form, her soul-illumin'd eyes,   The sweet expression of her pensive face,   The light'ning smile, the animated grace--   The portrait well the lover's voice supplies;   Speaks all his heart must feel, his tongue would say:   Yet ah! not all his heart must sadly feel!   How oft the flow'ret's silken leaves conceal   The drug that steals the vital spark away!   And who that gazes on that angel-smile,   Would fear its charm, or think it could beguile!    These lines were not inscribed to any person; Emily therefore could not  apply them to herself, though she was undoubtedly the nymph of these  shades. Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance  without being detained by a suspicion as to whom they could be  addressed, she was compelled to rest in uncertainty; an uncertainty  which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers.  She had no leisure to suffer this circumstance, trifling at first, to  swell into importance by frequent remembrance. The little vanity it had  excited (for the incertitude which forbade her to presume upon having  inspired the sonnet, forbade her also to disbelieve it) passed away,  and the incident was dismissed from her thoughts amid her books, her  studies, and the exercise of social charities.    Soon after this period, her anxiety was awakened by the indisposition of  her father, who was attacked with a fever; which, though not thought to  be of a dangerous kind, gave a severe shock to his constitution.  Madame St. Aubert and Emily attended him with unremitting care; but  his recovery was very slow, and, as he advanced towards health, Madame  seemed to decline.    The first scene he visited, after he was well enough to take the  air, was his favourite fishing-house. A basket of provisions was sent  thither, with books, and Emily's lute; for fishing-tackle he had no use,  for he never could find amusement in torturing or destroying.    After employing himself, for about an hour, in botanizing, dinner was  served. It was a repast, to which gratitude, for being again permitted  to visit this spot, gave sweetness; and family happiness once more  smiled beneath these shades. Monsieur St. Aubert conversed with unusual  cheerfulness; every object delighted his senses. The refreshing pleasure  from the first view of nature, after the pain of illness, and the  confinement of a sick-chamber, is above the conceptions, as well as  the descriptions, of those in health. The green woods and pastures; the  flowery turf; the blue concave of the heavens; the balmy air; the murmur  of the limpid stream; and even the hum of every little insect of the  shade, seem to revivify the soul, and make mere existence bliss.    Madame St. Aubert, reanimated by the cheerfulness and recovery of her  husband, was no longer sensible of the indisposition which had lately  oppressed her; and, as she sauntered along "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#2)"],[1," true picture of an Eddorian's--_any_  Eddorian's--mind. They were intolerant, domineering, rapacious,  insatiable, cold, callous, and brutal. They were keen, capable,  persevering, analytical, and efficient. They had no trace of any of the  softer emotions or sensibilities possessed by races adherent to  Civilization. No Eddorian ever had anything even remotely resembling a  sense of humor.    While not essentially bloodthirsty--that is, not loving bloodshed for  its own sweet sake--they were no more averse to blood-letting than they  were in favor of it. Any amount of killing which would or which might  advance an Eddorian toward his goal was commendable; useless slaughter  was frowned upon, not because it was slaughter, but because it was  useless--and hence inefficient.    And, instead of the multiplicity of goals sought by the various entities  of any race of Civilization, each and every Eddorian had only one. The  same one: power. _Power!_ P-O-W-E-R!!    Since Eddore was peopled originally by various races, perhaps as similar  to each other as are the various human races of Earth, it is  understandable that the early history of the planet--while it was still  in its own space, that is--was one of continuous and ages-long war. And,  since war always was and probably always will be linked solidly to  technological advancement, the race now known simply as \"The Eddorians\"  became technologists supreme. All other races disappeared. So did all  other forms of life, however lowly, which interfered in any way with the  Masters of the Planet.    Then, all racial opposition liquidated and overmastering lust as  unquenched as ever, the surviving Eddorians fought among themselves:  \"push-button\" wars employing engines of destruction against which the  only possible defense was a fantastic thickness of planetary bedrock.    Finally, unable either to kill or to enslave each other, the  comparatively few survivors made a peace of sorts. Since their own space  was practically barren of planetary systems, they would move their  planet from space to space until they found one which so teemed with  planets that each living Eddorian could become the sole Master of an  ever increasing number of worlds. This was a program very much  worthwhile, promising as it did an outlet for even the recognizedly  insatiable Eddorian craving for power. Therefore the Eddorians, for the  first time in their prodigiously long history of fanatical  non-cooperation, decided to pool their resources of mind and of material  and to work as a group.    Union of a sort was accomplished eventually; neither peaceably nor  without highly lethal friction. They knew that a democracy, by its very  nature, was inefficient; hence a democratic form of government was not  even considered. An efficient government must of necessity be  dictatorial. Nor were they all exactly alike or of exactly equal  ability; perfect identity of any two such complex structures was in fact  impossible, and any difference, however slight, was ample justification  for stratification in such a society as theirs.    Thus one of them, fractionally more powerful and more ruthless than the  rest, became the All-Highest--His Ultimate Supremacy--and a group of  about a dozen others, only infinitesimally weaker, became his Council; a  cabinet which was later to become known as the Innermost Circle. The  tally of this cabinet varied somewhat from age to age; increasing by one  when a member divided, decreasing by one when a jealous fellow or an  envious underling managed to perpetrate a successful assassination.    And thus, at long last, the Eddorians began really to work together.  There resulted, among other things, the hyper-spatial tube and the fully  inertialess drive--the drive which was, millions of years later, to be  given to Civilization by an Arisian operating under the name of  Bergenholm. Another result, which occured shortly after the galactic  inter-passage had begun, was the eruption into normal space of the  planet Eddore.    \"I must now decide whether to make this space our permanent headquarters  or to search farther,\" the All-Highest radiated harshly to his Council.  \"On the one hand, it will take some time for even those planets which  have already formed to cool. Still more will be required for life to  develop sufficiently to form a part of the empire which we have planned  or to occupy our abilities to any great degree. On the other, we have  already spent millions of years in surveying hundreds of millions of  continua, without having found anywhere such a profusion of planets as  will, in all probability, soon fill both of these galaxies. There may  also be certain advantages inherent in the fact that these planets are  not yet populated. As life develops, we can mold it as we please.  Krongenes, what are your findings in regard to the planetary  possibilities of other spaces?\"    The term \"Krongenes\" was not, in the accepted sense, a name. Or, rather,  it was more than a name. It was a key-thought, in mental shorthand; a  condensation and abbreviation of the life-pattern or ego of that  particular Eddorian.    \"Not at all promising, Your Supremacy,\" Krongenes replied promptly. \"No  space within reach of my instruments has more than a small fraction of  the inhabitable worlds which will presently exist in this one.\"    \"Very well. Have any of you others any valid objections to the  establishment of our empire here in this space? If so, give me your  thought now.\"    No objecting thoughts appeared, since none of the monsters then knew  anything of Arisia or of the Arisians. Indeed, even if they had known,  it is highly improbable that any objection would have been raised.  First, because no Eddorian, from the All-Highest down, could conceive or  would under any circumstances admit that any race, anywhere, had ever  approached or ever would approach the Eddorians in any quality  whatever; and second, because, as is routine in all dictatorships,  disagreement with the All-Highest did not operate to lengthen the span  of life.    \"Very well. We will now confer as to ... but hold! That thought is not  one of ours! Who are you, stranger, to dare to intrude thus upon a  conference of the Innermost Circle?\"    \"I am Enphilistor, a younger student, of the planet Arisia.\" This name,  too, was a symbol. Nor was the young Arisian yet a Watchman, as he and  so many of his fellows were so soon to become, for before Eddore's  arrival Arisia had had no need of Watchmen. \"I am not intruding, as you  know. I have not touched any one of your minds; have not read any one of  your thoughts. I have been waiting for you to notice my presence, so  that we could become acquainted with each other. A surprising  development, truly--we have thought for many cycles of time that we were  the only highly advanced life in this universe....\"    \"Be silent, worm, in the presence of the Masters. Land your ship and  surrender, and your planet will be allowed to serve us. Refuse, or even  hesitate, and every individual of your race shall die.\"    \"Worm? Masters? Land my ship?\" The young Arisian's thought was pure  curiosity, with no tinge of fear, dismay, or awe. \"Surrender? Serve you?  I seem to be receiving your thought without ambiguity, but your meaning  is entirely....\"    \"Address me as 'Your Supremacy',\" the All-Highest directed, coldly.  \"Land now or die now--this is your last warning.\"    \"Your Supremacy? Certainly, if that is the customary form. But as to  landing--and warning--and dying--surely you do not think that I am  present in the flesh? And can it be possible that you are actually so  aberrant as to believe that you can kill me--or even the youngest  Arisian infant? What a peculiar--what an _extraordinary_--psychology!\"    \"Die, then, worm, if you must have it so!\" the All-Highest snarled, and  launched a mental bolt whose energies were calculated to slay any living  thing.    Enphilistor, however, parried the vicious attack without apparent  effort. His manner did not change. He did not strike back.    The Eddorian then drove in with an analyzing probe, only to be surprised  again--the Arisian's thought could not be traced! And Enphilistor, while  warding off the raging Eddorian, directed a quiet thought as though he  were addressing someone close by his side:    \"Come in, please, one or more of the Elders. There is a situation here  which I am not qualified to handle.\"    \"We, the Elders of Arisia in fusion, are here.\" A grave, deeply resonant  pseudo-voice filled the Eddorians' minds; each perceived in  three-dimensional fidelity an aged, white-bearded human face. \"You of  Eddore have been expected. The course of action which we must take has  been determined long since. You will forget this incident completely.  For cycles upon cycles of time to come no Eddorian shall know that we  Arisians exist.\"    Even before the thought was issued the fused Elders had gone quietly and  smoothly to work. The Eddorians forgot utterly the incident which had  just happened. Not one of them retained in his conscious mind any  inkling that Eddore did not possess the only intelligent life in space.           *       *       *       *       *    And upon distant Arisia a full meeting of minds was held.    \"But why didn't you simply kill them?\" Enphilistor asked. \"Such action  would be distasteful in the extreme, of course--almost impossible--but  even I can perceive....\" He paused, overcome by his thought.    \"That which you perceive, youth, is but a very small fraction of the  whole. We did not attempt to slay them because we could not have done  so. Not because of squeamishness, as you intimate, but from sheer  inability. The Eddorian tenacity of life is a thing far beyond your  present understanding; to have attempted to kill them would have  rendered it impossible to make them forget us. We must have time ...  cycles and cycles of time.\" The fusion broke off, pondered for minutes,  then"]]]
