His success would terrify the artist; he would  rush away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope  that, left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had communicated  would fade; that this thing, which had received such imperfect  animation, would subside into dead matter; and he might sleep in the  belief that the silence of the grave would quench for ever the transient  existence of the hideous corpse which he had looked upon as the cradle  of life. He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold the  horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and looking on  him with yellow, watery, but speculative eyes.    I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill of  fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my  fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the  dark _parquet_, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling  through, and the sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps  were beyond. I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still  it haunted me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred to my  ghost story,--my tiresome unlucky ghost story! O! if I could only  contrive one which would frighten my reader as I myself had been  frightened that night!    Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me. \"I  have found it! What terrified me will terrify others; and I need only  describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.\" On the  morrow I announced that I had _thought of a story_. I began that day  with the words, _It was on a dreary night of November_, making only a  transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.    At first I thought but of a few pages--of a short tale; but Shelley  urged me to develope the idea at greater length. I certainly did not owe  the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to  my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken  the form in which it was presented to the world. From this declaration I  must except the preface. As far as I can recollect, it was entirely  written by him.    And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I  have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when  death and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart.  Its several pages speak of many a walk, many a drive, and many a  conversation, when I was not alone; and my companion was one who, in  this world, I shall never see more. But this is for myself; my readers  have nothing to do with these associations.    I will add but one word as to the alterations I have made. They are  principally those of style. I have changed no portion of the story, nor  introduced any new ideas or circumstances. I have mended the language  where it was so bald as to interfere with the interest of the narrative;  and these changes occur almost exclusively in the beginning of the first  volume. Throughout they are entirely confined to such parts as are mere  adjuncts to the story, leaving the core and substance of it untouched.    M. W. S.    _London, October 15, 1831._          PREFACE.      The event on which this fiction is founded, has been supposed, by Dr.  Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of  impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest  degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as  the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely  weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the  interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere  tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of  the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical  fact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of  human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the  ordinary relations of existing events can yield.    I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary  principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon  their combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,--Shakspeare,  in the Tempest, and Midsummer Night's Dream,--and most especially  Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most humble  novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours,  may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a  rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human  feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.    The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual  conversation. It was commenced partly as a source of amusement, and  partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind.  Other motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded. I am by  no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies  exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the  reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the  avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to  the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the  excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from  the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived  as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to  be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical  doctrine of whatever kind.    It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this  story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally  laid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the  summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy,  and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and  occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which  happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful  desire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of  whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can  ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded  on some supernatural occurrence.    The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me  on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which  they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is  the only one which has been completed.    Marlow, September, 1817.          FRANKENSTEIN;    OR,    THE MODERN PROMETHEUS.          LETTER I.      _To Mrs. Saville, England._    St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.    You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the  commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil  forebodings. I arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my  dear sister of my welfare, and increasing confidence in the success of  my undertaking.    I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of  Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which  braces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this  feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which  I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by  this wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try  in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and  desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of  beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its  broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual  splendour. There--for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust  in preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing  over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in  beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its  productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of  the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there  discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate  a thousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage to  render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate  my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before  visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.  These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of  danger or death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with  the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday  mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But, supposing  all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable  benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by  discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which  at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret  of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an  undertaking such as mine.    These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my  letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to  heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a  steady purpose,--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have  read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been  made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the  seas which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#2)"],[1,"of surprise that so little is to be found regarding  the mounds in the older records of the Northern States. There is  but one statement in the Jesuit Relations and no mention in the  writings of the Recollects, so far has been found, and yet one of  the missionaries must have passed a good portion of the winter of  1700 in the very midst of the Cahokia group. Colden notes that \"a  round hill was sometimes raised over the grave in which a corpse  had been deposited.\" [Footnote: Hist. Five Nations, introd., vol.  1, London, 1755, p. 16.] Carver noticed ancient earthworks on the  Mississippi near Lake Pepin, but knew nothing of their origin.  [Footnote: Travels, ed. 1796, Phila., p. 36; ed. 1779, London, p.  57.] Heckewelder observed some of these works near Detroit, which  he was informed had been built by the Indians. An account of them  was published in a Philadelphia periodical in 1780 or 1790. This  description was afterwards given briefly in his \"History of the  Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations.\"    These older records mention facts which afford a reasonable  explanation of some of the ancient monuments found in the northern  section of the country; as for example the communal or tribal  burials, where the bones and remains of all the dead of a village,  region, or tribe, who had died since the last general burial  (usually a period of eight to ten years) were collected and  deposited in one common grave. This method, which was followed by  some southern tribes, has been described by Bartram, [Footnote:  Travels (1791), p.516.] Dumont, [Footnote: Memoires Hist. La.,  vol. 1, p. 246.] Romans, [Footnote: Nat. and Civil Hist. Fla., pp.  88-90.] and others, but most fully by Jean deo Brebeuf. [Footnote:  In his account \"Des ceremonies qu'ils [les Hurons] gardent en leur  sepulture et de leur deuil,\" and \"De la Feste solemnelle des  morts.\"--Jesuit Relations for 1636, pp. 129-139. See translation  in Thomas's \"Burial Mounds of the Northern Section of the United  States,\" Fifth Annual Rept. Bur. Ethnol., p. 110. See also  Lafitau, \"Moeurs des Sauvages,\" vol. 2, pp. 447-455.]    It is a well-attested fact that northern as well as southern  Indians were accustomed to erect palisades around their villages  for defense against attack.    Some evidences of mound building by northern Indians may be found  in the works of comparatively modern writers. Lewis C. Beck  [Footnote: Gazetteer of the States of Ill. and Mo., p. 308.]  affirms that \"one of the largest mounds in this country has been  thrown upon this stream [the Osage] within the last thirty or  forty years by the Osages, near the great Osage village, in honor  of one of their deceased chiefs.\" It is probable this is the mound  referred to by Major Sibley, [Footnote: Featherstoubaugh, Excur.  through Slave States, p. 70.] who says an Osage Indian informed  him that a chief of his tribe having died while all the men were  off on a hunt, he was buried in the usual manner, with his  weapons, etc., and a small mound was raised over him. When the  hunters returned this mound was enlarged at intervals, every man  carrying materials, and so the work went on for a long time, and  the mound, when finished, was dressed off to a conical form at the  top. The old Indian further said he had been informed, and  believed, that all the mounds had a similar origin.    Lewis and Clarke mention not only the erection of a mound over a  modern chief, but also numerous earthworks, including mounds,  which were known to be the work of contemporaneous Indians.  [Footnote: Travels, Dublin ed., 1817, pp. 30, 31, 55, 67, 115,  117, 122-125, etc.]    L. V. Bierce [Footnote: Historical Reminiscences of Summit County,  Ohio, p. 128.] states that when Nicksaw, an old Wyandotte Indian  of Summit County, was killed, \"the Indians buried him on the  ground where he fell, and according to their custom raised a mound  over him to commemorate the place and circumstances of his death.  His grave is yet to be seen.\"    Another writer says: \"It is related by intelligent Indian traders  that a custom once prevailed among certain tribes, on the burial  of a chief or brave of distinction, to consider his grave as  entitled to the tribute of a portion of earth from each passer-by,  which the traveler sedulously carried with him on his journey.  Hence the first grave formed a nucleus around which, in the  accumulation of the accustomed tributes thus paid, a mound was  soon formed.\" [Footnote: Smith's History of Wisconsin, vol. 3,  1834, p. 245.]    The same author says [Footnote: Ibid., p. 262.] the tumulus at the  Great Butte des Morts (Great Hill of the Dead) was raised over the  bones of Outagami (Fox Indian) warriors slain in battle with the  French in 1706.    According to a Winnebago tradition, mounds in certain localities  in Wisconsin were built by that tribe, and others by the Sacs and  Foxes.[Footnote: Wis. Hist. Soc., Rept. I, pp. 88, 89.]    There is another Indian tradition, apparently founded on fact,  that the Essex mounds in Clinton County, Mich., are the burying  places of those killed in a battle between the Chippewas and  Pottawatomies, which occurred not many generations ago. [Footnote:  Smithsonian Report, part 1, 1884, p. 848.]            CHAPTER II.    SIMILARITY OF THE ARTS AND CUSTOMS OF THE MOUND  BUILDERS TO THOSE OF INDIANS.      The historical evidence is, as we have seen, conclusive that some  of the tribes of Indians were mound builders.    The explorations by the Bureau of Ethnology in the South and West  have also brought to light so many corroborative facts that the  question may be considered settled. These will shortly be given to  the public; only a few can be noticed here, and that in a very  brief and general way.    As the country was inhabited only by Indians at the time of its  discovery, and as we have no evidence, unless derived from the  mounds, of its having ever been occupied by any other people,  every fact indicating a similarity between the arts, customs, and  social life of the mound-builders and those of the red Indians, is  an evidence of the identity of the two peoples. The greater the  number of these resemblances, the greater the probability of the  correctness of the theory, so long as we find nothing  irreconcilable with it.    Architecture.--One of the first circumstances which strike the  mind of the archaeologist who carefully studies these works as  being very significant, is the entire absence of any evidence in  them of architectural knowledge and skill approaching that  exhibited by the ruins of Mexico and Central America, or even  equaling that exhibited by the Pueblo Indians.    It is true that truncated pyramidal mounds of large size and  somewhat regular proportions are found in certain sections, and  that some of these have ramps or roadways leading up to them. Yet  when compared with the pyramids or teocalli of Mexico and Yucatan  the differences in the manifestations of architectural skill are  so great, and the resemblances are so faint and few, as to furnish  no grounds whatever for attributing the two classes of works to  the same people. The facts that the works of the one people  consist chiefly of wrought and sculptured stone, and that such  materials are wholly unknown to the other, forbid the idea of any  relationship between the two. The difference between the two  classes of monuments indicates a wide divergence--a complete step  --in the culture status.    Mexico, Central America, and Peru are dotted with the ruins of  stone edifices, but in all the mound-building area of the United  States not the slightest vestige of one attributable to the people  who erected the earthen structures is to be found. The utmost they  attained in this direction was the construction of stone cairus,  rude stone--walls, and vaults of cobble-stones and undressed  blocks. This fact is too significant to be overlooked in this  comparison, and should have its weight in forming a conclusion,  especially when it is backed by numerous other important  differences.    Though hundreds of groups of mounds marking the sites of ancient  villages are to be seen scattered over the Mississippi Valley and  Gulf States yet nowhere can there be found an ancient house. The  inference is therefore irresistible that the houses of the mound-  builders were constructed of perishable materials; consequently  that the builders were not sufficiently advanced in art to use  stone or brick in building, or else that they lived a roving,  restless life that would not justify the time and trouble  necessary to erect such permanent structures. As the last  inference is irreconcilable with the magnitude and extent of many  groups of these remains we are forced to the conclusion that the  first is true.    One chief objection to the Indian origin of these works is, as  already stated, that their builders must have been sedentary,  depending largely upon agriculture for subsistence. It is evident,  therefore, that they had dwellings of some sort, and as remains of  neither stone nor brick structures are found which could have been  used for this purpose, we must assume that their dwellings were  constructed of perishable material, such as was supplied in  abundance by the forest region in which they dwelt. It is  therefore apparent that in this respect at least the dwellings of  mound-builders were similar to those of Indians. But this is not  all that can be said in reference to the houses of the former, for  there still remain indications of their shape and character,  although no complete examples are left for inspection. In various  places, especially in Tennessee, Illinois, and southeast Missouri,  the sites of thousands of them are yet distinctly marked by little  circular depressions with rings of earth around them. These  remains give the form and size of one class of dwellings that was  common in the regions named. Excavations in the center usually"]]]
