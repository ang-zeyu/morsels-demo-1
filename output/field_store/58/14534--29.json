Of all of  the species in the _pictipes_ group, _xanthosticta_ most closely  resembles _debilis_. This species has a dull green dorsum, usually  flecked with brown or black, and a creamy white venter. The flanks of  _debilis_ are creamy white with small brown flecks, and the anterior and  posterior surfaces of the thighs are bright yellow. _Hyla debilis_ has a  dull tan canthal stripe and white spots on the upper lip; the webbing on  the hand is slightly more extensive, and the discs are slightly larger,  in _debilis_ than in _xanthosticta_.    The presence of the large yellow spots on the flanks and thighs in  combination with the uniformly green dorsum and yellow venter  immediately distinguishes _Hyla xanthosticta_ from all other known  species of Middle American hylids.    _Remarks._--The only known specimen of _Hyla xanthosticta_ was perched  at night on a leaf about one meter above the ground. The frog was found  in humid upper montane forest characterized by large oaks supporting  many bromeliads and heavy growths of mosses. Two other members of the  _Hyla pictipes_ group--_pictipes_ and _rivularis_--were abundant along a  stream in the oak forest.    The specific name is derived from the Greek _xanthos_ meaning yellow and  the Greek _stiktos_ meaning spotted, and alludes to the diagnostic  yellow spots on the flanks and thighs.      Hyla pseudopuma infucata new subspecies    Plate 17    _Holotype._--Adult male, KU 101770 from the Rio Changena, Bocas del Toro  Province, Panama, elevation 830 meters; obtained May 18, 1966, by  William E.

Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of upper surfaces of thighs,  bordered below by vertical flesh folds; anal sheath absent. Skin of  belly, ventral surfaces of arms, and proximal posteroventral surfaces of  thighs granular, elsewhere smooth. Tongue ovoid, about twice as long as  wide, shallowly notched posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine  teeth 5-6, situated on transverse ridges between posterior borders of  small round choanae. Vocal slit extending from midlateral edge of tongue  to angle of jaw.    Color (in preservative): dorsum grayish tan with large brown blotch  extending from eyelids to middle of back, limbs marked with brown  transverse bars, 2 on each forearm, 3 on each thigh, shank, and foot.  Flanks dark gray with white spots; groin, anterior and posterior  surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of shanks, and inner edges of feet  orange-tan; anal region dark brown, bordered above by white stripe;  belly and chin creamy white, latter with grayish brown flecks.    Color (in life): dorsum yellowish tan with olive-brown markings by night  and uniform pale yellowish tan by day; axilla, inner surface of elbow,  groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of  thighs and shanks, inner surfaces of feet, and dorsal surfaces of first  three toes tomato red; flanks dark blue with yellow spots and  reticulations. Throat, chest, and anterior part of belly creamy white;  posterior part of belly orange, becoming red in extreme posterior  region; throat flecked with brown; iris pale bronze with black  reticulations; palpebral membrane clear above, yellowish tan below;  nuptial excrescenses dark brown.    _Variation._--The discussion of variation is based on the type series  plus 31 specimens (KU 101781-811) from the Rio Claro near its junction  with the Rio Changena, at an elevation of 910 meters. Females are  slightly larger than males, but do not differ significantly in  proportions (Table 1). All specimens have the diagnostic red legs and  blue flanks with yellow spots or mottling, but the dorsal pattern is  highly variable. In most individuals the dark markings on the dorsum are  a solid color, but in some the borders of the marks are dark, and the  interior of each mark is nearly the same color as the rest of the  dorsum. A triangular dark mark with the anterolateral corners on the  eyelids is present in all specimens. In some individuals the posteriorly  directed apex of this triangular mark is connected to the apex of  another triangular mark on the back; in other individuals the marks are  narrowly separated, whereas in a few specimens the marks are broadly  connected. A dark blotch usually is present on the posterior end of the  body. One specimen (KU 101771) has many small white spots on the dorsum.  The white stripe above the anus is invariably present, and the  transverse bars on the limbs are present in all specimens, although they  are indistinct in some individuals. The pattern on the flanks varies  from three or four large spots to many (30-44) small spots. All males  have dark flecks or reticulations on the throat; in some individuals the  chest and belly are heavily flecked. Although the amount of flecking is  much less in most females, one individual is as heavily flecked on the  throat and belly as any male.    The change in coloration in this frog is noteworthy. The following  description of metachrosis in seven specimens from the Rio Claro  illustrates the change. At night the frogs were yellowish tan above with  slightly darker dorsal markings. The axilla, groin, anterior and  posterior surfaces of the thighs, ventral surfaces of the hind limbs,  and webbing on the hands and feet were tomato red. By day, some  individuals became creamy yellow, others ashy white, and others grayish  tan. The flanks were dark blue with yellow spots.    _Comparisons._--The population of frogs described here closely resembles  _Hyla pseudopuma_ Guenther in the highlands of Costa Rica. Both have the  same kind of, and variation in, dorsal markings; conical, pigmented  supernumerary tubercles on the toes; bilobate vocal sac; and large  prepollex bearing horny nuptial spinules. Although at present no  evidence for intergradation exists, the population described here is  considered to be a subspecies of _Hyla pseudopuma_.    The two subspecies exhibit few differences in size and proportions,  except that the tympanum is larger in _pseudopuma_ (Table 1). _Hyla p.  pseudopuma_ has dark brown or yellowish tan thighs and brown flanks with  a few creamy white spots; the groin in some specimens is pale blue. The  red color on the limbs characteristic of _infucata_ is lacking in  _pseudopuma_, which also lacks the white stripe above the anus  characteristic of _infucata_. The only noticeable morphological  difference"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33972"],[0,"Florida: An Ideal Cattle State (#2)"],[1,"anywhere, but in the South  particularly.    With the knowledge that I might be here some time this winter, I talked  to two of the great packers about the development of the beef industry  in the South, and they both said that they thought the South was going  to come to the front very rapidly, and that either they or some one else  would undoubtedly keep pace with the development by enlarging their  present facilities or building new packing houses.    In that connection a packer loves a hog country to work in conjunction  with cattle. Without giving the topic any more than this general  statement, I can see where hog production is going to be one of the  great things in Florida, and that while in Texas we do not attempt to  produce any hogs along with our cattle, that hogs will be to some extent  a part of the great pasture problems.    In a general way, conditions are very similar in Florida now to those of  some thirty-five years ago in Texas, at which time that State was an  open range proposition. Today, with the exception of a very small strip  along the Gulf Coast, the entire State of Texas is under fence, and in a  general way has been under fence for nearly twenty years.    There has never been a time in the State of Texas in the past twenty  years when practically all of the grazing area of the State has not been  occupied, and as against the cattle carried on the open range with  practically no water development, the pastures of Texas, which are known  as the range (but the word range in Texas means large bodies of inclosed  land), are carrying several hundred per cent more cattle than at that  time.    The thing which in Texas led to great hardships alike to the large  pasture owner and to the settler himself was the fact that so much of  the land did not lie in solid bodies. I judge that in the main there is  much less of this in Florida than in Texas, and that either by  partition, or purchase, or auxiliary lease, the great bulk of that  complication can be handled.    And that brings me to the principle of fencing, which I think may be  covered under the general heading of Control. First, it means defined  ownership, which is always recognized. It means fire control, because it  eliminates the wantonness which we now find all over your open range,  each man working out his problem and firing the range for various  causes.    Fencing means that an area may be developed to its capacity. For  instance, on your ranges fire kills the various varieties of the carpet  or blanket grass and kills the little blue cane, as well as any number  of other grasses, all of which, however, come back where an area is  protected, and as they are among your very best feeds, the carrying  capacity of a pasture is materially increased.    Water may be developed through the windmill process directly in  proportion with the needs of the cattle and concentrated to them as  against any water development on the open range.    It is a scientific fact that eradication of the tick may be accomplished  by resting a pasture for a certain time. Fencing means the concentration  of that area to the best bulls as against not only their mixture with  the scrub bulls on the open range, but the fact that the old Spanish  fighting blood in the scrub bull materially reduces the effectiveness of  the higher class bull. Fencing means that if on any favorable areas you  wish to introduce any of the wonderful grasses which the Department of  Agriculture is showing can be spread very rapidly, it can be done  concentrating to ownership.    Fencing means that lands which are now being occupied by some one else  without revenue, but at an expense, may be made to either pay a fair  interest on the investment of land, improvements and cattle, or at least  a rental revenue which will take care of taxes, interest on improvements  and become a net economy, as against the open range.    I believe, too, that the principle will stand that a property defined by  fences immediately takes on increased value; that the buyer would pay  more for it per acre defined than looking at it in the abstract as part  of the open range.    I do not think that in the whole State of Texas you will find a single  land owner, who has fenced his ranches, who does not know that it has  been done at a splendid profit.    You begin your problem with a tick-wide eradication law, which Texas has  only had a very short time. You begin it at a time when the Government  and most of the tick-infested states are releasing thousands of square  miles every year, and at a time when both science and every practical  observer understands it as an economic measure, which may be pursued  with practically no detriment or danger to the cattle. I think that we  probably dipped in the neighborhood of a million cattle, considering the  number of times that they were dipped, and we did not lose a total of  fifty head from all causes.    Eradication means larger cattle in better condition on the same feeds  and a less mortality. It means that they can go anywhere in America  without restriction; or, in other words, a broader market and no  punishment just before shipment. I do not think that the perpetuity of  the tick can be defended from any economic standpoint.    I want to take up the breeding section, first with reference to what  your cattle represent and a comparison with primitive cattle in other  countries. I am advised on reliable authority that forty years ago the  only ready money in this country came from the cattle men who either  topped their bulls and took them to Cuba, or the Cubans came here and  topped them, taking the very best sires that you produced for sport and  slaughter. You have, therefore, for forty years been grading down, as  far as the sire is concerned.    In the matter of the cows, there has been no culling, added to which  there has been in-breeding, and on both the sire and dam side following  out the law that evil qualities intensify in posterity, the tendency has  been down instead of up in the breeding of native cattle for forty  years, to which the only relief has been a very limited introduction of  the beef strains.    In addition to this, the cattle have been infested with ticks, and every  evil influence that could arrest their development seems to have had a  good chance at them, and yet in spite of all this I find them on the  whole much better than I had expected.    I have been trying to make a comparison between them and the primitive  cattle of Texas, which I have known for fifty years, as they were  pastured next to my father's farm in great quantities when I was only  seven years old and long before there was any process of improvement. I  think the Texas cattle had greater scale, but from all I can learn I do  not believe they had any greater vitality. I think, on the whole,  though, that in evolving a race of cattle you have a little further to  go than Texas had.    Mr. Alvin Sanders, Editor of the Breeders' Gazette, in his book, \"The  Story of the Herefords,\" traces very carefully the first introduction  of blooded bulls to the Texas and Western ranges, and forty years,  certainly forty-five, is as far back as that influence began. My own  people began on primitive Texas cattle in 1882, but from that time used  only full-blooded sires, about ninety per cent Hereford and about ten  per cent Shorthorn, and only about three years after I went with them  sixteen years ago, I took selected calves from their herd to Chicago and  won grand sweepstakes for feeder cattle with them against all  competition from all sections of the United States. When I went to the  S. M. S. herd I found a wonderful lot of breeding cows, the bulk of them  at least fifteen-sixteenths and only requiring a vigorous culling  process to bring them to a remarkably high standard.    I was identified with Mr. Kirk Armour during the great progress in  grading up Texas herds in the '90's, and it was noticeable in the stock  yards that in a short space of about six years there was an absolute  change in the general run of cattle from the ranges to the yards from  primitive cattle to cattle showing very appreciable improvement, and in  twelve years the longhorn had become a scarcity; he was practically  extinct in 1900.    Argentina during the same period evolved from a primitive race of cattle  one which will compare very favorably to that of America in its  up-grading. The other South American Republics have been slower, but  between Argentina and America two demonstrations have been given within  my own lifetime of a race of cattle absolutely redeemed from the  primitive to practically full-bloods, and that the first twelve years of  that work has resulted in animals showing fifty per cent increase in  weight under the same conditions, a much higher degree of meat in the  rib and loin and round, with an immense improvement in their instinct  for putting on weight on the same feed over the primitive cattle.    I am simply taking these generally demonstrated laws of breeding to  apply to your conditions. I am sure that by using good sires you will  find an immense improvement in three years; that in six years it will be  a revelation, and that in twelve years you will have a race of cattle  for which the world will make a path to your door.    To arrive at this process I must first disclaim any thought of urging  any particular breed upon you. On the other hand, I could not be fair to  the problem without calling your attention to the fact that the Hereford  has been the redeemer of the great Western ranges. I am sure, however,  that the greater the degree of purity that you use in him, up to at  least a seven-eighths, will be shown in the result.    I find that there is some prejudice against the Hereford in Florida, but  as far as I can follow it they apparently got a very low grade of  bulls--I am inclined to think not over half-breeds, and then, too, they  found"]]]
