H.M.S. _St. George_, H.M.S. _Thrush_, H.M.S. _Philomel_, H.M.S. _Phoebe_  sailed from Simonstown, and H.M.S. _Dwarf_ came down from Sierra Leone  _hec dum_, and in less than a month after the king killed his guest he  wished he hadn't.    Headquarters sent Sanders to clear up the political side of the mess.    He was shown round what was left of the king's city by the  flag-lieutenant of the _St. George_.    \"I am afraid,\" said that gentleman, apologetically, \"I am afraid that  you will have to dig out a new king; we've rather killed the old one.\"    Sanders nodded.    \"I shall not go into mourning,\" he said.    There was no difficulty in finding candidates for the vacant post.  Sato-Koto, the dead king's brother, expressed his willingness to assume  the cares of office with commendable promptitude.    \"What do you say?\" asked the admiral, commanding the expedition.    \"I say no, sir,\" said Sanders, without hesitation. \"The king has a son,  a boy of nine; the kingship must be his. As for Sato-Koto, he shall be  regent at pleasure.\"    And so it was arranged, Sato-Koto sulkily assenting.    They found the new king hidden in the woods with the women folk, and he  tried to bolt, but Sanders caught him and led him back to the city by  the ear.    \"My boy,\" he said kindly, \"how do people call you?\"    \"Peter, master,\" whimpered the wriggling lad; \"in the fashion of the  white people.\"    \"Very well,\" said Sanders, \"you shall be King Peter, and rule this  country wisely and justly according to custom and the law. And you shall  do hurt to none, and put shame on none nor shall you kill or raid or do  any of the things that make life worth living, and if you break loose,  may the Lord help you!\"    Thus was King Peter appointed monarch of the Isisi people, and Sanders  went back to head-quarters with the little army of bluejackets and  Houssas, for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, had been slain at the taking of  the city, and Sanders' work was finished.    The story of the taking of Isisi village, and the crowning of the young  king, was told in the London newspapers, and lost nothing in the  telling. It was so described by the special correspondents, who  accompanied the expedition, that many dear old ladies of Bayswater wept,  and many dear young ladies of Mayfair said: \"How sweet!\" and the outcome  of the many emotions which the description evoked was the sending out  from England of Miss Clinton Calbraith, who was an M.A., and  unaccountably pretty.    She came out to \"mother\" the orphan king, to be a mentor and a friend.  She paid her own passage, but the books which she brought and the school  paraphernalia that filled two large packing cases were subscribed for  by the tender readers of _Tiny Toddlers_, a magazine for infants.  Sanders met her on the landing-stage, being curious to see what a white  woman looked like.    He put a hut at her disposal and sent the wife of his coast clerk to  look after her.    \"And now, Miss Calbraith,\" he said, at dinner that night, \"what do you  expect to do with Peter?\"    She tilted her pretty chin in the air reflectively.    \"We shall start with the most elementary of lessons--the merest  kindergarten, and gradually work up. I shall teach him calisthenics, a  little botany--Mr. Sanders, you're laughing.\"    \"No, I wasn't,\" he hastened to assure her; \"I always make a face like  that--er--in the evening. But tell me this--do you speak the  language--Swaheli, Bomongo, Fingi?\"    \"That will be a difficulty,\" she said thoughtfully.    \"Will you take my advice?\" he asked.    \"Why, yes.\"    \"Well, learn the language.\" She nodded. \"Go home and learn it.\" She  frowned. \"It will take you about twenty-five years.\"    \"Mr. Sanders,\" she said, not without dignity, \"you are pulling--you are  making fun of me.\"    \"Heaven forbid!\" said Sanders piously, \"that I should do anything so  wicked.\"    The end of the story, so far as Miss Clinton Calbraith was concerned,  was that she went to Isisi, stayed three days, and came back  incoherent.    \"He is not a child!\" she said wildly; \"he is--a--a little devil!\"    \"So I should say,\" said Sanders philosophically.    \"A king? It is disgraceful! He lives in a mud hut and wears no clothes.  If I'd known!\"    \"A child of nature,\" said Sanders blandly. \"You didn't expect a sort of  Louis Quinze, did you?\"    \"I don't know what I expected,\" she said desperately; \"but it was  impossible to stay--quite impossible.\"    \"Obviously,\" murmured Sanders.    \"Of course, I knew he would be black,\" she went on; \"and I knew  that--oh, it was too horrid!\"    \"The fact of it is, my dear young lady,\" said Sanders, \"Peter wasn't as  picturesque as you imagined him; he wasn't the gentle child with  pleading eyes; and he lives messy--is that it?\"    This was not the only attempt ever made to educate Peter. Months  afterwards, when Miss Calbraith had gone home and was busily writing her  famous book, \"Alone in Africa: by an English Gentlewoman,\" Sanders heard  of another educative raid. Two members of an Ethiopian mission came into  Isisi by the back way. The Ethiopian mission is made up of Christian  black men, who, very properly, basing their creed upon Holy Writ, preach  the gospel of Equality. A black man is as good as a white man any day of  the week, and infinitely better on Sundays if he happens to be a member  of the Reformed Ethiopian Church.    They came to Isisi and achieved instant popularity, for the kind of talk  they provided was very much to the liking of Sato-Koto and the king's  councillors.    Sanders sent for the missioners. The first summons they refused to obey,  but they came on the second occasion, because the message Sanders sent  was at once peremptory and ominous.    They came to headquarters, two cultured American negroes of good address  and refined conversation. They spoke English faultlessly, and were in  every sense perfect gentlemen.    \"We cannot understand the character of your command,\" said one, \"which  savours somewhat of interference with the liberty of the subject.\"    \"You'll understand me better,\" said Sanders, who knew his men, \"when I  tell you that I cannot allow you to preach sedition to my people.\"    \"Sedition, Mr. Sanders!\" said the negro in shocked tones. \"That is a  grave charge.\"    Sanders took a paper from a pigeon-hole in his desk; the interview took  place in his office.    \"On such a date,\" he said, \"you said this, and this, and that.\"    In other words he accused them of overstepping the creed of Equality and  encroaching upon the borderland of political agitation.    \"Lies!\" said the elder of the two, without hesitation.    \"Truth or lies,\" he said, \"you go no more to Isisi.\"    \"Would you have the heathen remain in darkness?\" asked the man, in  reproach. \"Is the light we kindle too bright, master?\"    \"No,\" said Sanders, \"but a bit too warm.\"    So he committed the outrage of removing the Ethiopians from the scene of  their earnest labours, in consequence of which questions were asked in  Parliament.    Then the chief of the Akasava people--an old friend--took a hand in the  education of King Peter. Akasava adjoins that king's territory, and the  chief came to give hints in military affairs.    He came with drums a-beating, with presents of fish and bananas and  salt.    \"You are a great king!\" he said to the sleepy-eyed boy who sat on a  stool of state, regarding him with open-mouthed interest. \"When you walk  the world shakes at your tread; the mighty river that goes flowing down  to the big water parts asunder at your word, the trees of the forest  shiver, and the beasts go slinking to cover when your mightiness goes  abroad.\"    \"Oh, ko, ko!\" giggled the king, pleasantly tickled.    \"The white men fear you,\" continued the chief of the Akasava; \"they  tremble and hide at your roar.\"    Sato-Koto, standing at the king's elbow, was a practical man.    \"What seek ye, chief?\" he asked, cutting short the compliments.    So the chief told him of a land peopled by cowards, rich with the  treasures of the earth, goats, and women.    \"Why do you not take them yourself?\" demanded the regent.    \"Because I am a slave,\" said the chief; \"the slave of Sandi, who would  beat me. But you, lord, are of the great; being king's headman, Sandi  would not beat you because of your greatness.\"    There followed a palaver, which lasted two days.    \"I shall have to do something with Peter,\" wrote Sanders despairingly to  the Administrator; \"the little beggar has gone on the war-path against  those unfortunate Ochori. I should be glad if you would send me a  hundred men, a Maxim, and a bundle of rattan canes; I'm afraid I must  attend to Peter's education myself.\"           *     *     *     *     *    \"Lord, did I not speak the truth?\" said the Akasava chief in triumph.  \"Sandi has done nothing! Behold, we have wasted the city of the Ochori,  and taken their treasure, and the white man is dumb because of your  greatness! Let us wait till the moon comes again, and I will show you  another city.\"    \"You are a great man,\" bleated the king, \"and some day you shall build  your hut in the shadow of my palace.\"    \"On that day,\" said the chief, with splendid resignation, \"I shall die  of joy.\"    When the moon had waxed and waned and come again, a pencilled silver  hoop of light in the eastern sky, the Isisi warriors gathered with spear  and broad-bladed sword, with _ingola_ on their bodies, and clay in their  hair.    They danced a great dance by the light of a huge fire, and all the women  stood round, clapping their hands rhythmically.    In the midst of this there arrived a messenger in a canoe, who  prostrated himself before the king, saying:    \"Master, one day's march from here is Sandi; he has with him five score  of soldiers and the brass gun which says: 'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!'\"    A silence reigned in court circles, which was broken by the voice of the  Akasava chief.    \"I think I will go home,\" he said. \"I have a feeling of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#2)"],[1,"sayings.    Or, let us for a moment contemplate the events of later date; for  instance, the Mother Church against the reformers of various ages; see  them belied, slandered, degraded, whipped, stoned, imprisoned, burned,  and destroyed in various ways, while the ignorant multitude were made  to believe they were the very worst of men.    Again, think for a moment of the struggles of Columbus, an obscure  individual of limited education, but blessed with a largeness of  heart, a noble genius, a mind which disdained to confine itself to the  old beaten track; accustomed to think for itself, it burst the chains  which, in ages past, had held in bondage the nations of the earth; it  soared aloft, as it were on eagle's wings; it outstripped and left far  behind the boasted genius of Greece and Rome; it penetrated the dark  mysteries which lay concealed amid the western waters. Behold him  struggling for eight years against the learned ignorance of the courts  and councils of Europe, while the sneer of contempt, the finger of  scorn, and the hiss of derision, were the solid arguments opposed to  his theory.    But what was the result when, after many a fruitless struggle, an  expedition was fitted out, consisting of three small vessels? A new  world presented itself to the wondering nations of the East, destined,  at no distant period, to become the theatre of the most glorious and  astonishing events of the last days. This fact was no sooner  demonstrated than their philosophical, geographical, and religious  objections vanished in a moment; haughty ignorance and bigotry were  for once constrained to cast their honors in the dust, and bow their  reverend heads at the feet of real worth, and learn, in humble  silence, that one fact, clearly demonstrated, was worth ten thousand  theories and opinions of men.    Having said so much to impress upon the human mind the necessity of  hearing, and then judging, I would only add, that the object of this  publication is to give the public correct information concerning a  religious system, which has penetrated every State from Maine to  Missouri, as well as the Canadas, in the short space of nine years;  organizing Churches and Conferences in every region, and gathering in  its progress from fifty to a hundred thousand disciples; having, at  the same time, to sustain the shock of an overwhelming, religious  influence, opposed to it by the combined powers of every sect in  America. What but the arm of Omnipotence could have moved it forward  amid the rage of mobs? having to contend with the prejudice of the  ignorant and the pen of the learned; at war with every creed and craft  in Christendom; while the combined powers of earth and hell were  hurling a storm of persecution, unparalleled in the history of our  country.    This Work is also intended as a warning voice, or proclamation of  truth, to all people into whose hands it may fall, that they may  understand, and be prepared for the great day of the Lord. Opinion and  guesswork in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well  demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind. And as the Holy  Ghost can alone guide us into all truth, we pray God the Eternal  Father, in the name of Jesus Christ His Son, that the Spirit of Truth  may inspire our hearts in inditing this matter; that we may be able to  write the truth in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that it  may be the word of God, the everlasting Gospel, the power of God unto  salvation, to the Gentile first, and also to the Jew.          A VOICE OF WARNING  AND  INSTRUCTION TO ALL PEOPLE.      CHAPTER I.    ON PROPHECY ALREADY FULFILLED.          We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well      that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,      until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: knowing      this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private      interpretation; for the prophecy came not in old time by the will      of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the      Holy Ghost.--PETER.    In order to prove anything from Scripture, it is highly necessary in  the first place to lay down some certain, definite, infallible rule of  interpretation, without which the mind is lost in uncertainty and  doubt, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the  truth.    The neglect of such a rule has thrown mankind into the utmost  confusion and uncertainty in all their biblical researches. Indeed,  while mankind are left at liberty to transform, spiritualize, or give  any uncertain or private interpretation to the word of God, all is  uncertainty.    \"Whatsoever was written aforetime, was written for our profit and  learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures,  might have hope.\" Now, suppose a friend from a distance should write  us a letter, making certain promises to us on certain conditions,  which, if we obtained, would be greatly to our profit and advantage:  of course it might be said the letter was written for our profit and  learning, that through patience and comfort of the letter we might  have hope to obtain the things promised. Now if we clearly understood  the letter, and knew what to expect, then it would afford us comfort  and hope; whereas, if there was any doubt or uncertainty on our minds  in the understanding of the same, then could we derive no certain  comfort or hope from the things written, not knowing what to hope for;  consequently the letter would not profit us at all. And so it is with  the Scriptures. No prophecy or promise will profit the reader, or  produce patience, comfort, or hope in his mind until clearly  understood, that he may know precisely what to hope for. Now, the  predictions of the Prophets can be clearly understood, as much so as  the almanac when it foretells an eclipse; or else the Bible of all  books is of most doubtful usefulness. Far better would it have been  for mankind, if the great Author of our existence had revealed nothing  to His fallen creatures, than to have revealed a book which would  leave them in doubt and uncertainty, to contend with one another, from  age to age, respecting the meaning of its contents. That such  uncertainty and contention have existed for ages, none will deny. The  wise and learned have differed, and do still widely differ, from each  other, in the understanding of prophecy. Whence then this difference?  Either Revelation itself is deficient, or else the fault is in  mankind. But to say Revelation is deficient, would be to charge God  foolishly; God forbid: the fault must be in man. There are two great  causes for this blindness, which I will now show:    First, mankind have supposed that direct inspiration by the Holy Ghost  was not intended for all ages of the Church, but was confined to  primitive times; the \"Canon of Scripture being full,\" and all things  necessary being revealed; the Spirit which guides into all truth was  no longer for the people: therefore they sought to understand, by  their own wisdom, and by their own learning, what could never be  clearly understood, except by the Spirit of Truth: for the things of  God knoweth no man, except by the Spirit of God.    Secondly, having lost the Spirit of Inspiration, they began to  institute their own opinions, traditions, and commandments; giving  constructions and private interpretations to the written word, instead  of believing the things written. And the moment they departed from its  literal meaning, one man's opinion, or interpretation, was just as  good as another's; all were clothed with equal authority, and from  thence arose all the darkness and misunderstanding on these points,  which have agitated the world for the last seventeen hundred years.    Among the variety of commodities which attract the attention of  mankind, there is one thing of more value than all others. A principle  which, if once possessed, will greatly assist in obtaining all other  things worth possessing, whether it were power, wealth, riches,  honors, thrones, or dominions. Comparatively few have ever possessed  it, although it was within the reach of many others, but they were  either not aware of it, or did not know its value. It has worked  wonders for the few who have possessed it. Some it enabled to escape  from drowning, while every soul who did not possess it was lost in the  mighty deep. Others it saved from famine, while thousands perished all  around them; by it men have often been raised to dignity in the state;  yea, more, some have been raised to the throne of empires. The  possession of it has sometimes raised men from a dungeon to a palace;  and there are instances in which those that possessed it were  delivered from the flames, while cities were consumed, and every soul,  themselves excepted, perished. Frequently, when a famine or the sword  has destroyed a city or nation, they alone who possessed it escaped  unhurt. By this time the reader inquires, What can this be? Inform me,  and I will purchase it, even at the sacrifice of all I possess on  earth. Well, kind reader, this treasure is FOREKNOWLEDGE! a knowledge  of things future! Let a book be published, entitled, \"A Knowledge of  the Future,\" and let mankind be really convinced that it did give a  certain, definite knowledge of future events, so that its pages unfold  the future history of the nations, and of many great events, as the  history of Greece or Rome does unfold the past, and a large edition  would immediately sell at a great sum per copy; indeed, they would be  above all price. Now, kind reader, the books of the Prophets, and the  Spirit of Prophecy were intended for this very purpose. Well did the  Apostle say, \"Covet earnestly the best gifts; but rather that ye  prophesy.\"    Having said so much, we will now enter into the wide expanded field  which lies before us, and search out the treasures of wisdom and  knowledge"]]]
