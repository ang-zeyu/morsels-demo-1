They had the boomerang and the weet-weet, but not the bow;  the throwing stick, but not, of course, the sword; the message stick,  but no hieroglyphs; and their art was almost purely decorative, in  geometrical patterns, not representative. They deemed themselves akin  to all nature, and called cousins with rain and smoke, with clouds and  sky, as well as with beasts and trees. They were adroit hunters,  skilled trackers, born sportsmen; they now ride well, and, for savages,  play cricket fairly. But, being invaded by the practical emigrant or  the careless convict, the natives were not studied when in their prime,  and science began to examine them almost too late. We have the works of  Sir George Grey, the too brief pamphlet of Mr. Gideon Lang, the more  learned labours of Messrs. Fison and Howitt, and the collections of Mr.  Brough Smyth. The mysteries (Bora) of the natives, the initiatory  rites, a little of the magic, a great deal of the social customs are  known to us, and we have fragments of the myths. But, till Mrs. Langloh  Parker wrote this book, we had but few of the stories which Australian  natives tell by the camp-fire or in the gum-tree shade.    These, for the most part, are KINDER MARCHEN, though they include many  aetiological myths, explanatory of the markings and habits of animals,  the origin of constellations, and so forth. They are a savage edition  of the METAMORPHOSES, and few unbiased students now doubt that the  METAMORPHOSES are a very late and very artificial version of  traditional tales as savage in origin as those of the Noongahburrah. I  have read Mrs. Parker's collection with very great interest, with  \"human pleasure,\" merely for the story's sake. Children will find here  the Jungle Book, never before printed, of black little boys and girls.  The sympathy with, and knowledge of beast-life and bird-life are worthy  of Mr. Kipling, and the grotesque names are just what children like.  Dinewan and Goomblegubbon should take their place with Rikki Tikki and  Mr. Kipling's other delightful creatures. But there is here no Mowgli,  set apart in the jungle as a man. Man, bird, and beast are all blended  in the Australian fancy as in that of Bushmen and Red Indians. All are  of one kindred, all shade into each other; all obey the Bush Law as  they obey the Jungle Law in Mr. Kipling's fascinating stories. This  confusion, of course, is not peculiar to Australian MARCHEN; it is the  prevalent feature of our own popular tales. But the Australians \"do it  more natural:\" the stories are not the heritage of a traditional and  dead, but the flowers of a living and actual condition of the mind. The  stories have not the ingenious dramatic turns of our own MARCHEN. Where  there are no distinctions of wealth and rank, there can be no  CINDERELLA and no PUSS IN BOOTS. Many stories are rude aetiological  myths; they explain the habits and characteristics of the birds and  beasts, and account in a familiar way for the origin of death (\"Bahloo,  the Moon, and the Daens\"). The origin of fire is also accounted for in  what may almost be called a scientific way. Once discovered, it is, of  course, stolen from the original proprietors. A savage cannot believe  that the first owners of fire would give the secret away. The inventors  of the myth of Prometheus were of the same mind.    On the whole the stories, perhaps, most resemble those from the Zulu in  character, though these represent a much higher grade of civilisation.  The struggle for food and water, desperately absorbing, is the  perpetual theme, and no wonder, for the narrators dwell in a dry and  thirsty land, and till not, nor sow, nor keep any domestic animals. We  see the cunning of the savage in the devices for hunting, especially  for chasing honey bees. The Rain-magic, actually practised, is of  curious interest. In brief, we have pictures of savage life by savages,  romances which are truly realistic. We understand that condition which  Dr. Johnson did not think happy--the state from which we came, and to  which we shall probably return. \"Equality,\" \"Liberty\", \"Community of  Goods,\" all mean savagery, and even savages, if equal, are not really  free. Custom is the tyrant.    The designs are from the sketch-book of an untaught Australian native;  they were given to me some years ago by my brother, Dr. Lang, of  Corowa. The artist has a good deal of spirit in his hunting scenes; his  trees are not ill done, his emus and kangaroos are better than his men  and labras. Using ink, a pointed stick, and paper, the artist shows an  unwonted freedom of execution. Nothing like this occurs in Australian  scratches with a sharp stone on hard wood. Probably no other member of  his dying race ever illustrated a book.    ANDREW LANG.      * * * * *          1.  DINEWAN THE EMU, AND GOOMBLEGUBBON THE BUSTARD      Dinewan the emu, being the largest bird, was acknowledged as king by the  other birds. The Goomblegubbons, the bustards, were jealous of the  Dinewans. Particularly was Goomblegubbon, the mother, jealous of the  Diriewan mother. She would watch with envy the high flight of the  Dinewans, and their swift running. And she always fancied that the  Dinewan mother flaunted her superiority in her face, for whenever  Dinewan alighted near Goomblegubbon, after a long, high flight, she  would flap her big wings and begin booing in her pride, not the loud  booing of the male bird, but a little, triumphant, satisfied booing  noise of her own, which never failed to irritate Goomblegubbon when she  heard it.    Goomblegubbon used to wonder how she could put an end to Dinewan's  supremacy. She decided that she would only be able to do so by injuring  her wings and checking her power of flight. But the question that  troubled her was how to effect this end. She knew she would gain  nothing by having a quarrel with Dinewan and fighting her, for no  Goomblegubbon would stand any chance against a Dinewan, There was  evidently nothing to be gained by an open fight. She would have to  effect her end by cunning.    One day, when Goomblegubbon saw in the distance Dinewan coming towards  her, she squatted down and doubled in her wings in such a way as to  look as if she had none. After Dinewan had been talking to her for some  time, Goomblegubbon said: \"Why do you not imitate me and do without  wings? Every bird flies. The Dinewans, to be the king of birds, should  do without wings. When all the birds see that I can do without wings,  they will think I am the cleverest bird and they will make a  Goomblegubbon king.\"    \"But you have wings,\" said Dinewan.    \"No, I have no wings.\" And indeed she looked as if her words were true,  so well were her wings hidden, as she squatted in the grass. Dinewan  went away after awhile, and thought much of what she had heard. She  talked it all over with her mate, who was as disturbed as she was. They  made up their minds that it would never do to let the Goomblegubbons  reign in their stead, even if they had to lose their wings to save  their kingship.    At length they decided on the sacrifice of their wings. The Dinewan  mother showed the example by persuading her mate to cut off hers with a  combo or stone tomahawk, and then she did the same to his. As soon as  the operations were over, the Dinewan mother lost no time in letting  Goomblegubbon know what they had done. She ran swiftly down to the  plain on which she had left Goomblegubbon, and, finding her still  squatting there, she said: \"See, I have followed your example. I have  now no wings. They are cut off.\"    \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Goomblegubbon, jumping up and dancing round with  joy at the success of her plot. As she danced round, she spread out her  wings, flapped them, and said: \"I have taken you in, old stumpy wings.  I have my wings yet. You are fine birds, you Dinewans, to be chosen  kings, when you are so easily taken in. Ha! ha! ha!\" And, laughing  derisively, Goomblegubbon flapped her wings right in front of Dinewan,  who rushed towards her to chastise her treachery. But Goomblegubbon  flew away, and, alas! the now wingless Dinewan could not follow her.    Brooding over her wrongs, Dinewan walked away, vowing she would be  revenged. But how? That was the question which she and her mate failed  to answer for some time. At length the Dinewan mother thought of a plan  and prepared at once to execute it. She hid all her young Dinewans but  two, under a big salt bush. Then she walked off to Goomblegubbons'  plain with the two young ones following her. As she walked off the  morilla ridge, where her home was, on to the plain, she saw  Goomblegubbon out feeding with her twelve young ones.    After exchanging a few remarks in a friendly manner with Goomblegubbon,  she said to her, \"Why do you not imitate me and only have two children?  Twelve are too many to feed. If you keep so many they will never grow  big birds like the Dinewans. The food that would make big birds of two  would only starve twelve.\" Goomblegubbon said nothing, but she thought  it might be so. It was impossible to deny that the young Dinewans were  much bigger than the young Goomblegubbons, and, discontentedly,  Goomblegubbon walked away, wondering whether the smallness of her young  ones was owing to the number of them being so much greater than that of  the Dinewans. It would be grand, she thought, to grow as big as the  Dinewans. But she remembered the trick she had played on Dinewan, and  she thought that perhaps she was being fooled in her turn. She looked  back to where the Dinewans fed, and as she saw how much bigger the two  young ones were than any of hers, once more mad envy of Dinewan  possessed her. She determined she would not be outdone. Rather would  she kill all her young ones but two. She said, \"The Dinewans shall not  be the king birds of the plains. The Goomblegubbons shall replace them.  They shall grow as big as the Dinewans, and shall keep their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#2)"],[1," of  undue crowding are listed in Italic type.    To persons in charge of the collections listed above I am deeply  indebted. Without their generous cooperation in allowing me to examine  specimens in their care this study would not have been possible.  Appreciated suggestions in the course of the work have been received  from Professors Rollin H. Baker, A. Byron Leonard, R. C. Moore, Robert  W. Wilson, and H. B. Tordoff, and many of my fellow students. Mr.  Victor Hogg gave helpful suggestions on the preparation of the  illustrations. My wife, Muriel Findley, devoted many hours to  secretarial work and typing of manuscript. Finally I am grateful to  Professor E. Raymond Hall for guidance in the study and for assistance  in preparing the manuscript. During the course of the study I received  support from the University of Kansas Endowment Association, from the  Office of Naval Research, and from the National Science Foundation.          NON-GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION      Non-geographic variation, that is to say, variation within a single  population of shrews, consists of variation owing to age and normal  individual variation. In _Sorex_ I have detected no significant  secondary sexual differences between males and females; accordingly  the two sexes are here considered together.    Variation with age must be considered in order to assemble comparable  samples of these shrews. Increased age results in wear on all teeth  and in particularly striking changes in the size and shape of the  first incisors. Skulls of older shrews develop sagittal and lambdoidal  ridges, and further differ from skulls of young animals in being  slightly broader and shorter, and in developing thicker bone,  particularly on the rostrum which thus seems to be, but is not always  in fact, more robust. Pruitt has recently (1954) noted these same  cranial differences in specimens of _Sorex cinereus_ of different  ages.    Several students of American shrews, notably Pearson (1945) on  _Blarina_, Hamilton (1940) on _Sorex fumeus_, and Conaway (1952) on  _Sorex palustris_, have shown that young are born in spring and  summer, usually reach sexual maturity the following spring, and rarely  survive through, or even to, a second winter. The result is that  collections made, as most of them are, in spring and summer, contain  two age classes, first year and second year animals. These two age  classes are readily separable on the basis of differences in the skull  as well as on the decreased pubescence of the tail and the increased  weight of second year animals. My own examination of hundreds of  museum specimens confirms this for the _Sorex vagrans_ group.  Separation of the two age classes in an August-taken series of _Sorex  vagrans_ from coastal Washington is shown in figure 3, in which two  tooth-measurements that are dependent upon wear are plotted against  one another.    First year animals are more abundant in collections than are second  year animals. Within the first year, that is to say from spring to  late fall, animals vary but little. Dental characters are best studied  in first year shews. For this reason I have used them as the basis for  the study of geographic variation, and descriptions are based on first  year animals unless otherwise noted.          CHARACTERS OF TAXONOMIC WORTH      Within the _Sorex vagrans_ complex, the only characters of taxonomic  significance that I have detected are in size and color. It is true  that cranial proportions, such as relative size of rostrum, may change  from population to population, but these proportions seem to me to be  dependent upon actual size of the individual shrew as I shall  elsewhere point out. Of the cranial measurements here employed,  palatal length and least interorbital breadth are the most significant  and useful. Color in the _S. vagrans_ group seems to be in Orange and  Cadmium Yellow, colors 15 and 17 of Ridgway (1912). No specimens  actually possess these pure colors, but most colors in these shrews  are seen to be derived from the two mentioned by admixture of black  and/or neutral gray. In color designations an increase in neutral gray  is indicated by an increased number of prime signs ('), whereas  increase in black is indicated by progressive characters of the Roman  alphabet (_i_, _k_, _m_). Thus, 17''_k_ is grayer than 17'_k_ and  17''_m_ is blacker than 17''_k_. In subspecific diagnoses in this  report, color and size, and sometimes relative size, are the  characters usually mentioned.       [Illustration: FIG. 3. Two measurements (in millimeters)        reflecting tooth-wear plotted against one another. First year        and second year individuals of _Sorex vagrans vagrans_, all        taken in August at Willapa Bay, Washington, are completely        separated. Open circles represent teeth of second year shrews;        solid circles represent teeth of first year shrews.]          PELAGE CHANGE      In general, winter pelage is darker than summer pelage in these  shrews. Winter pelage comes in first on the rump and spreads caudad  and ventrad. The growth line of incoming hair is easily detected on  the fur side of the skin. Throughout the winter the color of the  pelage changes, often becoming somewhat browner, although no actual  molt takes place. This was noted by Dalquest (1944) who assumed that  the color change resulted from molt although he was unable to detect  actual replacement of hairs. Summer pelage usually comes in first on  the back or head and moves posteriorly and laterally. Time of molt  depends on latitude and altitude. Summer pelage may appear fairly late  in the season and may account for the anomalous midsummer molt noted  by Dalquest. Fresh pelages of summer and winter are best seen in first  year animals and are less variable than are worn pelages and hence are  used as the basis of color descriptions.          GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION      Pacific Coastal Section    The largest shrews of the _vagrans_ group (large in all dimensions)  occur in the coastal forests of northern California and of Oregon.  Those shrews are reddish, large-skulled, large-toothed, and have  rostra that are large in proportion to the size of the skull as a  whole. The very largest of these shrews live along the coast of  northwestern California. To the southward they are somewhat smaller,  and at successively more northern localities, to as far as  southwestern British Columbia, they are likewise progressively smaller  and also somewhat less reddish. The relative size of the rostrum  decreases with the decrease in size of the skull; consequently smaller  shrews have relatively smaller rostra (see fig. 4). In addition the  zygomatic ridge of the squamosal decreases in relative size with  decrease in actual size of the skull. Thus, these features change in a  clinal fashion as one proceeds from, say, Humboldt County, California,  northward to Astoria, Oregon.    Turning our attention now farther inland to the Cascade Mountains of  northern Oregon, the shrews there also are smaller and less reddish  (more brownish) than in northwestern California, and the trend to  smaller and darker shrews culminates in the northern Cascades of  Washington. Shrews from there, and from the southwestern coast of  British Columbia, compared with those from northwestern California,  are much smaller and have so great a suffusion of black that they  appear brown rather than red. At places along the coast successively  farther north of southwestern British Columbia the shrews become  larger again, the largest individuals being those from near Wrangell,  Alaska. From that place northwesterly along the coast of Alaska, size  decreases again.       [Illustration: FIG. 4. Condylobasal length (in millimeters)        plotted against palatal index (palatal length/condylobasal        length x 100) in several subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ to show        relative increase in size of rostrum with actual increase in        size of skull.]    The shrews so far discussed inhabit forests in a region of high  rainfall and a minimum of seasonal fluctuation in temperature. Such a  habitat seems to be the optimum for shrews of the _vagrans_ group  since the largest individuals are found there. In addition, shrews  seem to be as common, or commoner, in this coastal belt, than they are  in other places.    The large shrews of the _vagrans_ group on the Pacific coast were  divided into three species by H. H. T. Jackson in his revision of the  North American _Sorex_ in 1928. The large reddish shrews of the coast  of California and southern Oregon were called _S. pacificus_. The  somewhat smaller ones from the coast of central Oregon were called _S.  yaquinae_. Still smaller shrews from northwestern Oregon and from the  rest of the Pacific coast north into Alaska were called _S. obscurus_.  I find these kinds to intergrade continuously one with the next in the  manner described and conclude that all are of a single species.      Inland Montane Section    Inland from the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska the size of the  _vagrans_ shrew decreases rapidly. Specimens from western Alaska,  central Alaska, and the interior of British Columbia are uniformly  smaller than coastal specimens. In addition the red of the hair is  masked more by neutral gray than by black with the result that the  pelage is grayish rather than brownish or reddish. Shrews of this  general appearance are found southward through the Rocky Mountain  chain to Colorado and New Mexico. On the more or less isolated  mountain ranges of Montana east of the continental divide the  _vagrans_ shrew is somewhat smaller still. On the Sacramento Mountains  of southeastern New Mexico the shrew is somewhat larger and slightly  darker. Southwestward from the Colorado Rockies this shrew becomes  smaller and slightly more reddish (less grayish).    All of these montane populations of the _vagrans_ shrew are commonest  in hydrosere communities,"]]]
