Dante is himself the hero of the _Divine Comedy_, and ere many stages of  the _Inferno_ have been passed the reader feels that all his steps are  being taken in a familiar companionship. When every allowance has been  made for what the exigencies of art required him to heighten or  suppress, it is still impossible not to be convinced that the author is  revealing himself much as he really was--in some of his weakness as well  as in all his strength. The poem itself, by many an unconscious touch,  does for his moral portraiture what the pencil of Giotto has done for  the features of his face. The one likeness answers marvellously to the  other; and, together, they have helped the world to recognise in him the  great example of a man of genius who, though at first sight he may seem  to be austere, is soon found to attract our love by the depth of his  feelings as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of his fancy,  and by the clearness of his judgment on everything concerned with the  lives and destiny of men. His other writings in greater or less degree  confirm the impression of Dante's character to be obtained from the  _Comedy_. Some of them are partly autobiographical; and, studying as a  whole all that is left to us of him, we can gain a general notion of  the nature of his career--when he was born and what was his condition in  life; his early loves and friendships; his studies, military service,  and political aims; his hopes and illusions, and the weary purgatory of  his exile.    To the knowledge of Dante's life and character which is thus to be  acquired, the formal biographies of him have but little to add that is  both trustworthy and of value. Something of course there is in the  traditional story of his life that has come down from his time with the  seal of genuineness; and something that has been ascertained by careful  research among Florentine and other documents. But when all that old and  modern _Lives_ have to tell us has been sifted, the additional facts  regarding him are found to be but few; such at least as are beyond  dispute. Boccaccio, his earliest biographer, swells out his _Life_, as  the earlier commentators on the _Comedy_ do their notes, with what are  plainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied by Dante's own  words; while more recent and critical writers succeed with infinite  pains in little beyond establishing, each to his own satisfaction, what  was the order of publication of the poet's works, where he may have  travelled to, and when and for how long a time he may have had this or  that great lord for a patron.    A very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the events of Dante's  life as far as they are certainly known. But, to be of use as an  introduction to the study of his great poem, any biographical sketch  must contain some account--more or less full--of Florentine affairs  before and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these are to be  found many of the persons of the _Comedy_. In reading the poem we are  never suffered for long to forget his exile. From one point of view it  is an appeal to future ages from Florentine injustice and ingratitude;  from another, it is a long and passionate plea with his native town to  shake her in her stubborn cruelty. In spite of the worst she can do  against him he remains no less her son. In the early copies of it, the  _Comedy_ is well described as the work of Dante Alighieri, the  Florentine; since not only does he people the other world by preference  with Florentines, but it is to Florence that, even when his words are  bitter against her, his heart is always feeling back. Among the glories  of Paradise he loves to let his memory rest on the church in which he  was baptized and the streets he used to tread. He takes pleasure in her  stones; and with her towers and palaces Florence stands for the  unchanging background to the changing scenes of his mystical pilgrimage.    The history of Florence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  agrees in general outline with that of most of its neighbours. At the  beginning of the period it was a place of but little importance, ranking  far below Pisa both in wealth and political influence. Though retaining  the names and forms of municipal government, inherited from early times,  it was in reality possessed of no effective control over its own  affairs, and was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely as  was ever any German village planted in the shadow of a castle. To  Florence, as to many a city of Northern and Central Italy, the first  opportunity of winning freedom came with the contest between Emperor  and Pope in the time of Hildebrand. In this quarrel the Church found its  best ally in Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. She, to secure the goodwill  of her subjects as against the Emperor, yielded first one and then  another of her rights in Florence, generally by way of a pious gift--an  endowment for a religious house or an increase of jurisdiction to the  bishop--these concessions, however veiled, being in effect so many  additions to the resources and liberties of the townsmen. She made Rome  her heir, and then Florence was able to play off the Papal against the  Imperial claims, yielding a kind of barren homage to both Emperor and  Pope, and only studious to complete a virtual independence of both.  Florence had been Matilda's favourite place of residence; and,  benefiting largely as it did by her easy rule, it is no wonder that her  name should have been cherished by the Florentines for ages after as a  household word.[1] Nor is the greatest Florentine unmindful of her. Foe  of the Empire though she was, he only remembers her piety; and it is by  Matilda, as representing the active religious life, that Dante is  ushered into the presence of Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.[2]    It was a true instinct which led Florence and other cities to side  rather with the Pope than with the Emperor in the long-continued  struggle between them for predominance in Italy. With the Pope for  overlord they would at least have a master who was an Italian, and one  who, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest be led to  treat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent triumph of the  Emperor, Italy must have become subject and tributary to Germany, and  would have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for members  of the German garrison. The danger was brought home to many of the  youthful commonwealths during the eventful reign of Frederick Barbarossa  (1152-1190). Strong in Germany beyond most of his predecessors, that  monarch ascended the throne with high prerogative views, in which he was  confirmed by the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians.  According to these there could be only one master in the world; as far  as regarded the things of time, but one source of authority in  Christendom. They maintained everything to be the Emperor's that he  chose to take. When he descended into Italy to enforce his claims, the  cities of the Lombard League met him in open battle. Those of Tuscany,  and especially Florence, bent before the blast, temporising as long as  they were able, and making the best terms they could when the choice lay  between submission and open revolt. Even Florence, it is true, strong in  her allies, did once take arms against an Imperial lieutenant; but as a  rule she never refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in fact  beyond what could not be helped. In her pursuit of advantages,  skilfully using every opportunity, and steadfast of aim even when most  she appeared to waver, she displayed something of the same address that  was long to be noted as a trait in the character of the individual  Florentine.    The storm was weathered, although not wholly without loss. When, towards  the close of his life, and after he had broken his strength against the  obstinate patriotism of Lombardy, Frederick visited Florence in 1185, it  was as a master justly displeased with servants who, while they had not  openly rebelled against him, had yet proved eminently unprofitable, and  whom he was concerned to punish if not to destroy. On the complaint of  the neighbouring nobles, that they were oppressed and had been plundered  by the city, he gave orders"]]]
