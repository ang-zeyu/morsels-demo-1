None appreciated the humor of this fact more than Steele himself, and he  fell again into his wholesome laugh as he placed a fresh pine log on the  fire, wondering what his aristocratic friends--and especially the  girl of the hyacinth letter--would say if they could see him and his  environment just at the present moment. In a slow, chuckling survey he  took in the heavy German socks which he had hung to dry close to the  fire; his worn shoe-packs, shining in a thick coat of caribou grease,  and his single suit of steaming underwear that he had washed after  supper, and which hung suspended from the ceiling, looking for all the  world, in the half dusk of the cabin, like a very thin and headless man.  In this gloom, indeed, but one thing shone out white and distinct--the  skull on the little shelf above the fire. As his eyes rested on it,  Steele's lips tightened and his face grew dark. With a sudden movement  he reached up and took it in his hands, holding it for a moment so that  the light from the fire flashed full upon it. In the left side, on a  line with the eyeless socket and above the ear, was a hole as large as a  small egg.    \"So I'm ordered up to join Nome, the man who did this, eh?\" he muttered,  fingering the ragged edge. \"I could kill him for what happened down  there at Nelson House, M'sieur Janette. Some day--I may.\"    He balanced the skull on his finger tips, level with his chin.    \"Nice sort of a chap for a Hamlet, I am,\" he went on, whimsically. \"I  believe I'll chuck you into the fire, M'sieur Janette. You're getting on  my nerves.\"    He stopped suddenly and lowered the skull to the table.    \"No, I won't burn you,\" he continued, \"I've brought you this far and  I'll pack you up to Lac Bain with me. Some morning I'll give you to  Bucky Nome for breakfast. And then, M'sieur--then we shall see what we  shall see.\"    Later that night he wrote a few words on a slip of paper and tacked  the paper to the inside of his door. To any who might follow in his  footsteps it conveyed this information and advice:    NOTICE!    This cabin and what's in it are quasheed by me. Fill your gizzard but  not your pockets.    Steele, Northwest Mounted.        Chapter II. A Face Out Of The Night    Steele came up to the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Lac Bain on the  seventh day after the big storm, and Breed, the factor, confided two  important bits of information to him while he was thawing out before the  big box-stove in the company's deserted and supply-stripped store.  The first was that a certain Colonel Becker and his wife had left Fort  Churchill, on Hudson's Bay, to make a visit at Lac Bain; the second,  that Buck Nome had gone westward a week before and had not returned.  Breed was worried, not over Nome's prolonged absence, but over the  anticipated arrival of the other two. According to the letter which had  come to him from the Churchill factor. Colonel Becker and his wife had  come over on the last supply ship from London, and the colonel was a  high official in the company's service. Also, he was an old gentleman.  Ostensibly he had no business at Lac Bain, but was merely on a vacation,  and wished to see a bit of real life in the wilderness.    Breed's grizzled face was miserable.    \"Why don't they send 'em down to York Factory or Nelson House?\" he  demanded of Steele. \"They've got duck feathers, three women, and a  civilized factor at the Nelson, and there ain't any of 'em here--not  even a woman!\"    Steele shrugged his shoulders as Breed mentioned the three women at  Nelson.    \"There are only two women there now,\" he replied. \"Since a certain Bucky  Nome passed that way, one of them has gone into the South.\"    \"Well, two, then,\" said Breed, who had not caught the flash of fire in  the other's eyes. \"But I tell you there ain't a one here, Steele, not  even an Indian--and that dirty Cree, Jack, is doing the cooking. Blessed  Saints, I caught him mixing biscuit dough in the wash basin the other  day, and I've been eating those biscuits ever since our people went  out to their traplines! There's you, and Nome, two Crees, a 'half'  and myself--and that's every soul there'll be at Lac Bain until the  mid-winter run of fur. Now, what in Heaven's name is the poor old Mrs.  Colonel going to do?\"    \"Got a bed for her?\"    \"A bunk--hard as nails!\"    \"Good grub?\"    \"Rotten!\" groaned the factor. \"Every trapper's son of them took out big  supplies this fall and we're stripped. Beans, flour, sugar'n'prunes--and  caribou until I feel like turning inside out every time I smell it. I'd  give a month's commission for a pound of pork. Look here! If this letter  ain't 'quality' you can cut me into jiggers. Bet the Mrs. Colonel wrote  it for her hubby.\"    From an inside pocket Breed drew forth a square white envelope with  a broken seal of red wax, and from it extracted a folded sheet of  cream-tinted paper. Scarcely had Steele taken the note in his hands when  a quick thrill passed through him. Before he had read the first line  he was conscious again of that haunting sweetness in the air he  breathed--the perfume of hyacinth. There was not only this perfume, but  the same paper, the same delicately pretty writing of the letter he  had burned more than a week before. He made no effort to suppress the  exclamation of astonishment that broke from his lips. Breed was staring  at him when he lifted his eyes.    \"This is a mighty strange coincidence, Breed,\" he said, regaining his  composure. \"I could almost swear that I know this writing, and yet of  course such a thing is impossible. Still, it's mighty queer. Will you  let me keep the letter until to-night? I'd like to take it over to the  cabin and compare it--\"    \"Needn't return it at all,\" interrupted the factor. \"Hope you find  something interesting to tell me at supper--five sharp. It will be a  blessing if you know 'em.\"    Ten minutes later Steele was in the little cabin which he and Nome  occupied while at Lac Bain. Jack, the Cree, had built a rousing fire in  the long sheet-iron stove, and as Steele opened its furnace-like door,  a flood of light poured out into the gathering gloom of early evening.  Drawing a chair full into the light, he again opened the letter. Line  for line and word for word he scrutinized the writing, and with each  breath that he drew he found himself more deeply thrilled by a curious  mental excitement which it was impossible for him to explain. According  to the letter. Colonel and Mrs. Becker had arrived at Churchill aboard  the London ship a little over a month previously. He remembered that the  date on the letter from the girl was six weeks old. At the time it was  written, Colonel Becker and his wife were either in London or Liverpool,  or crossing the Atlantic. No matter how similar the two letters appeared  to him, he realized that, under the circumstances, the same person could  not have written them both. For many minutes he sat back in his chair,  with his eyes half-closed, absorbing the comforting heat of the fire.  Again the old vision returned to him. In a subconscious sort of way he  found himself fighting against it, as he had struggled a score of times  to throw off its presence, since the girl's letter had come to him.  And this time, as before, his effort was futile. He saw her again--and  always as on that night of the Hawkins' ball, eyes and lips smiling at  him, the light shining gloriously in the deep red gold of her hair.    With an effort Steele aroused himself and looked at his watch. It was  a quarter of five. He stooped to close the stove door, and stopped  suddenly, his hand reaching out, head and shoulders hunched over. Across  his knee, shining in the firelight, like a thread of spun gold, lay a  single filament of a woman's hair.    He rose slowly, holding the hair between him and the light. His fingers  trembled, his breath came quickly. The hair had fallen upon his knee  from the letter--or the envelope, and it was wonderfully like HER hair!    From the direction of the factor's quarters came the deep bellowing of  Breed's moose-horn, calling him to supper. Before he responded to it,  Steele wound the silken thread of gold about his ringer, then placed  it carefully among the papers and cards which he carried in his leather  wallet. His face was flushed when he joined the factor. Not since the  night at the Hawkins' ball, when he had felt the touch of a beautiful  woman's hands, the warmth of her breath, the soft sweep of her hair  against his lips as he had leaned over her in his half-surrender, had  thought of woman stirred him as he felt himself stirred now. He was  glad that Breed was too much absorbed in his own troubles to observe any  possible change in himself or to ask questions about the letter.    \"I tell you, it may mean the short birch for me, Steele,\" said  the factor gloomily. \"Lac Bain is just now the emptiest, most  fallen-to-pieces, unbusiness-like post between the Athabasca and the  Bay. We've had two bad seasons running, and everything has gone wrong.  Colonel Becker is a big one with the company. Ain't no doubt about that,  and ten to one he'll think it's a new man that's wanted here.\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Steele. A sudden flash shot into his face as he  looked hard at Breed. \"See here, how would you like to have me go out to  meet them?\" he asked. \"Sort of a welcoming committee of one, you know.  Before they got here I could casually give 'em to understand what Lac  Bain has been up against during the last two seasons.\"    Breed's face brightened in an instant.    \"That might save us, Steele. Will you do it?\"    \"With pleasure.\"    Philip was conscious of an increasing warmth in his face as he bent over  his plate. \"You're sure--they're elderly people?\" he asked.    \"That is what MacVeigh wrote me from Churchill; at least he said the  colonel was an old man.\"    \"And his wife?\"    \"Has got her"]]]
