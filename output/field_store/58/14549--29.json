He  had begun to fear that there was a fair chance of his having trouble  getting his fare out of a very evident lunatic.    Utterly forgetful of his appearance in his festal array, Hetherington  bustled into the station, and shortly found himself standing before the  sergeant behind the desk.    \"Well, Santa Claus,\" said the official, with an amused glance at the  intruder, \"what can I do for you to-night? There ain't many rooms with a  bath left.\"    Hetherington flushed. He had intended to greet the sergeant with his  most imposing manner, but this turkey-red abomination on his back had  thrust dignity out in the cold.    \"I have come, officer,\" he said, as impressively as he could under the  circumstances, \"to make some inquiries concerning a man who was brought  here about an hour ago--I fear in a state of intoxication.\"    \"We have known such things to happen here, Santa,\" said the officer,  suavely. \"In fact, this blotter here seems to indicate that one George  W. Hetherington, of 561 Fifth Avenue--\"    \"Who?\" roared Hetherington.    \"George W. Hetherington is the name on the blotter,\" said the sergeant;  \"entered first as a D. D., but on investigation found to be suffering  from--\"    \"But that's my name!\" cried Hetherington. \"You don't mean to tell me he  claimed to be George W. Hetherington?\"    \"No,\" said the sergeant. \"The poor devil didn't make any claims for  himself at all. We found that name on a card in his hat, and a letter  addressed to the same name in his overcoat pocket. Puttin' the two  together we thought it was a good enough identification.\"    \"Well, I'll have you to understand, sergeant--\" bristled Hetherington,  cockily.    \"None o' that, Santa Claus--none o' that!\" growled the sergeant, leaning  over the desk and eying him coldly. \"I don't know what game you're up  to, but just one more peep in that tone and there'll be two George W.  Hetheringtons in the cooler this night.\"    Hetherington almost tore the Santa Claus garb from his shoulders, and  revealed himself as a personage of fine raiment underneath, whatever he  might have appeared at a superficial glance. As he did so a crumpled  piece of paper fell to the floor from the pocket of the turkey-red coat.    \"I don't mean to do anything but what is right, sergeant,\" he said,  controlling his wrath, \"but what I do want is to impress it upon your  mind that _I_ am George W. Hetherington, and that having my name spread  on the blotter of a police court isn't going to do me any good. I  loaned that fellow my hat and coat to get a square meal, while I took  his place--\"    The officer grinned broadly, but with no assurance in his smile that he  believed.    \"Oh, you may not believe it,\" said Hetherington, \"but it's true, and if  this thing gets into the papers to-morrow morning--\"    \"Say, Larry,\" said the sergeant, addressing an officer off duty, \"did  the reporters copy that letter we found in Hetherington's pocket?\"    \"Reporters?\" gasped Hetherington. \"Good Lord, man--yuh-you don't  mum-mean to say yuh-you let the reporters--\"    \"No, chief,\" replied Larry. \"They ain't been in yet--I t'ink ye shoved  it inter yer desk.\"    \"So I did, so I did,\" grinned the sergeant. Here he opened the drawer in  front of him and extracted a pretty little blue envelope which  Hetherington immediately recognized as a particularly private and  confidential communication from--well, somebody. This is not a _cherchez  la femme_ story, so we will leave the lady's name out of it altogether.  It must be noted, however, that a sight of that dainty missive in the  great red fist of the sergeant gave Hetherington a heart action that  fifty packages of cigarettes a day could hardly inflict upon a less  healthy man.    \"That's the proof--\" cried Hetherington, excitedly. \"If that don't  prove it's my overcoat nothing will.\"    \"Right you are, Santa Claus,\" said the sergeant, opening the envelope  and taking out the delicately scented sheet of paper within. \"I'll give  you two guesses at the name signed to this, and if you get it right once  I'll give you the coat, and Mr. Hetherington Number One in our evening's  consignment of Hetheringtons gets re-christened.\"    \"'Anita'!\" growled Hetherington.    \"You win!\" said the sergeant, handing over the letter.    Hetherington drew a long sigh of relief.    \"I guess this is worth cigars for the house, sergeant,\" he said. \"I'll  send 'em round to-morrow--meanwhile, how about--how about the other?\"    \"He's gone to the hospital,\" said the sergeant, grimly. \"The doctor says  he wasn't drunk--just another case of freezing starvation.\"    \"Starvation? And I guyed him! Great God!\" muttered Hetherington to  himself.      III    \"Narrow escape, Mr. Hetherington,\" said the sergeant. \"Ought to be a  lesson to you sports. What was your game, anyhow?\"    \"Oh, it wasn't any game--\" began Hetherington.    \"Huh! Just a case of too much lunch, eh?\" said the officer. \"You'd had  as much too much as the other feller'd had too little--that it?\"    \"No,\" said Hetherington. \"Just a general lack of confidence in my  fellow-men, plus a cussed habit of butting into matters that aren't any  of my business; but I'm glad I butted in, just the same, if I can be of  any earthly use to that poor devil of a Santa Claus. Do you suppose  there's any way to find out who he is?\"    \"Well, we've made a good start, anyhow,\" said the sergeant. \"We've found  out who he isn't. When he comes to in the mornin', if he does, maybe  he'll be able to help us identify him.\"    \"To-morrow!\" murmured Hetherington. \"And who knows but he's got a family  waiting for him somewhere right now, and as badly off as he is.\"    \"Ye dropped this, sir,\" said Larry, the officer off duty. \"It come out  of the red coat--mebbe it'll help--\"    He handed Hetherington the crumpled piece of paper that had fallen to  the floor when he tore Santa Claus's cloak from his back. It was sadly  dirty, but on one side of it was a childish scrawl in pencil.  Hetherington ran over it rapidly, and gulped.    \"Read that, sergeant!\" he said, huskily.    The sergeant read the following:        \"DEAR SANDY CLORS:--my Popper says hell hand you this here leter      when he sees you to ast you not to fergit me and jimmy like you      did last yeer. you aint been to see me an jimmy since popper      lost his Jobb and he says its becoz you lost our adres so ime      ritin to tell you weve moved since you come the lass time and am      now livin now on the Topp flor of fore 69 varrick streete noo      york which youd ort not to find it hard to git down the chimbley      bein on the topp flor closte to the roofe so i thort ide rite      and tell you what me and jimmyd like to hav you bring us wenn      you come.

What time is it?\"    \"Seven-thirty,\" replied the sergeant.    \"Good!\" said Hetherington. \"Shops don't close till ten--I guess I've got  time. Good night--see you first thing in the morning. Come along,  chauffeur, I'll need you for some time yet.\"    \"Good night, Mr. Hetherington,\" said the sergeant. \"Where are you bound  in case I need you any time?\"    \"Me?\" said Hetherington with a grin, \"why, my address is 561 Fifth  Avenue, but just now I'm off to do my Christmas shopping early.\"    And resuming possession of his own hat and overcoat, and taking the  Santa Claus costume under his arm, Hetherington passed out, the  chauffeur following.    \"These New York sports is a queer bunch!\" said the sergeant as  Hetherington disappeared.      IV    At half-past nine down-town was pretty well deserted, which made it easy  for the chauffeur of a certain red taxi-cab to make fairly good time  down Broadway; and when at nine-forty-five the panting mechanism drew up  before the grim walls of a brick tenement, numbered 469 Varick Street,  the man on the box was commendably proud of his record.    \"That was goin' some, sir,\" he said, with a broad grin on his face. \"I  don't believe it's ever been done quicker outside o' the fire  department.\"    \"I don't believe it has, old man,\" said Hetherington as he alighted.  \"Now if you'll help me up-stairs with these packages and that basket  there, we'll bring this affair to a grand-stand finish.\"    The two men toiled slowly up the stairs, Hetherington puffing somewhat  with the long climb; and when finally they had reached the top floor he  arrayed himself in the once despised garb of Santa Claus again. Then he  knocked at the door. The answer was immediate. A white-faced woman  opened the door.    \"Jim!\" she cried. \"Is it you?\"    \"No, madam,\" replied"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#2)"],[1,"age, which shuns  prolixity in every study, and requires systematic arrangement, are  additional incentives to the task. It is true that very pleasing and  instructive biographical sketches of the most celebrated painters have  been published by M. d'Argenville, in France; and various epitomes have  since appeared, in which the style of painting alone is discussed.[4]  But without taking into account the corruptions of the names of our  countrymen in which their authors have indulged, or their omission of  celebrated Italians, while they record less eminent artists of other  countries, no work of this sort, and still less any dictionary, can  afford us a systematic history of painting: none of these exhibit those  pictures, if we may be allowed the expression, in which we may, at a  glance, trace the progress and series of events; none of them exhibit  the principal masters of the art in a sufficiently conspicuous point of  view, while inferior artists are reduced to their proper size and  station: far less can we discover in them those epochs and revolutions  of the art, which the judicious reader most anxiously desires to know,  as the source from which he may trace the causes that have contributed  to its revival or its decline; or from which he may be enabled to  recollect the series, and the arrangement of the facts narrated. The  history of painting has a strong analogy to literary, to civil, and to  sacred history; it too requires, from time to time, the aid of certain  beacons, some particular distinction in regard to places, times, or  events, that may serve to divide it into epochs, and mark its successive  stages. Deprive it of these, and it degenerates, like other history,  into a chaos of names more calculated to load the memory than to inform  the understanding.    To supply this hitherto neglected branch of Italian history, to  contribute to the advancement of the art, and to facilitate the study of  the different styles in painting, were the three objects I proposed to  myself when I began the work which I am now about to lay before the  indulgent reader. My intention was to form a compendious history of all  our schools, in two volumes; adopting, with little variation, Pliny's  division of the country into Upper and Lower Italy. It was my design to  comprehend in the first volume the schools of Lower Italy; because in it  the reviving arts came earlier to maturity; and in the second to include  the schools of Upper Italy, which were more tardy in attaining to  celebrity. The first part of my work appeared at Florence in 1792: the  second I was obliged to defer to another opportunity, and the succeeding  years have so shaken my constitution, that I have scarcely been able to  bring it to a conclusion, even with the assistance of many amanuenses  and correctors of the press.[5] One advantage, however, has been derived  from this delay; and that is, a knowledge of the opinion of the public,  a tribunal from which no writer can appeal; and I have been thus enabled  to prepare a new edition conformable to its decision.[6] I have  understood through various channels, that an additional number of names  and of notices were necessary to afford satisfaction to the public; and  this I have accomplished, without abandoning my plan of a compendious  history. Nor does the Florentine edition on this account become useless:  it will even be preferred by many to that published at Bassano; the  inhabitants, for instance, of Lower Italy will be pleased to possess a  work on their most illustrious painters, without concerning themselves  about accounts of other places.    To a new work, then, so much more extensive than the former, I prefix a  preface almost entirely new. The plan is not wholly my own, nor  altogether that of others. Richardson[7] suggested that some historian  should collect the scattered remarks on art, especially on painting, and  should point out its progress and decline through successive ages. He  has not even omitted to give us a sketch, which he brought down to the  time of Giordano. Mengs[8] accomplished the task more perfectly in the  form of a letter, where he judiciously distinguished all the periods of  the art, and has thus laid the foundations of a more enlarged history.  Were I to follow their example, the chief masters of every school would  be considered together, and we should be under the necessity of passing  from one country to another, according as painting acquired a new lustre  from their talents, or was debased by a wrong use of the great example  of those artists. This method might be easily pursued, if the subject  were to be treated in a general point of view, such as Pliny has  considered and transmitted it to posterity; but it is not equally  adapted to the arrangement of a history so fully particular as Italy  seems to require. Besides the styles introduced by the most celebrated  painters, such infinite diversities of a mixed character, often united  with originality of manner, have arisen in every school, that we cannot  easily reduce them to any particular standard: and the same artists at  different periods, and in different pictures, have adopted styles so  various, that at one time they appear imitators of Titian, at another of  Raffaello, or of Correggio. We cannot, therefore, adopt the method of  the naturalist, who having arranged the vegetable kingdom, for example,  in classes more or less numerous, according to the systems of Tournefort  or of Linnaeus, can easily reduce a plant, wherever it may happen to  grow, to a particular class, adding a name and description, at once  precise, characteristic, and permanent. In a complete history it is  necessary to distinguish each style from every other: nor do I know any  more eligible method of performing this task, than by composing a  separate history of each school. In this I follow Winckelmann, the best  historian of ancient art in design, who specified as many different  schools as the nations that produced them. A similar plan seems to me to  have been pursued by Rollin, in his History of Nations, who has thus  been enabled to record a prodigious mass of names and events within the  compass of a few volumes, in the clearest order.    The method I follow in treating of each school is analogous to that  prescribed to himself by Sig. Antonio Maria Zanetti,[9] in his _Pittura  Veneziana_, a work of its kind highly instructive, and well arranged.  What he has done, in speaking of his own, I have attempted in the other  schools of Italy. I accordingly omit the names of living painters, and  do not notice every picture of deceased artists, as it would interrupt  the connexion of the narrative, and would render the work too  voluminous, but content myself with commending some of their best  productions. I first give a general character of each school; I then  distinguish it into three, four, or more epochs, according as its style  underwent changes with the change of taste, in the same way that the  eras of civil history are deduced from revolutions in governments, or  other remarkable events. A few celebrated painters, who have swayed the  public taste, and given a new tone to the art, are placed at the head of  each epoch; and their style is particularly described, because the  general and characteristic taste of the age has been formed upon their  models. Their immediate pupils, and other disciples of the school,  follow their great masters; and without a repetition of the general  character, reference is made to what each has borrowed, altered, or  added to the style of the founder of the school, or at most such  character is cursorily noticed. This method, though not susceptible of a  strict chronological order, is, on account of the connexion of ideas,  much better adapted to a history of art than an alphabetic arrangement,  which too frequently interrupts the notices of schools and eras; or than  the method pursued in annals, by which we are often compelled to make  mention of the scholar before the master, should he survive the former;  or that of separate lives, which introduces much repetition, by obliging  the writer to bestow praises on the pupil for the same style which he  also commends in the master, and to notice in each individual that which  was the general character of the age in which he lived.    For the sake of perspicuity, I have generally separated from historical  painters artists in inferior branches, such as painters of portraits, of  landscape, of animals, of flowers and of fruit, of sea-pieces, of  perspectives, of drolls, and all who merit a place in such classes. I  have also taken notice of some arts which are analogous to painting, and  though they differ from it in the materials employed, or the manner of  using them, may still be included in the art; for example, engraving of  prints, inlaid and mosaic work, and embroidering tapestry. Vasari,  Lomazzo, and several other writers on the fine arts, have mentioned  them; and I have followed their example; contenting myself with  noticing, in each of those arts, only what has appeared most worthy of  being recorded. Each might be the subject of a separate work; and some  of them have long had their own peculiar historians, and in particular  the art of engraving. By this method, in which I may boast such great  examples, I am not without hopes of affording satisfaction to my  readers. I am, however, more apprehensive in regard to my selection of  artists; the number of whom, whatsoever method is adopted, may to some  appear by far too limited, and to others too greatly extended. But  criticism will not so readily apply to the names of the most illustrious  artists, whom I have included, nor to those of very inferior character,  whom I trust I have omitted; except a few that have some claim to be  mentioned, from their connexion with celebrated masters.[10] The  accusation then of having noticed some, and omitted others, will"]]]
