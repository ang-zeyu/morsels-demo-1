Ye fondle me now, but to strike me betimes.             (A treacherous lover, the sea!)            Once I saw as I lay, half-awash in the night            A hull in the gloom -- a quick hail -- and a light            And I lurched o'er to leeward and saved her for spite             From the doom that ye meted to me.              I was sister to 'Terrible', seventy-four,             (Yo ho! for the swing of the sea!)

To lie where the slow tide creeps hither and fro            And the shifting sand laps me around, for I know            That my gallant old crew are in Port long ago --             For ever at peace with the sea!          Quebec              1608-1908                Of old, like Helen, guerdon of the strong --             Like Helen fair, like Helen light of word, --            \"The spoils unto the conquerors belong.             Who winneth me must win me by the sword.\"              Grown old, like Helen, once the jealous prize             That strong men battled for in savage hate,            Can she look forth with unregretful eyes,             Where sleep Montcalm and Wolfe beside her gate?          Then and Now                  Beneath her window in the fragrant night             I half forget how truant years have flown            Since I looked up to see her chamber-light,             Or catch, perchance, her slender shadow thrown            Upon the casement; but the nodding leaves             Sweep lazily across the unlit pane,            And to and fro beneath the shadowy eaves,             Like restless birds, the breath of coming rain            Creeps, lilac-laden, up the village street             When all is still, as if the very trees            Were listening for the coming of her feet             That come no more; yet, lest I weep, the breeze            Sings some forgotten song of those old years            Until my heart grows far too glad for tears.          Unsolved                  Amid my books I lived the hurrying years,             Disdaining kinship with my fellow man;            Alike to me were human smiles and tears,             I cared not whither Earth's great life-stream ran,            Till as I knelt before my mouldered shrine,             God made me look into a woman's eyes;            And I, who thought all earthly wisdom mine,             Knew in a moment that the eternal skies            Were measured but in inches, to the quest             That lay before me in that mystic gaze.            \"Surely I have been errant:  it is best             That I should tread, with men their human ways.\"            God took the teacher, ere the task was learned,            And to my lonely books again I turned.          The Hope of My Heart              \"Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus,                    quoesumus ne memineris, Domine.\"                  I left, to earth, a little maiden fair,             With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;            I prayed that God might have her in His care                        And sight.              Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song;             (Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)            The path she showed was but the path of wrong                        And shame.              \"Cast her not out!\" I cry.  God's kind words come --             \"Her future is with Me, as was her past;            It shall be My good will to bring her home                        At last.\"          Penance                My lover died a century ago,            Her dear heart stricken by my sland'rous breath,            Wherefore the Gods forbade that I should know                        The peace of death.              Men pass my grave, and say, \"'Twere well to sleep,            Like such an one, amid the uncaring dead!\"            How should they know the vigils that I keep,                        The tears I shed?              Upon the grave, I count with lifeless breath,            Each night, each year, the flowers that bloom and die,            Deeming the leaves, that fall to dreamless death,                        More blest than I.              'Twas just last year -- I heard two lovers pass            So near, I caught the tender words he said:            To-night the rain-drenched breezes sway the grass                        Above his head.              That night full envious of his life was I,            That youth and love should stand at his behest;            To-night, I envy him, that he should lie                        At utter rest.          Slumber Songs                  I              Sleep, little eyes            That brim with childish tears amid thy play,            Be comforted!  No grief of night can weigh            Against the joys that throng thy coming day.              Sleep, little heart!            There is no place in Slumberland for tears:            Life soon enough will bring its chilling fears            And sorrows that will dim the after years.            Sleep, little heart!                  II              Ah, little eyes            Dead blossoms of a springtime long ago,            That life's storm crushed and left to lie below            The benediction of the falling snow!              Sleep, little heart            That ceased so long ago its frantic beat!            The years that come and go with silent feet            Have naught to tell save this -- that rest is sweet.            Dear little heart.

And he said to a lad,                 Carry him to his mother.  And . . . he sat on her knees till noon,                 and then died.  And she went up, and laid him on the bed. . . .                 And shut the door upon him and went out.\"_                  Immortal story that no mother's heart             Ev'n yet can read, nor feel the biting pain            That rent her soul!  Immortal not by art             Which makes a long past sorrow sting again              Like grief of yesterday:  but since it said             In simplest word the truth which all may see,            Where any mother sobs above her dead             And plays anew the silent tragedy.          Recompense                  I saw two sowers in Life's field at morn,             To whom came one in angel guise and said,            \"Is it for labour that a man is born?             Lo:  I am Ease.  Come ye and eat my bread!\"            Then gladly one forsook his task undone             And with the Tempter went his slothful way,            The other toiled until the setting sun             With stealing shadows blurred the dusty day.              Ere harvest time, upon earth's peaceful breast             Each laid him down among the unreaping dead.            \"Labour hath other recompense than rest,             Else were the toiler like the fool,\" I said;            \"God meteth him not less, but rather more            Because he sowed and others reaped his store.\"          Mine Host                  There stands a hostel by a travelled way;             Life is the road and Death the worthy host;            Each guest he greets, nor ever lacks to say,             \"How have ye fared?\"  They answer him, the most,            \"This lodging place is other than we sought;             We had intended farther, but the gloom            Came on apace, and found us ere we thought:             Yet will we lodge.  Thou hast abundant room.\"              Within sit haggard men that speak no word,             No fire gleams their cheerful welcome shed;            No voice of fellowship or strife is heard             But silence of a multitude of dead.            \"Naught can I offer ye,\" quoth Death, \"but rest!\"            And to his chamber leads each tired guest.          Equality                  I saw a King, who spent his life to weave             Into a nation all his great heart thought,            Unsatisfied until he should achieve             The grand ideal that his manhood sought;            Yet as he saw the end within his reach,             Death took the sceptre from his failing hand,            And all men said, \"He gave his life to teach             The task of honour to a sordid land!\"            Within his gates I saw, through all those years,             One at his humble toil with cheery face,            Whom (being dead) the children, half in tears,             Remembered oft, and missed him from his place.            If he be greater that his people blessed            Than he the children loved, God knoweth best.

He was meanly dressed in garments  ill-matched and worse fitting; his arms were abnormally long, his  shoulders rounded and stooping, and his eyes were at once dull and  furtive. He was the largest pupil, and the dullest, in Miss Grant's  charge, and as he came toward her, still silent, but with his mouth half  open, some of the little ones tittered audibly.    \"Silence!\" said the teacher, sternly. \"Peter, come here.\" Her tone grew  suddenly gentle. \"Have you seen Mr. Brierly this morning?\"    \"Uh hum!\" The boy stopped short and hung his head.    \"That's good news, Peter. Tell me where you saw him.\"    \"Down there,\" nodding toward the lake.    \"At the--lake?\"    \"Yep!\"    \"How long ago, Peter?\"    \"'Fore school--hour, maybe.\"    \"How far away, Peter?\"    \"Big ways. Most by Injun Hill.\"    \"Ah! and what was he doing?\"    \"Set on ground--lookin'.\"    \"Miss Grant!\" broke in the boy Johnny. \"He was goin' to shoot at a  mark; I guess he's got a new target down there, an' him an' some of the  boys shoots there, you know. Gracious!\" his eyes suddenly widening,  \"Dy'u s'pose he's got hurt, anyway?\"    Miss Grant turned quickly toward the simpleton.    \"Peter, you are sure it was this morning that you saw Mr. Brierly?\"    \"Uh hum.\"    \"And, was he alone?\"    \"Uh hum.\"    \"Who else did you see down there, Peter?\"    The boy lifted his arm, shielding his eyes with it as if expecting a  blow.    \"I bet some one's tried ter hit him!\" commented Johnny.    \"Hush, Johnny! Peter, what is it? Did some one frighten you?\"    The boy wagged his head.    \"Who was it?\"    \"N--Nothin'--\" Peter began to whimper.    \"You must answer me, Peter; was any one else by the lake? Whom else did  you see?\"    \"A--a--ghost!\" blubbered the boy, and this was all she could gain from  him.    And now the children began to whisper, and some of the elder to suggest  possibilities.    \"Maybe he's met a tramp.\"    \"P'r'aps he's sprained his ankle!\"    \"P'r'aps he's falled into the lake, teacher,\" piped a six-year-old.    \"Poh!\" retorted a small boy. \"He kin swim like--anything.\"    \"Children, be silent!\" A look of annoyance had suddenly relaxed the  strained, set look of the under teacher's white face as she recalled, at  the moment, how she had heard Mr. Samuel Doran--president of the board  of school directors--ask Mr. Brierly to drop in at his office that  morning to look at some specimen school books. That was the evening  before, and, doubtless, he was there now.    Miss Grant bit her lip, vexed at her folly and fright. But after a  moment's reflection she turned again to Johnny Robbins, saying:    \"Johnny, will you go back as far as Mr. Doran's house? Go to the office  door, and if Mr. Brierly is there, as I think he will be, ask him if he  would like me to hear his classes until he is at liberty.\"    Again the ready messenger caught up his flapping straw hat, while a  little flutter of relief ran through the school, and Miss Grant went  back to her desk, the look of vexation still upon her face.    Five minutes' brisk trotting brought the boy to Mr. Doran's door, which  was much nearer than the Fry homestead, and less than five minutes found  him again at the school-house door.    \"Miss Grant,\" he cried, excitedly, \"he wa'n't there, nor haint been; an'  Mr. Doran's startin' right out, with two or three other men, to hunt  him. He says there's somethin' wrong about it.\"          CHAPTER II.    FOUND.      \"I suppose it's all right,\" said Samuel Doran, as he walked toward the  school-house, followed by three or four of the villagers, \"called\"  because of their nearness, rather than \"chosen\"; \"but Brierly's  certainly the last man to let any ordinary matter keep him from his  post. We'll hear what Miss Grant has to say.\"    Miss Grant met the group at the gate, and when she had told them all she  had to tell, ending with the testimony of the boy Peter, and the  suggestion concerning the target-shooting.    \"Sho!\" broke in one of the men, as she was about to express her personal  opinion and her fears, \"that's the top an' bottom of the hull business!  Brierly's regularly took with ashootin' at a mark. I've been out with  him two or three evenin's of late. He's just got int'rusted, and forgot  ter look at his watch. We'll find him safe enough som'e'res along the  bank; let's cut across the woods.\"    \"He must have heard the bell,\" objected Mr. Doran, \"but, of course, if  Peter Kramer saw him down there, that's our way. Don't be anxious, Miss  Grant; probably Hopkins is right.\"    The road which they followed for some distance ran a somewhat devious  course through the wood, which one entered very soon after leaving the  school-house. It ran along the hillside, near its base, but still  somewhat above the stretch of ground, fully a hundred yards in width,  between it and the lake shore.    Above the road, to eastward, the wooded growth climbed the gentle upward  slope, growing, as it seemed, more and more dense and shadowy as it  mounted. But between the road and the river the trees grew less densely,  with numerous sunny openings, but with much undergrowth, here and there,  of hazel and sumach, wild vines, and along the border of the lake the  low overhanging scrub willow.    For more than a fourth of a mile the four men followed the road, walking  in couples, and not far apart, and contenting themselves with an  occasional \"hallo, Brierly,\" and with peering into the openings through  which they could see the lake shore as they passed along.    A little further on, however, a bit of rising ground cut off all sight  of the lake for a short distance. It was an oblong mound, so shapely, so  evenly proportioned that it had became known as the Indian Mound, and  was believed to have been the work of the aborigines, a prehistoric  fortification, or burial place.    As they came opposite this mound, the man Hopkins stopped, saying:    \"Hadn't a couple of us fellers better go round the mound on t'other  side? Course, if he's on the bank, an' all right, he'd ort to hear  us--but----\"    \"Yes,\" broke in the leader, who had been silent and very grave for some  moments. \"Go that way, Hopkins, and we'll keep to the road and meet you  at the further end of the mound.\"    They separated silently, and for some moments Mr. Doran and his  companions walked on, still silent, then--    \"We ought to have brought that simpleton along,\" Doran said, as if  meditating. \"The Kramers live only a quarter of a mile beyond the mound,  and it must have been near here--Stop!\"    He drew his companions back from the track, as a pony's head appeared  around a curve of the road; and then, as a black shetland and low  phaeton came in sight, he stepped forward again, and took off his hat.    He was squarely in the middle of the road, and the lady in the little  phaeton pulled up her pony and met his gaze with a look of mute inquiry.  She was a small, fair woman, with pale, regular features and large blue  eyes. She was dressed in mourning, and, beyond a doubt, was not a native  of Glenville.    \"Excuse my haste, ma'am,\" said Doran, coming to the side of the phaeton.  \"I'm James Doran, owner of the stable where this horse belongs, and we  are out in search of our schoolmaster. Have you seen a tall young man  along this road anywhere?\"    The lady was silent a moment, then--\"Was he a fair young man?\" she  asked, slowly.    \"Yes, tall and fair.\"    The lady gathered up her reins.    \"I passed such a person,\" she said, \"when I drove out of town shortly  after breakfast. He was going south, as I was. It must have been  somewhere not far from this place.\"    \"And--did you see his face?\"    \"No; the pony was fresh then, and I was intent upon him.\"    She lifted the reins, and then turned as if to speak again when the man  who had been a silent witness of the little dialogue came a step nearer.    \"I s'pose you hav'n't heard any noise--a pistol shot--nor anythin' like  that, have ye, ma'am?\"    \"Mercy! No, indeed! Why, what has happened?\"    Before either could answer, there came a shout from the direction of the  lake shore.    \"Doran, come--quick!\"    They were directly opposite the mound, at its central or highest point,  and, turning swiftly, James Doran saw the man Hopkins at the top of it,  waving his arms frantically.    \"Is he found?\" called Doran, moving toward him.    \"Yes. He's hurt!\"    With the words Hopkins disappeared behind the knoll, but Doran was near  enough to see that the man's face was scared and pale. He turned and  called sharply to the lady, who had taken up her whip and was driving  on.    \"Madam, stop! There's a man hurt. Wait there a moment; we may need your  horse.\" The last words were uttered as he ran up the mound, his  companions close at his heels. And the lady checked the willing pony  once more with a look half reluctant, wholly troubled.    \"What a position,\" she said to herself, impatiently. \"These villagers  are not diffident, upon my word.\"    A few moments only had passed when approaching footsteps and the sound  of quick panting breaths caused her to turn her head, and she saw James  Doran running swiftly toward her, pale faced, and too full of anxiety  to be observant of the courtesies.    \"You must let me drive back to town with you, madam,\" he panted,  springing into the little vehicle with a force that tried its springs  and wrought havoc with the voluminous folds of the lady's gown. \"We must  have the doctor, and--the coroner, too, I fear--at once!\"    He put out his hand for the reins, but she anticipated the movement and  struck the pony a sharp and sudden blow that sent him galloping townward  at the top of his speed, the reins still in her two small,  perfectly-gloved hands.    For a few moments no word was spoken; then, without turning her eyes  from the road, she asked:    \"What is it?\"    \"Death, I'm"]]]
