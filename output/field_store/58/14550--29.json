During the  year 1907 a large number of wolves and coyotes were captured in and  near the forest reserves: the number from the various states being as  follows:      STATE.        WOLVES.     COYOTES.

On the Gila National Forest 36 wolves and 30 coyotes were killed by  one forest guard, who sent the skulls to the Biological Survey for  identification, as well as the skulls of 9 bears, 7 mountain lions,  17 bobcats, and 46 grey foxes. One den of 8 very young wolf pups was  taken March 13. These statistics are from Circular 63, issued by the  U. S. Department of Agriculture.    Wolves are great ramblers, traveling over a large section of country.  Like almost all other animals of rambling habits, they have their  regular routes of travel. By this, we mean they follow the same  valleys, passes, water courses, etc., but when in pursuit of game  they sometimes stray quite a long distance out of their course.      [Illustration: Track of the Grey Wolf, Compared With That of a  Dog.]    The track of the wolf resembles that of a dog, but is a trifle  narrower in proportion to its length. The difference is in the two  middle toes, which are somewhat longer on the wolf, however, the  difference is so slight that it could easily pass unnoticed. When the  wolf is running these toes are spread well apart. The length of step  when the animal is walking will be from 18 to 24 inches, and the  average footprint will measure about 2 3/4 or 3 inches in width by  about 3 1/2 or 4 inches in length. Ernest Thompson Seton, the  naturalist claims that he can judge with fair accuracy, the weight of  a wolf by the size of the track. He allows twenty pounds for each  inch in length, of the foot print.        CHAPTER II.    THE COYOTE.    In the western parts of the United States, the coyote is far more  abundant than the grey, or timber wolf, but its range is more limited  as it is found only in those parts lying west of the Mississippi  River and in the western portion of the Dominion of Canada. As there  are a number of varieties of the timber wolf, so it is with the  coyote, but naturalists have never yet been able to agree on the  number of types and their distribution. In the Southwest, it appears  there are several distinct varieties, showing considerable difference  in size and color. Mr. Vasma Brown, a noted coyote trapper of Texas  has the following to say on the subject:    \"I have lived in Texas nineteen years and have had some years of  experience with the coyotes, coons and cats. Some coyotes are of a  silver-grey color, others are dark brown. The ends of their hair are  jet black and it makes them look brown. Some have black tips on the  tail and some white. The dark variety are the most vicious of the  two.\"    With the exception of the southwestern section, it is probable that  the coyotes of all portions of the Great Plains and the country to  the westward are of the same variety, and a description of this, the  most common type will answer for the species. In size, the coyote or  prairie wolf is considerably smaller than the timber wolf, the  largest specimens of the former being about equal in size to the  smallest adult wolves. The average coyote will measure about  thirty-six or thirty-eight inches from the end of the nose to the  base of the tail, which is about sixteen inches additional length.  The fur is of about the same texture as that of the grey fox and the  general color is fulvous, black and white hairs being mingled in  parts, giving a grizzled appearance. The ears are larger,  comparatively than those of the grey wolf, and the muzzle is more  pointed. All through the animal appears to be of more delicate build.  A larger form of the coyote is found in Minnesota and the adjoining  territory and is commonly known as the \"brush wolf\". Whether this is  a distinct variety is not known.    Coyotes are intelligent and cunning animals and their habits and  general appearance suggest the fox rather than the wolf. While they  are greedy, bloodthirsty creatures, they are sneaking and cowardly  and never kill animals larger than deer, in fact they rarely attack  such large game. An Arizona trapper writes:    \"The coyote bears the same relation to the wolf family that the  Apache Indian does to the human race. It is a belief among some of  the Apaches that they turn into coyotes when they depart this life,  and nothing will induce one of them to kill a coyote. Like the Indian  he is sneaky and treacherous, and full of the devil.\"    While there is no doubt that the animal enjoys its wild, free life,  it always has a miserable, distressed expression. It carries its tail  in a drooping manner and slinks out of sight like a dog that has been  doing wrong and has a troubled conscience.    The high piercing cry of the animal, which is so different from the  deep bass note of the timber wolf, is mournful in the extreme. In the  morning before the coyotes retire for the day, they stop on the top  of some elevation and sound their \"reveille\", which once heard will  never be forgotten. It is a shrill, piercing note, combining a howl  with a bark and although in all probability there will be only a pair  of the animals, one who does not know would be inclined to think that  the number is larger, the notes are so commingled.      [Illustration: Coyote and Badger Killed in Texas.]    Coyotes live in natural dens in the rocks, also in dens of badgers,  in the prairie country. In the \"Bad Lands\" of the West and the foot  hills of the mountain ranges, wind worn holes in the rim-rock and  buttes are quite common and the animals have no trouble in securing a  good den. Naturally, they select the most secluded and inaccessible  places for their dens. The food of the coyote consists of small game,  such as hares and grouse, prairie dogs and any other small animals  that they can capture. In the sheep raising districts of the Western  States they are very destructive to sheep and in those parts it is  probable that their food consists mostly of mutton. They feed on  carrion and have a particular liking for horse flesh. They also kill  badgers and when conditions are very favorable may kill an occasional  deer or antelope. They also sometimes kill calves and hogs.    Speaking of conditions in Oregon and other parts of the Northwest,  one of our friends writes:    \"The prairie wolf or coyote in the Western states are becoming so  numerous that it looks as though the sheep industry in Idaho and  Eastern Oregon would soon be a thing of the past, if something it not  done to lesson the number of the destructive coyotes.    \"Twenty years ago there were a great many coyotes in Oregon, but the  black tail rabbits were so numerous then that the coyote contented  himself with them and did not molest the sheep to any great extent.  Idaho and Oregon both put a bounty on rabbits, which soon caused them  to become scarce, then the coyotes began their depredations among the  sheep. The wool growers supplied themselves with plenty of strychnine  and kept the coyote reduced to quite an extent. Of late years it  seems that poison will not kill a coyote. As soon as he feels the  effect of the poison he throws up the bait he has just eaten, and in  a few minutes he is all right.    The only way to kill coyotes these days is with the gun, the trap or  with dogs. They are so thick here now that hounds would not be much  good, as the coyotes would change at any time and run them down. I  don't think there was a band of sheep anywhere in this country but  what suffered more or less from coyotes last winter. I trapped some  last winter for the Munz Brothers, and I saw where 48 sheep had been  killed at one camp. They had been camped there about ten days. This  is about an average killing if the weather is stormy.    \"In Southeastern Oregon there is a desert about one hundred miles  square, and thirty or forty bands of sheep feed there every winter.  They run from two to three thousand sheep in a band. The sheep men on  this desert last winter, 1904-'05, paid $40.00 per month and board  for trappers to trap coyotes, and the trappers were allowed to keep  the furs they caught. Some of them made very large wages.\"    It is said that when hunting rabbits, two coyotes will join forces  and in this way one animal will drive the game to within reach of the  other, thus avoiding the fatigue caused by running down game.  Naturalists also claim that the adult animals will sometimes drive  the game close to the den, so that the young coyotes may have the  opportunity of killing it. They frequently pick up scraps about the  camps, and if undisturbed, will in a short time, lose much of their  timidity. Old camping places are always inspected in the hopes of  finding some morsel of food, and one can always find coyote tracks in  the ashes of the campfire.    Though the coyote belongs to the flesh-eating class of animals, it is  not strictly carnivorous. In late summer when the wild rose tips are  red and sweet and berries are plentiful, its flesh eating  propensities forsake it in part and it adds fruit to its \"bill of  fare\". Whether this is caused by hunger or a change of appetite, or  whether the fruit acts as a tonic and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#2)"],[1,"west and the Verdigris River  watershed on the east. The gradient of Middle Caney in Chautauqua County  is 10.8 feet per mile. Its largest tributary, North Caney Creek, has a  gradient of 15.5 feet per mile.    The Elk River Basin resembles the Big Caney River Basin topographically.  Elk River has a gradient of 14.4 feet per mile.          PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STREAMS      The stream channels derive their physical characteristics from the  geological make-up of the area and from land-use. The Arkansas River  typically has low banks; however, in a few places, as in the NE 1/4 of  Section 21, T. 33 S, R. 3 E, it cuts into limestone members to form  steep rocky banks. The bottom is predominantly sand. In years of heavy  rainfall the river is turbid, but during 1956, when it occupied only a  small portion of its channel, it was clear each time observed. All  streams surveyed were clear except after short periods of flooding in  June, and except in some isolated pools where cattle had access to the  water.    In the Walnut River, sand bottoms occur in the lower part of the stream  but the sand is coarser than that of the Arkansas River. Upstream,  gravel and rubble bottoms become more common. Steep rocky banks border  most of the course of the Walnut. During 1956, stream-flow was confined  to the center of the channel, remote from these rocky banks.    The rubble and bedrock bottoms found in most streams of the Flint Hills  have been described. In the alluvial valleys of their lower courses mud  bottoms are found. Gravel is present in some places but sand is absent.  Banks are variable but often steep and wooded. Along east- or  west-flowing streams the north bank characteristically is low and  sloping whereas the south bank is high, rises abruptly, and in many  places is continuous with wooded hills. The lower sections of Otter  Creek, Cedar Creek, and Rock Creek fit this description (Bass, 1929:19)  especially well, as does Elk River near Howard.    Streams in the Chautauqua Hills resemble those of the Flint Hills in  physical characteristics, except that a larger admixture of sandstone  occurs in the rubble.          CLIMATE      The climate of the area is characterized by those fluctuations of  temperature, wind, and rainfall typical of the Great Plains. The mean  annual temperature is 58 degrees; the mean July temperature is 81  degrees; the mean January temperature is approximately 34 degrees. The  mean annual precipitation is 32.9 in Cowley County, 38.5 in Chautauqua  County, and 35.1 in Elk County. Wind movement is great; Flora (1948:6)  states that south-central Kansas ranks close to some of the windiest  inland areas in the United States.    The area has been periodically subjected to droughts and floods. Such  phenomena are of special interest to ichthyological workers in the area.  At the time of this study drought conditions, which began in 1952,  prevailed. Even in this period of drought, however, flooding occurred on  Grouse Creek and water was high in Big Caney River after heavy local  rains on the headwaters of these streams on June 22, 1956. Some of the  lower tributaries of these same streams (such as Crab Creek and Cedar  Creek) did not flow while the mainstreams were flooding. This  illustrates the local nature of many of the summer rains in the area.    Table 1 indicates maximum, minimum, and average discharges in cubic feet  per second at several stations in the area and on nearby streams. These  figures were provided by the U. S. Geological Survey.

Within these monthly variations there are also  pronounced daily fluctuations; on Big Caney River approximately 1/4 mile  south of Elgin, Kansas, discharge in cubic feet per second for May,  1944, ranged from .7 to 9,270.0 and for May, 1956, from .03 to 20.0.

Land-use has  altered the original floral communities, especially in the intensively  cultivated area of western Cowley County and in the river valleys.    The sandy Arkansas River floodplain exhibits several stages ranging from  sparsely vegetated sandy mounds near the river through stages of Johnson  grass, willow, and cottonwood, to an elm-hackberry fringe-forest. The  Wellington formation bordering the floodplain supports a prairie flora  where not disturbed by cultivation; Gates (1936:15) designates this as a  part of the mixed bluestem and short-grass region. _Andropogon gerardi_  Vitman., _Andropogon scoparius_ Michx., _Sorghastrum nutans_ (L.), and  _Panicum virgatum_ L. are important grasses in the hilly pasture-lands.  Although much of this land is virgin prairie, the tall, lush condition  of the grasses described by early writers such as Mooso (1888:304), and  by local residents, is not seen today. These residents speak of slough  grasses (probably _Tripsacum dactyloides_ L. and _Spartina pectinata_  Link.) that originally formed rank growths. These no doubt helped  conserve water and stabilize flow in small headwater creeks. Remnants of  some of these sloughs can still be found. The streams in the Flint Hills  have fringe-forests of elm, hackberry, walnut, ash, and willow.    Eastward from the Flint Hills these fringe-forests become thicker with a  greater admixture of hickories and oaks. The north slopes of hills also  become more wooded. However, grassland remains predominant over woodland  in western Chautauqua and Elk counties, whereas in the eastern one-half  of Chautauqua County and the eastern one-third of Elk County the wooded  Chautauqua Hills prevail. This is one of the most extensive wooded  upland areas in Kansas. Hale (1955:167) describes this woodland as part  of an ecotonal scrub-oak forest bordering the Great Plains south through  Texas. He found stand dominants in these wooded areas to be _Quercus  marilandica_ Muenchh., _Quercus stellata_ Wang., and _Quercus velutina_  Lam.    Few true aquatic plants were observed in the Arkansas River although  mats of duckweed were found in shallow backwater pools at station A-3  (Fig. 2) on December 22, 1956. In the Walnut River _Najas guadalupensis_  Spreng. was common at station W-2. Stones were usually covered with  algae in both the Arkansas and Walnut rivers. A red bloom, possibly  attributable to _Euglena rubra_ (Johnson), was observed on a tributary  of the Walnut River on July 9, 1956, at station W-4.    Green algae were abundant at all stations in the Caney, Elk, and Grouse  systems during May and June, 1956, and reappeared late in September.  _Chara_ sp. was common in these streams in April and May.    The most characteristic rooted aquatic of streams in the Flint Hills was  _Justicia americana_ L. At station G-7 on Grouse Creek and Station C-8  on Big Caney River (Fig. 3), _Nelumbo lutea_ (Willd.) was found.  _Myriophyllum heterophyllum_ Michx. formed dense floating mats at a  number of stations. Other aquatic plants observed in the Caney, Elk, and  Grouse systems included _Potamogeton gramineus_ L., _Potamogeton  nodosus_ Poir., _Potamogeton foliosus_ Raf., _Sagittaria latifolia_  Willd., _Typha latifolia_ L., and _Jussiaea diffusa_ Forsk.
