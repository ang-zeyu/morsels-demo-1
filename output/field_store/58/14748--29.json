Besides  this, she had turned around and around so many times trying to find out  where she was, that now she couldn't even tell which direction the  farm-house ought to be in; and this began to worry her and make her  feel anxious.    \"I'm 'fraid, Shaggy Man,\" she said, with a sigh, \"that we're lost!\"    \"That's nothing to be afraid of,\" he replied, throwing away the core of  his apple and beginning to eat another one.  \"Each of these roads must  lead somewhere, or it wouldn't be here.  So what does it matter?\"    \"I want to go home again,\" she said.    \"Well, why don't you?\"  said he.    \"I don't know which road to take.\"    \"That is too bad,\" he said, shaking his shaggy head gravely.  \"I wish I  could help you; but I can't.  I'm a stranger in these parts.\"    \"Seems as if I were, too,\" she said, sitting down beside him.  \"It's  funny.  A few minutes ago I was home, and I just came to show you the  way to Butterfield--\"    \"So I shouldn't make a mistake and go there--\"    \"And now I'm lost myself and don't know how to get home!\"    \"Have an apple,\" suggested the shaggy man, handing her one with pretty  red cheeks.    \"I'm not hungry,\" said Dorothy, pushing it away.    \"But you may be, to-morrow; then you'll be sorry you didn't eat the  apple,\" said he.    \"If I am, I'll eat the apple then,\" promised Dorothy.    \"Perhaps there won't be any apple then,\" he returned, beginning to eat  the red-cheeked one himself.  \"Dogs sometimes can find their way home  better than people,\" he went on; \"perhaps your dog can lead you back to  the farm.\"    \"Will you, Toto?\" asked Dorothy.    Toto wagged his tail vigorously.    \"All right,\" said the girl; \"let's go home.\"    Toto looked around a minute and dashed up one of the roads.    \"Good-bye, Shaggy Man,\" called Dorothy, and ran after Toto.  The little  dog pranced briskly along for some distance; when he turned around and  looked at his mistress questioningly.    \"Oh, don't 'spect ME to tell you anything; I don't know the way,\" she  said.  \"You'll have to find it yourself.\"    But Toto couldn't.  He wagged his tail, and sneezed, and shook his  ears, and trotted back where they had left the shaggy man.  From here  he started along another road; then came back and tried another; but  each time he found the way strange and decided it would not take them  to the farm-house.  Finally, when Dorothy had begun to tire with  chasing after him, Toto sat down panting beside the shaggy man and gave  up.    Dorothy sat down, too, very thoughtful.  The little girl had  encountered some queer adventures since she came to live at the farm;  but this was the queerest of them all.  To get lost in fifteen minutes,  so near to her home and in the unromantic State of Kansas, was an  experience that fairly bewildered her.    \"Will your folks worry?\" asked the shaggy man, his eyes twinkling in a  pleasant way.    \"I s'pose so,\" answered Dorothy with a sigh.  \"Uncle Henry says there's  ALWAYS something happening to me; but I've always come home safe at the  last.  So perhaps he'll take comfort and think I'll come home safe this  time.\"    \"I'm sure you will,\" said the shaggy man, smilingly nodding at her.  \"Good little girls never come to any harm, you know.  For my part, I'm  good, too; so nothing ever hurts me.\"    Dorothy looked at him curiously.  His clothes were shaggy, his boots  were shaggy and full of holes, and his hair and whiskers were shaggy.  But his smile was sweet and his eyes were kind.    \"Why didn't you want to go to Butterfield?\" she asked.    \"Because a man lives there who owes me fifteen cents, and if I went to  Butterfield and he saw me he'd want to pay me the money.  I don't want  money, my dear.\"    \"Why not?\" she inquired.    \"Money,\" declared the shaggy man, \"makes people proud and haughty.  I  don't want to be proud and haughty.  All I want is to have people love  me; and as long as I own the Love Magnet, everyone I meet is sure to  love me dearly.\"    \"The Love Magnet!  Why, what's that?\"    \"I'll show you, if you won't tell any one,\" he answered, in a low,  mysterious voice.    \"There isn't any one to tell, 'cept Toto,\" said the girl.    The shaggy man searched in one pocket, carefully; and in another  pocket; and in a third.  At last he drew out a small parcel wrapped in  crumpled paper and tied with a cotton string.  He unwound the string,  opened the parcel, and took out a bit of metal shaped like a horseshoe.  It was dull and brown, and not very pretty.    \"This, my dear,\" said he, impressively, \"is the wonderful Love Magnet.  It was given me by an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islands--where there are  no sandwiches at all--and as long as I carry it every living thing I  meet will love me dearly.\"    \"Why didn't the Eskimo keep it?\"  she asked, looking at the Magnet with  interest.    \"He got tired of being loved and longed for some one to hate him.  So  he gave me the Magnet and the very next day a grizzly bear ate him.\"    \"Wasn't he sorry then?\" she inquired.    \"He didn't say,\" replied the shaggy man, wrapping and tying the Love  Magnet with great care and putting it away in another pocket.  \"But the  bear didn't seem sorry a bit,\" he added.    \"Did you know the bear?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes; we used to play ball together in the Caviar Islands.  The bear  loved me because I had the Love Magnet.  I couldn't blame him for  eating the Eskimo, because it was his nature to do so.\"    \"Once,\" said Dorothy, \"I knew a Hungry Tiger who longed to eat fat  babies, because it was his nature to; but he never ate any because he  had a Conscience.\"    \"This bear,\" replied the shaggy man, with a sigh, \"had no Conscience,  you see.\"    The shaggy man sat silent for several minutes, apparently considering  the cases of the bear and the tiger, while Toto watched him with an air  of great interest.  The little dog was doubtless thinking of his ride  in the shaggy man's pocket and planning to keep out of reach in the  future.    At last the shaggy man turned and inquired, \"What's your name, little  girl?\"    \"My name's Dorothy,\" said she, jumping up again, \"but what are we going  to do?  We can't stay here forever, you know.\"    \"Let's take the seventh road,\" he suggested.  \"Seven is a lucky number  for little girls named Dorothy.\"    \"The seventh from where?\"    \"From where you begin to count.\"    So she counted seven roads, and the seventh looked just like all the  others; but the shaggy man got up from the ground where he had been  sitting and started down this road as if sure it was the best way to  go; and Dorothy and Toto followed him.          2.  Dorothy Meets Button-Bright      The seventh road was a good road, and curved this way and that--winding  through green meadows and fields covered with daisies and buttercups  and past groups of shady trees.  There were no houses of any sort to be  seen, and for some distance they met with no living creature at all.    Dorothy began to fear they were getting a good way from the farm-house,  since here everything was strange to her; but it would do no good at  all to go back where the other roads all met, because the next one they  chose might lead her just as far from home.    She kept on beside the shaggy man, who whistled cheerful tunes to  beguile the journey, until by and by they followed a turn in the road  and saw before them a big chestnut tree making a shady spot over the  highway.  In the shade sat a little boy dressed in sailor clothes, who  was digging a hole in the earth with a bit of wood.  He must have been  digging some time, because the hole was already big enough to drop a  football into.    Dorothy and Toto and the shaggy man came to a halt before the little  boy, who kept on digging in a sober and persistent fashion.    \"Who are you?\" asked the girl.    He looked up at her calmly.  His face was round and chubby and his eyes  were big, blue and earnest.    \"I'm Button-Bright,\" said he.    \"But what's your real name?\" she inquired.    \"Button-Bright.\"    \"That isn't a really-truly name!\" she exclaimed.    \"Isn't it?\" he asked, still digging.    \"'Course not.  It's just a--a thing to call you by.  You must have a  name.\"    \"Must I?\"    \"To be sure.  What does your mama call you?\"    He paused in his digging and tried to think.    \"Papa always said I was bright as a button; so mama always called me  Button-Bright,\" he said.    \"What is your papa's name?\"    \"Just Papa.\"    \"What else?\"    \"Don't know.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man, smiling.  \"We'll call the boy  Button-Bright, as his mama does.  That name is as good as any, and  better than some.\"    Dorothy watched the boy dig.    \"Where do you live?\" she asked.    \"Don't know,\" was the reply.    \"How did you come here?\"    \"Don't know,\" he said again.    \"Don't you know where you came from?\"    \"No,\" said he.    \"Why, he must be lost,\" she said to the shaggy man.  She turned to the  boy once more.    \"What are you going to do?\" she inquired.    \"Dig,\" said he.    \"But you can't dig forever; and what are you going to do then?\" she  persisted.    \"Don't know,\" said the boy.    \"But you MUST know SOMETHING,\" declared Dorothy, getting provoked.    \"Must I?\"  he asked, looking up in surprise.    \"Of course you must.\"    \"What must I know?\"    \"What's going to become of you, for one thing,\" she answered.    \"Do YOU know what's going to become of me?\" he asked.    \"Not--not 'zactly,\" she admitted.    \"Do you know what's going to become of YOU?\"  he continued, earnestly.    \"I can't say I do,\" replied Dorothy, remembering her present  difficulties.    The shaggy man laughed.    \"No one knows everything, Dorothy,\" he said.    \"But Button-Bright doesn't seem to know ANYthing,\" she declared.  \"Do  you, Button-Bright?\"    He shook his head, which had pretty curls all over it, and replied with  perfect calmness:    \"Don't know.\"    Never before had Dorothy met with anyone who could give her so little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#2)"],[1,"she  became hungry--as she was sure to do before long--and no fresh water to  drink and no dry clothes to put on.    \"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed, with a laugh.  \"You're in a pretty  fix, Dorothy Gale, I can tell you! and I haven't the least idea how  you're going to get out of it!\"    As if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on, and the  gray clouds overhead changed to inky blackness.  But the wind, as if  satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks, stopped blowing this  ocean and hurried away to another part of the world to blow something  else; so that the waves, not being joggled any more, began to quiet  down and behave themselves.    It was lucky for Dorothy, I think, that the storm subsided; otherwise,  brave though she was, I fear she might have perished.  Many children,  in her place, would have wept and given way to despair; but because  Dorothy had encountered so many adventures and come safely through them  it did not occur to her at this time to be especially afraid.  She was  wet and uncomfortable, it is true; but, after sighing that one sigh I  told you of, she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness  and decided to patiently await whatever her fate might be.    By and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overhead,  with a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars  winking merrily at Dorothy when she looked their way.  The coop did not  toss around any more, but rode the waves more gently--almost like a  cradle rocking--so that the floor upon which Dorothy stood was no  longer swept by water coming through the slats.  Seeing this, and being  quite exhausted by the excitement of the past few hours, the little  girl decided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength  and the easiest way in which she could pass the time.  The floor was  damp and she was herself wringing wet, but fortunately this was a warm  climate and she did not feel at all cold.    So she sat down in a corner of the coop, leaned her back against the  slats, nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes, and was  asleep in half a minute.          2.  The Yellow Hen      A strange noise awoke Dorothy, who opened her eyes to find that day had  dawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky.  She had been  dreaming that she was back in Kansas again, and playing in the old  barn-yard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around her; and at  first, as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, she really imagined she  was there.    \"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut!  Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut!\"    Ah; here again was the strange noise that had awakened her.  Surely it  was a hen cackling!  But her wide-open eyes first saw, through the  slats of the coop, the blue waves of the ocean, now calm and placid,  and her thoughts flew back to the past night, so full of danger and  discomfort.  Also she began to remember that she was a waif of the  storm, adrift upon a treacherous and unknown sea.    \"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-w-w--kut!\"    \"What's that?\" cried Dorothy, starting to her feet.    \"Why, I've just laid an egg, that's all,\" replied a small, but sharp  and distinct voice, and looking around her the little girl discovered a  yellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the coop.    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed, in surprise; \"have YOU been here all night,  too?\"    \"Of course,\" answered the hen, fluttering her wings and yawning.  \"When  the coop blew away from the ship I clung fast to this corner, with  claws and beak, for I knew if I fell into the water I'd surely be  drowned.  Indeed, I nearly drowned, as it was, with all that water  washing over me.  I never was so wet before in my life!\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Dorothy, \"it was pretty wet, for a time, I know.  But do  you feel comfor'ble now?\"    \"Not very.  The sun has helped to dry my feathers, as it has your  dress, and I feel better since I laid my morning egg.  But what's to  become of us, I should like to know, afloat on this big pond?\"    \"I'd like to know that, too,\" said Dorothy.  \"But, tell me; how does it  happen that you are able to talk?  I thought hens could only cluck and  cackle.\"    \"Why, as for that,\" answered the yellow hen thoughtfully, \"I've clucked  and cackled all my life, and never spoken a word before this morning,  that I can remember.  But when you asked a question, a minute ago, it  seemed the most natural thing in the world to answer you.  So I spoke,  and I seem to keep on speaking, just as you and other human beings do.  Strange, isn't it?\"    \"Very,\" replied Dorothy.  \"If we were in the Land of Oz, I wouldn't  think it so queer, because many of the animals can talk in that fairy  country.  But out here in the ocean must be a good long way from Oz.\"    \"How is my grammar?\" asked the yellow hen, anxiously.  \"Do I speak  quite properly, in your judgment?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dorothy, \"you do very well, for a beginner.\"    \"I'm glad to know that,\" continued the yellow hen, in a confidential  tone; \"because, if one is going to talk, it's best to talk correctly.  The red rooster has often said that my cluck and my cackle were quite  perfect; and now it's a comfort to know I am talking properly.\"    \"I'm beginning to get hungry,\" remarked Dorothy.  \"It's breakfast time;  but there's no breakfast.\"    \"You may have my egg,\" said the yellow hen.  \"I don't care for it, you  know.\"    \"Don't you want to hatch it?\" asked the little girl, in surprise.    \"No, indeed; I never care to hatch eggs unless I've a nice snug nest,  in some quiet place, with a baker's dozen of eggs under me.  That's  thirteen, you know, and it's a lucky number for hens.  So you may as  well eat this egg.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't POSS'BLY eat it, unless it was cooked,\" exclaimed  Dorothy.  \"But I'm much obliged for your kindness, just the same.\"    \"Don't mention it, my dear,\" answered the hen, calmly, and began  preening her feathers.    For a moment Dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea.  She was  still thinking of the egg, though; so presently she asked:    \"Why do you lay eggs, when you don't expect to hatch them?\"    \"It's a habit I have,\" replied the yellow hen.  \"It has always been my  pride to lay a fresh egg every morning, except when I'm moulting.  I  never feel like having my morning cackle till the egg is properly laid,  and without the chance to cackle I would not be happy.\"    \"It's strange,\" said the girl, reflectively; \"but as I'm not a hen I  can't be 'spected to understand that.\"    \"Certainly not, my dear.\"    Then Dorothy fell silent again.  The yellow hen was some company, and a  bit of comfort, too; but it was dreadfully lonely out on the big ocean,  nevertheless.    After a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat of the  coop, which was a little above Dorothy's head when she was sitting upon  the bottom, as she had been doing for some moments past.    \"Why, we are not far from land!\" exclaimed the hen.    \"Where?  Where is it?\" cried Dorothy, jumping up in great excitement.    \"Over there a little way,\" answered the hen, nodding her head in a  certain direction.  \"We seem to be drifting toward it, so that before  noon we ought to find ourselves upon dry land again.\"    \"I shall like that!\" said Dorothy, with a little sigh, for her feet and  legs were still wetted now and then by the sea-water that came through  the open slats.    \"So shall I,\" answered her companion.  \"There is nothing in the world  so miserable as a wet hen.\"    The land, which they seemed to be rapidly approaching, since it grew  more distinct every minute, was quite beautiful as viewed by the little  girl in the floating hen-coop.  Next to the water was a broad beach of  white sand and gravel, and farther back were several rocky hills, while  beyond these appeared a strip of green trees that marked the edge of a  forest.  But there were no houses to be seen, nor any sign of people  who might inhabit this unknown land.    \"I hope we shall find something to eat,\" said Dorothy, looking eagerly  at the pretty beach toward which they drifted.  \"It's long past  breakfast time, now.\"    \"I'm a trifle hungry, myself,\" declared the yellow hen.    \"Why don't you eat the egg?\" asked the child.  \"You don't need to have  your food cooked, as I do.\"    \"Do you take me for a cannibal?\" cried the hen, indignantly.  \"I do not  know what I have said or done that leads you to insult me!\"    \"I beg your pardon, I'm sure Mrs.--Mrs.--by the way, may I inquire your  name, ma'am?\" asked the little girl.    \"My name is Bill,\" said the yellow hen, somewhat gruffly.    \"Bill!  Why, that's a boy's name.\"    \"What difference does that make?\"    \"You're a lady hen, aren't you?\"    \"Of course.  But when I was first hatched out no one could tell whether  I was going to be a hen or a rooster; so the little boy at the farm  where I was born called me Bill, and made a pet of me because I was the  only yellow chicken in the whole brood.  When I grew up, and he found  that I didn't crow and fight, as all the roosters do, he did not think  to change my name, and every creature in the barn-yard, as well as the  people in the house, knew me as 'Bill.'  So Bill I've always been  called, and Bill is my name.\"    \"But it's all wrong, you know,\" declared Dorothy, earnestly; \"and, if  you don't mind, I shall call you 'Billina.'  Putting the 'eena' on the  end makes it a girl's name, you see.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind it in the least,\" returned the yellow hen.  \"It  doesn't matter at all what you call me, so long as I know the name  means ME.\"    \"Very well, Billina.  MY name is Dorothy Gale--just Dorothy to my  friends and Miss Gale to strangers.  You may call me Dorothy, if you  like.  We're getting very near the shore.  Do you suppose it is too  deep for me to wade the rest of the way?\"    \"Wait a few minutes longer.  The sunshine is warm and pleasant, and we  are in no hurry.\"    \"But my feet are all wet and soggy,\" said the girl.  \"My dress is dry "]]]
