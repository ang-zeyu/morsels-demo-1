Large females retain complete lateral and dorsolateral stripes.  The jowls of breeding males are swollen.                 [Illustration: Color Pattern Change Diagram]    ~Fig. 2.~ Diagrammatic representation of  ontogenetic change in color      pattern in _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_: A--hatchling, 34 mm.      snout-vent length; B--juvenile,  55 mm. snout-vent length;      C--subadult male, 80 mm. snout-vent length; D--small adult male,      100 mm. snout-vent length; E--large adult male, 120 mm. snout-vent      length.      _Geographic variation._--No noticeable geographic variation in this  subspecies is evident in the series from the Tepalcatepec Valley.  However, lizards from eastern Michoacan (Chinapa, 6 km. N of Tafetan,  6 km. S of Tzitzio, and 19 km. S of Tzitzio) differ slightly from  those from the Tepalcatepec Valley; the eastern specimens have fewer  dorsal granules and femoral pores, and a higher ratio of dorsal  granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules  around the body (see Tables 1-3). No large adult males are present in  the eastern series; the subadults and small adult males have color  patterns like lizards of similar size from the Tepalcatepec Valley.  The largest male from the east has a snout-vent length of 110 mm.,  rows of pale spots, and no trace of brown and tan cross-bars.  Specimens of _Cnemidophorus sacki sacki_ of equal size from Guerrero,  Morelos, and Puebla in the upper Balsas Basin have a tan dorsum with  dark brown cross-bars. The localities in eastern Michoacan are  intermediate geographically between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the  known range of the nominal subspecies in the upper Balsas Basin. In  characters of scutellation specimens from the east are intermediate  between _C. sacki sacki_ and _C. sacki zweifeli_ in the Tepalcatepec  Valley. However, in coloration the lizards from the east are like  those from the Tepalcatepec Valley, but differ distinctly from the  nominal subspecies. Therefore, the eastern series is referred to the  subspecies _C. sacki zweifeli_.    _Comparisons._--Four other species of _Cnemidophorus_ occur in the  Tepalcatepec Valley with _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_. Of these, _C.  calidipes_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 79 mm., 66 to 86 dorsal  granules, and a light brown dorsum with pale blue spots and vertical  bars; _C. communis communis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 135  mm., 105 to 144 dorsal granules, and a greenish tan dorsum with yellow  spots; _C. deppei infernalis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 84  mm., 91 to 120 dorsal granules, and a striped pattern throughout life;  and _C. lineatissimus exoristus_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 98  mm., 108 to 135 dorsal granules, and a middorsal yellow stripe and  vertical bars on the flanks. Both _calidipes_ and _communis_ are like  _sacki_ in possessing four enlarged supraoculars and enlarged  postantebrachials, whereas _deppei_ and _lineatissimus_ have three  enlarged supraoculars and granular postantebrachials. Juveniles of  _calidipes_ and _sacki_ are alike in coloration but different in the  extent of the supraorbital semicircle-series. In _calidipes_ the  supraorbital semicircle-series usually are complete, whereas in  _sacki_ the series never extended anterior to the posterior edge of  the frontal.          ~Table 1.--Variation in the Number of Dorsal Granules             in Three Subspecies of Cnemidophorus sacki~    Key for Table:     No. = Number of Specimens  SD = Standard Deviation     SE  = Standard Error   C/V = Coefficient of Variation    /======================================================================\\  |   ~Population~           | No. |  Range  | Mean |  SD  |  SE  | C/V  |  |--------------------------+-----+---------+------+------+------+------|  |_sacki sacki_             |     |         |      |      |      |      |  |   Entire Sample          | 106 |  88-105 | 96.3 | 4.16 | 0.40 | 3.92 |  |   Puebla: Tehuitzingo    |  22 |  88-103 | 95.1 | 4.18 | 0.89 | 4.39 |  |   Guerrero: Chilpancingo |  23 |  90-105 | 95.8 | 3.86 | 0.80 | 4.02 |  |   Guerrero: Mexcala      |  22 |  90-102 | 96.5 | 3.56 | 0.76 | 3.69 |  |   Morelos                |  39 |  89-105 | 97.2 | 4.56 | 0.73 | 4.69 |  |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      |  |_sacki zweifeli_          |     |         |      |      |      |      |  |   Entire Sample          | 191 |  91-117 | 106.2| 5.98 | 0.43 | 3.13 |  |   Michoacan: Tafetan     |  21 |  91-116 | 101.4| 8.04 | 1.75 | 7.92 |  |   Michoacan: Apatzingan  | 170 |  95-117 | 106.8| 5.42 | 1.32 | 3.19 |  |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      |  |_sacki occidentalis_[A]   |  62 |  97-118 | 106.3| 4.72 | 0.60 | 7.61 |  \\======================================================================/    [Footnote A: Data for _C. sacki occidentalis_ in Tables 1-3 are from  Zweifel (1959, Bull.

Both  _occidentalis_ and _zweifeli_ have variable, diffuse color patterns  in large adults, but _zweifeli_ differs from _occidentalis_ in having  a blue spot on the pink throat.    _Ecology._--In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley _Cnemidophorus sacki  zweifeli_ lives at elevations of 160 to 1300 meters. In the lower  parts of the valley the lizards live primarily in open scrub forests,  characterized by deciduous trees offering only partial shade from the  sun, especially during the prolonged dry season. Common trees in  this scrub forest are _Acacia cymbispina_, _Cercidium  plurifoliolatum_, _Mimosa distachya_, and _Prosopis juliflora_.    During the dry season (November through May) adult males apparently  aestivate; several large series collected in the winter include only  subadults and females. This absence of males is corroborated by  personal observations in the Tepalcatepec Valley in April and May. In  the summer rainy season the lizards are active in the morning and  again in the late afternoon; only _Cnemidophorus calidipes_ is active  during the heat of the midday. In some areas of the scrub forest  _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ is found in association with  _Cnemidophorus communis communis_. Throughout the scrub forest _C.  sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. deppei infernalis_. In some of the  more dense scrub forest, where _C. sacki zweifeli_ is not so abundant  as in the more open forest, it has been taken with _C. lineatissimus  exoristus_. In the open _Acacia-Cercidium_ associations on the valley  floor _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#2)"],[1,"Selected bibliography                                              152      Appendix A, Tags on whales, dolphins, and porpoises                154      Appendix B, Recording and reporting observations of cetaceans      at sea                                                           160      Appendix C, Stranded whales, dolphins, and porpoises; with a key      to the identification of stranded cetaceans of the western      North Atlantic                                                   163      Appendix D, Recording and reporting data on stranded cetaceans     169      Appendix E, List of institutions to contact regarding stranded      cetaceans                                                        171          The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) does not approve,      recommend or endorse any proprietary product or proprietary material      mentioned in this publication.

The animals described  are grouped not by scientific relationships but by similarities in  appearance in the field. Photographs of the animals in their natural  environment are the main aids to identification.    A dichotomized key is provided to aid in identification of stranded  cetaceans and appendices describe how and to whom to report data on live  and dead cetaceans.      INTRODUCTION    All whales, dolphins, and porpoises belong to an order or major  scientific group called the Cetacea by scientists. They are all mammals  (air-breathing animals which have hair in at least some stage of their  development, maintain a constant body temperature, bear their young  alive, and nurse them for a while) which have undergone extensive  changes in body form (anatomy) and function (physiology) to cope with a  life spent entirely in the water. The breathing aperture(s), called a  blowhole or blowholes, has (have) migrated to the top of the head to  facilitate breathing while swimming; the forward appendages have become  flippers; the hind appendages have nearly disappeared, they remain only  as small traces of bone deeply imbedded in the muscles. Propulsion is  provided by fibrous, horizontally flattened tail flukes.    Scientists recognize two suborders of living cetaceans: the whalebone  whales, suborder Mysticeti, and the toothed whales, suborder Odontoceti.  The two groups are separated in the following ways:    BALEEN OR WHALEBONE WHALES. These animals are called whalebone whales  because when fully formed instead of teeth they have up to 800 or more  plates of baleen or whalebone depending from the roof of the mouth. They  use these plates to strain their food, which consists of \"krill\"  (primarily small crustaceans) and/or small schooling fish, by taking  water into the mouth and forcing it out through the overlapping fringes  of the baleen plates. Baleen whales are externally distinguishable from  toothed whales by having paired blowholes. There are eight species of  baleen whales in the western North Atlantic, ranging in size from the  minke whale (just over 30 feet [about 9.1 m])[5] to the blue whale (85  feet [25.9 m]).    [Footnote 5: Throughout this guide, measurements are given first in feet  or inches, followed in parentheses by their equivalents in meters or  centimeters. It is recognized that field estimates cannot be as precise  as most of the conversions used.]    TOOTHED WHALES. Unlike the baleen whales, the toothed whales do have  teeth after birth. The teeth vary in number from 2 to over 250, though  they may sometimes be concealed beneath the gum. In addition, toothed  whales have only a single blowhole. This group includes the animals  commonly called dolphin or porpoise as well as some commonly called  whales (for example, the sperm whale). There are currently about 30  species of toothed whales known from the western North Atlantic, ranging  in maximum adult size from the common or harbor porpoise, which is  approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) long, up to the sperm whale which reaches a  length of 68 feet (20.7 m). Several other species which are expected to  be found in this region, though they have not yet been reported, are  also included in this guide.      CLASSIFICATION OF CETACEANS    In addition to the two suborders (Mysticeti and Odontoceti), the  cetacean order contains numerous families, genera, and species. Each of  these groupings represents a progressively more specialized division of  the animals into categories on the basis of similarities in their  skulls, postcranial skeletons, and external characteristics. The  discipline which concerns itself with naming an animal and assigning it  to its appropriate scientific category is known as taxonomy. An example  of the classification of a cetacean species is shown in the following:    SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE  ATLANTIC BOTTLENOSED DOLPHIN      Kingdom:      Animalia      all animals      Phylum:       Chordata      having at some stage a notochord,                                the precursor of the backbone      Subphylum:    Vertebrata    animals with backbones--fishes,                                amphibians, reptiles, birds,                                and mammals      Class:        Mammalia      animals that suckle their young      Order:        Cetacea       carnivorous, wholly aquatic                                mammals: whales, including                                dolphins and porpoises      Suborder:     Odontoceti    toothed whales as distinguished                                from Mysticeti, the baleen whales      Family:       Delphinidae   dolphins      Genus:        Tursiops      bottlenosed dolphins      Species:      truncatus     Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin    Modern taxonomy had its origin with the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus,  whose tenth edition of the _Systema Naturae_ in 1758 forms the official  starting point. Following Linnaeus, modern scientific names consist of  two words, a generic name, which has an initial capital, and a species  name, which rarely does, occasionally in botany (some species names  deriving from a person's name are capitalized). Both names are usually  of Latin origin (sometimes Greek) and are italicized or underlined.  These scientific names are of particular importance because, although  common names of species often are different in different countries or  even in different regions of the same country, the scientific name  remains the same. For example, the right whale is universally known as  _Eubalaena glacialis_ though its common names include black right whale,  nordcaper, sletbag, Biscay whale, and Biscayan right whale.    Although classification of many species is still in a state of flux, the  classification of western North Atlantic cetaceans followed in this  guide is as follows:                                                                             Page of                                                                  synoptic account                                                                    of the species      Order Cetacea      Suborder Mysticeti--Baleen whales        Family Balaenopteridae--Rorquals          _Balaenoptera acutorostrata_ Lacepede 1804     Minke whale              63          _Balaenoptera physalus_      (Linnaeus 1758)   Fin whale                26          _Balaenoptera musculus_      (Linnaeus 1758)   Blue whale               19          _Balaenoptera borealis_      Lesson 1828       Sei whale                32          _Balaenoptera edeni_         Anderson 1879     Bryde's whale            37          _Megaptera novaeangliae_     (Borowski 1781)   Humpback whale           40        Family Balaenidae--Right whales          _Balaena mysticetus_         Linnaeus 1758     Bowhead whale            49          _Eubalaena glacialis_        (Borowski 1781)   Right whale              52      Suborder Odontoceti--Toothed whales        Family Ziphiidae          _Mesoplodon bidens_          (Sowerby 1804)    North Sea                                                       beaked whale             82          _Mesoplodon densirostris_    (Blainville in    Dense-beaked                                     Desmarest 1817)     whale                  80          _Mesoplodon europaeus_       (Gervais 1855)    Antillean beaked whale   78          _Mesoplodon mirus_           True 1913         True's beaked whale      77          _Ziphius cavirostris_        G.
