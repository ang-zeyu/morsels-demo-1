[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#2)"],[1," frozen islands of the Arctic seas were once the seat  of luxurious vegetation and teemed with life. On Bathurst Island, which  lies in the latitude of 76 degrees, and is thus six hundred miles north  of the Arctic Circle, there have been found the bones of huge lizards  that could only have lived in the jungles of an almost tropical climate.    We cannot tell with any certainty just how and why these great changes  came about. But geologists have connected them with the alternating  rise and fall of the surface of the northern continent and its altitude  at various times above the level of the sea. Thus it seems probable  that the glacial period with the ice sheet of which we have spoken was  brought about by a great elevation of the land, accompanied by a change  to intense cold. This led to the formation of enormous masses of ice  heaped up so high that they presently collapsed and moved of their own  weight from the elevated land of the north where they had been formed.  Later on, the northern continent subsided again and the ice sheet  disappeared, but left behind it an entirely different level and a  different climate from those of the earlier ages. The evidence of the  later movements of the land surface, and its rise and fall after the  close of the glacial epoch, may still easily be traced. At a certain  time after the Ice Age, the surface sank so low that land which has  since been lifted up again to a considerable height was once the beach  of the ancient ocean. These beaches are readily distinguished by the  great quantities of sea shells that lie about, often far distant from  the present sea. Thus at Nachvak in Labrador there is a beach fifteen  hundred feet above the ocean. Probably in this period after the Ice Age  the shores of Eastern Canada had sunk so low that the St Lawrence was  not a river at all, but a great gulf or arm of the sea. The ancient  shore can still be traced beside the mountain at Montreal and on the  hillsides round Lake Ontario. Later on again the land rose, the ocean  retreated, and the rushing waters from the shrunken lakes made their  own path to the sea. In their foaming course to the lower level they  tore out the great gorge of Niagara, and tossed and buffeted themselves  over the unyielding ledges of Lachine.    Mighty forces such as these made and fashioned the continent on which  we live.        CHAPTER II    MAN IN AMERICA    It was necessary to form some idea, if only in outline, of the  magnitude and extent of the great geological changes of which we have  just spoken, in order to judge properly the question of the antiquity  and origin of man in America.    When the Europeans came to this continent at the end of the fifteenth  century they found it already inhabited by races of men very different  from themselves. These people, whom they took to calling 'Indians,'  were spread out, though very thinly, from one end of the continent to  the other. Who were these nations, and how was their presence to be  accounted for?    To the first discoverers of America, or rather to the discoverers of  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (Columbus and his successors),  the origin of the Indians presented no difficulty. To them America was  supposed to be simply an outlying part of Eastern Asia, which had been  known by repute and by tradition for centuries past. Finding,  therefore, the tropical islands of the Caribbean sea with a climate and  plants and animals such as they imagined those of Asia and the Indian  ocean to be, and inhabited by men of dusky colour and strange speech,  they naturally thought the place to be part of Asia, or the Indies. The  name 'Indians,' given to the aborigines of North America, records for  us this historical misunderstanding.    But a new view became necessary after Balboa had crossed the isthmus of  Panama and looked out upon the endless waters of the Pacific, and after  Magellan and his Spanish comrades had sailed round the foot of the  continent, and then pressed on across the Pacific to the real Indies.  It was now clear that America was a different region from Asia. Even  then the old error died hard. Long after the Europeans realized that,  at the south, America and Asia were separated by a great sea, they  imagined that these continents were joined together at the north. The  European ideas of distance and of the form of the globe were still  confused and inexact. A party of early explorers in Virginia carried a  letter of introduction with them from the King of England to the Khan  of Tartary: they expected to find him at the head waters of the  Chickahominy. Jacques Cartier, nearly half a century after Columbus,  was expecting that the Gulf of St Lawrence would open out into a  passage leading to China. But after the discovery of the North Pacific  ocean and Bering Strait the idea that America was part of Asia, that  the natives were 'Indians' in the old sense, was seen to be absurd. It  was clear that America was, in a large sense, an island, an island cut  off from every other continent. It then became necessary to find some  explanation for the seemingly isolated position of a portion of mankind  separated from their fellows by boundless oceans.    The earlier theories were certainly naive enough. Since no known human  agency could have transported the Indians across the Atlantic or the  Pacific, their presence in America was accounted for by certain of the  old writers as a particular work of the devil. Thus Cotton Mather, the  famous Puritan clergyman of early New England, maintained in all  seriousness that the devil had inveigled the Indians to America to get  them 'beyond the tinkle of the gospel bells.' Others thought that they  were a washed-up remnant of the great flood. Roger Williams, the  founder of Rhode Island, wrote: 'From Adam and Noah that they spring,  it is granted on all hands.' Even more fantastic views were advanced.  As late as in 1828 a London clergyman wrote a book which he called 'A  View of the American Indians,' which was intended to 'show them to be  the descendants of the ten tribes of Israel.'    Even when such ideas as these were set aside, historians endeavoured to  find evidence, or at least probability, of a migration of the Indians  from the known continents across one or the other of the oceans. It  must be admitted that, even if we supposed the form and extent of the  continents to have been always the same as they are now, such a  migration would have been entirely possible. It is quite likely that  under the influence of exceptional weather--winds blowing week after  week from the same point of the compass--even a primitive craft of  prehistoric times might have been driven across the Atlantic or the  Pacific, and might have landed its occupants still alive and well on  the shores of America. To prove this we need only remember that history  records many such voyages. It has often happened that Japanese junks  have been blown clear across the Pacific. In 1833 a ship of this sort  was driven in a great storm from Japan to the shores of the Queen  Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia. In the same way a  fishing smack from Formosa, which lies off the east coast of China, was  once carried in safety across the ocean to the Sandwich Islands.  Similar long voyages have been made by the natives of the South Seas  against their will, under the influence of strong and continuous winds,  and in craft no better than their open canoes. Captain Beechey of the  Royal Navy relates that in one of his voyages in the Pacific he picked  up a canoe filled with natives from Tahiti who had been driven by a  gale of westerly wind six hundred miles from their own island. It has  happened, too, from time to time, since the discovery of America, that  ships have been forcibly carried all the way across the Atlantic. A  glance at the map of the world shows us that the eastern coast of  Brazil juts out into the South Atlantic so far that it is only fifteen  hundred miles distant from the similar projection of Africa towards the  west. The direction of the trade winds in the South Atlantic is such  that it has often been the practice of sailing vessels bound from  England to South Africa to run clear across the ocean on a long stretch  till within sight of the coast of Brazil before turning towards the  Cape of Good Hope. All, however, that we can deduce from accidental  voyages, like that of the Spaniard, Alvarez de Cabral, across the ocean  is that even if there had been no other way for mankind to reach  America they could have landed there by ship from the Old World. In  such a case, of course, the coming of man to the American continent  would have been an extremely recent event in the long history of the  world. It could not have occurred until mankind had progressed far  enough to make vessels, or at least boats of a simple kind.    But there is evidence that man had appeared on the earth long before  the shaping of the continents had taken place. Both in Europe and  America the buried traces of primitive man are vast in antiquity, and  carry us much further back in time than the final changes of earth and  ocean which made the continents as they are; and, when we remember  this, it is easy to see how mankind could have passed from Asia or  Europe to America. The connection of the land surface of the globe was  different in early times from what it is to-day. Even still, Siberia  and Alaska are separated only by the narrow Bering Strait. From the  shore of Asia the continent of North America is plainly visible; the  islands which lie in and below the strait still look like  stepping-stones from continent to continent. And, apart from this, it  may well have been that farther south, where now is the Pacific ocean,  there was formerly direct land connection between Southern Asia and  South America.

One of these  days, we shall have Arthur playing Charles Peace to a cheering  house.\"    \"It is the tribute,\" said Mifflin, \"that bone-headedness pays to  brains. It takes brains to be a successful cracksman. Unless the  gray matter is surging about in your cerebrum, as in mine, you can't  hope--\"    Jimmy leaned back in his chair, and spoke calmly but with decision.    \"Any man of ordinary intelligence,\" he said, \"could break into a  house.\"    Mifflin jumped up and began to gesticulate. This was heresy.    \"My good man, what absolute--\"    \"_I_ could,\" said Jimmy, lighting a cigarette.    There was a roar of laughter and approval. For the past few weeks,  during the rehearsals of \"Love, the Cracksman,\" Arthur Mifflin had  disturbed the peace at the Strollers' with his theories on the art  of burglary. This was his first really big part, and he had soaked  himself in it. He had read up the literature of burglary. He had  talked with men from Pinkerton's. He had expounded his views nightly  to his brother Strollers, preaching the delicacy and difficulty of  cracking a crib till his audience had rebelled. It charmed the  Strollers to find Jimmy, obviously of his own initiative and not to  be suspected of having been suborned to the task by themselves,  treading with a firm foot on the expert's favorite corn within five  minutes of their meeting.    \"You!\" said Arthur Mifflin, with scorn.    \"I!\"    \"You! Why, you couldn't break into an egg unless it was a poached  one.\"    \"What'll you bet?\" said Jimmy.    The Strollers began to sit up and take notice. The magic word \"bet,\"  when uttered in that room, had rarely failed to add a zest to life.  They looked expectantly at Arthur Mifflin.    \"Go to bed, Jimmy,\" said the portrayer of cracksmen. \"I'll come with  you and tuck you in. A nice, strong cup of tea in the morning, and  you won't know there has ever been anything the matter with you.\"    A howl of disapproval rose from the company. Indignant voices  accused Arthur Mifflin of having a yellow streak. Encouraging voices  urged him not to be a quitter.    \"See! They scorn you,\" said Jimmy. \"And rightly. Be a man, Arthur.  What'll you bet?\"    Mr. Mifflin regarded him with pity.    \"You don't know what you're up against, Jimmy,\" he said. \"You're  half a century behind the times. You have an idea that all a burglar  needs is a mask, a blue chin, and a dark lantern. I tell you he  requires a highly specialized education. I've been talking to these  detective fellows, and I know. Now, take your case, you worm. Have  you a thorough knowledge of chemistry, physics, toxicology--\"    \"Sure.\"    \"--electricity and microscopy?\"    \"You have discovered my secret.\"    \"Can you use an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe?\"    \"I never travel without one.\"    \"What do you know about the administration of anaesthetics?\"    \"Practically everything. It is one of my favorite hobbies.\"    \"Can you make 'soup'?\"    \"Soup?\"    \"Soup,\" said Mr. Mifflin, firmly.    Jimmy raised his eyebrows.    \"Does an architect make bricks?\" he said. \"I leave the rough  preliminary work to my corps of assistants. They make my soup.\"    \"You mustn't think Jimmy's one of your common yeggs,\" said Sutton.  \"He's at the top of his profession. That's how he made his money. I  never did believe that legacy story.\"    \"Jimmy,\" said Mr. Mifflin, \"couldn't crack a child's money-box.  Jimmy couldn't open a sardine-tin.\"    Jimmy shrugged his shoulders.    \"What'll you bet?\" he said again. \"Come on, Arthur; you're earning a  very good salary. What'll you bet?\"    \"Make it a dinner for all present,\" suggested Raikes, a canny person  who believed in turning the wayside happenings of life, when  possible, to his personal profit.    The suggestion was well received.    \"All right,\" said Mifflin. \"How many of us are there? One, two,  three, four--Loser buys a dinner for twelve.\"    \"A good dinner,\" interpolated Raikes, softly.    \"A good dinner,\" said Jimmy. \"Very well. How long do you give me,  Arthur?\"    \"How long do you want?\"    \"There ought to be a time-limit,\" said Raikes. \"It seems to me that  a flyer like Jimmy ought to be able to manage it at short notice.  Why not tonight? Nice, fine night. If Jimmy doesn't crack a crib  tonight, it's up to him. That suit you, Jimmy?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    Willett interposed. Willett had been endeavoring to drown his  sorrows all the evening, and the fact was a little noticeable in his  speech.    \"See here,\" he said, \"how's J-Jimmy going to prove he's done it?\"    \"Personally, I can take his word,\" said Mifflin.    \"That be h-hanged for a tale. Wha-what's to prevent him saying he's  done it, whether he has or not?\"    The Strollers looked uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it was Jimmy's  affair.    \"Why, you'd get your dinner in any case,\" said Jimmy. \"A dinner from  any host would smell as sweet.\"    Willett persisted with muddled obstinacy.    \"Thash--thash not point. It's principle of thing. Have thish thing  square and 'bove board, _I_ say. Thash what _I_ say.\"    \"And very creditable to you being able to say it,\" said Jimmy,  cordially. \"See if you can manage 'Truly rural'.\"    \"What _I_ say is--this! Jimmy's a fakir. And what I say is what's  prevent him saying he's done it when hasn't done it?\"    \"That'll be all right,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm going to bury a brass tube  with the Stars and Stripes in it under the carpet.\"    Willett waved his hand.    \"Thash quite sh'factory,\" he said, with dignity. \"Nothing more to  say.\"    \"Or a better idea,\" said Jimmy. \"I'll carve a big J on the inside of  the front door. Then, anybody who likes can make inquiries next day.  Well, I'm off home. Glad it's all settled. Anybody coming my way?\"    \"Yes,\" said Arthur Mifflin. \"We'll walk. First nights always make me  as jumpy as a cat. If I don't walk my legs off, I shan't get to  sleep tonight at all.\"    \"If you think I'm going to help you walk your legs off, my lad,  you're mistaken. I propose to stroll gently home, and go to bed.\"    \"Every little helps,\" said Mifflin. \"Come along.\"    \"You want to keep an eye on Jimmy, Arthur,\" said Sutton. \"He'll  sand-bag you, and lift your watch as soon as look at you. I believe  he's Arsene Lupin in disguise.\"          CHAPTER II    PYRAMUS AND THISBE      The two men turned up the street. They walked in silence. Arthur  Mifflin was going over in his mind such outstanding events of the  evening as he remembered--the nervousness, the relief of finding  that he was gripping his audience, the growing conviction that he  had made good; while Jimmy seemed to be thinking his own private  thoughts. They had gone some distance before either spoke.    \"Who is she, Jimmy?\" asked Mifflin.    Jimmy came out of his thoughts with a start.    \"What's that?\"    \"Who is she?\"    \"I don't know what you mean.\"    \"Yes, you do! The sea air. Who is she?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Jimmy, simply.    \"You don't know? Well, what's her name?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Doesn't the Lusitania still print a passenger-list?\"    \"She does.\"    \"And you couldn't find out her name in five days?\"    \"No.\"    \"And that's the man who thinks he can burgle a house!\" said Mifflin,  despairingly.    They had arrived now at the building on the second floor of which  was Jimmy's flat.    \"Coming in?\" said Jimmy.    \"Well, I was rather thinking of pushing on as far as the Park. I  tell you, I feel all on wires.\"    \"Come in, and smoke a cigar. You've got all night before you if you  want to do Marathons. I haven't seen you for a couple of months. I  want you to tell me all the news.\"    \"There isn't any. Nothing happens in New York. The papers say things  do, but they don't. However, I'll come in. It seems to me that  you're the man with the news.\"    Jimmy fumbled with his latch-key.    \"You're a bright sort of burglar,\" said Mifflin, disparagingly. \"Why  don't you use your oxy-acetylene blow-pipe? Do you realize, my boy,  that you've let yourself in for buying a dinner for twelve hungry  men next week? In the cold light of the morning, when reason returns  to her throne, that'll come home to you.\"    \"I haven't done anything of the sort,\" said Jimmy, unlocking the  door.    \"Don't tell me you really mean to try it.\"    \"What else did you think I was going to do?\"    \"But you can't. You would get caught for a certainty. And what are  you going to do then? Say it was all a joke? Suppose they fill you  full of bullet-holes! Nice sort of fool you'll look, appealing to  some outraged householder's sense of humor, while he pumps you full  of lead with a Colt.\"    \"These are the risks of the profession. You ought to know that,  Arthur. Think what you went through tonight.\"    Arthur Mifflin looked at his friend with some uneasiness. He knew  how very reckless Jimmy could be when he had set his mind on  accomplishing anything, since, under the stimulus of a challenge, he  ceased to be a reasoning being, amenable to argument. And, in the  present case, he knew that Willett's words had driven the challenge  home. Jimmy was not the man to sit still under the charge of being a  fakir, no matter whether his accuser had been sober or drunk.    Jimmy, meanwhile, had produced whiskey and cigars. Now, he was lying  on his back on the lounge, blowing smoke-rings at the ceiling.    \"Well?\" said Arthur Mifflin, at length.    \"Well, what?\"    \"What I meant was, is this silence to be permanent, or are you going  to begin shortly to amuse, elevate, and instruct? Something's  happened to you, Jimmy. There was a time when you were a bright  little chap, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.  Where be your gibes now; your gambols, your songs, your flashes of  merriment that were wont to set the table in a roar when you were  paying for the dinner? You remind me more of a deaf-mute celebrating  the Fourth of July with noiseless powder than anything else on  earth. Wake up, or I shall go. Jimmy, we were "]]]
