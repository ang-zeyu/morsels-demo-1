And it is Bruce who has held to the idea ever  since and sought any opportunity that offered of getting at the  mountain.    It stands to reason that men with any zest for mountaineering could not  possibly allow Mount Everest to remain untouched. The time, the  opportunity, the money, the ability to make the necessary preliminary  preparation might be lacking, but the wish and the will to stand on the  summit of the world's highest mountain must have been in the heart of  many a mountaineer since the Alps have been so firmly trampled under  foot. The higher climbers climb, the higher they want to climb. It is  certain that they will never rest content till the proudest peaks of the  Himalaya are as subdued and tamed as the once dreaded summits of the  Alps now are.    Men simply cannot resist exercising and stretching to their fullest  tether the faculties and aptitudes with which they each happen to be  specially endowed. One born with an aptitude for painting is dull and  morose and fidgety until he can get colours and a brush into his hand  and commence painting. Another is itching to make things--to use his  hands and fashion wood or stone or metal into forms which he is  continually creating in his mind. Another is restless until he can sing.  Another is ever pining to be on a public platform swaying the audience  with his oratory and playing on their feelings as on a musical  instrument. Each has his own inner aptitude which he aches to give vent  to and bring into play. And more than this, he secretly owns within  himself an exceedingly high standard--the highest standard--of what he  wants to attain to along his own particular line, and he is never really  content in his mind and at peace with himself when he is not stretching  himself out to the full towards this high pinnacle which he has set  before him.    Now fortunately all men are not born with the same aptitudes. We do not  all want to sing or all want to orate or all want to paint. Some few  want to climb mountains. These men love to pit themselves against what  most others would consider an insuperable obstacle. They enjoy measuring  themselves against it and being forced to exercise all their energies  and faculties to overcome it. The Duke of the Abruzzi is as good an  example of this type as I know. He was never happy until he had  discovered some inaccessible and impracticable mountain and then thrown  himself against it and come to grips with it in dead earnest and either  conquered it or been thrown back from it utterly and completely  exhausted, but with the satisfaction that anyhow he had exercised every  nerve and muscle and faculty to the full. His native mountains he had  early conquered over and over again, so he had to look further afield to  Mount Elias in Alaska and Ruwenzori in East Africa; and having  vanquished these he would doubtless have turned his eyes to Mount  Everest if for political reasons the way to that mountain had not been  barred, and he was compelled therefore to look to the next highest  mountain, namely, the peak K2 in the Karakoram Himalaya in the  neighbourhood of which he attained to a greater height, 24,600 feet,  than has yet been attained by any man on foot.    The Duke no doubt is human and would like his name to go down to  posterity as having conquered some conspicuously lofty and difficult  peak. But undoubtedly the ruling passion with him would be this love of  pitting himself against a great mountain and feeling that he was being  forced to exert himself to the full. To such men a tussle with a  mountain is a real tonic--something bracing and refreshing. And even if  they are laid out flat by the mountain instead of standing triumphant on  its summit they have enjoyed the struggle and would go back for another  if they ever had the chance.    Others--like Bruce--climb from sheer exuberance of spirits. Blessed with  boundless energy they revel in its exercise. It is only on the mountain  side, breathing its pure air, buffeting against its storms, testing  their nerve, running hair-breadth risks, exercising their intelligence  and judgment, feeling their manhood and looking on Nature face to face  and with open heart and mind that they are truly happy. For these men  days on the mountain are days when they really live. And as the cobwebs  in their brains get blown away, as the blood begins to course  refreshingly through their veins, as all their faculties become tuned up  and their whole being becomes more sensitive, they detect appeals from  Nature they had never heard before and see beauties which are revealed  only to those who win them. They may not at the moment be aware of the  deepest impressions they are receiving. But to those who have struggled  with them the mountains reveal beauties they will not disclose to those  who make no effort. That is the reward the mountains give to effort. And  it is because they have much to give and give it so lavishly to those  who will wrestle with them that men love the mountains and go back to  them again and again.    And naturally the mountains reserve their choicest gifts for those who  stand upon their summits. The climber's vision is then no longer  confined and enclosed. He can see now all round. His width of outlook is  enlarged to its full extremity. He sees in every direction. He has a  sense of being raised above the world and being proudly conscious that  he has raised himself there by his own exertions, he has a peculiar  satisfaction and for the time forgets all frets and worries in the  serener atmosphere in which he now for a moment dwells.    And it is only for a moment that he can dwell there. For men cannot  always live on the heights. They must come down to the plains again and  engage in the practical life of the world. But the vision from the  heights never leaves them. They want to return there. They want to reach  a higher height. Their standard of achievement rises. And so it has come  about that mountaineers when they had climbed the highest heights in  Europe went off to the Caucasus, to the Andes, and eventually to the  Himalaya to climb something higher still. Freshfield conquered the  Caucasus, Whymper and Conway the Andes, and the assault upon the  Himalaya is now in full swing.    It is therefore only in the natural course of things that men should  want to climb the highest summit of the Himalaya. And though those who  set out to climb Mount Everest will probably think little of the  eventual results, being perfectly satisfied in their own minds, without  any elaborate reasoning, that what they are attempting is something  supremely worth while, yet it is easy for lookers on to see that much  unexpected good will result from their activities. The climbers will be  actuated by sheer love of mountaineering, and that is enough for them.  But climbing Mount Everest is no futile and useless performance of no  satisfaction to anyone but the climbers. Results will follow from it of  the highest value to mankind at large.    For the climbers are unwittingly carrying out an experiment of momentous  consequence to mankind. They are testing the capacity of the human race  to stand the highest altitudes on this earth which is its home. No  scientific man, no physiologist or physician, can now say for certain  whether or not a human body can reach a height of 29,000 feet above the  sea. We know that in an aeroplane he can be carried up to a much greater  height. But we do not know whether he can climb on his own feet such an  altitude. That knowledge of men's capacity can only be acquired by  practical experiment in the field.    And in the process of acquiring the knowledge a valuable result will  ensue. By testing their capacities men actually increase them. By  exercising their capacities to the full mountaineers seem to enlarge  them. A century ago the ascent of Mount Blanc seemed the limit of human  capacity. Nowadays hundreds ascend the mountain every year. And going  further afield men ascended the highest peaks in the Caucasus and then  in the Andes and have been reaching higher and higher altitudes in the  Himalaya. Conway reached 23,000 feet, Kellas 23,186 feet, Longstaff  23,360 feet, Dr. Workman 23,000 feet, Kellas and Meade 23,600 feet and  the Duke of the Abruzzi 24,600 feet. It looks therefore as if man by  attempting more was actually making himself capable of achieving more.  By straining after the highest he is increasing his capacity to attain  it.    In this measuring of themselves against the mountains men are indeed  very like puppies crawling about and testing their capacities on their  surroundings--crawling up on to some obstacle, tumbling back discomfited  but returning gallantly to the attack and at last triumphantly  surmounting it. Thus do they find out what they can do and how they  stand in relation to their surroundings. Also by exercising and  stretching their muscles and faculties to the full they actually  increase their capacity.    Men are still only in the puppy stage of existence. We are prone to  think ourselves very \"grown up\" but really we are only in our childhood.  In the latest discussions as to the period of time which must have  elapsed since life first appeared upon this earth a period of the order  of a thousand million years was named. But of that immense period man  has been in existence for only a quarter or half a million years. So the  probability is that he has still long years before him and must be now  only in his childhood--in his puppyhood. We certainly find that as he  inquisitively looks about his surroundings and measures himself against  them he is steadily increasing his mastery over them. In the last five  hundred years record after record has been beaten. Men have ventured  more and shown more adaptability and a sterner hardihood and endurance  than ever before. They have ventured across the oceans,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#2)"],[1,"Humboldt--Scarcity of Game--Terrible       Sufferings--The Horrors of Thirst and Famine--Eating Ants, Crickets       and Mules--Return to Snake River--A lucky Discovery--A Trout       Supper--The Country of the Diggers--Some Account of Them--Anecdote       of Wyeth and Meek--Comparison of Indian Tribes--The Blackfeet--The       Crows--The Coast Tribes and the Mountain Tribes--The Columbia River       Indians--Their Habits, Customs, and Dress--Indian Commerce--The       Indians of the Plains--Their Dress, Manners, and Wealth--The Horses       of the Plains--Language--The Indian's Moral Nature--Hungry and       Hospitable Savages--A Trap set for a Rival--An Ambush--Death of       Vanderburg--Skirmish with Blackfeet--The Woman Interpreter taken       Prisoner--Bravery of her Husband--Happy Finale--Meek Rescues the       \"Mountain Lamb\"--Intense Cold--Threatened by Famine--The Den of       Grizzlys--Second Daniels,      119      CHAPTER VIII.
