Their efforts in behalf of Don Guillermo never will  be forgotten; I extend an especially hearty _muchas gracias_ to  Benjamin, Ignacio, Jesus, Lorenzo, Mariano, and Remigio.    Much of the work on this report was done while I was associated with the  Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan. I thank Norman E.  Hartweg and T. H. Hubbell for making available to me the facilities of  the museum and for their numerous courtesies that aided me so much.    My field work in Michoacan was supported by the Museum of Zoology at the  University of Michigan (1951), by the Horace H. Rackham School of  Graduate Studies of the University of Michigan (1955), by the Penrose  Fund of the American Philosophical Society (1956), by the Bache Fund of  the National Academy of Sciences (1958), and by the University of Kansas  Endowment Association (1960).    Permits for collecting specimens in Mexico were provided by the  Direccion General de Caza through the courtesy of Ing. Juan Lozano  Franco and Luis Macias Arellano.      Historical Account    Unlike many parts of southern Mexico and northern Central America,  Michoacan received no attention from the collecting expeditions of the  European museums in the last century. The earliest known herpetological  specimens from Michoacan were obtained by Louis John Xantus, who was  appointed U. S. Consul to Colima in 1859. In April, 1863, Xantus  collected at Volcan Jorullo in Michoacan; in April and May of the same  year he collected along the coast of Michoacan between the Rio Cachan  and the Rio Nexpa. His small collection of 19 extant specimens is in the  United States National Museum. Alfredo Duges, a resident of Guanajuato,  Mexico, made early contributions to the knowledge of the herpetofauna of  Michoacan. In 1885 he described _Sonora michoacanensis_, and in 1891 he  described _Eumeces altamirani_; from what is known of the distribution  of these species, he probably had collected in the Tepalcatepec Valley.  During their biological survey of Mexico, Edward W. Nelson and Edward A.  Goldman spent a limited amount of time in Michoacan in 1892 and again in  1903 and 1904. Most of their collecting was done on the plateau in the  north-central part of the state; their collections are in the United  States National Museum. While collecting fishes in southern Mexico, Seth  E. Meek obtained some amphibians and reptiles from Lago de Patzcuaro in  1904; these are in the collections of the Chicago Natural History  Museum. In 1908 Hans Gadow ventured into the then unexplored \"tierra  caliente\" of the Balsas Valley and collected at Volcan Jorullo and other  localities in the valley. Later in the same year he collected at  Guayabo, San Salvador, and Arteaga in the Sierra de Coalcoman and at  Buena Vista and Cofradia in the Tepalcatepec Valley. His collections  were deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) and the  Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.    The first thirty years of the present century saw little more field work  in Michoacan. In the 1930's Edward H. Taylor and Hobart M. Smith  collected throughout much of Mexico. At various times they worked in  Michoacan, principally along the road from Mexico City to Guadalajara.  In 1935 Hobart M. Smith spent a week at Hacienda El Sabino south of  Uruapan; he revisited the locality again in 1936 and made a large and  important collection of amphibians and reptiles from the upper limits of  the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Specimens  collected by Smith and Taylor were incorporated into the Edward H.  Taylor-Hobart M. Smith collection, which subsequently was deposited in  part in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Illinois and  in part in the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1939 Hobart M. Smith  collected at Patzcuaro and between Uruapan and Apatzingan; these  collections, made while he was a Walter Rathbone Bacon Scholar of the  Smithsonian Institution, are deposited in the United States National  Museum. In 1940 and 1941 Frederick A. Shannon, who was a member of the  Hoogstraal Expeditions under the auspices of the Chicago Natural History  Museum, collected on Cerro de Tancitaro and at Apatzingan; an account of  the specimens collected there was published by Schmidt and Shannon  (1947).    The eruption of Volcan Paricutin in February, 1943, attracted the  attention of many biologists, a group of which from the Museum of  Zoology at the University of Michigan collected in the Cordillera  Volcanica in 1945 and 1947. The amphibians and reptiles were collected  and studied by Norman E. Hartweg. In 1950 James A. Peters accompanied  Donald D. Brand on a preliminary exploration of the western part of the  Sierra de Coalcoman and adjacent Pacific coast of Michoacan; in the same  year Peters collected also on the Mexican Plateau and at Volcan Jorullo.  His specimens are in the Museum of Zoology at the University of  Michigan. Since 1950 many biologists have collected in Michoacan in the  course of work on certain groups of animals or in general surveys. In  this way Raymond Alcorn, Robert W. Dickerman, James R. Dixon, Floyd L.  Downs, Emmet T. Hooper, and Robert R. Miller have contributed to our  knowledge of the herpetofauna.    As stated previously, my own field work in Michoacan began in 1951, when  I accompanied Donald D. Brand on an exploring expedition to the  southern part of the state. In that year a short time was spent on the  Mexican Plateau, principally in the area around Lago de Cuitzeo, and at  Volcan Jorullo. In July and August we made our headquarters at  Coalcoman. From that town the field party travelled southward to Maruata  on the Pacific coast and thence back over the mountains to Coalcoman.  Later in that summer we travelled by mule from Coalcoman southeastward  to the mouth of the Rio Nexpa. In 1955, accompanied by Lee D. Beatty,  Carter R. Gilbert, and Fred G. Thompson, I collected in the Tepalcatepec  Valley and at Coalcoman. We made a mule trip from Coalcoman to Cerro de  Barolosa, where we made the first collections from the pine-fir forests  in the Sierra de Coalcoman. Later in the same summer Carter R. Gilbert  and I spent a week at Playa Azul on the Pacific coast. In March, April,  and May, 1956, my wife and I collected for a short time in the  Cordillera Volcanica and on the Mexican Plateau. In early April we moved  into the Tepalcatepec Valley, where we collected intensively between  Churumuco and Tepalcatepec. In May we collected on the Pacific coast  between Boca de Apiza and La Placita. In July and August, 1956,  accompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we returned to Michoacan and again  collected on the Mexican Plateau and in the Cordillera Volcanica, before  moving into the Tepalcatepec Valley. In an attempt to fill in gaps in  the known distributions of many species and to sample the fauna in some  previously uncollected areas, I returned to Michoacan in June, 1958.  Accompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John Wellman, I collected on the  Mexican Plateau in the northwestern part of the state, on the southern  slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica, and in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Most  of our time was spent in the Sierra de Coalcoman, where we collected at  Aguililla, Artega, and Dos Aguas. In 1960 two days were spent in  Michoacan; a small collection was made in the eastern part of the  Cordillera Volcanica. With the exception of the specimens collected in  1960, which are at the Museum of Natural History at the University of  Kansas, the specimens that I have collected in Michoacan are in the  Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan.          NATURAL LANDSCAPE      A proper understanding of the geographical distribution of animals in a  given region is possible only after a thorough acquaintance with the  geography of the region. Likewise, in order to gain a knowledge of the  ecological distribution and relationships of the components of the  fauna, it is necessary to study the animals in their natural  environments. In order to give the reader a picture of the physical  features and the major animal habitats within the state of Michoacan,  the following brief description is offered. Each of these facets  mentioned below will be elaborated in detail in my final report on the  herpetofauna of Michoacan.      Physiography    The state of Michoacan comprises an area of 60,093 square kilometers  (Vivo, 1953). Within this area the rugged terrain has a total relief of  nearly 4000 meters. There have been several attempts to classify the  physiographic provinces of Mexico; the classification used here is a  slight modification of the scheme proposed by Tamayo (1949). I have  tried to keep the system as simple as possible, but still useful in  discussing the distribution of animals living in the region. For general  purposes the state of Michoacan can be divided into lowlands and  highlands as follows:        LOWLANDS        Pacific Coastal Plain        Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin        HIGHLANDS        Mexican Plateau        Cordillera Volcanica        Sierra de Coalcoman    Although the lowlands in the state are continuous, they are only  narrowly connected and thus form two distinct physiographic and biotic  areas. The Pacific Coastal Plain in Michoacan extends for a distance of  about 200 kilometers (airline) from the Rio Coahuayana to the Rio  Balsas. The coastal plain is broad between the Rio Coahuayana and San  Juan de Lima, and between Las Penas and the Rio Balsas, where the hills  rise some 12 kilometers inland from the sea. Between San Juan de Lima  and Las Penas the mountains extend to the sea; in this region rocky  promontories form precipitous cliffs dropping into the sea. Between the  promontories are small sandy or rocky beaches.    Lying to the north of the Sierra de Coalcoman and the Sierra del Sur,  but south of the Cordillera Volcanica, is a broad structural depression,  the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin.

In 1948 there were many houses in cut tops of trees left from small  scale lumbering operations a few years earlier. The densely branched  tops of elms, oaks and hickories had satisfied the requirement for  support of the house and nearby shelter. The houses built in them were  in open woodland well separated from otherwise favorable situations. By  1948 the tops were disintegrating and no longer provided effective  shelter. The houses built in them were falling into disrepair and were  not permanently inhabited but were often used temporarily by wandering  individuals.    Along cut banks of gullies where trees were partly undermined by  erosion, the exposed, tangled root systems provided sites for occupancy.  In these situations the accumulations of sticks were small and lacked  the typical domed shape, consisting essentially of a lining to the  cavity beneath the roots.    Two small buildings at the Reservation headquarters were accessible to  woodrats and were utilized off and on throughout much of the period of  this study, despite the fact that most other sites of occupation away  from the hilltop outcrops were deserted in the same period. One small  building used as a laboratory had an enclosed wooden box five feet  square housing an electric water pump. The interior of this box was  accessible to the rats from beneath the floor. Litter of sticks and  stems and various food materials were carried in by the rats. The nest  thus protected and enclosed was not surrounded by the usual accumulation  of sticks. An old garage 30 feet from the laboratory building was also  occupied, sometimes by a different individual. The nest and food stores  were behind boards propped against the wall.    In October, 1948, live-trapping was begun on a heavily wooded slope  facing northwest, and a ten-acre area was trapped rather thoroughly in  the succeeding weeks. Because few traps were then available, this was  the only area that was well sampled in 1948, although diffuse trapping  was carried on over some 200 acres. On the ten-acre tract a total of 17  adult and subadult woodrats were caught, four along the hilltop rock  outcrop, six along the gully at the bottom of the slope, and seven at  intermediate levels on the slope. Judging from the many unoccupied  houses, the population on this tract had been much higher before the  study was begun. On the basis of this sample it seems that in 1947 a  population of several hundred woodrats lived on the wooded parts of the  square mile where the Reservation is located.      _Reduction of Population_    The abrupt reduction in the population of woodrats on the Reservation  cannot be explained conclusively with available data. Probably weather  played a major part, but other unknown factors must have been important  also. It is certain that the population of woodrats was high, if not at  an all-time peak, in 1947. In late February, 1948, when one of us  (Fitch) first visited the area on a preliminary inspection trip (not  concerned primarily with woodrats), houses of these rats were found to  be unusually numerous and those seen seemed to be occupied and well  repaired. Possibly the population was drastically reduced within the  next few weeks, as unseasonably cold and stormy weather occurred in  early March. For the first 12 days of March, 1948, temperature averaged  20 deg. below that of average March weather, and even colder than the  average for January or February. A reading of -5 deg.F. on March 11 set a  new low locally for the month since records were begun in 1869. The  record low temperatures were accompanied by 12.8 inches of snow. This  spell of unusually severe weather in early March coincided with the  period in which first litters of young usually are born, as most females  breed in early February and the gestation period is in the neighborhood  of five weeks. That most of these first-litter young may have been  eliminated by the unfavorable extreme of weather at the most critical  stage in the life cycle may be readily imagined although definite proof  is lacking. However, the mortality must have extended beyond newborn  young. Loss of first litters ordinarily would be compensated for by the  end of the season, since a female usually breeds more than once in the  course of a season. In any case, by autumn, when the actual field study  of woodrats was initiated, many houses were already deserted and in  disrepair. Although the rats were still moderately abundant, they were,  seemingly, much below the population peak of the preceding year.    Further drastic reduction of adults and subadults took place in the  winter of 1948-49. In the course of live-trapping operations from  mid-October into early December, 51 individuals were caught and marked.  Chiefly because of unfavorable weather conditions, field work was  discontinued in mid-December, and live-trapping was not resumed until  early March. Subsequently, only 12 of the woodrats previously marked  could be recaptured, and the population had become noticeably sparse.  Seemingly, more than three-fourths of the population present in late  autumn had been eliminated in the interval. In January, weather was  exceptionally severe; on the ninth and tenth the worst sleet storm in  twelve years occurred. Sleet fell in small granules, while the  temperature remained several degrees below freezing. Partial thawing on  January 12, 13 and 14 was followed by a steady drizzling rain on the  fifteenth. On the following day the temperature dropped to -7 deg.F. Ice  still remained from the sleet storm, and the slush again froze. On the  night of January 18, there was one of the worst snow storms on record  and temperature reached a low of 2 deg.F. Exceptionally low temperatures  persisted through January 24, with more sleet on January 25. Ice from  the earlier storm still remained. On January 30, the temperature dropped  to -7 deg. and a three-inch cover of snow still remained over the coat of  ice. The month of January, 1949, had the heaviest precipitation in 81  years (5.09 inches) and a cover of ice remained for at least 21 days.  There were other sleet storms of lesser proportions on February 2 and  again on February 21.    Ordinarily sleet would not seriously damage woodrats living in houses in  woodland habitats and less suitable hedge rows because it usually  freezes as it falls and coats only the surface of the house. Gradual  thawing would allow normal runoff without much penetration. Because the  sleet during the storm described above did not form a glaze as it fell,  the ice particles penetrated many houses. It has been observed many  times that captive woodrats refused food that was frozen or were unable  to eat it. Woodrats in live-traps in winter rapidly weaken unless a  large supply of food is available. If food supplies became sealed over  by ice, woodrats would have died by starvation or by falling an easy  prey to predators. The rats were more accessible to several predators  than were smaller mammals such as meadow voles which were difficult to  obtain because of the coating of ice over the fields.    The decimated population surviving into the breeding season of 1949  failed to make substantial gains. In fact, during the following  four-year period the general trend of the population over the  Reservation as a whole seemed to be one of gradual further decline.    In November, 1949, the rats were almost gone from the area of north  slope and hilltop in oak-hickory-elm woodland where the most intensive  live-trapping and other field work had been done the previous year. The  following descriptions of houses remaining on the area at that time give  some idea of the habitat, and of the course of events correlated with  the fluctuations in numbers of woodrats.         No. 1. At the hilltop outcrop, partly on a substrate of       limestone boulders, built around an elm of two-foot DBH,       which lent support to one side. A hackberry sapling one inch       in stem diameter grew through the middle of the house,       providing further support. The house was two feet high and       six feet in diameter, and was in obvious disrepair, with a       hole several inches in diameter in its top. It had been       occupied in the autumn of 1948. It was constructed mainly of       sticks, ranging in diameter from approximately one inch to       straw size. Many of the sticks, from .4 to .5 inches in       diameter and one to two feet long, seemingly would have been       heavy burdens for a rat, although they were of light-weight       wood, sumac and elm. Mixed with the sticks were quantities       of dry leaves, bark, and chips of wood, all material       appearing old and weathered. This house was in       elm-oak-hickory woods 50 feet from a cultivated field on the       hilltop to the east and south. To the north and west the       escarpment sloped away abruptly. There was a coralberry       thicket beneath the trees on the adjacent hilltop.
