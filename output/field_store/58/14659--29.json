The various forms of intellectual activity which together make  up the culture of an age, move for the most part from different  starting-points, and by unconnected roads.  As products of the  same generation they partake indeed of a common character, and  unconsciously illustrate each other; but of the producers  themselves, each group is solitary, gaining what advantage or  disadvantage there may be in intellectual isolation.  Art and  poetry, philosophy and the religious life, and that other life of  refined pleasure and action in the conspicuous places of the  world, are each of them confined to its own circle of ideas, and  those who prosecute either of them are generally little [xiv]  curious of the thoughts of others.  There come, however, from  time to time, eras of more favourable conditions, in which the  thoughts of men draw nearer together than is their wont, and the  many interests of the intellectual world combine in one complete  type of general culture.  The fifteenth century in Italy is one of  these happier eras, and what is sometimes said of the age of  Pericles is true of that of Lorenzo:--it is an age productive in  personalities, many-sided, centralised, complete.  Here, artists  and philosophers and those whom the action of the world has  elevated and made keen, do not live in isolation, but breathe a  common air, and catch light and heat from each other's thoughts.  There is a spirit of general elevation and enlightenment in which  all alike communicate.  The unity of this spirit gives unity to all  the various products of the Renaissance; and it is to this intimate  alliance with the mind, this participation in the best thoughts  which that age produced, that the art of Italy in the fifteenth  century owes much of its grave dignity and influence.    I have added an essay on Winckelmann, as not incongruous with  the studies which precede it, because Winckelmann, coming in  the eighteenth century, really belongs in spirit to an earlier age.  By his enthusiasm for the things of the intellect [xv] and the  imagination for their own sake, by his Hellenism, his life-long  struggle to attain the Greek spirit, he is in sympathy with the  humanists of a previous century.  He is the last fruit of the  Renaissance, and explains in a striking way its motive and  tendencies.    1873.        TWO EARLY FRENCH STORIES    Yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove.    [1] THE history of the Renaissance ends in France, and carries us  away from Italy to the beautiful cities of the country of the Loire.  But it was in France also, in a very important sense, that the  Renaissance had begun.  French writers, who are fond of  connecting the creations of Italian genius with a French origin,  who tell us how Saint Francis of Assisi took not his name only,  but all those notions of chivalry and romantic love which so  deeply penetrated his thoughts, from a French source, how  Boccaccio borrowed the outlines of his stories from the old  French fabliaux, and how Dante himself expressly connects the  origin of the art of miniature-painting with the city of Paris, have  often dwelt on this notion of a Renaissance in the end of the  twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century, a Renaissance  within the limits of the middle age itself--a brilliant, but in part  abortive effort to do for human life and the human mind what  was afterwards done in the fifteenth.  The word Renaissance,  indeed, is now generally used to denote not [2] merely the revival  of classical antiquity which took place in the fifteenth century,  and to which the word was first applied, but a whole complex  movement, of which that revival of classical antiquity was but  one element or symptom.  For us the Renaissance is the name of  a many-sided but yet united movement, in which the love of the  things of the intellect and the imagination for their own sake, the  desire for a more liberal and comely way of conceiving life, make  themselves felt, urging those who experience this desire to search  out first one and then another means of intellectual or imaginative  enjoyment, and directing them not only to the discovery of old  and forgotten sources of this enjoyment, but to the divination of  fresh sources thereof--new experiences, new subjects of poetry,  new forms of art.  Of such feeling there was a great outbreak in  the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the following century.  Here and there, under rare and happy conditions, in Pointed  architecture, in the doctrines of romantic love, in the poetry of  Provence, the rude strength of the middle age turns to sweetness;  and the taste for sweetness generated there becomes the seed of  the classical revival in it, prompting it constantly to seek after the  springs of perfect sweetness in the Hellenic world.  And coming  after a long period in which this instinct had been crushed, that  true \"dark age,\" in which so many sources of  intellectual and  imaginative enjoyment had [3] actually disappeared, this  outbreak is rightly called a Renaissance, a revival.    Theories which bring into connexion with each other modes of  thought and feeling, periods of taste, forms of art and poetry,  which the narrowness of men's minds constantly tends to oppose  to each other, have a great stimulus for the intellect, and are  almost always worth understanding.  It is so with this theory of a  Renaissance within the middle age, which seeks to establish a  continuity between the most characteristic work of that period,  the sculpture of Chartres, the windows of Le Mans, and the work  of the later Renaissance, the work of Jean Cousin and Germain  Pilon, thus healing that rupture between the middle age and the  Renaissance which has so often been exaggerated.  But it is not  so much the ecclesiastical art of the middle age, its sculpture and  painting--work certainly done in a great measure for pleasure's  sake, in which even a secular, a rebellious spirit often betrays  itself--but rather its profane poetry, the poetry of Provence, and  the magnificent after-growth of that poetry in Italy and France,  which those French writers have in view when they speak of this  medieval Renaissance.  In that poetry, earthly passion, with its  intimacy, its freedom, its variety--the liberty of the heart--makes  itself felt; and the name of Abelard, the great scholar and the  great lover, connects the expression of this liberty of heart with  the free [4] play of human intelligence around all subjects  presented to it, with the liberty of the intellect, as that age  understood it.    Every one knows the legend of Abelard, a legend hardly less  passionate, certainly not less characteristic of the middle age,  than the legend of Tannhäuser; how the famous and comely  clerk, in whom Wisdom herself, self-possessed, pleasant, and  discreet, seemed to sit enthroned, came to live in the house of a  canon of the church of Notre-Dame, where dwelt a girl, Heloïse,  believed to be the old priest's orphan niece; how the old priest  had testified his love for her by giving her an education then  unrivalled, so that rumour asserted that, through the knowledge  of languages, enabling her to penetrate into the mysteries of the  older world, she had become a sorceress, like the Celtic  druidesses; and how as Abelard and Heloïse sat together at home  there, to refine a little further on the nature of abstract ideas,  \"Love made himself of the party with them.\"  You conceive the  temptations of the scholar, who, in such dreamy tranquillity, amid  the bright and busy spectacle of the \"Island,\" lived in a world of  something like shadows; and that for one who knew so well how  to assign its exact value to every abstract thought, those restraints  which lie on the consciences of other men had been relaxed.  It  appears that he composed many verses in the vulgar tongue:  already the young men sang them on the quay below the house.  Those songs, says M. de Rémusat, [5] were probably in the taste  of the Trouvères, \"of whom he was one of the first in date, or, so  to speak, the predecessor.\"  It is the same spirit which has  moulded the famous \"letters,\" written in the quaint Latin of the  middle age.    At the foot of that early Gothic tower, which the next generation  raised to grace the precincts of Abelard's school, on the  \"Mountain of Saint Geneviève,\" the historian Michelet sees in  thought \"a terrible assembly; not the hearers of Abelard alone,  fifty bishops, twenty cardinals, two popes, the whole body of  scholastic philosophy; not only the learned Heloïse, the teaching  of languages, and the Renaissance; but Arnold of Brescia--that is  to say, the revolution.\"  And so from the rooms of this shadowy  house by the Seine side we see that spirit going abroad, with its  qualities already well defined, its intimacy, its languid sweetness,  its rebellion, its subtle skill in dividing the elements of human  passion, its care for physical beauty, its worship of the body,  which penetrated the early literature of Italy, and finds an echo  even in Dante.    That Abelard is not mentioned in the Divine Comedy may appear  a singular omission to the reader of Dante, who seems to have  inwoven into the texture of his work whatever had impressed him  as either effective in colour or spiritually significant among the  recorded incidents of actual life.  Nowhere in his great poem do  we find the name, nor so much as an allusion to the story of [6]  one who had left so deep a mark on the philosophy of which  Dante was an eager student, of whom in the Latin Quarter, and  from the lips of scholar or teacher in the University of Paris,  during his sojourn among them, he can hardly have failed to hear.  We can only suppose that he had indeed considered the story and  the man, and abstained from passing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#2)"],[1,"moving stars are moving in different directions and seem to  have no connection with each other or with any known star.    It must not be supposed that these enormous velocities seem so to us.  Not one of them, even the greatest, would be visible to the naked eye  until after years of watching. On our finger-ring scale, 1830  Groombridge would be some ten miles and Arcturus thirty or forty miles  away. Either of them would be moving only two or three feet in a year.  To the oldest Assyrian priests Lyra looked much as it does to us  to-day. Among the bright and well-known stars Arcturus has the most  rapid apparent motion, yet Job himself would not to-day see that its  position had changed, unless he had noted it with more exactness than  any astronomer of his time.    Another unsolved problem among the greatest which present themselves to  the astronomer is that of the size of the universe of stars. We know  that several thousand of these bodies are visible to the naked eye;  moderate telescopes show us millions; our giant telescopes of the  present time, when used as cameras to photograph the heavens, show a  number past count, perhaps one hundred millions. Are all these stars  only those few which happen to be near us in a universe extending out  without end, or do they form a collection of stars outside of which is  empty infinite space? In other words, has the universe a boundary?  Taken in its widest scope this question must always remain unanswered  by us mortals because, even if we should discover a boundary within  which all the stars and clusters we ever can know are contained, and  outside of which is empty space, still we could never prove that this  space is empty out to an infinite distance. Far outside of what we call  the universe might still exist other universes which we can never see.    It is a great encouragement to the astronomer that, although he cannot  yet set any exact boundary to this universe of ours, he is gathering  faint indications that it has a boundary, which his successors not many  generations hence may locate so that the astronomer shall include  creation itself within his mental grasp. It can be shown mathematically  that an infinitely extended system of stars would fill the heavens with  a blaze of light like that of the noonday sun. As no such effect is  produced, it may be concluded that the universe has a boundary. But  this does not enable us to locate the boundary, nor to say how many  stars may lie outside the farthest stretches of telescopic vision. Yet  by patient research we are slowly throwing light on these points and  reaching inferences which, not many years ago, would have seemed  forever beyond our powers.    Every one now knows that the Milky Way, that girdle of light which  spans the evening sky, is formed of clouds of stars too minute to be  seen by the unaided vision. It seems to form the base on which the  universe is built and to bind all the stars into a system. It comprises  by far the larger number of stars that the telescope has shown to  exist. Those we see with the naked eye are almost equally scattered  over the sky. But the number which the telescope shows us become more  and more condensed in the Milky Way as telescope power is increased.  The number of new stars brought out with our greatest power is vastly  greater in the Milky Way than in the rest of the sky, so that the  former contains a great majority of the stars. What is yet more  curious, spectroscopic research has shown that a particular kind of  stars, those formed of heated gas, are yet more condensed in the  central circle of this band; if they were visible to the naked eye, we  should see them encircling the heavens as a narrow girdle forming  perhaps the base of our whole system of stars. This arrangement of the  gaseous or vaporous stars is one of the most singular facts that modern  research has brought to light. It seems to show that these particular  stars form a system of their own; but how such a thing can be we are  still unable to see.    The question of the form and extent of the Milky Way thus becomes the  central one of stellar astronomy. Sir William Herschel began by trying  to sound its depths; at one time he thought he had succeeded; but  before he died he saw that they were unfathomable with his most  powerful telescopes. Even today he would be a bold astronomer who would  profess to say with certainty whether the smallest stars we can  photograph are at the boundary of the system. Before we decide this  point we must have some idea of the form and distance of the cloudlike  masses of stars which form our great celestial girdle. A most curious  fact is that our solar system seems to be in the centre of this  galactic universe, because the Milky Way divides the heavens into two  equal parts, and seems equally broad at all points. Were we looking at  such a girdle as this from one side or the other, this appearance would  not be presented. But let us not be too bold. Perhaps we are the  victims of some fallacy, as Ptolemy was when he proved, by what looked  like sound reasoning, based on undeniable facts, that this earth of  ours stood at rest in the centre of the heavens!    A related problem, and one which may be of supreme importance to the  future of our race, is, What is the source of the heat radiated by the  sun and stars? We know that life on the earth is dependent on the heat  which the sun sends it. If we were deprived of this heat we should in a  few days be enveloped in a frost which would destroy nearly all  vegetation, and in a few months neither man nor animal would be alive,  unless crouching over fires soon to expire for want of fuel. We also  know that, at a time which is geologically recent, the whole of New  England was covered with a sheet of ice, hundreds or even thousands of  feet thick, above which no mountain but Washington raised its head. It  is quite possible that a small diminution in the supply of heat sent us  by the sun would gradually reproduce the great glacier, and once more  make the Eastern States like the pole. But the fact is that  observations of temperature in various countries for the last two or  three hundred years do not show any change in climate which can be  attributed to a variation in the amount of heat received from the sun.    The acceptance of this theory of the heat of those heavenly bodies  which shine by their own light--sun, stars, and nebulae--still leaves  open a problem that looks insoluble with our present knowledge. What  becomes of the great flood of heat and light which the sun and stars  radiate into empty space with a velocity of one hundred and eighty  thousand miles a second? Only a very small fraction of it can be  received by the planets or by other stars, because these are mere  points compared with their distance from us. Taking the teaching of our  science just as it stands, we should say that all this heat continues  to move on through infinite space forever. In a few thousand years it  reaches the probable confines of our great universe. But we know of no  reason why it should stop here. During the hundreds of millions of  years since all our stars began to shine, has the first ray of light  and heat kept on through space at the rate of one hundred and eighty  thousand miles a second, and will it continue to go on for ages to  come? If so, think of its distance now, and think of its still going  on, to be forever wasted! Rather say that the problem, What becomes of  it? is as yet unsolved.    Thus far I have described the greatest of problems; those which we may  suppose to concern the inhabitants of millions of worlds revolving  round the stars as much as they concern us. Let us now come down from  the starry heights to this little colony where we live, the solar  system. Here we have the great advantage of being better able to see  what is going on, owing to the comparative nearness of the planets.  When we learn that these bodies are like our earth in form, size, and  motions, the first question we ask is, Could we fly from planet to  planet and light on the surface of each, what sort of scenery would  meet our eyes? Mountain, forest, and field, a dreary waste, or a  seething caldron larger than our earth? If solid land there is, would  we find on it the homes of intelligent beings, the lairs of wild  beasts, or no living thing at all? Could we breathe the air, would we  choke for breath or be poisoned by the fumes of some noxious gas?    To most of these questions science cannot as yet give a positive  answer, except in the case of the moon. Our satellite is so near us  that we can see it has no atmosphere and no water, and therefore cannot  be the abode of life like ours. The contrast of its eternal deadness  with the active life around us is great indeed. Here we have weather of  so many kinds that we never tire of talking about it. But on the moon  there is no weather at all. On our globe so many things are constantly  happening that our thousands of daily journals cannot begin to record  them. But on the dreary, rocky wastes of the moon nothing ever happens.  So far as we can determine, every stone that lies loose on its surface  has lain there through untold ages, unchanged and unmoved.    We cannot speak so confidently of the planets. The most powerful  telescopes yet made, the most powerful we can ever hope to make, would  scarcely shows us mountains, or lakes, rivers, or fields at a distance  of fifty millions of miles. Much less would they show us any works of  man. Pointed at the two nearest planets, Venus and Mars, they whet our  curiosity more than they gratify it. Especially is this the case with  Venus. Ever since the telescope was invented observers have tried to  find the time of rotation of this planet on its axis. Some have reached  one conclusion, some another, while the wisest have only doubted. The  great Herschel claimed that the planet was so enveloped in"]]]
