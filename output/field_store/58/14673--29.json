[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/418"],[0,"A Treatise on Good Works (#2)"],[1,"at Wittenberg, for never before had  Luther expressed himself on the important question of good works in  such a fundamental, thorough and profound way.    2. The Contents of the Work.--A perusal of the contents shows that the  book, in the course of its production, attained a greater length than  was originally intended. To this fact it must be attributed that a new  numeration of sections begins with the argument on the Third  Commandment, and is repeated at every Commandment thereafter, while  before this the sections were consecutively numbered. But in spite of  this, the plan of the whole is clear and lucid. Evidently the whole  treatise is divided into two parts: the first comprising sections 1-17,  while the second comprises all the following sections. The first, being  fundamental, is the more important part. Luther well knew of the  charges made against him that \"faith is so highly elevated\" and \"works  are rejected\" by him; but he knew, too, that \"neither silver, gold and  precious stone, nor any other precious thing had experienced so much  augmentation and diminution\" as had good works \"which should all have  but one simple goodness, or they are nothing but color, glitter and  deception.\" But especially was he aware of the fact that the Church was  urging nothing but the so-called self-elected works, such as \"running  to the convent, singing, reading, playing the organ, saying the mass,  praying matins, vespers, and other hours, founding and ornamenting  churches, altars, convents, gathering chimes, jewels, vestments, gems  and treasures, going to Rome and to the saints, curtsying and bowing  the knees, praying the rosary and the psalter,\" etc., and that she  designated these alone as truly good works, while she represented the  faithful performance of the duties of one's calling as a morality of a  lower order. For these reasons it is Luther's highest object in this  treatise to make it perfectly clear what is the essence of good works.  Whenever the essence of good works has been understood, then the  accusations against him will quickly collapse.    In the fundamental part he therefore argues: \"Truly good works are not  self-elected works of monastic or any other holiness, but such only as  God has commanded, and as are comprehended within the bounds of one's  particular calling, and all works, let their name be what it may,  become good only when they flow from faith, the first, greatest, and  noblest of good works.\" (John 6:29.) In this connection the essence of  faith, that only source of all truly good works, must of course be  rightly understood. It is the sure confidence in God, that all my doing  is wellpleasing to Him; it is trust in His mercy, even though He  appears angry and puts sufferings and adversities upon us; it is the  assurance of the divine good will even though \"God should reprove the  conscience with sin, death and hell, and deny it all grace and mercy,  as though He would condemn and show His wrath eternally.\" Where such  faith lives in the heart, there the works are good \"even though they  were as insignificant as the picking up of a straw\"; but where it is  wanting, there are only such works as \"heathen, Jew and Turk\" may have  and do. Where such faith possesses the man, he needs no teacher in good  works, as little as does the husband or the wife, who only look for  love and favor from one another, nor need any instruction therein \"how  they are to stand toward each other, what they are to do, to leave  undone, to say, to leave unsaid, to think.\"    This faith, Luther continues, is \"the true fulfilment of the First  Commandment, apart from which there is no work that could do justice to  this Commandment.\" With this sentence he combines, on the one hand, the  whole argument on faith, as the best and noblest of good works, with  his opening proposition (there are no good works besides those  commanded of God), and, on the other hand, he prepares the way for the  following argument, wherein he proposes to exhibit the good works  according to the Ten Commandments. For the First Commandment does not  forbid this and that, nor does it require this and that; it forbids but  one thing, unbelief; it requires but one thing, faith, \"that confidence  in God's good will at all times.\" Without this faith the best works are  as nothing, and if man should think that by them he could be  well-pleasing to God, he would be lowering God to the level of a  \"broker or a laborer who will not dispense his grace and kindness  gratis.\"    This understanding of faith and good works, so Luther now addresses his  opponents, should in fairness be kept in view by those who accuse him  of declaiming against good works, and they should learn from it, that  though he has preached against \"good works,\" it was against such as are  falsely so called and as contribute toward the confusion of  consciences, because they are self-elected, do not flow from faith, and  are done with the pretension of doing works well-pleasing to God.    This brings us to the end of the fundamental part of the treatise. It  was not Luther's intention, however, to speak only on the essence of  good works and their fundamental relation to faith; he would show, too,  how the \"best work,\" faith, must prove itself in every way a living  faith, according to the other commandments. Luther does not proceed to  this part, however, until in the fundamental part he has said with  emphasis, that the believer, the spiritual man, needs no such  instruction (I. Timothy 1:9), but that he of his own accord and at all  times does good works \"as his faith, his confidence, teaches him.\" Only  \"because we do not all have such faith, or are unmindful of it,\" does  such instruction become necessary.    Nor does he proceed until he has applied his oft repeated words  concerning the relation of faith to good works to the relation of the  First to the other Commandments. From the fact, that according to the  First Commandment, we acquire a pure heart and confidence toward God,  he derives the good work of the Second Commandment, namely, \"to praise  God, to acknowledge His grace, to render all honor to Him alone.\" From  the same source he derives the good work of the Third Commandment,  namely, \"to observe divine services with prayer and the hearing of  preaching, to incline the imagination of our hearts toward God's  benefits, and, to that end, to mortify and overcome the flesh.\" From  the same source he derives the works of the Second Table.    The argument on the Third and Fourth Commandments claims nearly  one-half of the entire treatise. Among the good works which, according  to the Third Commandment, should be an exercise and proof of faith,  Luther especially mentions the proper hearing of mass and of preaching,  common prayer, bodily discipline and the mortification of the flesh,  and he joins the former and the latter by an important fundamental  discussion of the New Testament conception of Sabbath rest.    Luther discusses the Fourth Commandment as fully as the Third.  The  exercise of faith, according to this Commandment, consists in the  faithful performance of the duties of children toward their parents, of  parents toward their children, and of subordinates toward their  superiors in the ecclesiastical as well as in the common civil sphere.  The various duties issue from the various callings, for faithful  performance of the duties of one's calling, with the help of God and  for God's sake, is the true \"good work.\"    As he now proceeds to speak of the spiritual powers, the government of  the Church, he frankly reveals their faults and demands a reform of the  present rulers. Honor and obedience in all things should be rendered  unto the Church, the spiritual mother, as it is due to natural parents,  unless it be contrary to the first Three Commandments. But as matters  stand now the spiritual magistrates neglect their peculiar work,  namely, the fostering of godliness and discipline, like a mother who  runs away from her children and follows a lover, and instead they  undertake strange and evil works, like parents whose commands are  contrary to God. In this case members of the Church must do as godly  children do whose parents have become mad and insane.  Kings, princes,  the nobility, municipalities and communities must begin of their own  accord and put a check to these conditions, so that the bishops and the  clergy, who are now too timid, may be induced to follow. But even the  civil magistrates must also suffer reforms to be enacted in their  particular spheres; especially are they called on to do away with the  rude \"gluttony and drunkenness,\" luxury in clothing, the usurious sale  of rents and the common brothels. This, by divine and human right, is a  part of their enjoined works according to the Fourth Commandment.    Luther, at last, briefly treats of the Second Table of the  Commandments, but in speaking of the works of these Commandments he  never forgets to point out their relation to faith, thus holding fast  this fundamental thought of the book to the end.  Faith which does not  doubt that God is gracious, he says, will find it an easy matter to be  graciously and favorably minded toward one's neighbor and to overcome  all angry and wrathful desires. In this faith in God the Spirit will  teach us to avoid unchaste thoughts and thus to keep the Sixth  Commandment. When the heart trusts in the divine favor, it cannot seek  after the temporal goods of others, nor cleave to money, but according  to the Seventh Commandment, will use it with cheerful liberality for  the benefit of the neighbor. Where such confidence is present there is  also a courageous, strong and intrepid heart, which will at all times  defend the truth, as the Eighth Commandment demands, whether neck or  coat be at stake, whether it be against pope or kings. Where such faith  is present there is also strife against the evil lust, as forbidden in  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#2)"],[1,"to carry a  paper with it, and Kiki would be unable to resume his proper shape if  he forgot the word or its pronunciation.    So he studied it a long time, repeating it a hundred times in his mind  until he was sure he would not forget it.  But to make safety doubly  sure he placed the paper in a tin box in a neglected part of the garden  and covered the box with small stones.    By this time it was getting late in the day and Kiki wished to attempt  his first transformation before his parents returned from the festival.  So he stood on the front porch of his home and said:    \"I want to become a big, strong bird, like a hawk--Pyrzqxgl!\" He  pronounced it the right way, so in a flash he felt that he was  completely changed in form.  He flapped his wings, hopped to the porch  railing and said: \"Caw-oo!  Caw-oo!\"    Then he laughed and said half aloud: \"I suppose that's the funny sound  this sort of a bird makes.  But now let me try my wings and see if I'm  strong enough to fly across the desert.\"    For he had decided to make his first trip to the country outside the  Land of Oz.  He had stolen this secret of transformation and he knew he  had disobeyed the law of Oz by working magic.  Perhaps Glinda or the  Wizard of Oz would discover him and punish him, so it would be good  policy to keep away from Oz altogether.    Slowly Kiki rose into the air, and resting on his broad wings, floated  in graceful circles above the saucer-shaped mountain-top.  From his  height, he could see, far across the burning sands of the Deadly  Desert, another country that might be pleasant to explore, so he headed  that way, and with strong, steady strokes of his wings, began the long  flight.          2.  The Hawk      Even a hawk has to fly high in order to cross the Deadly Desert, from  which poisonous fumes are constantly rising.  Kiki Aru felt sick and  faint by the time he reached good land again, for he could not quite  escape the effects of the poisons.  But the fresh air soon restored him  and he alighted in a broad table-land which is called Hiland.  Just  beyond it is a valley known as Loland, and these two countries are  ruled by the Gingerbread Man, John Dough, with Chick the Cherub as his  Prime Minister.  The hawk merely stopped here long enough to rest, and  then he flew north and passed over a fine country called Merryland,  which is ruled by a lovely Wax Doll.  Then, following the curve of the  Desert, he turned north and settled on a tree-top in the Kingdom of  Noland.    Kiki was tired by this time, and the sun was now setting, so he decided  to remain here till morning.  From his tree-top he could see a house  near by, which looked very comfortable.  A man was milking a cow in the  yard and a pleasant-faced woman came to the door and called him to  supper.    That made Kiki wonder what sort of food hawks ate.  He felt hungry, but  didn't know what to eat or where to get it.  Also he thought a bed  would be more comfortable than a tree-top for sleeping, so he hopped to  the ground and said: \"I want to become Kiki Aru again--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Instantly he had resumed his natural shape, and going to the house, he  knocked upon the door and asked for some supper.    \"Who are you?\" asked the man of the house.    \"A stranger from the Land of Oz,\" replied Kiki Aru.    \"Then you are welcome,\" said the man.    Kiki was given a good supper and a good bed, and he behaved very well,  although he refused to answer all the questions the good people of  Noland asked him.  Having escaped from his home and found a way to see  the world, the young man was no longer unhappy, and so he was no longer  cross and disagreeable.  The people thought him a very respectable  person and gave him breakfast next morning, after which he started on  his way feeling quite contented.    Having walked for an hour or two through the pretty country that is  ruled by King Bud, Kiki Aru decided he could travel faster and see more  as a bird, so he transformed himself into a white dove and visited the  great city of Nole and saw the King's palace and gardens and many other  places of interest.  Then he flew westward into the Kingdom of Ix, and  after a day in Queen Zixi's country went on westward into the Land of  Ev.  Every place he visited he thought was much more pleasant than the  saucer-country of the Hyups, and he decided that when he reached the  finest country of all he would settle there and enjoy his future life  to the utmost.    In the land of Ev he resumed his own shape again, for the cities and  villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one to  another of them.    Toward evening he came to a good Inn and asked the inn-keeper if he  could have food and lodging.    \"You can if you have the money to pay,\" said the man, \"otherwise you  must go elsewhere.\"    This surprised Kiki, for in the Land of Oz they do not use money at  all, everyone being allowed to take what he wishes without price.  He  had no money, therefore, and so he turned away to seek hospitality  elsewhere.  Looking through an open window into one of the rooms of the  Inn, as he passed along, he saw an old man counting on a table a big  heap of gold pieces, which Kiki thought to be money.  One of these  would buy him supper and a bed, he reflected, so he transformed himself  into a magpie and, flying through the open window, caught up one of the  gold pieces in his beak and flew out again before the old man could  interfere.  Indeed, the old man who was robbed was quite helpless, for  he dared not leave his pile of gold to chase the magpie, and before he  could place the gold in a sack in his pocket the robber bird was out of  sight and to seek it would be folly.    Kiki Aru flew to a group of trees and, dropping the gold piece to the  ground, resumed his proper shape, and then picked up the money and put  it in his pocket.    \"You'll be sorry for this!\" exclaimed a small voice just over his head.    Kiki looked up and saw that a sparrow, perched upon a branch, was  watching him.    \"Sorry for what?\" he demanded.    \"Oh, I saw the whole thing,\" asserted the sparrow.  \"I saw you look in  the window at the gold, and then make yourself into a magpie and rob  the poor man, and then I saw you fly here and make the bird into your  former shape.  That's magic, and magic is wicked and unlawful; and you  stole money, and that's a still greater crime.  You'll be sorry, some  day.\"    \"I don't care,\" replied Kiki Aru, scowling.    \"Aren't you afraid to be wicked?\" asked the sparrow.    \"No, I didn't know I was being wicked,\" said Kiki, \"but if I was, I'm  glad of it.  I hate good people.  I've always wanted to be wicked, but  I didn't know how.\"    \"Haw, haw, haw!\" laughed someone behind him, in a big voice; \"that's  the proper spirit, my lad!  I'm glad I've met you; shake hands.\"    The sparrow gave a frightened squeak and flew away.          3.  Two Bad Ones      Kiki turned around and saw a queer old man standing near.  He didn't  stand straight, for he was crooked.  He had a fat body and thin legs  and arms.  He had a big, round face with bushy, white whiskers that  came to a point below his waist, and white hair that came to a point on  top of his head.  He wore dull-gray clothes that were tight fitting,  and his pockets were all bunched out as if stuffed full of something.    \"I didn't know you were here,\" said Kiki.    \"I didn't come until after you did,\" said the queer old man.    \"Who are you?\" asked Kiki.    \"My name's Ruggedo.  I used to be the Nome King; but I got kicked out  of my country, and now I'm a wanderer.\"    \"What made them kick you out?\" inquired the Hyup boy.    \"Well, it's the fashion to kick kings nowadays.  I was a pretty good  King--to myself--but those dreadful Oz people wouldn't let me alone.  So I had to abdicate.\"    \"What does that mean?\"    \"It means to be kicked out.  But let's talk about something pleasant.  Who are you and where did you come from?\"    \"I'm called Kiki Aru.  I used to live on Mount Munch in the Land of Oz,  but now I'm a wanderer like yourself.\"    The Nome King gave him a shrewd look.    \"I heard that bird say that you transformed yourself into a magpie and  back again.  Is that true?\"    Kiki hesitated, but saw no reason to deny it.  He felt that it would  make him appear more important.    \"Well--yes,\" he said.    \"Then you're a wizard?\"    \"No; I only understand transformations,\" he admitted.    \"Well, that's pretty good magic, anyhow,\" declared old Ruggedo.  \"I  used to have some very fine magic, myself, but my enemies took it all  away from me.  Where are you going now?\"    \"I'm going into the inn, to get some supper and a bed,\" said Kiki.    \"Have you the money to pay for it?\" asked the Nome.    \"I have one gold piece.\"    \"Which you stole.  Very good.  And you're glad that you're wicked.  Better yet.  I like you, young man, and I'll go to the inn with you if  you'll promise not to eat eggs for supper.\"    \"Don't you like eggs?\" asked Kiki.    \"I'm afraid of 'em; they're dangerous!\" said Ruggedo, with a shudder.    \"All right,\" agreed Kiki; \"I won't ask for eggs.\"    \"Then come along,\" said the Nome.    When they entered the inn, the landlord scowled at Kiki and said:    \"I told you I would not feed you unless you had money.\"    Kiki showed him the gold piece.    \"And how about you?\" asked the landlord, turning to Ruggedo.  \"Have you  money?\"    \"I've something better,\" answered the old Nome, and taking a bag from  one of his pockets he poured from it upon the table a mass of  glittering gems--diamonds, rubies and emeralds.    The landlord was very polite to the strangers after that.  He served  them an excellent supper, and while they ate it, the Hyup boy asked his  companion:    \"Where did you get so many jewels?\"    \"Well, I'll tell you,\" answered the Nome.  \"When those Oz people took  my kingdom away from me--just because it was my kingdom and I wanted to  run it to suit myself--they said I could take"]]]
