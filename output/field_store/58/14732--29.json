The Maluka passed the interruption by without comment. \"The Unknown  Woman is brimful of possibilities to a bushman,\" he went on; \"for  although she MAY be all womanly strength and tenderness, she may also  be anything, from a weak timid fool to a self-righteous shrew, bristling  with virtue and indignation. Still,\" he added earnestly, as the  opposition began to murmur, \"when a woman does come into our lives,  whatever type she may be, she lacks nothing in the way of chivalry, and  it rests with herself whether she remains an outsider or becomes just  One of Us. Just One of Us,\" he repeated, unconsciously pleading hard  for the bushman and his greatest need--\"not a goddess on a pedestal, but  just a comrade to share our joys and sorrows with.\"    The opposition wavered. \"If it wasn't for those telegrams,\" it said. But  Darwin, seeing the telegrams in a new light, took up the cudgels for the  bushmen.    \"Poor beggars,\" it said, \"you can't blame them. When you come to think  of it, the Unknown Woman is brimful of possibilities.\" Even then, at  the Katherine, the possibilities of the Unknown Woman were being tersely  summed up by the Wag.    \"You'll sometimes get ten different sorts rolled into one,\" he said  finally, after a long dissertation. \"But, generally speaking, there's  just three sorts of 'em. There's Snorters--the goers, you know--the  sort that go rampaging round, looking for insults, and naturally finding  them; and then there's fools; and they're mostly screeching when they're  not smirking--the uncertain-coy-and-hard-to-please variety, you know,\"  he chuckled, \"and then,\" he added seriously, \"there's the right sort,  the sort you tell things to. They're A1 all through the piece.\"    The Sanguine Scot was confident, though, that they were all alike, and  none of 'em were wanted; but one of the Company suggested \"If she was  little, she'd do. The little 'uns are all right,\" he said.    But public opinion deciding that \"the sort that go messing round where  they know they're not wanted are always big and muscular and snorters,\"  the Sanguine Scot was encouraged in his determination to \"block her  somehow.\"    \"I'll block her yet; see if I don't,\" he said confidently. \"After all  these years on their own, the boys don't want a woman messing round the  place.\" And when he set out for the railway along the north track, to  face the \"escorting trick,\" he repeated his assurances. \"I'll block her,  chaps, never fear,\" he said; and glowering at a \"quiet\" horse that had  been sent by the lady at the Telegraph, added savagely, \"and I'll begin  by losing that brute first turn out.\"        CHAPTER II      From sun-up to sun-down on Tuesday, the train glided quietly forward on  its way towards the Never-Never; and from sun-up to sun-down the Maluka  and I experienced the kindly consideration that it always shows to  travellers: it boiled a billy for us at its furnace; loitered through  the pleasantest valleys; smiled indulgently, and slackened speed  whenever we made merry with blacks, by pelting them with chunks of  water-melon; and generally waited on us hand and foot, the Man-in-Charge  pointing out the beauty spots and places of interest, and making tea for  us at frequent intervals.    It was a delightful train--just a simple-hearted, chivalrous,  weather-beaten old bush-whacker, at the service of the entire Territory.  \"There's nothing the least bit officious or standoffish about it,\" I was  saying, when the Man-in-Charge came in with the first billy of tea.    \"Of course not!\" he said, unhooking cups from various crooked-up  fingers. \"It's a Territorian, you see.\"    \"And had all the false veneer of civilisation peeled off long ago,\"  the Maluka said, adding, with a sly look at my discarded gloves and  gossamer, \"It's wonderful how quietly the Territory does its work.\"    The Man-in-Charge smiled openly as he poured out the tea, proving  thereby his kinship with all other Territorians; and as the train came  to a standstill, swung off and slipped some letters into a box nailed to  an old tree-trunk.    At the far end of the train, away from the engine, the passengers' car  had been placed, and as in front of it a long, long line of low-stacked  sinuous trucks slipped along in the rear of the engine, all was open  view before us; and all day long, as the engine trudged onwards--hands  in pockets, so to speak, and whistling merrily as it trudged--I stood  beside the Maluka on the little platform in front of the passengers'  car, drinking in my first deep, intoxicating draught of the glories of  the tropical bush.    There were no fences to shut us in; and as the train zig-zagged through  jungle and forest and river-valley--stopping now and then to drink  deeply at magnificent rivers ablaze with water-lilies--it almost seemed  as though it were some kindly Mammoth creature, wandering at will  through the bush.    Here and there, kangaroos and other wild creatures of the bush hopped  out of our way, and sitting up, looked curiously after us; again and  again little groups of blacks hailed us, and scrambled after water-melon  and tobacco, with shouts of delight, and, invariably, on nearing the  tiny settlements along the railway, we drove before us white fleeing  flocks of goats.    At every settlement we stopped and passed the time of day and, giving  out mail-bags, moved on again into the forest. Now and again, stockmen  rode out of the timber and received mail-bags, and once a great burly  bushman, a staunch old friend of the Maluka's, boarded the train, and  greeted him with a hearty hand-shake.    \"Hullo! old chap!\" he called in welcome, as he mounted the steps of  the little platform, \"I've come to inspect your latest investment\";  but catching sight of the \"latest investment\" he broke into a deafening  roar.    \"Good Lord!\" he shouted, looking down upon me from his great height, \"is  that all there is of her? They're expecting one of the prize-fighting  variety down there,\" and he jerked his head towards the Never-Never.  Then he congratulated the Maluka on the size of his missus.    \"Gimme the little 'uns,\" he said, nearly wringing my hand off in his  approval. \"You can't beat 'em for pluck. My missus is one of 'em, and  she went bush with me when I'd nothing but a skeeto net and a quart-pot  to share with her.\" Then, slapping the Maluka vigorously on the back, he  told him he'd got some sense left. \"You can't beat the little 'uns,\" he  declared. \"They're just the very thing.\"    The Maluka agreed with him, and after some comical quizzing, they  decided, to their own complete satisfaction, that although the bushman's  \"missus\" was the \"littlest of all little 'uns, straight up and down,\"  the Maluka's \"knocked spots off her sideways.\"    But although the Territory train does not need to bend its neck to the  galling yoke of a minute time-table, yet, like all bush-whackers, it  prefers to strike its supper camp before night-fall, and after allowing  us a good ten minutes' chat, it blew a deferential \"Ahem\" from its  engine, as a hint that it would like to be \"getting along.\" The bushman  took the hint, and after a hearty \"Good luck, missus!\" and a \"chin,  chin, old man,\" left us, with assurances that \"her size 'ud do the  trick.\"    Until sundown we jogged quietly on, meandering through further pleasant  places and meetings; drinking tea and chatting with the Man-in-Charge  between whiles, extracting a maximum of pleasure from a minimum rate  of speed: for travelling in the Territory has not yet passed that  ideal stage where the travelling itself--the actual going--is all  pleasantness.    As we approached Pine Creek I confided to the men-folk that I was  feeling a little nervous. \"Supposing that telegraphing bush-whacker  decides to shoot me off-hand on my arrival,\" I said; and the  Man-in-Charge said amiably: \"It'll be brought in as justifiable  homicide; that's all.\" Then reconnoitring the enemy from the platform,  he \"feared\" we were \"about to be boycotted.\"    There certainly were very few men on the station, and the Man-in-Charge  recognising one of them as the landlord of the Playford, assured us  there was nothing to fear from that quarter. \"You see, you represent  business to him,\" he explained.    Every one but the landlord seemed to have urgent business in the office  or at the far end of the platform, but it was quickly evident that there  was nothing to fear from him; for, finding himself left alone to do the  honours of the Creek, he greeted us with an amused: \"She doesn't look  up to sample sent by telegram\"; and I felt every meeting would be, at  least, unconventional. Then we heard that as Mac had \"only just arrived  from the Katherine, he couldn't leave his horses until they were fixed  up\"; but the landlord's eyes having wandered back to the \"Goer,\" he  winked deliberately at the Maluka before inviting us to \"step across to  the Pub.\"    The Pub seemed utterly deserted, and with another wink the landlord  explained the silence by saying that \"a cyclone of some sort\" had swept  most of his \"regulars\" away; and then he went shouting through the  echoing passages for a \"boy\" to \"fetch along tea.\"    Before the tea appeared, an angry Scotch voice crept to us through thin  partitions, saying: \"It's not a fit place for a woman, and, besides,  nobody wants her!\" And in a little while we heard the same voice  inquiring for \"the Boss.\"    \"The telegraphing bush-whacker,\" I said, and invited the Maluka to come  and see me defy him. But when I found myself face to face with over  six feet of brawny quizzing, wrathful-looking Scotchman, all my courage  slipped away, and edging closer to the Maluka, I held out my hand to the  bushman, murmuring lamely: \"How do you do?\"    Instantly a change came over the rugged, bearded face. At the sight of  the \"Goer\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#2)"],[1,"eeds.    But there are some people, nevertheless--and I am one of them--who  think that the most practical and important thing about a man is still  his view of the universe.  We think that for a landlady considering a  lodger, it is important to know his income, but still more important to  know his philosophy.  We think that for a general about to fight an  enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more  important to know the enemy's philosophy. We think the question is not  whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the  long run, anything else affects them. In the fifteenth century men  cross-examined and tormented a man because he preached some immoral  attitude; in the nineteenth century we feted and flattered Oscar Wilde  because he preached such an attitude, and then broke his heart in penal  servitude because he carried it out. It may be a question which of the  two methods was the more cruel; there can be no kind of question which  was the more ludicrous. The age of the Inquisition has not at least the  disgrace of having produced a society which made an idol of the very  same man for preaching the very same things which it made him a convict  for practising.    Now, in our time, philosophy or religion, our theory, that is, about  ultimate things, has been driven out, more or less simultaneously, from  two fields which it used to occupy.  General ideals used to dominate  literature.  They have been driven out by the cry of \"art for art's  sake.\"  General ideals used to dominate politics. They have been driven  out by the cry of \"efficiency,\" which may roughly be translated as  \"politics for politics' sake.\" Persistently for the last twenty years  the ideals of order or liberty have dwindled in our books; the  ambitions of wit and eloquence have dwindled in our parliaments.  Literature has purposely become less political; politics have purposely  become less literary. General theories of the relation of things have  thus been extruded from both; and we are in a position to ask, \"What  have we gained or lost by this extrusion?  Is literature better, is  politics better, for having discarded the moralist and the philosopher?\"    When everything about a people is for the time growing weak and  ineffective, it begins to talk about efficiency.  So it is that when a  man's body is a wreck he begins, for the first time, to talk about  health. Vigorous organisms talk not about their processes, but about  their aims. There cannot be any better proof of the physical efficiency  of a man than that he talks cheerfully of a journey to the end of the  world. And there cannot be any better proof of the practical efficiency  of a nation than that it talks constantly of a journey to the end of  the world, a journey to the Judgment Day and the New Jerusalem. There  can be no stronger sign of a coarse material health than the tendency  to run after high and wild ideals; it is in the first exuberance of  infancy that we cry for the moon. None of the strong men in the strong  ages would have understood what you meant by working for efficiency.  Hildebrand would have said that he was working not for efficiency, but  for the Catholic Church. Danton would have said that he was working not  for efficiency, but for liberty, equality, and fraternity.  Even if the  ideal of such men were simply the ideal of kicking a man downstairs,  they thought of the end like men, not of the process like paralytics.  They did not say, \"Efficiently elevating my right leg, using, you will  notice, the muscles of the thigh and calf, which are in excellent  order, I--\" Their feeling was quite different. They were so filled with  the beautiful vision of the man lying flat at the foot of the staircase  that in that ecstasy the rest followed in a flash.  In practice, the  habit of generalizing and idealizing did not by any means mean worldly  weakness. The time of big theories was the time of big results.  In the  era of sentiment and fine words, at the end of the eighteenth century,  men were really robust and effective.  The sentimentalists conquered  Napoleon. The cynics could not catch De Wet.  A hundred years ago our  affairs for good or evil were wielded triumphantly by rhetoricians. Now  our affairs are hopelessly muddled by strong, silent men. And just as  this repudiation of big words and big visions has brought forth a race  of small men in politics, so it has brought forth a race of small men  in the arts.  Our modern politicians claim the colossal license of  Caesar and the Superman, claim that they are too practical to be pure  and too patriotic to be moral; but the upshot of it all is that a  mediocrity is Chancellor of the Exchequer. Our new artistic  philosophers call for the same moral license, for a freedom to wreck  heaven and earth with their energy; but the upshot of it all is that a  mediocrity is Poet Laureate. I do not say that there are no stronger  men than these; but will any one say that there are any men stronger  than those men of old who were dominated by their philosophy and  steeped in their religion? Whether bondage be better than freedom may  be discussed. But that their bondage came to more than our freedom it  will be difficult for any one to deny.    The theory of the unmorality of art has established itself firmly in  the strictly artistic classes.  They are free to produce anything they  like.  They are free to write a \"Paradise Lost\" in which Satan shall  conquer God.  They are free to write a \"Divine Comedy\" in which heaven  shall be under the floor of hell. And what have they done?  Have they  produced in their universality anything grander or more beautiful than  the things uttered by the fierce Ghibbeline Catholic, by the rigid  Puritan schoolmaster? We know that they have produced only a few  roundels. Milton does not merely beat them at his piety, he beats them  at their own irreverence.  In all their little books of verse you will  not find a finer defiance of God than Satan's. Nor will you find the  grandeur of paganism felt as that fiery Christian felt it who described  Faranata lifting his head as in disdain of hell. And the reason is very  obvious.  Blasphemy is an artistic effect, because blasphemy depends  upon a philosophical conviction. Blasphemy depends upon belief and is  fading with it. If any one doubts this, let him sit down seriously and  try to think blasphemous thoughts about Thor.  I think his family will  find him at the end of the day in a state of some exhaustion.    Neither in the world of politics nor that of literature, then, has the  rejection of general theories proved a success. It may be that there  have been many moonstruck and misleading ideals that have from time to  time perplexed mankind.  But assuredly there has been no ideal in  practice so moonstruck and misleading as the ideal of practicality.  Nothing has lost so many opportunities as the opportunism of Lord  Rosebery.  He is, indeed, a standing symbol of this epoch--the man who  is theoretically a practical man, and practically more unpractical than  any theorist.  Nothing in this universe is so unwise as that kind of  worship of worldly wisdom. A man who is perpetually thinking of whether  this race or that race is strong, of whether this cause or that cause  is promising, is the man who will never believe in anything long enough  to make it succeed. The opportunist politician is like a man who should  abandon billiards because he was beaten at billiards, and abandon golf  because he was beaten at golf.  There is nothing which is so weak for  working purposes as this enormous importance attached to immediate  victory. There is nothing that fails like success.    And having discovered that opportunism does fail, I have been induced  to look at it more largely, and in consequence to see that it must  fail. I perceive that it is far more practical to begin at the  beginning and discuss theories.  I see that the men who killed each  other about the orthodoxy of the Homoousion were far more sensible than  the people who are quarrelling about the Education Act. For the  Christian dogmatists were trying to establish a reign of holiness, and  trying to get defined, first of all, what was really holy. But our  modern educationists are trying to bring about a religious liberty  without attempting to settle what is religion or what is liberty.  If  the old priests forced a statement on mankind, at least they previously  took some trouble to make it lucid. It has been left for the modern  mobs of Anglicans and Nonconformists to persecute for a doctrine  without even stating it.    For these reasons, and for many more, I for one have come to believe in  going back to fundamentals.  Such is the general idea of this book.  I  wish to deal with my most distinguished contemporaries, not personally  or in a merely literary manner, but in relation to the real body of  doctrine which they teach. I am not concerned with Mr. Rudyard Kipling  as a vivid artist or a vigorous personality; I am concerned with him as  a Heretic--that is to say, a man whose view of things has the hardihood  to differ from mine.  I am not concerned with Mr. Bernard Shaw as one  of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive; I am  concerned with him as a Heretic--that is to say, a man whose philosophy  is quite solid, quite coherent, and quite wrong. I revert to the  doctrinal methods of the thirteenth century, inspired by the general  hope of getting something done.    Suppose that a great commotion arises in the street about something,  let us say a lamp-post, which many influential persons desire to pull  down.  A grey-clad monk, who is the spirit of the Middle Ages, is  approached upon the matter, and begins to say, in the arid manner of  the Schoolmen, \"Let us first of all consider, my brethren, the value of  Light.  If Light be in itself good--\" At this point he is somewhat  excusably knocked down. "]]]
