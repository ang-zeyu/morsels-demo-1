The final sentence,  it is probable, which pronounces characters and actions amiable or  odious, praise-worthy or blameable; that which stamps on them the mark  of honour or infamy, approbation or censure; that which renders morality  an active principle and constitutes virtue our happiness, and vice our  misery; it is probable, I say, that this final sentence depends on some  internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole  species. For what else can have an influence of this nature? But  in order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and give a proper  discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that  much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just  conclusions drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations  examined, and general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of  beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first appearance, command  our affection and approbation; and where they fail of this effect, it is  impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence, or adapt  them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many orders of beauty,  particularly those of the finer arts, it is requisite to employ much  reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment; and a false relish  may frequently be corrected by argument and reflection. There are just  grounds to conclude, that moral beauty partakes much of this latter  species, and demands the assistance of our intellectual faculties, in  order to give it a suitable influence on the human mind.    But though this question, concerning the general principles of morals,  be curious and important, it is needless for us, at present, to employ  farther care in our researches concerning it. For if we can be so happy,  in the course of this enquiry, as to discover the true origin of morals,  it will then easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters  into all determinations of this nature [Footnote: See Appendix I]. In  order to attain this purpose, we shall endeavour to follow a very simple  method: we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities, which  form what, in common life, we call Personal Merit: we shall consider  every attribute of the mind, which renders a man an object either  of esteem and affection, or of hatred and contempt; every habit or  sentiment or faculty, which, if ascribed to any person, implies either  praise or blame, and may enter into any panegyric or satire of his  character and manners. The quick sensibility, which, on this head, is so  universal among mankind, gives a philosopher sufficient assurance, that  he can never be considerably mistaken in framing the catalogue, or incur  any danger of misplacing the objects of his contemplation: he needs only  enter into his own breast for a moment, and consider whether or not he  should desire to have this or that quality ascribed to him, and whether  such or such an imputation would proceed from a friend or an enemy.  The very nature of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a  judgement of this nature; and as every tongue possesses one set of words  which are taken in a good sense, and another in the opposite, the least  acquaintance with the idiom suffices, without any reasoning, to direct  us in collecting and arranging the estimable or blameable qualities of  men. The only object of reasoning is to discover the circumstances  on both sides, which are common to these qualities; to observe that  particular in which the estimable qualities agree on the one hand,  and the blameable on the other; and thence to reach the foundation of  ethics, and find those universal principles, from which all censure or  approbation is ultimately derived. As this is a question of fact, not  of abstract science, we can only expect success, by following the  experimental method, and deducing general maxims from a comparison  of particular instances. The other scientific method, where a general  abstract principle is first established, and is afterwards branched out  into a variety of inferences and conclusions, may be more perfect in  itself, but suits less the imperfection of human nature, and is a common  source of illusion and mistake in this as well as in other subjects.  Men are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural  philosophy, and will hearken to no arguments but those which are derived  from experience. It is full time they should attempt a like reformation  in all moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics, however  subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation.    We shall begin our enquiry on this head by the consideration of the  social virtues, Benevolence and Justice. The explication of them will  probably give us an opening by which the others may be accounted for.          SECTION II. OF BENEVOLENCE.        PART I.        It may be esteemed, perhaps, a superfluous task to prove, that the  benevolent or softer affections are estimable; and wherever they appear,  engage the approbation and good-will of mankind. The epithets  SOCIABLE, GOOD-NATURED, HUMANE, MERCIFUL, GRATEFUL, FRIENDLY, GENEROUS,  BENEFICENT, or their equivalents, are known in all languages, and  universally express the highest merit, which HUMAN NATURE is capable  of attaining. Where these amiable qualities are attended with birth  and power and eminent abilities, and display themselves in the good  government or useful instruction of mankind, they seem even to raise  the possessors of them above the rank of HUMAN NATURE, and make them  approach in some measure to the divine. Exalted capacity, undaunted  courage, prosperous success; these may only expose a hero or politician  to the envy and ill-will of the public: but as soon as the praises are  added of humane and beneficent; when instances are displayed of lenity,  tenderness or friendship; envy itself is silent, or joins the general  voice of approbation and applause.    When Pericles, the great Athenian statesman and general, was on his  death-bed, his surrounding friends, deeming him now insensible, began to  indulge their sorrow for their expiring patron, by enumerating his great  qualities and successes, his conquests and victories, the unusual length  of his administration, and his nine trophies erected over the enemies of  the republic. YOU FORGET, cries the dying hero, who had heard all, YOU  FORGET THE MOST EMINENT OF MY PRAISES, WHILE YOU DWELL SO MUCH ON THOSE  VULGAR ADVANTAGES, IN WHICH FORTUNE HAD A PRINCIPAL SHARE. YOU HAVE  NOT OBSERVED THAT NO CITIZEN HAS EVER YET WORNE MOURNING ON MY ACCOUNT.  [Plut. in Pericle]    In men of more ordinary talents and capacity, the social virtues become,  if possible, still more essentially requisite; there being nothing  eminent, in that case, to compensate for the want of them, or preserve  the person from our severest hatred, as well as contempt. A high  ambition, an elevated courage, is apt, says Cicero, in less perfect  characters, to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity. The more social and  softer virtues are there chiefly to be regarded. These are always good  and amiable [Cic. de Officiis, lib. I].    The principal advantage, which Juvenal discovers in the extensive  capacity of the human species, is that it renders our benevolence also  more extensive, and gives us larger opportunities of spreading our  kindly influence than what are indulged to the inferior creation [Sat.  XV. 139 and seq.]. It must, indeed, be confessed, that by doing good  only, can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent. His exalted  station, of itself but the more exposes him to danger and tempest.  His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors, who repose  themselves under his cover and protection.    But I forget, that it is not my present business to recommend generosity  and benevolence, or to paint, in their true colours, all the genuine  charms of the social virtues. These, indeed, sufficiently engage every  heart, on the first apprehension of them; and it is difficult to abstain  from some sally of panegyric, as often as they occur in discourse or  reasoning. But our object here being more the speculative, than the  practical part of morals, it will suffice to remark, (what will readily,  I believe, be allowed) that no qualities are more intitled to the  general good-will and approbation of mankind than beneficence and  humanity, friendship and gratitude, natural affection and public spirit,  or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy with others, and a generous  concern for our kind and species. These wherever they appear seem to  transfuse themselves, in a manner, into each beholder, and to call  forth, in their own behalf, the same favourable and affectionate  sentiments, which they exert on all around.        PART II.        We may observe that, in displaying the praises of any humane, beneficent  man, there is one circumstance which never fails to be amply insisted  on, namely, the happiness and satisfaction, derived to society from  his intercourse and good offices. To his parents, we are apt to say, he  endears himself by his pious attachment and duteous care still more than  by the connexions of nature. His children never feel his authority,  but when employed for their advantage. With him, the ties of love are  consolidated by beneficence and friendship. The ties of friendship  approach, in a fond observance of each obliging office, to those of  love and inclination. His domestics and dependants have in him a sure  resource; and no longer dread the power of fortune, but so far as she  exercises it over him. From him the hungry receive food, the naked  clothing, the ignorant and slothful skill and industry. Like the sun, an  inferior minister of providence he cheers, invigorates, and sustains the  surrounding world.    If confined to private life,"]]]
