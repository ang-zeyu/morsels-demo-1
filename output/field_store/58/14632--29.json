THE SHEEP.          CHAPTER I.    HISTORY OF THE SHEEP.      (1.) _Origin of the Sheep._--As the origin of our domesticated animals  has afforded scope for much curious speculation, so none have  attracted a greater degree of attention in this respect than the  sheep. Into these arguments, however, it would be absurd to enter; I  shall therefore content myself with such opinions as are deemed the  best.    Placed in the Class Mammalia, and Order Ruminantia, the innumerable  varieties at present existing may, according to Cuvier, whose tact in  arranging animals is universally acknowledged, all be referred to four  species--the Argali of Siberia, the Mouflon of Sardinia, the Mouflon  of America, and the Mouflon of Africa--though to be rigidly accurate  in natural distinctions he would refer them all to three, thereby  excluding the third.    (2.) _The Argali of Siberia_ (_Ovis Ammon_) inhabits the mountains of  Asia, where it attains the size of a fallow deer. The male has very  large horns, with three rounded angles at the base, flattened in  front, and striated transversely. The horns of the female are  compressed, and hook-shaped. The hair is short in summer, and of a  fawn-coloured grey; in winter it is thick, rigid, and of a reddish  grey, with some white about the muzzle, throat, and under the belly.  The Mouflon of Sardinia (_Ovis Musimon_, Fig. 1. Pl. I.) differs from  it only in its inferior size, and in the smallness of the horns of the  female.    (3.) _The Mouflon of America_ (_Ovis Montana_) closely resembles the  Argali, and is supposed by some to be identical with it, and to have  crossed from Asia to America at Behring's Straits by means of ice.    (4.) _The Mouflon of Africa_ (_Ovis Tragelaphus_) is distinguished by  its soft and reddish hair, by its short tail, and by a long mane  hanging under the neck, and another at each ancle; it inhabits the  rocky districts of Barbary, and has been observed in Egypt.    (5.) _British Breeds._--The breeds of our island, as they at present  stand, may be divided into two kinds--long-woolled and short-woolled;  the former embracing the Lincolnshire, the Teeswater, the Dishley, or  New Leicester, and the Devonshire Nots; while the latter will include  those of Dorset, Herefordshire, and Sussex, with the Cheviot, Mugg,  and Black-faced variety.[1]            [1] Encyclopedia Britannica, 7th Edition, Article Agriculture.    (6). _The Lincolnshire_ has no horns; the face is white; the carcass  long and thin; the legs thick, white, and rough; bones large; pelts  thick; and the wool from 8 to 10 inches in length. The ewes weigh from  14 lbs. to 20 lbs. per quarter; and three-year old wethers 20 lbs. to  30 lbs. The fleece weighs from 8 lbs. to 14 lbs., and covers a  coarse-grained slow-feeding carcass; so slow, indeed, at feeding, that  it cannot be fattened at an early age, except upon rich land; but the  breed is encouraged, from the great weight of wool that is shorn from  them every year. It and its sub-varieties are extremely common in the  English counties.    (7.) _The Teeswater_ sheep were originally bred from the same stock as  the former, but have become different, from the size having received  greater attention than the wool, which is inferior both in length and  weight. They stand upon higher and finer boned legs, which support a  firmer and heavier carcass, much wider upon the back and sides, and  afford a fatter and finer-grained mutton--the two-year-old wethers  weighing from 25 lbs. to 30 lbs. per quarter. Marshall, in his work on  Yorkshire, remarks, that they are not so compact, nor so complete in  their form, as the Leicestershire sheep; nevertheless, the excellency  of their flesh and fatting quality is not doubted, and their wool  still remains superior. For the banks of the Tees, or any other rich  fat land, they are singularly excellent.    (8.) _The Dishley_, or _New Leicester_, is distinguished from other  long-woolled breeds, by clean heads, straight broad flat backs, round  bodies, small bones, thin pelts, and a disposition to fatten at an  early age. But more of this hereafter. The weight of three-year-old  ewes is from 18 lbs. to 26 lbs. per quarter; and of two-year old  wethers from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs. The wool averages from 6 lbs. to 8  lbs., and is thought by some to be inferior in quality to that of  Cheviot sheep; but, from being fully fed at all seasons, they yield  great quantities of it. Fig. 1. Pl. III.    (9.) _The Devonshire Nots_ form the fourth hornless variety of  long-woolled sheep. Forty or fifty years ago, they ranked as  middle-woolled sheep; but they now figure among the long-wools, under  the name of Bamptons--their fleece having been lengthened, and  rendered finer, by crossing with the Leicesters. There is yet,  however, much room for improvement in these crosses. They have white  faces and legs, the latter being short, and the bones large, while the  necks are thick, the backs high, and the sides good. They approach in  weight to the Leicester, but the wool is heavier and coarser. In  Devonshire are found a white-faced and horned variety, which are known  as the Exmoor kind, from the place of their nativity. Though delicate  in bone, they are not good, having a narrow flat-sided carcass; while  the weight of the quarters and fleece is a third short of the former  variety.    (10.) _The Dorsetshire sheep_ are horned and white-faced, with a long  thin carcass, and high small white legs. Three-year-old wethers weigh  from 16 lbs. to 20 lbs. a quarter; but the wool, being fine and short,  weighs only from 3 lbs. to 4 lbs. a fleece. It is, however, amply  compensated for by the mutton, which is of superior quality. The  peculiar and most valuable property of this breed is the forwardness  of the ewes, which take the ram at any period of the year, often  lambing, so early as September or October. They are, on this account,  extremely useful for supplying large towns with house-lamb at  Christmas. Fig. 1, Pl. II.    (11.) _Herefordshire_ or _Ryeland sheep_ have white legs and faces,  and no horns. The wool grows close to the eyes. They are a small  breed, suited to every market, weighing from 12 lbs. to 16 lbs.  a-quarter. The carcass is tolerably well-formed, and the wool fine and  short, each fleece weighing from 1-1/2 lb. to 2-1/2 lbs., rarely,  however, exceeding 2 lbs. They were called _Ryeland_ sheep, from a  district in the southern part of Herefordshire being thought capable  of growing nothing but rye. Though their figure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#2)"],[1,"eight-class rule  exists, and it is, confessedly, the most advanced of all.    In this respect, then, the Arunta of the centre of Australia are  certainly more advanced than the Euahlayi. The Arunta have eight, not  four, intermarrying classes. In the matter of rites and ceremonies,  too, they are, in the opinion of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, more  advanced than, say, the Euahlayi. They practise universal 'subincision'  of the males, and circumcision, in place of the more primitive knocking  out of the front teeth. Their ceremonies are very prolonged: in Messrs.  Spencer and Gillen's experience, rites lasted for four months during a  great tribal gathering. That the Arunta could provide supplies for so  prolonged and large an assembly, argues high organisation, or a region  well found in natural edible objects. Yet the region is arid and barren,  so the organisation is very high. For all these reasons, even if we do not  regard paternal descent of the totem as a step in progress from maternal  descent, the Arunta seem greatly advanced in social conditions.    Yet they are said to lack entirely that belief in a moral and kindly  'All Father,' such as Byamee, which Mrs. Parker describes as potent  among the less advanced Euahlayi, and which Mr. Howitt has found among  non-coastal tribes of the south-east, with female descent of the totem,  but without matrimonial classes--that is, among the most primitive tribes  of all.    Here occurs a remarkable difficulty. Mr. Howitt asserts, with Mr.  Frazer's concurrence, that (in Mr. Frazer's words) 'the same regions in  which the germs of religion begin to appear have also made some  progress towards a higher form of social and family life.'['The Beginnings  of Religion and Totemism among the Australian Aborigines,' Fortnightly  Review, September 1905, p. 452.] But the social advance from maternal to  paternal descent of the totem, we have seen, is not necessarily an advance  at all, in Mr. Frazer's opinion. [IBID. p. 462.] The Arunta, for example,  he thinks, never recognised female descent of the totem. They have never  recognised, indeed, he thinks, any hereditary descent of the totem,  though in all other respects, as in hereditary magistracies, and  inheritance of the right to practise the father's totemic ritual, they  do reckon in the male line. By such advantage, however it was acquired,  they are more progressive than, say, the Euahlayi. But, progressive as  they are, they have not, like the more pristine tribes of the south-east,  developed 'the germs of religion,' the belief in a benevolent or ruling  'All Father.' Unlike the tribes of the south-east, they have co-operative  totemic magic. Each totem community does magic for its totem, as part of  the food supply of the united tribe. But the tribe, though so SOLIDAIRE,  and with its eight classes and hereditary magistracies so advanced, has  developed no germs of religion at all. Arunta progress has thus been  singularly unequal.    The germs of religion are spoken of as the results of social advance,  but, while so prominent in social advance, the Arunta have no trace of  religion. The tribes northward from them to the sea are also very  advanced socially, but (with one known exception not alluded to by Mr.  Frazer) have no 'All Father,' no germ of religion.    From this fact, if correctly reported, it is obvious that social  progress is not the cause, nor the necessary concomitant, of advance in  religious ideas.    Again, the influence of the sea, in causing a 'heavier rainfall, a more  abundant vegetation, and a more plentiful supply of food,' with an  easier and more reflective life than that of 'the arid wilderness of  the interior,' cannot be, as is alleged, the cause of the germs of  religion. [IBID. p. 463.] If this were the case, the coastal tribes of the  Gulf of Carpentaria and of the north generally would have developed the  All Father belief. Yet, in spite of their coastal environment, and richer  existence, and social advance, the northern coastal tribes are not  credited with the belief in the All Father. Meanwhile tribes with no  matrimonial classes, and with female descent of the totem--tribes  dwelling from five to seven hundred miles away from the southern sea--do  possess the All Father belief as far north as Central Queensland, no  less than did the almost or quite extinct tribes of the south coast,  who had made what is (or is not) 'the great step in progress' of  paternal descent of the totem.    Again, arid and barren as is the central region tenanted by the Arunta,  it seems to permit or encourage philosophic reflection, for their  theory of evolution is remarkably coherent and ingenious. The theory of  evolution implies as much reflection as that of creation! Their magic  for the behoof of edible objects is attributed to the suddenness of  their first rains,[IBID. p. 465.] and the consequent outburst of life,  which the natives attribute to their own magical success. But  rainmaking magic, as Mrs. Langloh Parker shows, is practised with  sometimes amazing success among the Euahlayi, who work no magic at all  for their totems. Their magic, if it brings rain, benefits their totems  at large, but for each totem in particular, no Euahlayi totem kin does  magic.    Again, agricultural magic has been, and indeed is, practised in Europe,  in conditions of climate unlike those of the Arunta; and totemic magic  is freely practised in North America, in climatic conditions dissimilar  from those of Central Australia.    For all these reasons I must confess that I do not follow the logic of  the philosophy which makes social advance the cause of the belief in  the All Father, and coastal rains the cause of social advance. The  Arunta have the social advance, the eight classes, the relatively high  organisation; but they have neither the climatic conditions supposed to  produce the advance, nor the religion which the advance is supposed to  produce. The northern coastal tribes, again, have the desired climatic  conditions, and the social advance, but they have not the germs of  religion found in many far inland southern tribes, like the Euahlayi,  whose social progress is extremely moderate. We thus find, from the  northern coast to the centre, one supposed result of coastal  conditions, namely, social progress, but not the other supposed result  of coastal conditions, namely, the All Father belief. I do not say that  it does not exist, for it is a secret belief, but it is not reported by  Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. On the other hand, among tribes of the  south-east very far from the coast, we find the lowest grades of social  progress, but we also find the All Father belief. I am ready, of  course, to believe that good conditions of life beget progress, social  and religious, as a general rule. But other causes exist; speculation  anywhere may take crudely scientific rather than crudely religious  lines. Especially the belief in ancestral spirits may check or nullify  the belief in a remote All Father. We see this among the Zulus, where  spirits entirely dominate religion, and the All Father is, at most, the  shadow of a name, Unkulunkulu. We may detect the same influence among  the northern tribes of Australia, where ancestral spirits dominate  thought and society, though they receive no sacrifice or prayer.  Meanwhile, if we accept Mrs. Parker's evidence, among the Euahlayi  ancestral spirits are of no account in religion, while the All Father  is obeyed, and, on some occasions, is addressed in prayer; and may even  cause rain, if property approached by a human spirit which has just  entered his mansions. Clearly, climatic causes and natural environment  are not the only factors in producing and directing the speculative  ideas of men in early society.    We must also remember that the neighbours of the Arunta, northwards,  who share certain peculiar Arunta ideas, possess, beyond all doubt,  either the earliest germs of belief in the All Father, or that belief  in a decadent condition of survival. This is quite certain; for,  whereas the Arunta laugh at all inquiries as to what went before the  'Alcheringa,' or mythic age of evolution, the Kaitish, according to  Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, aver that an anthropomorphic being, who  dwells above the sky, and is named Atnatu, first created himself, and  then 'made the Alcheringa,'--the mythic age of primal evolution. Of  mankind, some, in Kaitish opinion, were evolved; of others Atnatu is  the father. He expelled men to earth from his heaven for neglect of his  ceremonies, but he provided them with weapons and all that they  possess. He is not TROS FERRO SUR LA MORALE: he has made no MORAL laws,  but his ritual laws, as to circumcision and the whirling of the  bull-roarer, must be observed as strictly as the ritual laws of Byamee  of the Euahlayi. In this sense of obedience due to a heavenly father  who begat men, or some of them, punished them, and started them on  their terrene career, laying down ceremonial rules, we have certainly  'the germs of religion' in a central tribe cognate to the Arunta.    Mr. Frazer detects only two traces of religion in the centre, omitting  the Kaitish Atnatu, ['The Beginnings of Religion and Totemism among the  Australian Aborigines,' FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW, September 1905, p. 452,  Note 1.] but I am unable to see how the religious aspect of Atnatu,  non-moral as it is, can be overlooked. He is the father of part of the  tribe, and all are bound to, observe his ceremonial rules. He accounts for  the beginning of the beginning; he is the cause of the Alcheringa; men owe  duties to him. We do not know whether he was once as potent in their  hearts, and as moral as Byamee, but has DOGRINGOLO under Arunta  philosophic influences; or whether Byamee is a more highly evolved form of  Atnatu. But it is quite certain that the Kaitish, in a region as far  almost from the north sea as that of the Arunta, and further from"]]]
