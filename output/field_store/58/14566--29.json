On June 12 near Yongdae-ri many  individuals were seen (several pairs in amplexus), along Route 24  paralleling the Puk-ch'on, in rain pools and in ditches and backwashes  from the river; almost all available water contained small  (approximately 10 x 10 mm.) egg masses. Numbers of eggs per mass,  selected at random, were 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8, 8, 2 and 5. Some that were  saved subsequently hatched on June 15-17.    The call is a quiet low trill or series of staccato whistles rising  slightly at the beginning; a short peeplike note also was heard. The  specimens from Cheju Do, which are generally smaller than those  collected on the mainland in spring, were taken on September 6 in a  small stream that had large volcanic rocks in many places and that was  flanked by thick brush and small trees. The earliest and latest dates on  which _B. orientalis_ was collected were April 21 and September 6,  respectively.    In the breeding season, males are distinguished from females by the  large blackish (probably brownish earlier in season) areas on the  anteroventral surface of the antebrachium, the metacarpal tubercle, and  the inner surface of the first finger (sometimes also the second and  third). Also, males have conspicuous black-tipped tubercles on the back  (usually absent in females) that extend onto the limbs (usually smooth  in females, at least laterally). Field observations by one of us (Byers)  suggested that the dorsal pattern of males had greater contrast than  that of females and that the venter was brighter reddish. Eight females  from Tangjonggok averaged 47.9 (43-51) in snout-vent length, whereas 24  males from there averaged 50.0 (46-55), indicating little, if any, size  difference between the sexes.    Okada (1931:29) recorded variation in color of live Korean individuals  (green or brown dorsally and pale yellow or red ventrally) and variation  in extent of black markings on the belly (_op. cit._:fig. 12). The  specimens from Cheju Do (28, 32, 32, 32, 37 and 46 in snout-vent length)  have less black ventrally than specimens from the mainland.      =Bufo bufo gargarizans= Cantor        _Bufo gargarizans_ Cantor, Ann.

Mus., 58:59,        July 22, 1907.        _Specimens examined_ (10).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 1 (KU); 5 mi. NW Choksong, near Imjin River, 1 (KU); 5      mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 4 (KU), 2 (UMMZ); 1 mi. S      Yami-ri, 1 (KU).        _Description (nine females)._--Dorsal surface brownish, having      indistinct pale areas, some of which tend to form longitudinal      stripes that extend posteriorly from parotoid glands; blackish      mark, usually on lateral part of parotoid, having short spurs      directed posteriorly and ventrally; edge of upper jaw and warts on      dorsal surface becoming blackish with increasing size; small,      conspicuous group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoid;      middorsal warts tending, at level of posterior edge of parotoids, to      form a V that has its apex between the parotoids; ventral surface      pale yellowish, sometimes having well-defined blackish marks;      granular underparts of large specimens having small blackish      tubercles.        _Male (KU 40118 from 5 mi. E Seoul)._--Snout-vent length, 65; no      vocal sacs or slits; dorsal and inner surfaces of first and second      fingers, and inner surface of third finger black; canthus rostralis      indistinct (a well-defined ridge on right side); nostrils closer to      tip of snout than to eye, their distance from each other slightly      less than interorbital width; interorbital width (6.2) greater than      width of eyelid (4.7); tympanum distinct, circular, its diameter      (3.0) less than length of eye (6.5), and approximately twice      distance (1.6) of tympanum from eye; no cranial crests; parotoid      gland elongate, approximately twice as long as broad (12.5 x 5.0),      narrowly separated from posterior edge of eyelid; head elongate      (width at posterior edge of tympanum, 23.6); length from posterior      edge of tympanum to tip of upper jaw, 18.9; first finger slightly      longer than second, fourth finger about two-thirds as long as third;      most subarticular tubercles divided; outer palmar tubercle larger      than inner; heels not touching when folded legs placed at right      angles to longitudinal axis of body; tibiotarsal articulation just      reaching eye when leg laid forward; tarsometatarsal articulation not      reaching beyond snout; foot large (tibiotarsal articulation to tip      of fourth toe approximately 46.0); fourth toe approximately half      webbed, other toes more than half webbed; edges of webs somewhat      crenulate; some subarticular tubercles divided; length of inner      metatarsal tubercle (4.5) more than half length of first toe (7.0);      inner metatarsal tubercle larger than outer, both darkened; tarsal      fold extending from inner metatarsal tubercle for approximately      two-thirds length of tarsus; tips of toes (not fingers) darkened;      dorsal surface of back and proximal part of hind legs coarsely      granular, of rounded, pavement-type tubercles lacking sharp tips;      small group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoids; dorsal      pattern contrasting and irregular (especially on limbs), of dark      brown and pale gray; conspicuous black mark (interrupted) on lateral      surface of parotoid having two, well-defined spurs that project      posteroventrally; undersurface granular, lacking markings except for      two indistinctly-margined dark spots on chest, and black spot on      left leg.    _Remarks._--This nocturnal, introduced species (Okada, 1931:47) is  presumably widespread in Korea and seemingly prefers lowland habitats.  Individuals were taken in sparse vegetation on a sand flat near the Han  River, at the edge of a rice field in a light rain, along a road at  night, and in millet fields adjacent to the Han River, which was  flooding at that time (July 9).    As is obvious from the foregoing descriptions, the male (KU 40118),  which was obtained on March 19, differs considerably from the nine  females; neither does it agree with Stejneger's (1907:66) or Okada's  (_op. cit._:45-46, fig. 18) description of males of _Bufo bufo asiaticus  [=gargarizans]_ from Wonsan and Seoul. Upon cursory examination, KU  40118 is notable for having a contrasting dorsal pattern and elongate,  ranidlike proportions. Some of the characteristics resemble those of  _Bufo raddei_ Strauch as given by Stejneger (_op. cit._:70-72, figs.  53-57), Okada (1935:9, figs. 2 and 32-34, pls. II-III), and Liu  (1950:203-205, fig. 43).    Stejneger (_op. cit._:59-68) recognized _B. b. gargarizans_ as occurring  in southern China, and _Bufo bufo asiaticus_ as the subspecies occurring  in northern China. Subsequently, _asiaticus_ was relegated to synonymy  under the earlier-named _gargarizans_--see discussions by Pope and  Boring (1940:33) and Liu (_op. cit._:220).      =Kaloula borealis= (Barbour)        _Cacopoides borealis_ Barbour, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 51(12):231,        April, 1908 (type locality, Antung, Manchuria).        _Kaloula borealis_, Noble, Amer. Mus. Novit., 165:6, April 16, 1925.        _Specimens examined_ (8).--5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3      (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU).    _Remarks._--On April 5, one male and three females were uncovered by a  bulldozer from between one and two feet below the surface of the ground  in an old Korean burial mound; one individual was completely surrounded  by compact soil. All quickly became active when placed in water. Two of  the females (43 and 44 in snout-vent length) contained masses of  immature eggs. A male obtained on June 4 was found during a rain; the  three UMMZ specimens were obtained on July 8 on banks above the Han  River. Breeding of this species seems to coincide with the rainy season  in late spring and early summer when males were noted calling around  flooded ditches and swales in deep grass. The local Korean name of the  species, which sounds something like \"maeng-kongi,\" is said to come from  the call, which is best described as a monotonous, snoring sound that  rarely is heard in two parts as suggested by the name.      =Hyla arborea japonica= G[:u]nther        [_Hyla arborea_] Var. _japonica_ G[:u]nther, Catalogue of the Batrachia        Salientia in the ...

Two individuals were  taken in the morning of May 29 on leaf litter in a wooded valley in the  Central National Forest where a number were calling in a light rain, but  the species was rarely found in woods. Two frogs were found along a  rocky stream at Sangbonch'on-ni. Most individuals were taken while  calling, on grasses and reeds or on the ground, along the edges of rice  fields.

(KU No. 40143). x 4.]    _Relationships._--Using Dunn's (1928) arrangement of the American  colubrid snakes as a guide permits the taxonomist to group _Tantalophis_  with several genera, some of which occur in South America and others in  the West Indies. Although the significance of such generic characters as  scale pits and nature of the hemipenis is not clear, these characters  must, of necessity, be utilized in attempting to ascertain the  relationships of _Tantalophis_ to other colubrid snakes. Assuming that  the primary divisions of the American colubrids into subfamilies based  on the nature of the sulcus spermaticus and the presence or absence of  hypapophyses on the posterior vertebrae have some reality, _Tantalophis_  must be placed in the subfamily Xenodontinae comprising genera chiefly  South American in their distribution, but with several genera in Middle  America and a few in North America and the West Indies. In order to  limit the number of genera to be compared with _Tantalophis_, only those  xenodontines having apical pits and bifurcate hemipenis are considered.  These include _Cyclagras_, _Drepanoides_, _Hypsirhynchus_, _Ialtris_,  _Leimadophis_, _Pseudablabes_, _Siphlophis_, _Tachymenis_, _Tomodon_,  and _Trypanurgos_. Aside from differences in scutellation,  _Leimadophis_, _Siphlophis_, and _Trypanurgos_ have the heads of the  hemipenes terminating in a disc, and _Ialtris_ has a plicate hemipenis.  _Tomodon_ has basal spines on the hemipenis. The hemipenes of the other  genera have proximal folds, distal spines, and distal calyces, not  greatly unlike the condition found in _Tantalophis_. Of these,  _Cyclagras_, _Hypsirhynchus_, and _Pseudablabes_ have round pupils and  certain differences in scutellation. _Drepanoides_ and _Tachymenis_ have  elliptical pupils like those of _Tantalophis_, but _Tachymenis_ has only  one apical pit, and _Drepanoides_ has one apical pit or none. In the  above characters no especially close relationship between _Tantalophis_  and any one of these genera is apparent.    If the characteristics usually employed in distinguishing and relating  genera are ignored and other more subjective criteria are used, the  relationships of _Tantalophis_ still remain obscure. Of the xenodontine  genera _Tantalophis_ approaches _Leimadophis_ in general physiognomy;  perhaps it represents an early divergent stock of _Leimadophis_ that has  undergone radical changes in the hemipenis and other characters. On the  other hand, if the nature of the hemipenis is of no importance in  defining supergeneric groups of colubrid snakes, _Tantalophis_ may have  its relationships with _Leptodeira_ and _Hypsiglena_. Although  herpetologists have been working intensively on American colubrids for  many decades, the relationships of the majority of the groups are not  well understood. Until the hemipenes and skulls of all of the forms have  been studied and compared, and the evolutionary significance has been  determined for the characters of the hemipenes, dentition, and apical  pits, our knowledge of the relationships of these snakes will be  incomplete.    _Remarks._--The individual on which this paper is based is the only  specimen of the species with definite locality data. It is from a  locality six miles southeast of Tamazulapam in northwestern Oaxaca. This  town lies at an elevation of about 6500 feet in the upper reaches of the  Balsas Basin, an arid interior valley that expands in its upper end to  form a broad basin of rolling and dissected terrain ranging from about  4000 to 6800 feet in elevation. The countryside around Tamazulapam is  arid and supports plants of the genera _Prosopis_, _Acacia_, _Ipomoea_,  and _Cassia_, and also columnar cacti. Oaks and pines grow on the  limestone hills rising above the rolling valley. _Tantalophis_ may be  endemic to the Balsas Basin, as are many other species of reptiles.  However, if the snake has its relatives to the south in lower Central  America and South America, such a distribution seems unlikely, even for  an apparent relict.    _Acknowledgments._--For permission to study and report on this specimen  I am indebted to Dr. E. Raymond Hall and Mr. John M. Legler. I am  grateful to Dr. Laurence C. Stuart for many helpful suggestions and to  Dr. Norman E.
