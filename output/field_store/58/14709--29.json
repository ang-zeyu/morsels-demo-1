Outside the Tabernacle, but within its enclosing court, stood the  altar of sacrifice and the laver or font. The first apartment of the  Tabernacle proper was an outer room, or Holy Place; and beyond this,  screened from observation by the second veil, was the inner sanctuary,  the Most Holy Place, specifically known as the Holy of Holies. In the  appointed order, only the priests were permitted to enter the outer  apartment; while to the inner place, the \"holiest of all,\" none but the  high priest might be admitted, and he but once a year, and then only  after a long course of purification and sanctification.[3]    Among the most sacred appurtenances of the Tabernacle was the Ark  of the Covenant. This was a casket or chest, made of the best wood  obtainable, lined and overlaid with pure gold, and provided with four  rings of gold to receive the rods or poles used in carrying the Ark  during travel. The Ark contained certain objects of sacred import, such  as the golden pot of manna, preserved as a remembrance; and to this  were afterward added Aaron's rod that had budded, and the tablets of  stone inscribed by the hand of God. When the Tabernacle was set up in  the camp of Israel, the Ark was placed within the inner veil, in the  Holy of Holies. Resting upon the Ark was the Mercy Seat, surmounted by  a pair of cherubim made {5} of beaten gold. From this seat did the Lord  manifest His presence, even as promised before either Ark or Tabernacle  had been made: \"And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune  with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims  which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will  give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.\"[4]    No detailed description of the Tabernacle, its appurtenances or  furniture, will be attempted at this place; it is sufficient for our  present purpose to know that the camp of Israel had such a sanctuary;  that it was constructed according to revealed plan; that it was the  embodiment of the best the people could give both as to material and  workmanship; that it was the offering of the people to their God, and  was duly accepted by Him.[5] As shall yet be shown, the Tabernacle  was a prototype of the more stable and magnificent Temple by which in  course of time it was superseded.    After Israel had become established in the land of promise, when,  after four decades of wandering in the wilderness, the covenant people  possessed at last a Canaan of their own, the Tabernacle with its sacred  contents was given a resting place in Shiloh; and thither came the  tribes to learn the will and word of God.[6] Afterward it was removed  to Gibeon[7] and yet later to the City of David, or Zion.[8]    {6} David, the second king of Israel, desired and planned to build a  house unto the Lord, declaring that it was unfit that he, the king,  should dwell in a palace of cedar, while the sanctuary of God was but  a tent.[9] But the Lord spake by the mouth of Nathan the prophet,  declining the proposed offering, and making plain the fact that to be  acceptable unto Him it was not enough that the gift be appropriate,  but that the giver must also be worthy. David, king of Israel, though  in many respects a man after God's own heart, had sinned; and his sin  had not yet found atonement. Thus spake the king: \"I had in mine heart  to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and  for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: But  God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because  thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.\"[10] Nevertheless,  David was permitted to gather material for the House of the Lord, which  edifice not he, but Solomon, his son, should build.    Soon after Solomon's accession to the throne he set about the labor,  which, as heritage and honor, had come to him with his crown. He laid  the foundation in the fourth year of his reign, and the building  was completed within seven years and a half. With the great wealth  accumulated by his kingly father and specifically reserved for the  building of the Temple, Solomon was able to put the known world under  tribute, and to enlist the co-operation of nations in his great  undertaking. The temple workmen numbered scores of thousands, and every  department was in charge of master craftsmen. To serve on the {7} great  structure in any capacity was an honor; and labor acquired a dignity  never before recognized. Masonry became a profession, and the graded  orders therein established have endured until this day. The erection  of the Temple of Solomon was an epoch-making event, not alone in the  history of Israel, but in that of the world.    According to commonly accepted chronology, the Temple was finished  about 1005 B. C. In architecture and construction, in design and  costliness, it is known as one of the most remarkable buildings in  history. The dedicatory services lasted seven days--a week of holy  rejoicing in Israel. With fitting ceremony, the Tabernacle of the  Congregation and the sacred Ark of the Covenant were brought into the  Temple; and the Ark was deposited in the inner sanctuary, the Most  Holy Place. The Lord's gracious acceptance was manifest in the cloud  that filled the sacred chambers as the priests withdrew: \"So that the  priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the  glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.\"[11] Thus did the Temple  supersede and include the Tabernacle, of which, indeed, it was the  gorgeous successor.    A comparison of the plan of Solomon's Temple with that of the earlier  Tabernacle shows that in all essentials of arrangement and proportion  the two were so nearly alike as to be practically identical. True,  the Tabernacle had but one enclosure, while the Temple was surrounded  by courts, but the inner structure itself, the Temple proper, closely  followed the earlier design. The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, the  Holy Place, {8} and the Porch, were in the Temple exactly double those  of the corresponding parts in the Tabernacle.    The glorious pre-eminence of this splendid structure was of brief  duration. Thirty-four years after its dedication, and but five years  subsequent to the death of Solomon, its decline began; and this  decline was soon to develop into general spoliation, and finally to  become an actual desecration. Solomon the king, the man of wisdom, the  master-builder, had been led astray by the wiles of idolatrous women,  and his wayward ways had fostered iniquity in Israel. The nation was  no longer a unit; there were factions and sects, parties and creeds,  some worshipping on the hill-tops, others under green trees, each party  claiming excellence for its own particular shrine. The Temple soon lost  its sanctity. The gift became depreciated by the perfidy of the giver,  and Jehovah withdrew His protecting presence from the place no longer  holy.    The Egyptians, from whose bondage the people had been delivered, were  again permitted to oppress Israel. Shishak, king of Egypt, captured  Jerusalem--the city of David and the site of the Temple--\"and he  took away the treasures of the house of the Lord.\"[12] Part of the  aforetime sacred furniture left by the Egyptians was taken by others,  and bestowed upon idols.[13] The work of desecration continued through  centuries. Two hundred and sixteen years after the Egyptian spoliation,  Ahaz, king of Judah, robbed the Temple of some remaining treasures,  and sent part of its remnant of gold and silver as a present to a  pagan king whose favor he sought to {9} gain. Furthermore, he removed  the altar and the font, and left but a house where once had stood a  Temple.[14] Later, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, completed the  despoiling of the Temple, and carried away its few remaining treasures.  He then destroyed the building itself by fire.[15]    Thus, about six hundred years before the earthly advent of our Lord,  Israel was left without a Temple. The people had divided; there were  two kingdoms--Israel and Judah--each at enmity with the other; they had  become idolatrous and altogether wicked; the Lord had rejected them  and their sanctuary. The Kingdom of Israel, comprising approximately  ten of the twelve tribes, had been made subject to Assyria about 721  B. C., and a century later the Kingdom of Judah was subdued by the  Babylonians. For seventy years the people of Judah--thereafter known  as Jews--remained in captivity, even as had been predicted.[16] Then,  under the friendly rule of Cyrus[17] and Darius[18] they were permitted  to return to Jerusalem, and once more to rear a Temple in accordance  with their faith. In remembrance of the director of the work, the  restored Temple is known in history as the Temple of Zerubbabel. The  foundations were laid with solemn ceremony; and on that occasion  living veterans who remembered the earlier Temple, wept with joy.[19]  In spite of legal technicalities[20] and other obstructions, the  work {10} continued, and within twenty years after their return from  captivity the Jews had a Temple ready for dedication. The Temple of  Zerubbabel was finished 515 B. C., specifically on the third day of  the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.  The dedicatory services followed immediately.[21] While this Temple  was greatly inferior in richness of finish and furniture as compared  with the splendid Temple of Solomon, it was nevertheless the best the  people could build, and the Lord accepted it as an offering typifying  the love and devotion of His covenant children. In proof of this Divine  acceptance, witness the ministrations of such prophets as Zechariah,  Haggai, and Malachi, within its walls.    About sixteen years before the birth of Christ, Herod I, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#2)"],[1,"contents. By its means, and with the aid of  Caoutchouc, we connect our vessels and tubes of glass, and construct  the most complicated apparatus. We form joints and links of  connexion, adapt large apertures to small, and thus dispense  altogether with the aid of the brassfounder and the mechanist. Thus  the implements of the chemist are cheaply and easily procured,  immediately adapted to any purpose, and readily repaired or altered.    Again, in investigating the composition of solid bodies,--of  minerals,--we are under the necessity of bringing them into a liquid  state, either by solution or fusion. Now vessels of glass, of  porcelain, and of all non-metallic substances, are destroyed by the  means we employ for that purpose,--are acted upon by many acids, by  alkalies and the alkaline carbonates. Crucibles of gold and silver  would melt at high temperatures. But we have a combination of all  the qualities we can desire in Platinum. This metal was only first  adapted to these uses about fifty years since. It is cheaper than  gold, harder and more durable than silver, infusible at all  temperatures of our furnaces, and is left intact by acids and  alkaline carbonates. Platinum unites all the valuable properties of  gold and of porcelain, resisting the action of heat, and of almost  all chemical agents.    As no mineral analysis could be made perfectly without platinum  vessels, had we not possessed this metal, the composition of  minerals would have yet remained unknown; without cork and  caoutchouc we should have required the costly aid of the mechanician  at every step. Even without the latter of these adjuncts our  instruments would have been far more costly and fragile. Possessing  all these gifts of nature, we economise incalculably our time--to us  more precious than money!    Such are our instruments. An equal improvement has been accomplished  in our laboratory. This is no longer the damp, cold, fireproof vault  of the metallurgist, nor the manufactory of the druggist, fitted up  with stills and retorts. On the contrary, a light, warm, comfortable  room, where beautifully constructed lamps supply the place of  furnaces, and the pure and odourless flame of gas, or of spirits of  wine, supersedes coal and other fuel, and gives us all the fire we  need; where health is not invaded, nor the free exercise of thought  impeded: there we pursue our inquiries, and interrogate Nature to  reveal her secrets.    To these simple means must be added \"The Balance,\" and then we  possess everything which is required for the most extensive  researches.    The great distinction between the manner of proceeding in chemistry  and natural philosophy is, that one weighs, the other measures. The  natural philosopher has applied his measures to nature for many  centuries, but only for fifty years have we attempted to advance our  philosophy by weighing.    For all great discoveries chemists are indebted to the  \"balance\"--that incomparable instrument which gives permanence to  every observation, dispels all ambiguity, establishes truth, detects  error, and guides us in the true path of inductive science.    The balance, once adopted as a means of investigating nature, put an  end to the school of Aristotle in physics. The explanation of  natural phenomena by mere fanciful speculations, gave place to a  true natural philosophy. Fire, air, earth, and water, could no  longer be regarded as elements. Three of them could henceforth be  considered only as significative of the forms in which all matter  exists. Everything with which we are conversant upon the surface of  the earth is solid, liquid, or aeriform; but the notion of the  elementary nature of air, earth, and water, so universally held, was  now discovered to belong to the errors of the past.    Fire was found to be but the visible and otherwise perceptible  indication of changes proceeding within the, so called, elements.    Lavoisier investigated the composition of the atmosphere and of  water, and studied the many wonderful offices performed by an  element common to both in the scheme of nature, namely, oxygen: and  he discovered many of the properties of this elementary gas.    After his time, the principal problem of chemical philosophers was  to determine the composition of the solid matters composing the  earth. To the eighteen metals previously known were soon added  twenty-four discovered to be constituents of minerals. The great  mass of the earth was shown to be composed of metals in combination  with oxygen, to which they are united in one, two, or more definite  and unalterable proportions, forming compounds which are termed  metallic oxides, and these, again, combined with oxides of other  bodies, essentially different to metals, namely, carbon and  silicium. If to these we add certain compounds of sulphur with  metals, in which the sulphur takes the place of oxygen, and forms  sulphurets, and one other body,--common salt,--(which is a compound  of sodium and chlorine), we have every substance which exists in a  solid form upon our globe in any very considerable mass. Other  compounds, innumerably various, are found only in small scattered  quantities.    The chemist, however, did not remain satisfied with the separation  of minerals into their component elements, i.e. their analysis; but  he sought by synthesis, i.e. by combining the separate elements and  forming substances similar to those constructed by nature, to prove  the accuracy of his processes and the correctness of his  conclusions. Thus he formed, for instance, pumice-stone, feldspar,  mica, iron pyrites, &c. artificially.    But of all the achievements of inorganic chemistry, the artificial  formation of lapis lazuli was the most brilliant and the most  conclusive. This mineral, as presented to us by nature, is  calculated powerfully to arrest our attention by its beautiful  azure-blue colour, its remaining unchanged by exposure to air or to  fire, and furnishing us with a most valuable pigment, Ultramarine,  more precious than gold!    The analysis of lapis lazuli represented it to be composed of  silica, alumina, and soda, three colourless bodies, with sulphur and  a trace of iron. Nothing could be discovered in it of the nature of  a pigment, nothing to which its blue colour could be referred, the  cause of which was searched for in vain. It might therefore have  been supposed that the analyst was here altogether at fault, and  that at any rate its artificial production must be impossible.  Nevertheless, this has been accomplished, and simply by combining in  the proper proportions, as determined by analysis, silica, alumina,  soda, iron, and sulphur. Thousands of pounds weight are now  manufactured from these ingredients, and this artificial ultramarine  is as beautiful as the natural, while for the price of a single  ounce of the latter we may obtain many pounds of the former.    With the production of artificial lapis lazuli, the formation of  mineral bodies by synthesis ceased to be a scientific problem to the  chemist; he has no longer sufficient interest in it to pursue the  subject. He may now be satisfied that analysis will reveal to him  the true constitution of minerals. But to the mineralogist and  geologist it is still in a great measure an unexplored field,  offering inquiries of the highest interest and importance to their  pursuits.    After becoming acquainted with the constituent elements of all the  substances within our reach and the mutual relations of these  elements, the remarkable transmutations to which the bodies are  subject under the influence of the vital powers of plants and  animals, became the principal object of chemical investigations, and  the highest point of interest. A new science, inexhaustible as life  itself, is here presented us, standing upon the sound and solid  foundation of a well established inorganic chemistry. Thus the  progress of science is, like the development of nature's works,  gradual and expansive. After the buds and branches spring forth the  leaves and blossoms, after the blossoms the fruit.    Chemistry, in its application to animals and vegetables, endeavours  jointly with physiology to enlighten us respecting the mysterious  processes and sources of organic life.          LETTER II      My dear Sir,    In my former letter I reminded you that three of the supposed  elements of the ancients represent the forms or state in which all  the ponderable matter of our globe exists; I would now observe, that  no substance possesses absolutely any one of those conditions; that  modern chemistry recognises nothing unchangeably solid, liquid, or  aeriform: means have been devised for effecting a change of state in  almost every known substance. Platinum, alumina, and rock crystal,  it is true, cannot be liquified by the most intense heat of our  furnaces, but they melt like wax before the flame of the  oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. On the other hand, of the twenty-eight  gaseous bodies with which we are acquainted, twenty-five may be  reduced to a liquid state, and one into a solid. Probably, ere long,  similar changes of condition will be extended to every form of  matter.    There are many things relating to this condensation of the gases  worthy of your attention. Most aeriform bodies, when subjected to  compression, are made to occupy a space which diminishes in the  exact ratio of the increase of the compressing force. Very  generally, under a force double or triple of the ordinary  atmospheric pressure, they become one half or one third their former  volume. This was a long time considered to be a law, and known as  the law of Marriotte; but a more accurate study of the subject has  demonstrated that this law is by no means of general application.  The volume of certain gases does not decrease in the ratio of the  increase of the force used to compress them, but in some, a  diminution of their bulk takes place in a far greater degree"]]]
