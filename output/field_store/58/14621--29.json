[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37823"],[0,"Neotropical Hylid Frogs, Genus Smilisca (#2)"],[1,"our study we examined 4151 preserved frogs, 93 skeletal preparations,  88 lots of tadpoles and young, and six lots of eggs. We have collected  specimens in the field of all of the species. Observations on behavior  and life history were begun by the senior author in Mexico in 1956 and  completed by us in Central America in 1964 and 1965.    Osteological data were obtained from dried skeletons and cleaned and  stained specimens of all species, plus serial sections of the skull of  _Smilisca baudini_. Developmental stages to which tadpoles are assigned  are in accordance with the table of development published by Gosner  (1960). Breeding calls were recorded in the field on tape using  Magnemite and Uher portable tape recorders. Audiospectrographs were made  by means of a Vibralyzer (Kay Electric Company). External morphological  features were measured in the manner described by Duellman (1956). In  the accounts of the species we have attempted to give a complete  synonymy. At the end of each species account the localities from which  specimens were examined are listed alphabetically within each state,  province, or department, which in turn are listed alphabetically within  each country. The countries are arranged from north to south.

Conclusion.        The events of 1890-1                                             271                INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR.      These experiences were written in brief intervals of leisure, during  the last few months of the author's busy life, which was brought to  a sudden close before they were finally revised. Only last March when  his nearest relations met at Fulford Hall to take leave of the eldest  son of the house, before he sailed for India, the manuscript was still  incomplete, and Sir James read some part of it aloud. His health had  suffered greatly from over-fatigue in the unhealthy parts of India,  in which his lot had been chiefly cast, but it was now quite restored  and a prolonged period of usefulness seemed before him.    Improvements on the farms on his estate, a church within reach of his  cottagers, to be built as a memorial to his late wife, and the hope  of being once more employed abroad, probably as a colonial governor,  were all plans for the immediate future, while the present was  occupied with the magisterial and other business (including lectures  on history in village institutes), which fill up so much of an English  country gentleman's life. He had saved nothing in India. What the  Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal wrote in 1872 of his early work at  Keonjhur, applied to everything else he subsequently undertook:  \"Captain Johnstone's schools, twenty in number, continue to flourish,  attracting an average attendance of 665 children. Captain Johnstone's  efforts to improve the crops and cattle of Keonjhur have before been  remarked by the Lieutenant-Governor. His sacrifices for this end and  for his charge generally, are, His Honour believes, almost unique.\" [1]  But in 1881 by the death of his late father's elder brother, he  inherited the Fulford estate on the boundaries of Worcestershire and  Warwickshire, as well as Dunsley Manor in Staffordshire. The old Hall  at Fulford, a strongly built, black and white, half-timbered erection  of some centuries back, had been pulled down a few years before,  and Sir James built the present house close to the old site. It was  here that he was brought back in a dying state on June 13th, 1895,  about 10 A.M., after riding out of the grounds only ten minutes  before, full of life and energy. No one witnessed what occurred;  he was a splendid horseman, but there was evidence that the horse,  always inclined to be restive, had taken fright on passing a cottager's  gate and tried to turn back, and that, as its master's whip was still  firmly grasped in his hand, there had been a struggle.    He was engaged to assist the next day at the annual meeting of the  Conservative and Unionist Association at Stratford-on-Avon. The Marquis  of Hertford, who presided, when announcing the catastrophe in very  feeling terms, spoke of the excellent work that Sir James Johnstone  had done for the Unionist cause in Warwickshire. At Wythall Church  (of which he was warden) the Vicar alluded, the following Sunday, to  \"the striking example he had set of a devout and attentive worshipper.\"    A retired official who had been acquainted with him in India for  over thirty years, wrote on the same occasion to Captain Charles  Johnstone, R.N.: \"Your brother was a type of character not at all  common, high-principled, fearless, just, with an overwhelming sense  of duty, and restless spirit of adventure. It is by characters of  his type, that our great empire has been created, and it is only if  such types continue that we may look forward and hope that it will  be maintained and extended.\"    Although the family from which Sir James Johnstone sprang is of  Scottish origin, his own branch of it had lived in Worcestershire  and Warwickshire for nearly a century and a half. \"It has taken a  prominent part in the social and public life of the Midlands, and  has produced several eminent physicians.\" [2] He was the eleventh in  direct male descent from William Johnstone of Graitney, who received  a charter of the barony of Newbie for \"distinguished services\" to  the Scottish crown in 1541. A remnant of the old Scottish estates was  inherited by his great-grandfather, Dr. James Johnstone, who died at  Worcester in 1802, and who, being the fourth son of his parents, had  left Annandale at the age of twenty-one to settle in Worcestershire  as a physician, but who always kept up his relations with Scotland,  and meant to return there in his old age. His anxiety to secure this  estate--Galabank--in the male line, really defeated his purpose; for  he bequeathed it to his then unmarried younger son, the late Dr. John  Johnstone, F.R.S., whose daughter now possesses it, to the exclusion of  his elder"]]]
