It includes, also, all the  scientific discoveries and inventions--agriculture, the mechanical  arts, architecture, shipbuilding, the properties and applications of  the mariner's compass, navigation, and music. All that is useful,  great, and good; all that is calculated to sustain, comfort, instruct,  edify, purify, refine, or exalt intelligences; originated by this  science, and this science alone, all other sciences being but branches  growing out of _this--root_.    Some of the facts stated in the foregoing, are beautifully illustrated  in Theological history, of which the following is an imperfect  summary--    God spake, and the worlds were framed by His word.    He spake, darkness dispersed, and light prevailed.    He commanded, and the elements--water and earth, separated, and  assumed their proper bounds.    He commanded, and the earth brought forth vegetable and animal life in  countless variety.    He commanded, and man, male and female, took upon them a tabernacle of  flesh, and prepared to multiply and perpetuate their species in the  new creation.    \"The Lord God planted a garden,\" and thus introduced agriculture.    \"He made coats of skins,\" hence the tailor's art.    The Lord God commanded and gave pattern for Noah's Ark, thus  introducing the art of shipbuilding.    He revealed the patterns for the Tabernacle in the wilderness, with  all its arrangements and furniture; and afterwards developed the  entire plan and all the designs of that most stupendous of all works  of art--the great Temple of Solomon, with all its furniture; thus  developing and improving the art of architecture.    The Lord God wrote with His own finger on the \"tables of stone,\" on  Mount Sinai; thus showing that the science of letters was cultivated  and used by the highest Intelligence of the eternal heavens.    The Lord God has revealed by Ezekiel the Prophet, a plan for the  survey and division of Palestine to the Twelve Tribes of Israel, on  their return to the land of their fathers; also for laying out the new  city of Jerusalem, with its squares, blocks, public grounds, and  suburbs, and its temple.    Thus Theology includes the surveyor's art, and the planning of cities,  as well as temples, and shows that these arts are cultivated in  heaven, and that the very highest Intelligence of the Heaven of  heavens, stoops, or condescends, to grace these arts by His own  particular attention and example.    In the Revelation of John the Apostle, on the Isle of Patmos, we have  a specimen, a masterpiece, a climax of all that is great and grand in  design, and splendid and glorious in execution, in cities, thrones,  palaces, streets, pavements, outgrounds, gates, walks, squares,  fountains, rivulets, gardens, fruits, groves, specimens of dress,  poetry, song, music, marriage, bridal dress, feasting, books,  literature, public worship, prophesying, prayer, and praise, as  existing in and around the palaces of the New Jerusalem, the capital  of heaven, the seat of government of the Eternal King.    The very gates of the city are numbered and named, together with the  particular names of the precious stones forming the foundations  thereof; the gold which composed the pavement of the streets--all are  portrayed in the description.    And what is still more marvellous, all this surpassing grandeur of  design, and stupendous wisdom and display in execution, were explored,  comprehended, and described by a poor, illiterate fisherman, by the  aid of the science and arts of Theology.    Having reviewed some of the works of the great Head--the President or  First Teacher in the school of Theology, we will still continue the  historic illustrations of this wonderful science, as developed and  exemplified by the most eminent students and professors of the same.    By this science Adam obtained from his Father, the promise of the  eternal dominion over the planet on which he was placed.    By this science Enoch overcame death, and ascended to a higher sphere  of immortality and eternal life, without even being separated from his  fleshly tabernacle.    By this science Noah foretold the flood, prepared to meet the event,  and, with his family, survived the same, and became the greatest  landed proprietor since Adam.    By the perversion and unlawful use of this science king Nimrod built  the stupendous Tower of Babel, but was frustrated, and his works were  destroyed before their completion.    By this science various tongues and languages were instituted, and  colonies--the germs of nations, planted beyond the seas and in all the  earth.    By this science Abraham escaped the idolatry and priestcraft of the  Egyptians, and of the world around him; obtained a good land secured  to him and his seed by an immutable oath, covenant, and an  everlasting, unchangeable title.    By this science he conversed with angels, and was favoured with a  personal interview with the Great Head and Founder of the science, who  became his guest, and, after eating and drinking with him, blessed him  and his wife, promised them an heir in their old age, and finally, on  parting, told him His design on Sodom and its neighbourhood.    By this science Lot escaped the flames of Sodom, the knowledge being  communicated by two angels.    By this science Isaac and Jacob also obtained promises, and conversed  with angels.    By it Joseph was exalted from a dungeon to a palace, for the  salvation, from famine, of a nation and of his father's house.    By this science Moses performed his wonders in Egypt, in the Red Sea,  and in the wilderness.    By the perversion and unlawful use of this science the magicians of  Egypt withstood Moses for a time, and performed their enchantments.    By this science Joshua controlled the motions of the earth, and  lengthened out the day by a simple command.    By this science the walls of Jericho were levelled with the earth, and  the city was taken.    By this science the Jordan river was divided, while a nation crossed  dry shod, to take possession of the promised land.    By this science Elijah controlled the heavens, that it rained not for  three years and six months in Palestine. And by it he called forth and  restored rain.    By it he overthrew the priests of Baal, and the kingdom of Ahab; put  an end to the royal family of this idolatrous king; and placed Jehu on  the throne.    By it he rose, like Enoch, to a higher sphere, without returning to  dust.    By this science Samuel prophesied, raised up a mighty king and nation,  and afterwards dethroned Saul, and exalted an obscure shepherd boy to  the throne of Israel.    By this science Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and others,  foretold the fate of Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, Jerusalem, and other cities  and nations; and the exact career and final doom of Nebuchadnezzar,  Belteshazzar, Cyrus, and other great and important personages, who  were destined in turn to influence and decide the fate of nations.    By this science the furnace of fire was overcome, and the months of  lions were closed, that no harm should befall the holy men of God.    By this science Zachariah, Elizabeth, John the Baptist, Simeon, Anna,  Joseph, Mary, the wise men from the east, and the shepherds of Judea,  enjoyed visions, communion with angels, and the spirit of prophecy, so  as to understand and welcome with joy the events of the birth and  approaching ministry of Jesus Christ, when, as yet, all those not  versed in this science, were in darkness on the subject, and as liable  to reject the Saviour as to receive him.    Dreams and visions, enjoyed by means of this science, led and  protected the Son of God in all his career of mortal life.    Finally--By this same power a mighty angel descended, shook the earth,  frightened the Roman guards, rolled away the great stone, broke the  seal of the tomb, and called to life the sleeping body of Jesus  Christ.    By this power the risen Jesus, eating, drinking, and conversing with  his disciples, after his resurrection, commissioned and instructed  them in the same science, ordained them to act in the same, and to  impart its power to others, in all the world, with signs following  them that believed.    By this science he ascended to the Father, and lives for ever in the  flesh, to shed forth the gifts and powers of the same science,  according to his own will, and the will of his Father, to reign  henceforth until he descends to the earth, conquers death in a last  great conflict, and puts all enemies under his feet.    By this same power his Apostles, being clothed with the full powers of  the same on the day of Pentecost, ministered the powers and knowledge  of this science to others, both Jew and Gentile, insomuch that the  sick were healed, the blind saw, the dumb spake, the deaf heard, the  lame walked, devils were cast out, and the dead were raised, while  everywhere, dreams, visions, the ministering of angels, and the gift  of prophecy were enjoyed.          CHAPTER II.    DECLINE AND LOSS OF THIS SCIENCE AMONG THE JEWS.          O horrid! awful! melancholy sight!      A nation, wont to soar 'mid realms of light,      Degraded, fallen, sunk in dark despair,      The hiss, the scorn, the bye-word everywhere;      No eye to pity, and no arm to save,      Till wearied nature finds an exile's grave.    It now becomes our painful task to trace the decline of the science of  Theology and its powers among the nations, and to review the awful  consequences of such decline.    We will commence with the Jewish nation.    The science of Theology, as we have just reviewed, was enjoyed, and  its powers were wonderfully developed, under the several dispensations  called Patriarchal, Mosaic, and Jewish.    There had, however, been a great decline, a retrogression of the  powers and knowledge of the same, previous to their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35490"],[0,"Seaside Studies in Natural History.
