Thus it happened that opportunity  was left to a private individual, the munificent Sir Thomas Bodley, to  attach an individual name to one of the famous libraries of the world.  It is interesting to learn that municipal bodies have a share in the  honor due to monasteries and sovereigns in the collection of books;  for the Common Council of Aix purchased books for a public library in  1419.[10]    Louis the Fourteenth, of evil memory, has at least this one good deed  to his credit, that he raised the Royal Library at Paris, founded two  centuries before, to 70,000 volumes. In 1791 it had 150,000 volumes. It  profited largely by the Revolution. The British Museum had only reached  115,000 when Panizzi became keeper in 1837. Nineteen years afterward he  left it with 560,000, a number which must now have more than doubled.  By his noble design for occupying the central quadrangle, a desert  of gravel until his time, he provided additional room for 1,200,000  volumes. All this apparently enormous space for development is being  eaten up with fearful rapidity; and such is the greed of the splendid  library that it opens its jaws like Hades, and threatens shortly to  expel the antiquities from the building, and appropriate the places they  adorn.    But the proper office of hasty retrospect in a paper like this is  only to enlarge by degrees, like the pupil of an eye, the reader's  contemplation and estimate of the coming time, and to prepare him for  some practical suggestions of a very humble kind. So I take up again the  thread of my brief discourse. National libraries draw upon a purse which  is bottomless. But all public libraries are not national. And the case  even of private libraries is becoming, nay, has become, very serious for  all who are possessed by the inexorable spirit of collection, but whose  ardor is perplexed and qualified, or even baffled, by considerations  springing from the balance-sheet.    The purchase of a book is commonly supposed to end, even for the most  scrupulous customer, with the payment of the bookseller's bill. But this  is a mere popular superstition. Such payment is not the last, but the  first term in a series of goodly length. If we wish to give to the block  a lease of life equal to that of the pages, the first condition is that  it should be bound. So at least one would have said half a century ago.  But, while books are in the most instances cheaper, binding, from causes  which I do not understand, is dearer, at least in England, than it was  in my early years, so that few can afford it.[11] We have, however,  the tolerable and very useful expedient of cloth binding (now in some  danger, I fear, of losing its modesty through flaring ornamentation) to  console us. Well, then, bound or not, the book must of necessity be put  into a bookcase. And the bookcase must be housed. And the house must  be kept. And the library must be dusted, must be arranged, should be  catalogued. What a vista of toil, yet not unhappy toil! Unless indeed  things are to be as they now are in at least one princely mansion of  this country, where books, in thousands upon thousands, are jumbled  together with no more arrangement than a sack of coals; where not  even the sisterhood of consecutive volumes has been respected; where  undoubtedly an intending reader may at the mercy of Fortune take  something from the shelves that is a book; but where no particular book  can except by the purest accident, be found.    Such being the outlook, what are we to do with our books? Shall we  be buried under them like Tarpeia under the Sabine shields? Shall  we renounce them (many will, or will do worse, will keep to the most  worthless part of them) in our resentment against their more and more  exacting demands? Shall we sell and scatter them? as it is painful  to see how often the books of eminent men are ruthlessly, or at least  unhappily, dispersed on their decease. Without answering in detail, I  shall assume that the book-buyer is a book-lover, that his love is a  tenacious, not a transitory love, and that for him the question is how  best to keep his books.    I pass over those conditions which are the most obvious, that the  building should be sound and dry, the apartment airy, and with abundant  light. And I dispose with a passing anathema of all such as would  endeavour to solve their problem, or at any rate compromise their  difficulties, by setting one row of books in front of another. I  also freely admit that what we have before us is not a choice between  difficulty and no difficulty, but a choice among difficulties.    The objects further to be contemplated in the bestowal of our books,  so far as I recollect, are three: economy, good arrangement, and  accessibility with the smallest possible expenditure of time.    In a private library, where the service of books is commonly to be  performed by the person desiring to use them, they ought to be assorted  and distributed according to subject. The case may be altogether  different where they have to be sent for and brought by an attendant.  It is an immense advantage to bring the eye in aid of the mind; to see  within a limited compass all the works that are accessible, in a given  library, on a given subject; and to have the power of dealing with them  collectively at a given spot, instead of hunting them up through an  entire accumulation. It must be admitted, however, that distribution by  subjects ought in some degree to be controlled by sizes. If everything  on a given subject, from folio down to 32mo, is to be brought locally  together, there will be an immense waste of space in the attempt to  lodge objects of such different sizes in one and the same bookcase. And  this waste of space will cripple us in the most serious manner, as will  be seen with regard to the conditions of economy and of accessibility.  The three conditions are in truth all connected together, but especially  the two last named.    Even in a paper such as this the question of classification cannot  altogether be overlooked; but it is one more easy to open than to  close--one upon which I am not bold enough to hope for uniformity of  opinion and of practice. I set aside on the one hand the case of great  public libraries, which I leave to the experts of those establishments.  And, at the other end of the scale, in small private libraries the  matter becomes easy or even insignificant. In libraries of the medium  scale, not too vast for some amount of personal survey, some would  multiply subdivision, and some restrain it. An acute friend asks me  under what and how many general headings subjects should be classified  in a library intended for practical use and reading, and boldly answers  by suggesting five classes only: (1) science, (2) speculation, (3) art,  (4) history, and (5) miscellaneous and periodical literature. But this  seemingly simple division at once raises questions both of practical and  of theoretic difficulty. As to the last, periodical literature is fast  attaining to such magnitude, that it may require a classification of  its own, and that the enumeration which indexes supply, useful as it is,  will not suffice. And I fear it is the destiny of periodicals as such to  carry down with them a large proportion of what, in the phraseology of  railways, would be called dead weight, as compared with live weight. The  limits of speculation would be most difficult to draw. The  diversities included under science would be so vast as at once to make  sub-classification a necessity. The ologies are by no means well suited  to rub shoulders together; and sciences must include arts, which are but  country cousins to them, or a new compartment must be established  for their accommodation. Once more, how to cope with the everlasting  difficulty of 'Works'? In what category to place Dante, Petrarch,  Swedenborg, Burke, Coleridge, Carlyle, or a hundred more? Where, again,  is Poetry to stand? I apprehend that it must take its place, the first  place without doubt, in Art; for while it is separated from Painting and  her other 'sphere-born harmonious sisters' by their greater dependence  on material forms they are all more inwardly and profoundly united  in their first and all-enfolding principle, which is to organize the  beautiful for presentation to the perceptions of man.    But underneath all particular criticism of this or that method of  classification will be found to lie a subtler question--whether the  arrangement of a library ought not in some degree to correspond with  and represent the mind of the man who forms it. For my own part, I plead  guilty, within certain limits, of favoritism in classification. I  am sensible that sympathy and its reverse have something to do with  determining in what company a book shall stand. And further, does  there not enter into the matter a principle of humanity to the authors  themselves? Ought we not to place them, so far as may be, in the  neighborhood which they would like? Their living manhoods are printed  in their works. Every reality, every tendency, endures. Eadem sequitur  tellure sepultos.    I fear that arrangement, to be good, must be troublesome. Subjects are  traversed by promiscuous assemblages of 'works;' both by sizes; and  all by languages. On the whole I conclude as follows. The mechanical  perfection of a library requires an alphabetical catalogue of the whole.  But under the shadow of this catalogue let there be as many living  integers as possible, for every well-chosen subdivision is a living  integer and makes the library more and more an organism. Among others I  plead for individual men as centres of subdivision: not only for Homer,  Dante, Shakespeare, but for Johnson, Scott, and Burns, and whatever  represents a large and manifold humanity.    The question of economy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34294"],[0,"Birds Illustrated (#2)"],[1,"herding of cattle and swine and driving them together to the  common pasture prevailed, was very much to their taste. They soon knew  all the inhabitants in the place and used to call regularly at the  houses to be fed. Then the female died and the survivor at once took as  a new friend a bull. He stood by the bull in the stall and kept the  flies off him, screamed when he roared, danced before him and followed  him out with the herd. In this association the Crane learned the duties  of cowherd, so that one evening he brought home the whole of the village  herd of heifers unaided and drove them into the stable. From that time  the Crane undertook so many duties that he was busy from dawn till  night. He acted as policeman among the poultry, stopping all fights and  disorder. He stood by a horse when left in a cart and prevented it from  moving by pecking its nose and screaming. A Turkey and a Game Cock were  found fighting, whereon the Crane first fought the Turkey, then sought  out and thrashed the cock. Meantime it herded the cattle, not always  with complete success. The bovines were collected in the morning by the  sound of a horn and some would lag behind. On one occasion the Crane  went back, drove up some lagging heifers through the street and then  frightened them so much that they broke away and ran two miles in the  wrong direction. The bird could not bring them back, but drove them  into a field, where it guarded them until they were fetched. It would  drive out trespassing cattle as courageously as a dog and, unlike  most busybodies, was a universal favorite and pride of the  village.--_Cornhill Magazine._           [Illustration: From col.

Throughout the whole of temperate North America and tropical America to  Brazil, this, the smallest of the Bittern family, is a well-known bird,  but being a nocturnal species, inhabiting the almost inaccessible swamps  and boggy lands that are covered with a dense growth of canes, reeds,  and rushes, it is seldom met with. Mr. Davis calls it an extremely  interesting little bird, of quiet, retiring habits. In some places as  many as a dozen or twenty pairs breed along the grassy shores of a small  lake or pond. The nest is placed on the ground or in the midst of the  rankest grass, or in a bush. It is often placed on floating bog, and is  simply a platform of dead rushes.    This bird has many odd habits. When standing on the edge of a stream,  with its neck drawn in, it is often taken for a Woodcock, the long bill  giving it this appearance. It is so stupid at times that it may be  caught with the hand.    The Least Bittern is usually seen just before or after sunset. When  startled it utters a low _gua_, and in daylight flies but a short  distance, in a weak, uncertain manner, but at dusk it flaps along on  strong easy wing, with neck drawn in and legs extended.    The eggs of this species are usually from two to six in number, and of a  pale bluish or greenish-white. If approached while on the nest, the  female generally steps quietly to one side, but if suddenly surprised,  takes to flight.    The Least Bittern is known by many local names. In Jamaica it is called  Tortoise-shell Bird and Minute Bittern, and in many localities Little  Bittern.           *       *       *       *       *        \"All Nature is a unit in herself,      Yet but a part of a far greater whole.

Well, some of the  other Ducks pitied the little prisoner and tried to release him by  forcing their necks under the crate and thus lifting it up. They found  they weren't strong enough to do that, and so they _quacked_, and  _quacked_, and _quacked_ among themselves, then marched away in a body.  Soon they came back with forty ducks, every one in the farm yard. They  surrounded the crate and tried to lift it as before, but again they  failed. Then they _quacked_ some more, and after a long talk the whole  of them went to one side of the crate. As many as could thrust their  necks underneath it, and the rest pushed them forward from behind. A  good push, a strong push, up went the crate a little way, and out  waddled the little prisoner. I want to know if they didn't reason that  out, mamma?\"           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  BALDPATE DUCK.

We would have you to wit, that on eggs though we sit,        And are spiked on a spit, and are baked in a pan,      Birds are older by far than your ancestors are,        And made love and made war, ere the making of man!                                              --ANDREW LANG.      There is much variation in the plumage of adult males of this species  of Widgeon, but as Dr. Coues says: \"The bird cannot be mistaken under  any condition; the extensive white of the under parts and wings is  recognizable at gun-range.\" The female is similar, but lacks the white  crown and iridescence on the head.    The Baldpate ranges over the whole of North America. In winter it is  common in the Gulf states and lower part of the Mississippi Valley.  Cooke says it breeds chiefly in the north, but is known to nest in  Manitoba, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and Texas.  Throughout the whole of British America, as far north as the Arctic  ocean, it is very abundant. In October and April it visits in large  numbers the rivers and marshes, as well as both sea coasts of the  northern United States, and is much sought by hunters, its flesh being  of the finest quality, as when in good condition it cannot easily be  distinguished from that of the Canvas-back. It is regarded by hunters as  a great nuisance. It is not only so shy that it avoids the points of  land, but by its whistling and confused manner of flight is said to  alarm the other species. During its stay in the waters of the  Chesapeake, it is the constant companion of the Canvas-backs, upon  whose superiority in diving it depends in a large degree for its food,  stealing from them, as they rise to the surface of the water, the tender  roots of the plant of which both are so fond--_vallisneria_ grass, or  wild celery. The Baldpate is said to visit the rice fields of the south  during the winter in considerable numbers. It winters in the Southern  states, Mexico, and the West Indies. In the north, the Widgeon exhibits  a greater preference for rivers and open lakes than most of the other  fresh-water Ducks.    The favorite situation of the nest is remarkable, for while the other  Ducks--except, perhaps, the Teal, according to Mr. Kennicott--choose the  immediate vicinity of water, he found the Baldpate always breeding at a  considerable distance from it. Several of the nests observed on the  Yukon were fully half a mile from the nearest water. He invariably found  the nest among dry leaves, upon high, dry ground, either under large  trees or in thick groves of small ones--frequently among thick spruces.  The nest is small, simply a depression among the leaves, but thickly  lined with down, with which after setting is begun, the eggs are covered  when left by the parent. They are from eight to twelve in number, and  pale buff. The food of the Baldpate consists of aquatic insects, small  shells, and the seeds and roots of various plants.    The call of this bird is a plaintive whistle of two and then three notes  of nearly equal duration. Col. N. S. Goss states that, as a rule,  Widgeons \"are not shy, and their note, a sort of _whew, whew, whew_,  uttered while feeding and swimming, enables the hunter to locate them in  the thickest growth of water plants.\"          WOOING BIRDS' ODD WAYS.      Of all the interesting points on which Mr. Dixon touches in his  \"Curiosities of Bird Life,\" perhaps none is more remarkable than the  strange antics in which some birds indulge,"]]]
