For  centuries it was a capital thatched with heather, and more than once, in  the evil days of English invasion, it has gone up in flame to heaven, a  beacon to ships at sea.  It was the jousting-ground of jealous nobles,  not only on Greenside, or by the King's Stables, where set tournaments  were fought to the sound of trumpets and under the authority of the royal  presence, but in every alley where there was room to cross swords, and in  the main street, where popular tumult under the Blue Blanket alternated  with the brawls of outlandish clansmen and retainers.  Down in the palace  John Knox reproved his queen in the accents of modern democracy.  In the  town, in one of those little shops plastered like so many swallows' nests  among the buttresses of the old Cathedral, that familiar autocrat, James  VI., would gladly share a bottle of wine with George Heriot the  goldsmith.  Up on the Pentland Hills, that so quietly look down on the  Castle with the city lying in waves around it, those mad and dismal  fanatics, the Sweet Singers, haggard from long exposure on the moors, sat  day and night with 'tearful psalmns' to see Edinburgh consumed with fire  from heaven, like another Sodom or Gomorrah.  There, in the Grass-market,  stiff-necked, covenanting heroes, offered up the often unnecessary, but  not less honourable, sacrifice of their lives, and bade eloquent farewell  to sun, moon, and stars, and earthly friendships, or died silent to the  roll of drums.  Down by yon outlet rode Grahame of Claverhouse and his  thirty dragoons, with the town beating to arms behind their horses'  tails--a sorry handful thus riding for their lives, but with a man at the  head who was to return in a different temper, make a dash that staggered  Scotland to the heart, and die happily in the thick of fight.  There  Aikenhead was hanged for a piece of boyish incredulity; there, a few  years afterwards, David Hume ruined Philosophy and Faith, an undisturbed  and well-reputed citizen; and thither, in yet a few years more, Burns  came from the plough-tail, as to an academy of gilt unbelief and  artificial letters.  There, when the great exodus was made across the  valley, and the New Town began to spread abroad its draughty  parallelograms, and rear its long frontage on the opposing hill, there  was such a flitting, such a change of domicile and dweller, as was never  excelled in the history of cities: the cobbler succeeded the earl; the  beggar ensconced himself by the judge's chimney; what had been a palace  was used as a pauper refuge; and great mansions were so parcelled out  among the least and lowest in society, that the hearthstone of the old  proprietor was thought large enough to be partitioned off into a bedroom  by the new.          CHAPTER II. OLD TOWN--THE LANDS.      The Old Town, it is pretended, is the chief characteristic, and, from a  picturesque point of view, the liver-wing of Edinburgh.  It is one of the  most common forms of depreciation to throw cold water on the whole by  adroit over-commendation of a part, since everything worth judging,  whether it be a man, a work of art, or only a fine city, must be judged  upon its merits as a whole.  The Old Town depends for much of its effect  on the new quarters that lie around it, on the sufficiency of its  situation, and on the hills that back it up.  If you were to set it  somewhere else by itself, it would look remarkably like Stirling in a  bolder and loftier edition.  The point is to see this embellished  Stirling planted in the midst of a large, active, and fantastic modern  city; for there the two re-act in a picturesque sense, and the one is the  making of the other.    The Old Town occupies a sloping ridge or tail of diluvial matter,  protected, in some subsidence of the waters, by the Castle cliffs which  fortify it to the west.  On the one side of it and the other the new  towns of the south and of the north occupy their lower, broader, and more  gentle hill-tops.  Thus, the quarter of the Castle over-tops the whole  city and keeps an open view to sea and land.  It dominates for miles on  every side; and people on the decks of ships, or ploughing in quiet  country places over in Fife, can see the banner on the Castle  battlements, and the smoke of the Old Town blowing abroad over the  subjacent country.  A city that is set upon a hill.  It was, I suppose,  from this distant aspect that she got her nickname of _Auld Reekie_.  Perhaps it was given her by people who had never crossed her doors: day  after day, from their various rustic Pisgahs, they had seen the pile of  building on the hill-top, and the long plume of smoke over the plain; so  it appeared to them; so it had appeared to their fathers tilling the same  field; and as that was all they knew of the place, it could be all  expressed in these two words.                  [Picture: Cowfeeder Row and Head of West Port]    Indeed, even on a nearer view, the Old Town is properly smoked; and  though it is well washed with rain all the year round, it has a grim and  sooty aspect among its younger suburbs.  It grew, under the law that  regulates the growth of walled cities in precarious situations, not in  extent, but in height and density.  Public buildings were forced,  wherever there was room for them, into the midst of thoroughfares;  thorough--fares were diminished into lanes; houses sprang up story after  story, neighbour mounting upon neighbour's shoulder, as in some Black  Hole of Calcutta, until the population slept fourteen or fifteen deep in  a vertical direction.  The tallest of these _lands_, as they are locally  termed, have long since been burnt out; but to this day it is not  uncommon to see eight or ten windows at a flight; and the cliff of  building which hangs imminent over Waverley Bridge would still put many  natural precipices to shame.  The cellars are already high above the  gazer's head, planted on the steep hill-side; as for the garret, all the  furniture may be in the pawn-shop, but it commands a famous prospect to  the Highland hills.  The poor man may roost up there in the centre of  Edinburgh, and yet have a peep of the green country from his window; he  shall see the quarters of the well-to-do fathoms underneath, with their  broad squares and gardens; he shall have nothing overhead but a few  spires, the stone top-gallants of the city; and perhaps the wind may  reach him with a rustic pureness, and bring a smack of the sea or of  flowering lilacs in the spring.    It is almost the correct literary sentiment to deplore the revolutionary  improvements of Mr. Chambers and his following.  It is easy to be a  conservator of the discomforts of others; indeed, it is only our good  qualities we find it irksome to conserve.  Assuredly, in driving streets  through the black labyrinth, a few curious old corners have been swept  away, and some associations turned out of house and home.  But what  slices of sunlight, what breaths of clean air, have been let in!  And  what a picturesque world remains untouched!  You go under dark arches,  and down dark stairs and alleys.  The way is so narrow that you can lay a  hand on either wall; so steep that, in greasy winter weather, the  pavement is almost as treacherous as ice.  Washing dangles above washing  from the windows; the houses bulge outwards upon flimsy brackets; you see  a bit of sculpture in a dark corner; at the top of all, a gable and a few  crowsteps are printed on the sky.  Here, you come into a court where the  children are at play and the grown people sit upon their doorsteps, and  perhaps a church spire shows itself above the roofs.  Here, in the  narrowest of the entry, you find a great old mansion still erect, with  some insignia of its former state--some scutcheon, some holy or  courageous motto, on the lintel.  The local antiquary points out where  famous and well-born people had their lodging; and as you look up, out  pops the head of a slatternly woman from the countess's window.  The  Bedouins camp within Pharaoh's palace walls, and the old war-ship is  given over to the rats.  We are already a far way from the days when  powdered heads were plentiful in these alleys, with jolly, port-wine  faces underneath.  Even in the chief thoroughfares Irish washings flutter  at the windows, and the pavements are encumbered with loiterers.                  [Picture: Old Bow-Head, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh]    These loiterers are a true character of the scene.  Some shrewd Scotch  workmen may have paused on their way to a job, debating Church affairs  and politics with their tools upon their arm.  But the most part are of a  different order--skulking jail-birds; unkempt, bare-foot children;  big-mouthed, robust women, in a sort of uniform of striped flannel  petticoat and short tartan shawl; among these, a few surpervising  constables and a dismal sprinkling of mutineers and broken men from  higher ranks in society, with some mark of better days upon them, like a  brand.  In a place no larger than Edinburgh, and where the traffic is  mostly centred in five or six chief streets, the same face comes often  under the notice of an idle stroller.  In fact, from this point of view,  Edinburgh is not so much a small city as the largest of small towns.  It  is scarce possible to avoid observing your neighbours; and I never yet  heard of any one who tried.  It has been my fortune, in this anonymous  accidental way, to watch more than one of these downward travellers for  some stages on the road to ruin.  One man must have been upwards of sixty  before I first observed him, and he made then a decent, personable figure  in broad-cloth of the best.  For three years he kept falling--grease  coming and buttons going from the square-skirted coat, the face puffing  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#2)"],[1,"develope in different order, in      different groups.--Suppressed stages.--Apod condition of      _Phryganea_; of _Aphis_; of      _Chrysopa_.--Libellulidae.--_Donacia_.--Spiders.--Myriapods.--Apod      stage of Homomorphous Insects once probably longer than      now.--Suppression of embryonic stages.--Metamorphoses of      Hydroida, Crustacea, Isopods, and      Amphipods.--Echinoderms.--Variations in development induced by      the influence of external conditions.                    _page_ 41-62        CHAPTER IV.
