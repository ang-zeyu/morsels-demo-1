AUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      The article \"Fly Fishing for Trout,\" I contributed in its original  form to _Sports Afield_, Mr. Claude King's Western journal.    The article \"Trout and Trouting,\" as I originally prepared it, was  entitled \"Near-by Trout Streams,\" and was written for and published in  _Outing_, when I was field editor of that delightful magazine.    \"Trouting in Canadensis Valley\" is rewritten from a little story of  mine penned at the suggestion of the noted angler and ichthyologist,  the late William C. Harris, and published by him in his _The American  Angler_ when I became his managing editor.    \"Trout Flies, Artificial and Natural\" and \"The Brook Trout Incognito\"  are elaborations of studies I composed for _Forest and Stream_.    And many of the items in \"Little Casts,\" etc., are from a collection  of paragraphs I have contributed to the New York _Herald_, the New  York _Press_, and various sporting periodicals in past years.    The extracts from the article by Willis Boyd Allen are reprinted by  permission of _Scribner's Magazine_.    For the little pen-and-ink sketches I am indebted to our jovial  artist, Leppert.    The picture, \"Taking the Fly,\" is a reproduction from an etching in my  possession, presented to me by Mr. William M. Carey, whose etchings  and paintings in oil are well known to American sportsmen.    \"The Fly Rod's Victim\" is reproduced from a photograph framed in  birch bark and presented to me by the poet, Isaac McLellan.    \"The Brook Trout\" illustration is from a photograph of a captive  specimen in an aquarium, the engraving being loaned me by the late  John P. Burkhard.

But it      seems that He must have been busy in their behalf while he was      waiting; for there was a bright fire of coals on the shore, and a      goodly fish broiling thereon, and bread to eat with it. And when      the Master had asked them about their fishing he said: 'Come, now,      and get your breakfast.' So they sat down around the fire, and      with His own hands he served them with the bread and the      fish.\"--HENRY VAN DYKE.        \"The first men that our Saviour dear      Did choose to wait upon Him here.      Blest fishers were....\"                                    W. BASSE.        \"I would ... fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with      stars.\"--THOREAU.      The principal fishes of the Sea of Galilee to-day are the same as they  were two thousand years ago--bream and chub. These were taken in  olden times by both net and hook and line.    The fishermen whom Christ chose as His disciples--Peter. Andrew,  James, and John--were professional net fishermen, but hook and line  fishing was a favorite pastime of the well-to-do Egyptians as well as  the poor people who could not afford a net.    Weirs not unlike the modern article were used in the Holy Land in  Bible time, excepting on Lake Gennesaret, where the law of the land  forbade them.    The bream and the chub were eaten alike by rich and poor people.  Wayfarers roasted them over chip fires in the groves and on the lake  shores, housewives boiled and broiled them, and the wealthy man served  them at his banquets. \"Moses, the friend of God,\" writes Izaak Walton,  in his immortal _Compleat Angler_, quoting from Lev. xi., 9, Deut.,  xiv., 9, \"appointed fish to be the chief diet for the best  commonwealth that ever yet was. The mightiest feasts have been of  fish.\"    Our Saviour \"fed the people on fish when they were hungry.\" The  species is not alluded to in the Biblical paragraph, but no doubt the  fish feasts of the Lord were mostly of chub and bream. Jesus loved  fishermen and was in their society most of His time. No other class of  men were so well favored by Him. He inspired St. Peter, St. John, St.  Andrew, and St. James, poor fishermen, who drew their nets for the  people, and these four fishermen, declares Father Izaak, \"He never  reproved for their employment or calling, as he did scribes and money  changers.\"    The Lord's favorite places of labor and repose--the places He most  frequented--were near the fishes and fisherman. \"He began to teach by  the seaside. His pulpit was a fishing boat or the shore of a lake. He  was in the stern of the boat, asleep. He was always near the water to  cheer and comfort those who followed it.\" And Walton tells us that  \"when God intended to reveal high notions to His prophets He carried  them to the shore, that He might settle their mind in a quiet repose.\"    Bream and chub are not monster fishes--they do not average the great  weights of the tarpon and the tuna; they are of the small and  medium-size species; so, if the apostles were pleased with \"ye gods  and little fishes,\" we mortals of to-day should be satisfied with our  catch, be it ever so small.
