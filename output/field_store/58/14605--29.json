A sufficient  knowledge of it for use in the study of this book may be gained  by means of the following experiments, which should be performed  at the outset by each pupil.    2. Length.    Experiment 1.--Note the length of 10 cm. (centimeters) on a  metric ruler, as shown in Figure 1. Estimate by the eye alone  this distance on the cover of a book, and then verify the result.  Do the same on a t.t. (test-tube). Try this several times on  different objects till you can carry in mind a tolerably accurate  idea of 10 cm. About how many inches is it?    In the same way estimate the length of 1 cm, verifying each  result. How does this compare with the distance between two blue  lines of foolscap? Measure the diameter of the old nickel five-  cent piece.    Next, try in the same way 5 cm. Carry each result in mind, taking  such notes as may be necessary.    (Fig. 1)    3. Capacity.    Experiment 2.--Into a graduate, shown in Figure 2, holding 25 or  50 cc. (cubic centimeters) put 10 cc. of water; then pour this into  a t.t. Note, without marking, what proportion of the latter is  filled; pour out the water, and again put into the t.t. the same  quantity as nearly as can be estimated by the eye. Verify the  result by pouring the water back into the graduate. Repeat  several times until your estimate is quite accurate with a t.t.  of given size. If you wish, try it with other sizes. Now estimate  1 cc. of a liquid in a similar way. Do the same with 5 cc.    A cubic basin 10 cm on a side holds a liter. A liter contains  1,000 cc. If filled with water, it weighs, under standard  conditions, 1,000 grams. Verify by measurement.    4. Weight.    Experiment 3.--Put a small piece of paper on each pan of a pair  of scales. On one place a 10 g. (gram) weight. Balance this by  placing fine salt on the other pan. Note the quantity as nearly  as possible with the eye, then remove. Now put on the paper what  you think is 10 g. of salt. Verify by weighing. Repeat, as before,  several times. Weigh 1 g., and estimate as before. Can 1 g. of  salt be piled on a one-cent coin? Experiment with 5 g.    5. Resume--Lengths are measured in centimeters, liquids in cubic  centimeters, solids in grams. In cases where it is not convenient  to measure a liquid or weigh a solid, the estimates above will be  near enough for most experiments herein given. Different solids  of the same bulk of course differ in weight, but for one gram  what can be piled on a one-cent piece may be called a  sufficiently close estimate. The distance between two lines of  foolscap is very nearly a centimeter. A cubic centimeter is seen  in Figure 1. Temperatures are recorded in the centigrade scale.    CHAPTER II.    WHAT CHEMISTRY IS.    6. Divisibility of Matter.    Experiment 4.--Examine a few crystals of sugar, and crush them  with the fingers. Grind them as fine as convenient, and examine  with a lens. They are still capable of division. Put 3 g. of  sugar into a t.t., pour over it 5 cc. of water, shake well, boil  for a minute, holding the t.t. obliquely in the flame, using for  the purpose a pair of wooden nippers (Fig. 3). If the sugar does  not disappear, add more water. When cool, touch a drop of the  liquid to the tongue. Evidently the sugar remains, though in a  state too finely divided to be seen. This is called a solution,  the sugar is said to be soluble in water, and water to be a  solvent of sugar.    (Fig 3.)    Now fold a filter paper, as in Figure 4, arrange it in a funnel  (Fig. 5), and pour the solution upon it, catching what passes  through, which is called the filtrate, in another t.t. that rests  in a receiver (Fig. 5). After filtering, notice whether any  residue is left on the filter paper. Taste a drop of the  filtrate. Has sugar gone through the filter? If so, what do you  infer of substances in solution passing through a filter? Save  half the filtrate for Experiment 5, and dilute the other half  with two or three times its own volume of water. Shake well, and  taste.    (Fig 4.)    (Fig 5.) We might have diluted the sugar solution many times  more, and still the sweet taste would have remained. Thus the  small quantity of sugar would be distributed through the whole  mass, and be very finely divided.    By other experiments a much finer subdivision can be made. A  solution of.00000002 g. of the red coloring matter, fuchsine, in  1 cc. of alcohol gives a distinct color.    Such experiments would seem to indicate that there is no limit to  the divisibility of matter. But considerations which we cannot  discuss here lead to the belief that such a limit does exist;  that there are particles of sugar, and of all substances, which  are incapable of further division without entirely changing the  nature of the substance. To these smallest particles the name  molecules is given.    A mass is any portion of a substance larger than a molecule; it  is an aggregation of molecules.    A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist  alone.    A substance in solution may be in a more finely divided state  than otherwise, but it is not necessarily in its ultimate state  of division.    7. A Chemical Change.--Cannot this smallest particle of sugar,  the molecule, be separated into still smaller particles of  something else? May it not be a compound body, and will not some  force separate it into two or more substances? The next  experiment will answer the question.    Experiment 5.--Take the sugar solution saved from Experiment 4,  and add slowly 4 cc.of strong sulphuric acid. Note any change of  color, also the heat of the t.t. Add more acid if needed.    A substance entirely different in color and properties has been  formed. Now either the sugar, the acid, or the water has  undergone a chemical change. It is, in fact, the sugar. But the  molecule is the smallest particle of sugar possible."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],[0,"Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#2)"],[1,"our ancestors walked in the clear daylight of unquestioning  certainty.    The original impulse out of which the classical tradition developed was  the naive faith of the Greek philosophers in the omnipotence of  reasoning. The discovery of geometry had intoxicated them, and its _a  priori_ deductive method appeared capable of universal application. They  would prove, for instance, that all reality is one, that there is no  such thing as change, that the world of sense is a world of mere  illusion; and the strangeness of their results gave them no qualms  because they believed in the correctness of their reasoning. Thus it  came to be thought that by mere thinking the most surprising and  important truths concerning the whole of reality could be established  with a certainty which no contrary observations could shake. As the  vital impulse of the early philosophers died away, its place was taken  by authority and tradition, reinforced, in the Middle Ages and almost to  our own day, by systematic theology. Modern philosophy, from Descartes  onwards, though not bound by authority like that of the Middle Ages,  still accepted more or less uncritically the Aristotelian logic.  Moreover, it still believed, except in Great Britain, that _a priori_  reasoning could reveal otherwise undiscoverable secrets about the  universe, and could prove reality to be quite different from what, to  direct observation, it appears to be. It is this belief, rather than any  particular tenets resulting from it, that I regard as the distinguishing  characteristic of the classical tradition, and as hitherto the main  obstacle to a scientific attitude in philosophy.    The nature of the philosophy embodied in the classical tradition may be  made clearer by taking a particular exponent as an illustration. For  this purpose, let us consider for a moment the doctrines of Mr Bradley,  who is probably the most distinguished living representative of this  school. Mr Bradley's _Appearance and Reality_ is a book consisting of  two parts, the first called _Appearance_, the second _Reality_. The  first part examines and condemns almost all that makes up our everyday  world: things and qualities, relations, space and time, change,  causation, activity, the self. All these, though in some sense facts  which qualify reality, are not real as they appear. What is real is one  single, indivisible, timeless whole, called the Absolute, which is in  some sense spiritual, but does not consist of souls, or of thought and  will as we know them. And all this is established by abstract logical  reasoning professing to find self-contradictions in the categories  condemned as mere appearance, and to leave no tenable alternative to the  kind of Absolute which is finally affirmed to be real.    One brief example may suffice to illustrate Mr Bradley's method. The  world appears to be full of many things with various relations to each  other--right and left, before and after, father and son, and so on. But  relations, according to Mr Bradley, are found on examination to be  self-contradictory and therefore impossible. He first argues that, if  there are relations, there must be qualities between which they hold.  This part of his argument need not detain us. He then proceeds:    \"But how the relation can stand to the qualities is, on the other side,  unintelligible. If it is nothing to the qualities, then they are not  related at all; and, if so, as we saw, they have ceased to be qualities,  and their relation is a nonentity. But if it is to be something to them,  then clearly we shall require a _new_ connecting relation. For the  relation hardly can be the mere adjective of one or both of its terms;  or, at least, as such it seems indefensible. And, being something  itself, if it does not itself bear a relation to the terms, in what  intelligible way will it succeed in being anything to them? But here  again we are hurried off into the eddy of a hopeless process, since we  are forced to go on finding new relations without end. The links are  united by a link, and this bond of union is a link which also has two  ends; and these require each a fresh link to connect them with the old.  The problem is to find how the relation can stand to its qualities, and  this problem is insoluble.\"[4]      [4] _Appearance and Reality_, pp. 32-33.    I do not propose to examine this argument in detail, or to show the  exact points where, in my opinion, it is fallacious. I have quoted it  only as an example of method. Most people will admit, I think, that it  is calculated to produce bewilderment rather than conviction, because  there is more likelihood of error in a very subtle, abstract, and  difficult argument than in so patent a fact as the interrelatedness of  the things in the world. To the early Greeks, to whom geometry was  practically the only known science, it was possible to follow reasoning  with assent even when it led to the strangest conclusions. But to us,  with our methods of experiment and observation, our knowledge of the  long history of _a priori_ errors refuted by empirical science, it has  become natural to suspect a fallacy in any deduction of which the  conclusion appears to contradict patent facts. It is easy to carry such  suspicion too far, and it is very desirable, if possible, actually to  discover the exact nature of the error when it exists. But there is no  doubt that what we may call the empirical outlook has become part of  most educated people's habit of mind; and it is this, rather than any  definite argument, that has diminished the hold of the classical  tradition upon students of philosophy and the instructed public  generally.    The function of logic in philosophy, as I shall try to show at a later  stage, is all-important; but I do not think its function is that which  it has in the classical tradition. In that tradition, logic becomes  constructive through negation. Where a number of alternatives seem, at  first sight, to be equally possible, logic is made to condemn all of  them except one, and that one is then pronounced to be realised in the  actual world. Thus the world is constructed by means of logic, with  little or no appeal to concrete experience. The true function of logic  is, in my opinion, exactly the opposite of this. As applied to matters  of experience, it is analytic rather than constructive; taken _a  priori_, it shows the possibility of hitherto unsuspected alternatives  more often than the impossibility of alternatives which seemed _prima  facie_ possible. Thus, while it liberates imagination as to what the  world _may_ be, it refuses to legislate as to what the world _is_. This  change, which has been brought about by an internal revolution in logic,  has swept away the ambitious constructions of traditional metaphysics,  even for those whose faith in logic is greatest; while to the many who  regard logic as a chimera the paradoxical systems to which it has given  rise do not seem worthy even of refutation. Thus on all sides these  systems have ceased to attract, and even the philosophical world tends  more and more to pass them by.    One or two of the favourite doctrines of the school we are considering  may be mentioned to illustrate the nature of its claims. The universe,  it tells us, is an \"organic unity,\" like an animal or a perfect work of  art. By this it means, roughly speaking, that all the different parts  fit together and co-operate, and are what they are because of their  place in the whole. This belief is sometimes advanced dogmatically,  while at other times it is defended by certain logical arguments. If it  is true, every part of the universe is a microcosm, a miniature  reflection of the whole. If we knew ourselves thoroughly, according to  this doctrine, we should know everything. Common sense would naturally  object that there are people--say in China--with whom our relations are  so indirect and trivial that we cannot infer anything important as to  them from any fact about ourselves. If there are living beings in Mars  or in more distant parts of the universe, the same argument becomes even  stronger. But further, perhaps the whole contents of the space and time  in which we live form only one of many universes, each seeming to itself  complete. And thus the conception of the necessary unity of all that is  resolves itself into the poverty of imagination, and a freer logic  emancipates us from the strait-waistcoated benevolent institution which  idealism palms off as the totality of being.    Another very important doctrine held by most, though not all, of the  school we are examining is the doctrine that all reality is what is  called \"mental\" or \"spiritual,\" or that, at any rate, all reality is  dependent for its existence upon what is mental. This view is often  particularised into the form which states that the relation of knower  and known is fundamental, and that nothing can exist unless it either  knows or is known. Here again the same legislative function is ascribed  to _a priori_ argumentation: it is thought that there are contradictions  in an unknown reality. Again, if I am not mistaken, the argument is  fallacious, and a better logic will show that no limits can be set to  the extent and nature of the unknown. And when I speak of the unknown, I  do not mean merely what we personally do not know, but what is not known  to any mind. Here as elsewhere, while the older logic shut out  possibilities and imprisoned imagination within the walls of the  familiar, the newer logic shows rather what may happen, and refuses to  decide as to what _must_ happen.    The classical tradition in philosophy is the last surviving child of two  very diverse parents: the Greek belief in reason, and the mediaeval  belief in the tidiness of the universe. To the schoolmen, who lived amid  wars, massacres, and pestilences, nothing appeared so delightful as  safety and order. In their idealising dreams,"]]]
