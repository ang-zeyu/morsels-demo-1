[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34101"],[0,"A Bilateral Division of the Parietal Bone in a Chimpanzee; with a Special (#2)"],[1," sagittal suture. This last portion of the  abnormal suture is considerably obliterated, and on and beyond the  temporal ridge is scarcely traceable. The point at which the division  has reached the sagittal suture is situated a little behind the middle  of the latter. The abnormal as well as the open part of the coronal  suture on this side shows a simpler serration than the corresponding  sutures on the left side.    In this specimen there is on neither side any encroachment of the  lower portion of the parietal bone upon the frontal, such as Ranke  lays stress on in the case of his orangs. A second skull of an  adolescent male chimpanzee, in the Museum of Natural History, has a  decided bend in the coronal suture, not unlike that which Ranke  describes, and which, as he thinks, generally indicates an old  parietal division; but in this case the bend is situated between the  inferior and superior boundaries of the prominent temporal ridge, and  apparently owes its origin to the latter (Figs. 2, 3, 4).    The main interest in the case just described centres in the direction  of the abnormal sutures, and in the clearness with which the two  divisions appear as equivalent and of the same origin, although one  divides the parietal completely, while the other is restricted to one  of its angles.    As to the course of the abnormal suture in the parietal bone, in all  the cases thus far reported, the division runs in a horizontal  direction (cases of Tarin, Soemmering, Gruber, Hyrtl, Welcker, Turner,  Putnam, Dorsey, Ranke, and others); or it runs obliquely from or near  the middle of the lambdoid suture to some part of the temporo-parietal  suture, the sphenoidal angle, or the lower portion of the coronal  suture (cases of Curnow, Ekmark, Gruber, Hyrtl, Lucae, Welcker,  Putnam, Traquair, Ranke); in a case of _Simia silenus_ described by  Gruber and in an Egyptian cranium described by Smith, the divisions  run to the lambda and begin respectively slightly above the pterion  and at it. In Boyd's and in two of Hyrtl's cases, the abnormal suture  begins at or below the bregma on the coronal margin of the parietal  bone, and ends at or near its mastoid angle; finally, in Blumenbach's  (cited by Welcker), Bianchi's, Fusari's, and Coraini's cases (those of  Coraini include two monkeys) the division is vertical, passing between  the temporo-parietal and sagittal sutures. The left division in our  chimpanzee approaches those in Gruber's _Simia silenus_ and Smith's  cases; but it originates much higher anteriorly, and terminates  slightly below the lambda on the occipital border of the parietal. The  division in the right parietal of the chimpanzee, beginning slightly  below the middle of the anterior border of the bone, and ending  slightly back of the middle of its sagittal border, has no analogy  among the cases previously described.    The difference in extent and terminations of the two abnormal sutures  in the chimpanzee is of particular interest in connection with the  problem of the significance and origin of those divisions of the  parietal bone that involve more or less only one of its angles.    Since the observations of Toldt,[4] and more recently of Ranke,[5] on  the development of the parietal bone in the human embryo, it appears,  though it cannot as yet be said whether the fact is or is not general,  that the bone originates from two centres of ossification. These  centres appear in most cases one directly above the other, but, as  Ranke himself shows,[6] and as can hardly be otherwise, these  primitive components of the parietal do not always show the same  relations in size or position. The centres blend together, ordinarily,  at the end of the third or during the first half of the fourth month  of f[oe]tal life. On this account, the typical, complete, horizontal  division of the human parietal bone, when met with at any time after  the fourth month of f[oe]tal life, is generally interpreted to-day as  a retardation of the union, or a persistence of separation, of the two  original segments of the bone. Opinion, however, is still unsettled as  to the significance of the more atypical, oblique divisions of the  parietal, particularly of those where the separation is limited to one  angle. Up to the recent contribution on the subject by Ranke, the  weight of opinion on the point, although rather briefly expressed,  seems to have been in favor of attributing to these smaller, oblique  divisions, the same significance as was given to the more typical,  horizontal ones. Gruber,[7] in reporting a new case of a bilateral  oblique suture in the parietal bone, calls the separated mastoid  angles \"the secondary posterior parietals.\" Hyrtl and Welcker advance  no definite theories on this point, though the latter expresses an  opinion[8] that in both the horizontal division and the separation of  the mastoid angle of the parietal bone the development of the  condition may be identical. In 1883 Prof. F. W. Putnam, in describing  one of his Tennessee skulls with an abnormal oblique suture in each  parietal,[9] referred the development of the separated mastoid angle  on the right side, as well as the larger oblique inferior portion of  the parietal on the left side, to a \"separate centre\" of ossification.  Ranke[10] opposes both Gruber's and Putnam's opinion, and presents  instead a theory somewhat vague and not satisfactorily demonstrated,  by which he accounts for the origin of oblique sutures from partial  horizontal sutures in the parietal bone through \"half-pathological  processes.\" In his words, \"the oblique parietal suture is allied to  the half-pathological conditions of the skull; it is wholly  unjustifiable to speak, as W. Gruber has done, of a separate Parietale  secundarium posterius, severed by the suture, as of a typical, in a  certain sense normal, formation. The oblique parietal suture is  nothing more than an incomplete (posterior), true, _i. e._, typical,  parietal suture with a sagittal course, modified by certain  half-pathological conditions.\" These half-pathological conditions are  produced, the author explains on the preceding page, \"durch  Einknickung der nach Herrn G. H. Meyer 'plastisch' aufwaerts gebogenen  hinteren Scheitelbeinraender.\"    This opinion of Ranke calls for a few words about the incomplete  horizontal parietal sutures. These sutures are apparently very rare in  human adults, only five instances being on record (4 Ranke's, 1  Turner's). They are more frequent in orangs (Ranke), and quite common  (as Ranke shows, and as I found independently before Ranke's publication  of his observations) in the human embryos near term and in new-born or  very young infants. In the human family, these partial divisions of the  parietal generally begin in the posterior part, and run sagittally to  the posterior border of the bone, ending in this border at or near its  middle. In orangs the incomplete horizontal divisions seem to begin, as  a rule, in the anterior part, and end at or near the middle of the  anterior border of the parietal. The length of these divisions varies  from a few millimetres to several centimetres, and they even reach up to  the centre of the parietal bone.[11] These divisions are, without doubt,  the remains of the original anterior and posterior clefts, or, if we go  a step further, of the original intervening antero-posterior space  between the original inferior and superior segments of the parietal.  From the very first contact of the growing centres, the median extremity  of these clefts is bounded both below and above by a mass of bone; and  when the anterior or posterior border of the parietal comes finally in  contact with the frontal or occipital bone, the anterior and posterior  sagittal clefts, if they still exist, lie between two well-developed,  firm portions of the bone. Under these circumstances it is quite  impossible to imagine any disturbance, mechanical or pathological, that  could affect solely or mainly the median portion of the cleft, and cause  a deflection downward in this portion of the division, or cause its  extension to the inferior border or even the anterior-inferior angle of  the parietal.    There are only two factors that can possibly affect and modify the  course of the incomplete parietal suture, and both of these would show  their influence mainly or entirely on the distal portion of the same.  These two factors are, first, an abnormal development, either  defective or excessive, of one of the original parietal segments; and,  secondly, influences that would interfere with the freedom of full  growth of the anterior or posterior border of the parietal.    In the first case, as can easily be imagined or even artificially  demonstrated, there would be possible only a lower or higher situation  or an obliquity affecting mostly the marginal portion of the division.  The results would be low or high sagittal sutures, and curved or  oblique sutures diverging from the parietal eminence,--effects  entirely different from the actually observed oblique sutures that  sever the lower portion of the parietal, or its mastoid angle.    Influences interfering with the free development of the anterior or  posterior border of the parietal bone could only deflect upwards or  downwards the marginal end of an incomplete parietal suture, or, at  most, in a case of a short suture, render it oblique or curved in its  entirety. No pathological condition, unless it were accompanied by a  fracture, could extend even a deflected antero-posterior incomplete  division to any of the borders of the bone.    There are, it seems to me, only three possible ways in which an  oblique suture, extending between any two borders of the parietal  bone, can be produced.    In the first case the oblique suture, or rather a suture-like  formation, may be the effect of an early fracture. A fracture produced  in adult life is generally recognizable as such; but a fracture dating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#2)"],[1,"  not be any better made. I have seen deadfalls so poorly made and  improperly set that they would make angels weep, neither were they  located where game was apt to travel. The deadfall if made right and  located where game frequents is quite successful.    Another thing, boys, think out every little plan before you attempt  it. If so and so sets his traps one way, see if you can't improve on  his plan and make it a little better. Do not rush blindly into any  new scheme, But look at it on all sides and make yourself well  acquainted with the merits and drawbacks of it. Make good use of your  brains, for the animal instinct is its only protection and it is only  by making good use of your reasoning powers that you can fool him.  Experience may cost money sometimes and loss of patience and temper,  but in my estimation it is the trapper's best capital.  An old  trapper who has a couple of traps and lots of experience will catch  more fur than the greenhorn with a complete outfit.  Knowledge is  power in trapping as in all other trades.    This is the old reliable \"pinch-head.\" The picture does not show the  cover, so I will describe it. Get some short pieces of board or short  poles and lay them on the stones in the back part of the pen and on  the raised stick in front.  Lay them close together so the animal  cannot crawl in at the top.  Then get some heavy stones and lay them  on the cover to weight down and throw some dead weeds and grass over  the pen and triggers and your trap is complete. When the animal tries  to enter and sets off the trap by pressing against the long trigger  in front, he brings the weighted pole down in the middle of his back,  which soon stops his earthly career.      [Illustration: THE PINCH HEAD.]    This deadfall can also be used at runways without bait. No pen or  bait is required. The game will be caught coming from either  direction. The trap is \"thrown\" by the trigger or pushing against it  when passing thru. During snowstorms the trap requires considerable  attention to keep in perfect working order, but at other times is  always in order when placed at runways where it is used without bait.    The trap can also be used at dens without bait with success. If used  with bait it should be placed a few feet from the den or near any  place frequented by the animal or animals you expect to catch.    Of course we all admit the steel trap is more convenient and  up-to-date, says a New Hampshire trapper. You can make your sets  faster and can change the steel trap from place to place; of course,  the deadfall you cannot. But all this does not signify the deadfall  is no good; they are good and when mink trapping the deadfall is  good. To the trapper who traps in the same locality every year, when  his deadfalls are once built it is only a few minutes' work to put  them in shape, then he has got a trap for the season.    I enclose a diagram of a deadfall (called here Log Trap) which, when  properly made and baited, there is no such a mink catcher in the trap  line yet been devised. This trap requires about an hour to make and  for tools a camp hatchet and a good strong jackknife, also a piece of  strong string, which all trappers carry.    This trap should be about fifteen inches wide with a pen built with  sticks or pieces of boards driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The  jaws of this trap consist of two pieces of board three inches wide  and about three and a half feet long, resting edgeways one on the  other, held firmly by four posts driven in the ground. The top board  or drop should move easily up and down before weights are put on. The  treddle should be set three inches inside level with the top of  bottom board. This is a round stick about three-fourths inch thru,  resting against two pegs driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The  lever should be the same in size. Now put your stout string around  top board.  Then set, pass lever thru the string over the cross piece  and latch it in front of the treddle.  Then put on weights and adjust  to spring, heavy or light as desired.  This trap should be set around  old dams or log jams by the brook, baited with fish, muskrat, rabbit  or chicken.      [Illustration: BOARD OR POLE TRAP.]    I herewith enclose a drawing of a deadfall that I use for everything  up to bear, writes a Rocky Mountain trapper, I hate to acknowledge  that I have used it to get \"lope\" meat with, because I sometimes  believe in firing as few shots as I can in some parts of the  Mountains.      [Illustration: BAIT SET DEADFALL.]    Drawing  No. 1 shows it used for bait; a snare can be used on it at  the same time by putting the drop or weight where it isn't liable to  fall on the animal. Put the weight on the other side of tree or make  it fall with the animal to one side. In this case a pole must be  strictly used. A good sized rock is all right for small animals. The  closer spikes 1 and 2 are together and the longer the tugger end on  bottom, the easier it will pull off.    Fig. 1.--Spike driven in tree one-half inch deeper than spike No. 2  (Fig. No. 2) to allow for notch.    3--Bait on end of trigger.    4--Heavy rock or log.    5--Wire, fine soft steel.    6--Trigger with notch cut in it.    7--Notch cut in trigger Fig G. Spike No. 2 must have head cut off and  pounded flat on end.    In setting it across a trail a peg must be driven in the ground. In  this peg the spikes are driven instead of tree as in drawing No. 1.  The end of brush stick in between peg and trigger end and when an  animal comes either way it will knock the brush and it knocks out the  trigger. Good, soft steel wire should be used In setting this  deadfall along river bank a stout stick can be driven in bank and  hang out over water. This stick will take the place of a limb on  tree. One end of a pole held in a slanting position by weighing one  end down with a rock will do the same as limb on tree. If a tree is  handy and no limb, lean a stout pole up against the tree and cut  notches in it for wire to work on.      [Illustration: TRAIL SET DEADFALL.]    1--Trail.    2--Log.    3--Trigger same as for bait on top deadfall drawing.    4--Stake driven in ground with spikes driven in it same as above in  tree.    5--Spikes same as above.    6--Wire.    7--Tree.    8--Brush put in trail with one end between trigger and peg to knock  off trigger when touched.    This deadfall has never failed me and when trapping in parts of the  country where lynx, coyote or wolverine are liable to eat marten in  traps, use a snare and it will hang 'em high and out of reach. Snare  to be fastened to trigger.    Of course a little pen has to be built when setting this deadfall  with bait. In setting in trail it beats any deadfall I have ever used  for such animals as have a nature to follow a trail. A fine wire can  also be tied to the trigger and stretched across trail instead of a  brush and tied on the opposite side of trail. I like it, as the  weight can be put high enough from the ground to kill an elk when it  drops.        CHAPTER II.    BEAR AND COON DEADFALL.    I will explain how to make the best bear deadfall, also the best one  for coon that ever was made, writes an old and successful deadfall  trapper. First get a pole six or eight feet long for bed piece, get  another sixteen or eighteen feet long and lay it on top of bed piece.  Now drive two stakes, one on each side of bed piece and pole and near  one end of bed piece. About 18 or 20 inches from first two stakes  drive two more stakes, one on each side of bed piece and fall pole.  Now drive two more stakes directly in front of your two back stakes  and about two inches in front.    Next cut a stick long enough to come just to the outside of last two  stakes driven. Then whittle the ends off square so it will work easy  between the treadle stakes and the two inside stakes that your fall  works in; next raise your fall pole about three feet high. Get a  stick about one inch thru, cut it so that it will be long enough to  rest against your treadle and that short stick is your treadle when  it is raised above the bed a piece, cut the end off slanting so it  will fit against the treadle good.      [Illustration: BEAR OR COON DEADFALL.]    Slant the other end so the fall pole will fit good. Now five or six  inches from the top of the slanted stick cut a notch in your slanted  stick. Go to the back side, lift your pole up, set the post on the  bed piece. Place the top of the slanted stick against the fall pole.  Then place the pole off post in the notch in slant stick. Press back  on bottom of slanted stick and place your treadle against the stick.  Your trap is set. Make V shape on inside of treadle by driving stakes  in the ground, cedar or pine, and hedge it in tight all around. If  such there is not, make it as tight as you can. Cover the top tight,  the cubby should be 3 feet long, 3 feet high and wide as your treadle  stakes.    Stake the bait near the back end of cubby. Be sure the treadle is  just above the bed piece. Take the pole off the cubby to set the trap  as you have set it from this side. You can set it heavy or light by  regulating the treadle. I sometimes drive spikes in the bed piece and  file them off sharp as it will hold better. You can weight the fall  poles as much as you like after it is set. Don't you see, boys, that  the old fellow comes along and to go in he surely will step on the  treadle. Bang, it was lowered and you have got him.    This is the best coon deadfall I ever saw. The fall pole for coon  should be about 14 inches high when set. Set it under trees or along  brooks where you can see coon signs. Bait with frogs, crabs or fish,  a piece of muskrat or duck for coon. Build it much the same as for  bear, only much smaller. You will find this a successful trap.      * * *    I will describe a deadfall for bear which I use, and which works the  best of any I have tried, says a Montana trapper. I have two small"]]]
