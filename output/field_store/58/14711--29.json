Among  others, it is found in the Arundel MS. 286, and the Harleian MSS.  674, 1022, and 2373. It has been published from the Harl. MS. 1022  by Professor C. Horstman, who observes that \"it is very old, and  certainly prior to Walter Hilton.\"[9] It is evidently by one of the  followers of Richard Rolle, dating from about the middle of the  fourteenth century. External and internal evidence seems to point to  its being the work of the anonymous author of the Divine Cloud of  Unknowing.    This is not the place to tell again the wonderful story of St.  Catherine of Siena (1347-1380), one of the noblest and most truly  heroic women that the world has ever seen. Her life and manifold  activities only touched England indirectly. The famous English  captain of mercenaries, Sir John Hawkwood, was among the men of the  world who, at least for a while, were won to nobler ideals by her  letters and exhortations. Two of her principal disciples, Giovanni  Tantucci and William Flete, both Augustinian hermits, were graduates  of Cambridge; the latter, an Englishman by birth, was appointed by  her on her deathbed to preside over the continuance of her work in  her native city, and a vision of his, concerning the legitimacy of  the claims of Urban the Sixth to the papal throne, was brought  forward as one of the arguments that induced England, on the  outbreak of the Great Schism in the Church (1378), to adhere to the  Roman obedience for which Catherine was battling to the death. A  letter which she herself addressed on the same subject to King  Richard the Second has not been preserved.    About 1493, Wynkyn de Worde printed The Lyf of saint Katherin of  Senis the blessid virgin, edited by Caxton; which is a free  translation, by an anonymous Dominican, with many omissions and the  addition of certain reflections, of the Legenda, the great Latin  biography of St. Catherine by her third confessor, Friar Raymond of  Capua, the famous master-general and reformer of the order of St.  Dominic (d. 1399). He followed this up, in 1519, by an English  rendering by Brother Dane James of the Saint's mystical treatise the  Dialogo: \"Here begynneth the Orcharde of Syon; in the whiche is  conteyned the reuelacyons of seynt Katheryne of Sene, with ghostly  fruytes and precyous plantes for the helthe of mannes soule.\"[10]  This was not translated from St. Catherine's own vernacular, but  from Friar Raymond's Latin version of the latter, first printed at  Brescia in 1496. From the first of these two works, the Lyf, are  selected the passages--the Divers Doctrines devout and  fruitful--which Pepwell here presents to us; but it seems probable  that he was not borrowing directly from Caxton, as an almost  verbally identical selection, with an identical title, is found in  the British Museum, MS. Reg. 17 D.V., where it follows the Divine  Cloud of Unknowing.    Margery Kempe is a much more mysterious personage. She has come down  to us only in a tiny quarto of eight pages printed by Wynkyn de  Worde:--    \"Here begynneth a shorte treatyse of contemplacyon taught by our  lorde Jhesu cryste, or taken out of the boke of Margerie kempe of  Lynn.\"    And at the end:--    \"Here endeth a shorte treatyse called Margerie kempe de Lynn.  Enprynted in Fletestrete by Wynkyn de worde.\"    The only known copy is preserved in the University of Cambridge. It  is undated, but appears to have been printed in 1501.[11] With a few  insignificant variations, it is the same as was printed twenty years  later by Pepwell, who merely inserts a few words like \"Our Lord  Jesus said unto her,\" or \"she said,\" and adds that she was a devout  ancress. Tanner, not very accurately, writes: \"This book contains  various discourses of Christ (as it is pretended) to certain holy  women; and, written in the style of modern Quietists and Quakers,  speaks of the inner love of God, of perfection, et cetera.\"[12] No  manuscript of the work is known to exist, and absolutely no traces  can be discovered of the \"Book of Margery Kempe,\" out of which it is  implied by the Printer that these beautiful thoughts and sayings are  taken.    There is nothing in the treatise itself to enable us to fix its  date. It is, perhaps, possible that the writer or recipient of these  revelations is the \"Margeria filia Johannis Kempe,\" who, between  1284 and 1298, gave up to the prior and convent of Christ Church,  Canterbury, all her rights in a piece of land with buildings and  appurtenances, \"which falls to me after the decease of my brother  John, and lies in the parish of Blessed Mary of Northgate outside  the walls of the city of Canterbury.\"[13] The revelations show that  she was (or had been) a woman of some wealth and social position,  who had abandoned the world to become an ancress, following the life  prescribed in that gem of early English devotional literature, the  Ancren Riwle.14 It is clearly only a fragment of her complete book  (whatever that may have been); but it is enough to show that she was  a worthy precursor of that other great woman mystic of East Anglia:  Juliana of Norwich. For Margery, as for Juliana, Love is the  interpretation of revelation, and the key to the universal  mystery:[15]--    \"Daughter, thou mayst no better please God, than to think  continually in His love.\"    \"If thou wear the habergeon or the hair, fasting bread and water,  and if thou saidest every day a thousand Pater Nosters, thou shalt  not please Me so well as thou dost when thou art in silence, and  suffrest Me to speak in thy soul.\"    \"Daughter, if thou knew how sweet thy love is to Me, thou wouldest  never do other thing but love Me with all thine heart.\"    \"In nothing that thou dost or sayest, daughter, thou mayst no better  please God than believe that He loveth thee. For, if it were  possible that I might weep with thee, I would weep with thee for the  compassion that I have of thee.\"    And, from the midst of her celestial contemplations, rises up the  simple, poignant cry of human suffering: \"Lord, for Thy great pain  have mercy on my little pain.\"    We are on surer ground with the treatise that follows, the Song of  Angels.[16] Walter Hilton--who died on March 24, 1396--holds a  position in the religious life and spiritual literature of England  in the latter part of the fourteenth century somewhat similar to  that occupied by Richard Rolle in its earlier years. Like the Hermit  of Hampole, he was the founder of a school, and the works of his  followers cannot always be distinguished with certainty from his  own. Like his great master in the mystical way, Richard of St.  Victor, Hilton was an Augustinian, the head of a house of canons at  Thurgarton, near Newark. His great work, the Scala Perfectionis, or  Ladder of Perfection, \"which expoundeth many notable doctrines in  Contemplation,\" was first printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1494, and is  still widely used for devotional reading. A shorter treatise, the  Epistle to a Devout Man in Temporal Estate, first printed by Pynson  in 1506, gives practical guidance to a religious layman of wealth  and social position, for the fulfilling of the duties of his state  without hindrance to his making profit in the spiritual life. These,  with the Song of Angels, are the only printed works that can be  assigned to him with certainty, though many others, undoubtedly from  his pen, are to be found in manuscripts, and a complete and critical  edition of Walter Hilton seems still in the far future.[17] The Song  of Angels has been twice printed since the edition of Pepwell.[18]  In profoundly mystical language, tinged with the philosophy of that  mysterious Neo-Platonist whom we call the pseudo-Dionysius, it tells  of the wonderful \"onehead,\" the union of the soul with God in  perfect charity:--    \"This onehead is verily made when the mights of the soul are  reformed by grace to the dignity and the state of the first  condition; that is, when the mind is firmly established, without  changing and wandering, in God and ghostly things, and when the  reason is cleared from all worldly and fleshly beholdings, and from  all bodily imaginations, figures, and fantasies of creatures, and is  illumined by grace to behold God and ghostly things, and when the  will and the affection is purified and cleansed from all fleshly,  kindly, and worldly love, and is inflamed with burning love of the  Holy Ghost.\"    But to this blessed condition none may attain perfectly here on  earth. The writer goes on to speak of the mystical consolations and  visitations granted to the loving soul in this life, distinguishing  the feelings and sensations that are mere delusions, from those that  truly proceed from the fire of love in the affection and the light  of knowing in the reason, and are a very anticipation of that  ineffable \"onehead\" in heaven.    The three remaining treatises--the Epistle of Prayer, the Epistle of  Discretion in Stirrings of the Soul, and the Treatise of Discerning  of Spirits[19]--are associated in the manuscripts with four other  works: the Divine Cloud of Unknowing, the Epistle of Privy Counsel,  a paraphrase of the Mystical Theology of Dionysius entitled Dionise  Hid Divinity, and the similar translation or paraphrase of the  Benjamin Minor of Richard of St. Victor already considered.[20]  These seven treatises are all apparently by the same hand. The  Divine Cloud of Unknowing has been credited "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#2)"],[1,"                                       418      CHAPTER V.

THE EXPLANATION OF CAESAR'S CONDUCT                              460          PREFACE.      Historic truth ought to be no less sacred than religion. If the precepts  of faith raise our soul above the interests of this world, the lessons  of history, in their turn, inspire us with the love of the beautiful and  the just, and the hatred of whatever presents an obstacle to the  progress of humanity. These lessons, to be profitable, require certain  conditions. It is necessary that the facts be produced with a rigorous  exactness, that the changes political or social be analysed  philosophically, that the exciting interest of the details of the lives  of public men should not divert attention from the political part they  played, or cause us to forget their providential mission.    Too often the writer represents the different phases of history as  spontaneous events, without seeking in preceding facts their true origin  and their natural deduction; like the painter who, in re-producing the  characteristics of Nature, only seizes their picturesque effect, without  being able, in his picture, to give their scientific demonstration. The  historian ought to be more than a painter; he ought, like the  geologist, who explains the phenomena of the globe, to unfold the  secret of the transformation of societies.    But, in writing history, by what means are we to arrive at truth? By  following the rules of logic. Let us first take for granted that a great  effect is always due to a great cause, never to a small one; in other  words, an accident, insignificant in appearance, never leads to  important results without a pre-existing cause, which has permitted this  slight accident to produce a great effect. The spark only lights up a  vast conflagration when it falls upon combustible matters previously  collected. Montesquieu thus confirms this idea: \"It is not fortune,\" he  says, \"which rules the world.... There are general causes, whether moral  or physical, which act in every monarchy, raising, maintaining, or  overthrowing it; all accidents are subject to these causes, and if the  fortune of a battle--that is to say, a particular cause--has ruined a  state, there was a general cause which made it necessary that that state  should perish through a single battle: in a word, the principal cause  drags with it all the particular accidents.\"[1]    If during nearly a thousand years the Romans always came triumphant out  of the severest trials and greatest perils, it is because there existed  a general cause which made them always superior to their enemies, and  which did not permit partial defeats and misfortunes to entail the fall  of the empire. If the Romans, after giving an example to the world of a  people constituting itself and growing great by liberty, seemed, after  Caesar, to throw themselves blindly into slavery, it is because there  existed a general reason which by fatality prevented the Republic from  returning to the purity of its ancient institutions; it is because the  new wants and interests of a society in labour required other means to  satisfy them. Just as logic demonstrates that the reason of important  events is imperious, in like manner we must recognise in the long  duration of an institution the proof of its goodness, and in the  incontestable influence of a man upon his age the proof of his genius.    The task, then, consists in seeking the vital element which constituted  the strength of the institution, as the predominant idea which caused  man to act. In following this rule, we shall avoid the errors of those  historians who gather facts transmitted by preceding ages, without  properly arranging them according to their philosophical importance;  thus glorifying that which merits blame, and leaving in the shade that  which calls for the light. It is not a minute analysis of the Roman  organisation which will enable us to understand the duration of so great  an empire, but the profound examination of the spirit of its  institutions; no more is it the detailed recital of the most trivial  actions of a superior man which will reveal the secret of his  ascendency, but the attentive investigation of the elevated motives of  his conduct.    When extraordinary facts attest an eminent genius, what is more contrary  to good sense than to ascribe to him all the passions and sentiments of  mediocrity? What more erroneous than not to recognise the pre-eminence  of those privileged beings who appear in history from time to time like  luminous beacons, dissipating the darkness of their epoch, and throwing  light into the future? To deny this pre-eminence would, indeed, be to  insult humanity, by believing it capable of submitting, long and  voluntarily, to a domination which did not rest on true greatness and  incontestable utility. Let us be logical, and we shall be just.    Too many historians find it easier to lower men of genius, than, with a  generous inspiration, to raise them to their due height, by penetrating  their vast designs. Thus, as regards Caesar, instead of showing us Rome,  torn to pieces by civil wars and corrupted by riches, trampling under  foot her ancient institutions, threatened by powerful peoples, such as  Gauls, Germans, and Parthians, incapable of sustaining herself without a  central power stronger, more stable, and more just; instead, I say, of  tracing this faithful picture, Caesar is represented, from an early age,  as already aspiring to the supreme power. If he opposes Sylla, if he  disagrees with Cicero, if he allies himself with Pompey, it is the  result of that far-sighted astuteness which divined everything with a  view to bring everything under subjection. If he throws himself into  Gaul, it is to acquire riches by pillage[2] or soldiers devoted to his  projects; if he crosses the sea to carry the Roman eagles into an  unknown country, but the conquest of which will strengthen that of  Gaul,[3] it is to seek there pearls which were believed to exist in the  seas of Great Britain.[4] If, after having vanquished the formidable  enemies of Italy on the other side of the Alps, he meditates an  expedition against the Parthians, to avenge the defeat of Crassus, it  is, as certain historians say, because activity was a part of his  nature, and that his health was better when he was campaigning.[5] If he  accepts from the Senate with thankfulness a crown of laurel, and wears  it with pride, it is to conceal his bald head. If, lastly, he is  assassinated by those whom he had loaded with benefits, it is because he  sought to make himself king; as though he were to his contemporaries, as  well as for posterity, the greatest of all kings. Since Suetonius and  Plutarch, such are the paltry interpretations which it has pleased  people to give to the noblest actions. But by what sign are we to  recognise a man's greatness? By the empire of his ideas, when his  principles and his system triumph in spite of his death or defeat. Is it  not, in fact, the peculiarity of genius to survive destruction, and to  extend its empire over future generations? Caesar disappeared, and his  influence predominates still more than during his life. Cicero, his  adversary, is compelled to exclaim: \"All the acts of Caesar, his  writings, his words, his promises, his thoughts, have more force since  his death, than if he were still alive.\"[6] For ages it was enough to  tell the world that such was the will of Caesar, for the world to obey  it.    The preceding remarks sufficiently explain the aim I have in view in  writing this history. This aim is to prove that, when Providence raises  up such men as Caesar, Charlemagne, and Napoleon, it is to trace out to  peoples the path they ought to follow; to stamp with the seal of their  genius a new era; and to accomplish in a few years the labour of many  centuries. Happy the peoples who comprehend and follow them! woe to  those who misunderstand and combat them! They do as the Jews did, they  crucify their Messiah; they are blind and culpable: blind, for they do  not see the impotence of their efforts to suspend the definitive triumph  of good; culpable, for they only retard progress, by impeding its  prompt and fruitful application.    In fact, neither the murder of Caesar, nor the captivity of St. Helena,  have been able to destroy irrevocably two popular causes overthrown by a  league which disguised itself under the mask of liberty. Brutus, by  slaying Caesar, plunged Rome into the horrors of civil war; he did not  prevent the reign of Augustus, but he rendered possible those of Nero  and Caligula. The ostracism of Napoleon by confederated Europe has been  no more successful in preventing the Empire from being resuscitated;  and, nevertheless, how far are we from the great questions solved, the  passions calmed, and the legitimate satisfactions given to peoples by  the first Empire!    Thus every day since 1815 has verified the prophecy of the captive of  St. Helena:    \"How many struggles, how much blood, how many years will it not require  to realise the good which I intended to do for mankind!\"[7]    _Palace of the Tuileries, March 20th, 1862._    NAPOLEON.
