The European Cock Robin--a bird as familiar to you as our own, no  doubt, because it was he who was killed by the Sparrow with the bow  and arrow, you well remember, and it was he who covered the poor Babes  in the Wood with leaves--is much smaller than our robin, even smaller  than a sparrow, and he is not a thrush at all. But this hero of the  story books has a red breast, and the English colonists, who settled  this country, named our big, cheerful, lusty bird neighbour a robin,  simply because his red breast reminded them of the wee little bird at  home that they had loved when they were children.    When our American robin comes out of the {6} turquoise blue egg that  his devoted mother has warmed into life, he usually finds three or  four baby brothers and sisters huddled within the grassy cradle. In  April, both parents worked hard to prepare this home for them. Having  brought coarse grasses, roots, and a few leaves or weed stalks for the  foundation, and pellets of mud in their bills for the inner walls  (which they cleverly managed to smooth into a bowl shape without a  mason's trowel), and fine grasses for the lining of the nest, they  saddled it on to the limb of an old apple tree. Robins prefer  low-branching orchard or shade trees near our homes to the tall,  straight shafts of the forest. Some have the courage to build among  the vines or under the shelter of our piazzas. I know a pair of robins  that reared a brood in a little clipped bay tree in a tub next to a  front door, where people passed in and out continually. Doubtless very  many birds would be glad of the shelter of our comfortable homes for  theirs if they could only trust us. Is it not a shame that they  cannot? Robins, especially, need a roof over their heads. When they  foolishly saddle their nest on to an exposed limb of a tree, the first  heavy rain is likely to soften the mud walls, and wash apart the  heavy, bulky structure, when      \"Down tumble babies and cradle and all.\"    {7}    It is wiser of them to fit the nest into the supporting crotch of a  tree, as many do, and wisest to choose the top of a piazza pillar,  where boys and girls and cats cannot climb to molest them, nor storms  dissolve their mud-walled nursery. There are far too many tragedies of  the nests after every heavy spring rain.    Suppose your appetite were so large that you were compelled to eat  more than your weight of food every day, and suppose you had three or  four brothers and sisters, just your own size, and just as ravenously  hungry. These are the conditions in every normal robin family, so you  can easily imagine how hard the father and mother birds must work to  keep their fledglings' crops filled. No wonder robins like to live  near our homes where the enriched land contains many fat grubs, and  the smooth lawns, that they run across so lightly, make hunting for  earth worms comparatively easy. It is estimated that about fourteen  feet of worms (if placed end to end) are drawn out of the ground daily  by a pair of robins with a nestful of babies to feed. When one of the  parents alights near its home, every child must have seen the little  heads, with wide-stretched, yellow bills, pop up suddenly like  Jacks-in-the-box. How rudely the greedy babies push and jostle one  another to get the most dinner, and how noisily they clamour for it!  Earth worms are the staff of {8} life to them just as bread is to  children, but robins destroy vast quantities of other worms and  insects more injurious to the farmers' crops, so that the strawberries  and cherries they take in June should not be grudged them.

These publications do not  contain the number of leagues between one place and another which  are given in the Spanish translation.    That the Portuguese manuscript printed at Lisbon in 1812 belongs to  Barbosa, stands only on the authority of Ramusio, who gives an  introduction by Odoardo Barbosa of the city of Lisbon, which is not  to be found either in the Barcelona MS. or in the Portuguese MS.,  and which has been translated from the Italian of Ramusio and  published in the Lisbon edition. The introduction to the Lisbon  edition states that the Portuguese MS. is not an autograph MS., and  that the account of Barbosa is bound up along with other papers.  This introduction refers to the passages in the Portuguese MS. which  are not to be found in Ramusio, and says it may be doubted whether  these were additions posterior to the work of Duarte Barbosa.    It had occurred to me that this work might be attributed to the  famous navigator Magellan, and that it must have been through him  that it found its way to Charles the Fifth's court: there are  several reasons for this supposition, and some difficulties in the  way of it; I will, however, follow Sr. Larranaga's advice, and state  both sides of the question.    Duarte Barbosa, cousin of Magellan, Alvaro de Mezquita, Estevan  Gomez, Juan Rodrigues de Carvalho were Portuguese employed by Spain  along with Magellan[2] in the fleet which sailed on the 21st  September 1519, from San Lucar de Barrameda to Brazil and the  straits which bear the name of that Admiral.    Now the _Panorama_ or Spanish version of the _Univers Pittoresque_  states (page 140):        \"It was at that time, although it has not been possible to      ascertain exactly the year, when the illustrious Viceroy of the      Indies sent Francisco Serrano to the Moluccas, a friend, and      also, as it is believed, a relation of Magellan, the same person      who by reason of the exact and precise data which he furnished      to the celebrated navigator deserved later to see his name      inscribed amongst those of other notable persons, whose fame      will last as long as history endures.\"           *       *       *       *       *        \"At the beginning of the same century Duarte Barbosa also      proceeded to the Moluccas, and cruised among those countries for      the space of sixteen years, collecting interesting notes, which      although they were not published till three centuries after the      event, are not on that account the less admirable and precious;      these reports were published in Lisbon in a work which bears the      following title: _Colleccao de noticias para a historia e      geografia das nacoes ultramarinas_; those reports which relate      to Barbosa are contained in the second volume.\"    Now this Barcelona MS. contains in an appendix the voyage of three  Portuguese, a Spaniard, and five Malays, whose captain was Francisco  Serrano, to the Moluccas in the year 1512: this supplies the date of  his voyage which the above quoted paragraph says could not be  ascertained, and this account is not in Ramusio's collection, and  there is every reason to suppose that it was as yet unpublished.    In addition to what has been said by the writers of the _Panorama_  and _Univers Pittoresque_, in which statement they follow the 3rd  Decade of the \"Asia\" of Barros, lib. v. cap. 8:--        \"We wrote before how Francisco Serrao wrote some letters from      the Maluco Islands where he was, to Fernao de Magalhaes, on      account of being his friend from the time when both were in      India, principally at the taking of Malaca:\"    it was to be expected that Barbosa and Serrano would furnish their  information to Magellan, whether as the head of their family, or as  the Portuguese who had been longest at the Spanish Court, and  through whom they might hope for advancement and further employment,  such as Duarte Barbosa obtained with the fleet which discovered the  Straits of Magellan.    Magellan returned to Europe in 1512. Duarte Barbosa probably did not  return till 1517, since he is said to have remained sixteen years in  the Indian Ocean, and in that case he could not have returned before  1515--however, it is said in the introduction to the Lisbon edition  that he is the son of Diego Barbosa, named in the Decades as having  sailed in 1501 with the first fleet with Joao de Nova: the same  introduction also says that the time of his departure to and return  to India are unknown.    Ramusio's edition of Barbosa's narrative says the writing of it was  finished in 1516; it does not, however, mention any facts which  occurred later than the year 1514. There is reason to suspect that  Ramusio obtained his copy from the same source as the Barcelona  manuscript, because the name of the precious stone zircon is spelled  differently, giagonza, jagonza, and gegonza, and this difference of  orthography coincides in the same places in the Spanish manuscript  and in Ramusio. Ramusio gives an appendix containing the prices of  precious stones and of spices, but has not got the voyage to the  Moluccas of Francisco Serrano. The only reason I can conjecture for  this not having reached Ramusio is, that it was a confidential  paper, on account of the rivalry of Spain and Portugal with regard  to those islands; and it is stated in history that Serrano increased  the distances so as to enable Magellan to persuade the Spaniards  that the Moluccas were more to the eastward, and that they fell  within the demarcation of territories assigned by the Pope to  Castille. This account of Francisco Serrano's voyage, and of his  remaining behind married at Maluco, was either written by the  Spaniard who accompanied him, or was translated by some other person  than Diego Ribero and the Genoese ambassador Centurione, since all  the points of the compass which in the body of the work are  indicated by the names of winds, are here described by their names,  as este, sudoeste, etc. Tramontana, greco, maestro, siloque, are all  Spanish terms, but are less literate than the names of the points of  the compass, and seem to be owing to the Genoese translator, to whom  they would be familiar. It must be observed that the handwriting and  paper of the narrative and two appendices of the Barcelona MS. are  identical, and the leaves are numbered consecutively, so that there  is no reason for supposing that the whole papers were not  originally, as they now are, placed together.    Ramusio in various parts of the narrative leaves a blank with the  words, _Here several lines are wanting_; this may be owing to  passages having been struck out for political reasons. The  Portuguese edition has a short passage not in the Spanish MS., the  only apparent motive for its omission being that it was to the  glorification of the Portuguese.    Since so large a portion of the present volume is contained in the  Portuguese manuscript of Barbosa printed at Lisbon, it would be  natural to follow Ramusio in attributing the work to him: at the  same time it is not easy to understand how Barbosa, who was in the  Indian Ocean at the time, should have confounded the two naval  actions at Diu in 1508 and 1509, which he relates as one only,  although the Portuguese were beaten in the first and victorious in  the second. It is also difficult to imagine that one person visited  all the places described in this volume, even in the space of  sixteen years, at a period when travelling was slower than at  present: and the observations on the manners and customs show a more  intimate knowledge than what could be acquired by touching at a port  for a few days only.    This work is that of no ordinary capacity; it shews great power of  observation, and also the possession by the writer of great  opportunities for inquiry into the manners and habits of the  different countries described. It could hardly have been drawn up by  an ecclesiastic, there is too great an absence of condemnation of  idolatrous practices, and the deficiencies of St. Thomas's  Christians are too lightly spoken of. An ecclesiastic would not have  been so indifferent to their mode of communion and to the sale of  the sacraments, which caused many to remain unbaptized. The scanty  mention of Albuquerque and of Goa, and its being the sort of  political memorandum which a person in Magellan's position, seeking  service from Spain, and desirous of pushing the Spanish government  to eastern as well as western enterprise, would be likely to write;  the commercial details, which are not those of a merchant, but  rather of a soldier, for the prices given chiefly relate to  provisions, horses and elephants, things useful in war, whilst the  prices of jewels and spices, drawn up in a business-like manner, are  in an appendix and not referred to in the narrative,--all these  circumstances seem almost to justify the conclusion that this volume  was drawn up by Magellan, or under Magellan's guidance, for the  purpose of being laid before Charles V, at the time that Magellan  was seeking the command which he received a short time later.    This volume derives additional value from the numerous passages in  which it runs parallel to the _Lusiad_, so that the two confirm one  another, and this prose description serves as a commentary to  Camoens. Several passages descriptive of the customs of the nairs of  Malabar in this work present very forcibly the connection between  Plato and the Hindus.    The travels of Varthema, a former publication of the Hakluyt  Society, gave evidence of the good administration of India  especially in regard to justice in olden times; similar testimony  will be found in this volume.
