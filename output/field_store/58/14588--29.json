After his discharge he  worked on steamboats and followed different lines of work, being  employed for several years at Mr. M.L. Davis' saw mill, and is at  present living on the Davis place at Oak Grove, Ala., an old Southern  home, with quarters originally built for the employees of the mill and  still known as the \"quarters\", and like other ante-bellum homes they  have their private burying ground on the place.    Uncle Charlie was married four times, but now a widower. He had four  children, two boys who are dead, and two girls, one Carrie Johnson, a  widow, living in Kushla, Ala., and the other, Ella Aarons, a grass  widow, living in Mobile, Ala.    Uncle Charlie says he saw Jeff. Davis as an old man, after the war at  Mississippi City, Miss., and then his face lit up, and he said; \"Wait a  minute, Madam, I saw another president, let me think,--Yes, Madam I saw  President Grant. He came through Mobile from New Orleans, and my! there  was a big parade that day.\"    When asked about Abraham Lincoln, Uncle Charlie thought awhile, and  answered:    \"According to what was issued out in the Bible, there was a time for  slavery, people had to be punished for their sin, and then there was a  time for it not to be, and the Lord had opened a good view to Mr.  Lincoln, and he promoted a good idea.\"    When he was asked about Booker T. Washington he replied:    \"It was traversed out to him until the white folks took part with him  and helped him carry on.\"    Uncle Charlie thinks the present day folks are bad and wicked, and dont  realize anything like the old folks.    Charlie is a Baptist, became one when he sought the Lord and thinks all  people should be religious.          Anthony Abercrombie          *Interview with Anthony Abercrombie*      --_Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama_    _OLD JOE CAN KEEP HIS TWO BITS_    Uncle Ant'ny sat dozing in the early morning sunshine on his rickety  front porch. He is a thin little old man with patches of white wool here  and there on his bald head, and an expression of kindness and gentleness  on his wrinkled old face.    As I went cautiously up the steps, which appeared none too safe, his  cane which had been leaning against his chair, fell to the floor with a  clatter. He awoke with a start and began fumbling around for it with his  trembling and bony hands.    \"Uncle Ant'ny, you don't see so well, do you?\" I asked as I recovered  the stick for him. \"No ma'am, I sho' don't,\" he replied. \"I ain't seed  none outen one of my eyes in near 'bout sixty years, and de doctor say I  got a catalac on de yuther one; but I knows you is white folks. I always  is been puny, but I reckon I does purty well considerin' I is a hundred  years old.\"    \"How do you know you are that old?\" I inquired of him. Without  hesitation he answered, \"I knows I's dat old 'cause my mistis put it  down in de Bible. I was born on de fourth day and I was a full growed  man when de war come on in '61.    \"Yassum, my mind kinder comes and goes, but I can always 'member 'bout  slave'y time. Hits de things what happen in dese days dat's so easy for  me to disremember. I b'longed to Marster Jim Abercrombie. His plantation  was 'bout sixteen miles north of Marion in Bibb county. When his son,  young Jim, ma'ied, old Marse Jim give me to him and he fetched me to  Perry county.    \"No'm, old marster didn't go to war 'ca'se he was corrupted; he was deaf  in bofe ears and couldn't see good nuther. But he didn't care much 'bout  me 'caze I was puny like and warn't much 'count in de field.    \"My mistis, Miss Lou, was raisin' me up to be a carriage driver, an' she  was jes' as good to me as she could be. She useta dose me up wid castor  oil, jimson root, and dogwood tea when I'd be feelin' po'ly, and she'd  always take up for me when Marse Jim get in behind me 'bout somep'n. I  reckon though I was a purty worrisome nigger in dem days; always gettin'  in some kind of mischief.    \"O yassum, I useta go to meetin'. Us niggers didn't have no meetin'  house on de plantation, but Marse Jim 'lowed us to build a brush arbor.  Den two years atter de surrender I took consideration and j'ined up wid  de Lawd. Dat's how come I live so long. De Lawd done told me, 'Antn'y,  you got a hundred and twenty miles to trabel. Dat mean you gwine to live  a hundred and twenty years, if you stay on de straight an' narrow road.  But if you don't, you gotter go jes' de same as all de yuthers.'\"    \"Tell me something about your master's slaves and his overseers,\" I  asked of him.    \"Well,\" he said, \"Marse Jim had 'bout three hundred slaves, and he hed  one mighty bad overseer. But he got killed down on de bank of de creek  one night. Dey never did find out who killed him, but Marse Jim always  b'lieved de field han's done it. 'Fore dat us niggers useta go down to  de creek to wash ourselves, but atter de overseer got killed down dar,  us jes' leave off dat washin', 'cause some of 'em seed de overseer's  ha'nt down dar floatin' over de creek.    \"Dar was another ha'nt on de plantation, too. Marse Jim had some trouble  wid a big double-j'inted nigger named Joe. One day he turn on Marse Jim  wid a fence rail, and Marse Jim had to pull his gun an' kill him. Well,  dat happen in a skirt of woods what I get my lightwood what I use to  start a fire. One day I went to dem same woods to get some 'simmons.  Another nigger went wid me, and he clumb de tree to shake de 'simmons  down whilst I be pickin' 'em up. 'Fore long I heared another tree  shakin' every time us shake our tree, dat other tree shake too, and down  came de 'simmons from it. I say to myself, 'Dat's Joe, 'cause he likes  'simmons too.' Den I grab up my basket and holler to de boy in de tree,  'nigger turn loose and drap down from dar, and ketch up wid me if you  can. I's leavin' here right now, 'cause Old Joe is over dar gettin'  'simmons too.'    \"Den another time I was in de woods choppin' lightwood. It was 'bout  sundown, and every time my ax go 'whack' on de lightwood knot, I hear  another whack 'sides mine. I stops and lis'ens and don't hear nothin'.  Den I starts choppin' ag'in I hears de yuther whacks. By dat time my  houn' dog was crouchin' at my feets, wid de hair standin' up on his back  and I couldn't make him git up nor budge.    \"Dis time I didn' stop for nothin'. I jes' drap my ax right dar, an' me  and dat houn' dog tore out for home lickety split. When us got dar Marse  Jim was settin' on de porch, an' he say: 'Nigger, you been up to somep'n  you got no business. You is all outen breath. Who you runnin' from?' Den  I say: 'Marse Jim, somebody 'sides me is choppin' in yo' woods, an' I  can't see him. And Marse Jim, he say: 'Ah, dat ain't nobody but Ole Joe.  Did he owe you anythin'?' An' I say: 'Yassah, he owe me two-bits for  helpin' him shuck corn.' 'Well,' Marse Jim say, 'don't pay him no mind:  it jes' Old Joe come back to pay you.'    \"Anyhow, I didn' go back to dem woods no mo'. Old Joe can jes' have de  two-bits what he owe me, 'cause I don't want him follerin' 'roun' atter  me. When he do I can't keep my mind on my business.\"          Molly Ammond (Ammonds)          *Interview with Molly Ammond (Ammonds)*      --_Gertha Couric_    _JESUS HAS MY CHILLUN COUNTED_    I walked along a dusty road under the blazing sun. In the shade of a  willow tree a Negro man was seated with his legs drawn up and his arms  crossed upon his knees. His head rested face downward upon his arms, as  he had the aspect of one in deep slumber. Beside him munching on a few  straggly weeds, a cantankerous mule took little notice of his  surroundings.    \"Can you tell me where Aunt Molly Ammonds lives?\" I asked in a loud  voice. The Negro stirred slowly, finally raising his head, and  displaying three rabbit teeth, he accompanied his answer with a slight  gesture of his hand.    \"Yassuh, dar her house raght across de road; de house wid de climbin'  roses on hit.\"    \"Thank you,\" I said.    \"Yassuh,\" was the drawled response, and the Negro quickly resumed his  former posture.    Aunt Molly Ammonds is as gentle as a little child. Her voice is soft and  each phrase measured to the slow functionings of her aged mind.    [Illustration: _Molly Ammond (Ammonds), Eufaula, Alabama_]    \"Honey,\" she said, \"you ain't gwineter believe dis, but I is de mammy of  thirty chilluns. Jesus got 'em counted an' so is me. I was born in a log  cabin dat had a loft, an' it was on Marse Lee Cato's plantation five  miles wes' of Eufaula. My pappy's name was Tobe Cato an' my mammy's was  Sophia. I had one sister, Marthy, an' two brothers, Bong and Toge. My  pappy made all de furniture dat went in our house an' it were might'  good furniture too. Us useta cook on de fiahplace. Us would cook ash  cakes. Dey was made outen meal, water and a little pinch of lard; on  Sundays dey was made outen flour, buttermilk an' lard. Mammy would rake  all de ashes out de fiahplace, den kivver de cake wid de hot ashes an'  let it cool till it was done.    \"Yas Missy,\" she continued, \"I recollects dat I was 'bout twelve or  fo'teen when de s'render come, kaze a little atter dat I ma'ied Pastor  Ammonds. We walked ober to Georgetown an' it was de fus' time I eber had  shoes, and I got dem fum ole Massa. I remembers dat I ma'ied in a  striped calico dress.\"    \"Aunt Molly,\" I said, \"you're getting a little ahead of your story, tell  me something about your plantation life before the war.\"    \"Well, honey, Massa Lee's place was 'bout three miles long an' two miles  wide, and we raised cotton, cawn, 'taters and all sorts of vegetables.  We had a mean oberseer dat always wanted to whup us, but massa wouldn't  'llow no whuppin'. Sometimes de massa whould ride over de place on a  hoss, an' when he come up on de oberseer a-fussin' at a nigger, Massa  say, 'Don't talk rough to dat nigger when he doin' de bes' he can.'    \"My pappy had a little garden of his own back of his cabin, an' he  raised some chickens for us to eat, an' we had aigs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36022"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#2)"],[1,"'bout Jesus. I got a heap mo' in slavery  dan I does now; was sorry when Freedom got here. I 'specks I is nigh to  a hundred, but dat's so old. I jest calls myself any whars twixt  seventy-five and a hundred. I recollects slavery, though. Ma was  Charlotte Anderson and she lived in Union County wid de Tuckers, jest  across from de Richards Quarter.    \"Biggest sight I ever see'd was dat balloon when it come down on Pea  Ridge. De man in it everybody addressed as Professor (Prof. Lowe--1861).  He let uncle Jerry git in it. Mr. McKissick helped uncle Jerry up in it.  It was de first balloon ever come to Union county, and 'til dis day I  don't like no balloons.    \"Airplanes jest tickles, I cannot tell you how come, but dey jest does.  I went out dar (throwing her arm in the direction of the landing field)  and see'd 'em light. Dressed-up white folks hopped down out'n it from a  little do' dat a man wid leg'uns and a cap on opened. Thing gwine on wid  lots of burring and all like dat. When dem folks got out, some mo'  clam'ned in. Dat same man opened de do', shot (shut) it, and de plane  tuck off. White folks 'lowed dat it was gwine to 'lanta, Ga.    \"Right dar I 'low'd, when I goes up like dat, I sho ain't gwine up wid  no man--I'se gwine up wid Jesus.    \"Dat white woman [HW: Amelia Earhardt] went up and ain't nobody found  her yet and it been two months. Lawd, she looking fer de world's end.  God don't mean fer womens to do nothing like dat. Womens is stumbling  blocks at times.    \"I got a boy dat been through school. He stays off, but he treats me so  good and talks to me like white folks does; so I calls him, 'white  child'. I 'longs to de church club. He tries to larn me to talk proper  when I goes out to dem meetings, but I fergits how befo' I reaches de  meeting. Us named it de 'Mothers' Club'. 'White child' pays fer me to  'long dar, and when I is down wid spells, dey nurses me. 'White child'  pays fer my 'onsurance' so dat I does not have no worriment to aggravate  my soul.    \"White child birthed one Sunday morning jest a year atter de big  earthquake. It was also Christmas morning, kaise my child drapped a year  to de day atter dat earthquake and I feared dat he was not gwinter have  no sense. But My God, how he can read!    \"One night, Aug. 30th, our house started rocking. We thought a panther  was a-rocking it, kaise my old man had see'd one. He run out wid a gun  and went to de wood pile; den he hollered to me and said, 'Delia, come  out here, de whole world is shaking'. God sho showed his power dat  night. Ever since dat I been fixed wid God. It won't long atter dat, us  heard a noise in our other room. Old man went in dar and see'd a panther  climbing up fer our rations. He grabbed his gun from over de do' and  shot dat panther in de corner.    \"I used to think dat niggers was fools dat called me a nigger. I go and  tell Miss Nellie Tucker. She 'low, 'No, you ain't no nigger when other  niggers calls you one.' Marse William whistle like a partridge; den Miss  Nellie play her pianny. I dance and Marse send fer me a sugar and butter  biscuit. Marse git his banjo and he pick it fer me to sing 'Oh, Bob  white, is your wheat ripe? No, no, not quite.' Dat when I lived as a  little gal on Marse William's home tract, called Musgrove Tract.    VISION: \"Was traveling in a gold chariot to Heaven. De overseer had come  to bleed me, but I went up. Something say to look back and see whar you  been. I looked back and said, 'Lawd, take me whar no rent won't bother  me!' Lawd answer, 'Do not pray dat way. Pray fer Him to do His will'.  Den I axed de Lawd whar is I. He say, 'Did you look down on dem  chimneys?' Den I see'd dat I was in de chariot wid water all under me.  It looked like de sky.    \"To-day, I am so glad to walk about in Jesus' care. I wish people could  see my faith. I am a Christian.\"          Agnes James          *Interview with Mom Agnes James, 80 years old*      *Claussens, S.C.*      --_Annie Ruth Davis_    \"Yes'um, I used to live in slavery time, but de Lord above know, I sho  don' really recollect nothin much to tell you 'bout slavery time. I don'  know exactly how old I is. Think I 'bout 80 some odd. Think dat 'bout de  age Bubba Gregg say I is. I tell you, I was so chillunfied in slavery  time, I ain' had no time to study 'bout no age. I say, I was so  chillunfied. Yes'um, dat it. Dat somethin dat I ought to had ax my  grandmammy 'bout how old I is, so den I might could call it up to you  right sharp. Oh, I wishes now I had ax my grandmammy dat word fore she  die.    \"Us belong to Mr. Hector Cameron fore freedom come here. Right down dere  to Salem Church, dat whe' I was born. You hear talk of Miss Janie Little  over dere to Marion, ain' you? Dat who used to be my mittie in dem days.  Yes, mam, boss had pick me out to tend to Miss Janie. You see, he give  all his daughters one of us to have a care for dem.    \"My white folks, dey had a right smart of colored people dey own en far  as I can reckon, dey been spend mighty good treatment to dem all de  time. I know 'bout old Miss used to love to feed us, my mercy! White  folks would send for all us chillun to go up to de big house en get  somethin to eat twixt meals. Yes'um, dey had a colored people quarter  dat been settin way back up on de hill. Had to have a quarter 'cause dat  whe' us been stay all de time old Miss won' stuffin' somethin down we  mouth. I remember, dere used to was de most pretty flowers in de lane  gwine through dem woods from us house right up to old Massa's yard en my  Lord, honey, I did love to be de first one long dere on a mornin to see  could I find a blossom to fetch to old Miss. Look like old Miss would be  so please to see my granny marchin all we chillun up dat path 'cause  when we would go dere on a mornin, she would set right down on de steps  en talk wid us. Would set dere in listen to see could all us say dat  prayin blessin she had learned us to speak fore she would hand us  anything to eat. Den she would give us everyone a spoonful of dis here  worm cure. Great Jerusalem! Miss would make dat herself out dese black  lookin seed mixed up in molasses. I remember, she would bring a big bowl  of dat out dere en would make Pickle tote it round for her while she put  it in us mouth. Yes, mam, Miss would give us all a spoonful of dat every  mornin en den she would ax us de next mornin if any us had any worms.  No, mam, she never didn' give us any other kind of medicine as I can  remember. Just give us dat en den feed us some milk en bread. Dat all  she give us, but I tell you, I was as proud of dat milk en bread as I is  of de rations I get dese days 'cause I never know no different den.  No'um, didn' nobody eat den like dey do now. All de people would make  dey own gardens in dem days en would fix soup en fry meat. I used to  been so glad to get me a 'tatoe en a piece of bread. I thought I was  eatin cake.    \"I never didn' work in no field or nothin like dat no time. When I was a  little small girl, I would stay dere home en play 'bout de yard en nurse  my mammy's baby while she was workin in de field.

Don' know whe' she work all  day or no, but I know she would always let up at 12 o'clock en come to  de house to get her somethin to eat. Can remember dat good as anything.  Oh, she would have to cook herself when she come home bein' dere wasn'  none of we chillun big enough to cook nothin. I recollects, I used to  get chips en pile dem up for her 'cause she always been tell me, if de  baby go to sleep, to get up some chips en put dem on de steps for her to  hurry en start fire wid. She would cook us meat en bread like corn  hoecake en fry meat de most of de time. Den another time, she would bake  a big round loaf like dat en break it in two en give me half en my  brother Charlie de other part. Would lay a piece of meat on de top of  it. No'um, I reckon 'bout all de people used to cook in de chimney. I  know my mammy used to cook in de chimney en I don' think she thought  nothin 'bout no stove in dem days. Cose if she did, I know we chillun  didn' get it.    \"Yes, Lord, I been married 'bout 16 years fore my husband died.
