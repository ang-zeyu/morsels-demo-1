Samuel Cutts knew, equally well,  that he was not a good maker of money, nor creator of pork and potatoes.  Six years of farming in the valley of the Merrimac had proved that to  him, if he had never learned it before. Samuel Cutts's dream had been,  when he went away to explore the Western Reserve, that he would like to  bring together some of the best line officers and some of the best  privates of the old \"Fighting Twenty-seventh,\" and take them, with his  old provident skill, which had served them so well upon so many  camping-grounds, to some region where they could stand by each other  again, as they had stood by each other before, and where sky and earth  would yield them more than sky and earth have yet yielded any man in  Eastern Massachusetts. Well! as I said, the Western Reserve did not seem  to be the place. After all, \"the Fighting Twenty-seventh\" were not  skilled in the tilling of the land. They furnished their quota when the  boats were to be drawn through the ice of the Delaware, to assist in  Rahl's Christmas party at Trenton. Many was the embarkation at the \"head  of Elk,\" in which the \"Fighting Twenty-seventh\" had provided half the  seamen for the transport. It was \"the Fighting Twenty-seventh\" who cut  out the \"Princess Charlotte\" cutter in Edisto Bay. But the \"Fighting  Twenty-seventh\" had never, so far as any one knew, beaten one sword  into one plough-share, nor one spear into one pruning-hook. But Tripp's  Cove seemed to offer a different prospect. Why not, with a dozen or two  of the old set, establish there, not the New Jerusalem, indeed, but  something a little more elastic, a little more helpful, a little more  alive, than these kiln-dried, sun-dried, and time-dried old towns of the  seaboard of Massachusetts? At any rate, they could live together in  Tripp's Cove, as they wintered together at Valley Forge, at Bennett's  Hollow, by the Green Licks, and in the Lykens Intervale. This was the  question which Samuel Cutts wanted to solve, and which the fatal figures  219-7 put him in the way of solving.    \"Tripp's Cove is our Christmas present,\" said Sybil Cutts to her  husband, as they went to bed. But so far removed were the habits of New  England then from the observance of ecclesiastical anniversaries, that  no one else had remembered that day that it was Christmas which was  passing.      CHAPTER II.    TRIPP'S COVE.    Call this a long preface, if you please, but it seems to me best to tell  this story so that I may explain what manner of people those were and  are who lived, live, and will live, at Tripp's Cove,--and why they have  been, are, and will be linked together, with a sort of family tie and  relationship which one does not often see in the villages self-formed or  formed at hap-hazard on the seaside, on the hillside, or in the prairies  of America. Tripp's Cove never became \"the Great Mercantile City of the  Future,\" nor do I believe it ever will. But there Samuel Cutts lived in  a happy life for fifty years,--and there he died, honored, blessed, and  loved. By and by there came the second war with England,--the \"Endymion\"  came cruising along upon the coast, and picking up the fishing-boats and  the coasters, burning the ships on the stocks, or compelling the owners  to ransom them. Old General Cutts was seventy years old then; but he  was, as he had always been, the head of the settlement at Tripp's,--and  there was no lack of men younger than he, the sergeants or the  high-privates of the \"Fighting Twenty-seventh,\" who drilled the boys of  the village for whatever service might impend. When the boys went down  to Runkin's and sent the \"Endymion's\" boats back to her with half their  crews dead or dying, faster than they came, old General Cutts was with  them, and took sight on his rifle as quickly and as bravely as the best  of them. And so twenty years more passed on,--and, when he was well nigh  ninety, the dear old man died full of years and full of blessings, all  because he had launched out for himself, left the life he was not fit  for, and undertaken life in which he was at home.    Yes! and because of this also, when 1861 came with its terrible alarm to  the whole country, and its call to duty, all Tripp's Cove was all right.  The girls were eager for service, and the boys were eager for service.  The girls stood by the boys, and the boys stood by the girls. The  husbands stood by the wives, and the wives stood by the husbands. I do  not mean that there was not many another community in which everybody  was steadfast and true. But I do mean that here was one great family,  although the census rated it as five-and-twenty families,--which had  one heart and one soul in the contest, and which went into it with one  heart and one soul,--every man and every woman of them all bearing each  other's burdens.    Little Sim Cutts, who broke the silence that night when the post-man  threw down the \"Boston Gazette,\" was an old man of eighty-five when they  all got the news of the shots at Fort Sumter. The old man was as hale  and hearty as are half the men of sixty in this land to-day. With all  his heart he encouraged the boys who volunteered in answer to the first  call for regiments from Maine. Then with full reliance on the traditions  of the \"Fighting Twenty-seventh,\" he explained to the fishermen and the  coasters that Uncle Abraham would need them for his web-footed service,  as well as for his legions on the land. And they found out their ways to  Portsmouth and to Charlestown, so that they might enter the navy as  their brothers entered the army. And so it was, that, when Christmas  came in 1861, there was at Tripp's Cove only one of that noble set of  young fellows, who but a year before was hauling hemlock and spruce and  fir and pine at Christmas at the girls' order, and worked in the  meeting-house for two days as the girls bade them work, so that when  Parson Spaulding came in to preach his Christmas sermon, he thought the  house was a bit of the woods themselves. Only one!    And who was he?    How did he dare stay among all those girls who were crying out their  eyes, and sewing their fingers to the bones,--meeting every afternoon in  one sitting-room or another, and devouring every word that came from the  army? They read the worst-spelled letter that came home from Mike Sawin,  and prized it and blessed it and cried over it, as heartily as the  noblest description of battle that came from the pen of Carleton or of  Swinton.    Who was he?    Ah! I have caught you, have I? That was Tom Cutts,--the old General's  great-grandson,--Sim Cutts's grandson,--the very noblest and bravest of  them all. He got off first of all. He had the luck to be at Bull  Run,--and to be cut off from his regiment. He had the luck to hide under  a corn crib, and to come into Washington whole, a week after the  regiment. He was the first man in Maine, they said, to enlist for the  three-years' service. Perhaps the same thing is said of many others. He  had come home and raised a new company,--and he was making them fast  into good soldiers, out beyond Fairfax Court-House. So that the  Brigadier would do any thing Tom Cutts wanted. And when, on the first of  December, there came up to the Major-General in command a request for  leave of absence from Tom Cutts, respectfully referred to Colonel This,  who had respectfully referred it to General That, who had respectfully  referred it to Adjutant-General T'other,--all these dignitaries had  respectfully recommended that the request be granted. For even in the  sacred purlieux of the top Major-General's Head-quarters, it was  understood that Cutts was going home for no less a purpose than the  being married to the prettiest and sweetest and best girl in Eastern  Maine.    Well! for my part I do not think that the aids and their informants were  in the wrong about this. Surely that Christmas Eve, as Laura Marvel  stood up with Tom Cutts in front of Parson Spaulding, in presence of  what there was left of the Tripp's Cove community, I would have said  that Laura was the loveliest bride I ever saw. She is tall; she is  graceful; she has rather a startled look when you speak to her,  suddenly or gently, but the startled look just bewitches you. Black  hair,--she got that from the Italian blood in her grandmother's  family,--exquisite blue eyes,--that is a charming combination with black  hair,--perfect teeth,--and matchless color,--and she had it all, when  she was married,--she was a blushing bride and not a fainting one. But  then what stuff this is,--nobody knew he cared a straw for Laura's hair  or her cheek,--it was that she looked \"just lovely,\" and that she was  \"just lovely,\"--so self-forgetful in all her ways, after that first  start,--so eager to know just where she could help, and so determined to  help just there. Why! she led all the girls in the village, when she was  only fourteen, because they loved her so. She was the one who made the  rafts when there was a freshet,--and took them all out together on the  mill-pond. And, when the war came, she was of course captain of the  girl's sewing,--she packed the cans of pickles and fruit for the  Sanitary,--she corresponded with the State Adjutant:--heavens! from  morning to night, everybody in the village ran to Laura,--not because  she was the prettiest creature you ever looked upon,--but because she  was the kindest, truest, most loyal, and most helpful creature that ever  lived,--be the same man or woman.    Now had you rather be named Laura Cutts or Laura Marvel? Marvel is a  good name,--a weird, miraculous sort of name. Cutts is not much of a  name. But Laura had made up her mind to be Laura Cutts after Tom had  asked her about it,--and here they are standing before dear old Parson  Spaulding, to receive his exhortation,--and to be made one before God  and man.    Dear Laura! How she had laughed with the other girls, all in a  good-n"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32472"],[0,"Food in War Time (#2)"],[1,"the practical results of their work  as follows:       But when we approach the subject of the dietary of the poorer     classes, the question is a more serious one. In ordinary times     the consumption of beef dripping, which is considerable among     the poor, would to a large extent supply the lacking     properties of a vegetable-oil margarine. But at the present     time beef itself is expensive, and the opportunities of     obtaining dripping are therefore minimized. At the same time     the three important foods for children already enumerated     (milk, butter, eggs) have risen in cost, so as to be almost     prohibitive to those with slender incomes. The vegetable-oil     margarines still remain comparatively cheap, and the danger is     that unless measures are taken to insure a proper milk supply     for infants at a reasonable charge, these infants may run the     risk of being fed, so far as fat is concerned, entirely upon     an inferior brand of margarine, destitute of the     growth-promoting accessory substance. It would be truer     economy even for the poor to purchase smaller quantities of an     oleo-oil margarine if they cannot afford the luxury of real     butter.    The legal restrictions placed upon the sale of oleomargarine and the  taxes enhancing its cost, now in operation in many of our states, are  without warrant in morals or common sense and should be entirely  abolished in times like these. A well-made brand of oleomargarine is  much more palatable than butter of the second grade, and certainly for  cooking purposes is just as valuable.    Whole milk contains everything necessary for growth and maintenance,  protein, fat, milk-sugar, salts, water, and the unknown but invaluable  accessory substances. It is of such prime importance that each family  should have this admirable food that I have suggested that no family of  five should ever buy meat until they have bought three quarts of milk.  The insistence by scientific men upon the prime importance of milk has  probably had something to do with its rapid enhancement in price. This  latter factor is greatly to be regretted. I have often wondered why it  was that a quart bottle of a fancy brand of milk in New York should cost  about as much as a quart of _vin ordinaire_ on the streets of Paris, and  a quart bottle of cream as much as a quart of good champagne in Paris.  Despite much denial it appears to me that milk is not sold as cheaply as  it ought to be. Everything should be done to conserve our herds of cows  for the increased supply of whole milk and incidentally for the  manufacture of cheese and of milk powder or of condensed milk.    If one takes milk with other foods, meat may be dispensed with. Thus  Hindhede advocates as ideal a diet consisting of bread, potatoes, fruit,  and a pint of milk. Splendid health, both of body and mind, the  peasants' comparative immunity to indigestion, kidney and liver disease,  as well as an absolute immunity to gout, is the alluring prospect held  out by the following dietary:      Graham bread       1 pound    Potatoes           2 pounds    Vegetable fat      1/2 pound    Apples             1-1/2 pounds    Milk               1 pint    This bread-potato-fruit diet gives a very excellent basis of wholesome  nutrition. The potatoes yield an alkaline ash which has a highly solvent  power over uric acid, and, therefore, a good supply of these valuable  tubers is needed by the nation.    To most Americans the dietary factors here described will appear to be  merely attenuated hypotheses, fit only for philosophic contemplation.  For, in real life, it is the roast beef of Old England, or some other  famed equivalent, that makes its appeal. Far be it from me to disparage  the feast following a hunt of the wild boar or other feasts famed in  song and story, but that is not the question. The question is, is meat  necessary? The description of the Italian dietary answers this in the  negative.    But is meat desirable? The Italian experimenters believed that the  addition of four or eight ounces of meat to the dietaries of some of  their subjects increased their physical and also their mental powers.  The increase in mental power due to change in diet has always seemed to  me to be a figment of the imagination and not susceptible of  demonstration. Thomas lived for twenty-four days on a diet of starch and  cream, during four days of which time the very small quantity of three  ounces of meat was taken daily, and he found his mental and muscular  power unchanged.    A remarkable experiment on the effect of a potato diet has been  reported by Hindhede. An individual partook of a diet of between four  and one-half and nine pounds of potatoes daily, with some vegetable  margarine, during a period of nearly three hundred days. The rule was to  eat only when hungry and then the potatoes could be taken at the rate of  an ounce a minute. During the last three months (ninety-five days) of  the experiment severe mechanical work was performed and the total food  intake for the latter period amounted to 770 pounds of potatoes and 48  pounds of margarine. What could be more simple than stocking the cellar  with coal, potatoes, and a tub of margarine! Who then would worry about  the complexities of modern life?    Of course, vegetarianism is no new thing. Its principal exponent was  Sylvester Graham. It so happens that he was the brother of my great  grandmother, and of him my father wrote in 1861, \"long lanky Sylvester  Vegetable Graham, leanest of men.\" Graham in 1829 began the advocacy of  moderation in the use of a diet consisting of vegetables, Graham bread,  fruits, nuts, salts and pure water, and excluding meat, sauces, salads,  tea, coffee, alcohol, pepper, and mustard. The first effect of this  diet, which largely eliminated the flavors, was to reduce the weight  through lowering the intake of food, but the health of many followers of  the diet appears to have been benefited. The \"Graham System\" of dieting  suffered from withering criticism at the time. He published in 1837 a  little book entitled, \"Bread and Bread Making,\" bearing on its cover the  scriptural quotation \"Bread strengtheneth man's heart.\" He says in this  volume:       But while the people of our country are entirely given up as     they are at present, to gross and promiscuous feeding on the     dead carcasses of animals and to the untiring pursuit of     wealth, it is perhaps wholly vain for a single individual to     raise his voice on a subject of this kind.    The well-known work of Chittenden has shown that when the protein  intake is reduced by one half or less of that which the average American  appetite suggests, professional men, soldiers and athletes may be  maintained in the best physical condition. One of Yale's champion  intercollegiate athletes won all the events of the year in which he was  entered while living on a reduced protein or Chittenden diet. Upon such  a diet, or less than that, the people of Germany are now living to-day.  The principle involves eating meat very sparingly, taking half a piece  where one would have formerly been taken, and using it only for its  flavor. The wing of a chicken has little meat on it and yet if eaten  together with vegetables it gives the meal a different quality than it  would have had without it, and to this extent its use is warranted. The  muscles are active when hard labor is done, but the muscles do not need  meat for the performance of their work. A fasting man may have  considerable power. The popular idea of the necessity of meat for a  laboring man may be epitomized in the statement: a strong man can eat  more meat than a weak one, hence meat makes a man strong. The  proposition is evidently absurd.    Not only is the taking of meat without beneficial relation to the  capacity for muscular work, but, in fact, an exclusive meat diet results  in the sensation that work is being accomplished with difficulty. When  meat is metabolized it stimulates the body to a higher heat production,  as great an increase as 55 per cent. having been observed in a resting  man. No other food-stuff will accomplish so great an increase. It is  especially worthy of note that this increase in the heat production, due  to the _specific dynamic action_ of protein, as it is called, cannot be  utilized in the execution of mechanical work. When the organism of a  laborer at work in a hot environment is called upon to eliminate extra  heat, due to the work he is performing, he must also eliminate the quota  of heat which is derived from any large ingestion of meat. Hence, the  American farmer in the hot weather can eat little meat.    So far as is known, taking meat even in large excess is not harmful, but  it represents luxury and waste. According to an oral statement by A. E.  Taylor, the results of many thousand urinary analyses in Germany during  the second year of the war showed about 7 grams of nitrogen excreted,  which would correspond to a dietary containing about 45 grams of  protein. As a matter of fact, this is the equivalent of the reduced  protein dietary of Chittenden, and it is reported that no ill effects  can be attributed to it. The flavor of meat is such that it lends itself  to the easy preparation of a palatable meal, but this flavor could  undoubtedly be as well obtained if the present consumption of meat were  cut in two. It is a question of habit, but with the present reduced  supply of meat one must adopt new habits. It would be highly desirable  if the grain now fed to fatten beef were given to maintain herds of  milch cows.    Indulgence in meat is due to the desire for strong flavor. With the  increased distribution of wealth, the demand for meat grows. Its  consumption by all classes had vastly increased in all prosperous  countries prior to the war. It is well, however, to remember that its  use has been excessive and unnecessary, and its price can be cut by"]]]
