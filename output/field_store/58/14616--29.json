The thunderbolts seemed to descend in clattering confusion upon  the roof. Sometimes there was a moment of dead silence, broken only by  the pattering of the rain in the street without, or the pattering of the  dice in a chamber at hand. Then horses were backed, bets made, and there  were loud and frequent calls for brimming goblets from hurrying waiters,  distracted by the lightning and deafened by the peal. It seemed a scene  and a supper where the marble guest of Juan might have been expected,  and had he arrived, he would have found probably hearts as bold and  spirits as reckless as he encountered in Andalusia.          Book 1 Chapter 2        \"Will any one do anything about Hybiscus?\" sang out a gentleman in the  ring at Epsom. It was full of eager groups; round the betting post a  swarming cluster, while the magic circle itself was surrounded by a  host of horsemen shouting from their saddles the odds they were ready to  receive or give, and the names of the horses they were prepared to back  or to oppose.    \"Will any one do anything about Hybiscus?\"    \"I'll give you five to one,\" said a tall, stiff Saxon peer, in a white  great coat.    \"No; I'll take six.\"    The tall, stiff peer in the white great coat mused for a moment with his  pencil at his lip, and then said, \"Well, I'll give you six. What do you  say about Mango?\"    \"Eleven to two against Mango,\" called out a little humpbacked man in a  shrill voice, but with the air of one who was master of his work.    \"I should like to do a little business with you, Mr Chippendale,\" said  Lord Milford in a coaxing tone, \"but I must have six to one.\"    \"Eleven to two, and no mistake,\" said this keeper of a second-rate  gaming-house, who, known by the flattering appellation of Hump  Chippendale, now turned with malignant abruptness from the heir apparent  of an English earldom.    \"You shall have six to one, my Lord,\" said Captain Spruce, a debonair  personage with a well-turned silk hat arranged a little aside, his  coloured cravat tied with precision, his whiskers trimmed like a  quickset hedge. Spruce, who had earned his title of Captain on the  plains of Newmarket, which had witnessed for many a year his successful  exploits, had a weakness for the aristocracy, who knowing his graceful  infirmity patronized him with condescending dexterity, acknowledged his  existence in Pall Mall as well as at Tattersalls, and thus occasionally  got a point more than the betting out of him. Hump Chippendale had none  of these gentle failings; he was a democratic leg, who loved to fleece a  noble, and thought all men were born equal--a consoling creed that was a  hedge for his hump.    \"Seven to four against the favourite; seven to two against Caravan;  eleven to two against Mango. What about Benedict? Will any one do  anything about Pocket Hercules? Thirty to one against Dardanelles.\"    \"Done.\"    \"Five and thirty ponies to one against Phosphorus,\" shouted a little man  vociferously and repeatedly.    \"I will give forty,\" said Lord Milford. No answer,--nothing done.    \"Forty to one!\" murmured Egremont who stood against Phosphorus. A little  nervous, he said to the peer in the white great coat, \"Don't you think  that Phosphorus may after all have some chance?\"    \"I should be cursed sorry to be deep against him,\" said the peer.    Egremont with a quivering lip walked away. He consulted his book; he  meditated anxiously. Should he hedge? It was scarcely worth while to mar  the symmetry of his winnings; he stood \"so well\" by all the favourites;  and for a horse at forty to one. No; he would trust his star, he would  not hedge.    \"Mr Chippendale,\" whispered the peer in the white great coat, \"go and  press Mr Egremont about Phosphorus. I should not be surprised if you got  a good thing.\"    At this moment, a huge, broad-faced, rosy-gilled fellow, with one of  those good-humoured yet cunning countenances that we meet occasionally  on the northern side of the Trent, rode up to the ring on a square cob  and dismounting entered the circle. He was a carcase butcher, famous in  Carnaby market, and the prime councillor of a distinguished nobleman for  whom privately he betted on commission. His secret service to-day was to  bet against his noble employer's own horse, and so he at once sung out,  \"Twenty to one against Man-trap.\"    A young gentleman just launched into the world, and who, proud of his  ancient and spreading acres, was now making his first book, seeing  Man-trap marked eighteen to one on the cards, jumped eagerly at this  bargain, while Lord Fitzheron and Mr Berners who were at hand and who in  their days had found their names in the book of the carcase butcher, and  grown wise by it, interchanged a smile.    \"Mr Egremont will not take,\" said Hump Chippendale to the peer in the  white great coat.    \"You must have been too eager,\" said his noble friend.    The ring is up; the last odds declared; all gallop away to the Warren.  A few minutes, only a few minutes, and the event that for twelve months  has been the pivot of so much calculation, of such subtile combinations,  of such deep conspiracies, round which the thought and passion of the  sporting world have hung like eagles, will be recorded in the fleeting  tablets of the past. But what minutes! Count them by sensation and not  by calendars, and each moment is a day and the race a life. Hogarth in  a coarse and yet animated sketch has painted \"Before\" and \"After.\" A  creative spirit of a higher vein might develop the simplicity of the  idea with sublimer accessories. Pompeius before Pharsalia, Harold before  Hastings, Napoleon before Waterloo, might afford some striking contrasts  to the immediate catastrophe of their fortunes. Finer still the inspired  mariner who has just discovered a new world; the sage who has revealed  a new planet; and yet the \"Before\" and \"After\" of a first-rate English  race, in the degree of its excitement, and sometimes in the tragic  emotions of its close, may vie even with these.    They are saddling the horses; Caravan looks in great condition; and a  scornful smile seems to play upon the handsome features of Pavis, as in  the becoming colours of his employer, he gracefully gallops his horse  before his admiring supporters. Egremont in the delight of an  English patrician scarcely saw Mango, and never even thought of  Phosphorus--Phosphorus, who, by the bye, was the first horse that  showed, with both his forelegs bandaged.    They are off!    As soon as they are well away, Chifney makes the running with Pocket  Hercules. Up to the Rubbing House he is leading; this is the only point  the eye can select. Higher up the hill, Caravan, Hybiscus, Benedict,  Mahometan, Phosphorus, Michel Fell, and Rat-trap are with the grey,  forming a front rank, and at the new ground the pace has told its tale,  for half a dozen are already out of the race.    The summit is gained; the tactics alter: here Pavis brings up Caravan,  with extraordinary severity,--the pace round Tattenham corner terrific;  Caravan leading, then Phosphorus a little above him, Mahometan next,  Hybiscus fourth. Rat-trap looking badly, Wisdom, Benedict and another  handy. By this time Pocket Hercules has enough, and at the road the  tailing grows at every stride. Here the favourite himself is hors de  combat, as well as Dardanelles, and a crowd of lesser celebrities.    There are now but four left in the race, and of these, two, Hybiscus  and Mahometan, are some lengths behind. Now it is neck and neck between  Caravan and Phosphorus. At the stand Caravan has decidedly the best,  but just at the post, Edwards, on Phosphorus, lifts the gallant little  horse, and with an extraordinary effort contrives to shove him in by  half a length.    \"You look a little low, Charley,\" said Lord Fitzheron, as taking their  lunch in their drag he poured the champagne into the glass of Egremont.    \"By Jove!\" said Lord Milford, \"Only think of Cockie Graves having gone  and done it!\"          Book 1 Chapter 3        Egremont was the younger brother of an English earl, whose nobility  being of nearly three centuries' date, ranked him among our high and  ancient peers, although its origin was more memorable than illustrious.  The founder of the family had been a confidential domestic of one of the  favourites of Henry the Eighth, and had contrived to be appointed one  of the commissioners for \"visiting and taking the surrenders of divers  religious houses.\" It came to pass that divers of these religious houses  surrendered themselves eventually to the use and benefit of honest  Baldwin Greymount. The king was touched with the activity and zeal  of his commissioner. Not one of them whose reports were so ample and  satisfactory, who could baffle a wily prior with more dexterity, or  control a proud abbot with more firmness. Nor were they well-digested  reports alone that were transmitted to the sovereign: they came  accompanied with many rare and curious articles, grateful to the taste  of one who was not only a religious reformer but a dilettante; golden  candlesticks and costly chalices; sometimes a jewelled pix; fantastic  spoons and patens, rings for the fingers and the ear; occasionally a  fair-written and blazoned manuscript--suitable offering to the royal  scholar. Greymount was noticed; sent for; promoted in the household;  knighted; might doubtless have been sworn of the council, and in due  time have become a minister; but his was a discreet ambition--of an  accumulative rather than an aspiring character. He served the king  faithfully in all domestic matters that required an unimpassioned,  unscrupulous agent; fashioned his creed and conscience according to the  royal model in all its freaks; seized the right moment to get sundry  grants of abbey lands, and contrived in that dangerous age to save both  his head and his estate.    The Greymount family having planted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#2)"],[1,"sand sloped gently to the sea,  and behind the level plain was thickly wooded.    \"This land,\" said Leif, \"shall also have a name after its nature.\"  So he called it Markland or Woodland.    Then again Leif and his companions returned to the ship, and mounting  into it they sailed away upon the sea.  And now fierce winds arose,  and the ship was driven before the blast so that for days these  seafarers thought no more of finding new lands, but only of the  safety of their ship.    But at length the wind fell, and the sun shone forth once more.  Then  again they saw land, and launching their boat they rowed ashore.    To the eyes of these sea-faring men, who for many days had seen  only the wild waste of waters, the land seemed passing fair.  For  the grass was green, and as the sun shone upon it seemed to sparkle  with a thousand diamonds.  When the men put their hands upon the  grass, and touched their mouths with their hands, and drank the  dew, it seemed to them that never before had they tasted anything  so sweet.  So pleasant the land seemed to Leif and his companions  that they determined to pass the winter there.  They therefore drew  their ship up the river which flowed into the sea, and cast anchor.    Then they carried their hammocks ashore and set to work to build  a house    When the house was finished Leif called his companions together  and spoke to them.    \"I will now divide our company into two bands,\" he said, \"so that  we may explore the country round about.  One half shall stay at  home, and the other half shall explore the land.  But they who go  to explore must not go so far away that they cannot return home at  night, nor must they separate from each other, lest they be lost.\"    And as Leif said so it was done.  Each day a company set out  to explore, and sometimes Leif went with the exploring party, and  sometimes he stayed at home.  But each day as evening came they all  returned to their house, and told what they had seen.    At length, however, one day, when those who had gone abroad returned,  one of their number was missing, and when the roll was called it  was found that it was Tyrker the German who had strayed.  Thereat  Leif was sorely troubled, for he loved his foster-father dearly.  So  he spoke sternly to his men, reproaching them for their carelessness  in letting Tyrker separate from them, and taking twelve of his men  with him he set out at once to search for his foster-father.  But  they had not gone far when, to their great joy, they saw their lost  comrade coming towards them.    \"Why art thou so late, oh my foster-father?\" cried Leif, as he ran  to him.  \"Why hast thou gone astray from the others?\"    But Tyrker paid little heed to Leif's questions.  He was strangely  excited, and rolling his eyes wildly he laughed and spoke in German  which no one understood.  At length, however, he grew calmer and  spoke to them in their own language. \"I did not go much farther  than the others,\" he said. \"But I have found something new.  I have  found vines and grapes.\"    \"Is that indeed true, my foster-father?\" said Leif.    \"Of a certainty it is true,\" replied Tyrker. \"For I was born where  vines grow freely.\"    This was great news; and all the men were eager to go and see  for themselves the vines which Tyrker had discovered.  But it was  already late, so they all returned to the house, and waited with  what patience they could until morning.    Then, as soon as it was day, Tyrker led his companions to the place  where he had found the grapes.  And when Leif saw them he called  the land Vineland because of them.  He also decided to load his  ship with grapes and wood, and depart homeward.  So each day the  men gathered grapes and felled trees, until the ship was full.  Then  they set sail for home.    The winds were fair, and with but few adventures they arrived safely  at home.  There they were received with great rejoicing.  Henceforth  Leif was called Leif the Lucky, and he lived ever after in great  honour and plenty, and the land which he had discovered men called  Vineland the Good.    In due time, however, Eric the Red died, and after that Leif the  Lucky sailed no more upon the seas, for his father's kingdom was now  his, and he must needs stay at home to rule his land.  But Leif's  brother Thorvald greatly desired to go to Vineland so that he might  explore the country still further.    Then when Leif saw his brother's desire he said to him, \"If it be  thy will, brother, thou mayest go to Vineland in my ship.\"    At that Thorvald rejoiced greatly, and gathering thirty men he  set sail, crossed the sea without adventure, and came to the place  where Leif had built his house.    There he and his company remained during the winter.  Then in the  spring they set forth to explore the coast.  After some time they  came upon a fair country where there were many trees.    When Thorvald saw it he said, \"It is so fair a country that I should  like to make my home here.\"    Until this time the Norsemen had seen no inhabitants of the land.  But now as they returned to their ship they saw three mounds upon  the shore.  When the Norsemen came near they saw that these three  mounds were three canoes, and under each were three men armed with  bows and arrows, who lay in wait to slay them.  When the Norsemen  saw that, they divided their company and put themselves in battle  array.  And after a fierce battle they slew the savages, save one  who fled to his canoe and so escaped.    When the fight was over the Norsemen climbed upon a, high headland  and looked round to see if there were signs of any more savages.  Below them they saw several mounds which they took to be the houses  of the savages, and knew that it behooved them therefore to be on  their guard.  But they were too weary to go further, and casting  themselves down upon the ground where they were they fell into a  heavy sleep.    Suddenly they were awakened by a great shout, and they seemed to  hear a voice cry aloud, \"Awake, Thorvald, thou and all thy company,  if ye would save your lives.  Flee to thy ship with all thy men,  and sail with speed from this land.\"    So Thorvald and his companions fled speedily to their ship, and  set it in fighting array.  Soon a crowd of dark-skinned savages,  uttering fearful yells, rushed upon them.  They cast their arrows  at the Norsemen, and fought fiercely for some time.  But seeing that  their arrows availed little against the strangers, and that on the  other hand many of their braves were slain, they at last fled.    Then, the enemy being fled, Thorvald, turning to his men, asked,  \"Are any of you wounded?\"    \"Nay,\" they answered, \"we are all whole.\"    \"That is well, \" said Thorvald. \"As for me, I am wounded in the  armpit by an arrow.  Here is the shaft.  Of a surety it will cause  my death.  And now I counsel you, turn homeward with all speed.  But  carry me first to that headland which seemed to me to promise so  pleasant a dwelling-place, and lay me there.  Thus it shall be seen  that I spoke truth when I wished to abide there.  And ye shall place  a cross at my feet, and another at my head, and call it Cross Ness  ever after.\"    So Thorvald died.  Then his companions buried him as he had bidden  them in the land which had seemed to him so fair.  And as he had  commanded they set a cross at his feet and another at his head, and  called the place Cross Ness.  Thus the first white man was laid to  rest in Vineland the Good.    Then when spring came the Norsemen sailed home to Greenland.  And  there they told Leif of all the things they had seen and done, and  how his brave brother had met his death.    Now when Leif's brother Thorstein heard how Thorvald had died he  longed to sail to Vineland to bring home his brother's body.  So once  again Leif's ship was made ready, and with five and twenty tall,  strong men Thorstein set forth, taking with him his wife Gudrid.    But Thorstein never saw Vineland the Good.  For storms beset his  ship, and after being driven hither and thither for many months,  he lost all reckoning, and at last came to land in Greenland once  more.  And there Thorstein died, and Gudrid went home to Leif.    Now there came to Greenland that summer a man of great wealth named  Thorfinn.  And when he saw Gudrid he loved her and sought her in  marriage, and Leif giving his consent to it, Thorfinn and Gudrid  were married.    At this time many people still talked of the voyages to Vineland,  and they urged Thorfinn to journey thither and seek to find out  more about these strange lands.  And more than all the others Gudrid  urged him to go.  So at length Thorfinn determined to undertake  the voyage.  But it came to his mind that he would not merely go to  Vineland and return home again.  He resolved rather to settle there  and make it his home.    Thorfinn therefore gathered about sixty men, and those who had  wives took also their wives with them, together with their cattle  and their household goods.    Then Thorfinn asked Leif to give him the house which he had built  in Vineland.  And Leif replied, \"I will lend the house to you, but  I will not give it.\"    So Thorfinn and Gudrid and all their company sailed out to sea,  and without adventures arrived safely at Leif's house in Vineland.    There they lived all that winter in great comfort.  There was no lack  of food either for man or beast, and the cattle they had brought  with them roamed at will, and fed upon the wide prairie lands.    All winter and spring the Norsemen dwelt in Vineland, and they saw  no human beings save themselves.  Then one day in early summer they  saw a great troop of natives come out of the wood.  They were dark  and little, and it seemed to the Norsemen very ugly, with great  eyes and broad cheeks.  The cattle were near, and as the savages  appeared the bull began to bellow.  And when the savages heard that  sound they were afraid and fled.  For three whole weeks nothing"]]]
