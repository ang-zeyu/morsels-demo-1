Her entire life is  sacrifice, and only sacrifice, to the bees as a race; as it were, to the  everlasting community, of which she forms part.    This, however, has not always been the case, for there is a lower order  of bees that prefers to work alone, and very miserably too, sometimes  never seeing its young, and at others, like the bumble-bee, living in  the midst of its own little family. From these we arrive, through one  stage after another, to the almost perfect but pitiless society of our  hives, where the individual bee exists only for the republic of which it  forms a part, and where that republic itself will at all times be  sacrificed in the interests of the immortal city of the future.          II    THE SWARM      We will now leave our observation hive, and, in order to get nearer to  nature, consider the different events of the swarm as they come to pass  in an ordinary hive, which is about ten times larger than the other, and  offers entire freedom to the bees.    Here, then, they have shaken off the sluggishness of winter. The queen  started laying her eggs in the very first days of February, and the  workers have gone in streams to the willows and nuttrees, the gorse and  violets, anemones and lungworts. Then Spring comes upon the earth, and  in the hive honey and pollen abound in cellar and attic, while each day  sees the birth of thousands of bees. The overgrown males now all sally  forth from their cells, and sun themselves on the combs. So crowded does  the city become that hundreds of workers, coming back from the flowers  in the evening, will vainly seek shelter within, and will be forced to  spend the night on the threshold of the hive, where many will die from  the cold.    The inhabitants of the hive become restless, and the old queen begins to  stir. She feels that there is something to be done; something strange,  that she has to do. So far, she has religiously fulfilled her duty as a  good mother; but, to her, the accomplishment of this duty will bring no  reward. An unknown power threatens her tranquillity; she will soon be  forced to quit this city of hers, where she has so long reigned. But  this city has been made by her. She is not its queen in the sense in  which men use the word. She gives no orders; she obeys, as meekly as the  humblest of her subjects, the hidden power that for the present we will  call the \"spirit of the hive.\" But she is the mother of the city; its  inhabitants are all her children. It is she who has founded it, brought  it together out of nothing, triumphed over the uncertainty and poverty  of its beginning; it is she who has peopled it; and those who move  within its walls--the workers, the males, the larvae, the nymphs and  young princesses--she is the mother of them all.      What is this \"spirit of the hive\"--where is it to be found? It is not  like the special instinct that teaches the bird to build its  well-planned nest, and then seek other skies when winter threatens. It  is not a fixed and unchanging habit; it is not a law that deals with  special cases. On the contrary, it deals with all cases; it studies  them, watches them--and then gives orders for the right thing to be  done--just as a faithful steward might do who had only the interests of  his master at heart.    It deals unmercifully with the wealth and the happiness, the liberty and  the life, of all this winged people; and yet it always acts with  judgment and wisdom, as though it were itself directed by some  overpowering duty. It is the \"spirit of the hive\" that decides how many  bees shall be born every day, arranging this in accordance with the  number of flowers that gladden the country-side. It is the \"spirit of  the hive\" that warns the queen when it is time to depart, that compels  her to allow the young princesses to come into the world, although these  princesses shall be her own rivals. Or perhaps, when the season is on  the wane, and the flowers are growing less plentiful, the spirit will  instruct the workers to do away with the princesses, so that there may  be no chance of disturbance, and work may once again become the sole  object of all.    The spirit of the hive is prudent and wise, but never niggardly. In the  glad summer days of sunshine and plenty it permits three or four hundred  males to exist in the hive--pompous, useless, noisy creatures, who are  greedy and dirty, vulgar and arrogant; but, one morning when the flowers  are beginning to close earlier and open later, the spirit will quietly  issue instructions that every male shall be killed. It draws up a sort  of time-table for each one of the workers, allotting them tasks in  accordance with their age; it selects the nurses who attend to the  larvae, and the ladies of honor who wait on the queen and never by any  chance let her out of their sight. It has given the necessary orders to  the house-bees who air and warm the hive by fanning their wings, thereby  also helping the honey to settle; to the architects, masons, waxworkers  and sculptors who form the mysterious curtain and build the combs; to  the foragers who sally forth to the flowers in search of the nectar that  turns into honey, of the pollen that feeds the larvae, and of the water  and salt required by the youth of the city.    It is the spirit of the hive that has chosen the chemists whose business  it is to keep the honey sweet and fresh by allowing a drop of formic  acid to fall in from the end of their sting; the capsule-makers, who  seal up the provision-cells when these are filled; the sweepers, who  clean the streets and public places of the hive; and the guards who all  day and all night keep watch on the threshold, who question all comers  and goers, recognize the young bees as they return from their very first  flight, scare away vagabonds, loafers and trespassers, expel all  intruders, and, if need be, block up and defend the entrance to the  hive.    And, last of all, it is the spirit of the hive which decides on the hour  at which the bees shall swarm; the hour, that is, when we find a whole  people, who have reached the very height of prosperity and power,  suddenly abandoning, in favor of the generation that is to follow, all  their wealth and their palaces, their homes and the fruits of their  labor, content themselves to face the perils and hardships of a journey  into a new and distant country. This act will always bring poverty with  it and sometimes ruin; and the people who once were so happy are  scattered abroad in obedience to a law that they recognize to be  greater than their own happiness.    These things that happen to the bee are regarded by us in the way we  regard most things that happen in the world. We note some of the bees'  habits; we say, they do this, and do that, they work in such and such a  way, this is how their queens are born; we observe that the workers are  all females and that they swarm at a certain time. And having said this,  we think that we know them, and ask nothing more. We watch them  hastening from flower to flower, we see the constant movement within the  hive; and we tell ourselves that we understand all about their life. But  the moment that we try to come nearer the truth, to see more clearly, we  find puzzling questions confronting us, questions as to what part is  played by destiny and what part by will, how much is due to  intelligence and how much to nature; difficult questions, these, that  are never absent even from the most simple acts of our own daily life.      Our hive, then, is preparing to swarm, making ready for the great  sacrifice to the generation that is to come. In obedience to the order  given by the \"spirit of the hive,\" sixty or seventy thousand bees out of  the eighty or ninety thousand that form the whole population, will  forsake their old city at a given hour. They will not be leaving it at a  moment of great unhappiness; they have not suddenly made up their minds  to abandon a home that has been rendered miserable by hunger or illness,  or ruined by war. No; on the contrary, preparations have for a long time  been made, and the hour most favorable for departure patiently awaited.    If the hive were poor, or had suffered from storm or robbery; or if some  misfortune had befallen the royal family, the bees would not dream of  going away. They do this only when everything is at its very best in the  hive; at a time when, thanks to the enormous amount of work done in the  spring, the immense palace of wax has its 120,000 well-arranged cells  overflowing with honey and with the many-colored flour, known as \"bees'  bread,\" on which the larvae are fed.    Never is the hive more beautiful than on the eve of its great sacrifice.  Let us try to imagine it for ourselves--not as it appears to the bee,  for we cannot tell what it looks like to her, seen through the triple  eye on her brow and the six or seven thousand facets of the eyes on her  side--but as it would seem to us, were we no bigger than she is. From  the height of a dome greater than that of St. Peter's at Rome waxen  walls descend to the ground; and these walls, although they have all  been built in the dark, are more perfect, more wonderful, than any that  have been erected by human hands. Each one, smelling so fresh and so  sweet, contains thousands of cells that are stored with provisions;  enough, indeed, to feed the whole population for weeks. Here, too, are  transparent cells filled with the pollen of every flower of spring,  making brilliant splashes of red and yellow, of black and mauve. Close  by, sealed with a seal to be broken only in days of distress, is the  honey of April, clearest and most perfumed of all, stored in twenty  thousand vats, which look like a long and beautiful embroidery of gold,  with borders that hang stiff and rigid. Lower down still, the honey of  May is maturing, in huge open tanks, that are fanned all the time by  watchful, untiring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38658"],[0,"Self-Instructor in the Art of Hair Work, Dressing Hair, Making Curls, Switches, (#2)"],[1," 1 at B, and the one in left hand at No. 1 at A; then bring back  No. 2 at B with right hand, and No. 2 at A in left hand, to the left,  then take No. 3 and swing to the right, then No. 4 and swing to the  left, so on, round first to the right then to the left, with every  number of strands till you get to No. 1; then commence as at first, and  so on till the chain is as long as required.
