Between 30 and 40 MYBP, a progenitor  split into the ursid and procyonid lineages, which evolved into  present-day bears, pandas, and raccoons (Wayne et al., 1989). The  taxonomic relatedness of pandas to bears and raccoons has been tested  extensively and a number of authors have summarized current thinking  on the problem (Martin, 1989; Wayne et al., 1989; Wozencraft, 1989a,  1989b; Decker and Wozencraft, 1991). Davis (1964:322-327) and others  (Leone and Wiens, 1956; Todd and Pressman, 1968; Sarich, 1976; O'Brien  et al., 1985) place the giant panda, _Ailuropoda melanoleuca_, with  the ursids. The taxonomic status of the red panda, _Ailurus fulgens_,  appears to be less certain. Some current investigations align the red  panda with bears (Segall, 1943; Todd and Pressman, 1968; Hunt, 1974;  Ginsburg, 1982; Wozencraft, 1984:56-110; 1989a), whereas others place  them intermediate to procyonids and bears (Wurster and Benirschke,  1968; Sarich, 1976; O'Brien et al., 1985), or in close relationship to  the giant panda (Tagle et al., 1986).    The procyonid radiation took place in North America and produced forms  that were mostly arboreal and omnivorous (Eisenberg, 1981:122; Martin,  1989). The center of this diversification occurred in Middle America  (Baskin, 1982; Webb, 1985b) during the Miocene (Darlington, 1963:367;  Webb, 1985b). Fossil procyonids from the late Miocene are represented  in Florida, California, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota  (Baskin, 1982; Martin, 1989) and include such genera as _Bassariscus_,  _Arctonasua_, _Cyonasua_, _Paranasua_, _Nasua_, and _Procyon_ (Baskin,  1982; Webb, 1985b). During the Miocene procyonids underwent a modest  radiation within tropical and subtropical climates of North America's  central and middle latitudes. _Cyonasua_, which has close affinities  to _Arctonasua_ (Baskin, 1982), appears in tropical South America in  the late Miocene and immigrated there either by rafting across the  Bolivar Trough or by island-hopping through the Antilles archipelagoes  (Marshall et al., 1982; Marshall, 1988). Thus, procyonids were found  on both continents prior to formation of the Panamanian land bridge  (Darlington, 1963:367, 395; Marshall et al., 1982; Marshall, 1988).  Origins of _Bassaricyon_ and _Potos_ are obscure but probably occurred  in tropical rainforests of Middle America (Baskin, 1982; Webb, 1985b).  A subsequent Pleistocene dispersal carried several modern genera  (Table 1) across the Panamanian land bridge into South America (Webb,  1985b). _Bassariscus_ and _Bassaricyon_ represent the most primitive  genera in Procyoninae and Potosinae subfamilies, respectively (Table 1;  Wozencraft, 1989a; Decker and Wozencraft, 1991).    In the early Tertiary, mid-latitudes of North America were much warmer  than they are now, but not fully tropical, and temperate deciduous  forests, associated with strongly seasonal climates, occurred only in  the far north (Barghoorn, 1953; Colbert, 1953; Darlington, 1963:589,  590). Major climatic deteriorations, with their attendant cooling of  northern continents, occurred during the Eo-Oligocene transition, in  the middle Miocene, at the end of the Miocene, and at about 3 MYBP  (late Pliocene). This last deterioration corresponds with closure of  the Panamanian isthmus (Berggren, 1982; Webb, 1985a). Climatic  deterioration went on at an accelerating rate during the late  Tertiary, with glacial conditions developing at the poles by the  mid-Pliocene (Barghoorn, 1953). Therefore, throughout the Tertiary, as  continents cooled, northern climate zones moved toward the tropics  (Barghoorn, 1953; Colbert, 1953; Darlington, 1963:589, 590, 594, 595;  Webb, 1985a).

[c] Several named forms of _Procyon_ are a single species,        _Procyon lotor_ (Wozencraft, 1989a).      During the late Miocene, late Pliocene, and Pleistocene, the Bering  land bridge between North America and Asia formed periodically,  offering an avenue for dispersal between northern continents  (Darlington, 1963:366; Webb, 1985a). However, by the late Tertiary,  northern continents had cooled to the extent that climate, with its  attendant sharply defined vegetative zones, became the major factor  limiting dispersal by this route (Darlington, 1963:366; Webb, 1985a).

LOUIS JOLIET,    RE-DISCOVERER OF THE MISSISSIPPI.      If one should ask which is the most important river basin in the world,  there is no doubt that the Mississippi would be named, with its million  and a quarter square miles of area and its twenty-five or more billions  of aggregated wealth. Favored in climate, soil, and navigable streams,  and endowed with practically inexhaustible veins of coal, copper, iron,  and silver, feeding the world with its hundreds of millions of bushels  of corn and wheat, and clothing it by other millions of bales of cotton,  it is hardly so astonishing that within 217 years from its discovery by  Joliet this greatest of river basins should be the abiding-place of  twenty-seven and a half millions of people.    Speaking of Joliet, Bancroft wrote that his short voyage brought him  immortality; but in the irony of fate his explorations have not even  given his name a place in the last edition of the Encyclopaedia  Britannica. In writing on American explorers, it seems most fitting that  this series of sketches should be headed by this Canadian, whose name  is scarcely known by one in a thousand. That aught is obtainable  concerning the details of his life is due to the investigations of Shea,  which later were admirably summed up by Parkman.    [Illustration: Signature of Jolliet (Old Spelling).]    Louis Joliet, the son of John Joliet and Mary d'Abancour, was born at  Quebec, September 21, 1645. His father was a wagon-maker, in the service  of the Company of One Hundred Associates, then owners of Canada.    The son in youth was imbued with devout feelings, which, possibly  fostered by the elder Joliet as certain to bring station and influence  in manhood, led to his being educated in the Jesuit College for the  priesthood, in which indeed he received the minor orders in 1662. Four  years later, in the debates on philosophy, which were participated in by  the Intendant and listened to by the colonial dignitaries, Joliet showed  such skill as to elicit especial commendation from the Fathers.    His future career shows that his studies with the Fathers were not lost  on him, and doubtless they contributed largely to make Joliet that  intelligent, well-poised leader who filled with credit all duties and  positions incident to his varied and adventurous life.    It is probable, however, that during all these years he was at heart a  true voyageur, and that his thoughts turned continually from the  cloister and books to the forest and its attractive life. Be this as it  may, he practically abandoned all ideas of the priesthood at the age of  twenty-two, and turned to the most certain, and indeed, in Canada, the  only path to wealth, that of a trader in furs with the Indians. In this  trade only the hardy, shrewd, intelligent, and tireless subordinate  could hope to thrive and rise. Success meant long and hazardous journeys  into the very heart of the Indian country, where were needed great  physical courage and strength, perfect skill with gun, paddle, axe,  sledge, or snow-shoe, a thorough knowledge of wood-craft, indomitable  will or casuistry and tact according to the occasion. To paddle a canoe  from sunrise to sunset of a summer day, to follow the sledge or break a  snow-shoe path before it as far as a dog can travel in a march, to track  a moose or deer for leagues without rest, to carry canoes and heavy  packs over long portages through an untravelled country, were the  ordinary experiences of a voyageur, which were accomplished for the  great part on a diet of smoked meat and boiled Indian corn, with no  shelter in fair weather and the cover of an upturned canoe or bark hut  in stress of storm.    Joliet did not long remain in private adventure, for in 1669 Talon, then  Intendant of Canada, sent him to discover and explore the copper-mines  of Lake Superior, in which quest he failed. It was on his return trip  that Joliet met with La Salle and the priests Dolier and Galinee, on  September 24, 1669, near the present town of Hamilton, in which  direction Joliet's Indian guide had misled him when returning from Lake  Erie, through fear of meeting enemies at the Niagara portage.    Joliet's facility for map-making in the field is evident from the fact  that at this time he showed to the priests with La Salle a copy of the  map that he had made of such parts of the upper lakes as he had visited,  and gave them a copy of it. He moreover evidenced continued interest in  religious matters by telling them that the Pottowattamies and other  Indian tribes of that region were in serious need of spiritual succor.  La Salle later, in November, 1680, repaid this frank tender of  information of the little-known west by intimating his belief that  Joliet never went but little south of the mouth of the Illinois, and is  also stated to have declared that Joliet was an impostor.    In his account of La Salle's last journey, Father Douay, referring to  Joliet's discoveries as related by Marquette, says: \"I have brought with  me the printed book of this pretended discovery, and I remarked all  along my route that there was not a word of truth in it.\"    The efforts to deprive Joliet of the credit of the original discovery of  the Mississippi falls before the despatch of Count Frontenac to Colbert,  then Minister, dated Quebec, November 14, 1674: \"VI. Sieur Joliet, whom  Monsieur Talon advised me, on my arrival from France, to despatch for  the discovery of the South Sea, has returned three months ago, and  discovered some very fine country, and a navigation so easy through the  beautiful rivers he has found, that a person can go from Lake Ontario  and Fort Frontenac in a bark to the Gulf of Mexico, there being only one  carrying-place, half a league in length, where Lake Ontario communicates  with Lake Erie.... He has been within ten days of the Gulf of Mexico....  I send you by my secretary the map he has made of it.... He has lost all  his minutes and journals in the shipwreck he suffered in sight of  Montreal.... He left with the Fathers at Sault St. Marie copies of his  journal.\"    But to return to the circumstances under which Joliet made the voyage.  Among other orders of Louis XIV. regarding Canada was a charge to  discover the South Sea and Mississippi, and Jean Talon, Intendant of  Canada, lost no chance of furthering this object. La Salle's journey of  1670 had failed to reach the great river, though he descended the Ohio  to the falls at Louisville, and at his recall in 1672 Talon had the  subject of further exploration in hand. Joliet had lately returned from  his unsuccessful efforts to discover copper mines on Lake Superior,  during which he had probably been the first white man to pass through  the Straits of Detroit. Despite his late failure he had impressed Talon  as the man best fitted to lead such an expedition, and so before sailing  for France the Intendant recommended Joliet for the work to Count  Frontenac, the new Governor.    In those days the Church and Government went hand in hand, and but few  French expeditions went westward from Montreal without a priest to carry  the faith to such Indian tribes as were allies of France or liable to be  won over. As Joliet's priest-associate, James Marquette, a young Jesuit,  then a missionary at St. Esprit, La Pointe, Lake Superior, was chosen.    No better man could have been sent. Marquette was in the prime of life,  an expert linguist--as he had learned in six years to speak fluently six  Indian languages--gentle, patient, and tactful with the natives, devout  in faith, singularly holy in life, fearless, imaginative, nature-loving  and observant, as shown by his journal, which, owing to Joliet's  shipwreck, is the only original story of the voyage. His enthusiasm is  shown by the opening sentences of his journal: \"I have obtained from God  the favor of being enabled to visit the nations on the Mississippi  River, ... and find myself in the happy necessity of exposing my life  for the salvation of all these tribes, especially the Illinois.\"    Joliet followed the St. Lawrence to Fort Frontenac, at the entrance of  Lake Ontario, and with the exception of the portage at the Falls of  Niagara, skirted in his canoe the shores of the Great Lakes until he  reached the Straits of Mackinaw, on the north side of which, at Point  St. Ignace, he found the enthusiastic Marquette devotedly laboring for  the spiritual welfare of the Hurons and Ottawas there gathered.    [Illustration: A Part of the Map Published in Paris by Thevenot as  \"Marquette's Map.\" It shows the route taken by Joliet across Wisconsin  from the Baie des Puans (now Green Bay) to the Mississippi River, also  part of the return journey, that is, from the present site of Chicago,  northward along Lake Michigan.]    The contemplated line of travel was that of Jean Nicollet, an  interpreter who had spent many years with the Indian tribes, who was  sent in 1638 to bring about a peace between the Hurons and Winnebagoes  who lived near Green Bay. After his negotiations he ascended the Fox  River, and making a portage to the Wisconsin, descended that stream some  distance, so that, as he thought, from the designation of \"the great  water\" by the Indian guide to the Mississippi, he was within three days  of the South Sea.    Joliet, however, was too practical to trust entirely to tradition or  oral description. He had already carefully charted all that was  definitely known of the western lake regions, and now at St. Ignace,  with Marquette's invaluable assistance, gathered all possible  information from such Indians at the mission as had frequented the  unknown country. This information being duly weighed and considered,  Joliet extended his map to cover all the new country, marking"]]]
