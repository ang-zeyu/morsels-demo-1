In the year 1847, I crossed the plains with the volunteers from St.  Louis, Missouri, going out to take part in the war with Mexico. At that  time the Comanche Indians were a power on the plains. The Battalion I  belonged to was attacked while in camp on the Arkansas River. On the  opposite side of the river were sand hills. Wood was very scarce in the  region and on arriving in camp, it was customary for a number of the  most active young men to go out in search of fuel, generally \"buffalo  chips.\"    On looking across the river there was seen a few small piles of what  looked like driftwood. This had been placed there by the Indians as a  decoy; but no suspicion was felt at the time, as we had heretofore seen  no Indians, neither was there anyone along who understood the Indians'  \"tricks.\"    Some thirty men started in haste for this wood. Only one man taking his  gun, one other had a small pocket pistol. A few of the most active men  secured the wood piled up, whilst the others remained gathering the  scattered sticks and picking berries that grew among the sand-hills.  Suddenly there charged upon them about twenty-five mounted Comanches.  Using their long, sharp spears they would ride a man down, spear him  through, catch him by the hair, and scalp him without dismounting.  They killed and scalped eight men, wounding and scalping another that  recovered. Although there was a battalion of infantry and a company of  cavalry in camp, this was done before help could reach the men. The men  in camp rushed across the river, firing at the Indians, who retreated  as soon as they were in danger. The cavalry company mounted and pursued  for some time but could not overtake the Indians. This was my first  introduction to Indians.    After this we were more watchful. Many attacks were made and men  killed in those days in open daylight in what might be termed a fair  field fight, while others were surprised, and sometimes whole parties  murdered, as was the mail company at Wagon Mound in 1849. Some of them  were personal friends of mine.    At that time, in common with white men generally, I looked upon all  Indians as fit only to be killed.    After the war was over, I remained in Mexico until July, 1850. Of my  stay in that country for some three years, I will give only a brief  sketch and write that which has a bearing on my future life and  actions, as will be given in this work. There are many things that have  occurred in my experience which might be interesting to some but not to  the general reader.    I will say this, and say it truly, I took part in many ways in the  wild, reckless life that was common in that land, so much so that I  often felt condemned, and longed for something to call me away from  where I was, and lead me from the evils I was surrounded by. I had much  pride, always believing myself better than many others. This caused me  to preserve myself from degradation. There was a feeling continually  with me, that if I would keep my body pure and healthy, I would yet  find a condition in life that would be satisfactory to me.    This spirit enabled me to abstain from strong drink and other worse  vices that I could see were destroying the lives of my associates.  Notwithstanding this, I found enough to practice in the way of  gambling, swearing, fighting, and other rough conduct to feel heartily  condemned in my own conscience.    While in Mexico I formed a kindly feeling toward many of the Mexican  people, studied the Spanish language, so as to read and write it and  act as interpreter.    My mind often reverts to those days. I had been left an orphan at  eleven years of age. I then left all my friends and relatives and went  out into the world alone, probably as willful a boy as ever lived. No  one could control me by any other means than kindness, and this I did  not often meet with. The result was, I found myself among rough people  in a wild country among those who knew no law but the knife and pistol.  The old Texas Rangers and many of the Missouri planters being the  leading characters.    I often wonder how I got through, and I can only account for it in one  way: I did not like this way of living. I felt condemned, and often  asked God in all earnestness to help me to see what was right, and  how to serve Him; telling Him I wanted to know positively, and not be  deceived. I felt that the people of this age ought to have prophets to  guide them, the same as of old, and that it was not a \"square thing\"  to leave them without anything but the Bible, for that could not be  sufficient or the people would not dispute so much over it. These  feelings grew upon me, and I began to be more careful of my conduct,  and felt a greater desire to leave the country.        CHAPTER II.    Learn of the \"Mormons\"--Leave with a Company bound for Salt Lake  Valley with Eight Thousand Sheep--My First \"Big Scare\"--Surrounded  and Threatened by Indians Many Times on the Road--Surrounded by Five  Hundred well-armed Warriors Demanding the Death of a Man from our Camp,  as the Chiefs son had Died--Meet with an Accident which nearly Resulted  in my Death.    In the summer of 1850, quite a large company fitted up at Santa Fe,  New Mexico, to go to California by the old Spanish trail, leading to  Salt Lake; thence by the northern route to Upper California. I had  heard some strange stories about the Mormons, such as were common at  that time. I heard of the Mormon Battalion and Pioneer move to Great  Salt Lake, a country then only known as the \"Great Desert of America,\"  that the Mormons had moved into the desert away from everyone, etc. My  sympathy was drawn toward them, for I had often felt as though I wanted  to find something different from anything yet seen. So when I heard  of this company being made up to go through the Salt Lake country, I  determined to make the trip with them.    At that time the Ute nation was very powerful, possessing the country  from near the settlements of New Mexico clear to Utah Valley. They  were known as a proud, haughty people, demanding tribute from all who  passed through their country, even in times of peace. The party fitting  up were taking through some eight thousand head of sheep. The old  mountaineers prophesied that we would never get through the Ute country  with so much to tempt the Indians.    However the owners concluded to risk the venture, as mutton was very  high at the mines in California.    We left the settlements of New Mexico at Abiquin, the trail soon  entering the wild mountain country, which was at that time only known  to a few venturesome traders, and to Mexicans. Very few white men  had ever been through the country. At the time of our trip the Utes  were supposed to be at peace; but peace in those days meant that if  they could rob without killing you, all well; but if necessary to do  a little killing without scalping they considered themselves quite  friendly. Scalping means hating. Often, when remonstrating with  Indians for killing people, they would say they did not scalp them. On  enquiring what this meant, I finally learned that the Indians believed  that in the spirit world friends recognized each other by the hair, and  when they were scalped did not know one another. This accounts for the  great risk they will run to remove those killed in battle to prevent  their falling into the hands of the enemy.    Nothing exciting occurred for several days after leaving the  settlements.    Our first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"minds.  To feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe, to  perform with scrupulous exactitude, as of the highest and holiest  import, practices which he inwardly ridicules, and which he intends on  his return to hold up to the ridicule of others, to turn for weeks and  months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his  Creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery, not to mention other  and yet darker touches,-all this seems hardly compatible with the  character of a European gentleman, let alone that of a Christian.\"    This comes admirably a propos from a traveller who, born a Protestant,  of Jewish descent, placed himself \"in connection with,\" in plain words  took the vows of, \"the order of the Jesuits,\" an order \"well-known in  the annals of philanthropic daring\"; a popular preacher who declaimed  openly at Bayrut and elsewhere against his own nation, till the  proceedings of a certain Father Michael    [p.xxii]Cohen were made the subject of an official report by Mr.  Consul-General Moore (Bayrut, November 11, 1857); an Englishman by  birth who accepted French protection, a secret mission, and the  \"liberality of the present Emperor of the French\"; a military officer  travelling in the garb of what he calls a native (Syrian) \"quack\" with  a comrade who \"by a slight but necessary fiction passed for his  brother-in-law[FN#2]\"; a gentleman who by return to Protestantism  violated his vows, and a traveller who was proved by the experiment of  Colonel (now Sir Lewis) Pelly to have brought upon himself all the  perils and adventures that have caused his charming work to be  considered so little worthy of trust. Truly such attack argues a  sublime daring. It is the principle of \"vieille coquette, nouvelle  devote\"; it is Satan preaching against Sin. Both writers certainly lack  the \"giftie\" to see themselves as others see them.    In noticing these extracts my object is not to defend myself: I  recognize no man's right to interfere between a human being and his  conscience. But what is there, I would ask, in the Moslem Pilgrimage so  offensive to Christians-what makes it a subject of \"inward ridicule\"?  Do they not also venerate Abraham, the Father of the Faithful? Did not  Locke, and even greater names, hold Mohammedans to be heterodox  Christians, in fact Arians who, till the end of the fourth century,  represented the mass of North-European Christianity? Did Mr. Lane  neverconform by praying at a Mosque in Cairo? did he ever fear to  confess it? has he been called an apostate for so doing? Did not Father  Michael Cohen prove himself an excellent Moslem at Wahhabi-land?    The fact is, there are honest men who hold that Al-Islam,    [p.xxiii]in its capital tenets, approaches much nearer to the faith of  Jesus than do the Pauline and Athanasian modifications which, in this  our day, have divided the Indo-European mind into Catholic and Roman,  Greek and Russian, Lutheran and Anglican. The disciples of Dr. Daniel  Schenkel's school (\"A Sketch of the Character of Jesus,\" Longmans,  1869) will indeed find little difficulty in making this admission.  Practically, a visit after Arab Meccah to Angle-Indian Aden, with its  \"priests after the order of Melchisedeck,\" suggested to me that the  Moslem may be more tolerant, more enlightened, more charitable, than  many societies of self-styled Christians.    And why rage so furiously against the \"disguise of a wandering  Darwaysh?\" In what point is the Darwaysh more a mummer or in what does  he show more of betise than the quack? Is the Darwaysh anything but an  Oriental Freemason, and are Freemasons less Christians because they  pray with Moslems and profess their belief in simple unitarianism?    I have said. And now to conclude.    After my return to Europe, many inquired if I was not the only living  European who has found his way to the Head Quarters of the Moslem  Faith. I may answer in the affirmative, so far, at least, that when  entering the penetralia of Moslem life my Eastern origin was never  questioned, and my position was never what cagots would describe as in  loco apostatae.    On the other hand, any Jew, Christian, or Pagan, after declaring before  the Kazi and the Police Authorities at Cairo, or even at Damascus, that  he embraces Al-Islam, may perform, without fear of the so-called Mosaic  institution, \"Al-Sunnah,\" his pilgrimage in all safety. It might be  dangerous to travel down the Desert-line between Meccah and Al-Madinah  during times of popular excitement; but the coast route is always safe.  To the \"new Moslem,\" however, the old Moslem is rarely    [p.xxiv] well affected; and the former, as a rule, returns home  unpleasantly impressed by his experiences.    The Eastern world moves slowly-eppur si muove. Half a generation ago  steamers were first started to Jeddah: now we hear of a projected  railroad from that port to Meccah, the shareholders being all Moslems.  And the example of Jerusalem encourages us to hope that long before the  end of the century a visit to Meccah will not be more difficult than a  trip to Hebron.    Ziyadeh hadd-i-adab!    RICHARD F. BURTON.    London, 31st March, 1879.      [Arabic text]    [p.xxv]PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.    The interest just now felt in everything that relates to the East would  alone be sufficient to ensure to the author of \"El Medinah and Meccah\"  the favourable consideration of the Reading Public. But when it is  borne in mind that since the days of William Pitts of Exeter (A.D.  1678-1688) no European travellers, with the exception of  Burckhardt[FN#3] and Lieut. Burton,[FN#4] have been able to send us  back an account of their travels there, it cannot be doubted but that  the present work will be hailed as a welcome addition to our knowledge  of these hitherto mysterious penetralia of Mohammedan superstition. In  fact, El Madinah may be considered almost a virgin theme; for as  Burckhardt was prostrated by sickness throughout the period of his stay  in the Northern Hejaz, he was not able to describe it as satisfactorily  or minutely as he did the Southern country,-he could not send a plan of  the Mosque, or correct the popular but erroneous ideas which prevail  concerning it and the surrounding city.    The reader may question the propriety of introducing    [p.xxvi]in a work of description, anecdotes which may appear open to  the charge of triviality. The author's object, however, seems to be to  illustrate the peculiarities of the people-to dramatise, as it were,  the dry journal of a journey,-and to preserve the tone of the  adventures, together with that local colouring in which mainly consists  \"l'education d'un voyage.\" For the same reason, the prayers of the  \"Visitation\" ceremony have been translated at length, despite the  danger of inducing tedium; they are an essential part of the subject,  and cannot be omitted, nor be represented by \"specimens.\"    The extent of the Appendix requires some explanation. Few but literati  are aware of the existence of Lodovico Bartema's naive recital, of the  quaint narrative of Jos. Pitts, or of the wild journal of Giovanni  Finati. Such extracts have been now made from these writers that the  general reader can become acquainted with the adventures and opinions  of the different travellers who have visited El Hejaz during a space of  350 years. Thus, with the second volume of Burckhardt's Travels in  Arabia, the geographer, curious concerning this portion of the Moslem's  Holy Land, possesses all that has as yet been written upon the subject.    The editor, to whom the author in his absence has intrusted his work,  had hoped to have completed it by the simultaneous publication of the  third volume, containing the pilgrimage to Meccah. The delay, however,  in the arrival from India of this portion of the MS. has been such as  to induce him at once to publish El Misr and El Medinah. The concluding  volume on Meccah is now in the hands of the publisher, and will appear  in the Autumn of the present year. Meanwhile the Public will not lose  sight of the subject of Arabia. Part of El Hejaz has lately been  inspected by M. Charles Didier, an eminent name in French literature,  and by the Abbe Hamilton,-persuaded, it is believed, by our author to    [p.xxvii]visit Taif and Wady Laymum. Though entirely unconnected with  the subjects of Meccah and El Medinah, the account of the Sherif's  Court where these gentlemen were received with distinction, and of the  almost unknown regions about Jebel Kora, will doubtless be welcomed by  the Orientalists and Geographers of Europe.    Mr. Burton is already known by his \"History of Sindh.\" And as if to  mark their sense of the spirit of observation and daring evinced by him  when in that country, and still more during his late journeyings in  Arabia and East Africa, the Geographical Society, through their learned  Secretary, Dr. Norton Shaw, have given valuable aid to this work in its  progress through the press, supplying maps where necessary to complete  the illustrations supplied by the author,-who, it will be perceived, is  himself no mean draughtsman.    It was during a residence of many years in India that Mr. Burton had  fitted himself for his late undertaking, by acquiring, through his  peculiar aptitude for such studies, a thorough acquaintance with  various dialects of Arabia and Persia; and, indeed, his Eastern cast of  features (vide Frontispiece, Vol. II.) seemed already to point him out  as the very person of all others best suited for an expedition like  that described in the following pages.    It will be observed that in writing Arabic, Hindoostannee, Persian, or  Turkish words, the author has generally adopted the system proposed by  Sir William Jones and modified by later Orientalists.[FN#5] But when a  word (like Fatihah for Fat-hah) has been \"stamped\" by general popular  use, the conversational form has been    [p.xxviii]preferred; and the same, too,"]]]
