There had  been various games, and a splendid tournament had taken place, in which  Don Fernando had broken lances with the bravest and most polished  cavaliers of the period--a period so celebrated for skilful jousters and  valiant warriors.    Night having come on, the dances, games, and jousts ceased, and great  bonfires were lighted up in the open places of the town and in the  surrounding fields, where the people continued the rejoicings until the  approach of morning. They mingled their songs and acclamations with the  continuous clanging of the bells and the sounds of the rustic musical  instruments used in those times, until the ladies and cavaliers filled  up the halls of the royal Alcazar. In them was to be celebrated a ball  well worthy of the festivities that had taken place on that memorable  day, the remembrance of which both Castilians and Leonese preserved for  long years after, on account of the favours which their king dealt out  to them with a generous hand.    If we were to paint with rich and vivid colours the halls in which was  assembled the Court of Don Fernando, we should perchance please readers  fond of the marvellous and magnificent. The picture would indeed be very  effective, but we should fail in strict adherence to truth, and in our  intention to sacrifice everything for its sake, during the long course  of events which we are about to describe. The spirit of independence  which reigned at that period in Castile had driven out the Eastern  luxury which the Moslims were in the habit of displaying, during four  centuries, in the southern parts of Spain. The contemporaries of the Cid  were as brave and manly as the heroes of Covadonga, but also as rude and  simple-minded as the first champions of the Holy Crusade, who had  succeeded in driving back into the African deserts the impious followers  of the Crescent. Light and flowers were the riches which abounded in the  halls of the Alcazar of Leon--light and flowers which are the riches of  the fields, the luxury of nature. However, if any discontented person  found those decorations too insignificant, he must have found  compensation in the beauteous dames and brave knights who moved about in  all directions, evidently well pleased and content. All were impatiently  awaiting the arrival of the king, which was to be the prelude to the  dancing and to the other amusements proper to the occasion and to the  period, when the voice of a page was heard above the buzz of the crowd,  announcing the approach of Don Fernando and his family. A profound  silence reigned throughout the saloons, and all looks were fixed on the  door which communicated with the royal apartments. And, indeed, Don  Fernando immediately appeared, accompanied by his queen Do[~n]a Sancha, by  his daughters Elvira and Urraca, by his sons, Sancho, Alfonso, and  Garcia, and by some grandees who, during the day, had had the honour of  accompanying him, and whom the king had invited to his table. Amongst  these last universal attention was centred on an old man of noble  appearance, to whom Don Fernando directed his conversation frequently  and with great kindness. That old grandee was the noble Diego Lainez,  lord of Vivar.    We have said that all looks were fixed on the royal family, but for our  credit sake, as true and accurate narrators, we must make an exception.  At one end of the principal hall a gentle maiden, who might count  perhaps twenty summers, was conversing, without paying attention to  their arrival, with a handsome youth not much more advanced in years.  The importunities of a rather ancient due[~n]a, who evidently feared that  they might be noticed, judging from the terrified way in which she  frequently gazed around, did not succeed in interrupting their  confidential chat, which to all appearance was of an amatory character.  The two young persons were Ximena, daughter of the Count de Gormaz, and  Rodrigo, son of Diego Lainez; the elderly lady, who showed herself so  uneasy, was Lambra, the due[~n]a of the young girl.    The conversation between them was indeed of the nature mentioned above,  for Rodrigo and Ximena loved each other from the years of their  childhood, and love was always the subject of their conversations. Let  us tell how the son of Diego Lainez and the daughter of Don Gome de  Gormaz first became lovers. Bonds of friendship and relationship--the  latter, however, rather distant--had united for very many years the two  families. On the occasion of the celebration of certain famous  tournaments at Vivar, Don Gome and his family repaired thither, and were  hospitably lodged in the house of Diego Lainez. Rodrigo at that time was  four years old, and Ximena, whose parents had brought her with them to  Vivar, but little younger. Diego Lainez, to do honour to his friends,  gave a banquet sufficiently splendid and abundant, when the traditional  frugality in his household is taken into consideration. On this occasion  the two gentlemen renewed their pledges of friendship.    Teresa Nu[~n]a, the noble wife of Diego, loved her son with a tenderness  only to be compared with that with which the wife of De Gormaz loved her  daughter. The children rivalled each other in beauty and grace, and the  two mothers started a friendly and praiseworthy discussion on that  subject, after the termination of the banquet. We call it praiseworthy,  because maternal pride is noble and holy, although it may appear  unreasonable to those who judge it dispassionately. That controversy  ended by all those present, including the fathers of the children,  agreeing that they were equal in beauty and grace, as they were almost  equal in age.    \"They seem made for each other,\" said Teresa Nu[~n]a. And from that opinion  a thought took birth which was received with enthusiasm by both  families--to enlace more and more their interests and friendship by the  union of Rodrigo and Ximena. The realisation of this project was  arranged for the time when the two fair scions of those noble families  would have completed their twentieth years; for in that iron age all the  risks to life and health attending the too early marriages of young  girls were, with good reason, avoided.    Love, and above all the love of a mother, is the source of the most  beautiful and poetic thoughts; thus it was that Teresa was inspired with  a very beautiful idea. It was, that the children should consecrate this  arrangement for their future union with a kiss, which also should be the  pledge of a love that commenced on that day. Teresa Nu[~n]a, therefore,  took Rodrigo by the hand and led him up to Ximena; he then sealed with  his pure lips the blushing cheek of the girl, who, in her turn, kissed  that of Rodrigo.    This compact was a bond which made the intercourse of the two families  more close than it had been before, and the two children grew up like  two flowers on one stem--brother and sister in their education as they  were also in their souls.    Many years passed, and nothing had disturbed the warm friendship of the  two noble families; however, some special privileges conferred on Diego  Lainez at the Court of King Fernando, with whom the two grandees had  enjoyed much favour, irritated De Gormaz, whose nature, to judge by some  circumstances which had arisen anterior to those which afterwards took  place, was widely different, in nobleness and generosity, from that of  Diego. Indeed, thanks to the prudence of the latter, a complete  estrangement had been avoided until a short time before the events which  we have narrated at the beginning of this chapter; but at last De Gormaz  took the initiative by ordering his daughter to have no communication  whatever with Rodrigo, threatening Lambra to expel her from his  household if she permitted such.    On the day of which we are now treating the exasperation and the anger  of De Gormaz rose to their highest point, on account of the kindness  shown by the king to Diego, and, on the other hand, by the coldness with  which he himself had been received, and above all, by the slight which  he considered had been cast on him, by his not having been invited to  the royal table, as had been Diego Lainez, to whom he attributed his  disgrace with the king. Certainly Diego was very far indeed from  meriting such an accusation on the part of his former friend, for on  that very day he had done his utmost to rehabilitate him in the eyes of  Don Fernando; the king, however, had just motives for complaint against  the count, and the good offices of De Vivar had been unavailing.    At the moment when the entry of the royal family into the saloons of the  Alcazar was announced, Don Gome was passing through them, accompanied by  his daughter. Although feeling much resentment, on account of the  coldness of the king, he did not wish to renounce all chance of  recovering the favour of Don Fernando, provoking afresh his resentment  by abstaining from joining his suite, and thus acting differently from  all the other cavaliers who were passing through the saloons. It so  happened that, charging Lambra with the care of his daughter, he  advanced towards the royal family. Rodrigo, who was watching for an  opportunity to speak to the young girl, saw heaven opened when he  perceived that she was free from the presence of her father, and flew to  her side despite the anxiety which he knew it would cause the due[~n]a.    Many days had passed since Ximena had seen him, and it is easy to  imagine what was her pleasure, taking into account the tender and old  love which united them.    \"Ximena!\" murmured Rodrigo in a low voice, trembling with emotion.    \"Rodrigo!\" whispered the girl, without being able to add another word.    \"By all the saints of the heavenly court,\" said the terrified due[~n]a,  directing an entreating gesture to Rodrigo, \"I ask you to depart hence,  for if the count sees you it will go ill with my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#2)"],[1," vein of musing.    From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly:  \"And you don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\"    8)    \"A likely place, isn't it?\" returned Mr. Enfield. \"But I happen to  have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\"    \"And you never asked about the--place with the door?\" said Mr.  Utterson.    \"No, sir: I had a delicacy,\" was the reply. \"I feel very strongly  about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the  day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a  stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone  goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last  you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own  back-garden and the family have to change their name. No, sir, I  make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the  less I ask.\"    \"A very good rule, too,\" said the lawyer.    \"But I have studied the place for myself,\" continued Mr. Enfield.  \"It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes  in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of  my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the  first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're  clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so  somebody must live there. And yet it's not so sure; for the  buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to  say where one ends and another begins.\"    9)    The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then,  \"Enfield,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"that's a good rule of yours.\"    \"Yes, I think it is,\" returned Enfield.    \"But for all that,\" continued the lawyer, \"there's one point I want  to ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the  child.\"    \"Well,\" said Mr. Enfield, \"I can't see what harm it would do. It  was a man of the name of Hyde.\"    \"H'm,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"What sort of a man is he to see?\"    \"He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his  appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. I  never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be  deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although  I couldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary-looking man, and  yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no  hand of it; I can't describe him. And it's not want of memory; for I  declare I can see him this moment.\"    Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a  weight of consideration.    \"You are sure he used a key?\" he inquired at last.    \"My dear sir...\" began Enfield, surprised out of himself.    10)    \"Yes, I know,\" said Utterson; \"I know it must seem strange. The  fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is  because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone  home. If you have been inexact in any point, you had better correct  it.\"    \"I think you might have warned me,\" returned the other, with a  touch of sullenness. \"But I have been pedantically exact, as you  call it. The fellow had a key; and what's more, he has it still. I  saw him use it, not a week ago.\"    Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man  presently resumed. \"Here is another lesson to say nothing,\" said he.  \"I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to  refer to this again.\"    \"With all my heart,\" said the lawyer. \"I shake hands on that,  Richard.\"    11)                              SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE    THAT evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre  spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of  a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a  volume of some dry divinity on his reading-desk, until the clock of  the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would  go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night, however, as soon as  the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his  business-room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private  part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll's Will,  and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was  holograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took charge of it now that it  was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of  it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry  Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were  to pass into the hands of his \"friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\"  but that in case of    12)    Dr. Jekyll's \"disappearance or unexplained absence for any period  exceeding three calendar months,\" the said Edward Hyde should step  into the said Henry Jekyll's shoes without further delay and free  from any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small  sums to the members of the doctor's household. This document had  long been the lawyer's eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and  as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the  fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr.  Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was  his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a  name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to  be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting,  insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped  up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.    \"I thought it was madness,\" he said, as he replaced the obnoxious  paper in the safe, \"and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\"    With that he blew out his candle, put on a great-coat, and set  forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of  medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and  received his crowding patients. \"If any one knows, it will be  Lanyon,\" he had thought.    The solemn butler knew and welcomed him;    13)    he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the  door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine.  This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a  shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided  manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and  welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the  man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine  feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school  and college, both thorough respecters of themselves and of each  other, and, what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed  each other's company.    After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject  which so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind.    \"I suppose, Lanyon,\" said he \"you and I must be the two oldest  friends that Henry Jekyll has?\"    \"I wish the friends were younger,\" chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \"But I  suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\"      \"Indeed?\" said Utterson. \"I thought you had a bond of common  interest.\"    \"We had,\" was the reply. \"But it is more than ten years since Henry  Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in  mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for  old sake's sake, as they say,    14)    I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific  balderdash,\" added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, \"would have  estranged Damon and Pythias.\"    This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr.  Utterson. \"They have only differed on some point of science,\" he  thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the  matter of conveyancing), he even added: \"It is nothing worse than  that!\" He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure,  and then approached the question he had come to put. \"Did you ever  come across a protege of his--one Hyde?\" he asked.    \"Hyde?\" repeated Lanyon. \"No. Never heard of him. Since my time.\"    That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back  with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro,  until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a  night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness  and besieged by questions.    Six o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so  conveniently near to Mr. Utterson's dwelling, and still he was  digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the  intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged,  or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness  of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield's tale went by    15)    before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware  of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure  of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor's;  and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down  and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room  in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling  at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the  curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo!  there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and  even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure  in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time  he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through  sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more  swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted  city, and at every street-corner crush a child and leave her  screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know  it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and  melted before his eyes; and thus it"]]]
