Mrs. Mill, as I have said, died in 1858,  after seven years of happy companionship with her husband, and was  buried at Avignon. The inscription which Mill wrote for her grave is too  characteristic to be omitted:--\"Her great and loving heart, her noble  soul, her clear, powerful, original, and comprehensive intellect, made  her the guide and support, the instructor in wisdom and the example in  goodness, as she was the sole earthly delight of those who had the  happiness to belong to her. As earnest for all public good as she was  generous and devoted to all who surrounded her, her influence has been  felt in many of the greatest improvements of the age, and will be in  those still to come. Were there even a few hearts and intellects like  hers, this earth would already become the hoped-for Heaven.\" These lines  prove the intensity of Mill's feeling, which is not afraid of abundant  verbiage; but they also prove that he could not imagine what the effect  would be on others, and, as Grote said, only Mill's reputation could  survive these and similar displays.    Every one will judge for himself of this romantic episode in Mill's  career, according to such experience as he may possess of the  philosophic mind and of the value of these curious but not infrequent  relationships. It may have been a piece of infatuation, or, if we prefer  to say so, it may have been the most gracious and the most human page in  Mill's career. Mrs. Mill may have flattered her husband's vanity by  echoing his opinions, or she may have indeed been an Egeria, full of  inspiration and intellectual helpfulness. What usually happens in these  cases,--although the philosopher himself, through his belief in the  equality of the sexes, was debarred from thinking so,--is the extremely  valuable action and reaction of two different classes and orders of  mind. To any one whose thoughts have been occupied with the sphere of  abstract speculation, the lively and vivid presentment of concrete fact  comes as a delightful and agreeable shock. The instinct of the woman  often enables her not only to apprehend but to illustrate a truth for  which she would be totally unable to give the adequate philosophic  reasoning. On the other hand, the man, with the more careful logical  methods and the slow processes of formal reasoning, is apt to suppose  that the happy intuition which leaps to the conclusion is really based  on the intellectual processes of which he is conscious in his own case.  Thus both parties to the happy contract are equally pleased. The  abstract truth gets the concrete illustration; the concrete illustration  finds its proper foundation in a series of abstract inquiries. Perhaps  Carlyle's epithets of \"iridescent\" and \"vivid\" refer incidentally to  Mrs. Mill's quick perceptiveness, and thus throw a useful light on the  mutual advantages of the common work of husband and wife. But it savours  almost of impertinence even to attempt to lift the veil on a mystery  like this. It is enough to say, perhaps, that however much we may  deplore the exaggeration of Mill's references to his wife, we recognise  that, for whatever reason, the pair lived an ideally happy life.    It still, however, remains to estimate the extent to which Mrs. Taylor,  both before and after her marriage with Mill, made actual contributions  to his thoughts and his public work. Here I may be perhaps permitted to  avail myself of what I have already written in a previous work.[1] Mill  gives us abundant help in this matter in the _Autobiography_. When first  he knew her, his thoughts were turning to the subject of Logic. But his  published work on the subject owed nothing to her, he tells us, in its  doctrines. It was Mill's custom to write the whole of a book so as to  get his general scheme complete, and then laboriously to re-write it in  order to perfect the phrases and the composition. Doubtless Mrs. Taylor  was of considerable help to him as a critic of style. But to be a critic  of doctrine she was hardly qualified. Mill has made some clear  admissions on this point. \"The only actual revolution which has ever  taken place in my modes of thinking was already complete,\"[2] he says,  before her influence became paramount. There is a curiously humble  estimate of his own powers (to which Dr. Bain has called attention),  which reads at first sight as if it contradicted this. \"During the  greater part of my literary life I have performed the office in relation  to her, which, from a rather early period, I had considered as the most  useful part that I was qualified to take in the domain of thought, that  of an interpreter of original thinkers, and mediator between them and  the public.\" So far it would seem that Mill had sat at the feet of his  oracle; but observe the highly remarkable exception which is made in the  following sentence:--\"For I had always a humble opinion of my own powers  as an original thinker, _except in abstract science (logic, metaphysics,  and the theoretic principles of political economy and politics.)_\"[3] If  Mill then was an original thinker in logic, metaphysics, and the science  of economy and politics, it is clear that he had not learnt these from  her lips. And to most men logic and metaphysics may be safely taken as  forming a domain in which originality of thought, if it can be honestly  professed, is a sufficient title of distinction.    Mrs. Taylor's assistance in the _Political Economy_ is confined to  certain definite points. The purely scientific part was, we are assured,  not learnt from her. \"But it was chiefly her influence which gave to the  book that general tone by which it is distinguished from all previous  expositions of political economy that had any pretensions to be  scientific, and which has made it so useful in conciliating minds which  those previous expositions had repelled. This tone consisted chiefly in  making the proper distinction between the laws of the production of  wealth, which are real laws of Nature, dependent on the properties of  objects, and the modes of its distribution, which, subject to certain  conditions, depend on human will.... _I had indeed partially learnt this  view of things from the thoughts awakened in me by the speculations of  St. Simonians_; but it was made a living principle, pervading and  animating the book, by my wife's promptings.\"[4] The part which is  italicised is noticeable. Here, as elsewhere, Mill thinks out the matter  by himself; the concrete form of the thoughts is suggested or prompted  by the wife. Apart from this \"general tone,\" Mill tells us that there  was a specific contribution. \"The chapter which has had a greater  influence on opinion than all the rest, that on the Probable Future of  the Labouring Classes, is entirely due to her. In the first draft of the  book that chapter did not exist. She pointed out the need of such a  chapter, and the extreme imperfection of the book without it; she was  the cause of my writing it.\" From this it would appear that she gave  Mill that tendency to Socialism which, while it lends a progressive  spirit to his speculations on politics, at the same time does not  manifestly accord with his earlier advocacy of peasant proprietorships.  Nor, again, is it, on the face of it, consistent with those doctrines of  individual liberty which, aided by the intellectual companionship of his  wife, he propounded in a later work. The ideal of individual freedom is  not the ideal of Socialism, just as that invocation of governmental aid  to which the Socialist resorts is not consistent with the theory of  _laisser-faire_. Yet _Liberty_ was planned by Mill and his wife in  concert. Perhaps a slight visionariness of speculation was no less the  attribute of Mrs. Mill than an absence of rigid logical principles. Be  this as it may, she undoubtedly checked the half-recognised leanings of  her husband in the direction of Coleridge and Carlyle. Whether this was  an instance of her steadying influence,[5] or whether it added one more  unassimilated element to Mill's diverse intellectual sustenance, may be  wisely left an open question. We cannot, however, be wrong in  attributing to her the parentage of one book of Mill, _The Subjection of  Women_. It is true that Mill had before learnt that men and women ought  to be equal in legal, political, social, and domestic relations. This  was a point on which he had already fallen foul of his father's essay on  _Government_. But Mrs. Taylor had actually written on this very point,  and the warmth and fervour of Mill's denunciations of women's servitude  were unmistakably caught from his wife's view of the practical  disabilities entailed by the feminine position.      III.    _Liberty_ was published in 1859, when the nineteenth century was half  over, but in its general spirit and in some of its special tendencies  the little tract belongs rather to the standpoint of the eighteenth  century than to that which saw its birth. In many of his speculations  John Stuart Mill forms a sort of connecting link between the doctrines  of the earlier English empirical school and those which we associate  with the name of Mr. Herbert Spencer. In his _Logic_, for instance, he  represents an advance on the theories of Hume, and yet does not see how  profoundly the victories of Science modify the conclusions of the  earlier thinker. Similarly, in his _Political Economy_, he desires to  improve and to enlarge upon Ricardo, and yet does not advance so far as  the modifications of political economy by Sociology, indicated by some  later--and especially German--speculations on the subject. In the tract  on _Liberty_, Mill is advocating the rights of the individual as against  Society at the very opening of an era that was rapidly coming to the  conclusion that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#2)"],[1,"Century.

DRESS DESIGN          Plates originally printed in collotype are now produced in half-tone          INTRODUCTION      The subject of Historical Costume covers such a multitude of detail that  a volume on each century could be written, with hundreds of  illustrations. Thus it is, most works on costume are expensive and  bewildering; but I hope this small practical handbook will be a useful  addition to the many beautifully illustrated works which already exist.    I have divided the matter into centuries and reigns, as far as possible,  in this small work, besides separating male and female attire, thus  simplifying reference. A special feature has also been made, of  supplying the maker or designer of dress with actual proportions and  patterns, gleaned from antique dresses, as far back as they could be  obtained; and I am much indebted to the authorities at the Victoria and  Albert Museum for the permission given me to examine and measure their  unique specimens; also to Mr. Wade, Mr. G.
