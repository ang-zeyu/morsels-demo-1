May-re!\" called a voice from the house.    \"Yes, Mamma!\"    \"You an' Cap'n Bill come in to supper.\"          CHAPTER 2    THE MERMAIDS      The next morning, as soon as Trot had helped wipe the breakfast  dishes and put them away in the cupboard, the little girl and Cap'n  Bill started out toward the bluff. The air was soft and warm and the  sun turned the edges of the waves into sparkling diamonds. Across  the bay the last of the fisherboats was speeding away out to sea,  for well the fishermen knew this was an ideal day to catch rockbass,  barracuda and yellowtail.    The old man and the young girl stood on the bluff and watched all  this with interest. Here was their world. \"It isn't a bit rough this  morning. Let's have a boat ride, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child.    \"Suits me to a T,\" declared the sailor. So they found the winding  path that led down the face of the cliff to the narrow beach below  and cautiously began the descent. Trot never minded the steep path  or the loose rocks at all, but Cap'n Bill's wooden leg was not so  useful on a downgrade as on a level, and he had to be careful not to  slip and take a tumble.    But by and by they reached the sands and walked to a spot just  beneath the big acacia tree that grew on the bluff. Halfway to the  top of the cliff hung suspended a little shed-like structure that  sheltered Trot's rowboat, for it was necessary to pull the boat out  of reach of the waves which beat in fury against the rocks at high  tide. About as high up as Cap'n Bill could reach was an iron ring  securely fastened to the cliff, and to this ring was tied a rope.  The old sailor unfastened the knot and began paying out the rope,  and the rowboat came out of its shed and glided slowly downward to  the beach. It hung on a pair of davits and was lowered just as a  boat is lowered from a ship's side. When it reached the sands, the  sailor unhooked the ropes and pushed the boat to the water's edge.  It was a pretty little craft, light and strong, and Cap'n Bill knew  how to sail it or row it, as Trot might desire.    Today they decided to row, so the girl climbed into the bow and her  companion stuck his wooden leg into the water's edge \"so he wouldn't  get his foot wet\" and pushed off the little boat as he climbed  aboard. Then he seized the oars and began gently paddling.    \"Whither away, Commodore Trot?\" he asked gaily.    \"I don't care, Cap'n. It's just fun enough to be on the water,\" she  answered, trailing one hand overboard. So he rowed around by the  North Promontory, where the great caves were, and much as they were  enjoying the ride, they soon began to feel the heat of the sun.    \"That's Dead Man's Cave, 'cause a skellington was found there,\"  observed the child as they passed a dark, yawning mouth in the  cliff. \"And that's Bumble Cave, 'cause the bumblebees make nests in  the top of it. And here's Smuggler's Cave, 'cause the smugglers used  to hide things in it.\"    She knew all the caves well, and so did Cap'n Bill. Many of them  opened just at the water's edge, and it was possible to row their  boat far into their dusky depths.    \"And here's Echo Cave,\" she continued, dreamily, as they slowly  moved along the coast, \"and Giant's Cave, and--oh, Cap'n Bill! Do  you s'pose there were ever any giants in that cave?\"    \"'Pears like there must o' been, Trot, or they wouldn't o' named it  that name,\" he replied, pausing to wipe his bald head with the red  handkerchief while the oars dragged in the water.    \"We've never been into that cave, Cap'n,\" she remarked, looking at  the small hole in the cliff--an archway through which the water  flowed. \"Let's go in now.\"    \"What for, Trot?\"    \"To see if there's a giant there.\"    \"Hm. Aren't you 'fraid?\"    \"No, are you? I just don't b'lieve it's big enough for a giant to  get into.\"    \"Your father was in there once,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"an' he says  it's the biggest cave on the coast, but low down. It's full o'  water, an' the water's deep down to the very bottom o' the ocean;  but the rock roof's liable to bump your head at high tide .\"    \"It's low tide now,\" returned Trot. \"And how could any giant live in  there if the roof is so low down?\"    \"Why, he couldn't, mate. I reckon they must have called it Giant's  Cave 'cause it's so big, an' not 'cause any giant man lived there.\"    \"Let's go in,\" said the girl again. \"I'd like to 'splore it.\"    \"All right,\" replied the sailor. \"It'll be cooler in there than out  here in the sun. We won't go very far, for when the tide turns we  mightn't get out again.\" He picked up the oars and rowed slowly  toward the cave. The black archway that marked its entrance seemed  hardly big enough to admit the boat at first, but as they drew  nearer, the opening became bigger. The sea was very calm here, for  the headland shielded it from the breeze.    \"Look out fer your head, Trot!\" cautioned Cap'n Bill as the boat  glided slowly into the rocky arch. But it was the sailor who had to  duck, instead of the little girl. Only for a moment, though. Just  beyond the opening the cave was higher, and as the boat floated into  the dim interior they found themselves on quite an extensive branch  of the sea. For a time neither of them spoke and only the soft  lapping of the water against the sides of the boat was heard. A  beautiful sight met the eyes of the two adventurers and held them  dumb with wonder and delight.    It was not dark in this vast cave, yet the light seemed to come from  underneath the water, which all around them glowed with an exquisite  sapphire color. Where the little waves crept up the sides of the  rocks they shone like brilliant jewels, and every drop of spray  seemed a gem fit to deck a queen. Trot leaned her chin on her hands  and her elbows on her lap and gazed at this charming sight with real  enjoyment. Cap'n Bill drew in the oars and let the boat drift where  it would while he also sat silently admiring the scene.    Slowly the little craft crept farther and farther into the dim  interior of the vast cavern, while its two passengers feasted their  eyes on the beauties constantly revealed. Both the old seaman and  the little girl loved the ocean in all its various moods. To them it  was a constant companion and a genial comrade. If it stormed and  raved, they laughed with glee; if it rolled great breakers against  the shore, they clapped their hands joyfully; if it lay slumbering  at their feet, they petted and caressed it, but always they loved  it.    Here was the ocean yet. It had crept under the dome of overhanging  rock to reveal itself crowned with sapphires and dressed in azure  gown, revealing in this guise new and unexpected charms. \"Good  morning, Mayre,\" said a sweet voice.    Trot gave a start and looked around her in wonder. Just beside her  in the water were little eddies--circles within circles--such as are  caused when anything sinks below the surface. \"Did--did you hear  that, Cap'n Bill?\" she whispered solemnly.    Cap'n Bill did not answer. He was staring with eyes that fairly  bulged out at a place behind Trot's back, and he shook a little, as  if trembling from cold. Trot turned half around, and then she  stared, too. Rising from the blue water was a fair face around which  floated a mass of long, blonde hair. It was a sweet, girlish face  with eyes of the same deep blue as the water and red lips whose  dainty smile disposed two rows of pearly teeth. The cheeks were  plump and rosy, the brows gracefully penciled, while the chin was  rounded and had a pretty dimple in it.    \"The most beauti-ful-est in all the world,\" murmured Cap'n Bill in a  voice of horror, \"an' no one has ever lived to--to tell the tale!\"    There was a peal of merry laughter at this, laughter that rippled  and echoed throughout the cavern. Just at Trot's side appeared a new  face even fairer than the other, with a wealth of brown hair  wreathing the lovely features. And the eyes smiled kindly into those  of the child. \"Are you a--a mermaid?\" asked Trot curiously. She was  not a bit afraid. They seemed both gentle and friendly.    \"Yes, dear,\" was the soft answer.    \"We are all mermaids!\" chimed a laughing chorus, and here and there,  all about the boat, appeared pretty faces lying just upon the  surface of the water.    \"Are you part fishes?\" asked Trot, greatly pleased by this wonderful  sight.    \"No, we are all mermaid,\" replied the one with the brown hair. \"The  fishes are partly like us, because they live in the sea and must  move about. And you are partly like us, Mayre dear, but have awkward  stiff legs so you may walk on the land. But the mermaids lived  before fishes and before mankind, so both have borrowed something  from us.\"    \"Then you must be fairies if you've lived always,\" remarked Trot,  nodding wisely.    \"We are, dear. We are the water fairies,\" answered the one with the  blonde hair, coming nearer and rising till her slender white throat  showed plainly.    \"We--we're goners, Trot!\" sighed Cap'n Bill with a white, woebegone  face.    \"I guess not, Cap'n,\" she answered calmly. \"These pretty mermaids  aren't going to hurt us, I'm sure.\"    \"No indeed,\" said the first one who had spoken. \"If we were wicked  enough to wish to harm you, our magic could reach you as easily upon  the land as in this cave. But we love little girls dearly and wish  only to please them and make their lives more happy.\"    \"I believe that!\" cried Trot earnestly.    Cap'n Bill groaned.    \"Guess why we have appeared to you,\" said another mermaid, coming to  the side of the boat.    \"Why?\" asked the child.    \"We heard you say yesterday you would like to see a mermaid, and so  we decided to grant your wish.\"    \"That was real nice of you,\" said Trot gratefully.    \"Also, we heard all the foolish things Cap'n Bill said about us,\"  remarked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#2)"],[1," speech,--a smile that was almost  reassuring.    \"I am not sorry,\" he said, in kindlier tone, \"for it is not much  pleasure waiting century after century for some one to command my  services.  I have often thought my existence uncalled for, since you  Earth people are so stupid and ignorant that you seem unlikely ever to  master the secret of electrical power.\"    \"Oh, we have some great masters among us!\" cried Rob, rather nettled at  this statement.  \"Now, there's Edison--\"    \"Edison!\" exclaimed the Demon, with a faint sneer; \"what does he know?\"    \"Lots of things,\" declared the boy.  \"He's invented no end of wonderful  electrical things.\"    \"You are wrong to call them wonderful,\" replied the Demon, lightly.  \"He really knows little more than yourself about the laws that control  electricity.  His inventions are trifling things in comparison with the  really wonderful results to be obtained by one who would actually know  how to direct the electric powers instead of groping blindly after  insignificant effects.  Why, I've stood for months by Edison's elbow,  hoping and longing for him to touch the Master Key; but I can see  plainly he will never accomplish it.\"    \"Then there's Tesla,\" said the boy.    The Demon laughed.    \"There is Tesla, to be sure,\" he said.  \"But what of him?\"    \"Why, he's discovered a powerful light,\" the Demon gave an amused  chuckle, \"and he's in communication with the people in Mars.\"    \"What people?\"    \"Why, the people who live there.\"    \"There are none.\"    This great statement almost took Rob's breath away, and caused him to  stare hard at his visitor.    \"It's generally thought,\" he resumed, in an annoyed tone, \"that Mars  has inhabitants who are far in advance of ourselves in civilization.  Many scientific men think the people of Mars have been trying to signal  us for years, only we don't understand their signals.  And great  novelists have written about the Martians and their wonderful  civilization, and--\"    \"And they all know as much about that little planet as you do  yourself,\" interrupted the Demon, impatiently.  \"The trouble with you  Earth people is that you delight in guessing about what you can not  know.  Now I happen to know all about Mars, because I can traverse all  space and have had ample leisure to investigate the different planets.  Mars is not peopled at all, nor is any other of the planets you  recognize in the heavens.  Some contain low orders of beasts, to be  sure, but Earth alone has an intelligent, thinking, reasoning  population, and your scientists and novelists would do better trying to  comprehend their own planet than in groping through space to unravel  the mysteries of barren and unimportant worlds.\"    Rob listened to this with surprise and disappointment; but he reflected  that the Demon ought to know what he was talking about, so he did not  venture to contradict him.    \"It is really astonishing,\" continued the Apparition, \"how little you  people have learned about electricity.  It is an Earth element that has  existed since the Earth itself was formed, and if you but understood  its proper use humanity would be marvelously benefited in many ways.\"    \"We are, already,\" protested Rob; \"our discoveries in electricity have  enabled us to live much more conveniently.\"    \"Then imagine your condition were you able fully to control this great  element,\" replied the other, gravely.  \"The weaknesses and privations  of mankind would be converted into power and luxury.\"    \"That's true, Mr.--Mr.--Demon,\" said the boy.  \"Excuse me if I don't  get your name right, but I understood you to say you are a demon.\"    \"Certainly.  The Demon of Electricity.\"    \"But electricity is a good thing, you know, and--and--\"    \"Well?\"    \"I've always understood that demons were bad things,\" added Rob, boldly.    \"Not necessarily,\" returned his visitor.  \"If you will take the trouble  to consult your dictionary, you will find that demons may be either  good or bad, like any other class of beings.  Originally all demons  were good, yet of late years people have come to consider all demons  evil.  I do not know why.  Should you read Hesiod you will find he says:      'Soon was a world of holy demons made,    Aerial spirits, by great Jove designed    To be on earth the guardians of mankind.'\"      \"But Jove was himself a myth,\" objected Rob, who had been studying  mythology.    The Demon shrugged his shoulders.    \"Then take the words of Mr. Shakespeare, to whom you all defer,\" he  replied.  \"Do you not remember that he says:      'Thy demon (that's thy spirit which keeps thee) is    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable.'\"      \"Oh, if Shakespeare says it, that's all right,\" answered the boy.  \"But  it seems you're more like a genius, for you answer the summons of the  Master Key of Electricity in the same way Aladdin's genius answered the  rubbing of the lamp.\"    \"To be sure.  A demon is also a genius; and a genius is a demon,\" said  the Being.  \"What matters a name?  I am here to do your bidding.\"          3.  The Three Gifts      Familiarity with any great thing removes our awe of it.  The great  general is only terrible to the enemy; the great poet is frequently  scolded by his wife; the children of the great statesman clamber about  his knees with perfect trust and impunity; the great actor who is  called before the curtain by admiring audiences is often waylaid at the  stage door by his creditors.    So Rob, having conversed for a time with the glorious Demon of  Electricity, began to regard him with more composure and less awe, as  his eyes grew more and more accustomed to the splendor that at first  had well-nigh blinded them.    When the Demon announced himself ready to do the boy's bidding, he  frankly replied:    \"I am no skilled electrician, as you very well know.  My calling you  here was an accident.  So I don't know how to command you, nor what to  ask you to do.\"    \"But I must not take advantage of your ignorance,\" answered the Demon.  \"Also, I am quite anxious to utilize this opportunity to show the world  what a powerful element electricity really is.  So permit me to inform  you that, having struck the Master Key, you are at liberty to demand  from me three gifts each week for three successive weeks.  These gifts,  provided they are within the scope of electricity, I will grant.\"    Rob shook his head regretfully.    \"If I were a great electrician I should know what to ask,\" he said.  \"But I am too ignorant to take advantage of your kind offer.\"    \"Then,\" replied the Demon, \"I will myself suggest the gifts, and they  will be of such a character that the Earth people will learn the  possibilities that lie before them and be encouraged to work more  intelligently and to persevere in mastering those natural and simple  laws which control electricity.  For one of the greatest errors they  now labor under is that electricity is complicated and hard to  understand.  It is really the simplest Earth element, lying within easy  reach of any one who stretches out his hand to grasp and control its  powers.\"    Rob yawned, for he thought the Demon's speeches were growing rather  tiresome.  Perhaps the genius noticed this rudeness, for he continued:    \"I regret, of course, that you are a boy instead of a grown man, for it  will appear singular to your friends that so thoughtless a youth should  seemingly have mastered the secrets that have baffled your most learned  scientists.  But that can not be helped, and presently you will become,  through my aid, the most powerful and wonderful personage in all the  world.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Rob, meekly.  \"It'll be no end of fun.\"    \"Fun!\" echoed the Demon, scornfully.  \"But never mind; I must use the  material Fate has provided for me, and make the best of it.\"    \"What will you give me first?\" asked the boy, eagerly.    \"That requires some thought,\" returned the Demon, and paused for  several moments, while Rob feasted his eyes upon the gorgeous rays of  color that flashed and vibrated in every direction and surrounded the  figure of his visitor with an intense glow that resembled a halo.    Then the Demon raised his head and said:    \"The thing most necessary to man is food to nourish his body.  He  passes a considerable part of his life in the struggle to procure food,  to prepare it properly, and in the act of eating.  This is not right.  Your body can not be very valuable to you if all your time is required  to feed it.  I shall, therefore, present you, as my first gift, this  box of tablets.  Within each tablet are stored certain elements of  electricity which are capable of nourishing a human body for a full  day.  All you need do is to toss one into your mouth each day and  swallow it.  It will nourish you, satisfy your hunger and build up your  health and strength.  The ordinary food of mankind is more or less  injurious; this is entirely beneficial.  Moreover, you may carry enough  tablets in your pocket to last for months.\"    Here he presented Rob the silver box of tablets, and the boy, somewhat  nervously, thanked him for the gift.    \"The next requirement of man,\" continued the Demon, \"is defense from  his enemies.  I notice with sorrow that men frequently have wars and  kill one another.  Also, even in civilized communities, man is in  constant danger from highwaymen, cranks and policemen.  To defend  himself he uses heavy and dangerous guns, with which to destroy his  enemies.  This is wrong.  He has no right to take away what he can not  bestow; to destroy what he can not create.  To kill a fellow-creature  is a horrid crime, even if done in self-defense.  Therefore, my second  gift to you is this little tube.  You may carry it within your pocket.  Whenever an enemy threatens you, be it man or beast, simply point the  tube and press this button in the handle.  An electric current will  instantly be directed upon your foe, rendering him wholly unconscious  for the period of one hour."]]]
